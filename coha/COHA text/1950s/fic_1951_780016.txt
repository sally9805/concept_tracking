 | " It was a magnificent action , " Barney said . " Even though it was ours ? " " Even though it was yours . " She was silent . Then she said positively , " I can not endure his widow . " Barney kept from smiling . She went right on . " My husband had put all his money in Harris and Company . " Barney said , " You mean Joshua bullied it out of him . " Douglass said heatedly , " Naturally James trusted Joshua . I do , too ! But my shares in the business ca n't pay their interest during wartime . " " There 's a measure of truth in that , " he said . " American merchants have all they can do to keep our credit partially stable . So he offered you his home ? " " Yes , " said Douglass . " Yes , Captain Barney . But I leave this ship at Corunna . " " Well , " said Barney , " that 's all I wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . She had not forgotten the storm ; at this moment the ship plunged violently . " Oh , " she cried . She slid off the bunk . Then she blurted , " Barney ! Please do n't leave me ! " He looked down at her . " I 'm sleepy , Mrs. Harris . " The ship pitched again , and he caught her . " That remark was not an innuendo , " he said , to her averted face . He set her down on the bunk again . " When I make love to you ? " he stopped . Douglass saw his boot rest for a moment on the side of the bunk and then he swung up onto the top berth . He stuck his head over and laughed at her . " Goodnight , " he said . " I 'll sleep here . Look out below . " His boots dropped one by one . Douglass sat on the bunk , her feet hanging over , almost touching the big boots . She could hear him stretching himself comfortably above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the myriad sounds of the ship as she groaned her way through the heavy seas . Almost rhythmically great masses of water hit the deck and roared overhead . Suddenly she heard Barney say sleepily : " Is your dress woolen ? " She looked up , peering around the edge of the berth . He had stuck his head over again . " Yes . " He nodded , satisfied . " Otherwise I 'd tell you to change it . You 'd catch cold . I would n't look , " he added , his eyes twinkling .  | She sat still on the bunk . Finally she put her feet up . The noises continued . The ship shook and shuddered and protested mightily . Outside the port she could see the foaming masses of angry water that hurled themselves at the ship 's sides . Above all sounded the high screaming of the wind in the rigging . It was cold . She pulled a blanket up over her , and then wondered if Barney were covered . He was evidently sound asleep . She pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . She could not possibly stand without holding on . The cabin lurched back and forth . She stood on tiptoe and looked at Barney . He had pulled up a blanket . One big hand dangled over the side of the bunk . She touched the tips of his fingers with hers . The blanket had slipped off his shoulders , and she pulled it up further . Standing there , hanging on with one hand , she put her hand lightly on his dark head . Then she withdrew it quickly and scrambled back onto the bunk . Two hours later Joshua opened the door . It had been no use knocking . Knocks could not be heard . He opened the door and stood there . As he saw into the cabin his face changed . He could hardly believe what he saw . His blue eyes blazed with anger . " Come here ! " Amazed , Douglass obeyed . She almost catapulted toward him and he caught her with angry hands , pulling her through the door and shutting it . " For Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm tight . He glowered at her . " Do you want to seriously compromise your name , sister ? " She retorted , angry too , " I asked him to stay ! " This rendered him speechless . Finally he said , " As your brotherin-law , I ? " She interrupted . " My own brother would have been amused ! " " I am not amused ! This is not England but an American ship ! I 'm perfectly well aware of the antics of the ruling class in England , but you ca n't cut those capers here ! " " I will do as I please ! " " Not with my name , you wo n't ! " Douglass retreated before the male wrath . " Joshua , " she whispered and looked up at him . He said , calmer , " And of all men , to pick Barney . You 'll get your  | fingers badly burned , Douglass . You have about as much experience dealing with a man like him as you do with powder kegs . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? " Another thought struck her . " You would n't forbid him to call on me ? " He looked surprised . " Of course not . But what makes you think he might have honorable intentions ? " He smiled a little . " If he does , you should n't have let him enter your cabin . Poor strategy . " " I could n't stop him . " Joshua said , " I believe that proves my previous point . It 's two o'clock , sister , and they are serving a cold dinner in the after cabin . " They had reached it . " The fires have had to be extinguished , of course , " Joshua went on . " I will present you to Major Jackson and Charles Adams , and then I will go back to your cabin . " His grimness had returned . Douglass cried , " Oh , no , please , Joshua . " He shook his head . " No , " she cried again . " At least wait a bit ! He may waken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew he was there ! Wait  --  till we eat ! For my sake , Joshua ! " She was clinging to his arm . Joshua looked down at her , at her face in the dim grey light . Even he was having trouble keeping his balance . She had spoken in staccato sentences , her voice high to carry through the noises of the storm . The weather was worsening rapidly . He disengaged his arm , and opened the cabin door . He had not made up his mind whether to heed her . He drew her into the cabin ; Trumbull came quickly to her side to take her other arm in support . Joshua presented her to the other two men within . The cabin was not large ; the " South Carolina " was a ship of war , carrying twentyeight twenty-two pounders on the main deck and sixteen long twelves on the forecastle and quarterdecks . The cabin was grey and dim and frightening ; through the stern windows only blank greyness showed . Major Jackson was saying : " The mist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern out on deck . " Douglass saw that he was wet . " You 've been out on deck ? " Douglass asked . He said , " Lord no , ma'am . I collared Smith , the first lieutenant , just as the hatch was opened . "  | " What did you find out , Major ? " Joshua asked . Douglass surmised that the men knew he had gone for information . There was an awful shuddering sound and Jackson slid halfway across the cabin . Joshua and Trumbull held onto Douglass . Jackson steadied himself and answered Joshua , his face grim . " He told me that several of the bolts of the weather main chain plates have been started . We are not far from Heliogoland , and the northward trend of the coast . Our position is hazardous because we are drifting to leeward . " He paused . Then he said strongly , " I know something about commanding men . These officers have no respect or confidence in Gillon . If they do n't , the crew does n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fixed Joshua with a questioning eye . Joshua said , " I personally voted against Gillon 's appointment ? it was political . Come over here and sit down , Douglass . " Almost behind her was a locker running at right angles to the locker under the windows . " Can you eat ? " She shook her blond head . One curl had come loose and bounced on her forehead . She had a white woolen shawl with a fringe around her shoulders . " Mistress Harris , " Trumbull said , " we are not sailors . It probably is n't as bad as we think . " He leaned over and patted her hand . Douglass threw a look at Joshua . Jackson said , " Where is Barney ? " The four men looked at each other . Douglass cried , " He is asleep ! " They transferred their gaze to her ; she was leaning forward , her breast rising and falling with her quick breath ; she added , " At least so we  --  so he told me  --  that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to the other . Joshua broke the silence . " There 's very bad blood between Barney and Gillon . " He frowned , grimly . " Gillon is captain of this ship ! " " I do n't give a damn , " Jackson began . They had begun to shout . Quick terror seized Douglass . The whole cabin stood on end , an enormous crash came from above . Douglass leaped to her feet in horrified fear . " Call him , " she cried to Jackson . " He can not take command ! " Joshua shouted at Jackson . " Not without jeopardizing his ? " The cabin door flew open and banged back against its frame . The first lieutenant stood there , dripping wet , breathing hard . " Are all  | passengers here ? " he cried . Feet pounded along the deck outside the door , like three or four men , running . Smith whirled . The crew were out of hand , they had succumbed to terror , he knew . Suddenly another pair of steps sounded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the door , to let Barney enter . Barney towered there , he had to bend his head to miss the beams ; he . did so instinctively . His dark eyes went from the faces of the men in the cabin to Douglass . Douglass stood up . The ship 's roll sent her staggering to Barney . He caught and held her disheveled figure upright . He looked over her head to the others . He spoke quickly ; he did n't have much time . " I shall need your testimony , gentlemen , " he said briefly . He lifted Douglass and set her down on the locker . " Mr. Smith ! " Smith cried , " Yes , Captain Barney ! " " I 'm taking command of this ship . Her movements are ungoverned . Mr. Smith , where is Captain Gillon ? " " On deck , sir ! " " You can count on our testimony , Captain , " Joshua said . Barney heard him but made no answer to him save a nod . " Come with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried Smith , a bit of hope in his voice . They were foundering , he knew . He and Barney together flung themselves at the hatchway , putting strong shoulders to it . A wall of water poured in . Barney waited a second to let it pour down , then he was up the companionway with Smith right after him . They had just time to bang the hatch closed and fasten it before a towering wave was upon them . Both of them again flung themselves on the hatch and hung on . Tons of water came down on the stricken " South Carolina . " Barney felt her heel over helplessly as she wallowed down the trough . He let go the hatch and dived for the binnacle head . Storm . It was all around him , raging , shrieking . Rain swept almost horizontally across the face of the heaving seas ; the day was grey-black , and great foamy white waves towered endlessly . Above all this was the tearing wind , gale force , hurricane force . For only a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was roared out against the wind . In that time he saw the men clinging in the tops , indeed it was much safer there . He saw Gillon , clinging to the grating , where he was calling down to the men at the relieving tackles , for the two men at the wheel could not possibly  | deleted paragraph " Mr. Smith , " Barney roared . " Hands to braces in the maintops . " " Aye aye , sir , " the answer came singing back . Dead ahead towered another wave . He bellowed orders to the helmsman ; this time there was only a short period of plunging before she was brought around to the wind again . The howling squall raced across the surface of the seas from the northwest now . Under his feet the planking opened and shut . The ship shuddered , bucking like a mad thing , but she was not ungoverned . The storm canvas rattled in the wind as the squall heeled her over again . Barney clung to the binnacle head , eyes narrowed against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get off my deck ! " Barney paid no attention . " Hold her so ! " he shouted . Another enormous wave was racing toward them , foam on its lips as it curled angrily toward the ship . If he could n't keep her from drifting to leeward , they would be dashed to pieces on the rending sands of the coast here , as it reached out into the sea . Gillon grabbed for Barney . Barney raised a murderous fist and struck him with all his might . Gillon rolled back into the grating . The wave broke . Barney gave no more thought to Gillon , who lay on his face on the grating and hung on . He did n't see him stumble from the deck after the wave had passed . He only knew she was riding the storm now ; she was a weatherly ship ; he 'd known it from the minute he 'd laid eyes on her . The most terrible danger had passed now ; it took only a few moments of heavy squall to sink a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could snap out more commands .  | " Mr. Smith ! Check the breechings on the guns ! And set the storm staysails ! " Water hissed along the deck and through the scuppers . Barney thought the wind was diminishing ; those squall winds never lasted too long . It was God 's mercy they did n't . But the men on the pumps should be relieved ; probably there was no order below decks . She was paying off now before the wind and Barney shouted down to the helmsman . This time she was brought around quickly . The watch was obeying his every order . He was well aware that the magic of his name had enforced the discipline , over and above that of Gillon . The lookout shouted down that there was a ship . He told himself , as he stood there , by the mizzen rigging now , that it had been the only possible course open to him . Now he was enjoying the storm . He was soaking wet , hatless , but by God he was alive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in rather poor case when I took over , Mr. Smith , " Barney had time to say . " The ? " " We were foundering , Captain , " Smith said baldly . " I put a new gang at the chain pumps , as you ordered . " A figure was running toward them carrying an oilskin and cap . " Officer of the fo'castle , Mr. Hutchinson , " Smith said , as Hutchinson handed the oilskin to Barney . Hutchinson fastened his eyes on the famous seaman . " You saved us from Davy Jones , sir , " he said . Barney shrugged on the oilskin . It was the way of the sea that only minutes had elapsed , and a few orders could save a ship . At ten o'clock the " South Carolina " was still hauling to westward under reefed tops . Joshua had fallen asleep . In his cabin Trumbull wrote quickly , his pen scratching along the paper . " A squall struck us , heavier than the gale , the ship became unmanageable , the officers lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while for a few minutes all was confusion and dismay . " Trumbull dipped his pen . " Happily for us , Captain Barney was among the passengers ? he had just escaped from Mill Prison , in England . Hearing the increased tumult aloft , and feeling the ungoverned motion of the ship , he flew up on deck , saw the dangers , assumed command ; the men obeyed and he soon had her again under control . That our danger was imminent no one will doubt . " He laid down his pen . He was going to ask Barney for permission to paint him . But Joshua  | had made it quite clear that Barney might get into serious trouble over this . For a moment Trumbull wondered whether trouble followed Barney . He could not have done anything else , this day . Douglass slipped quietly out of the cabin door . She was still wearing the maroon wool dress . She came out on deck , and for a moment stood in the shadow of one of the long guns . Over her head the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rigging sang . Fore she could see the gleaming white of the headsails as they were blown stiff , angled from the bowsprit , so white against the black seas that curled up and foamed away from the gilded lion figurehead . Lanterns shone on the lifeboats , and at the mastheads ; two men were still at the wheel . She could see the figures of the watch moving about the deck and she saw Barney . He had his back to her . She crossed the deck to him . For a moment she caught a look of surprise that she had sought him out . Then he drew her over to the weather side of the quarterdeck . She lifted her face to his . " You saved the ship , " she said solemnly . Barney said , " You 're so beautiful , English . " She paid no attention . She was still looking up at his dark face . " We  --  we all thank you . The officers told us  --  Mr. Smith said if it had not been for you we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sands there . " She gestured to the east . Barney said , " A northwest squall often follows the northeast storms . " The spray suddenly flew high . He put his arm around her ; he took out his handkerchief and carefully wiped off her face . " Thank you , " she said . Barney gave a last wipe at her chin . She said , " You owe me a handkerchief . " Her fingers closed over it and she took it from him , and used it on her forehead . The wind cried a little . " Barney , " she said low , into his shoulder . " Yes ? " She hesitated . " It is a different ship now because no one is afraid . But ? " slowly she raised her lashes , still wet and stuck together . He knew what she was trying to ask . She might suspect , too , that his violence against Gillon would be exaggerated and she would he right . He said only , " I shall not surrender command until eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corunna. "  | She was well aware that all his plans had now gone awry . " I 'm sorry , Barney , " she whispered . " Do n't be , " he grinned . " I 'm going to order you below now . You are exhausted ; you 've kept a long vigil . And I want my handkerchief back . " Douglass stepped back . " No , " she said , her fingers tight around the linen square . He made a fierce mock scowl . " On my own quarterdeck , you dare to say no ? " She backed away , but she could n't go far for a gun carriage stopped her . Barney loomed over her . She put both hands behind her back . " I want it , Barney . " " You ca n't have it . " " You owe it to me ! " He slid one arm around her hand and took her wrist , unfastening her fingers . " I always repay my debts in my own way , " he said , drawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . It blew in the wind . " Brute , " she said , leaning back on the gun , laughing at him . " Now get off my deck . You 're confined to quarters . " She looked up at him . Had he been English , she was sure he would have his own squadron by now , and a captain 's rank . " What they say about you is true , " she said gravely . " You are a magnificent seaman . It is a pity that you ? " This time his frown was real . " No , English . " He shook his head . " I sink English ships . " A wry smile touched her lips . " Yes , of course . Goodnight , Yank . " She swept him a curtsy . Then she turned . Her voice floated back to him . " Thank you for my English hide . " 10 CORUNNA WAS THE NORTHERNMOST PORT IN SPAIN . THE " SOUTH Carolina " had put in at eight in the morning . The evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired on a Spanish ship , mistaking her for a Britisher . She  | deleted paragraph Trumbull looked up , shading his eyes with his hand . Douglass was wearing a wide-brimmed hat with a sprinkling of roses to match i her rose-colored filmy gown . " If this were the right light I could sketch you , Mrs. Harris , " Trumbull said , squinting up at her . " But I 'll paint you going home . " Douglass said , " You 're sailing with us ? " Trumbull nodded . " We could n't very well stay aboard the South Carolina . ' We wanted to back up Barney . " Douglass said warmly , " Oh , I 'm glad , Mr. Trumbull . " Her smile was so delighted that Trumbull grinned too . " One of America 's lustiest sons , Mrs. Harris . " Douglass forgot Joshua 's injunctions . " A damned elusive male , sir , " she said , over her fan . In the last two days she had not seen him at all . He had remained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out ; he left the cabin only to walk three times around the deck twice a day . Even Joshua had been drawn into that cabin Barney shared with Trumbull . " Well , it was a mite awkward , the situation , " Trumbull said , with true Yankee understatement . " He needed rest and food , too , " Douglass said thoughtfully . Trumbull eyed her . " So he did . " Douglass heard steps behind her ; she turned . " Why , here is Joshua , " she said . " Why do n't you come in ? " Trumbull patted the box under his arm . " I 'm off for a little sketching . I 'll say goodbye . " Douglass turned in time to see Joshua disappear into his own room . He was saying , " It 's hot as hell and there 's not a glass of beer in this damned town . I 'm going to change my shirt . " His door banged closed . Douglass called through it . " Why do n't you ever tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt and the door . " What do you mean ? " " You did n't tell me Trumbull and Jackson were going to sail with us ! " The door to the hall opened now , and Barney stood there . " He did n't , did he ? And has n't anyone told you not to shout ? " He leaned against the door jamb and regarded her . " Oh , " said Douglass . " Yes , they have . " " You know better , then ? Are n't you going to ask me to come in ? " " Yes , of course . " She smiled enchantingly . " You surprised me . And I do believe you 've gained another five pounds . " Barney shut the door and advanced into the room . He took her white hand and raised it to his lips . " Were you going out , Mrs. Harris ? " " My hat ? " She remembered her hat . " I was sitting outside , on the little balcony . Why , Captain ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're not detaining me . " " I did n't come to see you , though , Mrs. Harris . I came to see your brother-in-law , " Barney said . Douglass set her red mouth . " Wretch , " she said , and turned away from him . " I hate you , Barney , " she said , over her shoulder . She sank down on a chair and carefully arranged her skirts . Joshua opened his door and came into the room . " Captain Barney called to see you , Joshua , " she said , regarding both men as though they were far away . " So I see , " Joshua said . " It would be difficult not to be aware of Captain Barney 's presence , sister . " " I was wondering if you two would care for me to leave , " Douglass went on . Barney pretended to ponder this . " I guess not , " he said finally . Douglass swung her slipper . " We will manage to put up with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The English have no manners . " He grinned and sat down whereupon Barney did the same . " What did you find out , Harris ? " he asked Joshua . Joshua grimaced . " The Spanish have ordered the rudders of every American ship in port unhung until the damage to that Spanish vessel Gillon fired on is paid . " " Yes , I knew that , " Barney said . " Hill , of the Cicero , ' had offered  | me a lieutenant 's billet , for the passage home . Now he ca n't sail . " He continued , " I 'll come right to the point . Is your offer still open ? " " Yes , " said Joshua . Barney got to his feet and walked over to the doors that opened unto the balcony . Then he swung around . " At the time I refused you rudely . My reasons are now immaterial . " His smile flashed out . " But please accept my apologies for my discourtesy . " Joshua jumped to his feet , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it 's damned decent of you to say so first . You got ahead of me , Barney . " They were both silent for a minute , while Douglass watched them ; standing there , they were almost of the same height and build . She kept very quiet . Then Joshua said , " I did n't tell you . Since I 'm here , and can post my bond , and grease palms , we sail as scheduled . Tomorrow morning . The tide 's at seven . " " I 'll go aboard tonight , " Barney said . " Who 's my first officer ? " " Paul . Mr. Paul . I 'll go aboard with you , and introduce you . " Joshua smiled suddenly . " Jesus , Captain , the men will be  --  I ca n't think of the right word . And I 'll sail with you , aboard the ' Pomona . ' " Douglass could n't stand it any longer . " Joshua , " she said . He became aware of her again . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies , certainly . We 'll be carrying twenty guns , and we hope to use them . We shall convoy you ; you 'll be aboard a safe merchantman . " " I 'd like to take you aboard now , " Joshua said , forgetting Douglass again . " But I ca n't . I must go down to the port authorities and arrange everything finally . " " I 'll take you , " Barney said . " I 've a carriage out front Are you ready ? " Joshua nodded . Barney bowed to Douglass . " Goodbye , Mrs. Harris . Why do n't you go out and sit on the balcony ? " " I think I shall , since that was my intention , " Douglass said with hauteur . " I wo n't be back till suppertime , " Joshua said . " Barney , do you want some money ? " Douglass went out on the balcony . She heard Barney say , " I 'd like you to have one of your agents pay a debt of mine . Two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels . And you might advance me a hundred pounds . "  | The door closed then . The sums Barney spoke of so nonchalantly made her eyes widen ; below her they emerged into the street . Neither of them paid any attention to her ; they were talking , as though completely immersed . She looked after the carriage as it went off down the street . " Damn , " she said , quite inadequately . Ten minutes passed . She occupied herself in watching the people in the street below , the yelling urchins , the horsemen that clattered past . Then she saw a familiar carriage ; surely it was the one that Barney had hired . She almost rose ; then she remembered . She plied her fan , eyes downcast ; she threw glances down the street at the oncoming carriage . Then her eyes grew big and she put down the fan as she saw the carriage lurch over the curb and come dashing up right under the balcony . Hastily she plied the fan again as Barney stood up in the carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . " Would you like to come for a ride , Mrs. Harris ? " Everyone had stopped and was looking . Douglass said , " Oh , I would , Captain ! " Barney said , " Well , put your little backside on this railing . " Douglass stood up , hesitated a moment , and then sat on the railing . Barney scooped her up . Amid a flurry of skirts and petticoats she was deposited in the seat beside him . Still standing , he reached in his pocket and tossed a handful of coins to the delighted screaming urchins . While they scrambled for the coins , they shouted his name , and the sober Spaniards stared at this display of Yankee insanity . " La Pescaderia , " Barney called to the driver , and sat down beside her . The coach moved off with the calls of the urchins following it . Douglass was laughing and Barney , with a wide smile , put one arm around her , and captured her hand with his free one . " Hello , sweetheart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those big hats , but they interfere . " " It 's well something does . " She remembered the order he had called out . " And what is La Pescaderia ? " " The fishing village . It 's quaint . Look , my dear . To larboard . A twelfth century church . " Douglass obediently looked , turning her face to his , and he kissed the tip of her nose . She drew back . " Barney ! "  | He grinned . " Now look to starboard ; you can see over the harbor . " She could . The port of Corunna was closely built on the east side of a peninsula that sloped down into the bay . In the blue water she could see the small islands that dotted the bay and the protecting forts perched on them . The carriage rolled on downward , descending fast . It was an open carriage and along the way people shouted and waved at Barney . He said , as though to explain , " I sailed from Corunna all last Rummer and part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Last summer ? " She had told him before . It seemed such a short time ago . She glanced at his face ; last year at this time she had read in the newspapers : " Warning ! This is the rebel pirate Barney . " She looked at him uncertainly . Then she said , " Barney , I 'm afraid I ca n't give you permission to put your arm around me  --  in public . " The delivery and the sentence seemed to amuse Barney . " You ca n't give me permission ? " " No , Captain , " said Douglass . Then she smiled sweetly . " But I like you to hold my hand . " She looked down at the brown fingers around her white ones and at the heavy carved ring ; then her eyes lifted to his face again , a bit of question in them . " If you please . " Barney sighed . He removed his arm . " With deep regret , at your command , Mrs. Harris , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's La Pescaderia . " The coach was lurching merrily over a narrow section of the peninsula , blue water on each side . The fishing village clustered around the shore , the slender masts of its vessels rising higher than the little dwellings . Douglass was surprised when the driver suddenly stood up in the seat and yanked on the reins . The coach came to a flying stop and jerked . They had stopped in front of one of the houses next to the dirt road . A woman came running out , greeting Barney with a flood of smiles and quick Spanish . He answered , also speaking rapidly . She kept nodding . Then he dug in his pocket and brought out a roll of bills . He peeled off a pound note and handed it to her . Through her murmured " Gracias , senor , " he said to Douglass , " I 'm ordering fresh lobster , for the Captain 's table . We keep them alive for a good long time aboard . I always get lobster here . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglass answered , her eyes on another female figure who had come sauntering out of the house . She was barefooted and moved with feline grace toward the carriage ; she kept her wide brown eyes on Barney , and she came close and leaned on the carriage , her head almost against his arm . The woman spoke to her sharply . She did n't answer , but twisted her head sideways to look at Barney . He spoke then , his voice harsh and a scowl on his face , and she backed away ; the woman smiled and waved , and the carriage turned . " Now we 'll drive along the docks , " Barney said . " You had best take me back now , " Douglass said stiffly . Barney said , " What 's the matter ? Do n't you feel well ? " He reached for her hand again , and she pulled it away from him . " How did you dare ? " she burst out . " To take me there when you knew that girl would come out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both her hands in his . " So that 's it , " he muttered , turning her toward him , looking at her grimly as she made a last effort to loosen his grip . " Take me back ! " " I said we 're going to drive along the docks and we are . By God , you look at me ! " Defiantly she raised stormy eyes . Barney said , " There 's really no reason why I should tell you , but I 've never touched her , much less slept with her . Now sit back in the seat . " Douglass flushed . She could feel the telltale hot blood in her cheeks . She leaned back in the seat ; she was sitting very near him now . His shoulder pressed against hers , and he was holding both her hands . The carriage gave a lurch and turned . She heard him say : " There is the merchantman you sail on , Mrs. Harris . " She looked out over the water , not even seeing the ship . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Pretty thin , is n't she ? " Douglass found it with her eyes . The barque rode daintily at anchor , her painted green gunports closed , her masts rising slender and tall . Almost next to her rose a Swedish man-of-war of seventyfour guns . And out past this port would be British warships just as big ; next to them the " Pomona " would be a toy . Her fingers curled around Barney 's hand ; she held on tight . She said , very low , " Barney . " " What is it , my dear ? "  | He was looking out over the water to the " Pomona . " " I 'm sorry , " she whispered . He transferred his gaze to her ; he did n't say anything but he smiled a little . Douglass smiled back , tentatively . Then she said , with some speculation , " Lord , how angry you were with me ! " She was very thoughtful and Barney smiled openly and a bit ruefully . " You stir my pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best take you hack now . " Douglass could think of no appropriate answer to this . The carriage climbed the steep hill slowly . " You go aboard soon , I think , " Barney said . " And an old friend of mine , Captain Hill , is waiting to have supper with me . " " That will be nice , for you to see him again , " Douglass said . " Very nice , " said Barney , laughing . " And I sha n't see you again till the States . " She said , " But you will be near ! " " In case of storm I 'll come alongside and pick you up . " Douglass asked , " Will you , really ? " He laughed again . " I 'll promise to convoy you safely . " They had drawn up before the lodging house , and he got out and assisted her . " I 'll see you upstairs . " She walked alongside of him , up the steps . At the door he stopped . " Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain . " She looked up at him . " Barney , " she cried . " If they catch you , would they put you in the Tower ? " He took her hand , leaned down and brushed his lips against her fingers . Then he straightened . " They wo n't catch me , my dear , " he said . " Goodbye . " 11 " SAIL-HO ! SAIL-HO ! " The cry rang out from the lookout . Joshua Harris looked up from his writing . It was early afternoon . He flung down his pen and hurried out on deck . Barney was already fore . Glass tucked in his belt , he was swing-  | ing up the foremast shrouds , up over the futtock shrouds to the high masthead . Joshua waited anxiously . After a few long minutes Barney slid down onto the deck again , glass in hand , and joined Joshua on the quarterdeck . Joshua started to speak , but Barney had already raised his own voice . " We will keep on this course , Mr. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails . The " Pomona " was carrying full canvas , the breeze was fresh and strong , and she was running free before it . The stranger was off the stern quarter . Joshua said , his accent thicker than usual : " It is a pity , when we are so near the Delaware Capes ; I was hoping we 'd slip by . " Barney quoted , jibingly , " These are the times that try men 's souls , " and Joshua grinned ruefully . Joshua considered Thomas Paine a radical ; this was another of Barney 's good-natured jabs at Joshua 's conservatism . Barney was watching his convoy . There were four ships now , instead of the two he had started with . He had swung out of the normal route in the latitudes and taken a brig , loaded with fish and wines and brandies , and an English merchantman . Because of this , the crew of the " Pomona " had been reduced to ninety , or threefourths her normal complement . Joshua knew Barney had hoped to elude the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed his chin . The convoy were obediently scattering . Their maneuvers seemed to satisfy Barney , for he made no comment . Barney said , " I think she 's in the corvette class , Mr. Paul . " He raised a dark eyebrow , thrust his hands in his pockets , and said laconically to Paul : " Beat to quarters , Mr. Paul . " An hour passed . Joshua remained on deck . The other four ships had scattered ; the " Pomona " held her course . And the stranger was gaining . The gun ports had slid open , the brave new six-pounders served with powder and shot ; their gunners squatted before them , already grimed . The decks were sanded ; rifles had been issued ; hoses rigged . Barney was talking to the gunners , walking slowly along the line with Mr. Paul . Joshua turned to look at the other ship again . She was dead astern now . He thought Barney was right ; she was a corvette , with probably thirty-two guns . There was no question of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wind  | at her heels , which was what the British liked . Barney , looking preoccupied , joined Joshua again , brushing the powder off his hands onto his canvas trousers . A brace of pistols was jammed into his heavy belt . On the horizon , only dots showed the convoy . Barney had been studying the other ship through the glass . Silently he handed it to Joshua . Joshua raised it . Atop the mizzen the Union Jack was plain to see ; on the gaff fluttered the white ensign of the Royal Navy . Uniformed marines clung to her tops . Joshua said nothing as he handed the glass back to Barney . The officers were clustered around him . He began , " She 'll hail us in five minutes or so . " He was eying the water between the two ships . " When she hails , we will not waste words . We have only seconds to perform this very simple maneuver . We need one crippling hit to slow up her speed . We 'll try to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to judge if the corvette was in range . In seconds she would be . The ship 's bells struck in the silence ; five times they struck . At that moment a long hail came across the water . " What ship are you ? " The echoes had not died away before Barney had spoken . " Run up the colors , Mr. Paul . Helmsman , hard aport . " The " Pomona " yawed ship . She came about like a live thing . " Fire ! " cried Barney , eyes glued to the corvette . The " Pomona 's " ten starboard guns roared . The sound had not ( lied away when Barney said in the same tone : " Hands to braces ! Helmsman , keep her hard aport ! " She wheeled like a gull , leaning in the water , spray flying from her graceful bows , showing her heels now to the enemy . And she had made her hit . The corvette 's foretop sail had come tumbling down on her decks . Her guns had answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crew of the " Pomona " let out a yell of triumph now . It had happened so fast they hardly realized that they had been successful . They were still yelling and jeering as they drew away , faster now . Barney was saying to Paul : " We 'll wet down the sails a bit , Mr. Paul , and show her our heels as long as we can . You may send the hands to supper . We got a little taste of blood . " He turned to Joshua . " Time to eat , Harris . " Joshua said absently , " I suppose so . " Up overhead the flag flew . " But she 'll not give up the chase , " Barney was saying in between  | bites . The distant roar of a cannon bore him out . Joshua and the four officers ate quickly . But Barney seemed to be in no hurry . He drank his coffee at leisure ; he seemed to be deep in thought , paying no attention to what the others were saying . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck . He walked down the row of brass six-pounders . Then he disappeared fore . After about an hour , Joshua saw him emerge amidships and pick his way across the dark deck . Joshua waited for him to speak . There was no sound but the sound of water and wind ; the singing in the rigging . The moon was full . In its light there was no possibility of escape from the corvette , whose white sails could be seen in its radiance , even though they were dropping farther and farther behind . " I reckon it will be about midnight before she repairs that damage , " Barney said , thinking aloud . Joshua and Mr. Paul listened . There was a belch of fire from the corvette 's fore guns . A shot splashed into the water . " She 's showing her teeth , " Barney commented . " Are we going to answer ? " Joshua asked . Barney shook his head . He motioned with his thumb . " You forgot , Harris , to provide the Pomona ' with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he rubbed the sudden sweat off his forehead . He swore . " You were intent on her lines , no doubt , " Barney said , but his smile was genial . He knew how fast and with what awful difficulty ships were got out of the yards nowadays . Joshua said , " If she repairs that damage around midnight ? " He left the rest of the sentence unfinished , and Barney took it up . " Then she will hang around our stern and bang away with impunity all night . " " And she will discover we have no way of replying to their fire ! " " I fear she will , " said Barney thoughtfully . Then he smiled even more broadly . He was filling his pipe . " Now Mr. Paul , will you rout out Chips . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Paul started away . Barney 's voice stopped him . " I 'm not finished . I want a couple of axes . There 's an old three-pounder stored below . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in her counter . "  | Paul and Joshua were silent for a moment . Then Paul cried , " Good , sir , good ! " and dashed away . Joshua 's blue eyes sparkled . Then he remembered to reserve judgment . " Perhaps you can turn disadvantage into advantage ? " " Perhaps , " agreed Barney dryly . The boatswain appeared with two lanterns , then the ship 's carpenter , wide awake . Joshua wondered how many of the men off duty were asleep . The English guns took that moment to speak again . They were accompanied by the usual nearby splash . But no one paid any attention . Barney was puffing on his pipe and the sound of axes began to ring forth over the deck . At three the three-pounder was lugged into place . The splintered wood and leavings had been swept . Barney was bending over the gun , applying more oil to her rusty carriage , using a rag to wipe her off as tenderly as though she were a rare jewel he had found . The lanterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Paul suddenly spoke over Barney 's head . " Captain ! " he cried , almost despairingly . Barney did n't move . He was looking down the sights of the old gun . " Yes , Mr. Paul . " " Sir ! " Paul paused , and threw a look at Joshua . No one else was within hearing , save perhaps the helmsman . " We have no ammunition for a three-pounder ! " Barney was now squatting back on his heels . " No , we do not . " He stood up , and wiped the oil off his hands on the rag . In the light of the lantern , with the smell of the oil around him like a halo and a smear of it across his face , he smiled like a delighted satan , Joshua thought . And he said : " Now , Mr. Paul , I want fetched here a pair of crowbars , and a few stove lids , and grape shot . I 'm going below and shave . " Joshua went below and shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast now . The ship was alive after four hours respite . Joshua smelled coffee . He had cut his face twice shaving and was holding a handkerchief to his chin as he came into the after cabin . He drank a cup of scalding hot coffee and picked up a piece of bread . " How much more time ? " he asked Barney . " Not long till dawn , " Barney said . " Thirty minutes or so . " " You think you know what they 'll do ? " Barney nodded . " You can count on the English . They fight . No  | distant bombardment . They 'll be eager to get their teeth into us . Come along . " Joshua followed him out on deck . Joshua spoke to him as they emerged . " I , too , want to fight . " " What are you good at ? " Barney asked . " A rifle , " Joshua said modestly . " Tell the master-at-arms to issue you a rifle . " Barney was looking at the three-pounder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled the oddest and most ludicrous ammunition Joshua had ever seen . He wanted to give a shout of laughter , and Barney caught his eyes and they both grinned . " Nevertheless , those crowbars are mighty deadly , " Joshua announced soberly . He looked at them harder . " Christ Almighty , " he muttered , as he began to realize the amount of damage they could wreak , not only on human heads but on sails and rigging . The officers had been summoned ; the riflemen were already stationed in the foretops . Joshua , standing a bit aside , listened . The day was lightening . There was the faintest grey in the sky , and the lanterns had been extinguished . Barney 's low voice penetrated the quarterdeck . " I 'll fire this gun myself , " he said . " I expect , briefly , to do two things with this unexpected weapon . First , to create complete confusion among the boarders she will undoubtedly have massed fore . You can see she is going to hit us at what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope to cut away the fore shrouds and rigging . This will compel her to wear , to save her foremast from going by the board . When she wears , she will thus be in position for a raking broadside . " Suddenly he seemed to realize that the riflemen were already in the tops . He said , " Who the hell ordered those men aloft ? " Mr. Paul stammered . " I thought you said , sir ? " " I said , " Barney growled , " to assemble all available crewmen , issue rifles and send them aft . Get them down out of there ! " The men slid down onto the deck . The last one had no sooner hit the deck than the corvette 's fore guns roared . Low shots ploughed through the mizzen sails , bringing two spars hurtling down onto the deck . " What the hell were you doing , Mr. Paul ? Running a shooting gallery for the British ? " Barney watched as the wreckage was quickly cleared away . The dawn was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two ships rapidly now . In five minutes she would be on them . Her guns roared again , sending a section of the rail across the deck . The " Pomona " shook . " Now you may send the men aloft , Mr. Paul , " Barney said . Joshua 's hands were tight around the rifle . He began his climb . He could see now , plainly . All sails set , the corvette was dipping gracefully as she came toward her prey . As he climbed higher , Joshua saw the men massed on her forecastle ; men ready for boarding . Then Barney had been right . Joshua 's heart pounded . He swung over a yardarm and perched there . Twenty feet separated the two ships . There was not a sound aboard the " Pomona . " She fled on , before superior strength . But she could n't escape . Ten feet separated the two ships . In a minute the command aboard the Britisher to heave the grappling irons would come . Joshua could see them . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . There was a sudden shock as the two ships touched , prow to stern . At the same moment the most awful sound rent the air . The threepounder strained madly as she poured forth her ammunition . The crowbars flew into the massed men almost under her nose . Then whizzing grapeshot , murderous , poured into the massed boarders . Joshua calmly sighted down the barrel of his rifle at the face of a man only eighteen feet away whose eyes were bulging from surprise and fear . Joshua heard , as though far away ; the firing of the men around him as they poured lead into the men so near them . Barney had reloaded the gun ; it raked the enemy forecastle again , spitting death . Screams rose from the corvette 's forecastle . It was emptying fast , as the officers shouted vainly . The corvette 's jibs were hit ; they tangled and fell into wrecked spars and torn canvas . All the foresails and weather shrouds were cut away . Joshua brought down an officer 11 with his next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded men the orders aboard the corvette . As he was loading the rifle again , he remembered what Barney had said . The corvette was going to do just as he had said ; she was being compelled to wear to save the foremast . Joshua fired again . As he did he felt the " Pomona " shake with the explosion of her own guns , in a blazing broadside that caught the corvette full in her helpless position . The sound had not died away when Barney 's voice cut through . " Hard to starboard ! "  | The " Pomona " heeled . Viciously she was eager to come about . Her larboard guns raked the corvette with another full broadside . Frantically Joshua reloaded . He fired once more at the receding corvette . It was his last shot . The " Pomona " was pulling away fast from the scene of her victory , leaving behind her a crippled ship . For a moment Joshua sat there , on the yard , unable to believe it was over . He was sorry it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He looked at the corvette . Was she listing , or did he want to think she was ? He climbed down onto the deck . The crew were all yelling madly . They were cheering and dancing up and down . They had not lost a man ; they had hardly a scratch to show for the swift encounter . They were almost out of control . Barney let them go without reproval , as he stood there , his back to the three-pounder , his pistols in hand with smoke still curling from them . He waved them . The men yelled harder . Barney raised his voice . " A ration of grog to every man ! " There was another cheer and then , drawn by the magical lure of grog , the boatswain could get his men to listen . Joshua took a last look at the corvette . He realized it would be the height of folly to expose the " Pomona " to her heavy guns again . All that could possibly be done had been done . He walked toward Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say . Dimly on the horizon he could see the Delaware Capes . They were almost home . He heard Barney say : " You may lower the colors , Mr. Paul . " Joshua watched as the flag came slowly down . He watched as Mr. Paul handed the stars and stripes to Barney . He held out the rifle . " I guess I do n't need this any more , " he said . It was not easy to go back to being a merchant again .  | PART TWO 12 ABSOLOM JONES HEARD THE KNOCKS PLAINLY , SOFT THOUGH they were . He hurried to the door . It was an early hour , too early to r all . The man outside might be the bearer of an important message . It was therefore with surprise that he regarded the morning visitor . He stood for a moment , speechless , his dark face puzzled . He s ( ratched his woolly curls . " Bon jour , " said the visitor . Absolom blinked . " Yes ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The smile that accompanied this sentence changed suddenly into a sigh . She asked , " Should I come to that door ? " She pointed to the back panel . " Why , " began Absolom , and hesitated . She was wearing a very plain woolen cloak of some grey stuff . Beside her on the step rested a brassbound box . " You come to see the captain ? You know him ? " Her blue eyes looked into his with solemnity . " No , " she admitted . Then she blurted , " May I see him ? " Absolom swallowed . He leaned over and picked up the box . " Come in , " he muttered . He closed the door , and found himself alone with the stranger in the familiar hall . The big clock chimed right . " Wait here , please . " Under the wide staircase was a door that opened on a pair of curving steps . He had to bend his head to negotiate the turn . At the foot of the steps , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I told you to wait . " His voice had been low , but it had also been heard . Barney looked up from a plate of pink ham and omelette . He said lazily , " With whom are you having the whispered colloquy , Absolom ? " Absolom came down the last step . " What , sir ? "  | " Innocence ill becomes you , rascal . Who is behind you ? " At this , Absolom stepped aside . With some of the pride of a conjurer he permitted the sight of the morning visitor to come into Barney 's view . " But I told her to wait , Captain ! " " Well , " said Barney appreciatively . She made him a little curtsey . Her eyes in the heart-shaped face were appealing . Her cloak was still close around her , and her ungloved hands were clasped over a worn reticule . All this he noted instantly . He cut a piece of ham and chewed it thoughtfully . The fire hissed behind him as flames whipped at green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma'moiselle , " she corrected . " Lucie Magnin , sir . " His dark eyes rested on her appraisingly . " I do not know you , Lucie . " " No , Captain . " There was another silence in the small white-walled room . Behind it stretched the kitchens ; she could hear the activity out there , the clatter of pans , the clang on an iron stove door . Barney spoke to the Negro . " Absolom , you may bring me another cup of coffee . " He did not wait until Absolom had left the room . " Now , ma'moiselle , why are you here ? What do you want from me ? Speak up . " She hesitated . She was looking for the right word . " Work . " That was the right word , and she smiled , her dimples showing plainly . " Work . " She repeated it . Barney grinned . He looked at her eager face . " And what can you do ? " " Anything . " She nodded . " Truly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipe . " You should have gone to see Stephen Girard , " he said . " Master Girard takes an interest in French emigres . Where have you been staying ? You may speak your tongue , ma'moiselle . I shall understand you . " She answered quickly now . She said she had been staying at Denny 's lodging house in Water Street . " For the last ten nights , since the ship docked . " He was surprised . " Then you sailed in our convoy ? " " Oui ! " Again her smile flashed . " That is why I come to you . I knew your name . " " I see . " He sipped the coffee Absolom had brought . Tobacco smoke was filling the room . " But I ca n't employ you , you know . "  | He blew out another cloud of smoke , frowning a little . " Have you any money at all ? " " No . " " You came to the wrong man . This is entirely a male establishment . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sir . " She shook her head . " I should say the respectable acquaintances I have would hardly consider my word a recommendation , mistress . You 'd be badly armed with a note from me . If I sent you to Mrs. Rush , for instance , she 'd be sure I 'd tampered with your virtue . " He looked across to Absolom . " Would n't she , Absolom ? " Absolom grinned widely . " She might , sir . " Barney laughed outright . Then he asked , suddenly , " Are you equipped to do hair ? " He waved his hand , the big pipe in it . " Can you  --  take care of a lady ? " She eyed him . " Yes . " " I shall employ you . " He looked very pleased with himself . " Absolom , bring me pen and paper . I want to write a note . " He was thinking aloud . " I 'll employ you , and pay you for a year . Your mistress will be Madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Live with her ? " she echoed . She looked across at his bent head ; he was writing rapidly . Another Negro was clearing away plates ; Absolom was tending the fire ; they were doing this while her fate was being decided . And it was done so quickly ! " Here is the note . " Barney held it out to her . She did n't move toward him ; so he rose and walked the few feet between them . She felt the note between her fingers . " This establishment ? " she began . Barney interrupted . " A gold piece for each month . Twelve of them . And Absolom will take you . ' T is not far . " In two minutes exactly she was standing in the little court ; the bare bushes shook their branches at her . In her hand was the note and in her bag were twelve shining gold pieces . " This way , miss , " said Absolom . They turned in the opposite direction from which she had come . The alley was narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of Second Street , they turned left . Absolom carried her box on his shoulder . He nodded , spoke a good morning to John Sparhawk , apothecary and bookseller , whose  | shop was on the corner . He spoke to everyone , waving , and making bows to people passing in carriages . Lucie decided he knew almost everyone of the fifty thousand in the city . They passed a church , and a graveyard . Lucie crossed herself . It was n't right to have graveyards right in the center of the city , where people lived . It was very strange . They came to Second and High Streets . They turned right . Absolom said , " We go to Sixth and High . " Lucie was slowing her steps , and Absolom agreeably slowed his to match . Nevertheless , the moment of arriving at their destination was not much delayed . Lucie drew a deep breath as Absolom knocked . The door opened . " I have a note for ? " Lucie stopped . She could not find the right words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not understand his accent but she found herself in a small room to the left of a hall with a beautiful stairway . Her box was on the floor beside her , and she was waiting alone . Joshua came out of the dining room . He caught a momentary glimpse of a female figure as he went by the door . But he paid no attention , and went on . A ship was coming in that morning ; she had been sighted downriver yesterday . His chief clerk was probably down at the wharves and he should go himself . But for some reason which he himself could not fathom , Joshua Harris had , for the two weeks he had been home , varied between extreme irritability and good humor . This morning there was a scowl on his face . He stood uncertainly in the hall . Then he turned around and made off . When he passed the room at the left of the hall , he noticed the female was still there . Once more he swung around , and came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he snapped . Lucie had been standing at the window . She had kept her cloak on . The long minutes had passed much too slowly . The curt masculine voice made her whirl . She made him a quick curtsey . Then she answered his question . " No , sir , " she said . " I wait . " Joshua used his eyes to advantage . The girl was poor , she was French , she was lovely . And in some mysterious fashion , she was in his house . He came into the room . " For whom do you wait , ma'moiselle ? " He looked down into  | deep blue eyes . Great heavy auburn braids were wrapped like a coronet around her head . In her tiny pierced ears she wore oldfashioned gold earrings . " For me ? " " Non , m'sieur . " Her hands were clasped tight around the purse into which Barney had stuffed the money . She knew that gentlemen had the right to stare , but she dropped her own eyes . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " said Joshua , puzzled . " What is your name ? " " Lucie , sir . " She looked up at him again . " I wait for madame . She has had her tea , and she will presently descend . " " She will ? " Joshua smiled . " So it was related to me , sir , " Lucie said bravely . " I am going to serve her . It is contained in here . " She held up the letter . Then another thought occurred to her . " I am recompensed . " Joshua was completely bewildered . " Who recompensed you , Lucie ? " he asked . " Captain Barney , sir . " " Barney ? " repeated Joshua . Then he grinned . " God Almighty , I might have known . So he 's back ? " He turned . " I 'm sure madam will be down soon . " He went out into the hall . The butler was placing the mail on a salver . Joshua said , " Marston , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , said politely , " I 'm sorry , sir . Her ladyship has ordered the carriage for ten . " Joshua was already halfway up the stairs when this piece of information floated up to him . " Christ Almighty , " he muttered . Marston was speaking again . " Shall I inform the stabler you want a horse saddled , sir ? " Joshua shouted , " Yes , damn it ! " He continued up the stairs , and met Douglass at the top . She was carrying her cloak , masses of fur fell from it . She smelled of some perfume . Joshua regarded her for a moment . " You have a present , " he announced and laughed . " You look beautiful this morning , too , " he conceded . Douglass looked amazed . " Who else is beautiful , Joshua ? " " You 'll see , " he said . " And Barney sent her . " He heard Douglass ' steps quicken as she an down . Joshua then entered his own room . His man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Ten minutes later he entered Bladen 's court . The court ran off Elfreth 's Alley , near Second Street . Three houses faced onto its gardens . The middle one was Barney 's . Joshua  | stepped up the one low wide step and knocked on the white door . Absolom opened it . " Where 's the captain ? " Joshua asked , stepping into the square hall , and handing Absolom his scarlet lined cloak . " Will you come with me , sir ? " Absolom said . Joshua followed him upstairs . Through an open doorway he saw the back of Barney 's head as he lounged in a big chair in front of the blazing fire , his feet propped up on a stool . He untangled his long legs and stood up as Joshua came in . " When did you get back ? " Joshua asked , as he took the proffered hand in a hard grip . " Where the devil did you go ? " Barney grimaced . " Sit down , " he said , motioning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his foot he shoved over the stool so Joshua could share it . The walls of the room were lined halfway up with books . Over the fireplace hung a painting of the " Revenge , " with the white cliffs of Dover in the background . Joshua put his feet up on the stool . " This is nice , " he said . " The room . " " Yes , " said Barney . " I went as far down south as I could without getting snarled up with the British . No ships . " " No . I know it , " Joshua said . " So I was meditating . " Barney gestured to the bottle of rum and the glasses on the table between them . He asked , " Would you like to meditate a little ? " Joshua grinned . He poured himself a glass of the liquor and sipped it . " I wish I could give you the Pomona . ' But I 've a contract with her captain , and she sails tomorrow . Meantime I 've done all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships . " He shot a glance at Barney 's face . " Did you get our communication ? " He was pretty sure an explosion was coming . Barney heaved himself to his feet . " Yes , by God ! " He had planted his feet wide . Then , " I threw it in the fire . " He sobered a bit . " I wrote that . " He pointed to his desk and the open letter lying there . " May I see it ? " Joshua asked quietly . Barney picked it up and handed it to him . He began to pace , back and forth , back and forth , as Joshua had seen him do many times aboard ship . To Barney 's rhythmic strides he read . The letter was addressed to the Delegates of the Congress of the United States . It was short . " I most respectfully show : that I have served a year as a lieutenant of the Navy , during seven months of  | that time being a prisoner with the enemy ; that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty guns and am at present directed to take the rank of first lieutenant on board the Saratoga , a vessel of inferior force . That one year pay is due me for former services which in the present depreciated state of the currency is not worth my acceptance . That application has been made to the Board of Admiralty and no satisfaction can be obtained from that quarter . " Joshua looked up from the letter . Barney said , " You may throw that in the fire , too ! " " No , Barney , " Joshua said . " Send it . " He too rose , laid the letter on the desk and faced Barney . " In 1775 , you volunteered your services to the Navy , and sailed aboard the Hornet . ' You had no commission but served as first officer . Actually you commanded the vessel . When the captain refused to fight a vessel of superior force , you , already at one of the guns , threw a match stick at his head with such force it buried its iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled slightly . " The captain then remained housed in his cabin , no longer even assuming appearance of command . Because of the extreme gallantry of the actions of that ship , the incident was overlooked . And the captain was relieved of his command . There was even no court-martial . " " There should have been , " Barney growled . " I do n't condone my action . " Joshua smiled again . " You continued to serve aboard the ' Hornet , ' still with no commission . You raised the stars and stripes over her , the first time that Baltimore had seen the flag . You had the honor of receiving the first salute ever fired to that flag , at Stasia , in 1776 . Still , Barney , you had no commission . " He said strongly , " We need a Navy and we 've got to make Congress realize it ! " Barney said , " Are you suggesting I accept a commission  --  the one I 've been offered , aboard the Saratoga ' ? " " No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter ! " Barney said , " The Gillon incident ? " He broke off . " We tried to move Gillon out . We could n't . Too much influence . Now we are working on a single head for the Navy . Agent of Marine , Lord of Admiralty , Secretary of the Navy , call it what you will . But we want Morris . Send the letter . We 'll have it published in the papers . " " I think I 'll get drunk , " Barney said . He sat down again , put his  | feet up . Then his good humor asserted itself . " Let 's meditate . How is it with you since we landed ? " Joshua swallowed off the glass of rum . He twirled the glass in his fingers . " My erstwhile bachelor establishment is fouled up with females , for at least one of which I have you to blame . The household bills have doubled ; seamstresses go in and out , and my butler , whom my father brought from England thirty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter in the house . " " Meditate some more , " Barney said consolingly . " And now this latest female , " Joshua said , turning to pour some more rum and to look at Barney . " Where did you get her ? " " She sailed with us . " " Is that all you know about her ? " Barney considered . " She 's damned pretty . " Then he grinned wickedly . " If you attempt to seduce her you 'll probably get your skull crushed . I can imagine the look you 'll get from Douglass if you so much as mention her name . " Joshua also considered . " She 's damned pretty , " he agreed . " About the ship , Barney . The State of Pennsylvania will give you command of its made-over merchantman  --  they 've pierced her for assorted guns , anything they could get hold of , and these damn refugee boats cruise around in the rivers off the Delaware , and often help the blockading British , acting as escort boats , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seriously , " that it might be a temporary measure . " Such a profound silence followed this remark that Joshua said suddenly , " Things are rather grim . " Barney poured some rum and drank it . Joshua said , " It 's the fifth year of the war . People are discouraged , Barney . What 's making it worse is the financial situation . Washington has barely enough money to keep up the secret service , even though he does spend a good deal on it . Congress does n't help matters when it issues worthless amounts of printed money . " Barney asked , " What do you do about that money ? " " What can we do ? Ignore it . We ca n't use it . We do business as though it does n't exist . That means our personal word , or bond , or barter , or British pounds . As a matter of fact , the people are n't using it either . You ca n't pay them with it . My barber has papered his shop with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the big reasons Stasia is invaluable to us. "  | " Stasia , the Caribbean and the sea war . They 're the important things . What I need is a frigate . " " The USS Frigate , 32 , " said Joshua . " When you want something , sir , you ask yourself who 's got it . " " Yes , " said Joshua . " So who has the ships ? " " The British , " said Joshua . " Yes , " murmured Barney . Joshua looked over at him . For a moment Joshua had a wonderful wild dream in which he and Barney stole into New York and made off with a British frigate . Then he sobered . Barney was filling t heir glasses again with an abstracted expression on his face . He said : " I 'm not the man for temporary expedients . " " A tangent in roughly the right direction is sometimes the only course . " " I prefer a straight and a.true course . " Joshua said , " But how ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney 's dark face . He wondered vaguely if he had drunk more than he thought he had . Barney caught the look . " The hell with it , " he said . " Let 's go to the theatre tonight and take your beautiful sister-in-law . " 13 JOSHUA REGARDED THE TIPS OF HIS BOOTS WITH SOME SURPRISE . He was still wearing the things . He stretched his legs out . Then he leaned over and took off the heavy boots . He stood slowly , yawning . He must have fallen asleep after dinner . He had not gone down to the docks as he should have , to have dinner with the captain of the ship that had just come in , and he suddenly remembered he was going to the theatre . He yawned again ; the clock struck the quarter hour . Boots in hand , he started for the hall and the stairway . At the same minute Lucie came flying down the steps in a whirl of haste and petticoats . Since Joshua had approached the bottom step from the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurtled into him . " Uh , " grunted Joshua , catching her with one arm and the newel post with the other . The boots clattered to the floor .  | Lucie gasped in dismay . " Mille pardons ! " She looked up at him shyly . She was gathered close in his arms . She breathed : " Did I wound you , m'sieur ? " " Not mortally , " Joshua said , releasing her and the newel post . She stepped back hastily to allow him to go on upstairs , and stepped on his boot . Joshua caught her again . " My god , girl , " he said , both arms around her . " Ca n't you stand upright for more than a minute ? " Once more he set her on her feet . " ' T was your footgear , " she said , abashed at her clumsiness . She bent hastily and picked up the boots ; she held them out . " Allow me , sir . " " Thank you , Lucie , " Joshua said absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was her figure . This morning she had had her cloak on . Now the tiny white lace apron she wore accentuated her small waist . Joshua did not move and his presence held her prisoner for he blocked her way while his gaze traveled slowly down to her feet and up to her face again . " Madame helped me fashion this dress , m'sieur , " she said breathlessly . " She did , Lucie ? " Her eyes questioned him . " You do not approve , m'sieur ? " " I approve , " he said , putting his free hand under her chin and tipping her face up . He looked into eyes shadowed by curling lashes . Then he dropped his hand . Douglass was coming down the stairway . Joshua said : " Fetch me a pair of shoes , will you , Lucie ? And take these boots up for me . " He felt her fingers on his as she reached for the boots . She asked , as she moved away , " But which shoes , m'sieur ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partridge . " " Oui , m'sieur . " She started upstairs and Joshua watched her go . Her ankles were good . Into this thought Douglass ' voice came . " I 'd like a word with you , Joshua . " She passed by him and went on into the drawing room . Joshua followed her into the room he had just left . He went over to the fire and stood with his back to it . Douglass put her black velvet cloak down on a chair . Her gown was black and a froth of lace fell over her white shoulders and arms . " Very nice , sister , " Joshua said . " Thank you , Joshua , " Douglass replied , eying first his stocking  | feet and then slowly raising her eyes to his face . He was looking back at her , one eyebrow lifted . " Did you wish to speak with me ? " he asked . Douglass thought of the scene she had just witnessed . " I want to ? " She stopped . His blue eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Douglass spoke fast . " Lucie came here to meet her brother . " The words tumbled out . " It had been six months since he had last written her . She finally obtained passage , and when she arrived ten days ago her brother had gone . She went to Mrs. Denny 's , on Water Street , where he had been living . Mrs. Denny told her that her brother had despaired of her coming and had joined the army ! " " Well ? " said Joshua . " I just wanted you to know , Joshua . " She hesitated . " She is very unworldly , having spent the last three years in a convent . She is seventeen , she ? " " Here is Barney , " Joshua said . " And for your information , sister , I 'm old enough to judge the innocence or worldliness of a woman . " Douglass turned . Marston had taken Barney 's hat and cloak , and he was coming toward her . She extended her hand . " We were talking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you know she had been in a convent ? " " No , madam , " Barney said . Standing over her , he was looking down at the shining waves of blonde hair and the curve of her white shoulder half concealed by the black lace . " Could n't you tell by her English that she had been educated ? " " I never thought about her English . " Joshua broke in . " Indeed , sister , it is you who have been spared some blunt English from me , because of Captain Barney 's timely arrival . " He swung around and then decided to see if Lucie had returned yet with his shoes . He looked out into the hall ; she was coming down the stairway , shoes in hand . Joshua took them , thanked her and sat down . " Would you care for something to drink before we go ? " he asked Barney . " No , thank you , " Barney said . He was amused . Douglass had risen and was standing , looking from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt you deserved the reproof , English , " he said . " How do you like it here ? " " In the colonies ? " asked Douglass . Joshua looked up from his shoes ; he met Barney 's eyes . Barney  | bowed to Douglass . " Touche , my dear . But would you answer my question ? " Douglass flipped her fan open , and looked over it . " I find a very tolerable French influence everywhere , gentlemen . Also I must confess surprise . I rather expected to hear much talk of politics , and such like ; instead the gentlemen of the city here are divided into two opposite camps  --  over the rival merits of two French hair-dressers ! " Joshua had finished with his shoes . He stood . Once more Douglass looked from one to the other . " And , sirs , I was told I should have to conform , whereas both of you do exactly as you please ! Yes , and so does Miss Goodenough next door . Being a Quaker , she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ! " Joshua said , " There is a vast difference between you and Miss Goodenough , aside from her intellectual achievements . " Douglass drew a deep breath . Joshua went on , " Miss Goodenough is seventy-seven . Are you ready to go , sister ? " " I believe so , " Douglass said haughtily . " Lucie ! " Lucie had been standing in the hall waiting . She could not have helped hearing Joshua . As he came out into the hallway she was hardly reassured by the quick look she received ; her hands clasped tight over Douglass ' bag . Douglass came out in the hall with Barney and the four of them stood there while Joshua asked : " Was it your intention that Lucie attend you at the theatre , sis-ter ? " " Yes , " Douglass said , handing Lucie her fan , which Lucie put into the bag . " It is hardly necessary , sister . Not usual . " Then Joshua looked at both of them . The candlelight in the wall sconces gleamed on Lucie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue they were almost violet , were fastened on his in appeal . Joshua caught Barney 's eye and Barney threw up his hands helplessly . He laughed . " Damned if I know who won this encounter , sir , " he said , as they went out the big doors with Lucie coming behind . She had never been in a theatre before . She climbed up front with the driver . Barney handed Douglass into the carriage he had waiting . " Careful of your brittle bones , Miss Goodenough , " he said . It was a few minutes after six when they arrived at the theatre , so  | the first skit was being presented . Douglass sat between Barney and Joshua , and Lucie sat just behind in the box , after she had carefully put madam 's cloak and muff on another chair . By this time they had succeeded in getting the attention of most of the audience so that when the curtains swung closed , Lucie became aware that everybody was looking in their direction . The theatre got noisier than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on or what the actors were saying . Barney 's name was being called out loudly . Then the curtains opened again . A man came striding out on the stage and almost up to their box ; he bowed to Barney and a very pretty girl ran out and curtsied to him . They waved their hands for silence , and the audience , sensing something , actually became fairly quiet . The skit began . The actor began to confide to the men about his wife . Lucie did n't understand half of what he said , but she saw Joshua smile with real amusement . She kept her eyes on Joshua , who was sitting almost sideways to her . Then the man on the stage finally broke off his harangue and started to sing . He kept gesturing to the pretty girl . " Judy leads me such a life , The devil never had such a wife . How can I sing a funny song ; She 's mocking me all day long , what can the matter be ? " It was a catchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sang it . " What can the matter be ? " She saw he was leaving the center of the stage and coming right over to their box . He smiled and sang : " Barney , leave the girls alone , Why do n't you leave the girls alone , And let them quiet be ? " The audience stamped and yelled . Lucie caught the general enthusiasm and wanted to stamp and shout too . In the midst of this Barney got to his feet and bowed . As he sat down again the girl came over to the box . She was giving orders in song to her husband . " Put the muffins down to roast , Blow the fire ! Make the toast ! We 'll have tea ! "  | Then she turned to Barney . She sang : " Barney , you 're a wicked boy , And you do always play and toy With all the gals you see . Why do n't you leave the girls alone ? " Barney grinned . She was singing right to him , very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold piece ; he tossed it to her and she caught it in her skirt , revealing slim silk-stockinged legs . The audience shouted approval . " Do it again , Barney ! " Douglass held her handkerchief daintily to her nose . Barney fished out another handful of coins and started to pitch them , deliberately tossing them high . The crowd yelled louder , and finally Barney spread his hands to show they were empty . " You 'll beggar me , lads . " He waved his hands and spoke to the girl . " Give them a free show , Judy ! " She pirouetted and her skirts went high . " Little bitch , " Douglass said under her breath . Aloud she said , " My fan , Lucie . " Startled , Lucie found her voice . " Oui , madame . " She handed Douglass the fan , and armed with it , Douglass remarked : " Judy 's knock-kneed , I do believe . " Barney laughed . He said over Douglass ' head to Joshua , " I forgot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would you like us to leave ? " Douglass inquired haughtily . Barney said , " Why , no . We can return later . " Joshua heard this and dissolved into laughter . The audience had now joined in the chorus . Barney leaned close to Douglass . " Are you knock-kneed ? " Douglass snapped her fan to and raised it . " No ! " she said . Barney grinned and settled back in his chair . " An important issue resolved , " he murmured . Douglass opened the fan again and regarded him thoughtfully over it ; the curtains had closed ; the skit was over . She smiled at Barney . " It was fun , " she said . But she was very quiet and thoughtful as the play went on . She heard practically nothing of it . She used her fan slowly , her eyes on the stage , on Barney . She saw Joshua shift in his chair and look sideways at Lucie , look at her long . She did n't dare interfere more than she had done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | tioned Lucie to him . Damn him , she thought , he 's such a handsome devil ; she bit her lip and remembered the words of the song . She would like to comb his head with a three-legged stool , and quite unaware Joshua turned his attention back to the stage again . Barney seemed to be engrossed in the play . She thought that probably he always gave whole-hearted enthusiasm to whatever he was doing . She was content to sit there beside him , just knowing he was there , and to catch his eye once in a while and to smile . But  --  she suddenly told herself to stop speculating ; she remembered vividly , as though it were being enacted , the first time she had ever seen him , standing there in the dusty prison yard . On the way home she listened to Barney tell Joshua that Humphreys and the privateer " Black Prince " had come in this afternoon , shot up a bit . " She was lucky to have escaped ; she ran up Wilmington creek . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have dined aboard the Triton , ' " Douglass said idly . A gust of wind shook the coach . " Sou'easter blowing up , " Barney said . Rain sounded on the windows , hard , as the carriage stopped . They ran into the house . " I must say Philadelphia weather is as bad as ours , " Douglass said , breathless . Lucie took her cloak . " Did you like it , Lucie ? " Douglass asked . Lucie nodded , eyes shining . " Oui , madame ! " A vivid smile lighted her face ; it was so lovely a smile Douglass glanced at Joshua . He actually looked a little bemused ; then he said , " Excuse me please a moment . " He started upstairs . Douglass turned to Barney . " Wo n't you stay for supper ? " He had followed her into the long drawing room ; he looked around appreciatively . " I wish I could , " he answered . Once more she felt her assurance leave her , when they were thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , moving away from him toward the fire . " You always leave me , Captain , " she said suddenly , surprising herself with the words . But he understood . He frowned slightly , and , looked at her . " Yes , " he said . " I 'm a sailor . " He walked over and touched the ivory keys of the clavichord . " I 've always wanted to be able to play one of these . Do you play ? " " Yes , Barney , " she said , low . He looked up from the keys . " I bought a parcel of land today . On the river , up a few miles . I have plenty of money again . " He smiled  | a little . " The prizes were valuable . I want to build a house there ; a house like this . " " You wo n't be able to enjoy it much , " Douglass said . " Will you ? " " No . But I come home . " She said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will you do ? " He shrugged . " I 've been seriously considering either returning to France , or else joining Marion and his guerillas in the South . One or the other . " " You would n't stay here ? " She put her hands out to him , in an appealing gesture . " No , madam . " The negative was firm and absolute . A bit of the gay tune she had heard tonight came back to her . " Barney , leave the girls alone , and let them quiet be . " He was coming toward her and she turned away from him . He took her by the shoulders . " Is this a propitious time to ask you to drive out with me tomorrow afternoon ? " " No , sir , " said Douglass . " I must take tea with Miss Goodenough tomorrow . Wo n't you join us ? " She laughed at the expression on his face . " I hate tea , English . " " It will be four shilling schou-schong tea , Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a delightful renegade . " Barney sighed . " We 'll have whiskey for you , " Douglass said . " I surrender , " Barney muttered . His fingers closed around her wrist . Douglass turned away from him . Before she could move away she felt his hands grasp her shoulders . He stood behind her . " Let me go , Barney , " she said . " No . " He leaned down and kissed the white skin at the base of her neck . He spoke in her ear . " I 've made a hell of a concession , having tea tomorrow . " Douglass whispered , " You are n't going to drink any . " " No . Now I 'm asking you for something . " His hands were strong on her shoulders . " You 're not asking , " Douglass said . He swung her around to face him . His arms closed around her . He had tipped her head back over his arm , and she looked up at his face through her thick lashes.  | He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wench . All I want is a goodnight kiss . Remove your hands from the front of my coat . " " Barney . " She said his name very low . She placed her hands gingerly on his wide shoulders . " Why are you so afraid of me , Douglass ? " He locked her in a close embrace . For just a moment he looked down at her face and then his mouth closed over hers . The kiss was long . Finally he released her lips . " How was that ? " he whispered . His mouth was only an inch from hers . " Damned expert , " she whispered back . He grinned . She turned her head and he kissed the base of her throat . " Will you dream of me a little ? " " I 'll try not to , " said Douglass . " Anyway , I 'll enjoy my tea better tomorrow . " She laughed . " I will , too , Barney . " She caught her breath and her lashes fell . He set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his , and they went into the hall together , side by side . Even when Marston put Barney 's cloak over his shoulders Barney kept hold of her hand . He stood looking down at her . " As I said before , madam ? " He smiled down at her suddenly . " What , Barney ? " she asked . " There 's a bad sou'easter blowing up . " He kissed her hand . " Goodnight , Madam Harris . " 14 LUCIE WAKENED IN THE GREY DAWN . SHE SAT UP IN BED ; SHE heard footsteps . They were receding and she realized quickly that what she heard was the cook , Mrs. Simpson , going downstairs . Lucie got out of bed . Her white cotton nightgown was long and full and ruffled around her wrists . The heavy auburn braids reached her waist . She went over to the window and looked out . From her one window , she could see down into the kitchen garden ; the earth looked wet , brown and soggy . From here she could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small orchard and the roof and chimney of the jutting kitchens . The smoke from the chimney rose straight up . The branches of the trees were stiff and unmoving . And the storm which had beat down last night was over . Lucie knelt by her bed and said her morning prayer . She poured water in her basin and washed . Then she dressed hastily . She brushed her hair and coiled the great braids around her head . She made her bed . Then , carrying the used water , she made her silent way through the quiet house . In the raftered kitchens , Mrs. Simpson was stirring cornbread in a huge bowl with a wooden spoon . Her helper had already put the draft on the fires in the stove . The kettle was beginning to sing ; the coffee was beginning to bubble . Mrs. Simpson handed Lucie three eggshells . " Drop them in the pot , Lucie , " she said , and smiled . Lucie obeyed . " It 's a warm day , " said the boy , her helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " John , " he said . He picked up the poker and started to shake the grate . " That do n't need doing , " Mrs. Simpson said . " You can go and fetch the cream . And bring me two slices of ham from the smokehouse . " She handed him a shining knife , and he disappeared , after a last look at Lucie . The warm morning air floated into the kitchen when he opened and closed the door . " The day will be splendid , " Lucie said , hardly getting the words out before they both heard the hammering noise in the distance . Mrs. Simpson stopped beating the cornbread and held her head on one side like a bird to listen . " That 'll be the front door ! " She waved the spoon at Lucie . Lucie jumped to her feet and ran . She struggled with the bolts as the pounding on the heavy oak continued from outside . When the last bolt slipped free , the door was caught by rude hands and flung open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell Mr. Harris , " he said , " that a British frigate is aground up the Delaware other side of Chester ! " He swung up into the saddle , plying his whip before he got his other foot in the stirrup . " Ran aground in the storm , " he shouted . " She 's the ' Triton ' ! " He disappeared down High Street in a whirl of flying hoofs.  | Lucie slammed the door shut , not bothering to lock it . She ran back through the hall and up the wide stairway . She knew which room was Mr. Joshua 's . She had peeked into it yesterday . But when her flying steps carried her right to it , and the closed door faced her , her fingers dropped from the knob . She knocked gently instead . Within the room Joshua was sleeping soundly . Lucie knocked again , louder , and there was no answer . She opened the door and an over to the big bed . Joshua was lying flat on his stomach . His face was turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his tousled , short , clipped curly hair . " Mr. Harris , " she said . Joshua rolled over and opened his eyes . He opened his eyes wider . Lucie said hastily : " A man came . He said to tell you there is a British frigate around in the Delaware ! " Joshua sat up . " What ? " Lucie remembered . " Non ! " she cried again . " Aground . Aground in the Delaware ! " " Jesus God , " muttered Joshua . He leaped out of bed and started to get dressed . Lucie fled . In less than two minutes he came into the kitchen , carrying his shirt and coat and a pair of boots . He dropped all three on the floor . " Water , " he said . " Boy , run and saddle a horse . " John disappeared again . Lucie seized the kettle and half filled a basin . She mixed it with cold . While Joshua splashed and water flew in all directions the cook fetched a towel . Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt . " That lazy bastard , Partridge , " he muttered through his shirt . He sat down to pull on his boots . " Lucie , get me my rifle . The third one on the rack . " Once more Lucie ran . She knew the gun room was right behind the hall . She had learned that this collection of firearms was his pride and joy . She seized the third weapon on the rack of rifles and ran back to the kitchen . He was standing at the open door , booted , while the boy led his horse . Lucie thrust the rifle at him barrel first . " Votre arme de feu ! " Joshua grinned . He slung the weapon under his arm and gave her a swift pat on the backside . " Thank you , " he said . He gained the  | saddle , and the boy ran to open the gate . The cook joined Lucie on the back porch to watch . Lucie said : " Mon Dieu , he rides magnificent ! " Mrs. Simpson wiped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia , " she said . Joshua galloped in headlong haste straight down High Street the seven blocks to the river . At Second he had checked his horse for a moment , but then he was sure that Barney would be down at the wharf already . At the top of the steep hill that dropped down to the river 's edge and the High Street wharves , he dismounted ; the cobblestones were still wet . Halfway down he hitched his horse in front of a tavern and plunged through the melee of men already gathered and filling the wide street . The State of Pennsylvania maintained a small fleet of thirteen rowgalleys for the defense of the Delaware . The largest of these was the brig " Montgomery , " boasting twenty guns , manned by volunteers . Joshua was the marine officer of the " Montgomery . " He saw that she was already warped up to the wharf . Then he saw Barney . Barney was standing with Captain Read , of the " Montgomery , " and Captain Humphreys , of the privateer the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had the right to wear . In his belt was the pair of boarding pistols that heralded action . Joshua slowed his pace as he approached them , to appear leisurely . " Good morning , gentlemen , " he said . He heard the two other men answer him but his eyes swept them briefly before his blue ones met Barney 's dark eyes . Barney said : " The Triton , ' 32 . " " I believe , " Joshua said casually , " that like Pallas Athena , she sprang full panoplied from the front of your head . " Barney grinned ; the other two men look bewildered . Humphreys said : " I was just telling Barney I wished I could take the Prince ' downriver . But there 's not the smell of a breeze . She was becalmed since yesterday ! " " Where is she ? " asked Joshua . " Past Chester , " Barney said . " She ran aground during the storm ; evidently she was escorted upriver by those refugee boats  --  you were speaking of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled a little . Joshua said , " Why do n't you join us aboard the Montgomery ' ? " Read interposed . " We have our full complement , Captain . "  | " My compliments to Captain Read , " Barney said . " But I 'm going downriver in a ship 's boat , kindly provided by Humphreys , here . Goodbye sir . " This last was to Joshua , and Joshua murmured , " Goodbye , " reluctantly . He watched Barney walk away . A longboat was waiting at the dock for him . The men in it were bandannaed ; they looked a cutthroat lot . Humphreys whispered to Joshua : " The worst rascals in my crew , but he asked for them . " Joshua waved to him as he followed Read aboard the " Montgomery . " In midchannel Barney 's boat was pulling away swiftly with the still outgoing tide . The " Montgomery 's " anchors were weighed . There was , as lumphreys had said , no smell of a breeze . Therefore the oars flashed and dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on the arms chest aft , his rifle across his knees . The tide was still ebbing , very slowly now . It was a small aid , though , and Joshua reckoned any aid was welcome . Joshua reckoned that they had until noon at the very latest before the incoming tide would lift the " Triton " off the mudbank and let her sail unscathed to freedom . Joshua watched the other twelve rowvessels as they ploughed along through the silver waters of the river . It looked better than it smelled , for the muddy banks stank foully . He was conscious of the smell ; he was conscious of an immense disappointment , for he knew now how much he had hoped that Barney would come with them . Barney 's boat was still dead ahead , so close Joshua could see the brawny scarred and tattooed arms of the men who pulled at her oars . In sudden impatience , Joshua got to his feet and started to pace back and forth on the narrow deck . His marines were clinging in the rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he would use , sat there like a reproach . They were passing Barney 's boat now ; Joshua went to the side and waved . He got a glimpse of swarthy faces , gold earrings and shining cutlasses . Barney waved a cutlass at him , and drew his finger across the blade . Joshua left the rail and went back to the arms chest . They were leaving the city behind . Read was bustling about importantly . " Of course we should row down , " he said to Joshua and the first officer . " But we must remember she 's a frigate . " Joshua said , " Yes . " " It looks as though everyone in the city will be there , " Read continued . The road along the river was already crowded . Horsemen  | galloped along , coaches lurched , and wagons struggled through the mud engendered by last night 's rains . " Everyone wants to see the British stuck on a mudbank , " Joshua commented , his mind far from his words . He was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its root . He said aloud , " If we could ? " He broke off , and once again jumped to his feet . The men bent to the oars . They flashed and dipped . Still there was no wind . The improvised crew were laughing and talking , lounging on the deck , climbing aloft to see what they could see and waving to the people on the roads . A couple of them had stretched out on deck , to pass the time in snoring . After a couple of miles Joshua could contain himself no longer . He said to Read , " Should n't you give the men at the oars a rest ? Get fresh blood , so to speak ? " Read looked surprised . " When the time comes , sir , " he said , sharply . But in a few moments he relayed the order to the first officer . One of the sleeping men untangled himself and went to relieve an oarsman . Joshua paced back and forth . The next curve of the river should reveal Chester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their landing docks were empty of craft , and Joshua knew they were already on the scene . The men bent to the oars . They pulled past the city , its shipyards , its docks . One of the men kicked a sleeping figure sprawled on the deck . " Get up , you lazy bastard , and you might see something , " he was told . There was activity now on the brig . Its guns were out and loaded , with shouted orders from Read . His voice annoyed Joshua . He told himself that after having sailed with Barney he was damned spoiled . There were n't many men like him in the Navy . He did n't know what Barney could do with a longboat and twenty potential murderers , but he could do something . If he were in command of the brig he could and would do something . The " Montgomery " had at least maintained its lead dead ahead of the other smaller craft . Astern came the other twelve galleys , slim , rakish , a little fleet of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lookout . " Sail-ho ! " This electrified all the rowgalleys since the cry had echoed out over the river . They seemed to pull harder and gather speed . The  | curve of the river came nearer and nearer , and then Joshua saw the " Triton . " Joshua jumped up on the arms chest to see better . He swore . There she was , all right . She was no mirage  --  the " Triton , " 32 . Joshua 's experienced eyes told him she was not only lovely but fast . Three great masts towered over her upward , courses , tops , royals furled . The stiff set of the standing rigging and the slack curves of the running rigging made a picture against the pinking skies . Her crew would be upward of three hundred men . She was single decked , built for cruising , for spying out the enemy , for quick capture . Ensnared with mud , she listed . Her runout starboard guns pointed slanted up ; the larboard guns stuck their muzzles listlessly down toward the river 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecastle and aft long nines bristled . Now the incoming tide had swung her around about ; she presented her stern to the oncoming rowgalleys ; her rakish bow held fast in the mud . The " Triton , " 32 . Joshua felt his excitement rise . His mind whirled with plans . If they could capture her , could he finance her for privateering ? If he and Barney threw in together all the money from the recent prizes , and ? He broke off his calculations sharply . He had instead a picture of Barney standing on that quarterdeck with the stars and stripes on her gaff ; into this came Douglass ' cool voice : " I 've dined aboard the Triton . ' " British oak , copper bottomed , fitted with brass guns , gleaming ; in Barney 's hands she would be quick deadly menace ! The reality of her was upon them . Uniformed figures moved on her decks . Loud voices and jeers went from ship to shore , and ashore there were crowds of people . Across the rolling fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells of the little country churches , ringing , tolling out their warnings . The British are here . Coaches and wagons of every description were on the scene , fires had been built ; hawkers were selling coffee and hot chocolate and lemonade . Flags waved gaily . On the river the thirteen rowgalleys began to slow their oars ; and over this merry scene the sound of gunfire was almost startling . The " Triton , " incensed and harried by these paltry vessels , shook with the recoil of her stern cannon . Joshua knew they were beyond the range , but these were the guns which would keep the frail galleys at their distance . Nevertheless , Read roared out an order to fire .  | He wasted ammunition . The British jeered loudly , the cries plain to hear . " Come no further , Yankees , " yelled a topman perched high in the " Triton 's " rigging . " You might get hurt . " Read was standing next to Joshua . The " Triton 's " guns were indeed formidable . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased their rowing , and spread out a little . Then began a sort of serenade , military in sound but not in action . The rowgalleys were not close enough to have their shots do anything but fall helplessly into the water . Every once in a while the " Triton " would answer their shots with a sullen roar of disgust as her stern cannon belched fire . The British kept up their jeering . They did n't like being stuck on a mudbank ; what had been deemed a daring maneuver was funny , and to allay their discomfiture they hurled verbal insults . Their officers did n't try to quiet them . The Americans shouted back ; for a while they contented themselves with rude language for the British ; then they turned eyes on their compatriots . The rowgalley , the " Montgomery " in the van , danced out of range . Five hundred men were held helpless on the rest of the galleys . Suddenly a loud voice addressed the " Montgomery . " " Scared of guns , lads ? " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British , the Americans , outdid each other in calling names at the rowgalleys . After Joshua had been dubbed a number of cowardly bastards for ten minutes he stood it no longer . His accent was very thick as he finally spoke to Read . " This is nonsense ! " His blue eyes were cold with contempt and Read stepped back from him . Read looked from one to the other of the faces of his officers . " What would you suggest , sirs ? " he asked . " I 'd suggest either we attack , or go home , " Joshua said grimly . Read looked around at the ship Joshua suggested they attack . Once more he reminded himself with his own eyes of her size . He turned back to his officers . The ship was silent ; the jeers sounded louder than ever ; the volunteer marines , the men at the oars all were silent , looking toward the knot of officers on the quarterdeck . " My dear sirs , " Read was saying . Joshua 's jaw set ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail . He raised his voice . " Lads , " he said . They looked back at him , some of the oarsmen half rising to their  | feet , hands still on the heavy wood , when suddenly Joshua saw Barney and the longboat . Almost as if the " Triton " realized Barney 's presence , her stern guns fired . The sound died away , the smoke curled up slowly , and Barney 's voice cut through in a crisp command : " Back starboard ! " The longboat was coming alongside the " Montgomery . " Barney was standing in the stern . " Bow ! " he said . Then , " Way enough ! " The oars dipped once more . " Stand by to toss ! Toss ! " The crisp orders , the immediate obedience , the sight of the boat , its oars vertical now , as it came alongside , handled so well , were immediate reassurance . Barney grasped the ladder and swung aboard , landing on the deck like a cat . He looked around lazily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like a little fighting today ? " I He grinned , and pulled one pistol from his belt . He cocked it and snapped back the lever holding the layment ; the dagger-like blade flipped forward . " Who would like a pocketful of prize money to spend tonight ? " They said his name , they answered him in low voices and with smiles ; their eyes followed him as he went slowly aft . Joshua , like everyone else , watched Barney . He knew , and the other officers knew , that Read was Barney 's target , and'they stepped away from Read , leaving him alone in the circle formed to face Barney . Joshua wondered for one wild moment , as he saw Barney 's face close , whether he would kill Read . " Captain Read . " Barney 's voice was low but like the crack of a whip . The murderous boarding pistol , one of the pair , was leveled at Read 's midsection . Barney said , " You 'll note , you sniveling coward , that I can either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts . Get off the decks ! " Read , nor anyone watching , did not question for a moment but that Barney would do as he had said . Without a word Read backed off , his eyes bulging with fear . He stumbled , and then dived into the door of the roundhouse . Barney shoved the pistol back into his belt , and surveyed the knot of officers . That was that . " Maybe the British 'll do for him what I did n't do . We 'll give  | them a chance , " he commented . " Mr. Harris , if you 'll present these officers to me , we can get started . " " Certainly , Barney , " Joshua said , in his excitement forgetting the names of every one of them . He tried to be calm . " I am the marine officer , sir , and ? " a name flashed before him ? " this is Mr. Hendrickson ? " he heard his voice go on . By the time he had finished things were already happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hand ; the quartermaster stood tense at the wheel , waiting . The gunnery officer was snapping out orders ; Barney was addressing the crew . " Men , " he said , his voice ringing across the deck , " we can tell the British to load their guns now . We 're ready to receive their lead . " They shouted and cheered ; a wave of sudden cheering came from them . " Remember , " said Barney , " to obey your officers ' orders quickly ; the quicker it 's done , the fewer of you 'll get killed . " This sobering note had just been sounded when Barney said to the first officer , " We will commence rowing now , Mr. Hendrickson . " Joshua heard another voice take up these orders . Almost in a daze he heard , from amidships : " Stand by the oars ! " They were clear . " Give way together ! " Joshua watched them dip into the blue water . The first inkling the people ashore had of the coming action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dip of her oars . They stared for a moment in amazement ; she was pulling toward the stranded " Triton , " sure enough ; from midchannel she was making for the enemy as fast as she could be rowed . Men with glasses leveled them in excitement , and a silence prevailed suddenly . The other rowgalleys had seen the longboat pull alongside the " Montgomery . " They had seen Barney board her . Their commanding officers , taut with excitement , realized instantly what Barney was going to try to do  --  silence her heavy guns and ready her for boarding . But they were too frail to venture closer now ; they waited . Aboard the " Triton , " Captain Rodgers watched the first dip of the oars . He had made ready for this attack and now it was coming . The danger was obvious . Boarding . So the hammocks and nettings were well triced , and all precautions possible taken astern , the quarter from which attack would certainly come . Marines were stationed  | at the rail , rifles in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , his place was right here , alongside of them , and here he intended to stay . At his side a lieutenant was looking through his glass . He blurted : " That 's Captain Barney , sir ! " He thrust out the glass . " He 's atop the binnacle head  --  his favorite place to watch from  --  he did that on the ' Revenge ' ! " Captail , Rodgers answered curtly , " When I want your information , Mr. Carr , I 'll ask for it . " But he knew now that the coming attack would be a determined one . Every man jack aboard was armed and ready . The stern cannon could be loaded and fired every fifty seconds . The " Montgomery " would have to be sunk , and Barney with it . Even as he thought this the cannon roared . Since there was no wind , the smoke was long in curling up and away . By the time it had risen the sponges had been rammed into smoking muzzles , the guns brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with powder and shot . Through the veiling smoke came the first cry of a wounded man from the " Montgomery . " Rodgers squinted through the smoke ; hanging in the mizzen weather shrouds he saw the damage the first shots had accomplished . When he saw it he blasted forth a long oath . Her foretop had been carried away ; even now it was being tossed overboard , along with cut trailing rigging . And a section of counter had been stove in , splintering the first two oars . It was probably one of the men on those oars who had cried out . Rodgers yelled : " I do n't want her dismasted ; I want her hulled ! Lower your sights ! " The guns boomed forth again . The " Montgomery 's " oars dipped regularly ; she was coming inexorably onward , over the rippling silvery river . Rodgers could hear the boatswain 's voice calling the strokes . Suddenly he saw she was going to come about to deliver her first broadside ; then she would present a better target . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery " came about . Her ten starboard six-pounders let fly ; at the same moment the " Triton " fired . Before Rodgers could see what the " Triton 's " guns had done he was more than aware of what the " Montgomery " had accomplished . One stern cannon was knocked from its carriage , and a stern port smashed in ; blood marked the deck .  | But the " Montgomery " had been hit badly . Heavy shot had ploughed across the afterdeck and through the roundhouse . She 'd been hit below the water fore . She had staggered under the blows . Barney had jumped down from the binnacle head . He was amidships now , directing the firing and the helmsman . " Hard aport ! Wait till the aftermost guns bear ! " The matchsticks flared noisily , sizzling . The crews bent over the gunsights ; the " Montgomery " came about and as she did another roar of British cannon tried to stop the maneuver . The " Montgomery " shook . She shuddered from stem to stern , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from decks and bulwarks ; a spar crashed to the deck alongside of Barney ; he leaned down and tossed it overboard , sailing it over the heads of the rowers . The guns fired ; he watched through the smoke ; they found their target . Barney raised his voice . When the smoke cleared he gave a shout of triumph . Another of the " Triton 's " guns had been hit ; it had spun around crazily , and a whole section of her counter had been stove in . " You 'll make mincemeat of her , lads , " yelled Barney . But worse punishment was coming and he knew it . The rifle fire had begun now . In between the heavier guns the peppering sound of the muskets kept up a staccato tattoo of deadly sound . The men stationed on the pumps below were working frantically to keep the water from rising so fast in the wells ; the wounded were being dragged from the decks to partial safety . All this while the " Montgomery " was making straight for the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distance between the two ships was narrowing fast now . They would make it ; he was sure of it ; they would make it . The " Montgomery 's " fore guns spoke as fast as they could be loaded , fired and reloaded . Another broadside should do the work . " Hard astarboard ! " The musket fire rained like hail onto the decks . Joshua , standing at the rail , concentrated only on his aim . They were drawing nearer and nearer , splintered oars rising and falling . He could not see that astern other rowgalleys were following in their wake . He did not hear the wild crazy cheers that came from shore . He heard Barney 's voice , but he was not conscious of what he said . He only knew to load and fire and reload , and to do his own job as fast and as accurately as possible . He aimed at the heads of the men he could see .  | The mizzen crashed to the deck alongside of him . Someone cleared It away . Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the frigate 's deck . The " Triton 's " last shot hit the " Montgomery " Gore . Tangles of mast and rigging hit the deck , her bowsprit was torn off like a splinter . Then the " Montgomery 's " starboard guns fired with deadly result . The last stern cannon on the " Triton " spun crazily . Her last heavy shot had been fired . The deck was slanting under Joshua 's feet . Now Barney himself had taken a wounded gunner 's place . The " Montgomery , " listing badly to port , was brought around to bring the starboard guns to bear upon the stern quarters of the " Triton . " Her broadside crashed in the enemy counter , spewed across her afterdecks . " Direct your men 's fire to the enemy quarterdecks and tops , Mr. Harris , " called Barney . The first officer had taken the wheel ; the helmsman was being borne below . The surgeon appeared , ran fore to Barney . " Sir ! " he cried . " I 've forty wounded ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgeon . Two more followed them , and alongside the longboat was drawing up in a hail of bullets that came from the " Triton . " They swarmed aboard , as Barney directed them fore to take position for boarding . Only twenty feet separated the two vessels . The " Montgomery 's " starboard guns had been reloaded . Once more they fired ; tilted upward of necessity , they hurled their cannon balls at the enemy 's stern . Joshua kept on loading and firing . They were close enough now . " Your targets are heads and chests , " he yelled . There was now no cheering from ashore ; no time for either combatant to waste time in jeers . The Americans ashore could see the other rowgalleys creeping nearer and nearer to the " Montgomery 's " sinking stern . Her incredibly gallant action was leading them like a magnet to the quarry she had readied . And her splintered oars still dipped as she narrowed the distance between her and the " Triton . " Joshua did n't see the irons swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deck now slanted badly , and he braced himself . It was slippery with blood . A man slipped down to deck beside him and lay still . Joshua dropped to his knees on the sloping deck and turned him over . He had been killed instantly . Over the sound of the fire of small arms then came Barney 's voice . " Boarders ! "  | Joshua realized suddenly that more men were surging onto the " Montgomery 's " deck , as she formed a frail wooden pathway to the " Triton . " She was kept afloat now only by the irons that held her to the frigate ; she would never sail again . But now she served like a bridge to enemy decks . Joshua yelled to his men to cover the boarding . He seized a cutlass and ran fore . The rigging and tangled foreyards and shrouds were massed with men . At their head was Barney , climbing fast , a pistol in each hand and his cutlass held in his teeth . He was the first over the side onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both pistols blazing fire . Then he used the murderous cutlass , as he and the twenty men first on the decks cut a swathe for the others to follow . By the time Joshua dropped to the " Triton 's " decks , Barney was at the rail . Joshua rushed forward , swung over the rail and dropped down amidships at the same time Barney did . Behind them came more . From the shore , the people could see that the galleys were discharging men as they raced across the sinking " Montgomery " to the " Triton . " They saw victory being slowly gained as the fighting surged forward on the frigate 's decks , as the British slowly retreated , as the Americans swarmed upward into the rigging to pick off one by one the men perched up there who were firing down upon their number . The boldest of them did this , climbing upward in the face of fire to bring down the topmen , to sway high in the shrouds to silence the enemy rifle fire from aloft . Inch by inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , fought his way forward with him . He knew he had been hit , but he could keep swinging the cutlass . Then suddenly he realized he and Barney were looking across a few feet of cleared deck , facing a knot of men at the forecastle rail . Barney said , " Have you struck ? " Behind him posed the invading force , eager for victory , not yet realizing it had been won . But a sudden silence pervaded the scene . The British captain held tight to the forecastle rail , because without its support he could not stand . He said , in the stillness : " Lower the colors . " His eyes met Barney 's ; three officers were at his side , and his remaining crew clustered on the forecastle . He drew his sword from its sheath ; the sunlight gleamed on the blade and the silver hilt . With a savage gesture he threw it ; it sailed like an arc into the muddy river .  | " I should never surrender it to a damned rebel , Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his leg . He staggered and Barney caught him as he fell . 15 DOUGLASS SAT VERY STILL IN THE CARRIAGE , HER HANDS CLASPED tightly in her lap . The driver had stopped the carriage at the top of the steep hill where Joshua had dismounted that morning . They had not been able to go any further because of the densely packed crowds . The city bells were still tolling . At the wharf was the " Triton , " her great masts dwarfing the other craft . Proud she looked , and stately in capture . On her gaff floated the stars and stripes . Douglass had been waiting here for half an hour . She had not spoken , so Lucie kept silence too . But Lucie moved restlessly in the seat , whereas madam sat in cold silence , not moving even a finger . For the tenth time Lucie prayed a silent slow prayer that M'sieur was safe . They knew that Barney was unhurt ; word had already circulated through the crowd that he was on the quarterdeck of the " Triton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken command . They knew that Read had been killed later . The crowd was shouting at Barney ; they called his name . Then Douglass suddenly saw that the crowd was parting , ahead of the carriage , and the first wounded were being carried from the " Triton . " The hammocks swung between their bearers . The sight dampened , , the cries of victory . Then Douglass saw two uniformed men carrying a chair between them . She flung open the door of the coach and ran toward them . Some of the people near called out , in jeers . Douglass paid no attention . She came up to the British captain just as the two officers set him and the chair down opposite a coach . " Captain Rodgers , " Douglass cried . He looked up at her . " Lady Annan , " he muttered incredulously . " Sir , you are hurt ! " He had taken the hand she held out ; the two British officers looked at her with certain longing ; their captain was kissing her hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come here ? It is under miserable circumstances that we meet . " He smiled a little . " But the wound  --  it is not much . " " Where are you going , Captain Rodgers ? " Douglass asked . " To a certain Quaker lady : Miss Goodenough . Lieutenant Barney has arranged it . We have given our parole . And I am forgetting the amenities . Your ladyship , allow me to present Lieutenants Mr. Mitchell and Laux . And my surgeon , Mr. Wilkes . " " I am charmed , gentlemen , " Douglass said . " It is good fortune that you will be residing next door to me . I shall look forward to the pleasure of your company . " Around them , the people crowded and stared . The damned British were as cool and unconcerned as though they were chatting on the Strand . The captain was once more kissing the lady 's hand in farewell . " I trust we part for a very short time , then . " Douglass smiled and swept them a curtsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went back to the carriage , the people making way for her grudgingly . In a sort of daze , the coachman jumped down and held the door for her . He slammed it . " We shall return home now , " Douglass said , her head high . Lucie stifled a cry of protest . The carriage swung around and started back toward Sixth Street . Once more Douglass maintained silence . The two carriages left the mob behind ; Douglass did not see that another carriage followed them closely . They drew up in front of the house in a matter of minutes . Douglass stepped from the carriage . Lucie followed more slowly , keeping her eyes on the wide street . At the doorway she heard Douglass instruct Marston to send two hams , a case of brandy , eggs , apples and a wedge of cheese next door to Miss Goodenough . " And you will kindly ask Miss Goodenough if she is in need of anything further , Marston . " " Yes , madam , " Marston said . Then they both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dieu ! " She ran out the big doors , dashing toward the coach which had stopped out front where theirs had just driven off to the stables . The door flew open and she heard Joshua 's voice . " For Christ 's sake , I can walk ! " " Do n't try it , sir , " said the man whose back was to Lucie . " You 'll hurry the bleeding again . "  | Joshua 's face was set with pain . His trouser leg had been slit , and it flapped as he stumbled out of the coach . Lucie saw the heavy bloodstained bandage around his upper leg . Another man seized him from the side . Douglass had also come flying down the path . She took one look at Joshua ; her quick mind came to a rapid decision . There would be few doctors available . " Lucie ! Prepare his bed ! Marston , show the men where to take him . Oh , Joshua , " she cried , then she took to her heels . She ran straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the surgeon , Mr. Wilkes . " Come , please , sir ! " she said . " We need you ! Desperately . Please ! " Without a word he took up his bag , which he had set down in the hallway . Douglass fled back along the brick sidewalk with him following . The men had carried Joshua upstairs and laid him on his bed . Partridge and Marston were with them ; they removed his boots ; they were preparing to undress him , and Lucie picked up the bloodstained boots and carried them out into the hallway , shutting the door behind her . Then Douglass came flying up the stairs with Wilkes behind her . Lucie spoke up . " I can aid you , sir . I aided the nuns ! " " We 'll see , " he said . He entered the room , with Douglass after him . Lucie saw him bend over Joshua and start to unwrap the bandages . " Get the fire lighted for the iron , " he said as he took out his scissors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slop bucket ; he lifted Joshua 's leg . Then he laid it down again on the bed . " Fetch linen , " he said to Lucie . And to Douglass , " The bullet will have to be removed . It looks like a large calibre ; it may be embedded in the bone . " Joshua had closed his eyes in the pain of having his leg lifted . Now he opened them and regarded Wilkes with suddenly narrowed eyes . " Who the hell are you ? " he asked . " Mr. Wilkes , Joshua , the surgeon of the Triton , ' " Douglass said breathlessly . " The bullet , sir , did not come out  --  it 's still there ; I deeply regret to tell you . " Wilkes leaned down and fished in his bag . Lucie came back with linen . She folded a sheet in fourths and slid it deftly under the injured leg . She paid no attention to the surgeon or the other  | men . She filled a basin with water , and started to bathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took scissors and started to rip out bandages from an old soft sheet . The surgeon was wiping the blood away from the wound ; it was not welling up so fast now . " I shall have to probe , " he said . Lucie poured some brandy into a glass . She held it to Joshua 's lips . " Drink it , sir , " she whispered . He gulped it down . He saw the glitter of the instrument in Wilkes 's hand . He set his teeth . The pain was excruciating . It came in terrible waves . Then it stopped . He sucked in a breath . " Jesus , " he muttered . " I have n't got it yet , " Wilkes said . At the same moment the door was flung open . Barney stood on the threshold . His eyes briefly took in the scene . Then he stepped forward and took Wilkes by the back of the collar . He yanked him past the bed , to the doorway , to allow the man who had come with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney looked as though he were trying to control his anger . Then the violence blazed forth . " D'ye break your parole so easy ? " With angry hands he flung the Britisher backwards into the hall and laid him fiat on his back . Barney swung around . " Joshua ! " he said , coming over to the bed . " I 've brought you the best surgeon in the city , Dr. Hindman . I pray to God you have n't suffered too much at the hands of that bloody incompetent ! Lucie , give him some brandy ! " Dr. Hindman took Joshua 's hand and stood over him , feeling the pulse . " A little brandy , Mr. Harris , " he said , " and then we shall look at your leg . Barney , you 're exciting my patient ! I do n't need you , nor you , madam . " Once more Lucie spoke . " I can aid you , sir . I am trained . " Dr. Hindman smiled . " You are , Lucie ? I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittered with pain and excitement . " Barney , the Triton , ' 32 ! I can finance her ! " Barney said , " I 've already given your boys at the yards the order to get to work on her ! " Dr. Hindman said , " Barney ! " Barney grinned . " That intelligence will calm him down . There 's nothing more to be done now for him to worry over . I 'll go now , Doctor . " " I 'll throw you out , " I-Iindman said , smiling , but keeping his eyes  | on Joshua 's and his fingers on his pulse . Joshua was sipping the brandy Lucie held to his lips . " It wo n't take long , " Barney said comfortingly . He turned to Douglass . She looked white and shaken . He stood aside for her to precede him , and closed the door behind them . " I 've had bullets dug out of me , sweetheart , " he whispered . " It hurts  --  but that passes , too . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He backed off from Barney . Barney said levelly : " When a man disobeys an order he gets punished . " He motioned him to the stairs . Wilkes went . He went slowly down the steps and toward the big doorway . The two men who had brought Joshua home were still standing out front , and a crowd had gathered because they knew Barney was in the house . Barney called to the two men . " Throw this man in jail , " he said curtly . " He 's broken parole . " He closed the big doors and turned to face Douglass . She was looking at him incredulously . She whirled away from him , and into the long room at the right . In the silence the clock struck three . Barney took a long stride to come through the archway into the drawing room . Four feet away she stood , facing him , her great grey eyes in her white face regarding him ; they dropped from his face past the wide shoulders to the big belt with a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were on his hands , and he looked down at them . One hand was still marked with blood . He pulled the pistols from his belt and laid them on the polished top of the clavichord ; the murderous layments were held back in place now against the long barrels . He took a step toward her . " I 'd like something to drink , Madam Harris , if you will . " She brushed past him ; he smelled faint perfume . He heard her tell Marston to bring brandy and whiskey . She turned back to him . " Is that what you want ? " she asked . Barney went over to the window and sat on the deep sill . He waited till Marston appeared with a tray which he set on the coffee table . Marston left the room . Then Barney said , " I 'd prefer whiskey , if you please . " Douglass said , " Wo n't you help yourself , sir ? " " Yes , if you do n't want to do it for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two glasses of whiskey ; he brought one over  | to her . He tossed his off and went on , slowly . " It was the fault of bad seamanship . Then , as a final foolish gesture , Captain Rodgers refused to surrender his sword . Rather than surrender it to me , he threw it overboard , silver and all . " " I 'm proud that he did ! " Douglass said . He stood over her . " He might better have destroyed these . " Douglass stared at what he held in his hand . Her heart beat fast . " They are ? " " Yes , English . The codebooks . " He put them back under his coat . He went over to the coffee table and poured another glass of whiskey . " He 'll be court-martialed and broke , probably . Are you ready to join me ? To the day 's events ! " Douglass hurled her glass into the fireplace ; against the bricks it shattered . " Join you ? " she cried . She rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Wilkes came here expressly because I begged it of him ! " Barney frowned . Douglass thought he understood . " It was not his fault , therefore . " " Not his fault ? " Barney repeated . " Madam , when a man gives his word it 's no excuse that he breaks it for a woman . In fact , it 's less excuse . You 'll pardon that line of reasoning , I 'm sure . " Douglass said incredulously , " You wo n't have him released then ? " " No , madam , " said Barney . Then he said , " But I will not have him placed in a dungeon , with irons on both legs and wrists . Nor will I starve him ! " He took her hand and swung her around to face him . " I have my real prize in the codebooks ! Ah , here is Dr. Hindman . " He dropped her hand . Dr. Hindman said , " You can not see him now , sir . But the bullet was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened his palm . " You see , it is still in its original shape . Madam , he will probably be feverish ; he has lost much blood . Miss Lucie is competent . I shall myself return this evening , even if it is late . I go now to the hospital , where Captain Barney has sent all the wounded . And if you should need me , before I come , send a note . " " Thank you , Doctor . " " I 'm ready , Barney . Goodbye , madam . " " Goodbye , Doctor , " Douglass said . Barney bent over her hand . " Your obedient servant , madam , " he said . " Please tell Joshua I 'll call tomorrow , and if he wants me , send word . "  | Douglass stood by herself in the empty room . She went slowly toward the hall . On the top of the clavichord lay the two gleaming pistols . She stopped . She ran one finger over the long barrel . Then she withdrew her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S ROOM STOOD OPEN . A LOW FIRE BURNED IN the grate and atop the mantel the clock ticked in the silent room . The bedcurtains were hooked back ; the candles flickered ; the clock struck gently three times . Douglass changed her position slightly . Then she saw Lucie . Lucie slipped into the room . She was fully dressed , in her grey gown and tiny white apron . " Madame , " she whispered . Douglass threw a glance at the sleeping figure of Joshua . She rose and drew Lucie out into the hall . " What is it ? " Lucie said , " You must sleep , madame . I have wakened and dressed . I will take up the vigil . " Douglass said , " It is three . I had been thinking ; I did not realize how late it was . " " I will watch over him , Mr. Joshua , " Lucie said . Douglass nodded . " He is asleep . " She started away . " But call me , Lucie , should you need me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your bed . " Lucie tiptoed back into the silent room . A chair had been pulled up to the bed ; Lucie sat down in it . Joshua lay full length in the big bed , one arm flung out as though he had pushed the pillow aside and fallen asleep in that position . Lucie leaned forward and touched his hand . It was not too hot ; she leaned back in the chair and sighed with relief , keeping her eyes on him . She could look her fill ; he was sleeping quietly . She could hear his breath ; his chest rose and fell evenly . Then suddenly he moved , a quick restless turn ; the quick movement must have hurt his leg . He spoke ; then his eyes opened . He lay still ; he became aware of the presence of someone else , and turned his head to see who was in the room . He frowned at her .  | " Lucie , " he muttered . He raised himself on one elbow cautiously , looking around the dimly lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A half after three , sir . " " I 'm hot , " Joshua grumbled irritably , and pushed back the top blanket and grimaced , for he had moved his leg . Lucie cried , " I do it ! " She took the top blanket off , and folded it back . She felt his eyes on her , and she straightened and looked back at him . " I was dreaming , " he said , frowning at her . " Oui , m'sieur , " Lucie said . " Did I speak aloud ? " he asked , keeping his frown . She nodded , catching her lip in white teeth . " Oui . " " Well , tell me what I said ! " Joshua gave a grunt as he started to sit up and feel for a pillow . Lucie was torn between answering his question and helping him find the pillow ; with his eyes on her she found difficulty in doing anything . But she lifted the big pillow and shoved it behind him . Joshua leaned back against it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair back . " Well ? " he asked . " You said , sir I am trying to recall exact  --  you said : Now that you have the ship I ca n't sail with you because of this goddamned leg ! ' " Joshua said forcibly , " What a silly damn dream ! " Then he smiled a little . " My language sounds incongruous on your lips . " He drew a deep breath and tried easing his leg into another position . " Cramped , " he said . Once more he looked up at her . " What are you doing here , Lucie ? " " Madame and I ? " Lucie said . " We watch . " " Oh , God , " said Joshua . " What are you watching ? If there 's anything I hate , it 's women fussing . " Lucie 's eyes regarded him . " I do not fuss , sir . " Joshua smiled . " Do n't you ? " She hesitated . " I do n't think I do . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed . " I think I know , " she said , gravely . " But perhaps I do not understand the male mind . Do you want your man ? " " Lord , no , " said Joshua ; he was amused . " Go on , Lucie . Explain further . "  | She said , " You fight and receive a bullet . I make you comfortable and do what you ask . " " Direct and simple , " said Joshua , " and there may be some merit to such a program . A pity I ca n't take full advantage of it . " " What , sir ? " asked Lucie . He grinned . " I 'm thirsty . First I ask for half a glass of water . " " Oui , m'sieur , " she said , turning away . Joshua peered past her . " Hold , " he said , as he watched . " Enough . Assez ! " She turned to look . " Pour a trifle out and now fill it up with whiskey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucie , filling the glass . She brought it over to him and watched him as he tasted it . " Does it suit ? " " Oui , " said Joshua . She said , " You mimic me . " " Oui , " he said . He looked at her . " Damn it , you 're a beautiful female . Your accent is music to the ears ; you have me at a disadvantage immediately with it . Say something else to me . " She leaned forward , the candlelight shining on the auburn braids . " What do you wish I should say ? No , I intend  --  what do you wish to say about ? Is that right ? " " Where were you born ? " Joshua asked . " In Normandie . Near the sea . We have great rocky coast . It is very beautiful there . " " I know , " said Joshua . " Do you want to go back ? " " No , m'sieur . " " No ? " He drank the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He yawned . " I do n't know why I 'm so sleepy , " he said . " I was going to smoke a pipe . " Lucie said , " You had laudanum . " " Laudanum ? How long did Dr. Hindman say I 'd be confined in this damned bed ? " " He did not say . Captain Barney said to tell you he would call tomorrow . " " I think , " said Joshua , " I 'll stay drunk for two days and then get up . " Lucie dimpled . " Do I amuse you ? " Joshua growled . " Oui , " said Lucie . " You are so mad because somebody shot you . " She held the glass , and she turned to put it down on the table . She came back to the bedside . " Now what you want , sir ? "  | Joshua smiled and looked sleepy . Lucie said , solemnly , " Is it fuss if I straighten the linen ? " She waited for his answer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back again . Lucie bent over him , to smooth out and turn down the sheet . " La , " she said . Joshua reached for her with both hands . " I could n't resist , " he began , looking into her dark blue eyes ; he caught her head between his hands and pulled her down for a kiss on the red lips so near his . " Urn , " he said , releasing her . " That was nice . " He smiled as she straightened up quickly . " Was n't it ? " he asked , catching her hand in his . " Oui , " she said . She sat down . Joshua kept hold of her hand . His eyes closed . Lucie thought he was sound asleep . When his voice came , she jumped . " What are you thinking about ? " His blue eyes were open again . She said , " I was thinking that was how a kiss worked , m'sieur . " Her heart beat fast . He grinned . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She was silent . The next time she looked at him he was asleep . 17 IT WAS THE THIRTIETH OF NOVEMBER , A COLD GREY DAY IN BOTH New York and Philadelphia . In New York harbor , aboard the flagship " Sandwich , " Admiral George Rodney dipped his pen and began to write . " The occurrence of consequence is Lord Cornwallis ' retreat in North Carolina . The whole expedition appears to me to have been an ill-concerted measure and could only tend to weaken the army and give the rebels the opportunity of destroying our troops by detail . " He leaned back in his chair and frowned . Then he continued . This was an important letter , for he must make clear to Lord Sandwich the state of the war in these colonies . " The Highlands of Hudson River , which cut off communication between northern and southern provinces here , was the post which  | Arnold was to have betrayed to us . The rebels would have been unclone had the scheme succeeded . At all events it must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered . I offered every assistance but was told it was too late . " " The damned fools , " he muttered aloud in the silent cabin . His anger enabled him to proceed strongly . " The evacuation of Rhode Island was the most fatal measure that could have been adopted . It gave up the best harbor in America from whence squadrons in forty-eight hours could blockade the three capital cities . France has wisely taken advantage of our misconduct , and has made it now impregnable . I now come to the third evacuation  --  Portsmouth and Hampton , a post which commands the Chesapeake . I fear again this will hamper the actions of the fleet here immensely . Now I myself shall proceed immediately to my station in the West Indies . " He stood up . Retreat in Carolina ; the loss of Portsmouth and Rhode Island ! His mouth was bitter . In Philadelphia that day the newspapers printed a newly written poem alongside the war news from Carolina . They boxed it on the front page , for Captain Barney was recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear , To wealth and honor we will steer , In the Athena privateer Commanded by bold Barney . She 's new and true and tight and sound , Well rigged aloft and all well found , Come and be with laurel crowned , Away and leave your lasses . " Barney looked up from the paper . " I could have done better myself , " he said . " And it gets worse . " Gouverneur Morris smiled . The paper lay on the table , and Gouverneur tapped it with his finger . " Seems now to be incontrovertible the British have bitten off more than they can chew in Carolina . God , that 's a bloody campaign , Barney . " Barney said , " Cornwallis could be completely cut off by sea power ? he would be forced to surrender . " He motioned to a waiter , got  | a pipe and regarded Gouverneur through a cloud of smoke . They had just finished breakfast ; they were sitting at their ease in the London Coffee Shop , favorite meeting place for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Second Street . Gouverneur produced a watch from his waistcoat pocket . " We have a few minutes , " he said . " How is the recruiting going ? " Barney said , " I 've bought the best gunnery officer in the States out of debtor 's jail . Twenty of the British crew volunteered  --  I took them , for they were mostly topmen . The marines ? " He grinned . " They 're mostly Bucks county backwoodsmen . Lord , how they can shoot . They do n't waste bullets ; they shoot to kill , sir . Ever since they 've been ten and allowed the use of a rifle , they 've had to account to their fathers for the amount of bullets expended . They 've got to have some game to show for those bullets . That 's one thing the British ca n't understand ; an American rifleman shoots to kill . Habit , sir . " He drew on his pipe . " I 'll make marines out of them . " " I 'm sure you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing it off his elegant pink coat with its row of gold buttons . When he pushed back his chair and stood , his wooden peg leg was in violent contrast to the elegance of his dress . He had a habit of tapping the peg for attention . A servant came dashing over with his cloak and hat . Gouverneur allowed him to place the cloak on his shoulders , and tipped him well . " Intelligence reports that Rodney is sailing soon for the West Indies , Barney , " he said . " You know there 's nothing better than Washington 's secret service . " " If you know what the enemy is going to do ? " Barney flung out his hands . Gouverneur could walk very fast on his leg , and he swung out the door . The few loungers on the wide wooden settee out on the brick pavement stared at the two men . They crossed Front Street . It was such a dark cold day they could see the oil lights shining through the windows of both Morris ' and Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Joshua himself . He was using his cane , and he descended the one step down from his door with difficulty . He had negotiated it when he looked up and saw the other two men . " You should n't be here , " Barney said . Joshua explained with a variety of oaths that he had stayed in bed three days . " And I 've been conducting business with three clerks  |  --  two men and one bottle , " Joshua ended . " I 've had a hell of a time . " Gouverneur tapped his leg . " I know all about it , sir . But the stories I could tell you , of sympathetic ladies  --  which of course I am honor bound to keep to myself  --  those stories would tempt you to part with one of yours . " He grinned , and threw open the door to Robert Morris ' offices , which he shared . The two men were not related , even though they bore the same name . But they were carrying the burden of financing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered Robert Morris ' private office . All three of them had nothing but admiration and affection for Robert Morris . Gouverneur and Joshua , born of wealthy and old families , differed thus from Robert Morris , who had made his own way , orphaned at sixteen , the son of a port agent for a British merchant firm . " Robert Morris , " Joshua had said , " is a damned genius , a financial wizard . No one else could have done it ; the United States of America owes him an eternal debt . When the treasury is worse than empty we can borrow as a nation , because Morris pledges his word . " As for Barney , he felt a kinship with Morris . Both men had lost their fathers early through accidental gunshot . Morris had sailed more than once around the world ; if ever a man knew the value of a Navy , he did . " Where our ships go , so must our Navy ; trade is the lifeblood of a nation , and it must be protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had ended , " I will add , for myself , that if you continue to act with the same bravery and devotion , you shall always find me a friend ready and happy to serve you . " " Joshua , " Robert Morris said , repeating Barney 's words , " you should n't be here . " " I brought the bond , " Joshua said . He had sat down gratefully before the fire . He produced the bond of which he had spoken . He handed it to Barney . " Read it , Barney , " he suggested , a little wearily . It was very familiar . " Know all men by these presents , that we , Joshua Harris , merchant , and Benjamin Barney , mariner , of the city of Philadelphia , are held and firmly bound to the Treasurer of the United States of America in the penalty of twenty thousand Spanish milled dollars or other money the equivalent thereto , by force of arms , to attack , seize , or subdue , the enemies ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Morris . " Privateering again , " he said .  | Morris nodded . " Some day , Barney ? " He broke off , and stood up . " I 've been immured here , behind this desk , too long . " He walked across to the fire . " Let it be a consolation to you , sir , that your summer cruises last year financed the whole of our diplomatic services abroad for all the years of the war , and are still financing them ; that they helped most materially in drawing our allies into this war , and that from accounts sent me you have charmed the court of France with your forthright personality . " " Thank you , " Barney said . Morris picked up the bond . " Now you shall be , as soon as this is signed and witnessed , in possession , " he read , " of the Athena , ' of thirty-two guns , with a crew of three hundred and forty officers and men . " He paused . " Every prize you take , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . Do you know what I 'm going to do now ? I 'm going begging , for pay for the troops . " Gouverneur explained . " From door to door . " He stumped over to the nearest chair and sat down , regarding his leg . Barney said , " Are those buttons gold , Gouverneur ? " Gouverneur looked up and nodded . Barney reached in his pocket and handed over his knife . Gouverneur started to saw off the buttons . While he sawed he talked . " Christmas coming , and the troops have n't been paid for months ; they 're grumbling and I do n't blame them . " He laid the buttons one by one on the desk , and then looked at his coat . " Damn you , Barney , " he said , " you 're so practical . " Barney grinned . He was in the presence of three of the wealthiest men in the United States and none of them had a cent in cash . " I can raise a little cash , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wizard . " How ? " asked Joshua . " Simple , " said Barney . " My little house is clear . I 'll go over to Girard and borrow in Spanish dollars on it . As much as I can get . " " I 'll give you a note for it , " Morris said . " Also , " said Barney , " I 've got a number of captured weapons ? fifty guinea dress swords , and such  --  duelling pistols . There are many men in the city who 'd pay high for them . " " Yes , there are , sir , " Joshua said . " Do you have many , Barney ? " " Chests of ' em , " said Barney . Gouverneur burst out laughing . " That damned Rodgers , " grumbled Barney , " tossed his silverhilted one in the Delaware but he surrendered a matched set of fowl-  | ing pieces with silver mountings . When you remember I took sixty ships last summer and spring alone , sirs , you realize a lot of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A parade of ' em , " said Gouverneur , still convulsed with laughter . " I 'll take over the selling of them , " he said to Robert Morris . " Let 's get this bond signed , and have a drink to it . " Morris smiled . " Get the whiskey , my friend , " he said . " He 's been working day and night , Joshua , " he continued as Gouverneur went over to his desk and got out a bottle of whiskey . " Why do n't you take him with you , Barney ; inspect the parade of surrendered dress swords , and take the rest of the day . Have some fun . " Gouverneur was pouring out four cups of whiskey . He looked up from his task . " I 'd like to talk to Barney , " he said , " about France ? and such like . I 'm angling for diplomatic service after the war . " He passed the cups to each man . Joshua and Barney each signed the bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment on , " he said , " the Athena ' ! Who named her ? " " Joshua did , " Barney answered . " He says she sprang from my head . " " Fully panoplied , " Robert Morris quoted . " Perhaps she did , Barney . " Gouverneur raised his glass . " Allow me a bit of romanticism : To the goddess and to the ship ! " 18 AT THREE THAT AFTERNOON THE CHILL LATE NOVEMBER WIND blew hard off the river . Lamplight from the shops shone out into the city streets . Lucie passed the Cathcart 's bookshop and apothecary at Second and Elfreth 's Alley , and even though she was thoroughly cold , she stopped for just a moment to try to read the recipe on the open page of a new cookbook . Just as she stopped , Joshua opened the door of the shop and came limping out into the street . " Lucie , " he said , surprised . " M'sieur ! " she exclaimed . The wind blew the ends of her gay knitted yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks were pink with cold . " You look pretty as a picture , " Joshua said . " I 've the coach . I 'll take you home . " " Thank you , m'sieur , " she said . But she did n't move ; she looked up at him . " Are you feeling ? " she searched for the right word ? " fine ? How is your leg ? " She was very concerned , and Joshua smiled . " You 're keeping me standing on it . " " Mon Dieu ! Forgive me , m'sieur ! " She looked around for the coach , flew across the pavement and opened the door . She called up to the coachman , " Why you not have this ready open , for m'sieur ? " As Joshua got in , she said , " He is bastard ? " Joshua sat down in the seat and laughed . She eyed him questioningly , and was about to close the door when Joshua leaned forward and caught her hand . " Get in , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was still chuckling . " Lucie , Lucie , " he said reprovingly . She clasped her hands . " What did I do ? " " Where did you hear the word bastard ? " Joshua asked sternly . She glanced at him . " From you , sir . " " Oh , lord , " said Joshua . " Never repeat my words , Lucie . " He smiled . " My language is too full of liabilities for you . " He added , " You must have heard a great many words from me , lately . I expect I was a rather irritable patient , was n't I ? " " Terrible , " said Lucie , truthfully . " Here come these rolled is at me again , " Joshua said . " They say women are better patients than men . " " Oui , " said Lucie . She sighed and gave him an angelic smile . " But I rather take care of you . " " Would you ? " asked Joshua . " What were you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't meet his eyes . " Walking ? " Joshua looked at her . " You 're shivering with the cold , Lucie . " He put his arm around her and drew her close to him , turning her face to his with one hand . At his nearness , Lucie found words more difficult . " What were you doing ? " she asked low , looking at the collar of his cloak . " I was going to buy a book to read tonight , but I decided I did n't have enough money . " Her eyes widened . " Enough money ? "  | He said , " Cash is short , Lucie . I ca n't expect you to understand my finances , but all the gold we have ? " He explained how Gouverneur Morris had taken the gold buttons off his coat . Her eyes were studying him as he spoke . " I have gold , sir , " she said . Joshua smiled . " You do , Lucie ? " " Oui , " she nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds ? " Joshua exclaimed . " Oui ! Five pounds a month for twelve months . Captain Barney paid me in gold ! " She lifted her face to his . " I give it for the troops . " Joshua kissed her quickly , and drew back a little to study her face . " You 'll have a note for it , Lucie . " " A note ? " she whispered . " What is that ? " " I mean you 'll get it back ; I promise , " Joshua said , his mind not on his words . " I do n't want it back , sir ; I was saving it for my dot  --  my dowry . " She drew a deep breath . " Now I do not think I ever marry . " " What ? " asked Joshua . He looked deep into her eyes . She said , " When George ask me to marry him today , I knew I tell him no . " " What ? " Joshua growled . " Who is George ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How did you meet ? " Joshua broke off . For the last three days , George Griffiths had been in and out of the house . " He worked fast , the bastard , " Joshua announced ; then he grinned . " Do n't repeat that , Lucie . So you turned George down ? " She nodded , wordlessly . " Why ? " ? " Because , " she whispered . Joshua kissed her . When the coach jolted to a stop in front of the big house , the coachman jumped down to open the door . He closed it again . But Lucie had heard it close . The sound of it made her open her eyes . She withdrew her arms from around Joshua 's neck and laid a mittened hand against the side of his face . " We are home , " she whispered , drawing away from him a little . She traced one finger along his face , and Joshua kissed her again , for a moment holding her close . Then he released her , leaned forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coachman a brief stare . Lucie got out and walked  | at his side into the house . Within the fires were burning and there was the smell of woodsmoke . Even Marston smiled at her today . She looked up at Joshua as Marston divested him of his cloak . " I go to madame , now , " she said . 19 DOUGLASS WAS WAITING . AS SOON AS LUCIE APPEARED , AND AS SOON as she had shut the door , Douglass grasped up her red cape . " He has gone ? " she asked . " Oui , madame . " Lucie unfastened her own cape and removed it . " He has gone to the cockfights and then to the theatre and supper . " " The theatre ? " asked Douglass . She went over to her mirror , regarding her piled curls , so lightly dusted with powder . She picked up a filmy veil . " The theatre ? The little singer , Judy , probably ! " She set her full mouth . " Goodbye , Lucie . I shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglass go out alone and on foot . He wondered where she was going , and then decided that probably she was only going next door , to visit with the English captain and his officers . He shut the big door after her . Once in the street , Douglass walked fast , her cape flying behind her . She had seven blocks to walk and she walked them quickly . At Elfreth 's Alley she slowed her pace . It was very narrow , cobblestoned , with a tiny sidewalk about two feet wide . She gathered her cape close and walked along ; she could look into the houses , through the many paned windows . Toward the end of the block she paused ; at right angles Bladen 's Court ran from the alley , and Douglass stepped around the corner quickly . A giant tree sheltered one of the houses under its spreading limbs . She passed a stone-walled well , and stepped up the one step to a white doorway . She lifted the brass knocker . Absolom answered the door . Douglass entered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his house . She looked around the white panelled hall ; a lazy wood fire burned and the stairway went up around it . A pair of beautiful chairs flanked a French table with a mirror atop it ; she caught a glimpse of herself , and she realized Absolom was saying :  | " Captain Barney is not at home , ma'am . May I take a message ? " Douglass knew very well he was not at home . But her voice was unsteady as she said , " I will wait . " She gave a glance to the empty room at her right . " I 'll keep my cape , " she added . She could not push aside the feeling that any moment she would hear Barney 's tread , and that he would be there , looking at her with his dark eyes . She said , " I will wait , in the study ! " She knew of the room from Joshua ; he had spoken of it and described it to her . Absolom was confused . " But ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cockfights , too , ma'am , and ? " " He may return . " Douglass turned her eyes on him , and Absolom wilted . " Yes , ma'am . I 'll take you up . There 's a fire lighted . " Douglass sighed , and made for the steps . She climbed slowly . Upstairs the same white panelling marked the pretty hall . In the room to her right again she saw indeed the fire was lighted ; she could hear it crackling , and it threw a warm glow over the room . " I shall light the lamps , ma'am , " Absolom said . Douglass watched the room come to life . As the light sprang up she saw the cushioned window seat , the round globe in its polished wooden frame . She saw his desk ; on one wall were a pair of magnificent duelling pistols , and a gold-hilted sword . Next to them hung a barometer . In front of the fire was his padded chair and stool , with his table beside it . And over the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared up at it , the white cliffs of Dover , and the " Revenge . " Absolom was looking at her , and she turned to him . " I shall wait a few minutes . " He turned and left her . She did not even hear his " Yes , ma'am . " But he was gone and she was alone in Barney 's study . Her fingers were icy . Her heart was pounding in her throat . She leaned over and picked up one of his pipes , and then set it down again . Once more she looked up at the " Revenge . " Then she went over to the desk and opened the first drawer . The papers rustled under her fingers . Charts ; charts and legal papers . The second drawer yielded nothing but letters , and she closed that one hastily . She listened . The whole house was still . Gradually her hands grew calmer . She searched through the two remaining drawers : nothing but more charts , writing paper , sealing  | wax . She closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the biggest lamp . She walked across the hall on tiptoe , and peered into the room directly opposite the study , across the hall . Within another fire burned , and thus this room must be his bedroom . She entered it . She set the lamp down on the bedside table . It had one drawer , but there was nothing inside it at all . Once more she picked up the lamp , and crossed the room to the highboy , with the shadow following her . She listened again . There was no sound . So , one by one , she opened the drawers . The highboy contained nothing but clothing . She shut the last drawer . At the foot of the bed was his sea chest . She left the lamp on the highboy . Her red cape glowed like the fire in the fireplace . She looked down at the chest . Double bronze nailheads made an oval on its top , in which a B was scrolled . The nailheads rimmed the lid , and the bottom , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chain , was in the lock . Desperately she turned the key in its lock and lifted the lid . Barney had already laid within it a few things that he wished to take . Charts of the Caribbean , marked and revised by his own hands , with the native names for small bays and coves . Douglass drew one out , and opened it , folded it and put it back again . She leafed through the charts , when a sound in the distance startled her . She knelt there , by the open chest , frozen . Had she heard voices and the tread of feet ? She did n't move a muscle ; she listened . She had heard a voice . But it was outside . She breathed a little easier when suddenly she heard the sound of a door opening downstairs , and she heard the familiar voice say : " Come in , gentlemen . " Douglass rose to her feet so quickly it seemed that the whole room tipped on one end . She stood there , paralyzed , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least four different male voices ; then there was a sudden quiet . She knew with certainty that Absolom was telling Barney a woman waited for him . The silence ended abruptly . She heard a deep laugh . Then a voice said , and it was Gouverneur Morris , " You lucky dog . With this money shortage I 'm going to have to find a wench who loves me for myself alone . Is she beautiful , Absolom ? " Absolom must have nodded . " Look at his eyes shine , " another voice said ; then Barney 's cut through .  | " I 'll be back in a few moments , sirs . Absolom , get the gentlemen something to drink . " " Do n't hurry , Barney . " He was coming upstairs . The tread she had imagined when she had first entered the house was real now . In desperation she fled across the room to a white door and flung it open . " Oh , lord , " she whispered . It was a closet . She shut the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fell to the floor , just as Barney came to stand on the threshold of the room . " Barney , " she whispered . He towered there . His dark eyes looked back at her ; his cloak swung from his shoulders ; he was wearing his calf high boots . His dark eyes looked back at her , then they went to his open sea chest , to the single lamp burning on the highboy , and then they came back to her again , standing there in the middle of his bedroom , his gaze going slowly over her until it reached the cape on the floor . He did not speak to her . He took one step and closed the door behind him , pushing it shut . The latch clicked . His voice came at her . " And to what do I owe this pleasure , madam ? " He unfastened his cloak and removed it , tossing it on his big fourposter bed . She did not answer . He came toward her . " I want the truth , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at him now . " You shall have it ! " You know why I 'm here ! " She leaned over and picked up her cape , slinging it over her arm . She faced him again . " I did n't get what I came for ! So you can go back to Judy now ! " " By Christ , " Barney said , trying to control the rising wrath , " be careful ! And answer my question ! " " I 'll answer it ! " Imitating him , she flung her own cape alongside of his on the bed . The filmy veil was still about her hair , and she drew it down over her bare shoulders , slowly . " I came for the codebooks ! " The heavy muscles along his jaw set ominously as he forced himself to keep his hands off her until this wave of anger passed . " You know , English , " he said , " my sea chest is my most personal possession , and you 've had your little fingers in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very low , and as he spoke he felt the hot anger being gradually controlled . His eyes went from her to the closed door to the smooth made-up bed .  | She was replying passionately . " Wilful hands , mine ? What of yours ? How you held those codebooks in front of me , challenging me with them ? Did n't you know I would try to get them back ? Did n't you know that when you did it , Captain Barney ? " She threw the name at him . He approached her slowly . " Had you been in my place , you would have tried ! " " I ? " He looked down at her and there was the vestige of the old smile on his face . " Do you imitate the crude rough Yankee , now ? " His fingers closed around her slender wrist , tightening , and he lifted her hand and put it against his chest . " Here are the codebooks , " he said . Her grey eyes blazed ; he looked at the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want them ? " She tried to wrench her hand away . " Ah , I hate you , Barney , " she whispered . " You flaunt them you , the victor . Well , that 's done , Barney . You won . " " Yes . " She turned away , forgetting the fingers pressing her hand ; she turned , and was brought up short by those strong fingers . She asked wildly , " Then why do n't you go on to the theatre now ? " He looked at her beautiful head and the bare shoulders . " Because you intrigue me much more . " She lifted one hand to touch her hair . " Go seek out the little Judy ; she 'll suit you better ! " " Her real name is Marie . " Her lashes flew up ; her body was tense . Barney dropped her hand and went over to the fireplace , leaning his elbow on the mantel . His eyes searched her . The angry jealousy that she felt was accompanied by the blinding flash of realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It was he she had followed here ; he for whom she had deserted England ; he for whom she dressed and lived and breathed . She said : " Yesterday  --  I mean three days ago  --  you expected me to congratulate you on a victory . " He answered this . " Yes ! " " Even supposing I had no conflicting loyalties , you offered physical insult and violence on my countryman , who was present at my request  --  nay , my urgent pleas . "  | " He broke parole , " Barney said . " And you should have depended on me . " She looked over at him . " On you ? " " Yes , madam . I knew Joshua was hurt . Instead of waiting for Inc , you go dashing for aid from your British friends ! " " And I am not permitted British friends ? " " No , " he said . " Oh , " she cried , " but I am not your property ! " " Not yet . By God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Patient ? " she repeated incredulously . " Do not interrupt me . I 'll talk now . I should never have told you about the codebooks ; it was an action born of anger . " He walked over to her . " But I never thought you would attempt to steal them ! Meddling in men 's affairs is a dangerous business ; you are guilty of a treasonable act , and we have been at war five years and every effort has been made to gain an honorable victory . Fortunately for you no one but me knows . I see you are still unconvinced , English ! " She had turned away from him , and he reached for her , turning her around to face him . She drew a long breath and tipped her head back to look up at him . Barney said , " There 's a loaded pistol in my pocket , for I usually go armed . Had this room been in darkness , I might have used it , without knowing who you were . I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll test the truth of that . You would n't have sent one of those paroled officers here , would you ? " " No , " she said . " You might have ? " " Killed him , I 'll end it for you . " She turned her face away from him . " Brutal words , Douglass , but this is a war , and men feel deeply about it . Let me warn you not to tell Joshua , or you will find out to your sorrow that such a sortie into betrayal will not be condoned . You are only a woman and you do not understand . " " I do understand ! " " By Christ , " he said , " if I thought you did , I 'd ? " His hands tightened on her shoulders . " No . You did it to get back at me ; it 's a personal matter between the two of us , and I will handle it . Now . " " No ! " cried Douglass . " I did it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you ? " " As the last thing I would ever do ! " " You 'll retract that , shortly . You came here to me alone . You  | were married for a week , to a boy . Why do n't you admit you came as a woman , seeking to give yourself completely to me ? Well , then , I 'll be back in a moment . " His hands dropped from her , and he went to the door . He left it open and she heard him going quickly down the steps . With a quick gesture she snatched up her cape from the bed ; she too went to the door , crossed the hall , and set her foot on the topmost step . Below her , in the hallway , was a jumble of men 's voices . She heard not a word of what they were saying , or of Barney 's voice explaining briefly that he had forgot a previous engagement and that they would have to excuse him . Douglass was halfway down . " Rendezvous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he broke off . Douglass was halfway down the stairs . She had snatched up the cape so quickly that it trailed from one hand , its whole brilliant length behind her on the steps . The filmy veil floated about her shoulders . Her face was white and her grey eyes fastened on Barney , as step by step , in the silence , she descended toward him . Gouverneur Morris , stifling an exclamation , stepped aside from the foot of the staircase . He was struck by her vivid beauty , and he noted instantly the appeal in her eyes as she came to a stop before Barney . But Douglass , standing before him while these men stared , knew that it was Joshua who protected her ; she knew as she looked back at him that had it not been for the name she bore , Barney would keep her here openly . " Sir , " she said , low , while Barney took the cape from her hand and put it around her as though to shield her from the openly appraising eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " she said . She turned her head slowly to smile at his guests , and she made a brief curtsey . " My apologies , gentlemen , for detaining Captain Barney . " " No apologies at all are necessary , Mistress Harris , " Gouverneur said quickly , bowing . Douglass put her hand on Barney 's arm . He opened the door for her . " Ah , no , sir , " she said . " My coach awaits me. - I go the way I came . " She slipped past him . There was no coach but he would n't know it , and besides that , it was only four-thirty , and not late ; it was best for him not to follow and he would know it . She ran across the  | court and out into the alley . Halfway down , against the brick walls , she stopped . Her hands were trembling a little as she adjusted her veil over her hair . The narrow alley was empty . Back in Bladen 's Court she could imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what was he thinking ? " Oh , lord , " she whispered aloud . " What have I done ? " She leaned against the wall , while her mind tried to encompass the brief thirty minutes just passed . She was alone ; the loneliness of a strange land , a strange city , a narrow empty street pressed around her . Within the window of Iog , into which she could see , the cabinet maker , a jolly man from whom she had bought a set of carved chairs , put his feet up on the settle and opened the paper . He had told her proudly that his son had been with Washington since the winter at Valley Forge . She caught her breath suddenly as she realized what that man would think if he knew what errand had brought her to Elfreth 's Alley . Was Barney right ? The image of Joshua 's face floated in front of her . She gathered her cape closely about her and walked rapidly down the alley , alone . 20 MARSTON LET HER IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Joshua ? " she asked . " In his room , madam . " She went slowly up the stairway , past her landing , and around to the big front room . From its doorway she saw the back of Joshua 's head , as he sat in his big chair in front of the fire . " Joshua , " she said . " Yes ? " He turned his head to look . " Come in , sister , " he said , smiling . She approached him uncertainly . Was that the last time he would ever smile at her ? " Are you weary , after your first day out , Joshua ? " " A little , " he admitted . He had propped his legs up on the stool , and laid the book he had been reading across his knees . His smile faded . " What 's the matter ? "  | " The matter ? " asked Douglass . She saw that his man was in the room , taking clothing out of the drawers of the highboy . Joshua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " that I am sailing for Stasia tomorrow . " That was like him , she thought . He frowned a little . " Leave us , Partridge , " he said shortly . Partridge did so , immediately . Douglass watched him go ; then she bethought herself , and she went over to the door and closed it . When she returned to Joshua 's chair he was eying her with narrowed eyes . " What 's the matter ? " he asked , curtly . " I wanted no one to hear us , " she said . " So I assumed . Your action speaks plain enough . " He laid the book on the table . " Well ? I 'm waiting . " How to begin , she wondered wildly . She sank down into a chair , a straight ladderbacked chair . " Sir , " she said bravely , " I have to tell you first . I would rather  --  than have you hear it elsewhere . I went to Bladen 's Court ! " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blue eyes icy . The words tumbled out . " I waited for Barney upstairs . When he came home , we quarrelled ; he left me for a moment to go down to tell his friends to leave . I I went down after him . " She looked across at his face . " They knew me , of course . I spoke to them . One of them was Gouverneur Morris , and one was Captain Humphreys and the others are two whose names I forget . " He said grimly , " They wo n't have forgotten yours . And why did you go there ? You omitted that salient fact . " " To see Barney , " she whispered . Joshua sat forward . " Tell me the truth ! That is a lie ! " " Joshua , " she pleaded . " I wish to know why you went there , " he repeated , " and I want the truth ! " " Joshua , " she said . " I went  --  I went to get our naval code-books ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs off the stool and stood up , forgetting the injured leg ; a knifing pain went all the way to his head , and he grasped for the top of her tall chair . Resting his weight on the good leg , he put his other hand in her thick curls and turned her face up . He spaced each word evenly .  | " How do you know about the codebooks ? " " Joshua , " she gasped . The low voice and deadly calm did not deceive her ; he was pale with anger . " From your dear friends next door , " he muttered , answering his own question . Blue eyes narrowed , he slowly unfastened the fingers of the hand he had in her hair . Because she was afraid of him physically , she cried out and put her bright head in her hands . Joshua raised his open hand . " You would , would you ? " " Joshua , " she cried , " it was n't the men next door ? " She stopped . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her body braced for the blow that was coming . But it did n't come . He stepped back . And through his mind went suddenly and vividly the struggles that had confronted Barney and himself not only to lay hands on a ship but to finance her ; through his mind went the whole day just past , when men were making every conceivable effort to win ? " You 'd jeopardize it all , would you ? You can look at me , madam ! You do n't need to hide your face ! Much as I 'd like to ? " He took another step backward to his chair , and sat down heavily . Douglass shivered with relief , and raised her head slowly . But when she saw his face , she knew it would have been better if he had struck her . " I would n't have minded , if you had , " she said tearfully . " I might have broken your goddamned neck , " he said . Then he smiled grimly . " Oh , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse  --  she was sure of it . Her eyes fastened on him . " I confess I find this difficult to credit , madam . Not only aid and comfort to the enemy , but outright treachery ! " These words , almost calm , did not deceive her either . She moistened her lips . " You would have stolen  --  from three hundred and fifty American officers and men , including Barney , what may offer thern some slight protection against the whole damned British fleet now stationed in the West Indies ! Rodney sailed from New York today , with eight sail of the line , and numerous escort ships . He meets with more , at his West Indian station . You wished to add to the odds ? " " Rodney sailed ? " she asked and fear smote her . " I did not know , " she whispered , and she looked at him with her grey eyes and waited , because he was speaking .  | " Does n't that please you ? " he asked , with sudden force . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where you belong , and God forbid me from keeping you here against your will ! " It was her turn to stare unbelievingly . " You  --  you are sending me  --  back to England ? " " Indeed not , " he said . " I have no money for passage ! Another of my vessels leaves next week . I shall make arrangements for you to sail on her , as far as Stasia . " " Stasia ? " He smiled grimly . " The men at Stasia wo n't bother to enquire about your politics , madam ! " " Stasia ? " She rose and steadied herself on the chairback . " It is hardly my fault , " Joshua said evenly , " that the most lawless port in the world is the only one by which you can reach England . See the British resident , upon arrival , or seek aid from the Governor . As a distressed English refugee , you should arouse deep sympathy in the breasts of the men in port . " She flushed deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoldering anger burst through his tones . " I do n't want to hear it ! Now get out ! " There was nothing for Douglass to do but go . Joshua stared into the fire . She had deliberately worked against all for which he had striven for so many years . It flashed across his mind that last year the Cabot firm in Boston had had twelve vessels ; now they had none , through the activities of the Navy she was so interested in aiding . A blasting oath came from his lips and he stood up . He limped over to the table as fast as he could and poured himself a glass of whiskey , which he drank off standing there . How had she dared ? His leg hurt . Then the gross ingratitude occurred to him . Partridge , coming down the hall , heard his master swear again . Partridge saw that Lucie was standing at the door , ready to knock . " Do n't ! " He shook his head warningly , but it was too late . Within Joshua heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open so that it crashed back against the frame . While the sound died away , Joshua glowered down at Lucie . " You come from madam ? " he growled . " Oui , " said Lucie , shaken . " Is she too afraid to come herself ? " " Oui , " Lucie faltered .  | " She shows wisdom . By God , my decision is final ! Convey my message ! " " Oui , m'sieur , " said Lucie . " But that is not what I came to ask . " She drew a breath . " S'il vous plait , rn'sieur . " Joshua 's leg was now paining him considerably . He saw the bed was nearest , and he went over slowly and sat down , stretching out the leg , his hands touching around the wound gently , rubbing the aching muscles . " What is it ? " he muttered . She looked at him . " I am sorry sir , " she whispered to his bent head . " What for ? " Joshua muttered again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madame ? " He looked up . " Get on with it ! What do you want ? " Her face was white . She was the daintiest woman he had ever seen . From the small slippers with their ankle ties , to the top of her shining head , she was lovely . " I 'm sorry , Lucie , " he said gruffly . " Tell me . What is it ? " The curling lashes swept up as she raised her yes . " I sail with madame ? " There was silence . Joshua did n't answer . In trepidation Lucie waited . Finally he said , " Yes . " Her knees trembled . Was he sending her away , too ? He was speaking further , and she listened fearfully . " Madam " ? he grumbled over her name even ? " should be accompanied . But you will be escorted from the ship  --  you do not sail with me , you know . I sail tomorrow . But I will leave orders that you are to be escorted to the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall see you . If I am not in Stasia when you land , wait . Do you understand ? " Her relief was great . " Oui , m'sieur . I wait . " " Un moment , " he said , and smiled a little . " In Stasia , a woman does not go about by herself . Most especially in Lower Town . That is for men . Men only . " " Oui , m'sieur . I shall not . " " Remember . " He said , then , " Au revoir , Lucie . Goodnight . " " Goodnight , sir , " she said softly . Then she was gone . She had left the door open . Joshua saw Partridge peering around the edge of it . " Partridge , " he snapped . " Fill me a pipe . And bring me that bottle . "  | PART THREE-S PASIA 21 IT WAS TEN MINUTES BEFORE SIX A.M. MR . SCULL , FIRST LIEUTENant of the " Athena , " stood on the lee side of the quarterdeck , hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were holystoning the deck ; the quartermaster , both brown hands on the wheel , was within a yard of him , and Mr. Jerrell , just turned twenty and a junior lieutenant , was at his side . This much was usual ; the rest was n't . With misgiving Mr. Scull heard Barney 's voice come singing down from his position atop the fore topgallant masthead . " Three points to starboard , Mr. Scull ! " The wheel swung . Jerrell and Scull both turned their heads to look at the shoreline . Scull muttered , " Jesus God , we 're running right under those goddamn guns . " Jerrell shoved his cap back on his head . " If we do n't get away with it , we 'll be sunk , sir . " A soft Scottish brogue answered him as Mr. Macgregor came up from behind . " Ye never said a truer word , laddie . " He thrust his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels to survey the rocky shore that rose from its white line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves up to the walls of the white fort that overlooked the entrance to the roadway . " You can take it from me , " he said softly , " that we 're within range . " He patted Jerrell on the shoulder . " Watch for the puff of smoke from those big babies . " He went on down the gangway , coming to a stop before two runout guns . He looked down at the heads of the crouching gunners . " You 're not nairvous , are ye ? " he jibed . He stood there , watching , not hearing Barney 's soft tread . Barney came to a stop beside him , looking out over the blue water at the ship that was trying so desperately to escape them . Barney gave a brief glance to the shoreline himself . They were running between this quarry and the high-  | perched fort , cutting off the English ship from the sanctuary of the harbor to which she was running . Macgregor said , " This man is Limey , sir . He 's usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barney looked down at Limey 's hunched shoulders and the badly scarred back . He was one of thirty English seamen who had volunteered , out of prison , to serve aboard the " Athena . " Two days out , Limey had been betrayed by a fellow Englishman , who reported that Limey was plotting to retake the " Athena . " " Limey do n't talk much , " Macgregor went on . " It takes the cat to make him talk . Then he speaks quick enough . " Barney knew that this was not true . It had taken severe pain and a long time to make Limey tell the names of the men who agreed to throw in with him to try to recapture the " Athena . " He had stood the flogging long and without a sound until finally Barney had had to stop it . Barney still felt traces of his own perturbation as he had approached left quarterdeck and the man tied to the grating , as he had taken the bloody whip from the seaman who had wielded it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping the man could hear him , " I do n't like to see a man flogged to death . I 'm going to give you plenty of chance to die at your post behind your guns . I want the names of the men who conspired with you ; they 'll get twenty lashes apiece . Otherwise I shall be forced to use this treatment on all your fellow Englishmen . Are you ready to talk , Limey ? " It was with terrible relief he had heard a muttered , " Aye , aye , sir . " Barney addressed him now , via Macgregor . " Mr. Macgregor , I want a shot across her bows , near , very near . " Limey glanced up at Barney , who stood right alongside of him . He sighted down the gun , he elevated her a little , the muscles rippling across his naked back . The gun roared . It was a perfectly aimed shot . It arched up very slightly , clearing the bow of the trapped merchantman as a good tennis shot clears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limey straightened up , sat back on his heels ; he gave another look at Barney 's face , saw the smile , and smiled too . " Thank you , sir , " he murmured . " You scared the hell out of her , " said Barney .  | It had . She was coming about obediently , in the face of the " Athena 's " eighteen-pounders . Her flag came down . And the guns of the fort remained silent . " Very satisfactory morning 's action , Mr. Macgregor , " commented Barney . He went aft slowly , to take his place on the quarterdeck . He noted that Scull and Jerrell were still glancing around at the fort . The distance between the two ships was fast narrowing ; the " Athena " was looming up alongside her prey , her guns bristling as she bore down . " She 's the Falcon , ' sir , " Scull said , squinting through the glass . " She 's hoisting out a boat , sir ! " She was lowering a boat . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falcon " itself hove to and rested quietly beside her captor . Barney said , " I 'll lay you a guinea the word her captain says is : This is piracy ! ' " Scull grinned . The boat was alongside . The English captain 's head appeared next and then all of him . He strode toward the quarterdeck and up to Barney . " This is piracy , " he announced grimly . Scull could not suppress a smile . Barney bowed . " Indeed ? " The Englishman gestured to the fort . " Under the guns of Fort Oranje , " he said . " In neutral waters , sir ! " " If we had been within range , the guns would have fired , sir , " Barney said , lazily . " That is a lie ! " Barney sighed . " Sir , it could also be a difference of opinion . " Jerrell tried not to smile . There was nothing he liked better than to hear his captain 's conversations with prisoners of war . " We shall put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor will decide . " " The Governor ? " asked the Englishman with sudden passion . " Yes , " said Barney . " We shall lay the matter before Governor de Graaf . I believe he may decide we were without the jurisdiction of a neutral port . " " You damned Yankee pirate , " the Englishman growled . Now cold , he said , " I am Captain Johns , sir . " Barney bowed . " Captain Barney , and my officers , sir . " He introduced them quickly , while Johns endeavored to control himself . When finally Johns felt he could speak without passion , he said :  | " This was a flagrant violation of the law . We were in neutral waters . " " We shall lay the matter before the Governor , sir , " Barney repeated curtly . " Mr. Scull , you may take possession of the Falcon . ' " " Aye aye , sir , " said Scull , looking alert . Johns clenched his hands . " I am ready to give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " It shall be accepted at six o'clock this evening . " The other flushed a deep red . " Until then , " said Barney easily , " I shall be forced to regard you and your officers as prisoners of war . " Johns laid his hand on his sword at this Yankee impudence . " You have the gall to let the matter go unreported all day ? And to hold me aboard ? " " Escort the gentleman below , Mr. Jerrell , " Barney said . " And to relieve your mind , sir , I 'll report it . " He bowed and turned his back . He was damned hungry ; he had had no breakfast . He would see to that now . Jerrell came out on deck again and went over to the rail . He had never seen Stasia . The great cofferdams stretched their arms on both sides to protect the blue roadway in which at least a hundred and fifty ships of all nations rode quietly at anchor . Even from here he could see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that less perishable goods were stored on the beaches temporarily , as they were in process of being moved from one ship 's bottom to another . Mr. Jerrell reflected that here warring nations traded , so their mercantile houses did business they kept on making money and paying taxes for the upkeep of their wars . It was very complicated . He turned blue eyes on Macgregor . " I 'm glad I 'm just a sailor , sir , " he said . Macgregor rolled the fat cigar in his mouth over to one side . " You could retire for life on what you 've made this voyage , laddie . " Jerrell said , slowly , " We had only two guns loaded . " Macgregor grinned . He shook his head and gestured toward the fort . " Captain was taking a chance the fort would n't fire on the stars and stripes if we fired only once . " " Then the Englishman should have known we could never have come to actual blows ? " Macgregor thought that a foolish question . He sucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbluffed him . "  | He was squinting across the water at the " Falcon , " whose courses were set now . " Scull 's sending a boat back , " he remarked . The officer of the watch , Mr. Lang , had already noted it , and stopped in the middle of a shouted order . " Avast there ! " he bellowed , and went over to the gangway . The " Athena 's " crew was all on deck ; the men hung over the sides to watch . Two wooden boxes were handed aboard . " Well , bring ' em aft , " Lang shouted . " Hands to braces ! Bo'sun , where the hell do you think we 're going to anchor ? Here ? " The courses were unfurled and caught by the strong wind ; the " Athena " heeled . " Hard aweather ! " roared Lang , harassed . He knew this would bring Barney out on deck . He glanced up at the tops . One man sat perched unconcernedly on the end of the mizzentop yardarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The two seamen stood holding the boxes . " Set them down ! " " Mr. Scull said , sir , these here were for the captain , sir . " " Set ' em down , " Lang shouted . Macgregor lounged over and looked . He leaned down and opened the little hinged door at one side of the box ; he withdrew his hand hastily . " He bit me , by God , " he said , looking at his finger , while the occupant of the box scuttled out the open door . At this moment Barney appeared . " What 's going on , Mr. Lang ? " he inquired , looking around the ship . " Ca n't you get sail up without sending my breakfast on the deck ? And what are those boxes ? " Macgregor grinned . " Turtles , sir . " " Turtles ? " growled Barney , and saw one . " By God , Mr. Lang , are you running a circus out here ? " " No , sir , " said Lang hastily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " That 's Lord Sandwich over there . " He pointed to the turtle who faced them , his tail waving . " He 's got Lord Sandwich ' carved on his shell , sir . He 's a present for his lordship , I guess . Mr. Scull sent them , sir . Shall I see who this one is ? " He gestured to the other box . " Mr. Macgregor , " said Barney , " get that goddamned turtle off my quarterdeck . Mr. Lang , if you spill another cup of coffee on me , you 'll get no shore leave . " Macgregor said , " Aye aye , sir . " He started toward the turtle . Barney had stopped in his stride . This promised to be good . He grinned .  | " Well , Mr. Macgregor , maybe the turtle will reverse the usual order and have you for dinner . " " He already has a bite out of me , sir , " Macgregor said , approaching the big snapping turtle warily . He reached out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Macgregor , " snapped Barney . " I want him alive . " " Aye aye , sir , " muttered Macgregor , eying the turtle , which stared back . Macgregor made a feint at the turtle , which snapped viciously . Macgregor made another pass at it ; this time the turtle withdrew his head . Macgregor dropped the belaying pin and grabbed for the turtle ; he almost succeeded in shoving it in its box before the turtle decided to bite again . Macgregor yelled , and slammed the hinged door . " Not many men get bitten by Lord Sandwich , sir , " he said , regarding his hand . Barney laughed . " On second thought I 've decided to let you discover the identity of the other turtle , Mr. Macgregor . Find out and report to me . " He started away . " Yes , sir , " Macgregor said , wiping the blood off his hand , while Lang said : " I 'll thank you not to drip blood on the deck either , Mr. Macgregor . " Macgregor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said goodnaturedly . Jerrell , who had stayed out of the way , came to his side . " I 'll help , " he said . " Lord North , " they both cried together , as they slammed the door closed again . Macgregor got to his feet . " Here we are , putting into Stasia , with both their lordships aboard . " " Get the heads'Ls off her , " shouted Lang . He turned and flashed a smile at Macgregor and Jerrell . " Stasia tonight , " he said . 22 THE TOWN 'S OFFICIAL NAME WAS ORANJESTAD , BUT NO ONE EVER called it that ; they called it Stasia , and Upper Town , and Lower Town .  | The whole island was but three by six miles . It was an extinct volcano , whose black crater , cold , thrust upward almost in the center of the island , and was called the Quill , or Signal Hill . Its rocky wooded slopes descended directly into the blue seas ; the trade winds fanned it . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names that reflected its conquest and reconquest . On top of the island , in English Quarter , and Corcoram , and White Cliffs , were the spreading homes of the wealthy merchants . The road dipped down to the sea from the town that perched precariously on the slopes . The houses were wooden , and painted white . In Upper Town was the Dutch Reform Church , the hospital next to it , the Fort that overlooked a steep cliff ; lodging houses ; houses of planters , few as they were , government workers , officers , more merchants . There was no Negro quarter . Most of the seven hundred slaves on Stasia were household servants and attached to the houses of the rich , for there were few plantations to work . Douglass ' chair was carried by two slaves from the Governor 's mansion , which stood high on the hillside in English Quarter . She passed along under the shadow of the Amsterdam Fort , down a narrow tree-lined lane , past white fences and white houses , crowded close , past the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was looking down the street into Lower Town . The way down was so steep that great ships ' anchors were sunk in the road ; tackling was used to raise merchandise , and the anchors were used to fix purchase to . Great warehouses stretched , literally a mile long . Below her were the shops , exactly a mile of shops . Enormous auction houses ; from here she could see over the tops of them . Way below was the beach , jammed with crates ; like two great arms the cofferdams protected this cupped trading post and the shipping cradled between the man-made walls . The sea was not so heavy today . A good stiff breeze in Stasia meant lighter surf ; even the sailors did n't know why . Douglass ' bearers stopped . She could go no further , for Lower Town was male , except for ladies of pleasure . She peered from the window with undisguised curiosity . The street , descending rapidly , was busy ; uniforms and dress of every nation in the world were represented here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from Lower Town ; Douglass was sure she could . Tavern signs , shop signs went down like steps . Men passed in and out of them ; laughter floated up to her , the crack of a pistol shot punctuated the air . By one of the big anchors a drunk lay , and men went on around him , unnoticing . Up this street Barney would come , for it was the main road from the landings . A woman in a chair with four bearers went past Douglass and down the steep street . Douglass had a glimpse of diamonds blazing in her ears , on her hands and around her neck . " I wish I had fifty guineas , " yelled an English voice , after the chair . The woman put her head out . She had a French accent . " It would cost you one hundred , Limey . " Douglass leaned out of the chair to listen , but there was no more dialogue . The woman was carried around the nearest corner . Douglass became aware that a man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He stared . Douglass retreated into the chair again . After a while she peered out ; he was gone . Still there was no sight of the man for whom she waited . Joshua also might be along . She had not seen Joshua since the night he had told her he was sending her to Stasia . She wished passionately that an opportunity would offer itself by which she could prove to him that she wished only to return to the States with him , but he would be skeptical now . The trouble was that unless he came soon , and would listen to her , she would be sent back to England before she could even speak with him . She moved restlessly in the chair . She had left Lucie behind , at the Governor 's mansion . If Joshua came up the street , she wanted to talk to him alone . She kept her thoughts on Joshua . Her real hope was to see Barney . There were so many men in the streets that it was hard to see more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands tightly over her reticule . Suddenly , in front of her very eyes , a street fight exploded . In less than two minutes , at least fifty men rushed out of the nearest taverns ; they battled savagely . A window shattered ; a couple of shots rang out ; yells sounded . And at the second sound of gunfire , Douglass ' bearers fled . " Come back , " she cried helplessly , watching them take to their heels . Impelled by fear , she thought that perhaps running was the  | safest thing for her to do , and she opened the chair door and got out into the street . A Spanish sailor hurtled almost to her feet . He stumbled , got up , drawing his knife , and plunged back into the fray again . Douglass saw one man hurled back against an anchor . Agilely he flew over it in a backward somersault . " Yank , Yank ! " came the cry for aid , and after it , " Athena ! Athena ! " Douglass knew she should run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder , with amazement . Two more pistol shots cracked through the air ; she shrank back . The fighting had surged both up and down the street , and just as she was about to take to her heels , another man was spewed out of the melee almost at her feet . He got up on all fours , then stared at her . " Oh , " she gasped . " Are you hurt ? " He shook his head . " Goddamn Limeys , " he said breathlessly . " We got more Yanks now . " He stood up ; he was covered with dirt . Suddenly he reached for her . " Let me go , " cried Douglass , struggling wildly . She almost got free . In quick succession five more shots sounded . While they rang out , Douglass found herself seized hard by one arm , and swung around . Then , across ten feet of cleared space , she saw Barney running toward her . " Barney ! " she cried . Barney was right beside her , a pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " Oh , no ! " she cried , fearfully , catching at his arm , clinging to it . " No , Barney ! " she repeated wildly . The sailor was rooted to the spot right before her eyes . " Do not harm him ! " For a second Barney looked at him . Then there was an amazing rapid-fire change of expression on his face : anger to puzzlement to amusement . He took her by the arms lightly , looking down into her face . " Sweetheart ! " He smiled . Her little flowered parasol , attached by a loop on her wrist , swung between them . A disarranged curl fell over her forehead ; her sash was undone . " Are you all right , Douglass ? " he asked . " Good God ? " He broke off , and shook his head incredulously . His eyes took her in again . Then he said , " I ca n't believe it 's you . Turn around , sweetheart , and I 'll tie your sash . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for a moment neither of them moved . Then Barney dropped her arms . He watched her as she tied the  | sash . She looked so sweet ; she had fastened her black-fringed eyes on him . When she had finished tying the bow she clasped her hands and waited . He smiled and took her arm . He looked around as if to get his bearings . " We ca n't stand here , Douglass . Is this your chair ? " " Yes , Barney . " She caught her lip in her teeth . She thought of something else to tell him . " I did n't really go into Lower Town . I was waiting . And my bearers fled ! " Since no harm had come of the adventure , Barney looked amused . " Please get in the chair . " He helped her in , and spoke to the two men who were standing patiently , waiting . " You may put the box in here , Wolf . " The box Wolf was carrying was shoved in . Barney got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked the chair up . Once more Barney surveyed her . " Before we do anything else , ma'am , like kissing , you might tell me where you live . " Douglass caught his eye . " At the Governor 's , " she said . " But ? " " No buts , " Barney said gravely . " The Governor 's , Wolf , " he called . He stretched out his legs , turned toward her a little . " Wolf is my coxswain . " The chair swayed gently . Douglass sank back into the cushions ; Barney 's arm brushed hers . She knew what his next remark would be ; and it came quickly . " I gather you know I 'm amazed to see you here , Mrs. Harris . " " And I ca n't believe She said simply , " Joshua is sending me home . " He shook his head slowly , remembering . She was looking at him as if he could do something about it . " I warned you not to tell him , Douglass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words flew out . Then she was quiet , remembering herself . Once more she fastened her eyes on him . " Joshua told me to tell him the truth . " Barney smiled ruefully . " So you did . " He sighed . " And that is that . " He reached out and took her hand , turning it over in his big one . It looked white and fragile next to his ; he flexed her fingers back and forth in his . " What else , sweetheart ? " " I sail for England . " " I see , " he said . He raised an eyebrow , keeping her hand imprisoned in his . " When ? "  | " When ? " she repeated . " Why I do n't quite know , Captain . " She spoke fast , trying to still the rapid beating of her heart . " I  --  the British resident  --  I talked to him . My cousin 's cousin  --  Lord Edgecomb 's cousin  --  he owns part interest in a merchantman , the Falcon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney looked very amused . His brilliant smile flashed out . " Yes , " said Douglass uncertainly . " Why do you laugh ? " Then since he did n't seem disposed to answer and was still smiling , she asked , " And what is in the box ? " " A snapping turtle , " Barney said . " Oh , lord , " she exclaimed , drawing her legs away . Barney laughed . " I 'll save you from the turtle . The turtle has Lord Sandwich ' carved on his back , but instead of going to England , he is a present to the Governor . " Douglass tried to maintain her decorum . What was he smiling at ? " Did you have a successful voyage ? " she asked , her cool voice clipping off the words . " A bad storm hit Rodney . Nine-tenths of the fleet was disabled , including the flagship , Sandwich . ' Cordage was badly needed but American , French and Spanish merchants had bought it all up , fast . So Rodney sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about almost unchallenged . Besides that , through the clever intelligence of the Marquis de Bouille , we got a false report credited ; we spread the rumor that St. Vincents and Kingston had been leveled by the hurricane that almost leveled Barbados . Rodney proceeded on that false information and spent two weeks maneuvering only to find the island impregnable and its fortifications prepared for his attacking forces . Tomorrow I send five more prizes back to Philadelphia , including Lord North , the snapping turtle , for Robert Morris . " He paused , then continued : " Douglass , " he said , " Robert Morris ' turtle sails on the Falcon : " She turned slowly to look at him . " We captured the Falcon ' this morning . Will you write and tell your cousin 's cousin I 'm sorry ? " He grinned . " Tell me , Douglass , do you have any money ? " She lowered her lashes . " No . " Then she said , " You took the Falcon ' ? " She watched him . " Truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're fair game , and on Stasia , too . You came straight to the pirate 's lair . I even have a den to carry you to . "  | She raised her eyes . " Do n't joke , Barney . " " I have a house at White Cliffs , " he said . " I 'm going to take you there tonight . " " You ca n't , " she whispered . He said , " I shall never forget the way you looked at me when you came down those steps at Bladen 's Court , Douglass . You were asking me to let you go ; you were asking me to keep you with me . Let 's get it straight , ma'am . Here on Stasia the same situation has developed , and this time I 'm not going to let you go . Listen to me a moment . " She did n't answer and he looked over at her . " I must see the Governor now , to persuade him we did not violate Dutch neutrality . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After that I have a little business to transact . At seven , then , I 'll call for you and take you to the reception tonight ; we must put in an appearance . " She had drawn away from him , and she seemed to be regarding the field of sugar cane that stretched along the road . " It 's the Governor 's birthday , " Barney continued . " The Dutch put a lot of store in birthdays . I want you to look your most beautiful tonight . I suggest you have a siesta , too . " Out the window she could see the spreading lawns of the Governor 's home . She felt the strong clasp of his fingers over hers . His voice came again . " Do you know what a siesta is , ma'am ? It 's a nice long nap . " They were swinging quickly toward the pillared mansion , up the long drive . Three carriages stood in the crushed stone oval ; liveried slaves flanked the wide white doors . The chair was set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with him . One of his two men , jersey damp with sweat , reached in and retrieved the box . " His lordship , sir , " he said . " I 'll take him in , Wolf , " Barney said , digging in his pocket and bringing out a roll of notes . He thought that not only had Wolf had unexpected labor in carrying this chair , but precious minutes of his leave had been expended . Barney gave him two five-pound notes . " One for each , Wolf , " he said . " It 's a long climb . " " Jeez , " Wolf said , touching his cap . " Thank you , sir . " Barney took Douglass ' arm and guided her through the big doors .  | Within , the wide hall stretched and another pair of latticed doors opened for them . Barney said , " Which way is your room ? " He was carrying the turtle under one arm . " This way , " said Douglass , very low , her steps beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Closed white doors were passed , then another pair . " Here , " said Douglass . Barney reached down and opened the door . Within the room it was dusky , for the blinds were drawn against the noonday sun . Barney said , " Goodbye , then . But do n't try running away . " He was smiling , and she looked up at him with her wide eyes . " Do n't try it , " he continued . " I 'll sail in pursuit . " " Would you , Barney ? " she whispered . He nodded . He took her in his arms . " What do you want , sweetheart ? " he asked . " I 'll give you the whole damned world . What do you want ? " " Nothing but you , " she said . She leaned back in his arms . " Do n't bring me anything ! " She felt his arms tighten . He kissed her , her eyes , her cheek , her lips . Then quickly he lifted her in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He straightened and stood over her , looking down . " I warn you , " he said . With a sudden movement , she rolled over on her stomach , putting her head in the pillows . " You 'd better get some sleep now . " He turned around , picked up Lord Sandwich , and opened the door . From the bed she was watching him . " Goodbye , sweetheart , " he said . 23 WHAT I CA N'T UNDERSTAND , BARNEY , " THE GOVERNOR SAID , " IS that the British captain has n't put in an appearance . " The Governor , Count de Graaf , was standing in the center of his big study . He was short and powerfully built , with blue eyes and an almost bald head hidden under an elaborate wig . " Well , I 'll explain that , m'lord , " said Barney , smiling wickedly . " He did n't want to give me his parole before six o'clock . "  | " You bastard , " said de Graaf . " It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Barney . " Odd , is n't it ? " " Very , " said de Graaf , grinning . " What 's in the box , Captain ? " " Happy birthday from Lord Sandwich , " Barney said . " Lord Sandwich wants you to have this turtle , that was going to be a gift to him . Not wanting to depend on his lordship 's generosity too much , I intercepted it for you . " De Graaf laughed . Barney lifted the hinged door and the turtle stuck its head out and stared . The spectacle amused de Graaf ; the turtle eased out and onto the polished floor . " Lord Sandwich , " de Graaf read . He chuckled . " You crazy Yank , " he said . " I 'll eat him with relish . " " I captured Lord North , too , " Barney said . " I 'm sending him to Morris . I thought you 'd prefer the lord of the Admiralty . Hold the box , m'lord , while I shove him from the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers this morning . I came out on deck to complain and found turtles . " He snapped the door to , and stood up . De Graaf still looked amused , and Barney was most satisfied with this gift . De Graaf was so enormously wealthy that it was almost impossible to bring him anything . " I think I 'll postpone eating him for a while , " de Graaf said . " We will have a tank built for him in the gardens and show him off . Now sit down , Barney , while I give you hell . " Barney sat down ; de Graaf went back behind his desk . He picked up an inlaid gold paperweight and banged it slowly on the desk . " This island , " he said slowly , " is not dubbed the Golden Rock for nothing , Barney . It 's worth its weight in gold , like this . " He lifted the weight and set it down . " I will give you one figure , of which you are perhaps unaware . The rent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one million , two hundred thousand pounds sterling per annum . In the history of the world there has never been a trading port like Stasia . " " Granted , m'lord , " Barney said . " That is why I would look to its fortifications . " " What ? " asked de Graaf . He paid no attention . " The beaches are piled high with tobacco , rum , sugar , cannon balls . All your American correspondence goes through Stasia . Where would you trade if it were n't for Stasia ? At all costs , Barney , its neutrality must be pro-tected ! "  | " True , m'lord . " " Will you have a pipe ? " de Graaf said absently , picking up a long clay pipe and beginning to fill it . Barney rose and picked out a pipe , scooping up some tobacco from the open jar . De Graaf put the unlit pipe in his mouth . " We certainly do not need to talk about the value of Stasia to the American war . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about Fort Amsterdam . " De Graaf frowned . " Well ? " " I passed it today . The guns stick out through masses of prickly pears . Visibility from the fort is , I should imagine , about five yards . You 've allowed houses to jam in around it . More than that , the cliff wall is crumbling . If you fired one of the twenty-two-pounders , its recoil would send it dashing down the side of the cliff into Lower Town . " De Graaf lighted his pipe . " We are neutral . We do n't need guns . " Barney said , " You 're neutral ? There are two parties to neutrality . " " The verdom English , " said de Graaf , " would not go to war with Holland , too . " He thought a moment . " No . It would be too stupid . " Barney leaned forward . " Lord North , " he said , " is stupid . " De Graaf thought this over . " True , " he conceded in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Barney blew out a cloud of smoke and thought about Douglass . " No , it 's impossible , " de Graaf announced . " You 've been away from the islands , for a few years  --  since ' 77 . All are interdependent . British St. Kitts ca n't exist without maize from the States for its slaves . And so forth . But more than that , Barney . The British are hard pressed now ; the fleet is too spread out . Do you suggest that they are willing to widen the war still further ? Such a diversionary action might lose them the war on your continent ! " " I believe it would cost them that war , " Barney said . " And that would be agreeable to you ? " De Graaf bit on his pipe . " I 'm an honest man , m'lord , " Barney said . " We 've been in this fight five years . " He looked down at his hands . " According to intelligence given me by a certain Colonel Lucas , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't mention , I was told that England would declare war on you before the first of the year . It is now the end of January  --  just about time , m'lord , for the British  | fleet commanders to receive the signal to attack , to raise the enemy flags . " He got to his feet and went over to the window . " The wealth here is fabulous , m'lord . It should be protected ! " " Barney , " de Graaf said slowly , " we have received such reports for four years . " Barney turned . " I know it . That 's why I put little credence in it at that time . But once more  --  the sight of Stasia  --  the bulging wealth . And as a tactical campaign , it recommends itself . For it is so damned important to us , that I am not so sure that a great many military men would not recommend its seizure . It will work incredible hardships on the French islands , which succor the French fleets . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ammunition is transshipped here . " He was frowning . " I passed a warehouse with literally tons of cordage . The British are crying for it . " De Graaf grinned . " Forget the British . You are in Stasia . You stay long ? " " Not as long as I 'd like , " Barney said . " Now about this other matter , Barney , which you diverted me from . What happened this morning ? The British resident has been crying in the antechamber for two hours . " " That is because the Falcon ' is a rich prize . She 's loaded to the gunwales with rum , spices , brandies , silk , jewels . She was stopping here before the run to England . I caught her . Johns , the British captain , surrendered after one shot . If he had really believed we were within port waters , would n't he have stuck to his guns ? Risked getting shot up a bit ? Waited for the fort to fire ? " " Clever , " said de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that argument . If he were in close , he impugned my honor and Dutch honor by not depending on us . " Then he smiled . " It 's been a long time since I bearded the British . " Barney 's mind went back almost five years . He could see the wash of the heavy seas over the " Hornet 's " decks as she hoisted her flag and as the topmen took in the royals and tops . He could see again the many ships in the blue water of Stasia 's roadway . Over the crying of sea birds , and the sound of wind in the rigging had come the first boom of a saluting gun . There had been thirteen of them fired ? the first salute to the stars and stripes ever offered by a foreign power . Barney took the hand de Graaf held out in a strong grip . " By God , sir , I shall never forget it . "  | The Governor said , " I 'll see you tonight , sir . " Barney made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , absently , while he loaded both pistols and replaced them in his pockets . Then , shaking his head to offers of a chair , he struck out rapidly for the town . His prizes had already been given into the hands of the auctioneers ; their contents would go on the block tomorrow . That meant tomorrow night , at midnight , for the auctions were open till twelve ? there was so much business to transact at Stasia  --  he could weigh anchor . The uneasiness that bred in the back of his mind was subtle . The lure of Stasia was so apparent . He could sail at midnight tomorrow , and maybe it was the best plan . De Graaf 's words were idle , Barney was sure . He wished there were something he could do about it , but the Dutchman was stubborn , and resisted advice . There should be batteries at a number of places ; Barney catalogued them in his mind , for he knew the coastline well , and knew each bay even to its stretching fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made invulnerable ; sweeping heavy fire could envelop an attacking naval force . As he passed under the shadow of Fort Amsterdam , and saw the heavy guns through the prickly pears , he was suddenly sure that he would sail tomorrow at midnight . He was passing the cliff wall , underneath the guns of this fort that overlooked Lower Town , when behind him he heard an imperative warning cry . " Look out ! " Instinctively Barney ducked to one side . He was just in time to avoid the whistling blow of a heavy club , which grazed his shoulder and then fell to the ground . Its wielder was already showing his heels up the narrow tree-lined lane . Barney drew his pistol from his pocket , cocked it , raised it . He fired at the same time that the man who had warned him reached his side . Two shots rang out . The smell of powder was acrid . Down the lane the man fell forward . Barney and his companion ran up to him . The man lay face down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was plain that both bullets had found their mark . Barney said , " Two good shots . Thank you for warning me , de Bouille . " He leaned down and turned the man over . " Seen him before , sir ? " Francis de Bouille frowned and shook his head . The dead man wore gold loops in his ears . " Renegade sailor , hired assassin , Barney .  | Using a club because it does n't make a noise or because he has pawned his pistol . " Barney said , " If I could get my hands on the man who paid him ? " He broke off , loaded the pistol again , and shoved it back in his pocket while de Bouille did the same . " I was hoping you 'd know him , " he added . De Bouille grinned . " We never use French spies , and the man looks French . However , de Borotra has a standing offer to these renegades . Probably fifty guineas on your head , Barney . Cheap . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get here ? " " I 'm paying a visit , Barney , " de Bouille said . " Having a good time ? " Barney inquired . Then he asked , " How is Mr. Ross ? " De Bouille grinned widely . " I say nothing , Barney . I stop in his store once in a while . " " Let me ask you if you have heard anything about British designs on Stasia . " De Bouille looked surprised . " I need keep no grave face with you . We 've heard nothing but the usual . What do you know ? " " War , " said Barney . " From a Colonel Lucas . " De Bouille scowled . " Hungarian : I 've met him in Paris . Not to be trusted at all , Barney ; not at all , and not very clever , either . Probably carrying false information . Unless , of course , someone who really knows told him . " He smiled a little . " We do know the English are up to something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martinique . Preparations have been made but we may be wrong . Intelligence has been perfect so far this year ; in fact it 's been so damned good , and we fooled Rodney so badly last month , that he is going to be foxier than usual . Would you come in here ? " they were passing a tavern the officers frequented ? " and have a glass or two ? " " I wish I could , " Barney said . " When do you leave ? " " I 'm using native canoes this time . I leave day after tomorrow , at night , Barney . I 'll see you in Martinique , then . " He stopped , looked at Barney and then down the dusty street . " It 's a far cry from Paris , is n't it ? " Barney bowed elaborately . " Mes regardes d votre Pere , M'sieur le Marquis . " " You may reach Martinique before I do . In any event I 'll see you tonight . It would be lese-majeste to miss the Governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father for my release  | from this duty , which I took for fun . I want to rejoin the fleet . We do not know exactly when de Grasse comes , you know . Soon , we hope . I want you to meet de Grasse , and he desires the pleasure , immensely . " " A pleasure for me , too , m'lord , " Barney said . " Au revoir . " Once more he went on down the street . He was in Lower Town now , descending rapidly along a warehouse that seemed to be fast sliding downhill . Through open doors he went into one of the largest auctions . The smoke was so thick it was hard to see and even harder to breathe . He passed by naked blacks , ready for the auction block . The cries of the auctioneers and the answering voices of the bidders sounded . Barney was reminded of Joshua ; he could imagine him here , leaning tall and elegant on his cane , calling out in his accented voice . The thought made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw British , American , French , Greek , Irish , and Armenian merchants . At the door of the Armenian office he paused a second to look out again over the thick press of men . He remembered de Bouille 's words . It was a damned far cry from Paris . 24 BARNEY KNOCKED ON THE WHITE DOOR . IT WAS OPENED FOR HIM , and he stepped in , closing it softly . He had never seen her look so beautiful . She was dressed in white , yet the shimmering white satin was no whiter than her bare shoulders and arms . As she walked toward him , the gauzy poufs of the gown floated away from the slim shiny sheath . Her eyes were deep grey pools fringed by blackest heavy lashes ; the faintest flush on her cheeks glowing pale beside the warm red of her lips . He bowed . " I should have brought a bodyguard , Douglass , " he said with sincerity . " They will snatch you away from me . " " I 'm not afraid of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it felt cool . He stepped back to see her better . She faced him . " This afternoon  --  you did not by any chance see Joshua ? "  | The answer was brief . " No . " And even if Joshua were here " You do not understand , Barney , " she said , across the five feet that separated them . He crossed the five feet quickly , towering over her . " I think I do , " he said . " I only want you , " she whispered . He looked down at the curve of her lips as she spoke , the shadowed eyes . Then he said , " Douglass , if we do n't leave now , we never will . I would prefer you to be in my house . " He opened the door and they started down the hall . He heard her ask , in a small voice : " You mean tonight ? " " Yes , tonight , too . But I mean I want you to stay there . It 's safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two women , one a cook . They came with the house . " He guided her through the huge doorway to the ballroom . It looked like fairyland . The carved ceiling and walls were decorated with orange and citrus branches in bloom . The room opened into the gardens , and on the royal palms crystal lamps hung in upgoing spirals . The brilliant red and gold and blue of dress uniforms vied with the magnificent dress of the women . Music played . " The Armenian there measures his income in millions , " said Barney . " He runs two auctions , and owns Lord knows how many vessels . He 'll eat a bit of supper and then disappear to gamble somewhere . " Douglass stared at the jewels on the woman beside him . The Armenian bowed to Barney as they went by . " Cards later , sair ? " he asked . Barney said , " My regrets , " and smiled . The Armenian surveyed Douglass broodingly , studying each feature . Barney steered her over toward two men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potted fruit trees ; they were drinking champagne and the candlelight winked on the glasses . He said , " Those two are the British resident whom you know  --  and a British spy , de Borotra . I want a few words with them . " Douglass heard herself acknowledging their introduction . She listened to their talk . The British resident was saying : " I detected your fine hand in Governor de Graaf 's decision on the Falcon ' case , Barney . It seems that Johns impugned Dutch honor when he lowered his colors. "  | " Myself , I thought he impugned English honor , " said Barney levelly . There was a moment 's silence in which Douglass caught her breath and waited to see what would happen next . Barney had said that de Borotra was an English spy , and yet his Spanish accent was heavy . " Cowardice , " said de Borotra , " in one man reflects on all men , let us say . " He sipped his wine . " Two shots in the back of a fleeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " In case you have not yet discovered it , de Bouille and I disposed of your hired assassin . " " My dear Barney , " said de Borotra . The resident said , " On my honor , sir , I know nothing of this ! " " You bloody the fingers of only one hand , sir ? " There was another silence . Then de Borotra said to Douglass , " How long are you and Barney staying with us on Stasia , madam ? " Douglass said honestly , " Why , I do n't know , sir , " and she was surprised when Barney flushed , angered and protective , said to the Spaniard : " There may come a time when I 'll have to dispose of you myself , sir . " De Borotra acknowledged this with a slight bow . " Hurry then , Barney . We have a further charge against you now . Wearing a British naval uniform in wartime is a crime punishable by hanging . " " That 's why I issue this warning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you 'll never have the pleasure of watching me kick my heels . " He bowed and Douglass found herself walking away with him . Her fingers pressed against his arm . She whispered , " Will he ? " " Yes , " said Barney grimly . " I 've given that warning to one other man . I meant both of them ! " She stopped . In her wide grey eyes was the same look he had seen there before , questioning , unsure : He said harshly , " I 'm a rough bastard for you , am I not ? " The room seemed to recede and there was nobody in it but him . " Barney , " she said , " did you ? " " No , but only because I have n't had the chance . This is no place for you ! " He glanced about . He saw de Bouille and the Governor and Lady de Graaf . " There are the only three people who are fit for you to consort with ! I want you to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then suddenly he smiled . " I do know a few respectable people . And sometimes I behave myself . Rarely , though . " Douglass heard herself congratulating the Governor on his birthday , greeting Lady de Graaf , and being presented to de Bouille . De Bouille bent over her white fingers . He looked at her with undisguised admiration . He murmured in French that he would be happy if she would dance with him . Barney and de Graaf stood together and watched them move away . " So stunned he forgot his English , " said de Graaf . " I did not know that you were friendly with Madam Harris . " " I wanted to speak with you about her , " Barney said . " I 'm taking her with me tonight . " De Graaf muttered , " You lucky dog . " Barney had told the truth without thinking . Now he amended his words . " Madam wished me to tell you how much she has enjoyed your hospitality , " Barney said . " I am lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have convinced her she will be in less danger there . " De Graaf laughed . " I expect you 're very convincing , sir . " Barney did not smile . " Just a matter of her safety , m'lord , " and de Graaf looked askance . Then he shrugged his massive shoulders . A passing servant stopped and offered a silver tray with glasses of champagne . Barney took one and watched Douglass . He found himself waiting impatiently for the music to stop . She was engrossed in the steps , except every once in a while she would look up at de Bouille and smile at something he had said . When the music ended , de Bouille released her hand reluctantly ; her head was tipped back and she was saying something to him . Barney walked toward her fast , coming up to interrupt a sentence . She turned to see him beside her . " I would have returned madam to you , sir , " de Bouille murmured , one black eyebrow raised , with a smile . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes met Barney 's and his smile widened , whereupon he turned away . Douglass said , " Why you did n't give me time to say goodbye ? " " No , " said Barney . " I liked him , " she said . He said abruptly , " I hired a carriage , Douglass . Later , Lucie will join you . "  | They were near a huge four-shelved sideboard laden with sweetmeats from four continents . Douglass studied it . " Did you hear me ? " Barney asked . " Yes , " she said . " I was wondering if I wanted to walk around the garden . " He looked into her eyes . " Do you ? " " Barney , " she said . " I do n't know . " He took her arm . She walked at his side . He was conscious of the other men 's eyes on her ; it seemed to take more than a long minute to walk the sixty feet across the ballroom into the wide deserted hall . But once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his arm . He made a move to recapture it . She stood back against the wall ; gradually she raised her eyes . " Barney , " she whispered . He did n't answer ; he waited for her to go on . " I wanted to tell you something . " " Yes . " She spoke fast then . " When I came to take the codebooks that night , " she made a gesture , " I never thought it might deprive you of aid in danger ! It was Joshua who said it . I ? " She reminded herself thus that it had been that headlong act which had brought her here to him . " I knew that . " He waited a moment . " Is that all ? " She nodded . " Then come , darling , " he muttered , taking her hand . The doors were open , and he took her down the two shallow steps . Down the line of carriages one swung out and started toward them . She said , low , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile . " The carriage was coming closer . " Is it on the sea ? " " On the top of White Cliffs , " he said . The carriage door flew open . She got in , sitting straight . Barney sat down beside her and they started down the drive . For a moment he studied her . The time before she would belong to him could be reckoned in minutes . Because he was only too well aware of his passion for her , he said , almost curtly : " There is a maid at the house . Will you want her services ? " They had turned out of the grounds and were rolling rapidly down the high road across the top of the island . The carriage lamps swung . In their dimness , her grey eyes looked back at him .  | If she answered he never heard her . He took her in a close embrace , locking her in his arms against him . When the carriage rolled to a stop , he lifted her from it . A long flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind cried a little . Far below , the sea pounded and the restless water stretched . In his arms he bore her easily up the steep steps to the house on the rocks . 25 " M'SIEUR ! " LUCIE JUMPED TO HER FEET . " I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS you , sir ! You did n't speak and so I did n't recognize your voice . " Joshua nodded and shut the door . " I knocked , " he said , looking around past the bed and a table with a lot of bottles on it and silver backed brushes . His first feeling was vague relief that Douglass was not here . Guilt had nagged him considerably lately . He looked at Lucie . She was wearing a gay blouse and matching ruffled skirt . Her hair , instead of being braided , was massed in waves on top of her head . She had stood rapidly at his entrance , and the filmy material on which she had been sewing had . slipped to the floor in a pool of color at her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it critically as it dangled from his hand . " What on earth is it , Lucie ? " he inquired . " A peignoir , m'sieur , " she said ; her eyes shone deep blue . " It looks like a curtain , " Joshua said , holding it out . " You can see through it , " he added , and looked at the swell of her breast and the tiny waist . " Enchanting idea , " he commented , and smiled a little . " You 've changed your hair . Did you miss me ? " She looked across to his tall figure ; he was very tanned . " I assure you , " she began , " vastly . " Joshua grinned . " You 're sounding just like a lady of fashion , Lucie . " He imitated her . " Oh , but vastly ! " " You puzzle me , " she said gravely . " Should I not ? " Joshua deliberately misunderstood . " Should I not puzzle you , Lucie ? "  | Her delicate brows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I not ? " She stopped . She smiled enchantingly . " You jest . " " Oui , " said Joshua . " But if you are going to be so damned fashionable , you might ask me to sit down . " " Oh , " she said . " I beg your pardon ! Please sit down . " " You sit first , " Joshua said , smiling down at her . " Oh , " she repeated . She sighed and sat , then looked over to him . She said , " I missed you vastly . " He laughed . " I 'm glad you had kind thoughts . I imagine madam did not think thus . " He regarded the tips of his shoes . " One thing a man should learn , Lucie , is never to take what a woman does seriously . I should have bounced her over my knee and whacked the hell out of her . " Having thus delivered this , he felt better . " I suppose she told you , did n't she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble was that I lost my temper completely . " " Oui , I know , " said Lucie very soberly . " Well , Lucie , where is madam ? " Lucie hesitated . " Well ? " Joshua said . Lucie took the wrong stitch . " Madam is with Captain Barney . " Joshua pondered this . " I gather from the tone of your voice that your sentence is supposed to have deep import . It 's almost noon . Out with it , Lucie . I gather you mean madam did not return from the ball last night . " " Oui , m'sieur . " Joshua got to his feet and went over to the long French windows . He swung around . " Has madam communicated with you ? " " No , sir . " Then she said , " She loves him , sir ! So much ! " She could not tell what he was thinking . Finally he said , " I came for two women , and have only one . " He came back to her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucie . " Then he added , " I have your gold for you . But I ca n't leave you here . Impossible . " He glanced around the luxurious bedroom . " God Almighty , " he said to himself , then he looked at Lucie again . She said , " Madam will let me know , sir . " " I 'm aware of that , Lucie . It 's whether you should be permitted to follow madam , and ? " He broke off . Lucie tried in vain to keep her mind on the sewing . She said , " Oh , sir , what are you thinking ? "  | She was surprised by the vehemence of his answer . " God knows ! I ca n't be developing morals at my age . I 'm thirty , you know . How old are you , Lucie ? " " Eighteen . I 'm old enough . " He laughed . " I 'm sure you are . But I thought you were seventeen . " " I 've had a birthday , m'sieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When ? " " On Christmas day . " " That settles it , " he said . " You 're a Christmas present . " She stood up . " Please tell me what you 're thinking . " He said , " If I did , you 'd slap me . If you did , I 'd toss you on that bed there . Does that answer your question ? " He looked down at her . " Red-haired women have such white skin . Now listen to me , Lucie . I 'm no man for you . You 're too damned sweet ; my intentions are not honorable . I 'm going to send you back to the States and you can marry George . " He thought her eyes turned deep purple . Slowly she shook her head . " No , " she said . Joshua looked at her closely . " You would n't enter a convent , would you ? " he asked anxiously . " No , " said Lucie . " But I do not marry George ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Joshua said . She said , " You decide everything for me ! " " Damn it , " said Joshua . " Shall I let you decide , then ? " " Oui ! " " All right , " he said angrily . " Decide . " She turned away from him . " I must think , " she whispered . " But most of all , I must pick my own man . " She put her hand on his arm ; she looked up into his eyes . " Madam did . " Joshua removed her hand from his arm . " Look , Lucie , I have no business fooling around with you ; you 're in my care . I 'm going to take you home with me and find you a good husband . And that 's that . " He picked up the swordstick he had laid down on the bed . " Now , you may decide what you wish . We sail tomorrow . " He went to the door and opened it  --  was just about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but instead he bumped into de Bouille . Both men apologized hastily . Then they looked at each other . They both said their names at once . Then de Bouille bowed , and  | announced he had a message for Mademoiselle Lucie . Joshua was about to go on , when he decided he had better stay . He followed do Bouille back into the room , as de Bouille handed the note to Lucie . " Captain Barney gave it to me , " he said . " I believe I 've heard Barney mention you are one of his very good friends . I , too . " He smiled . Lucie was reading rapidly . She looked up from the letter . " Captain Barney says , sir , that I am to go to madam tomorrow and bring her things ! And stay with her ! " There was deep silence . De Bouille looked from one to the other as both Joshua and Lucie faced each other . Finally Joshua said , " You may pack madam 's things . You may pack your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go back home ! That is final ! Come on , sir . " He strode to the door , and de Bouille followed him . He followed him down the long hall , and outside . Once there , de Bouille permitted himself to smile . " Would you care to ride down to Lower Town with me ? I thought  --  a little dinner , a little wine ? " Joshua grinned . " I 've been looking forward to a free day for some time , sir . I 'd be glad to go . " 26 DOUGLASS WAKENED SLOWLY . HALF AWAKE , SHE REACHED OUT with her foot toward the other side of the bed . She felt nothing but smooth linen . She sighed . " Barney , " she whispered . There was no answer . She turned on her side , opening her eyes . He was not there . But she was suddenly conscious of rapid footsteps . Quickly she rolled over and buried her head in the pillow . The door opened gently . She waited . But the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the sound of the blinds being raised . She sat up . Brilliant sunshine flooded the room . A small Negress turned from the windows ; as Douglass regarded her she made a small curtsey . " I am Esther , madam , " she announced . " It is after one o'clock . " " Oh , " said Douglass . Her hair fell over her bare shoulders . " One  | o'clock ? " she repeated . " Oh , you should have wakened me before ! Suppose ? " she looked at the white door ? " suppose he had come ? " Esther smiled . " He will not come yet , madam . Captain Barney left a message he would be back at two . " Douglass heaved a sigh . Then she smiled back at Esther tentatively . She said , " What do I ? " she paused . " First I would like a dish of tea , Esther . " " Yes , madam . " They were both silent for a minute . Douglass looked helplessly at her ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . Then she recovered herself . " Will you fetch me hot water , Esther ? And hand me a big towel , please . " Esther complied , getting the towel from the washstand drawer . Douglass wrapped it around herself and stood up . " I 'll wait on the balcony for my tea , " she said . " Yes , madam . " Esther disappeared . Left alone , Douglass crossed the room , and went out on the small stone balcony that overlooked the sea . The sun glittered on the rolling expanse of blue water . The island of Saba rose from it , green and rocky , with its white rim of breaking surf . There was no harbor at all on Saba . Last night it had loomed up dark out of the sea . Last night . . . She drew a deep breath . The wind blew her disheveled curls . The sudden sound of the door again made her stand bolt upright . But it was Esther , with the tea . She set it down on the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaise longue and held the towel with one hand and the cup of tea in the other . It was hot . But she drank it hastily , gulping it down . Through the open doors to the bedroom she could see a big Negress helping Esther with the preparations for her bath . They laid a grass mat down first , and then put the tub on it . Douglass went back into the bedroom . By the time she had pinned her hair up on her head the bath was ready . Douglass closed her eyes while Esther soaped her back . But when she had stepped out of the tub , and had finished drying herself on the big towel , she looked at Esther helplessly again . Esther came to the rescue . " I washed and pressed your petticoat and underthings , madam . " Douglass donned them hastily . But her hair was still unbrushed 11 and ? " I can not wear that ballgown , " she announced . It was only two o'clock .  | She was sitting at the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She began to brush it . She said , over Douglass ' head , " There is a robe , madam . When I finish your hair I will get it . " Douglass nodded . " Pin that part up loosely , and let the back curls go . " She surveyed it when it was done . It met her approval . Esther held the lacy robe up for inspection . Douglass put her arms in it and looked at it . She made a slow decision . " I do n't think I 'll wear it , " she said . " I am dressed enough . I am all covered up , " she added . " Yes , madam , " Esther said . The big Negress returned and helped take the bath things away . Douglass went out on the balcony again , and sat down on the chaise longue . She sat there for five minutes , stiffly , when she suddenly and determinedly eased over onto the pillows and propped herself up . She had just finished getting settled when she heard Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet away in the doorway . He had paused to take in the picture of her lying there ; then he came toward her . She was lying in the center of the chaise . He came to a stop beside it . " Good afternoon , Douglass , " he said . " Good afternoon , " Douglass said . Barney grinned . " I 'm not going to eat you , wench . Your eyes are as big as stars . " He laughed , and sat down on the edge of the chaise . Then he said , " Move over , darling . " She hesitated . Barney looked a little puzzled , and a little amused . Douglass moved slightly , and Barney stretched out beside her and took her in his arms , tipping her face up to his . " What 's the matter , sweetheart ? " he asked . He looked into her eyes . He kissed her lips . When he released them he buried his head on the curve of her throat . " What 's the matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . " " Tell me , " he said . " I love you , Barney , " she whispered . He raised his head , and kissed the tip of her nose . She leaned back . " But why did you leave me ? " He smiled slowly . " So that is the matter ? " He pushed her back against the pillows with his hands on her shoulders . " It was an action born of strict necessity  --  my leaving . I had to attend an auction . " He was looking down at her face as he spoke , his fingers in the thick curl on her shoulder .  | " You are so beautiful . " She lowered her lashes . " I 'm not dressed , even . " He slipped his arms around her . " You 're too much dressed . I feel a lot of hooks back here . " He watched her flush a little . " They 're just the fastening of the petticoat at my waist . " Barney grinned . " That 's cheering news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled it off her shoulder . Douglass tried to pull it back up . He caught her hand . " All I want to do is kiss this little hollow in your shoulder and the strap covers it up . And there was a robe in the closet . " In between his kisses he heard her answer . " I did n't want to wear it , Barney . " He raised his head again and looked at her . " I was afraid , " she whispered , " that you might remember  --  someone else who wore it . Barney ? " She stopped . " No one else has worn it , darling , " he said easily . It was not much of a lie  --  he could n't even remember the last time he had been here , it was so long ago . " Even so , " she said , low . He looked at her steadily . " No compromise , sweetheart ? " She knew what he meant . " Only for you , " she answered . Vaguely she realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside . It was impossible to think . She loved him . " Are you hungry , darling ? Dinner is probably ready . Are you hungry ? " He nodded . He held her close but his eyes were closed and he pulled her up a little to put his head on her breast . " Sleepy , " he said . " I was up at dawn . " She put her hands on his dark head and ran her fingers through the thick hair . In less than a minute she was sure he was asleep . His head was heavy . The dark lashes lay against his tanned cheek ; she traced one finger along the black brows . His big hand still lay on her arm . She did n't move , for fear of wakening him . In the distance was the crying of the sea birds . The surf pounded . Occasionally she could smell a whiff of cooking . Every sense was alive and alert . The sight of the sea , the feel of the tropic sea air and heat on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arm , the sound of Barney 's rhythmic breathing ; the look of his face in sleep . She closed her eyes , too .  | He startled her when he spoke . He had n't moved . He asked , " Am I too heavy ? " Her eyes had flown open . " I am too heavy , " he went on , lazily , and moved his head over onto the pillows beside hers . He stretched out . From the pillows he regarded her . " I 'm used to taking quick naps , darling , " he said , as if in explanation . " Douglass , I sail tonight at one . " She repeated , " Tonight , Barney ? Tonight ? " " At the stroke of midnight , I shall be gone from here , darling . That 's the trouble with getting mixed up with sailors . I think you should " He broke off , frowning a little . She waited what seemed to her a long time . " What should I do , tell me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " This is a difficult problem , where to stow you . " " Sir , " said Douglass , " I can stow myself . " He chuckled . " On the contrary . I had already despatched a note to Lucie by de Bouille , telling her to attend you here tomorrow , and pack your things . " Douglass frowned , slightly . " You did ? " " Yes , ma'am , " he said positively . " I did . Do n't you want me to take care of you ? " Under his dark eyes , she answered , " Yes , Barney . " He intended to return to Stasia soon , in a week or less . But of course he could n't tell her that . In the meantime  --  she was looking at him with her grey eyes , her red mouth was too near . He turned over and began to kiss her , and his passion for her mounted swiftly now . As he felt at her waist to unfasten the hooks , he remembered what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her mouth , " wait for me here . Wait for me here . " 27 THE PALEST SIGNS OF DAWN WERE IN THE SKY . THE LANTERNS AT the mastheads of each ship had been extinguished for twenty minutes . On the deck of the ninety-four gun flagship " H.M.S. Sandwich , "  | Admiral Rodney stood motionless behind the helmsman , noting absently that the date on the open log was February third . The breeze was cool this morning , and he felt the rheumatic twinges in his left leg shoot their darting pains up into his thigh . He set his lips . To his side his officers were silent and watchful . The van of the fleet , under Admiral Samuel Hood , was dead ahead , the cool morning wind bellying the white sails . All ships were cleared for action . The war on the Caribbean would blaze forth today , February third , 1781 . It was singularly fitting , Rodney thought , that British guns would open it , and this fleet strike first and fast , seizing the offensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had memorized the map of the harbor of St. Eustatious . In ten minutes the dawn would reveal it to his eyes . And it might not be necessary to fire a single shot to complete this morning 's action . Already the van had passed under the guns of the sleeping fort ; within the harbor the merchant ships could hardly resist , and the few ships of war and privateers  --  they would be helpless before already runout guns of the fleet . Yesterday at St. Lucia , he had embarked a company of marines . Mist was rising now . But the skies were lighter . Mist floated over the grey water , curled around the dim shapes of the ships at anchor , curled around the distant upright Quill , as it thrust upward like a standing sentinel . Like sultry smoke , the mist gathered and blew . He drew from his blue coat a sealed envelope and handed it to the officer who waited . There were two other officers with him , and since one of them was Rodney 's son , Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stepped into their waiting boat . Then he walked to the rail . The boats pulled away fast . The roadway of Stasia was completely blocked off . The town was under the British guns . If there was powder stored in those warehouses , terrible destruction could be wrought , and the whole island could be shaken to its foundations . The Quill , which Rodney could see plainly now ? even that might shiver and shake . The twinge of rheumatic pain knifed up his leg again . Nevertheless he began to take his morning walk , up and down , across the weather side of the quarterdeck . Governor de Graaf struggled into his dressing gown , put his feet in his slippers . He opened his door .  | Red-coated British marines formed a barrier . He stalked past them , smoothing his hair . In his study he found three British officers , in their blue uniforms . One of them handed him an envelope . Dc Graaf tore it open . He already knew what it must contain . Therefore he had difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We , the general officers commanding in chief his Britannic Majesty 's fleet and army in the West Indies , do , in his royal name , demand an instant surrender of the island of Saint Eustatious , and its dependencies , with everything in and belonging thereto , for the use of his said Majesty . " We give you one hour from the delivery of this message to decide . If any resistance is made , you must abide by the consequences . " And the heavy signatures . G. B. Rodney . J. Vaughn . Governor de Graaf raised his eyes from the single page . Anger and shame blotted out thought . His great shoulders hunched ; he crumpled the paper and threw it on the floor . Then he set his heel on it . " I trust you have a copy ? " he sneered . Young Rodney took a step forward . " How ? " he began angrily . De Graaf cut him short . " I expect to be addressed as Your Excellency ! " John Rodney was speechless with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under de Graaf 's shoe . " Do you accept our terms ? " he ground out . De Graaf smiled . His voice was silky . He drew his watch from his pocket . " Using the words of Admiral Rodney himself , " he said mockingly , " I have one hour , sirs . " He kicked the note with his foot . " I suggest you read it . " He started for the door , and at the doorway he turned . " Now get out ! " He held the door open for them . One by one they filed past . De Graaf , shaking with anger , watched their blue backs walk away from him . He had an hour . But what was he going to do with it ? Joshua woke slowly . Thirst wakened him . He started to sit up and felt a throb of pain in his head . He sank back again and closed his eyes . He opened them slowly . The ceiling at which he stared was unfamiliar . Forgetting his head , he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; he realized he was fully dressed save for his  | shoes , and he turned his head to see who was in bed with him . He saw the back of de Bouille 's head . He , too , was dressed ; he was sound asleep , sprawled out . Joshua tried to remember where they were . While he was remembering thirst again assailed him . He got up and went to the elaborate table on which stood a pitcher of water . Ile poured a glass , and drank it ; he poured another glass . His head ached . But now he knew where they were . A very high-priced bawdy house . As Joshua looked at de Bouille , he grinned . He said aloud : " I hope to God they did n't charge me fifty guineas for you . " De Bouille stirred . He opened his eyes . When he saw Joshua he tried to sit up and sank back . His eyes closed . " And I was going to have fun . " He groaned , and turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't you , " he murmured in the pillow . " Do you suppose twenty-eight is too old ? " " Considering it carefully , in the light of what daylight there is , " Joshua said , " I seem to remember vaguely we were very drunk when we got here . " " Do n't make excuses for us , " de Bouille said , trying again to sit up and succeeding . He made a terrible grimace and held his head . Joshua decided to go over to the window to look out and see if 1 they were where he thought . He squinted through the glass , and then pushed the window farther open and stuck his head out . It was barely dawn . But it was light enough for him to descry 11 1 immediately the red coats of British marines , marching double file , past the corner fifty feet down and they were followed by three British officers . They filed past the corner , muskets over their shoulders , and Joshua turned from the window . " De Bouille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " De Bouille swung his legs off the bed . " What did you say ? " he asked . " You heard me , " said Joshua . He inclined his head to the corner . " They 're marching up the main street  --  a detail , ready for action , back toward the beach . They were accompanied by three officers . " De Bouille had been drinking a glass of water . He sat down on the bed and reached for his shoes . " Let 's get going , " he said , standing up . Joshua was already at the door . " I remember seeing Captain  | Black , last night ! " He raised his voice . " Yanks ! " he shouted . " The Redcoats are here . " He opened the nearest door and flung it open . A woman 's cry answered him , but Joshua had found Black the first try . " Black , " he shouted . Captain Black sat up in bed . " Are you still drunk ? " he wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come on ! " He started down the hallway , flinging open doors as he came on them . Black appeared in the hall behind him , wearing his trousers only . " Arc you serious ? " he roared at Joshua , twenty feet down the hall . Joshua turned . " Yes ! " De Bouille was standing at the top of the stairway , loading his pistol . " Come on ! " He started down the steps . Black dived back into the bedroom for his pistols , and his belt . Fastening it , he ran down the stairway after Joshua and de Bouille , and following them was another American they none of them knew . He caught up to them in the street . " Are you sure ? " he panted . He had snatched up his shirt and was putting his arms in it . " I 'm Rourke , first mate of the Salem Belle ' ! " The four of them stood there in the empty street . With a single thought they raced for the next corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw was enough . " Rodney , " Joshua said . " What a sight , " murmured de Bouille . His quick mind was recapitulating . While the others stared at the line of battleships that completely blocked the harbor , and had under its guns the only fort , he said , " What you saw , Joshua , was an ultimatum being delivered to the Governor ! Presumably we have about thirty minutes left of the probable hour they allowed him ! " Black said , " There is no escape by way of the sea ! " " No , " said de Bouille . " You two go to the beach and rouse the crews ; we 'll go through the town and arouse the Americans here ! Then make for the Governor . " He swept them all with his black eyes . " We can offer to defend the town . We can offer our services ! " Without a word Black and Rourke started down the steep street fast , raising their voices as they went . As their cry of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaches , and echoed over the water , the Dutch town of Oranjestad , Upper and Lower Town , was roused  | by the cry used five years before by an American named Revere at Lexington . Joshua could n't think of any better words . He shouted , " The Redcoats are coming ! " De Bouille took it up . They raced through the streets banging on doors , and from the taverns , the bawdy houses , from side alleys and poor lodging houses , the Americans poured . Half dressed , but carrying what weapons they had , they responded to the old battle cry . Doors banged and stood open ; windows flew up . Gunfire sounded . By the time Joshua and de Bouille reached Upper Town , they had at least three hundred men with them , and more coming . " To the Governor ! " de Bouille shouted . Five minutes had passed . At the top of the long street , leading down into Lower Town , Joshua paused for just a moment , to see the men behind him streaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleys . From here , too , he saw that already boats were pulling from the American merchantmen in the harbor , loaded to the gunwales with men . There was only one American privateer  --  Black 's vessel . As Joshua watched , he saw the first line of battleships moving closer for the beginning burst of fire . " Horses , " cried de Bouille , motioning the men on . He and Joshua ran through the garden of a lovely home , making for the stables . Within , they each seized a horse , and , saddleless , galloped out , through the garden . And once more , from astride a flying horse , came Paul Revere 's cry . " The Redcoats are coming ! " De Bouille repeated it in French , in Dutch . It was shouted out through the narrow ways , as they also yelled encouragement to the men who were following , afoot and ahorse . Every stable was looted quickly of its animals . From hastily opened windows , British officers and seamen got into the fight . Musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into the fray . But the Americans did n't stop to fight now . They pushed onward , toward the goal Joshua and de Bouille indicated . They quickly disposed of whoever tried to stop them , leaving dead and wounded behind , of enemy , of their own number . They pushed on . Meanwhile the relentless hands of a watch were ticking . De Graaf had laid it on the bureau ; he was dressing in Lady de Graaf 's bedroom .  | " Accoutre yourself finely , my dear , " he said over his shoulder as he surveyed the neatly clubbed wig that was being laid on his head . As always , he reached up and settled it himself . The whole mansion was alive with sound . Lady de Graaf turned to her husband as her maid hooked her gown . " M'lord , " she asked . " What ? " He picked up his watch and put it in his waistcoat pocket . " We shall surrender in style , " he said , and then , ears alert like a hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Across the spreading lawns , down the road he saw two flying horses ; he heard the sounds of more horses , and men . He jumped immediately to a conclusion . " The Americans ! " He stood rooted to the spot . More horsemen rounded the curve and attained the level heights of the top of the island . He saw the figures of men , running . " The Americans ! " he repeated . He crossed the room fast , seizing his wife by the hand . " We 'll greet them ! " Lady de Graaf gathered her skirts in one hand and ran too , at his side . He passed the great front doors which already stood open , and were flanked as usual by the liveried slaves . He went past them , and around and up the great state stairway , to its landing . On the landing were latticed doors opening out onto a curved balcony . De Graaf led his wife to the rail , between the white columns that rose on past and up . By the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive . Slowly de Graaf took his watch from his pocket . Then he replaced it . " We have ten minutes , m'lady , " he said quietly . She had no notion of what he was going to do . At his side was his dress sword . As Joshua and de Bouille stopped under the balcony , still ahorse , he bowed to them . " Good morning , gentlemen . " Both men slid to the ground . Both bowed to the Governor and his wife . Then Joshua 's Virginia accent said breathlessly : " We have come to help defend the island ! " " There are more of us , m'lord , m'lady , " said de Bouille , catching his breath . " So I see , m'lord , " de Graaf replied . The men were coming across the lawns ; the running men had left the road and cut through the fields of sugar cane , the lawns of other homes . They were streaming fast , leaping hedges , while down the drive pounded the horsemen .  | De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced at his wife and saw she was biting her lip , and that there were tears in her eyes . " Do n't do that , my dear , " he whispered . She turned toward him and smiled , putting her hand on his arm . But she still refrained from asking him what he was going to do . Surely there could not be any time left ! But there was . Only five minutes had passed . And about fifteen hundred men were massed in the gardens , and down the driveway Captain Black came , ahorse . He brought his mare to a flying stop under the balcony . " I 've garrisoned the fort , " he cried . " With three hundred seamen ! " De Graaf reckoned quickly ; there were eighteen hundred to two thousand Americans on the island , and most of them here . They would fall into British hands . And it was his fault . He looked past the garden , to the road . The sun shone now , on the marching marines , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yanks . " Cheering interrupted him , as the men waved their muskets , or whatever weapon they had managed to seize in their mad flight to the mansion . De Graaf raised his hand for quiet . In a moment the men would spot the British marines , coming inexorably onward . He said , " First I must tell your Captain Black that Amsterdam Fort is completely indefensible . Its guns can not be fired . " From three days ago de Graaf could hear Barney saying , " The visibility is five yards . The guns would crash through to Lower Town . " There was a swelling murmur from the massed men ; then it died away , but one voice had said clearly , " Let us try it ! " De Graaf answered this . " I can not ! There are women and children in the towns , the islands . Fort Oranje could not hold out against the heavy guns of the fleet . The British have asked surrender i of St. Eustatious and all'its possessions , goods , inhabitants . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung smartly into the drive . The Americans saw them . And de Graaf roared : " Hold your fire ! " Lady de Graaf held tight onto the balcony rail , watching this curious scene with incredulous eyes . De Graaf shouted : " They can not be harmed ; they bring a sum-mons ! "  | Slowly the Americans moved aside to let twenty Redcoats march solemnly onward , looking neither to left nor right , sun glinting on their shouldered muskets ; in perfect formation they came steadily toward the mansion . American trigger fingers itched . The three British officers walked easily through the press of men . The officers stood beneath de Graaf , with Joshua on one side and de Bouille on the other . Silence prevailed , as the marines were halted by a sharp command from their sergeant . In the silence de Graaf 's voice came again . " I accept your terms , " he said evenly . " As the Governor of St. Eustatious , Saba and St .. Maarten , I hereby surrender these islands with everything in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , one hour ago . Fort Oranje and Fort Amsterdam have been notified . " His voice died away . Then he said , " Now , Yanks ! Do what you will ! Get going ! And remember , though we were friends before , now we are allies ! " De Bouille and Joshua acted instantly . " Rush ' em ! " yelled Joshua , hurling himself forward at the first marine , his pistol raised as a club . Before the marine could shoulder his musket , he was felled . Joshua grabbed the weapon . The twenty marines , engulfed , went down in a matter of minutes . De Bouille had knocked one officer to the ground . He put his foot on his stomach and leaned down to draw the sword from the scabbard . " We always were at war , sir , " he reminded , jabbing the Englishman with the point of the weapon . Then de Bouille grinned . He released his prisoner . All the British were disarmed now ; a couple lay face down . De Bouille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ! " It was exactly seven o'clock . At Fort Oranje , in accordance with instructions sent thirty minutes before by de Graaf , the flag came down . At Fort Amsterdam it came down , too . The Americans within essayed the streets , spreading out through Lower Town , entering taverns , bawdy houses , shops , warehouses . And the first detachments of British marines marched up from the beaches . What happened next in Lower Town was to make Admiral Rodney livid with rage . His troops , supposedly , were under order to seize and padlock all stores , shops , warehouses , of this surrendered  | island . His marines and the overseas regiments were well-seasoned troops and the first file of marines passed smartly up from the beach . A musket shot felled one of their number , and their lieutenant whirled . The shot had come from the tavern he stood before . He spoke to a sergeant , motioning him to take ten men . The sergeant approached the door of the tavern and threw it open . A bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the bottle came a heavy bar chair . One of the marines grabbed the chair and heaved it through the window , taking frame and glass with it . The next second it flew back out the door again , and the marine went cautiously to the window and fired . He hit a barrel of beer , and it started to flow forth . " Free beer , free beer , " jeered the Americans within . " Come in and get it ! " This was followed by another bottle . The marines formed a line to rush the door . They pounded into the tavern amid flying bottles and chairs . Tables fell over . Glass littered the floors . There was no time to load muskets ; the marines used them like clubs , the sailors used chairs and bottles . From the Governor 's mansion , through Upper Town , more Americans had come , slipping down into the maze of Lower Town before the British could stop them . Only a brief half hour had passed , and it was but seven-thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town . Fifteen minutes later , as more marines landed , the whole of Lower Town was involved in a savage battling brawl , into which all parties plunged with vigor , aided by flowing whiskey , beer and rum , by the screams of the women in the fancy bawdy houses , where whole cases of champagne bubbled and fizzed off British or American heads . It was to last all day and into the night , and the damage ran into thousands of pounds . Not a window was left unbroken . It raged through the streets , the alleys , the houses , the bars . British officers lost control of their men within forty minutes . The brigs were not going to be large enough to hold the culprits . Nobody was going to know what to do with them . They made away with enough liquor to keep the fleet in rum for years . And nothing could stop it ; like wild conflagration , five thousand men turned Lower Town into a mad barroom brawl . All that could be said later was : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Bouille and Joshua knew nothing of what was going on in Lower Town . De Bouille had explained hastily :  | " I have a canoe at Tumbledown Dick ! " De Bouille had started around the side of the great home , through the gardens ; he looked around for Joshua . " Where the hell did he go ? " de Bouille muttered . Joshua was already at the French windows that opened onto Lucie 's room . The door was locked . He crashed in a pane of glass with his elbow , and put his hand in and opened the door . When he saw her , he said : " Thank heaven ! I have found you . " He was breathing fast . " Come with me , " he said . Without another word , he took her by the hand and out on the balcony ; he lifted her over the rail and set her down on the other side just as de Bouille came running up . He panted : " I did n't know where you 'd gone ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joshua said . " She 'll be safe there ! " De Bouille nodded understandingly . " Come on , then , " he cried . He knew very well the British marines would be swinging up over the top of the hill at any moment . " Through the sugar , " he said . They ran across the lawns . The sugar cane waved in the distance . They began to hear the sharp crack of musket fire . " Crouch down , Lucie , " Joshua said . Bent over , they entered the field of sugar cane . " We can cut through to the road , down near madam 's . " Ahead of him , de Bouille jogged . Joshua said , " Do you have any bullets left ? " " Two , " de Bouille called back . They had expended some during the sporadic fighting before they reached the mansion . Joshua was better armed . He had taken from the British marine his musket , his powder and shot . Although he had no time now to think ahead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying . He carried the musket over his shoulder , and as they ran , crouched , through the rows of cane , he felt no immediate apprehension of the future . He wanted to give Lucie into Douglass ' hands , because the British would treat Douglass with respect , and , as her maid , Lucie would be out of danger . He watched her as she ran ahead of him , lightly , her little feet flying ; occasionally she would look over her shoulder and smile breathlessly . He had n't given her time to say a word , but she had  | realized there was no time to explain and she had been ready to depend on him . " Hold on , " he said . She stopped , and he came up to her . Cautiously he put his head up over the cane and looked to see where they were . He frowned ; he had misjudged , all right ; they were still a good long way from their goal . But he could see that there was an open stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which they would have to pass to cross the road to Barney 's . Joshua called to de Bouille , who was about fifteen feet ahead , and he also stopped to get his breath . Joshua said , " Look ahead there . " De Bouille did . He sat down on the ground , and looked over to Joshua . Then Lucie said , " I could go alone . " " No , " both men said at once . De Bouille knew that this field of cane stretched all the way to Signal Hill . Then there was a narrow pass , just wide enough for one man , and then the road to Tumbledown Dick , if it could be called a road . It was a narrow defile between sharp rocks , leading a mile down to the sandy small beach in the bay called Tumbledown Dick . Then there was the sudden sound of musket fire , near by . Joshua got to his feet again and peered over the waving cane . Up the road came a company of marines , scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We take Lucie with us ! " He got to his feet . He felt no fear about taking her ; he was a good sailor , and his boat a triangular sailed sturdy craft ; he had sailed much in her , and he knew the waters , the small islands well . " This way , " he said . They started to run again , cutting diagonally through the field of cane , away from the sea road , through to the middle of the island where the Quill rose , black . They passed under its shadow , and through the pass , squeezing through , for it was grown with bushes . Then they started down the mile long steep defile to the beach . Little streams plunged down the side . They leaped them ; they waded through . They hastened , as fast as they could , for as de Bouille got closer to the beach , he began to have a vague fear . He increased his pace . Lucie was between the two men , with de Bouille ahead and Joshua behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly she stumbled . Joshua stopped . De Bouille watched him help her up . He realized instantly she had been keeping up too fast a pace . But  | he could not wait . " You stay here ! I 'll go on down to the beach . Come as soon as you can ! I 'll wait , once I 'm there . " He did not stop for an answer , but disappeared around a sharp bend in the path . There was no danger from the British here ; they would not penetrate into this wilderness now . Joshua set Lucie down on a patch of ground under a tree that leaned its branches over the path . He flopped down beside her , full length , putting his head in his arms . After a moment he raised his head . She was lying flat , breathing fast . " We ran you too hard , " he said . She shook her head from side to side , and smiled . " Do n't talk , " he said . Suddenly he frowned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at her face . " Perhaps " He was about to say that perhaps he should n't have brought her . " I had no idea the troops would appear that fast , Lucie , " he said . " Will you be afraid , in a small boat ? I 'm a good sailor , too . " " I 'm not afraid . With you . " " We got you dirty , " he said . There was a smudge on her cheek , and her round white arm was scratched , and bleeding a little . Joshua took out his handkerchief and wiped her cheek off . " We 'll bathe your arm in seawater , " he said , turning her arm over to see the end of the long scratch . Suddenly he looked into her eyes , he could feel the warm earth beneath him ; a little bit of sun pierced through the trees and shone on her disheveled hair . With a quick movement he rolled over and , his shoulders pinning her down , he began to kiss her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt her response . With a muttered ejaculation , he drew away from her . " Lucie , " he said , low ; he could n't resist , and leaned over and kissed her again , a long kiss ; then he pulled her into a sitting position , and to her feet . " We have to go on , now , " he whispered , taking her in a last quick hug . She fastened her fingers in his as they started down the path again . Joshua watched her as she walked by his side . Finally he said , " I hope to God the boat is there . " " Oui , " Lucie answered , and he smiled . The path was steeper , they pushed through onto the small beach almost before they knew it . They saw de Bouille coming toward them , from around a great rock . He said simply : " Somebody got here before we did . The boat is gone . "  | 28 " THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO DO , " JOSHUA SAID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp out here in the woods for a while . We 'll be relatively safe from the British ; they wo n't come hunting us yet . " De Bouille nodded . " I 'm going to reconnoitre along the beach , and see if there are more men ; there must be . " They had been sitting on the sand . The sea stretched lonely and vast . There was no sound but the sound of sea birds and surf . The bay at Tumbledown Dick was narrow and deep , cut between fingers of cliff walls . This little beach , sandy and shelving , would make it ideal for swimming . Way up , almost over their heads , the cliff leaned over , and trees grew , as though from the sky . Joshua said , " Do you have your watch ? " " Yes , " said de Bouille . " I 'll meet you here , at three , then , for a swim , if you can not find us in the forest . " As he spoke he wondered at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that came to mind , for this windward side of Stasia was a deep wilderness , rocky , overgrown , full of tiny little bays , on which the surf pounded . Over to his extreme right , a small stream plunged down the side of the hill . He picked up the musket , which he had laid carefully across his lap , and slung it over his shoulder and stood up . He helped Lucie to her feet . He stood there a moment , and she said : " You have plans , then ? " " Yes , " he said . He was n't looking far into the future . He knew only that there were certain things that must be done , and it might take some time . As they walked away from de Bouille , who waved goodbye , and struck down the beach , Joshua said : " First I want to follow that little stream . If we could find a place to camp near fresh sweet water , it would be best . " " Oui , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled . " You wo n't stay here long , Lucie . Only long enough for the hue and cry to die down , and then I can sneak you to madam some night . " He had no way of knowing this was going to be impossible . " We  | have plenty of powder and shot , " he went on , " but I want to try and fashion a bow and arrows , and shoot some of this game . I used to do that when I was a boy , in Virginia . " She looked up at him . " Did you , sir ? You never say anything about yourself . " She eyed him a little . " Speak more of it , please , " she asked . He smiled . " You 're a sweet wench . There 's nothing to tell except we used to play Indians . I used to be good with a bow and arrow . We 'll see if I 've lost track of it . We have to eat , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to think much . " " No , " said Joshua thoughtfully . " As a matter of fact , neither did I. I think you had better remove your shoes and stockings and tuck your dress up , and we 'll wade in and out of this stream . Walking in the water will be easier in some places . " He sat down himself , and she sat at his side . She removed her shoes , stuffed the stockings in them , and tied the laces so they swung over her shoulders . Then she bethought herself . Finally , face puckered and intent , she said , " I have it ! " She pulled a hairpin out of her hair , and gathering her skirt tight around her knees , thrust the pin through the material . Joshua nodded with approval . " Fine , " he said . The water was cold . It felt good . They waded in and out , climbing upward always . In less than half an hour they reached a tiny pool , surrounded with leaning pines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkled deep in pine needles . " Excellent , " said Joshua warmly , not believing such luck . He stepped out of the water , and looked around . An almost perpendicular hill went up , about thirty feet away . He walked over toward it . " There might be caves , " he explained , his voice floating back to Lucie . She could hear him thrashing through the thick growth of the hill , and he disappeared from sight . After about fifteen minutes she began to grow apprehensive . She could hear nothing , and she got to her feet . She started to walk in the direction in which he had gone , when she suddenly heard his voice , coming from the hillside . " Come here and look , " he called . In relief , she ran in the direction of his voice , pushing through the bushes and trees ; suddenly she was face to face with him ; he was pleased .  | " Look , " he said proudly , indicating a cave in the side of the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced . " I 've been in . " " That 's why I did n't hear you , then , " she murmured , looking into the cave uncertainly . He said , " You were n't frightened , were you ? " " A little , " she admitted . She amended the statement . " Just a very little ! " He did not smile . He said , " If I ever leave you again in a certain place , do not leave it ! You would get lost . Wait for me . " He swung the musket off his shoulder and unfastened the gleaming bayonet . " You can sit down , while I cut this growth away to let the sun in , for dryness . It will take some time . " Sun slanted through the pines . Joshua took off his coat and shirt , hanging them on a tree limb . He worked fast ; the sweat began to pour off him . But gradually he cleared the thick bushes back . Lucie had gone into the cave to explore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm . Joshua said , in between sawing away at the plant branches : " In the tropics it is imperative we find a dry place . " " I see , " said Lucie . " I think you had better start gathering pine needles , for a bed of sorts . I 'm trying to think what you could use to carry them in , I guess my coat would be best . Take it over there . " He gestured with the heavy knife . He had already cut quite a swath toward the little level plot alongside the pool . " Mon Dieu , you are wonderful , " Lucie said simply . Joshua paused a moment to look at her . " There 's a smudge on your nose . " She felt for it , brushing her fingers against her nose . He grinned . " Are you hungry ? " She shook her head . " I gather needles . " For more than an hour she passed to and fro , from the cave to the pine grove , while the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke little , . each intent on his own task , but occasionally their eyes would meet as both paused a moment to straighten up and stretch a little . " I 'll be stiff , " Joshua said ruefully . " It 's been a long time since I played Indian . " " I remember you said you were thirty . "  | He raised an eyebrow . " Perhaps you 'd better forget the rest of that conversation . I may retract it . " " Oh ? " She did not quite understand , but pushed the curling hair off her forehead and regarded him . " Well , m'sieur , I am finished . " She went to the door of the cave , and disappeared for a moment . Then she stuck her head out . " Come see , " she called . He laid down the knife gratefully and came over to her side . She threw out her hands . " Voila ! " " Merveilleux , " Joshua said , going over to the thick bed of pine needles . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's fine , " he said . " Soft ! My lord , it 's thick ; there must be a billion  --  two billions ! " " Ten billions , " said Lucie . " I 'm sure . I 'll be stiff too . " " Come here and try it , " he invited . She drew a deep breath and looked at his recumbent figure . " I do not know , " she said . " Perhaps ? " " Are you addressing me or yourself ? " Joshua wanted to know . " You will grow a beard , " she said next . " True , " said Joshua , laughing . " I 'm sure I have n't the faintest idea what is going on in your head , and you do n't either . " " Yes , I do , " said Lucie . " I should make another bed . " He laughed outright . " In one cave ? Unnecessary , wench . " He got to his feet and came to her . " We wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lucie turned away and started out the door . Joshua patted her backside , and she turned around quickly . " Now I 'll make a bow and arrow , " he said solemnly . But first he went over to the pool and splashed water and stuck his whole head and shoulders in the cool water . Dripping , he emerged , and told her to sit down under the pines and watch . " After you have rested a while , you can dig a little firepit , which I shall line with stones , " he said , whittling away on what was going to be an arrow . " Oui , " said Lucie . She looked at him and then down at her hands in her lap . It was almost three when de Bouille splashed through the stream , and stood in the little clearing . He was sniffing appreciatively , for Lucie was turning a browning bird on an improvised spit . A lazy fire burned in the stone-lined pit , and two big stones edged it to support  | the spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting the bow and arrows under the big pine , and the plaited vines that tied the bird onto the tough branch . " I plaited the vines , but m'sieur thought of it . " Joshua had fallen asleep at her side . He slept deeply , and de Bouille regarded him affectionately . " I have news , " he began . Almost as he said the word , Joshua stirred . He lifted his head , saw de Bouille . He turned over on his back , and looked up at him lazily . " You found us , " he said . " Yes , " said de Bouille . " I followed the stream . " He sat down . " I have news , " he repeated . Joshua yawned . " Out with it , man . " He too sat up , hooking his arms around his knees and regarding de Bouille . " Well , first , there must be four hundred of us in this forest . It 's a dense wilderness . What officers there are have rounded up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're catching fish for tonight . The big problem , of course , is going to be food . Considering the terrain , I think it most unlikely that the British will bother to send men in here after us . They will think hunger will force us to surrender . " He was silent for a moment , and then he smiled . " Let that be , for the present . A few men have sneaked in from Lower Town . I gather the biggest brawl in history is going on down there ; they 're completely wrecking it . As far as I can gather , they 're all drunk , and the British have completely lost control of their troops . " " Good God , " said Joshua . " I can just see it . " " No , you ca n't , " said de Bouille . " Listen . This one man was one of four Americans from the Salem Belle . ' He and three pals barricaded themselves in a bawdy house , with the women screaming upstairs . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs out the windows at them , bottles of champagne , tables ? everything . Finally the British forced them back into the dining room , one Yank passed out  --  two got hit on the head , and this man crawled into the kitchen and passed out himself . When he came to , the five marines were sitting in the dining room drinking . Before the Yank realized what was happening they got involved in a brawl with more marines . He left about a dozen marines completing the job . The house was shaking to its foundations . He stood in the kitchen doorway and fired everything in the kitchen at them , ducking behind the door after each shot . Then he left in a hurry . "  | " Mon Dieu , " said Lucie . De Bouille rose . " We 're having a meeting tomorrow morning sir . On the beach at Tumbledown Dick . " " I 'll be there , " said Joshua . " Wo n't you stay and have dinner with us ? " De Bouille had picked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of fish . I will bring you some tomorrow morning , and we can cook it for breakfast , together . I will tell Captain Black about your bow and arrow . I have seen how it is done , now . " " I 'll see you in the morning , then , " Joshua said . He was very preoccupied . Lucie kept on turning the roasting bird . Joshua stared at the ground , and drew patterns with a twig in the loose dirt . The sound of de Bouille 's steps died away ; the quiet was broken only by the birds and the sighing wind in the trees . Lucie tested the bird with a sharp stick . " It is done , I think , " she said , low . Joshua roused from his revery . " Good , " he said , and she was relieved to see him smile . He speared the bird with his pocket knife , laid it on a clean flat stone from the pool , and disjointed it expertly . Once more he speared a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , hungrily . They quarreled a little over who should eat the last two pieces . " But no , " Lucie said . " I have enough . You are much bigger . " Joshua ate them both . " I feel guilty , " he announced , through mouthfuls . She shook her head firmly . " You have bigger appetite than me . " Joshua swallowed . " Oui . " Nothing was left of the bird but clean bones . Joshua piled them neatly . " Savages use bones for lots of things , but I 'll be damned if I know what . " " They put them in their noses , " said Lucie . Joshua grinned . " I doubt if this wishbone would become you . " He stretched out again lazily . " For some reason I feel good . " " You have accomplished much . " She hesitated . " Are you going to close your eyes ? " " What ? " asked Joshua . " I wish you would close them . " She was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I wish to sit in the water . " She stopped . Then she said , " Please do n't look . " Joshua laughed . " I wo n't . " He turned over on his stomach ; the grave way she had asked him not to look continued to amuse him ,  | and he chuckled . All the same this was not a laughing matter , this situation . Right now he saw no way out for himself and de Bouille and the other Americans . But perhaps tomorrow , in the meeting , they could think of something , some way to lay hands on boats or make them . He was puzzling over this , how he could hollow out a log , when he heard Lucie say : " You may look . " He sat up and turned , wondering what he would see . He saw her face and shoulders ; they rose above the clear water ; she had evidently bathed her face for water dripped off her , and stuck her long eyelashes together in points . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Lucie ? " he asked . " I sit here long time . " " Not too long , " he admonished . " It grows late , and the evening air is cooler , and we have nothing for towels . " She considered this . " Oui , " she said . " C'est vrai . I emerge soon then . " She paused . " I tell you when I emerge . " " You mean I may look , then ? " She shook her head . " No , " she answered . Joshua laughed , and after a moment she smiled , too , dimpling . Then she said , " Allons ! I emerge . " Joshua obediently turned over on his stomach and put his head in his hands . He waited what he thought was a long time . Finally he felt her hand on his shoulder . " I am here , " she said . " So I see , " said Joshua , sitting up . She was dressed in her blouse and petticoat ; the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She held one arm up . " The scratch is better . " She was unpinning her hair . It fell around her shoulders in shining waves of auburn . " Was it not good fortune I had two combs in my coiffure ? " " Very , " said Joshua , watching , fascinated , as she combed out the long hair . " Are you Circe ? " " She had yellow hair , " Lucie said . " Mine is red . " " And red is better ? " " I think so . " She smiled . Then she sighed . She threw him a sideways glance . " Is it time to go to bed ? " Joshua said , " Yes . " She watched him as he got to his feet . He leaned down and pulled her up . She looked up at him . " I hung my dress in the cave . "  | They walked toward the cave . As they approached the entrance she said , " You 're sure it is time , m'sieur ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non . " Her voice was uncertain . They were at the low doorway . " Nous sommes arrives , " she whispered . " Yes , " said Joshua . She looked up at him with enormous eyes . Then she entered the cave . He had spread his coat across the top of the pine needle bed for her head . She lay down and put her head down on the coat . She was lying way over to one side of the bed . " I leave you much room , m'sieur . " His back was to her . He was wrapping the lock and stock of the musket in his waistcoat . He said over his shoulder , " I want to protect this . " " I see , " murmured Lucie . He turned then and saw her lying way over on the pine bed . He smiled ; he came over to the bed and knelt down . " Lucie , " he said . " Today is really no different from yesterday . At least that 's what I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " No ? " asked Lucie . He was about two feet away from her . " Listen , wench , " he said , " I 'll sleep outside . " She drew a long breath . She sat up . " If you sleep out there , you will catch cold . It may rain ; it dews ! If you get the fever , what will I do ? " " I seem to be suffering from some kind of fever now , " Joshua said . " Mon Dieu , " whispered Lucie , leaning forward to touch his hand . Then she said , " I should have made another bed ! " " That would make no difference , Lucie . Honestly . " Her hair fell over her shoulders ; her great blue eyes fastened on him . Joshua said , " I told you yesterday I was going to take you home and ? " He stopped . " Marry George ? " Lucie asked . " I can find you a better husband than George ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his face . " You do grow beard . " Joshua took her by the shoulders and laid her back on the bed , with her head on his coat . He himself settled down beside her care-  | fully , stretching out full length , flat on his back . " I 've changed my mind , " he said . His voice seemed to come from a great distance . Lucie lay still , not moving . He took her hand and placed it palm down over his lips . " Lucie , " he said , low , looking up at the ceiling of the cave , " if I sleep here , I want to make love to you , very much . " He turned over and looked down at her face . Lucie looked up at him . " You always explain everything . But you do n't need to . I understand . " Joshua grinned . " You do ? " He paused , while her lashes fell . " What do you understand ? " She did n't answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me . " She hesitated . Then she said quickly , " I can not ! I love you , m'sieur ! " She turned her head away . Joshua turned her to him . " Lucie , " he said urgently . He held her close and kissed her . After a moment he whispered against her lips , " You love me , Lucie ? " She opened her eyes to look at him . " Yes , " she said . 29 LIEUTENANT MACKENZIE SAID , " BUT SIR , THE SITUATION AS IT EXists is this . We have filled the hospitals , and the private homes in Upper Town . The jail is full ; the ships ' brigs are full . My thought is , sir , to make them clean up the mess . The streets are ankle deep in glass , for one thing ! " General Vaughn said gravely , " There might be merit in such a plan . " " The jails wo n't hold ' em , sir ! " " Disgraceful , " said Rodney coldly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said mildly , " It 's hardly possible , sir , to punish five thousand men except by docking their pay . What I do n't understand is how they had time to drink so much . " Mackenzie looked surprised . Then he remembered that he had come up through the ranks ; General Vaughn had not . " If there 's flowing liquor around , sir ? " Suddenly he smiled . " By God , sir , "  | he said , " it took twenty men to get five out of one bawdy house , after they had chased the Yanks out . " Rodney asked , " And how many Americans were taken prisoner ? " " About fifteen hundred , sir . In various stages of drunkenness . " He tried to keep his face straight . " There are five hundred more of them , sir , on the island . " " And what is your plan concerning them , General ? " " Well , sir , " Vaughn said , wondering how to sum it up quickly . " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Watts got hit by a bottle of champagne . Lieutenant Mackenzie is the engineer officer of the regiment ; we intend to leave him here at St. Eustatious . He has already drawn up plans for the defense of the island , and I 'll show you his submissions . Briefly , heavy batteries at a number of strategic spots . As for the Yanks , we have thrown up an outpost at White Cliffs , and at Signal Hill . We believe hunger , fever , so forth , will compel them to surrender . It is a wilderness back in there , sir , dangerous to infiltrate , unless there 's need . " " I agree , " said Rodney . Vaughn sighed with relief . " That 's all then , Lieutenant . " " Thank you , sir . " The lieutenant saluted . It was nine o'clock at night , and he had been besieged with duties which were not ordinarily his province at all because most of the five thousand officers and marines were either drunk or wounded . He thought that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing of the champagne which had flowed like water all day , and unfortunately was still flowing . They had not yet gathered up all the malefactors in Lower Town ; there were some hardy Yanks and British marines who were still going strong in a few sections . He was going back now with a fresh detail to try to rout them out . Within the big cabin , John Rodney faced his father . " According to your instructions , sir , the Dutch flag has been left flying . Governor de Graaf refuses to give us his parole , and insists on being regarded as a prisoner of war . " " He will be so accommodated , " Rodney muttered , and Vaughn said nothing . John Rodney continued . " We are trying to estimate the dead ? roughly about two hundred men , marines and seamen . The Americans had few of their number killed , less than thirty . The damage is going to run into thousands . " He flung out his hands . " We can  | hardly estimate it yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now we have most of the shops and stores under our control . But there was looting . " He waited for the pronouncement he was sure his father would make . His father said , " At least we have been the instrument of bringing this nest of villains to condign punishment ! They deserve scourging ! This island has long been an asylum for men guilty of every crime , and a receptacle for the outcasts of every nation ! " " That is true , " Vaughn said , and relieved John Rodney of answering . " We have been examining some of these merchants ' books you brought , sir . " He tapped one . " These two British merchants have been sending grain ' and fruit ' to Stasia , dealing with a merchant , Joshua Harris , of Harris &; Co . There is n't that much fruit in England ! Fruit ' is cannon balls , grain ' is gunpowder ! And there is a warehouse full of cordage ! We could n't buy it ! " " Lower Town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vipers that has preyed upon the vitals of Great Britain . Everything will be padlocked , including food , and doled out to the residents of Stasia . And everyone on the island will be treated as prisoners of war ! " John said , " It is an immense capture , sirs . Two million pounds sterling in the warehouses alone ! " " And had the Dutch been as attentive to their security as they were to their profits , this island would have been impregnable ! " " Condign punishment shall be meted out to every man who was engaged in these nefarious activities , " Rodney said . " As for you , John , yesterday there sailed a rich convoy of thirty sail , under the protection of a sixty-gun ship . I have detached Captain Reynolds , of the Monarch , ' with the Panther ' and the Sybil ' to pursue them as far as the latitudes of the Bermudas . " John 's ship was the " Panther . " " Aye , aye , sir , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you an hour 's leave , sir , " he said . " Now is the time for you to do your duty and make your fortune ! "  | 30 THE WIND WAS STRONG AND GUSTY FROM THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST . Spray flew from the " Athena 's " bows as she climbed the Atlantic combers . Barney said crisply : " Tell her we are the Triton , ' number forty-one . Ask her who she is . The British signal book was in his hands . The signalman worked . The answer came back . " She 's the Sylph , ' His Majesty 's cutter Sylph , ' sir , number 103 . " " One-oh-three , " repeated Barney , turning the page . " Correct . Tell her to keep under our lee . " On the page opposite the name " Sylph " was her number and her captain . " Commander Carr , " Barney said aloud , watching as they bore quickly down on the " Sylph . " Macgregor came running out on deck , buttoning his British blues . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macgregor wanted to say that the captain did , too , but he did n't quite dare . Instead he said gravely , " Thank you , sir . Blue certainly becomes Jerrell , there . It matches his eyes . " Barney turned and raised the glass in his hand to his eye . Abaft the starboard beam were three sails . There was n't much time here . He had certainly found part of the fleet for which he was searching . He went down the gangway , and amidships . The guns were run out and loaded . The matchsticks already sizzled . The ship had been cleared for action since the enemy sail had been sighted an hour ago . And the cutter " Sylph " was almost within hailing distance . Barney said , " The first man who fires , or gun crew who fires a gun before the order will be flogged as soon as he can be hauled to the nearest grating ! " He turned on his heel and went aft again , once more raising the glass to study the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were sailing full before the wind , on a north-northwest course . Now they had kept on the same course , but had taken in some sail , and the nearest ship had backed the maintop . " She 's hanging around to see what 's happening , " Barney said to  | Scull . Macgregor had gone fore and was along the line of guns . Scull knew the first sound of gunfire would bring the enemy ships upon them . To Scull they looked like a line of battleships and two frigates . He pushed the thought aside and concentrated on his task orders , which were to bring the " Sylph " under his lee , in a completely indefensible position . He kept glancing from the weathervane , to the " Sylph , " to the helm . At least the " Sylph " was obeying orders which she thought came from His Majesty 's ship " Triton . " The " Athena , " sails set , bore down on the cutter . The distance between the two ships narrowed fast . In Barney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dug in his pocket and came out with his watch . What would happen next would happen fast , or not at all . " Commander Carr ! " The cry came back immediately . " Aye aye , sir ! " Commander Carr had been watching the " Athena " for some time ; he had seen the uniforms of her officers ; her signals had been correct . The next words he heard , from only fifty feet away , were incredible . First he heard his name repeated . " Commander Carr ! You have been sadly tricked ! This is the United States privateer ' Athena ' ! " Carr stood stockstill on his own quarterdeck . And the ship " Athena " was even closer now ; thirty feet , then twenty . He heard , " Captain Barney speaking . You 'll note the red flag , sir . If there is any resistance whatsoever , we give no quarter . You have three minutes . " Barney held up the watch . Commander Carr saw the eighteenpounders only twenty feet away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless , completely helpless . The relentless voice went on . " You have two minutes , sir , to surrender , else I will sink you with all hands . " Can cried , " You give us no quarter ? " " None , " said Barney , his voice coming over the twenty feet . Carr saw his face , plainly ; he saw the watch upheld ; he smelled the matchsticks burning and pointed right at him was an eighteenpound cannon . He facedit , looking right into the muzzle . " Oh , God , " he muttered . " You have one minute , " Barney said , the red flag fluttering from his hand . " Else I sink you , sir . With all hands . "  | Carr could not stand it any longer . He said , his voice strangled , " We surrender . We surrender ! " The " Athena " was almost touching the " Sylph . " " Irons , " cried Barney . The men were ready . The irons swung out . The " Sylph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the marine officer , swung over to her quarterdeck , pistols in each hand . " Do n't touch that flag , " he roared , as a British sailor started to haul on the ropes . Men swarmed aboard . Barney was taking no chances . He watched with approval as Lang and Jerrell and Macgregor took charge . In less than two minutes the English crew were mustered on deck . Their knives flew overboard . Barney leaned on the rail and spoke to the commander , who stood on his own deck , dazed . " You had n't even broken out your arms chests , had you , Commander Carr ? " He did n't wait for an answer . He turned again , and raised the glass . The other three ships were still on the same course . It was possible he might get away with this . By the time he turned back to the " Sylph , " Macgregor was swinging aboard the " Athena " again , and coming aft to report . " Crew confined , sir ; Mr. Lang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Jerrell is escorting the captain and officers aboard the Athena . ' " " Very good , Mr. Macgregor , " Barney said briefly . He watched Carr come aboard , followed by his officers . They came slowly up to Barney . They offered their weapons . Barney motioned to Scull . " Take these men below , Mr. Scull . " They looked abashed and hopeless . Barney said , " Fortunes of war , sirs . I 'll send you in a couple of bottles of rum . Drown in it . Just a moment , Commander . What ships are those ? " He gestured . Can knew . He spoke without thinking , for he was praying they would sense something amiss . But as his eyes took in the " Athena " ? she looked British ! He answered Barney 's question . " Those are His Majesty 's ships Monarch , ' Panther ' and ' Sybil ' ! " He turned . " You 'll excuse me , now , sir ! " " Gladly , sir , " said Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers kept glancing back at Barney . " Yes , that 's he , sirs , " Scull said . He could n't help grinning widely . He added , " I 'll send the rum Captain Barney ordered . "  | When he returned to the deck , the " Sylph " was already hauling away , Lang waving from the quarterdeck , and the British flag still flying bravely . Not a shot had been fired . Aboard the " Monarch , " Captain Reynolds was frowning deeply . Across the heaving water , he watched for signals from the " Panther , " who was relaying them from the frigate " Sybil . " When he received the signal he was even more puzzled as to the correct decision . He was under orders to intercept the Dutch convoy , of thirty sail of merchantmen . Convoying them was a sixty-gun Dutch ship . The " Monarch " herself boasted seventy-four cannon ; the " Panther " thirty-six ; the " Sybil " thirty-two . But Reynolds had not an hour to lose . The Dutch had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue beyond the latitudes of the Bermudas . He would have to beat to windward , and consume precious time in order to see what ship was hauling away to the south as fast as she could . He swore under his breath . But he thought his duty was plain , because he was pretty sure he knew what ship that was . He gave a brief order to the signalman , to be relayed via the " Panther " to the ship nearest the stranger . The signal was read quickly . The " Sybil 's " captain , Rutherford , looked up at weathervane and sails . He gave a brief order . Then he said , to his first officer : " Hands to dinner , Mr. Jowett . " High on the mizzentopgallant masthead Barney fixed the glass on the " Panther . " He saw the signal . He saw the " Sybil " change course . He lowered the glass and came down onto the deck . Once there he consulted the signal book . He left it open , on the binnacle head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of the sails . " Hands to braces , Mr. Scull , " he said . " I want to change the trim of the sails . Lay your course north-northwest . We 'll need the wind at our heels . " Macgregor had been watching the " Sybil . " He blurted , " I thought we had fooled them , sir ! " Barney said , " If we 'd kept on our course , she would have been able to come about and have the weather gage , Mr. Macgregor . " Macgregor swallowed . " Is she ? " Barney tapped the signal book . " If I 'd had those orders , I 'd do just as she did . " The thought made him ponder . Macgregor looked  | down at the book , and where Barney 's finger pointed . He read three brief words : " Engage the enemy . " Barney 's voice was going right on . " Hands to dinner , Mr. Scull . " There was time to eat . What was coming was a ship-to-ship battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met , he would still have the weather gage ; he had it now ; and he would keep it . It would probably mean the difference between defeat and victory . He paced the deck , back and forth , back and forth . The crew came up from dinner ; they were talking and laughing . It made Barney smile a little himself . He had trained them well , but baptism by fire was coming now . It had been years since a British ship of the line had hauled down her colors . The battle about to be joined would be bitter , long and bloody . And only a few of his crew were aware of it . The officers knew , well enough . Except perhaps Jerrell . Barney found himself hoping nothing happened to him . Then he said , " Perhaps you had better escort our prisoners to the cable tier , Mr. Macgregor . And remove that uniform , sir . I doubt if you 'll need it again today . " Once again he looked down at the signal book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He decided he had better get out of British uniform himself . Carrying the book , he made his way to his own cabin . 31 THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE SUNSET WAS FADING IN THE DARKENING sky and the " Athena " was alone on an empty sea . The battle which had lasted four hours was over . It was difficult for Mr. Scull to hear the first order Barney gave him , almost the same second as the " Sybil " had exploded and sunk . The vision of it was imprinted on Scull 's mind ; the mighty roar , the flash of a sheet of fire , extinguished quickly by the lapping water that had seized the " Sybil " and drawn her down . And Scull could n't hear well because his ears were deafened by the continuous gunfire . Barney repeated sharply : " Hoist out a boat to pick up survivors ! "  | " Aye aye , sir , " said Scull , wondering dimly if they had a boat . " Lower a boat to pick up survivors , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the empty waves where the " Sybil " had been just a few seconds ago . The sight of a man in the water brought forth a yell ; the boat crew , acting instinctively , worked fast . Marines still clung in the tops and held muskets motionless along the rail ; the gun crews sat back on their haunches , ears ringing ; they would n't need the cannon balls piled beside them ; stale smoke and powder smelled acridly . The boat was lowered , pulled away . Voices called out to the boat crew , in instruction . Topmen clambered high to look out over the waves for a sign of other men struggling in the water . All their energies now were directed at saving the few survivors who had been shooting at them , and who were now at the mercy of their mutual foe , the restless sea . Barney let them go . He let them watch . There would be no rest for men tonight , but they could watch until the last of the " Sybil 's " crew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Jerrell 's voice , fore , telling the cook to hurry and get fires started . Barney was conscious of the sound of the pumps . His eyes went over the " Athena " slowly , marking her hurts ; damage below had been sustained , but it was still under control . Macgregor and Scull had lost their cabin ; there must have been at least a hundred shot holes in the mizzentop ; spars , yards , the foretop royal , half the bowsprit , were gone . Martinique was about a day 's sail . They must try to make it . His own head still rang with the sound of the guns . He tried to segregate the different phases of the action just past ; it was the speed of the " Athena " which had weighed in his favor , the speed gained by having the weather gage , which had allowed him to seize the offensive and force battle when he chose . The gun crews had worked well . From a broadside every minute and a half , they had reduced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sure . He watched the cruising boat . There were few cries now from the " Athena . " No more men 's heads could be seen in the darkening seas . And a sudden silence prevailed aboard , as it was thus borne in upon them that of a gallant ship and a crew of three hundred and fifty , this handful of men remained , dragged from the sea . They surveyed their own ship .  | More than fifteen minutes had passed . Jerrell stuck his head into the hatchway ; he smelled coffee . He asked a question which was answered in the affirmative . He went aft , fast as he could . Barney nodded in approval as he relayed his message . " Hands to supper , Mr. Scull , " he said . " Aye aye , sir , " Scull answered . " Mr. Jerrell , see to those Englishmen . Send them to the surgeon , then fore to supper . But I want to question one of them . I 'll leave it to your judgment , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " And Mr. Jerrell , after that I want you to see the surgeon and get that arm rebandaged . " " Aye aye , sir , " said Jerrell , and flew down the gangway ; the boat was pulling up alongside again , while Macgregor 's voice suddenly pierced across the decks . " Goddammit , what are you doing with those hoses ? Leave them rigged there ; do you think you 're going to leave the decks this way ? " Barney noticed Absolom at his elbow . He was carrying a cup of coffee . He knew Barney would n't leave the deck now . Two hours later Barney asked Scull and Macgregor to have supper with him . Scull , bending his head to enter the aftercabin , after washing up hastily , could hardly believe the last six hours had been . There was cold chicken and pork , and a big bowl of fruit on the table , and Absolom moved about as imperturbable as ever . Scull grinned at him . " Looks good , Absolom , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolom said , serving him coffee from the captain 's heavy silver pot . The three men sat for just a moment in silence . Then Macgregor said , " I know that the purpose of naval action in wartime is to sink enemy ships , sir , but it always gives me a shock to see her go  --  that last bit of mast . " Scull said , " But even if we had n't hit the powder magazines , she would n't have lasted much longer , sir . " " Yes , " said Macgregor , " but did you notice , sir , that the firing improved ? " He broke off ; he and Scull were doing all the talking . Barney smiled . " Go right ahead , Mr. Macgregor . " He listened to them as they recapitulated the battle past ; putting in a word here or there . In a few minutes , Mr. Jerrell knocked . " Bring the prisoner in , Mr. Jerrell , " Barney ordered .  | Jerrell did so . " This man is John Butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney nodded . " You may join us , Mr. Derrell . " He transferred his gaze to John Butler , from his bare feet to the top of his still wet head . " I see you received dry clothes , Butler . " Butler said , low , " Aye aye , sir . " Barney turned to Jerrell again . " Has Butler had anything to eat ? " " Aye aye , sir , " said Derrell . Barney 's face was impassive . He wanted information . " Absolom , give Butler a tot of rum . " " Thank you , sir ! " Butler was enthusiastic . He took the glass and cradled it in his hand . " You may drink it , " Barney said with a smile . Butler tossed it off , looked around at the three other officers hastily , and leaned forward and set the glass down on the table . " Thank you , sir , " he repeated . " Where did the Sybil ' sail from , Butler ? " Barney asked . Butler blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from looking at any of the three officers , and hoped devoutly they were not exchanging knowing glances . He said , " You took Stasia ? When ? " " The day before yesterday , sir . " Then he shifted uneasily . " Considering your ordeal by fire and water , Butler , I 'm going to allow you another tot of rum , " Barney said . " First , I want you to tell me in your own words what happened at Stasia . " Butler hesitated . The temptation was too much , and he was too weary to refuse . Besides that , Barney was looking right at him . He said , " We took the island , easy , sir , except the Yanks were loose in Lower Town , and Jeez , what a mess , sir . The marines and them was tangled up in the taverns all day , throwing bottles . " " Drink your rum , " Barney said . " Thank you , sir ! " Once more he drank it in a gulp , and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to make sure he was really here , and alive . His eyes gleamed . " Admiral Rodney is at Stasia ? " " Aye aye , sir , but Admiral Hood sailed . I saw the Barfleur ' myself , sir . " " And the Americans on Stasia . Are there some still at liberty ? " " They say so , sir . They said three hundred or more . "  | The rum had worked , Barney thought , as he wiped his mouth with his napkin and absently watched Absolom pour him a cup of coffee . Then he gestured to the rum . " Help yourselves , sirs , " he said . " We have a night ahead of us . " But he did n't give them much time . He was on his feet himself . Suddenly his smile flashed out . " I must have been more engrossed than I thought , " he said . " I 'll be damned if we have n't left those British officers in the cable tier ! " He doubled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been useless to ask Butler Hood 's destination ; it was useless to ask the British officers . But Hood would have a whole fleet . The course had been set to windward of Stasia , giving the island a wide berth . During the night as much work as possible was done . The rising morning sun saw part of the crew holystoning decks already scrubbed but still stained ; the gleaming white of new canvas contrasted with the old suit of sails . New spars had been placed , and running gear rereeved . But below the pumps still worked constantly , and even so there was two feet of water in the wells . Macgregor and his crews worked on the gun carriages ; the burial service was read and ten more men wrapped in hammocks slid over the side into a bluing and vast sea . There were more than a third of the crew wounded ; some of them would not recover . The price of victory was high . The English sailors had given their parole and worked side by side with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many tasks ; they were all lucky to be alive , and unhurt . Jerrell wore his bandage with covert pride . Barney was badly worried , but gave no outward sign of it . It had been a bitter battle and the effects were lasting throughout this day . The winning had been exciting ; the battle itself sobering , and officers and crew responded first to one and then to the other . Macgregor , for instance , had lost his temper over a triviality , and had not Barney appeared immediately , an innocent man would have suffered . Macgregor cooled down , and remained cool . It seemed to Barney sometimes that Absolom was the most dependable of them all . He was worried because of the known fact of the presence of Hood and his fleet . The " Athena " could not run fast from anything . Nor was there sanctuary near , nearer than Basseterre , on Guadeloupe , and that course would certainly bring him into contact  | with Rodney 's cruisers out from Stasia . Whereas he could set his course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where he wanted to be . If any man would know what had happened and what was happening at Stasia it would be the Governor of the French island , the Marquis de Bouille . Stasia itself , across the water , unseen , lured him , but he postponed thinking about it until he knew all the facts . But Douglass would be safe ; even though she was in English hands , no one would harm her . But during the long day , only one sail was sighted . Barney supposed she was a merchantman because on their sighting , she had changed course and fled . He could not give chase ; she might be an American vessel making for what she thought was the security of Stasia . He was not one to waste time in regret . The blow he had expected had come . He had thought perhaps good could be wrested from it ; Stasia was quite a pie , and once the British had their fingers in it , they would be occupied for some time counting their profits . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and energies to holding onto it . The spy system on Stasia was so well established , and the methods used heretofore so devious , that Barney smiled when he thought of Rodney trying to stamp it out . And what would they do with all they had captured ? Short of sitting there on it , they would be compelled to send it home to England or to other British islands . Anything that floated was to Barney already half his . As long as he was able to cruise . In the first ten minutes of the first dogwatch , at eight minutes after four , Mt . Pelee was sighted . It was a hot day , with a fair wind , and a cloudless sky . Mt . Pelee beckoned . By morning they should be putting into Fort de France . Five minutes later a second call came from the lookouts ; the call Barney had feared . It rang out over the ship . " Sail-ho ! Two points off the starboard bow ! " Scull snapped out an order to Jerrell , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deck . " Four sail ; five ! " There was a pause . " Seven ! " Then , " Three sail on the starboard quarter ! " Scull whirled to see Barney standing alongside of him . " There 's hardly need to relay the message to me , Mr. Scull , " Barney said laconically.  | He went fore , and began to climb to the foretopgallant masthead . Jerrell obligingly swung over and sat on a yardarm . Barney swung the glass slowly . He said nothing . Jerrell blurted , " I can see ten , sir ! " Barney answered this . " Nineteen . " There was no doubt about it ; they had found Hood and his fleet . Hood was blockading Fort de France . Barney glued the glass to his eye . Why Fort de France ? Why , indeed ? De Bouille had said there were four frigates there , when he had sailed five days ago . Surely Hood would n't waste nineteen ships , blockading for four . Barney frowned . He swung the glass . Jerrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , sir ! " The silence lengthened . Jerrell squirmed . Five minutes passed . Then Barney called down to deck . " Mr. Scull ! Get the courses in ! " Jerrell leaned over to look way down to deck . The boatswain 's voice floated up . " All shorten sail ! " Quite some time passed before Barney was sure of his first surmise ; what intelligences Hood had had were correct , then . Barney said , " Mr. Jerrell , I 'm going to leave you up here for thirty minutes with my glass . " He handed it over as Jerrell swung back to the masthead . " Report to me in thirty minutes , " he said . He started down to deck . His mind raced ahead . Now he would be free to cruise ! As soon as he could get the " Athena " ready for the sea again ? His mind raced with plans . He gained the deck and went aft . Scull turned from the rail , glass in hand . Barney grinned . " Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Mr. Scull ? " Scull nodded . " Aye aye , sir ! " " It 'll be quite a sight , when we fall in with them . " Scull said , " I ca n't believe it , sir ! " Macgregor was talking to himself , as he looked . " The whole French fleet , " he was repeating . " The whole goddamned fleet ! " 32 " THIS CAME THIS MORNING , " THE MARQUIS SAID , FLINGING THE letter down on the polished table . " Read it , sir ! "  | Barney picked it up and read : " H. M. S. Sandwich . St. Eustatious March 4 " I have received the honor of your Excellency 's letters , and am sorry to find that a man of such high rank should descend so far as to use intelligences which he confesses came to him in an indirect way . " British admirals are responsible to none but their sovereign and their ' country , and were never known to insult an open and declared enemy . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traitors , and rebels to their King deserve no consideration and none shall they ever meet with at my hands . " I must again repeat to your Excellency that I can no longer permit flags of truce to pass between the King my master 's islands and those of the French . This communication I am determined to prevent , and I have given orders to all my cruisers to seize and detain all flags of truce but such as General Vaughn and myself may be honoured with from you , without exception . " It was signed G. B. Rodney . Barney looked up . " This spoils your intelligence system . " He could n't help smiling . The marquis was in no smiling mood . " That sanctimonious devil , " he said , " has refused to exchange prisoners , and the French merchants on Stasia ! According to him , they come under these , " he tapped the letter , " perfidious people ' ! I have replied . I have replied thus , " said the marquis calming down a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . " I am satisfied that a British Admiral ought to be responsible to his King and Country . To both , I owe reprisals ; they shall be forthcoming . You have set the example and I shall pursue it . " He looked up at Barney over the letter to punctuate this . He went on . " I repeat once more that you may act as you please towards our flags of truce . To quiet your apprehensions on that score , I shall send no more . In the future the interpretations of our sentiments shall be our cannon . " " Very much to the point , m'lord , " Barney said , crossing long legs . From outside in the gardens came the sound of hammering as the construction of a dance floor under the palms went on . Six hundred  | people had been invited to a reception for the Comte de Grasse and his officers tonight . The marquis laid the letter down . " You will miss the festivities , sir , " he said . " I am sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " There can be no possible doubt but that Francois was caught on Stasia , and now lurks somewhere in the hills with the Americans . Mr. Ross , in his last communication , " the marquis grimaced , " supposed there to be from three to four hundred of them , but they surrender daily  --  starved , feverish . Rodney has arrested Curyon and Gouvernier , and sent them as prisoners of state to England , for treasonable trading with the enemy . All goods , including those of French merchants , have been confiscated ; the food is even doled out to each household ! When they are deported , they may take only household goods and household slaves with them ! Rodney is also after the Englishmen who became Dutch burghers , to enjoy the trading air of Stasia . " The marquis smiled . " All canoes have to be drawn up on the beaches before dark . Fort Oranje now boasts forty ten-pounders . Batteries are being constructed  --  we 're not quite sure where . " " I do n't wonder Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The marquis said , " We must keep communications open . The situation now is that we can watch Hood , and his fleet , since they retreated to St. Lucia . We must devise means to watch Stasia . I have requested Captain Connor to attend us . He waits . " The marquis crossed the floor and opened a door ; Barney waited for the sight of the man who was to accompany him on his next mission . Connor was Irish , with freckles and hazel eyes . A scar marked one cheek ; adventurer and professional soldier , he commanded the marquis ' garrison of some five hundred men . He wore a resplendent uniform , dark blue with red facings , with a line of white down neat trouser leg . " Captain Connor , " Barney said , bowing . " As soon as you two have said hello , we will get down to business , " the marquis said , and went over to the wall and unrolled a magnificent map of the islands which covered almost one whole wall . Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the three of them stood in front of it . The marquis , with a long wand in hand , looked at both of them and smiled with satisfaction . " You are two aces I have against the British , sirs , " he said , and his smile was delighted . " Now . Attendez ! Here are we . " The marquis loved his maps , and he loved strategy with Machiavellian fervor . He was enjoying himself this morning ; it was with some regret he realized his correspondence with Rodney was at an end . However , the bullets would come next , as he had promised . " Here are we , and de Grasse , and twenty some ships of the line , besides my four frigates . Here is Hood . Close . " He pointed to St. Lucia . " Hood is kept under surveillance at all times . "  | That surveillance was good , Barney knew . Good and accurate . It was going to allow him to proceed with assurance that he was not bearding Hood and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . " Here is Stasia , Saba , and St. Martin  --  a stone 's throw from St. Kitts and Nevis . In British hands . We watch from Guadeloupe . " " One moment , " Connor said . " Once we take Stasia back , we are free to include St. Kitts and Nevis in the same bundle , my lord . They go together . " " Later , " said the marquis . Then he said , " You understand , I have no say ? " he gestured ? " as to the doings of the fleet and le Comte de Grasse . I tell you confidentially we must do all this out here in the islands ourselves . The fleet serves as a balance wheel only . " " A big one , " said Barney , and Connor nodded . " May I smoke , m'lord ? " he asked , and knowing the answer would be in the affirmative , got out his pipe . He filled it abstractedly . He said , " The damage done by the Yanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now the regiments which General Vaughn is leaving on Stasia are the thirteenth and the fifteenth . " The marquis walked over to his desk , and got out a small notebook . He opened it . " Six hundred and twenty men , Colonel Cockburne commanding . Harris , surgeon , Captains Bathe , Rigerson , Lieutenants " ? he read down the list ? " Mackenzie , engineering . He 's good . " The marquis squinted at both younger men . " Let 's leave that for a moment , and look once more at the map . " Connor puffed on his pipe . Barney took his eyes from Stasia and followed the marquis ' pointer . " Curacao has fallen , yesterday , but we have reason to believe it is about to be succored . " He grinned . " We can count on the Dutch to retake it shortly . We can not retake Stasia till Rodney and the fleet leave it . But we can strike a blow by removing the Americans ; and we must try to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Barney pointed to the map of Stasia . " I propose to use Tumble-  | down Dick for the evacuation ; the bay is deep , the beach shelving and sandy . At Jenkin 's Bay , I can anchor within a stone 's throw of what beach there is , but there is a precipitous cliff wall reaching right down into the water . On all sides . More necks would be broken than those I 'd save . " Connor said , " Tumbledown Dick is best , I think , sir . For the first landing . " He smiled contentedly . " The second time , Jenkin 's Bay . " Barney eyed him thoughtfully . " Yes , Captain Connor . " The marquis looked at both of them . " A coup de main  --  by way of Jenkin 's Bay ? But , sirs , that cliff wall is three hundred feet down , and straight down ! " " In ancient castles they used scaling ladders . On shipboard , we use rope . " Barney said , next , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wore uniforms almost exactly like the British  --  red coats with yellow reveres . Did the similarity ever strike you ? Well , " he ended , " all that later . First get the men off . We will approach the island from the north , m'lord . We 'll slip out tonight . " Joshua woke suddenly , sitting upright . The late moon , hovering halfway down the incline of the star-sprinkled skies , threw its light palely in the cave and on the sleeping girl at his side . In its white light her face had an ethereal quality . She slept with one bared round arm under her head ; her long braids tumbled over one shoulder . Joshua reached down and covered her legs carefully with her skirt , tucking the material around her bare feet , and pulling his shirt over the bare arm . He felt her hand . It was cool . In sleep now , her face looked thin , too . The long lashes covered the darkish blue signs of fatigue . In sudden anxiety he felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow , he looked at her and slowly the long lashes lifted and her eyes opened . She said , " Joshua ? " She sighed a little , and moved slightly toward him ; he put his arms around her and drew her close . For a moment neither spoke . Then Lucie said , " What wakened you , Joshua ? " " I do n't know , " he said . But he did know . " You looked so sweet . " " I was dreaming . " She smiled at him . " What ? " he asked , kissing the edge of her cheek . " I was dreaming we were having supper again tonight . " " I could have eaten it twice , " he said . " I know . But I was listening again to you and Francois talk , and  | it was nice to hear you . It is nice to have such warm regard for another , is it not ? " She traced her finger along the side of his face . " As it grows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joshua . He was silent . Lucie glanced at him . " Food did not waken you , then ? " She asked the question as if she knew the answer . She did . " No , " he said . " You want to tell me ? " " I was thinking . " She said soberly , " Please tell me . " He held her a little away . Then he said , " You can not stay here longer . I am going to give myself up , and take you with me . " " Ah , no ! " She twisted away and sat up . She repeated , " No , please ! " He stretched out full length and frowned up at her . " Do n't cozen me , wench . " Then he took her hand , and turned it over in his . " Thin little hand , " he said . " I ca n't stand it any longer , Lucie . It 's impossible . " His voice was strong . " Tomorrow I take you into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British . " " Please , Joshua ! " she said . " There are a few times when I arrive at decisions and do not alter them . " He sat up himself and kissed her " I love you , sweetheart . " He pulled at one braid and stretched out again . " But I ca n't stand it any longer , Lucie ! " " I do not argue , " she said , whereupon Joshua laughed . " I do not argue because I know it is useless , " she added , and curled up beside him with her head on his shoulder . Joshua said , " I may be able to bribe our way out . At first I hated to give up . " His arms tightened around her . " I do n't want to do it , darling ! But I must . If something happened to you , " he spoke slowly , " I should never forgive myself . Never . " The moonlight shimmered . " But , " she began , and then stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes fastened on his bearded face ; he could see the rise and fall of her breast as she waited for the answer . " Probably nothing , " said Joshua comfortingly . She did n't believe him . She said clearly , " I love you so much . " He caught her close . " Listen , darling . Even if we are separated , it wo n't be for so long ! We 'll be together again . It wo n't last long ! It
