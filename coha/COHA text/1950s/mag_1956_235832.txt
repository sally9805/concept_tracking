THE NINTH WAVE ( 332 pp. ) - Eugene Burdick-Houghfon Mifflin ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> In this first-novel winner of the Houghton Mifflin award , Author Burdick gives a reverse twist to the cozy U.S. sociological convention that coarse , conservative fathers produce sensitive , nonconformist sons . It is a study of Mike Freesmith , whose father was a radical so militant he once smashed the family Christmas tree into bourgeois smithereens . To contrast his old man , Mike determines to become a " big wheeler and dealer . " He starts rolling as a clean-limbed , sexually limber nihilist on a surfboard off the coast of South ern California . He is supposed to be getting an education ; instead he is educating the English teacher in the arts of love . He goes on in this way to become a Big Man on Campus at Stanford , then a political lawyer with a puppeteer 's talent for running the show from behind the scenes . Along the way , he exploits and blows cigar smoke into the faces of a whole range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her vineyards ) , and a blackmail-prone professor , up to the top brass of the California Democratic Party . He is cool , ruthless , sadistic ; even his one friend , Hank Moore , sees him as a lost , fragmented being-an " upward mobile . " <P> By the time he is set to mastermind the election for governor of a drunken windbag named John Cromwell , Freesmith has developed into a full clinical picture of an icy-hearted opportunist in action . He figures that fear plus hate equals power . By manipulating the fear of poverty of California 's " senior citizens " and exploiting general hatred of Communism , he hopes to become the real governor of California . In a not quite credible solution , his pal Hank removes the hard hand of Mike Freesmith from the public weal . <P> Novelist Burdick , who teaches political theory at the University of California , says that he originally intended his novel as " a study on the ' irrational ' trends in politics , " but it grew into a portrait of one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural and narrative faults . Still , it stands by itself as a disquieting , often fascinating portrait of a recognizable type of politician , a type who in real life , perhaps unfortunately , usually lacks a friend willing to dispose of him .
