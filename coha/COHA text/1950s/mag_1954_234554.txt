On narrow Saunders Street , in the shoddy suburb called Caraleigh at the southern fringe of Raleigh , N.C. , stands the Windmill . Its dragon-green neon arms whirl day and night , its sexy carhops skip out in black slacks to take orders on the big , asphalt parking space , its gigantic jukebox , hitched up to outdoor amplifiers , drenches the area with blare : Pin Ball Boogie , maybe , or Jo Stafford 's plangent yearning for someone to Make Love to Me - and always plenty of hillbilly . <P> Presiding over the Windmill 's pleasures is 38-year-old ex-Marine Sam Bell , a hard and practical man . <P> God in the Bush Arbor . Across the street from the Windmill is a vacant lot . <P> There , early this month , came the local members of the Church of God , bent on a three-week revival for the healing of bodies and the saving of souls . They put up an open-sided shelter roofed over with sweetgum boughs , and covered the clay ground with sawdust . They filled the place with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed two big amplifiers . <P> Presiding over these preparations was handsome , hefty ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 215 Ibs . ) Douglas H. Poole , 23 , a North Carolina farm boy who was wounded in Korea , saw visions there , came home to be a full-time minister of the Church of God . ( " There are three Churches of God , " he says . <P> " This is the original . " ) The revival got under way . Striding excitedly around his congregation , and sweating with fervor , Evangelist Poole shouted and whispered into his microphone . " I used to be a drunkard , " he would yell . " I used to curse and tell lies and all those things . But I 've been saved ! ... If you come , you can find God around this old bush arbor ... If you go home lost tonight , it 's not my fault . " His flock would begin to groan and shout , to shake and roll in the sawdust . Then a string quartet would take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts and gyrations . <P> Pray for Sam Bell . Across the street in the Windmill , Sam Bell and his customers listened for several nights with mounting distaste . " It got louder and louder , " says Sam . " I could n't even hear the girls when they called the orders . " Finally , one night last week , one of the Windmill 's customers made a suggestion , and Sam Bell suited action to the word . <P> Into the big jukebox went another nickel , up went the amplifiers to full power , and out into the night blasted Bye Bye Blues in a mighty shockwave of sound . <P> " Glory be to God ! " cried Preacher Poole into his microphone . " Pray for Sam Bell . Save Sam Bell . The Devil can only go so far . There 'll be no jukeboxes in heaven . " The faithful groaned and flung themselves to their knees ; their own amplifiers rushed to meet Satan over Saunders Street with a full-throated Leaning on the Everlasting Arms . <P> Since the fallen walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motorists stopped . People in town heard about it and jumped in their cars to go out and see what was going on . Finally , the portly figure of Wake County Deputy Sheriff Carl Benton appeared . When he managed to make himself heard , the decibel count fell to normal .
