In Italy they have an old custom which allows a taxpayer to declare his own income for purposes of local taxation , subject to correction by a commission of his fellow citizens . The tendency is to lie and let lie . In the town of Guastalla ( pop . 6,000 ) , which sprawls peacefully along the banks of the Po River , the president of the local tax commission is a Communist . Professor Remo Salati , who wears a double-breasted suit like Communist Leader Togliatti and imitates Togliatti 's manner of talking , also has access to federal tax returns in which taxpayers , in the face of stringent new tax laws , assess their incomes more realistically . <P> Noting a glaring discrepancy between what the townspeople told the local government and the federal government , Communist Salati sent a card around to taxable townsfolk notifying them that their local taxes had been revised sharply upward . In most cases , taxes would be three times as high . <P> Next day hundreds crowded city hall , sure that there must be some mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of protest , but the Socialist-Communist majority on the town council upheld Salati 's assessments . Then a strange thing occurred in the quiet town of Guastalla . Businessmen and shopkeepers called for a six-hour strike against Salati . Every bar and shop in town closed . Local factories sent their workers home . Buses ceased running . Even the Communist-run cooperative store shut its door ( for this , Manager Affro Tavernelli was later relieved of his party card ) . Guastalla became a ghost town . <P> When Salati heard that the bar run by the Communist welfare organization had closed , he ordered it reopened . Not a customer appeared until 5 , when Salati himself showed up for a coffee . " I am sorry , comrade , " said the barman , " but there 's no pressure in the coffee machine . " Salati settled for a warm orange squash . Later the local newspaper , which had also closed down for the six hours , crowed : " The first strike of its kind in Italy . A complete success . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing his ground-but so were Guastalla 's taxpayers .
