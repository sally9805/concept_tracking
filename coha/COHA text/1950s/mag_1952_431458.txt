ONE sunny day last May , a bareheaded man in tweeds fished a letter from his pocket and posted it . The address was scrawled in pencil : " Santa Claus . North Pole . " What made this letter very special was this : after being mailed it spiraled down four miles and landed smack at its destination ? the North Pole . Capt . Charles Blair , streaking across the rooftop of the world in one of the great flights of history , dispatched a thought wave to a small son in faraway New York : " Operation Santa . Mission Accomplished . " BIair 's second objective ? tagged Operation Suicide by fellow airmen ? was still anybody 's guess . High over that shimmering wilderness of ice he was risking his neck to explore a matter of international importance : are the long-hoped-for transpolar flights finally in sight ? Earth Spins Like Football So far the difficulties of arctic flying have outweighed the advantage of shorter distances . Only very-long-range military planes with special navigating aids , fuel for 10.000 miles , crews of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the North Pole the earth spins underneath a plane like a gigantic football . No destination stays put , no magnetic compass registers correctly , no radio can reach the earphones . The floating icecap is in ceaseless turmoil , breaking up , refreezing , cracking again . There is no place to land in safety , and an error of a few degrees can spell the difference between Alaska and Siberia . What , them got into quiet , serious , 40-year-old Charlie Blair to make him march off to the bank one day draw out his savings and transform himself into a one-man polar expedition ? Blair 's record marked him the precise opposite of stunt man . He was a master airline captain with more than 3,000,000 miles and 450 Atlantic crossings in the log . Headshaking began when Blair bought an Army-surplus Mustang F-51 , vintage 1943 . It was a museum puce as fighters go , but for the buyer its charm lay in its record . The tiny ship had twice won the Bendix Air Races . It was fast and it was strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Tank Is Born The revamping of this old propeller-driven jalopy into an aerial hot rod capable of distance flying monopolized months of Blair 's spare time . But by January , 1951 , the Mustang was ready to go places . She had a new 1,700-horsepower Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and a staggering new fuel capacity . She had a new name , too , Excalibur III , hut around the hangars she was called " the Flying Gas Tank . " Blair 's idea of a warm-up flight provoked more headshaking . He proposed to ride the winter winds from New York to London , 3,479 miles nonstop ? astride a jet stream . These jet streams are westerly winds of super-hurricane force that boil around the upper stratosphere , reaching a peak of 250  | miles an hour or more in winter . Given a wild winter 's day , Blair thought , why not combine a shakedown cruise with an exploratory feeler into the speedways of to-morrow ? January 30 provided the right setup and Blair had three days ' leave . With the wind barreling down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the route , he lifted Excalibur from Idlewild International Airport and disappeared into an overcast of snow and ice . Seven hours and 48 minutes later he set her down alongside London 's sooty chimney stacks . Man and machine between them had shattered every transatlantic speed mark in the book ? their record still stands , jets notwithstanding . Blair traveled faster than any distance flier in history , with an average speed of seven and a half miles per minute . Landing in London with ample fuel reserve convinced the pilot that he had licked Excalibur 's distance handicap . There still remained that other obstacle ? navigation over the polar icecap . Today when airmen get together , Blair 's  | " prepackaged " navigation is still Topic A. It made aviation history and blueprinted a method by which passenger liners may soon be following his trail across the Pole . Using existing principles , he figured out a way of doing the complicated work beforehand and boiled down flight procedures to a simple routine . Ready to " Read " the Sun First he set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , he plotted on a chart his roadway through the sky , a beeline from Bardufoss , Norway , to Fairbanks , Alaska . He chopped it up into hours and established from navigational tables the angle that the sun would make to each of these time intersections at a specific minute . With a fixed take-off time , he could make the sun give him a route marker for almost every mile of the trip . Getting a sun bearing , or angle , in flight is a simple operation , like looking down the peep sight of a rifle . Blair bought a sun compass , or angle measurer , for $12 and mounted it in the cockpit . He also bought a bubble sextant to help him to determine whether or not the wind was drifting him off course . With these two instruments and a preplotted course , all he would have to do en route would be to read off sun angles and compare them with the corresponding readings on the chart . If they agreed , he was on course . If they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose around until they did . Arctic Gear : a Four-Leaf Clover Blair selected May for his flight , a time when arctic weather is normally at its best . On May 29 the sun and moon would be almost at right angles at the Pole , a phenomenon which offered opportunity for a navigational double check . He chose Bardufoss , just inside the Arctic Circle , for his departure point . Almost invisible beside a small fjord , it is locked in by spectacular ravines and mountains . Blair landed there at noon on May 29 , ceiling unlimited . His schedule called for a take-off at 1500 Greenwich Mean Time . By 1430 GMT he had checked the plane with Lindbergh-like precision , had set his three watches and reshot the sun . In those remaining minutes , misgivings seized the airport personnel . The picture just refused to add up to a polar exploration ? the bareheaded man in tweeds , that tiny plane , daring to challenge the harshest wilderness on earth ! Where were the deerskin parkas , the bearskin face rolls , the hareskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the sledges , skis , pickaxes ? All Blair had checked aboard was a four-leaf clover , a letter to Santa Claus and the first polar air mail ? 3,000 postcards to be auctioned off for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund . Those Americans ! The airport clock clicked to 1458 GMT . Blair waved and closed the cockpit cover . 1459 GMT . . . Zero ! The tires began to roll . It was the heaviest take-off in the history of that arctic hideaway . The only exit lay downwind over the bottom of a gorge , the sides of which towered 5,000 feet . Spectators held their breaths . Faster and faster turned the wheels , straining to outrun that tail wind . One hundred , 120 , 130 miles per hour . The tail , glutted with gas , dragged like a meal sack . Out of the corner of one eye , Blair sensed the runway scorching by . . . a third . . . a half . . . The next few seconds would decide . Then , hallelujah , up came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ... and Excalibur was airborne in a photo finish with the ending runway . A Human Calculating Machine Blair adjusted his oxygen mask and set up the sun compass . From now on , this was his routine : every 10 minutes take bearing , check with packaged plan , adjust course as necessary to keep astride meridian 20 . Every hour double check with sextant . For the rest , watch panel , watch fuel , nurse engine , check oil , check distance run , just keep on being a human calculating machine . Below , the sea was like plate glass . Beneath its unlined face rotted a thousand unsung polar expeditions . How guileless can you look , Blair wondered , with such an infamous record ? As if to answer him , the sea whipped up a mist ; in a moment it thickened and climbed up almost to the fuselage . Date With a Radio Signal Blair swore a little . At Spitsbergen , the most northerly habitation in the world , he had a date with a radio signal ? atmospherics permitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spitsbergen 's main tower . Luck was with him . The signal , streaming in high and clear , indicated the island passing a little to the west , just where it should have been . On course ! On time !  | Blair 's spirits soared . He switched off the radio . Next call Alaska ! Now he hoisted Excalibur to 22,000 feet , his thriftiest cruising altitude . For nearly an hour he flew on without any sense of progress . Time and distance seemed to count for nothing . He felt like an insect trapped between cloud and firmament . The midnight sun , blazing into the cockpit , made him swelter despite his summer underwear ; he might be over Florida , with orange groves beneath the overcast . Polar Icecap Below As if to reassure him , the clouds thinned out abruptly . Soon a great , ragged hole appeared , and Blair caught his breath . Below him stretched a sight that men have dreamed about for centuries , but few have seen ? the soulless , silver-plated panorama of the polar icecap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helmeted the world , the legendary realm without a sunset or a dawn . From four miles up the ice-ocean looked solid as a continent , crisscrossed by " leads " of young ice . Across these treacherous leads , with sleds and huskies , over trackless gray blue hummocks of old ice , had gone the trail blazers , hoping with every mile to find new land , but coming upon nothing but more ice floes . Blair checked the panel , took his hourly sun sight . The chart indicated that he was passing near the area where , 25 years before , the first attempt to reach the Pole by air had ended abruptly . just about here , the Amundsen-Ellsworth expedition had been forced down a scant 140 miles from the goal . Blair recalled Ellsworth 's description of that landing on a frozen sea , " choked with a chaotic mass of floating ice ? it was like trying to land in the Grand Canyon . " It sent a shiver up his spine . Excalibur 's landing speed was 145 miles per hour ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pole approximately five hours after his departure . Fifteen minutes before the appointed time , he began to worry . The moon should now be popping up above the starboard sky line . It would be one degree above the earth at the North Pole . He strained his eyes through the intensifying haze . No moon . Was it because the haze was hiding it or ? was there a joker lurking in that package ? Perhaps he had just been chasing the sun around in circles all this while . He resisted an almost overpowering urge to forget the chart and climb to profligate heights to find out if that moon was really there or not . But then he realized that the moon must be hidden by the mist . Moon or no moon , Blair was now rapidly approaching latitude 90 degrees north ? the Pole . This is the theoretical pinprick on the ice where compass points dissolve and every wind that blows is from the south . Blair fumbled in his pocket for his son ' letter .  | music of humanity . PBA PBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for home , this way to people , houses , trees , this way back to a cockeyed , wonderful old world .. . Sun Is the Loser Blair passed over Point Barrow one minute ahead of flight plan . Less than two hours later postal authorities at Fairbanks , Alaska , began to stamp hour-of-arrival on the first polar air mail . Those 3,000 postcards had flown across the rooftop of the world so fast that they had beaten the sun from Norway to Alaska by more than half an hour . Actual flying time was H ) hours 27 minutes . Blair , 10 pounds lighter following those 3,300 miles sweating inside an oxygen mask , was aching and weary , but exultant . His one-man charge against the icecap had transformed the mirage of shorter , swifter , cheaper air routes over the North Pole into reality . A few days later , spruce in his company uniform , Capt . Charles Blair stood at Idlewild , watching his passengers embark on the great Stratocruiser he was about to fly to London . " I see some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one passenger was saving . " Crazy , I guess ! " Blair grinned . " Could be , " he said . " Seems like some guys just have to get that North Pole out of their systems ! " END He raised his sextant , preset it for 90 degrees north and squinted at the sun . And there it was , dead center in the bubble . He had reached-the North Pole ! Mail Drop for Santa Claus Out of the sliding window zipped the letter to Santa Claus , and a wave of emotion swept over Blair . That penciled scrawl was going to land close to the spot where , locked in ice , reposes one of history 's milestones , a monument to human courage . Almost half a century ago six swaddled figures had stood down there , planting the Stars and Stripes , while one of them , through cracked and bleeding lips , said , " I ... formally take possession ... in the name of the President of the United States . " It had taken Robert E. Peary 23 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icecap . Now came the test of tests for Blair . At the precise moment when he crossed the Pole everything in the world , all oceans , countries , all humanity , lay south . It was like sitting up above a Maypole , faced with one 's pick of countless streamers . Just one led to Point Barrow , Alaska . Its neighbors streamed off to Siberia , to Greenland , to wastes of sea and land . It was unlikely that Point Barrow 's radio signals could reach him for another four hours . Until they did , the sun remained the only guidepost that could show him the way home . Sun Creeps Behind In the past five hours , as the earth had turned , the sun had crept from behind Blair 's left shoulder and now was slowly moving up toward the bow of his plane . It had begun to glaze the blue gray mist , making it difficult to see ahead . He rose to 25,000 feet , where the glare was less , and bored on , cleaving the ghostly silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point immediately above Excalibur 's nose . Blair was now flying in a globe of shining haze which shut off visibility in all directions . With every hour the glare increased and the cockpit seemed to shrink . He felt as if he were the loneliest human being in the world . Then he flicked a switch , setting the radio direction finder for Point Barrow . The needle quivered into life , swung , steadied , came to rest . Dot-dash-dash-dot ? dash-dotclot-dot ? dot-dash ? the faint , intoxicating  |
