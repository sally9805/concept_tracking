txt  | But these provisions advising citizens of their duty to their government are eloquent . They imply that a club is needed to get the support the government demands , and that trouble may be anticipated for those who oppose the government in any way . The consent of the government , apparently , is absent . Mandates of that character are not found in the Constitution of the United States . Any attempt to include them would have brought outright rejection . Imagine what Henry and Jefferson would have said had the proposed constitution carried threats of that character ! Chapter XI , Articles 134 to 142 , treats the fundamental subject of elections . Article 135 is supposed to reflect a modified spirit with respect to who shall participate in government . It goes to the extreme of giving the ballot to all those above 17 years of age . The political leaders apparently were satisfied that all property owners had been liquidated and that only workers remained to exercise the ballot privileges . But one must bear in mind that the voters only vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Presidium and the Commissars . The present ballot privileges of the Russian therefore at their best are much narrower than those provided for in the United States Constitution . In fact , it is mere gesture , because the policy fixing officials of the government are not directly affected by the ballot . Amending this constitution is a very simple matter . Article 146 , Chapter XIII , provides that a two-thirds majority of the legislators may amend it . It departs from the traditional democratic idea that constitutions must be referred to the people and that they should be difficult to amend , because of the generally recognized and well-established principles found in them . However , as the Russian Constitution contains much experimental matter , it will have to be changed frequently , too often  | to make it practical to submit the issues to the people . The issues also will be too complex , too full of controversy and demand too much haste to justify submission to them , although in the United States voters are called upon to solve the problems which presidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , many amendments will be made to this constitution by subterfuge and deliberate unauthorized practice . Amendments by that method are not unusual . The United States Constitution has suffered much from that practice . For instance , the so-called liberal or social laws have transferred so much authority to the executive branch that the President is forced to usurp judicial and legislative functions as well as become the war-declaring power . These same laws have so enlarged governmental benefits that the ballot , which is overwhelmingly made up of the destitute , the desperate , the ignorant , the misinformed , the fearful and the unscrupulous , directs the policies of state . A poor foundation for economic security , and certainly not what the Forefathers had in mind . The whole program is a means of amending , indeed destroying , the Constitution . It widens the field of governmental immunity ( sovereign power ) far beyond what is authorized under the Constitution . It upsets the relationship of the Federal Government to the States and the citizens . Washington 's admonition in his farewell address with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Civil War amendments , the income tax amendment , and the amendment changing the method of electing Senators , are , of course , entirely out of harmony with the original Constitution , and have already revealed that they are detrimental to economic security . Amendments can be disastrous if they nullify or depart from the idea in the original charter . Because of the easy manner in which the Russian constitu-  | tion may be amended the Russians , in fact , do not have a constitution . All they have is a treatise on the obligations of citizens to their leaders , an indictment of a prior economic structure , promises of great things to come , and the fundamentals of government reduced to mere statutory law . Laws which must be constantly changed because they are experimental and detailed ( a factor in statutory law ) have no place in a constitution , and fundamentals lose their significance if they can be readily abrogated , especially in time of economic upheaval . This constitution has already failed in an alleged democratic objective ? short term of office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles through which Mussolini and Hitler acquired such a title , which both lost for other reasons than elections . But in what countries are the leaders not enjoying or holding long terms of office ? Government of that character precludes changes of administration , because the leaders are tied too closely to business and every other phase of life . It is the opposite of what the Forefathers tried to make for the United States and believed would most adequately protect freedom ? a chance to make a decent living by way of merit and ability in the field- of production , instead of using , as required by the " liberal " forms of government , every ounce of initiative and ability to keep governmental favor . It seems as though Karl Marx has won . Nations have embraced , or are rapidly embracing , his philosophies of government under the titles of Fascism , Democracy , Social Democracy , Dictatorship of the Proletariat , Totalitarianism and Liberalism . They come riding on the god of war , to be followed by large standing armies and the four horsemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , of course , but at least until the political world learns to respect again the individualism of man .  | KEY PROPOSITIONS Free enterprise is not without hardships and corruption . But if civilization can not maintain high standards under free enterprise , it certainly can not do so under government control , a procedure which only adds more graft and corruption to the already heavy load . Under such circumstances security is bound to vanish . There is no yardstick by which to determine when a free enterprise structure has been converted into social democracy , a welfare ( police ) state or communism . However , when government is responsible to its subjects for their food and shelter to the extent recommended by the " liberals " , it will be the government , in times of distress , that will have to seize their farms and their homes , reduce their salaries , cut off their opportunities , compel them to move and deny them the right to exercise their own initiative and judgment . The hate and malice directed toward government under such circumstances creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from the nose of the inspector . The new forms of government are dependent . They can not survive unless other countries conform to their standards and practices .  | Footnote  | " Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely . " " LIBERALS " AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY CHAPTER II Free Enterprise as the Solution It is necessary to review some familiar back-ground in order to properly evaluate the theories of the " Liberal " with respect to private industry , business , commerce , property . At the time of the Constitutional Convention economic distress engulfed the country . Desperation , starvation , and anarchy prevailed . Civil war broke out in Massachusetts under a program to repudiate all debts and seize property for distribution to the poor . ' Other States on the same premises were so near to civil war that another jolt would plunge them into it . Recommendations for adjustment were mostly that the government seize everything in order to pay the private debts and satisfy the hungry . The property of the Tories , of course , was in particular danger because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their property while those who had fought in the war were starving . ' However , as things stood , anyone who had property was afraid of losing it because those without property , the great majority , were ready to take it by legislation , taxation , confiscation , riots , mob action , or civil war .  | The destitute desired to place everything under government control . Consequently , only business men , lawyers , judges and legislators who advocated repudiation of debts and seizure of property had popular favor . Many of the politicians , therefore , were keyed in that direction . ' There was little sentiment among the destitute for representative government from the standpoint of protection for private industry ? free enterprise . In those days , too , the destitute ( and who could blame them ) were clamoring for governmental distribution of wealth in the name of democracy , and , of course , also without realizing that such procedure would result in an economic structure in which subjects look ( in vain ) to government for jobs , food , homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper class there was not much sentiment for representative government , except from the standpoint of protection of title to property . The clamor and agitation for debt repudiation and seizure of property for government relief programs frightened the owners of property . Naturally , those with property were advocating the minimum of government control . With the tremendous pressure on one side for debt repudiation and seizure of private property for relief of the destitute , and on the other the demand for protection of private property , it was a miracle that representative government , the right to vote and own property , as contemplated by the Constitution , came as the result of the 1787 Convention . It also was a miracle that complete government control of the means of Footnote  | production did not develop , as it developed in Russia from 1917 to about 1921 . The Objective of the Forefathers The Forefathers , therefore , were in a position to realize that unless they took drastic action against the current proposals , economic security would permanently perish . They , particularly , were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , independent of government favoritism , dole and charity , vanished completely when a substantial number of voting citizens became dependent on government , looked to it , for their food , shelter , jobs , wages and hours of work . They , therefore , turned to the theory of the right of the private citizen ( under the checks of competition and ballot restrictions ) to own property in any amount , especially the means of production , as the basis for economic security . Let us digress to say that Hamilton , who is criticized by the " Liberals " for his concern about property , and his lack of confidence in poor people , was not unique in that respect . However , he , evidently , realized more fully than his contemporaries that no matter how intelligent people are , their judgment is not trustworthy where self-interest is involved , especially if they are under the pressure imposed by distress , hunger and poverty . Those who criticize him are generally the " liberals " who are making a good living at the expense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the voters are in confusion . It is not unfair to say that statesmen working for sound government today are subjected to the same criticisms that Hamilton received . However , they are contending with far more powerful and vicious influences than he faced . Of course restoration of the channels of business was the  | only way to remedy the situation . Healthy business eliminated unemployment and the need for charity . Healthy business also made it possible for citizens to pay their debts , make themselves independent of government doles , and , besides , make their government strong . The Forefathers tried to bring about that result by giving citizens more freedom in property ownership ? freeing commercial property from arbitrary government control . They , therefore , made their rules for voting , for elections , the courts , short term of office , legislators and enforcement officers with a view to promote and protect business . ' They were practical enough to realize that there would always be a substantial amount of favoritism , downright corruption and graft . They hoped to remedy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for political favoritism had always waxed fat through corrupt government monopolies . It was that unsavory practice which made it possible for the merchants of England to compel the colonies to trade with the mother country , and also preclude them from manufacturing at home or contacting foreign markets . As the beneficiaries of the practice controlled the ballot there was not much chance for relief through that function . To what extent they controlled matters may be gathered from the fact that in 1872 a bill was passed disfranchising Revenue Collectors ( government officials ) and excluding from the House of Commons the contractors , ? the five-percenters . The Forefathers , apparently were confronted with the same problems that plague the world today and always will . For instance , the governmental favorites of the old British Empire have their counterpart today in over-protected utilities , unwholesome patronage and other favored groups , including Footnote  | labor unions , notwithstanding the recent legislation . ' The Forefathers would consider such arrangements as contrary to the principles of what they called free enterprise under the laissez faire doctrine . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use if the opportunity for a citizen to earn a decent living on his merits as a producing unit is to be properly protected . ' ( See page 60 for footnotes 5 and 6 . ) Henry Hazlitt 's suggestion with respect to disfranchisement referred to on page 65 needs careful analysis . Indeed all economists and statesmen subscribe to his proposition . Only a dishonest politician refuses to endorse it . But if this legislation called " liberal " law forces such a change in the franchise , how can it be called constitutional ? And if it is unconstitutional it probably will defeat economic security ? its alleged objective . The bitter experience that merchants had with governmental interference is reflected in the constitutional set-up to bring about free enterprise ? the right of the citizens to own the means of production and to trade with other citizens anywhere in the world , without special or unwholesome protection to anyone from the government . Achievement of that goal , as already suggested , was sought through observing principles long recognized but difficult to honor , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free elections , short term of office and the scaredness of contracts or of private property . These principles , of course , involve the free enterprise philosophy that the individual be responsible to himself for his economic security , that there shall be no law-decreed limitation upon the amount of property he may acquire , that-taxation shall be only for the usual functions of government , and that local matters be taken care of by communities , townships , cities , counties and states , according to their readily recognized sphere of influence . What should be considered the functions and sphere of in-  | Footnote  | fluence of government in connection with promoting business ( security ) constituted the real knot , still does , and always will . And one can not fail to see that many things which had to be considered as private , local and state matters in 1789 , in order to promote business ( protect security ) must now , for that purpose , be considered national matters , and even international , and there is nothing in the Constitution which prevents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be obvious that crop control , price control , control of hours of work , closed shop laws , subsidies , etc. , can readily be pushed to a point where they adversely affect public welfare and , therefore , become unconstitutional in spirit as well as in the letter of the law . It is certain that the Fathers did not intend that the voters should be direct beneficiaries of government bounty to the extent they are today , or that government officials should play such an important part in the investment of the money of the taxpayer or the conducting of his business . According to the " Liberals " there was no danger in the early days of overproduction , gouging the public , or retarding production , and , therefore , controls of the character they recommend were not necessary . But the laws restraining monopolies prove the contrary . And just like today , the government official was the greatest offender in gouging the public and retarding production . It seems that no matter how many persons are starving and homeless , labor leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Modifying the evil by better means of distribution gets little attention . When there are no more destitute it will be proper for the government to worry about overproduction and try to prevent it by food destruction , five-day weeks , high unemployment awards , a large Army and Navy , unrestrained strikes , low norms of production , slow-downs and featherbedding. '  | Footnote  | However , the Forefathers were trying to create an economic structure which gave the citizen the right to acquire wealth lawfully in any amount under open competition , and thus stimulate business so there would be no necessity for governmental charity or subsidies aimed at discouraging production . They were well aware of the economic disadvantages which developed from competition , but they also realized that wealth had to be concentrated to give it the strength it had to have to produce in the quickest , cheapest and best way possible . Failure in that respect would bring the maximum of distress . ' The problem was how to keep wealth ( commercial power ) and political power from merging into one place ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Forefathers evidently were persuaded that the best way to solve the complex problems that threatened security was to keep the three branches of government on an equal footing and in their usual places ; keep the right to vote within the rule of equal responsibility , equal benefits , and equal knowledge of the subject matter ; keep public sentiment and majority rule under proper checks , and particularly observe the principles of short terms of office and control of local matters for local authority . That , apparently , in their judgment constituted representive government and the best way to promote public welfare . Their solution was not perfect . Concentrated wealth and concentrated political power continue to be a source of abuse and oppression . The Premises of the " Liberals " At this point it is proper to introduce the major premise of the " Liberals . " They believe that the remedy for poverty and misery is to bring the means of production ( property ) completely , or at least more fully , under the control or man-  | agement of an " elected " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be discussed under : Elections , Short term of office , States , Courts , Individuals , Independent Government , and the Crux of the matter . Effect Upon Elections Their confidence in a government official , as a manager of business , is based upon the theory that he is elected , or represents one who was elected , and will therefore respond to the majority . ( As though minorities were not entitled to consideration , or that majorities are always right . The United States Constitution of course does not provide , by elections or otherwise , for " political managers of business . " However , the Russian ballot , used by the " Liberals " as an example for their propositions regarding " elected " management , has far less significance than the ballot in the United States . The Soviet builders appreciated the danger inherent in the franchise . They , therefore , gave the Russian ballot nominal weight in connection with the election of the officials responsible for the economic life of Russia . Of course each step that government takes toward regulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel dependent upon the government for jobs , contracts , loans , relief , pensions , food , clothes and shelter . That creates a relationship between them and their government which , when there are a great many of them , should preclude them from using the ballot , except in a very indirect manner ? the Russian style . In the manner that the ballot is used in the United States it takes only a small percentage of the voters receiving government benefits to destroy the proper relation between the government and the citizen from the standpoint  | of protecting public welfare . ' A person seeing an opportunity to obtain a substantial benefit , especially if he is in need , will naturally resolve everything in his favor to obtain that benefit . That he will take such a course even without need , is the implication in every contract , compact , charter , constitution or law . Voters dependent upon government for their contracts , social and political positions , business privileges , homes , shelter , food and jobs , because of self-interest , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public welfare . As it is their own act , there is only praise for the government 's conduct , no matter how corrupt . And let it be repeated that under such circumstances free speech ( criticism of government ) automatically disappears , is completely destroyed , and in the absence of free speech there is no economic security . The leaders of social democracies , therefore , although they deny it , soon take the steps necessary to nullify the ballot by making it mere gesture procedure . It is not done because they are vicious . It is the only course open to them to save such security as remains . Could there be a more fantastic conception of government than the popular idea of electing " political managers " of business ? But is not that the very course into which the various " deals " are driving the United States ? Is not the Chief Executive , in fact , already a general director of interstate business ? For instance , his authority in connection with strike procedure . Effect Upon Short Term of Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | which would prevent government from entering , regulating or controlling daily life and business affairs along the lines now recommended and practiced , is further established by their short term of office principle , as distinguished from the present life tenures by " fixed " elections . The life tenures of past rulers made it possible for them to have lifetime business favorites , with the usual adverse affect on public welfare . No doubt , it was believed that short term of office would greatly reduce such situations ? prevent powerful groups or individuals , in the name of public welfare , liberalism , etc. , from getting too much control of government . With a potential change in administration every two , four or six years , it would not be practical to have elected government officials too closely related to business . To change the key-men , or the men in actual control of business by popular vote would jeopardize stability of business too much ? would destroy the nation because of industrial stagnation . Under such circumstances no one would care to invest money or effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced complete government control , a situation which eliminates private property and consequently does not require money in the true sense of the word . They believed that such a course would eliminate worry about profit , depressions , and over-production . Incidentally private industry does not develop in Western Europe because of the threat of Russian confiscation ? abolition of property , as well as money , in the conventional sense of those words.1 ? " Liberalism " has brought on a similar fear in the United States ? the fear that government control will advance so far 10 That situation made , and still makes it impossible for Russia to join or accept the world bank idea . Her money system is entirely foreign to what was contemplated at the New Hampshire Conference .  | that private property loses its significance . Because of lack of confidence in investment opportunities , banks pay a very nominal return on savings , etc . Business is reluctant to expand because there is no assurance that the same men will continue in office , or that the government can proceed with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing everything . Such a situation creates stagnation because neither the government nor the business man can determine which way to move . In the absence of " fixed " elections , making a change in key-men improbable , the only investments that keep the country alive are those underwritten by taxpayers , often without their consent , and generally of such a character that no intelligent banker would accept them . Of course , the taxpayers underwrite these investments whether they want to or not . The " peoples " government politely ( tyranically ? ) assumes that they want to invest and that they want the government official to spend and invest their money in various ways ! As suggested , the Russians solved these problems by abolishing the right to own property and discarding conventional money . The latter an unavoidable result . The low interest on public debt is often pointed to as a benefit derived from " modified " government control . But what is gained in that way is lost three-times over in low interest on saving accounts , absence of accounts , lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the threat of possible abolition of property ? government assuming too much control over the means of production . The same trends occurred in Germany . Her communistic or totalitarian social experimentations ( at first called social democracy ) started with " liberal " laws of the character highly  | Footnote  | recommended by Stuart Chase , Y " and accordingly endorsed by the Newdeal . But before many years had passed , to meet her obligations she was compelled to steal the trade of smaller countries , resort to barter and exchange because of corrupted money , and eventually plunge the world into war . Nothing short of civil war could have driven Hitler from his exalted position . The short term of office principle had been completely destroyed by " fixed " elections . His life-term grip on office came by way of social reforms of the same character as those embraced by Italy , Russia , Great Britain and the United States.12 The NRA may be used as a further illustration of the proposition that the short-term of office principle must be abandoned if the government-in-business tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years , it certainly would have involved complete control of business by trained government officials . Changing officials so intimately connected with business under a short office term , controlled by general elections , would wreck any commercial program . A governmental set-up of that character requires an unbroken policy . It is as impracticable to change such an administration by way of elections as it would be to have military leaders elected by ballot , or industrial leaders elected every two years by the employees . The relationship to the undertaking by the responsible person is of a character which precludes relying upon voters who , no matter how noble or intelligent they are , are not in a position to grasp the issues . That changing policies would involve too much danger was admitted during the presidential campaigns . The Republican party wanted to keep the machinery ? only change the engineer . But there were too many voters who were afraid to change . That accounts for keeping an engineer who was in poor health , and certainly suggests that he had a life-time  | Footnote  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , and that others now enjoy . Like Roosevelt and Truman , future presidents will be confronted with the same situation . A primary danger in these arrangements is that even under a nominal program , the leader can easily allege or introduce the emergencies which will make him the indispensable man . If he is a normally ambitious individual , it is to be expected that he will do so . In that respect , Mark Anthony and Caesar were not unique characters ; neither were Hitler , Mussolini , or Stalin . Constitutional prohibitions are inadequate . There is therefore in that kind of government , whether it is NRA , AAA , or OPA , the seed of perpetuity in office ? the death of elections , democratic government . Under such circumstances , without any reflection upon intelligence , integrity or patriotism , elections are bound to degenerate into stampedes for governmental benefits ; are bound to create a relationship between the citizen and his government that makes elections of the American type too dangerous and results under any election procedure in one-party rule , life-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually by fear , fraud , graft and corruption . Effect Upon the States Moreover , such a type of government throws out of balance the intended constitutional relationship between states and the federal government , especially with respect to local responsibility  --  -a fundamental democratic principle . " It is impossible to administer the NLRA , the Wage and Hour Act , the present agricultural acts , and the general subsidies to business and the States , including pensions and relief , and not reduce the States to administrative organs . Their citizens are obliged to look to Federal policies for their privileges and benefits . Their courts and laws are obliged to follow Federal policies . The Supreme Court 's condemnation of the NRA and the AAA are pertinent .  | The unavoidable consequences of these programs is to increase corruption because the responsible authority is too far away to administer effective rebukes or remove the cause . Political divisions such as states are the usual and necessary consequences of government . The Constitution excels all other documents in defining the jurisdiction of such divisions . The doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the inhabitants in the vicinity are best qualified to determine the laws necessary for local business , charity and morals . There is always confusion as to where local government should terminate and centralized government begin . That confusion not only called into existence charters and constitutions , but caused a lot of bloodshed , including the Civil war . It is not so much that the terms in the charters are not clear . The difficulty arises because human beings , minds swayed by self-interest , are bound to interpret words so as to increase their own power . Language is not sufficient to restrain them . The provisions in the Constitution with respect to the jurisdiction of states are of such a character that changes in the economic structure do not require alterations . The cases referred to on page 70 establish that . Justice Marshall was contending with the usual matters of government . Today the contention is about the lack of integrity of business men , their " high " integrity when they become government officials , and the new idea that the tax payers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no hardships . That raises new questions . How far can the Federal Government advance with the new ideas without impairing the foundation of democracy ( economic security ) ? local government ? The lawyers tried to stop the stampede to federal control by using the Commerce Clause , the Due Process Clause and the Contract Clause . Those phrases applied to Marshall 's prob-  | lems , but not to the problems confronting them . They really had only one issue : These laws defeat economic security.15 Effect Upon the Courts The proper relation between the government and the courts is destroyed by this kind of government , even as matters stand today . The Constitution is based upon a proposition that judges can not be independent if too much of the litigation is between the citizen and his government . It was the futility of pleading for relief in civil matters before the King 's judges ( the government owning most of the property ) that caused the Forefathers to plan so carefully to have a structure under which the citizen did not have to contend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otherwise , when a judge undertakes to decide a case , he is obliged to antagonize , or at least oppose , the government 's economic policies as occurred in the Newdeal cases and brought on the court " purge . " That is too difficult a position for a judge . Under such circumstances he , generally , supports the administration and will abuse the citizen who is foolhardy enough to complain . The judges would have to be much more than humanitarians to justify anyone in expecting any other attitude.lsa But , nevertheless , it is a reflection on the integrity of every judge , president and congressman , if he does not make constant protest to such a violation of democratic government . Obviously , under the form of government advocated by the Footnote  | Footnote  | " Liberals " , the appointment of judges for life has an effect opposite to what the Forefathers aimed at . They become administrative helpers , instead of checks upon arbitrary conduct of the legislative or executive branches . Such an arrangement calls for short term of office for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution.16 At least , no one has been able to suggest a way of keeping judges independent , in the true sense of the word , when government is closely tied into every phase of daily life as is now , generally , the case . Are not the numerous governmental agencies acting in a three-fold capacity evidence to that effect ? The cry of the " liberal " is that ownership of private property makes the judges too subservient to private individuals . But , apparently , the government control recommended by the " liberals " only aggravates the matter complained about . Effect on the Individual When government assumes all the responsibilities now urged upon it and being rapidly embraced by it , it soon finds itself in a position where it can not consider as paramount the individual 's inherent rights.17 It then in time of peace , as in war , if it continues such procedure long enough , has to assign his job , ration his food and clothes , restrict his associations , stipulate his hours of work , specify his wages 18 and either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be difficult , for even the intelligent German did not realize that such was true until it was too late . That kind of government is keyed to military procedure and has to abandon the constitutional conception of free speech , separation of church and state , protection against seizure of property , court procedure and elections . A military organization when threatened with immediate destruction can not use  | Footnote  | elections , or civil courts , or honor an individual 's religious convictions . The advocates of these new forms of government , especially the kind Wallace represents , apparently do not realize that they are asking that wartime powers be granted in peacetime.20 With so many urging government to plunge or wade deeper into ownership and direction of business , it can not be repeated too often that such a course will destroy the four freedoms for the great majority and expose them to the ravaging of the four monsters , corruption , waste , want and war . It certainly is not the road to democracy ! It brought the people of Italy and Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these two nations were gradually led toward absolute government control of the means of production ? a form of government under which the citizen does not have a real constitution , or worthwhile courts and parliaments , and is allowed ownership only in a very nominal amount of property , with the consequence that money becomes merely a token for exchange purposes , and in a very limited field at that . The Russians , it should be observed , started with the maximum of government control and are gradually working in the opposite direction ! Effect Upon Independent Government These forms of government can not survive unless other countries conform to the same standards.21 Stalin and Trotsky made that proposition the basis of their campaigns . Later , Stalin shrewdly , but deceitfully , preached to the contrary . His attacks upon capitalism proved his deceitfulness . Nevertheless Americans believed his words . The Russian party members knew better . They continued to compel governments to follow their ideas , even if they had to overthrow them . It is not that they want to rule the world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations adopt the  | same style of government . And is not the United States subscribing to that principle in its protests against certain forms of government in Europe and Asia ? It also has accepted dependent government . It can not for long survive economically on its " slow-downs " , high wages , unrestricted strike policies , short work weeks , etc. , if the other nations , with adequate machinery , are on a six-day week and a low wage scale , or use , what for lack of a better term , must be called government " slave labor . " The high cost of production in the United States will make impossible profitable commercial exchanges with the cheap " slave-labor " economic structures . It will force permanent Marshall Plans , plus war-breeding situations , as well as isolationism by way of tariffs and other means of exclusion of cheap labor commodities.L2 One might digress enough to say that labor leaders are isolationists when it comes to preventing aliens from coming to the United States . States . The forefathers built the Constitution on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production ) under the conviction that such a structure would produce the best in the quickest and cheapest way possible . The Crux of the Matter Government control or " planning " , as contemplated by the " liberals " , as already suggested , is based on the proposition that it will , with fewer hardships produce more cheaply , better and more quickly than free enterprise as conceived by the Forefathers , or by the present-day conservatives . Therefore , the question is which method is the most effective . There is no yardstick to determine when government " planning " has converted a free enterprise structure into a Footnote  | social democracy , communism , or totalitarianism , or when " planning " has advanced so far that it will force complete government control of the means of production , as in Russia . But this distinction appears to be obvious : The " planners " put their emphasis for control of the means of production upon the judgment of government officials . This is primarily on the ground that a government official is not under a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , such factors are offset by the fact that such officials are not financially responsible for their recommendations or conduct , can not be sued , or made to keep their promises , and have at their command the Army and Navy as well as the judges and legislators . In lieu of the profit urge is the " political power " urge . Moreover , under such circumstances , the ballot becomes an accelerator of complete government control , whereupon the worker can not acquire property such as real estate or business , including farms and banks . Under such an arrangement the ballot must be neutralized , and it becomes necessary to appeal to the workers ' patriotism , or threaten them , in order to stimulate production . ( Stalin , in disregard of communism , introduced " government privileges " to stimulate production . ) The advocates of free enterprise stress the judgment of individuals financially responsible for their conduct , who have to pay for their mistakes , who may be sued and who do not have the Army and Navy at their command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law makers . They believe that industrialists , private citizens , under the limitations referred to , notwithstanding the " profit urge " will be in the best position to direct the economic policies of a country . To stimulate production the worker is offered wages ( money ) with which he may acquire property in any amount , and be free from government doles , etc.  | Free enterprise ( not the present concoction ) was chosen by the Forefathers because the past proved that when politicians , persons not financially responsible for their conduct , directed the economic policy , misery and poverty increased ten-fold . Such is still the result . As an illustration : The politicians try to catch up with their promises by decreeing a minimum wage . Before a decade elapses they have to double that wage , and the doubled wage will not purchase as much as the original . The **25;1567;TOOLONG unemployment pay has shrunk in purchase value to $10 , and the thirty-dollars-a-day laborer , can not afford to buy the things he makes . The greatest injustice befalls insurance beneficiaries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their life-time investments already have lost more than half their value . Obviously there has not been much progress so far as relief from distress and misery is concerned.23 It is a difficult program . Eggs , butter , potatoes , meat , milk , cotton and wool , must be destroyed , given away or put in storage , in order to go on with the dance . If there are any benefits , they will be temporary and eventually will have to be paid for thrice over . What an opportunity for ridicule of free enterprise ( capitalism ) by the Russians . Under this heading the matter of the relationship of the citizen to government in " social " democracies should be examined . It can not avoid a system which gives a government official a prerogative of determining whether a business of any character shall start , develop or terminate . Could one conceive of a more dangerous situation , so far as public welfare is con-cerned ? Footnote  | Moreover , because he stands in the position of owner and employer , when economic distress develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect . o jobs , food and shelter . Civil war and revolution are the inevitable result , for the government is a primary party to the controversies and the power to be blamed . The wrath against the government is sure to materialize , for it is the government that caused them to invest in the bankrupt organization , that forecloses on their mortgages , drives them from their homes , reduces their wages , abolishes their jobs and withholds their food . The hate and malice and bitterness engendered by the collapse instead of being directed against a private individual or a private corporation , as would be the case under free enterprise , is directed toward government . What else could result but civil war under such circumstances ? Civil war is inevitable for there is no neutral tribunal or arbitrator , The government is a party to the controversy . The citizen therefore is confronted with a force ( the government ) which has no superior ? from which there is no appeal , except the one to Heaven ? the sword . Because the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " humanitarianism " , they are apt to be the first to draw the sword to defend their position . It was hoped that free enterprise would avoid such unfortunate consequences . It was an attempt to create a situation that when distress overtook a nation the wrath of the disappointed would be directed against a private citizen or corporation , and the government would be in a position to act as a neutral tribunal , that is , not be a party to the controversy . How else could one expect to maintain sound government ? Of course , free enterprise also involves the presumption that a person financially responsible for his conduct will use better judgment  | Footnote  | and get better results when promoting business than a government official . The position of the " Liberal " that there will be fewer depressions and a substantial reduction of hardships when government has charge of business as outlined by them has no foundation whatever . Democracies ( enterprise free from government control of the kind in question ) were born as a protest to the permanent depressions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not unfair to say that the " liberals " are reluctant to make comparisons.24 That their leaders ( dictators ) , as distinguished from those of the past , are elected is no answer , for such elections soon degenerate into fictions , frauds and subterfuge . It must be borne in mind that systems which stimulate government control of industry or the means of production have a tendency to create war , and consequently , permanent destitution for the majority , and , of course , more hardships . 2 . No government that has undertaken in such manner to adjust the hardships which arise in maintaining commercial supremacy has been nimble enough to avoid taking complete charge of business . When it does the subjects will find that the taskmaster they have is many times more heartless and arbitrary than the private corporation.25 Such a result is inevitable , for the master will be a human being who may act without financial responsibility and is equipped with unlimited ( sovereign ) power , and who in order to be effective must have control of the courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under free enterprise , unfortunately , it also happens that unscrupulous men get too much control of governmental functions . No statesman hopes to remedy that evil completely .  | Footnote  | But constitutional government was conceived as the best way to destroy such influences without resorting to civil war or causing governmental collapse , and by constitutional government ( free enterprise ) is meant independent courts , independent legislative bodies , short term of office , carefully protected local jurisdiction , and an economic structure under which the citizen does not have to contend with government for the daily necessities of life , or look to it for his job , home , or food , and with the ballot directed so as to protect private property . In other words , citizens in general dependent upon private industry for the necessities of life . It is dangerous enough to grant " unrestricted " right of property accumulation under the limitations imposed by competition . But nothing has been more destructive to security than to combine political and commercial power in the manner advocated by the " liberals " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constitutional governments , are supposed to prevent ! However , today the merging of these powers into one channel ? political power , is falsely called democracy by the " liberals " ; probably not with evil intent because they claim the merging of these powers will alleviate the hardships which befall man in building and maintaining a civilization . If in the past combining these powers had softened hardships beyond a very temporary period , informed persons would not be so skeptical . Government and business were already too closely linked in 1929 . It seems that men are trying to remedy the situation by a complete surrender of private enterprise to political control . They tried that in the past.26 The futile attempts of the present are reflected in France , Italy , Germany and Russia . The frequent reoccurrence would suggest that it is a chronic malady . It  | always results in a relationship which makes it impossible for the employer to recognize merit by adequate wage rewards . There is already an undercurrent of feeling that because of governmental interference inefficiency reaps the best rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . One more straw may be too much . The communists taught themselves a lesson in that field during the reign of terror from about 1918 to 1923 , when they liquidated those who had been successful in business and in the professions , on the ground that their rewards had been too great . It resulted in a " minimum " wage law for everybody . They considered that it was most unfair to have a minimum wage law for certain groups , as in the United States . Minimum Wage Laws Make a Vicious Circle The minimum wage laws , of course , are attempts along the line of adjusting inequities . But some of the difficulties arising under them should be checked in connection with this chapter . Under such laws those just above the minimum wage , but who do not receive an increase , are subjected to a rise in the cost of living under circumstances which amount to a cut in wages for them ? certainly a hardship . The consequence is a demand for adjustments. , Since there is nothing to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment is in order . The next group feels the same disadvantage . If justice is to be done there must follow an upward swing along the line until it reaches the top . When it does , all the groups are again in the same relative position ! That makes a circle ? a vicious one . Labor union policy makes the whole program futile by demanding and obtaining higher wages and shorter hours for their groups before the minimum wage laws can take effect . The  | Communists , not Stalin , want to solve that problem by paying everybody the same amount ? equalitarianism ! It seems that this circle affects most adversely those in the professional or academic fields as it gives to ordinary or common manual labor ( in many instances improperly called " skilled " ) higher pay than those trained in colleges . That is a sure result , since labor becomes a political commodity ? a political commodity because it represents a substantial block of votes . It therefore , becomes the center of attraction for the " duly " elected legislators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to democracy in such a situation is obvious to all except the beneficiaries.21 As the principal beneficiaries are labor leaders , inspectors and politicians , there is no way to break the circle . These laws raise a problem in foreign commerce . There never develops among the wage-earners a sentiment in favor of reducing wages . That would be expecting too much of human beings . As wage-earners represent a voting majority , all Congress or the administrators can do , if they wish to hold their positions , is to accept the recommendations of the labor leaders with respect to higher wages and shorter hours . No commercial structure , even if it had world-wide support , could withstand such pressure . No Russian leader even is suggesting anything that silly . Nations with an economic structure keyed to a more practical arrangement , Russia 's slave labor for instance , get a trade advantage . That leaves the alternatives for the " Social Democracies " of destroying the competing nations in order to maintain their trade , or abandoning the Footnote  | Footnote  | less practical approach.28 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laws of that nature eventually lead to the European idea of " full employment " , which is already being introduced into the United States by way of the backdoor.29 Under it , however , independent courts , independent legislative bodies and free elections can not be maintained . That situation makes it possible to eliminate strikes or any substantial opposition to government plans and , for a temporary period , may be most effective . But eventually it increases intrastate , interstate , and international clashes as evidenced by the results in Germany and Italy , and by the imperialistic and , at the same time , isolationistic attitude of Russia . And it must be borne in mind that war creates permanent poverty . There is another danger in this kind of legislation which can not be side-stepped . If one can see that in the field of business men have no mercy for the weak , it should not be difficult to realize that they will also have no mercy for the weak in the field of politics . That rule applies to states . The day it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states which control legislation , that a certain kind of business could be transferred to them advantageously , the transfer is as good as made . A transfer can be forced by a minimum wage variation of one cent an hour . That is what makes the South apprehensive of a wage law . The FEPC carries similar possibilities for the South . ( What could be more silly than a law which implies business men must be forced to employ efficient personnel ? ) The result is that the Federal Government becomes a party to a scheme to despoil a group of weak states . There is no way of stopping such trade paralyzing and war creating procedure , for it is always proposed in the name of humanity , unity , and public welfare ; the promotors pose , of course , as de-  | Footnote  | fenders of the Constitution ( justice ) , and good government ? democratic government . It should be obvious even to " liberals " that such legislation is prone to breed civil war because of its possible trade-discriminating and interfering character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil wars during the period of the Confederation , and the period prior to the Civil War 30 and the Civil War.30a The principle of the Declaration of Independence that governments that are unjust ( and they all are that in the eyes of those under a disadvantage ) must be destroyed has never been abrogated . It lies dormant until a majority or a minority ignore it too long , too often and too much . Persons not familiar with business do not realize how the additional cost of a few pennies a day in wages can force it into bankruptcy or oblige it to move to another location . Therefore , all that is necessary under the wage and hour law to cripple another section is to raise wages a few cents an hour . If men , human beings , in private industry do not hesitate to destroy the industry of an associate or to abuse employees , why should one be so simple as to believe they will not do it through legislation ? Besides , it is generally not possible to demonstrate that a business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . The wage and hour law was not chosen for discussion because it is particularly bad , but because it lends itself readily to showing some of the difficulties that confront governments . Such laws represent the rockbottom of pessimism . They are an open and profound admission that a great many will always be on the verge of destitution . In this case , by direction of the government . The Communists , as stated before , recognized the consequences of such procedure and therefore tried to adjust matters by decreeing that there should be absolute uniform-  | ity with respect to wages and ownership of property ? equalitarianism . That procedure eliminates money in the usual sense of that word . The functional peculiarities of legislative assemblies should not be overlooked . They have so many close and sympathetic relationships , as well as most practical ones , among their members that it is usually futile , if not impossible , to stand up in the Chambers and say this measure is objectionable for these reasons ? the real ones . Generally the only way to obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly or by intuition , i.e. , " you vote for my proposition and I will vote for yours . " That difficulty was fully understood by the Forefathers . It is obviously one of the reasons why government can not successfully enter business management , or , if it does undertake it , is obliged to submerge courts and legislators to the extent prevailing in these days throughout the world . It should be repeated that the idea of three branches of government is not a new one . Government naturally has three divisions , law-making , law-interpreting and law-enforcing . The Forefathers clarified the jurisdiction of these three branches . The conflicts which rage about the matter arise because human beings resent limitations upon their political powers . And let it be emphasized again and again that free enterprise ( the only sure protection against tyranny ) involves the right of the citizen to acquire enough property to be free from the necessity of doles and pensions . It also involves local ( state ) government and depends upon maintaining three branches of government , separated as contemplated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a strategic position to usurp authority and should have its powers most clearly defined . It is generally overlooked that the ballot is involved in this ancient principle  | because it requires determining who may vote , the matters to be voted upon , and term of office . It must be remembered that the primary purpose of the Constitution was to impose substantial checks on the divine right of state . It did not abolish it . Governments always have areas where citizens are subject to the personal judgment and selfrestraint of the ruler . And it must be remembered , also , that the checks were imposed to protect economic security for all . English history proved that whether the leader was a religious Stewart or a religious Cromwell , excessive power only brought excessive abuse for those not in the shadow of politicial favoritism . Reasons Why Government Management is Inefficient That the matter complained of ( inefficiency ) must be real is established by the general conviction , since the memory of man , that it is true . The Constitution , which tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this conviction is not based on fiction . One reason for the inefficiency is that the relationship of a government official to business , either as owner , regulator or director , is not adapted to produce good results . He can never be , generally , at a financial loss in the matter for he is not financially responsible for his mistakes . He may with impunity recommend shorter hours or higher wages , call for new equipment , a different location , a particular day or subject for bargaining ; for , regardless of results , he is not confronted with the possibility of direct financial loss . It amounts to having a  | person who is not responsible telling the responsible person what to do ! That generally is a most unwise procedure , certainly , not democratic . Moreover , everybody likes to be popular . The employees are in the majority and are voters . That fact should make any honest person aware that the ballot has to be abandoned , or at least curtailed , when government enters business to the extent that many suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it puts a government official in a position , in the name of public welfare , to destroy any business that incurs the ill-will of an administration . The relationship is conducive to carelessness from the standpoint of expense . It is not necessary to make ends meet out of profits . Deficiencies are made up through the Treasury . Bankruptcy does not confront any of these " servants of the people " as long as government is able to collect taxes for their salaries and what they recommend . Elections are no threat to their procedure , for the voter imagines he is a beneficiary . The scope of action or authority of the government official has to be considered . Not only is he not financially responsible , but he represents sovereignty ? unlimited power . What a situation ! A person not financially responsible , but with unlimited power , directing the one , if there is any private business left , financially responsible , but without power to resist . No one can stay his hand , especially when he represents a totalitarian form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of business and commerce ? which appears to be the objective of the " liberals . " But such a situation makes Hitlers and Molotovs no matter what their nationality may be . This sovereign power makes it possible for the government  | representatives , without liability , to do almost anything ? things which would send a private citizen to jail . For instance , a private citizen can not have a monopoly except under very limited circumstances . The government , however , is under no such restraint . A private concern , if the Union will tolerate it , may discharge an individual only for cause ; but the government can hire and fire without limitation , and can impose a $10,000 fine , or five years in jail , upon a citizen trying to make an honest living for selling too cheap , too high , too much or not enough . Private corporations , of course , are confronted with anti-trust laws if they try to control the market for " public welfare " purposes , but not the government . Another reason why government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult to check the books and records of a government agency than those of a private citizen . The plea of public interest can prevent an investigation , and , if an investigation is made , it is but one branch of the government checking on the other , in reality the government checking itself . How can one expect efficiency under such circumstances ? Either there is no investigation , or the investigation degenerates into political persecution . There is a supposition that the government official will be fairer than a business man in dealing with employees and the public because he is not under a profit urge . But profit only represents power . And certainly the power urge is intensified , for these kinds of government offer unlimited power to whoever gets on top . No doubt the ambitious " Liberal " senses that opportunity for power . He makes himself believe that his enthusiasm for government control is born entirely out of his concern for the downtrodden ! But it is the urge for power that is the basis for the blood purges . The communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote  | try to create a structure under which profit ( money or other evidence of property ) would not be such an impulse . They found , however , that money ( a symbol of property over which the owner has complete control ) was not only a medium of exchange but a peculiar kind of exchange which tolerated no limitations on the right of transfer or exchange for other kinds of property , and that the lethergy impulses arising in the worker because of limitations on his right to exchange his pay for property , created more hardships than profit impulses . To offset the lethergy , an appeal was made to patriotism . That appeal was not properly responded to . Penalties therefore were imposed upon persons who failed or made mistakes . But that was too dangerous for a worker 's life . No matter how efficient he was , he was always in jeopardy because of some unscrupulous or too ambitious associate seeking position power ( the essence of profit ) without regard for public welfare . No matter which way the system was used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jungle than the profit system , and , besides , it brought stagnation.31 The tangents referred to are bound to develop because the human race recoils from furnishing all the sweat and blood and tears that civilization demands as the price of progress . The profit motive that is feared so much is but a branch on the tree of merit . Nothing short of all the endurance in him can make a musician ; his fame is his profit.32 In the event his talent is entirely natural , that only raises the tempo for one with less talents who wants to succeed . Ten thousand musicians have to fail ( play a subordinate part ) to make one master . That is the price of civilization in every vocation and walk of life , including religion , business and government . Another factor that handicaps government in conducting business is that the attitude of the employee toward the public  | is not such as to stimulate further contacts . His customers have to come to him ; there is no other place to go . His capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency . His regulations therefore result in only one brand of corn , soup , beans , one pair of trousers , so much pork , so much beef , so much milk , no butter . Italy , Germany and Russia had such regulations in time of peace . Tremendous influences are working to introduce , enlarge and keep them in the United States . The Social Democrats or " Liberals " believe in rationing everything ? especially the poor man 's portion of work . The only thing they do not want to ration is their own political power ? the exact opposite of democracy or constitutional government . Public Service agencies are held up as examples of efficiency . However , their efficiency emanates from the spirit and practice of free enterprise which surrounds them.33 Should government assume control of everything , not an unusual recommendation in these days , the free enterprise checks of competition would disappear , and with them efficiency . The Director then is certainly not going to be astute in cutting expenses , for he is not financially responsible and often , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel is increased or contracts granted . Bribery is not being discussed ? just the normal consequences that develop between friends without anything being mentioned or deliberately planned . Hardships and Business No economic structure can prevent property , liberty , freedom , position , fame ( security ) , from being subjected to failure , fiction , trickery and chance , and the attending hard-Footnote  | ships . The outcries against hardships , no doubt , represent the primitive rebelling against the veneer of civilization and against the sweat and energy involved in polishing the diamond . The hardships of poverty make it natural for the poor to hate the rich and to covet their wealth . The same relation exists between the poor and the rich with regard to talent , a hardship imposed by nature , and one that can not be adjusted so that everybody will be satisfied . The ideas of the Russian about elimination of the profit motive , or prohibiting citizens from owning property , aim at preventing anybody from becoming economically independent through the " exploitation " or hardships of others . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many politically " independent " through the exploitation of others ? It is a fantastic attempt to avoid the hardships that civilization imposes . If the industrialist is making his wealth produce what civilization has to have , his wealth or his profit is not the issue . The issue is , how can it be done with less hardships . The " liberals " want us to believe that government control will do a better job . But in either event there has to be concentration before there can be production . No matter how mean the employer is , or how great his profits are , if he is producing and turning his profits back into the channels of trade , benefits will flow to the public in spite of him.34 Fifty thousand persons under-paid and over-worked in private industry generally results in 50,000,000 getting a benefit in buying power , say cheaper automobiles . The same principle prevails when a million teenagers die on a battlefield to protect their country ? commerce ! If battlefield hard-Footnote  | ships for teenagers are unavoidable in protecting a civilization , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace time for the same reason . A complaint against an industry , in order to be valid , must show that its policies are detrimental to public welfare . One may complain about the blood on the battlefield only when it darkens the ground in vain . That much blood is shed in vain is true , and equally true is it that in industry much abuse prevails which should be eliminated . However , most of the bungling that creates abuse , in war or in peace , develops because the meddlers do not realize how difficult the problems are . Labor unions complain the most about hardships . But no groups of individuals have derived more benefits from cheap labor than high-priced union labor . That is why they keep themselves , or try to keep themselves , down to a nominal number by heavy membership fees . They also have trouble because each group selfishly , but naturally , tries to prove that its particular work is entitled to the highest pay ? an economic advantage ! However , although their race for higher wages and lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these groups are not more brutal than other special privilege groups . It is the business of government to see that such groups do not overreach . An argument for turning to a government official as a master business hand is that his lack of profit motive makes him neutral and therefore a fairer arbitrator or judge : a fundamental rule , but an improper application . A government official is not in the position of a neutral . He is serving a political master who is obliged to be more concerned with friends and favors than with the objective of making things better , more quickly and more cheaply than any other country or nation can .  | That is an objective which must be accomplished for commerce in times of peace ( if there is going to be " security " ) with the same urgency that military equipment has to be produced in times of war . Unfortunately , this will be done , in spite of everything to prevent it , with about the same amount of graft , hallabaloo , lying , cheating , fourflushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war , an undertaking discharged by government officials . The god of war , after all , is but the god of commerce in disguise . Three in One These " New Order " governments , as readily admitted by the " liberals " , force into one hand tremendous direct control of the courts , legislators and administrative officers . It is three combined in one , not three on an equal footing . There is only a dictator who in various ways is represented by agents dependent upon his will , who , in order to survive , must retain his favor . However , he is not in a position to exercise good judgment from the standpoint of developing commerce . His glamorous power ( profit ) draws to him too many advisers who want his favor for putting over something other than developing business . The mix-ups in the rubber industry , oil distribution , priorities , rationing , and drafting men for war should convince anybody of that tragic fact , if the past records of land-grabbing , bank-manipulating , and railroad frauds are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captains of free enterprise must be primarily concerned with promoting commerce . It is their life and fortune upon which they stake their money , reputation , happiness and existence . Their financial responsibility obliges them to be on the  | Footnote  | alert and qualifies them as directors . The harder they work at their objective ? promoting commerce , the better it is for a civilization composed of artists , poets , preachers , doctors , lawyers , educators , judges , laborers and labor leaders . It is only when capital backs away from production that civilization is in danger.35 It does seem to be overlooked that the happiness of people depends upon commerce , business ? a chance to make a decent living . The belittling remark of a Supreme Court Justice in connection with the sacrosanctness of business suggests that even that body lost sight of that fact . Social or economic security depends primarily upon a program that produces more cheaply , better and more quickly than any other nation , a most difficult assignment.36 Therefore , the proper attitude of democratic government toward business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much interference , what should be done . If he proves inadequate , one will search in vain for a competent director . The government subscribes to the theory that producing more cheaply , more quickly and better is the issue when it denies monopoly rights to the private citizen , for it means by such denial that open and free competition , free enterprise , is the foundation of social security . It also subscribes to the theory that the one in charge can not tolerate interference , for when it undertakes to run a business it demands unrestricted managing authority . It calls for manpower acts , work or fight acts , and seizure acts , hires and fires without limitation , and cuts away all opposition , even strikes . It invokes the old doctrine that government is holy and can do no wrong ? must have unchallenged authority , including the right to impose the hardships of war , in order to protect public welfare ? business . That is a correct and necessary principle in government ; but ,  | Footnote  | according to the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is always overlooked , denied , or not realized is that the same principles have to be applied to the industrialist if he is going to be in a position to keep business going well enough to give individuals a chance , some kind of a chance at least , to make a decent living ! However , his " holiness " is derived from the fact that he is financially responsible for his conduct . His field , in some respects , therefore , is broader ! 38 Too Many Government Clerks Spoil the Broth The idea that a government official is more humane and fair than a captain of industry with respect to employees and public welfare developed out of civil service practice . Civil Service employees had better wages , better hours and more job security than any other group . It was natural , therefore , to assume that if government had control of everything there would be an all around improvement . Of course 130,000,000 tax payers can support in luxury , or on a high standard , three or four hundred thousand government clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there will not be enough taxes to continue the advantage . Under such circumstances , the government official will have to become as brutal and as niggardly as a captain of private industry . Indeed , he will become much more so 37 because he represents sovereignty , a power which it has to be assumed can do no wrong , as is expressed in the current phrase " My country , right or wrong . " The outcry against dictatorship voices the fear of abuse of governmental authority . Footnote  | The reason why the government official becomes tyrannical , abusive , indifferent , calloused , brutal , dishonest , and drives government into bankruptcy , is that he is a human being made of the same clay as the business man , but one who , as already pointed out , has been put above courts , legislators , and public sentiment , and who is not financially responsible for his conduct . What could one expect under such circumstances but the maximum of injustice , abuse and oppression for those who failed to keep within government favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be otherwise , for a government official is not subject to the same checks as a private citizen . Generally , as the representative of government he can not be sued or imprisoned , or held financially responsible for damages caused by conduct , arbitrary ruling , or disastrous legislation , and is in a position to break contracts with impunity.39 Consequently , a government once started on these New Roads to Democracy soon degenerates , in spite of everything , into wealth-sharing programs by levying taxes for alleged social reforms which rush along so fast that they can not be arrested until bankruptcy overwhelms the government . The Constitution is evidence that the Forefathers saw there could be no more dangerous course to stability and prosperity than to make the government responsible to the citizen for his food , job , homes , profession wages , business , medicine , pensions and outright relief . Apparently they realized that under such a system courts and legislative bodies became useless , more room was made for the unscrupulous , and the most cruel system of all was imposed upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to believe they are humanitarians , with Footnote  | the maximum of power ; that under such a system the government eventually is pitted against its subjects , being called upon to sue them , foreclose on their mortgages , evict them , reduce their wages , close their shops , discharge them from em employment , and be a party to strikes ? all of which would destroy the good will a government must have from its citizens to be free from the terrors of civil war and the necessity of maintaining large military forces to keep its people in subjection . Could there be better examples to establish this than are furnished by the European turmoil ? The King Can Do No Wrong One can not escape the fact that responsibility and power must march together , and since government is not legally or morally responsible in many ways and fields for its mistakes , it is necessary to restrict its activities to the spheres where financial responsibility is not a prime factor . There is no way to make government responsible for its conduct , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be suggested that legislators be held financially responsible for damages sustained by legislation . But if that course were taken it is probable there would be no legislation at all . Besides , the consequences are so great that financial responsibility is impossible . Neither the President nor the Courts could be held to such a rule . Who could pay for the damages resulting to business by reason of the code practices imposed by NRA , or the damage that business sustained when the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional ? Suppose it should be proved that a war had been declared under improper motives ( not an unusual practice ) . The only redress the citizens would have for the loss of his property , his opportunities , or his sons and daughters , would be to impeach or refuse to  | reelect the offending person . That sure is inadequate compensation ! It is the old idea : " The king can do no wrong . " As there is no way to make a government financially responsible for its mistakes or conduct , it is presumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a direct obligation . That is the field of business , and that is what the Forefathers had in mind when they used the terms laissez faire , representative government , and free trade , now called free enterprise . The Constitution sets forth the checks which if utilized will keep government in its proper sphere of action . They are not new or novel checks , but the old ones which time has demonstrated are those which can be used most effectively . The Constitution is the authority ( king ) in the United States which in theory can do no wrong , and which must be obeyed if security ( business or commerce ) is to be properly protected . The House Divided Against Itself Must Fall One thing is sure : an economic structure can not endure if it has its commercial life divided in authority . It must either become a structure under which government has full control as in Russia , or be a structure wherein government is restricted to the ordinary functions prescribed by the Constitution . Such a structure , of course stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts dedicated to the function of adjusting disputes between citizens and citizens ( not government and citizen ) ; by keeping legislation inside the field of protecting free enterprise and the executive authority restricted to enforcing what the legislators and judges prescribe . Few persons would deny that today many opportunities to do business depends upon governmental favor , which can be obtained only by subscribing to certain governmental theories  | about economics . A lawyer in private practice hesitates to antagonize or disagree with the government because he meets the government on every corner . The worthwhile frontiers , are found in practice before the departments of the government . The lawyers certainly are not going to offend the power which controls the frontiers . That would be a foolish thing to do . The person seeking work in private industry is confronted with a government directed and protected labor union . ' ? His union affiliations mean more than his efficiency or his initiative ! His hours of work are set and his wages predetermined . He generally gets so much a day whether he is single or married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever his lot may be . The regimentation he invited finds him in an awkard position if he wants to cash in on his merit or his initiative . A new and most desirable frontier from the standpoint of remuneration ? the protected position of a union official , is not open to him . Notwithstanding the Taft-Hartley Act , the government is so vigoriously back of labor unions ( not laborers ) that business men can not successfully resist them . We are rapidly moving toward a structure where the only way a business man can open up a frontier is to subscribe to what the government dictates through its labor legislation regarding how many hours his employees may work , what he shall pay them , whom he shall employ , and under what circumstances they may paralyze his business by strikes . It was not , perhaps , intended to go that far , but once on the road , there was no place to stop . ( The Taft-Hartley Act may for a temporary period have a modifying Footnote  | effect . ) Obviously , commerce is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government will have to take full control of the whole program or be met , because of halfway methods , with confusion and stagnation , which means starvation and destitution for three-fourths of the citizens and ultimately submission to foreign influences from a more productive economic structure ? one with more sweat , blood and tears in the field of production , 41 and less of all three in the field of political purges and agitation . But more and more the frontiers , throughout the world , have to be sought in the field of governmental favoritism . That is not Democracy ! It is not good business . It is not public welfare ! It is the Russian way , and can only be effective for a short period of time . And let us repeat that no economic structure can avoid the terrible hardships which arise because of wars , inventions , natural catastrophes , miscalculations of leaders and human deficiencies regarding mental capacity and personal appearance . There is of course no constant measure for determining where governmental regulation or regimentation shall start or stop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every phase of the political and economic structure under its control ? no doubt , hated and resented by many for that very reason . But it may be safely assumed that when laws and regulations impair court independence , hamstring the legislators , interfere with local administration , nullify free elections , infringe upon Footnote  | free speech , restrict the amount of property a citizen may own , and curtail the right of industry to hire and fire , open and close , and to determine the price and quantities of its commodities , that then the Ship of State is far off its course , if it is proposed to sail to the land of economic security , liberty and freedom . There is , of couse , as often stated , no rule to determine when government regulation has introduced so many restrictions that it defeats its purpose ? economic security . But it is clear that security becomes a jest when government is out of bounds ? has flooded its banks ? is doing something in addition to acting as the umpire in property disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or can not respond to conventional moral codes , and keeping free and agreeable the relationships with other nations . Those three functions government must perform and always has performed . They are functions which can not be successfully administered otherwise than through sovereignty . And properly so , for they represent the area of authority where financial responsibility is not primarily involved ; could not be , because of the inmeasurable consequences . Business ( enterprise ) is holy , sacred ? first , because without the production of food , clothes and housing , civilization with its religions , cultures , arts , or anything else , must fail and disappear . Business ( producing commodities ) is therefore the first concern of government ; not to own it ; nor to regulate it ; but to stimulate it .  | KEY PROPOSITIONS Without the taxing power government can not exist ; yet with it governments destroy themselves . The destruction , tragically enough , usually is through social undertakings called democratic , but which actually violently transgress rights in private property . Ballots loaded with governmental benefits oblige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably lead to war . To expect any other result is to ignore human nature . The circumstances of war may oblige governments to exercise their sovereign prerogative to seize , without compensation , all property . Therefore as long as war is a possibility , the government , in theory , owns everything and the citizen nothing . Constitutions are protections and safeguards to prevent government from using wartime powers in peacetime . The major protections for private property are found in the constitutional principle of equal footing for the three branches of government ? not in the Bill of Rights . Instinctively , deny it as he will , the politician realizes that there is no greater threat to his power than for citizens to be independent of government for their food and shelter . The theory of sacredness of private property rests upon the ground that individuals who do not depend upon government for the necessities of life are free in their position to resist governmental tyranny or encroachments .  | Footnote  | " Make way for Liberty " he cried , " Make way for Liberty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Private Property The inherent rights and liberties protected by the Constitution may be divided as : Private Property Rights , Political Rights , and Civil Rights , including religion . In this chapter property rights will be discussed . Because so many people have the false impression that under the Constitution their title to property is absolutely safe , ' really their own , present limitations upon protection for property rights should be examined . It is particularly important to do so because of the current political philosophy ( revival of an ancient one ) that private property , especially ownership of the means of production , is the root of all evil , the barrier to economic security , and may , therefore , properly , be taxed out of existence . ' That philosophy is , more or less , supported in the United States by about ten million voters in a strategic position . It is a direct attack upon the idea that men should seek security through ownership of property . It wants him to seek security through political relations . The Fifth Amendment is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect property from it.2a But , not withstanding the Fifth Amendment , and outside of the dangerous philosophy referred to , there are still many  | ways by which government can seize private property without compensation and compel the subject to rely on political favoritism for his security . Some of these ways will be discussed in this chapter , starting with General Taxation . By General Taxation Taxation is the most ancient and most frequent method used to seize property . It is , generally , not classified as seizure procedure because it is presumed that the citizen wants to pay his taxes , surrender a portion of his property ( in the form of income ) for governmental protection . But because he has to pay his taxes , no matter how much he objects to what the government official is using his money for , taxation involves a sufficient element of compulsion to be classed , for the purpose of this discussion , as seizure of property . And it bears repeating that it is the easiest and most common method for taking private property ( money ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting public welfare . No definite or fixed restriction can be placed upon this power . Without unlimited taxing power , the right to take as much money ( property ) from the citizen as the officials believe necessary , a government can not function successfully . Yet , tragically enough , with this power , governments often defeat their major objective ? promotion of public welfare . ' It is generally brought about by adopting tax-supported under-Footnote  | takings such as land grants , tariffs , big " defense " programs , subsidies , pensions , protected utilities , or outright relief . ' In these present days the great danger to public welfare arises from the taxation which is necessary to support high wages , crop curtailments , and other means of reducing production , such as five-day weeks , low norms of production , unrestrained strike procedure , governmental monopolies , etc . Legislation to support such taxation can easily become the most vicious method by which to destroy property rights , including business and even professions . If it dries up business there is bound to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under these laws . ' And what a field for intimidation and graft ! It should not be overlooked that many of the big industrialists favor these kind of laws , as such laws have a tendency to eliminate competition . They are introduced , generally , on the ground that they will prevent overproduction and distribute properly the hours of gainful employment . Private Property Destroyed by Ballot Pressure on Taxation Policies Governments with the minimum qualifications for voters ( in which group the United States through disregard of the Constitution may now be classed ) are particularly susceptible to taxing programs which impair or destroy title in property , and , consequently , economic security . This is so because , when Footnote  | Footnote  | economic upheavals arise the destitute become the overwhelming majority of voters . Naturally , through the ballot , they control the taxing policies of the elected branches , and force spend and spend programs until the economic structure collapses . ' That pressure forced President Roosevelt to abandon his sober 1932 campaign promises . ' Any administration confronted with it will be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check the rush to bankruptcy or to more government control under such circumstances , because only legislators and presidential candidates who promise the most tax-born benefits can win.78 Obviously , in the United States , the voting Frankenstein , born in government benefits created by taxation , is out of control . The war was welcomed by many ( not openly of course ) as a means to stop the monster . But it has only strengthened him . Resort to novel bookkeeping , subterfuges , fictions or more war will be of no avail . The fact that we needed or still need NRA or OPA government is evidence of how threatening the situation is . Incidentally OPA like NRA was charged with a two-fold obligation ? prevent inflation and deflation ( an economic crisis ) ? quite an assignment if free enterprise and the present day out-of-bounds ballot are to be maintained at the same time . It is to be noted , and with apprehension , that although the country is at peace , more alphabetical agencies prevail today than during the Roosevelt war period . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war hazards . How could it be otherwise ? In connection with the taxing policy it is proper to call attention to the three primary factors for voting : ( a ) the voters must have equal or common knowledge of the issues ;  | Footnote  | ( b ) a common interest therein ; ( c ) and common responsibility . With any one of these factors missing the ballot is out of balance and futile if not vicious , ' so far as protection to private property or economic security is concerned . ( Balances or adjustments are made by property and educational requirements , and by the two-thirds or three-fourths majority rules . ) With the ballot out of balance , especially with respect to responsibility , which is the case when the disheartened and destitute voters make up the majority , property holders are without protection , notwithstanding Constitutions , Magna Cartas or Bills of Rights . The " liberal " politicians , liberal with promises which can not be kept and with the distribution of money and property that does not belong to them , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under such circumstances , and are , therefore , the first victims . ' After all the money has been spent the leaders , in order to save face , undertake to cover the taxpayer by applying economic pressure upon other countries or by declaring war on them . It is done , of course , always , in the name of humanity , liberty , self-defense , war to end wars , etc. , and with the consent of the majority of voters , no matter how ridiculous , dishonest or farfetched the justifying claims may be . That is the story of Russia under Lenin and Trotsky , Italy under Mussolini and Germany under Hitler . Each one of these leaders , like those before them , persuaded their followers to believe that they represented a democratic movement , liberalism . But their programs soon became , in spite of their best efforts , dictatorships , which obliged them to either tax their subjects into destitution ( take all their property ) or declare war upon a neighbor . It is obvious , therefore , that many  | Footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frightened voters to follow leaders who promise by the use of taxes to create a world without hardships . Private Property Destroyed By Favoritism There arise , of course , a great many unethical influences under the " liberal " forms of government which have a tendency to impair the property rights necessary to maintain economic security . " For instance , very conspicuous ones arise from the fact that those who " know " the " Commissar " have a tremendous advantage . This makes especially eloquent epigrams such as " What is the Constitution among friends , " and " Kissing goes by favor . " Bribing or other outright acts of corruption do not cause the real trouble . It is the plain every-day personal relationship based on good appearance and presentation that does this . " All the key men are in a position to distribute or allocate to themselves or their friends millions of dollars , dollars drafted from the tax payers ? their private property ? not the funds of the dispenser or distributor . The-RFC scandals , income tax scandals , war surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No honest man would dare to trust himself in such a position , at least not without bond for malfeasance . But these key-men are not bonded . That is so for the simple reason that it is practically impossible to prove fraud under such circumstances . Indeed , much of the distribution activities are labeled " confidential " or " top secret " so that it is impossible to check on them . Moreover , by means of propaganda through the radio , screen and press , the leaders can , and do , keep themselves in control by fictions about shortages and over-produc-Footnote  | Footnote  | tion . The means of propaganda under these " liberal " forms of government are so great that in a few weeks , as happened in Italy , Germany , and Russia , public sentiment can be created that will demand that government seize all property involving the means of production . The " free " press , screen and radio , naturally , as well as expediently , fall in line with the government 's policies , especially when it has charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , is " enthusiastic , " for the government is in a position to make or break him . For instance , a labor leader may declare a strike , and the President , a human being who depends on votes to keep his job , determines whether it shall continue ! That is tyranny , not democracy . An old-fashioned political campaign based on outcry against waste and corruption has little as a reform effort , because the voters are all partakers in the program . The trend in this direction is everywhere , and as in the United States , is covered under high sounding phrases such as " full employment , " " liberalism , " " socialism , " " social democracy , " etc . The most deceptive aspect is that the attacks on communism are directed at the leaders , not at the form of government which they represent ! Free Enterprise ( the kind provided for by the Forefathers ) was introduced to stop the corroding favoritism that developed because of governmental control under the guildes , syndicates , and mercantilism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favoritism to quite a degree , but it does not stimulate it , as the dispenser thereof has to use his own money , at least much more so than a government official who uses the money he collects from the taxpayers ? the poor people . Also the citizen who conducts his business ( private property ) under free  | Footnote  | enterprise principles does not act in the name of sovereignty as a government official does , and can not , no matter what the situation is , exercise the same extensive degree of coercive influence or authority . He can not levy taxes , impose prison terms , or , by governmental mandate execute his opponent in order to cover up misdeeds . The industrialist , of course , tries to dominate government in order to obtain favors and advantages . However , contrary to the teaching of the " humanitarians " or " liberals , " his opportunities to do so increase under the New Orders . He then , as a government official conducting business , comes dressed in sovereign authority . What chance is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And who , twenty years ago , would have believed that statesmen , lawyers and judges would call such a course constitutional ? A particularly disturbing aspect of this situation is that when a strong nation follows such a course , undertakes to run business , it becomes difficult for other nations to avoid adopting a similar course . Hence the taxing policies " of the people " with its attending unethical practices and favoritism may compel other nations to resort to war as a matter of self-defense ? protection of the private property of their citizens ; 13a or , may oblige them to take on the same kind of government , namely , preclude the citizens from owning property beyond a very nominal amount . Many of President Roosevelt 's wartime speeches show how true that is . Inventions have intensified this danger , for they have made heretofore distant nations next-door neighbors . Such a situation should have some significance for those prone to abandon constitutional government ( in the sense that the Forefathers used that phrase ) in order to relieve the destitute or to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title to private property is under the policies of " the people " as directed by the " liberals " ! 14 Threats to Private Property By Special Taxation As another illustration of attempts at seizure , without compensation , of property , the high taxes on incomes and estates may well serve . When a government needs so much money or is enthusiastic about collecting such large sums , it is a sure sign that something is wrong . However , there is a great deal of fiction about these taxes . If they were collected according to the public impression , it would not be possible to accumulate enough private capital to start any enterprise . Indeed , it would force government ownership to such an extent that money , in the correct sense of that word , would disappear as it did in Russia during her reign of terror . However , many authorities are apprehensive that the present debt burden , if confronted with a depression , will create enough relief-taxation pressure to force government ownership ( abolition of private property ) in spite of the safe-guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly the essence of totalitarianism or of the Russian form of government.15 That this uneasiness is deeply imbedded in the minds of persons in high position is evidenced by all the talk about four freedoms , full employment , cradleto-the-grave security , compulsory savings , compulsory military service , compulsory 5-day weeks , etc . The Four Freedoms , of course , have no value in the absence of security for title to property , and security of title to property can not exist where too much of the income has to be collected to pay for what is no longer in existence or has no utility . Unbalanced budgets may constitute a threat to private property to such an extent that public welfare , democracy , is very  | Footnote  | seriously jeopardized . As already suggested the present more than two hundred billion dollar debt partakes of that character . It will eventually be necessary to reduce the wage scale to meet the competition abroad . But if wages are reduced to that extent , the scale will be so low that not even the interest on the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty percent , the debt , relatively , is doubled , becomes $500,000,000-000.16 It is pertinent here to note that the high cost of production made a farce of the loans we made to Great Britain , ? indeed , of all our loans and gifts to the troubled nations . Adverse Influence of Private Wealth The political pressure for heavy taxes on estates and large incomes developed from the theory that individuals in possession of great wealth prevent enactment of legislation which aims at modifying the brutal policies involved in long hours , low pay , poor working conditions and age limitations . This theory , therefore , was introduced to impose restrictions on the accumulation of wealth , and thus destroy the influences which interfered with social legislation or the removal of hardships in connection with conducting or promoting business . However , heavy taxes eventually became necessary to support the unemployed and the aged . If the heavy taxes resulted , as many economists say , in armies of citizens becoming dependent upon government for food and shelter ( which eventually results in disaster for everybody ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of working killing hours with minimum pay for private industry . The long-hour worker knows at least that if he is producing something there may be a chance for him or some one near him to get " from under . " This raises the issue as to whose program is the most humane : Is it the program of the " brutal " industrialist who  | teaches that ownership of property rights is the basis of economic security ? Or , is it the program of the " kindhearted " " liberal " who teaches that ownership of private property is the root of all evil ? Russia 's experience is in point . Stalin , advertised sometime ago by our government as the essence of kindness , in fifteen years changed Russia from a half-starving country to one that began to dominate world markets . But Stalin built his commercial empire with a much greater degree of brutality than was ever used by the capitalists , " and , according to good authorities , with more disastrous results , and a great many less benefits . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are won ? with the blood , sweat and tears of the weak and innocent . The industrialist as a private individual , therefore , to be successful in developing commerce ( business ) must have the same unrestrained authority that government has to have to accomplish its objectives . What , therefore , can be more idle , or more deceptive than talk about the abundant life , as though it could be created without heart-rending hardships ? Even Stalin has not been guilty of practicing that vicious deception . He , of course , used other methods of cheating . War is a means of protecting commerce , public or private . It is to be anticipated , therefore , that promoting commerce calls for as many sacrifices in peace time as in times of war , no matter who is in charge , a government official or a captain of private enterprise . And it must be borne in mind that constitutional free enterprise ( the private property theory ) was chosen because government-controlled enterprise ( mercantilism Footnote  | or Roman diocletianism ) had a record of extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnation , notwithstanding its introduction as the road to democracy , humanitarianism and liberalism ? public welfare . No normal person delights in imposing hardships . It is probable that the industrialist was realistic instead of deceptive , for today the trends he tried to stem are sweeping in complete government control in every corner of the world . A big company corporation is generally used to show the " awful " results which develop from allowing private individuals too much control of property . Although it is hard to prove that the employment policies of a private corporation are detrimental to public welfare , the politicians have no difficulty in making people believe that it is true . But just as it is impossible to prove that the general who ordered a million men into battle did not serve his country properly by that act ? did not promote public welfare , so it is impossible to prove that a corporation which reduces the price of a commodity has not also served its country in spite of the numbers " slain . " It certainly has not been established that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in industry is always a menace to good government and therefore should be destroyed or at least curtailed to the extent that the " liberals " suggest . The reformers are too sure they are right . Their judgment is not entitled to much weight if they are the beneficiaries of the program they recommend . The " humanitarians " could have done it all much better , cheaper and quicker without concentrating wealth or demanding the maximum from employees , no doubt ! It does not appear that industry 's " crime " was that it created idle money , for the governmental wrath and punishment fell upon the industries which were creating jobs and producing  | Footnote  | wealth . The attacks were most severe at the time when it was not engaged in " influencing " government , so that influencing government improperly was not the crime in question . What the government intended to do with the money it forced out of legitimate production was lost sight of in the enthusiasm aroused by the slogan " soak the rich " , a subtle attack upon private property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogan really meant ? give the politician more power and have title to private property decided by the ballot instead of by the courts ; " that ultimately it would result in machinery which would destroy the last chance anyone had of being independent of government " dole " ; that it transferred power from a private citizen , one with many legal checks on his conduct , to a government official , a human being , without any such checks ? one representing sovereign power . Modern Methods for Destroying Private Property In recent years other methods by which government can seize , destroy or interfere with title to private property have been emphasized , such as one-sided anti-strike laws , " price controls , minimum hours and wage laws , production controls , hidden subsidies , or government acting as investor , landlord , philanthrophist ( giving tax-payer 's property ( money ) to foreign countries ) ; or as a parent , compelling children to save part of their wages , the parent exercising complete control or ownership over the part saved . No potentate ever had such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his subjects . ( The taxpayer indeed is a " trusting soul " to believe that human beings can be given that much power , without financial responsibility , and not abuse it ! ) The Forefathers never expected such a result from their Constitution ! Just how far is the United States from the condemned Euro-  | pean governments in that respect ? How much farther must we go before the " liberals " can no longer hide that they are following in the steps of Mussolini , Hitler , Lenin and Stalin ? What the " Liberals " Believe From what has been said , it appears that the " liberals " believe that the government can be given enough control of production and distribution to assure abundance and avoid over-production and distribution difficulties . Some of the supporters of this objective frankly admit that their programs involve abandonment of the conventional ideas of private property and money because so many of the workers will be on the same basis as a soldier ? necessities , food , clothes , transportation and shelter furnished on requisition . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained without abandonment of the principles of the American Constitution as they relate to free enterprise or private ownership of the means of production . But all of them are dissatisfied with the distance that the United States has already traveled in that direction , and are sure that it can go much farther without any danger of being obliged to go all the way , accept Stalin 's system . His system ( not communism ) is a form of government which objects to a citizen owning the means of production , and requires so much political supervision of daily affairs that the subject is a government ( political ) slave or pawn . The " liberals " do not state how far they want to go . But , like Stalin , they minimize the government slave labor phase by teaching that citizens should be just as willing to sacrifice their property and their lives for their country under a peace program as under a war program ; that , indeed , they should be more willing , since a peace program is constructive and certainly gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | These propositions seem plausible enough . No politician has difficulty in selling them , notwithstanding the fact that they involve abandonment of the doctrine of sacredness of private property that the Forefathers subscribed to . Of course , a new and more enlightened conception of private property is announced to take the place of the old doctrine . Such propositions are being brushed aside too lightly especially by the layman . No one can foresee what kind of government will develop upon the bursting of the bubbles blown on the pipes of spend-and-spend , governmental debt-has-no-significance , and labor 's right to strike must not be abridged . But how , step by step , the whole constitutional conception of government is being discarded , and the **26;1594;TOOLONG idea introduced to direct every phase of life ! We fail to recognize this as the Russian or European way because of prejudice , and because of the solemn and earnest declarations of the " Liberals " that they are leading us toward democracy , freedom from want and fear . But let us look at some of the obvious objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which accrues to one person under this kind of government , the power urge , instead of the profit urge , is bound to be so great that contentions for this power will result in blood purges terminating in civil war , stagnation and starvation . ( The political pressure which made a four-term president , in fact , a life-term one , is evidence enough of the uncontrollable power urge . ) The European blood purge and concentration camps are inevitable results . When that happens private property is destroyed for the great majority . Another difficulty is that if we use their " full employment " programs honestly , the machinery in the United States can , in many instances , produce enough for most of the world . As  | other countries also will want to produce , in order to be independent , it is obvious that much machinery will be idle . One should bear in mind that the 60-million job boast really is no more than 60 million half-time jobs ? in fact is 30 million jobs divided to give 60 million , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present a world problem and involve half-time employment for the industrious and intelligent along with the lazy and the morons.20 Equality with a real sting in it ! And what about the war hazards ? Collapse for government enterprise always comes as a surprise . Hence no steps are taken to prevent it until it is too late . The unexpected element arises because the leaders dare not disclose the true state of affairs . Indeed , on the contrary , they have to deny that there is danger . If they showed they were alarmed , immediate panic and confusion would seize the country . All they can do is to deny that the danger exists and pray God that things will turn out all right . They therefore use fictions or psychology such as a mother employs for frightened children , a general for a panicky army , bankers for disturbed depositors , doctors for delicate patients . The possibility of collapse of government enterprise is greater than for free enterprise because the government official is in a particularly good position to hide facts from inquiring minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public necessity or " military " secret , etc. , which the record indicates he does freely , frequently , unnecessarily , and often , if not generally , viciously . There is , therefore , no way to ascertain when a collapse is imminent . The first rule of Democracy with Footnote  | respect to protection for public welfare and private property is therefore ignored when a government gets into a position where it has to beguile citizens with propaganda ( fictions ) for fear that if they had the facts their judgment would defeat government plans . Such a situation creates a relationship between the citizens and the government which destroys the protection for private property that was contemplated by the Constitution . How can one escape from realizing that these practices , starting under the guise of taxation , government investment , compulsory savings and full employment , lead to the type of government Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin represent or represented ? 21 War Powers and Private Property One of the grave objections to the theory of the " Liberals " is that it gives the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the " Liberal " denies this , it is necessary to set the matter out in detail for clarification purposes . In war , a government may find itself in a position where it must command the last dollar ? ignore every restraint on seizure of property . As long , therefore , as nations can declare war the citizens , in theory , owns nothing , and the government owns everything , and consequently the government has no restraint on its conduct either as to taxation or direct seizure Footnote  | Footnote  | of property , regardless of Constitutions or Bills of Rights.22 Such instruments were never intended to obliterate the power described in such phrases as " divine right of government , " " the king can do no wrong , " " my country right or wrong . " That power of course is to be used only when circumstances compel the government to follow such a course . Nevertheless , when necessary , government has to be in a position to take life and property without any obligation for compensation . The eminent domain proposition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . However , it is a very valuable check on the officials who exercise the " King-can-do-no-wrong " prerogatives of sovereign power . The king-can-do-no-wrong phrases are ways of saying that an individual is supposed to assume his government represents an informed majority and is therefore right even if its demands are to the extent of terminating life and seizing property . These phrases are unfortunate and misleading ways for describing majority rule , or the simple idea that one person with a minimum of information should not pit his judgment against the opinion of a whole nation or the opinion of a majority of the experts . These extreme statements of governmental power no doubt grew out of the necessity to refute the equally extreme theory that a person was obliged to follow his conscience ( God ) no matter what other persons believe , a theory which embraced the idea of an unlimited right in property for the individual ? in delicate words ? the dignity ' of man , rugged individualism to the last degree . The limitations which the ' Constitution imposed upon government were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do no wrong , a theory which cer-  | tainly jeopardizes the citizen 's title to his private property . The Constitution tried to correct the unsound conceptions about the authority of the king ( government ) and the title to property vested in an individual . However , the theory that the government can do no wrong , the old divine right of kings theory , is being rapidly restored to its original paralyzing position under the glamour of governmental controls , benefits and ownership . It is that theory which the " liberals " have in mind when they say they are fighting a war to abolish poverty and social inequality . They are , asking for war powers in times of peace ! The Constitution tried to make it impossible for government officials to exercise wartime powers during peacetime , because that would subject title io private property constantly to wartime jeopardy , that is , practically leave it without protection and eventually , if past experience means anything , would result in permanent destitution for many and special privilege for the few ? only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not waged to such an aggravated extent that government is justified in seizing life and property without responsibility for compensation . The citizen , therefore , generally enjoys his property as though he owned full title . However , when government undertakes to banish poverty under the same unlimited power which it uses to conduct war , it will always be exercising the maximum of authority over property . Such a situation , of course , creates permanent insecurity for private property . The paralyzing effect of that relationship between the government and the citizen is the primary reason why these so-called democracies make for misery and stagnation . Property ownership , because it creates security dependent  | upon the owner 's judgment and integrity is , of course , one of the main driving impulses of civilization and therefore should be entitled to governmental protection . It was the serious consequences which followed inadequate protection for title to property that gave birth to the numerous world-renowned charters , petitions and constitutions , including the Constitution of the United States . Apparently the sublime faith in these documents is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misguided , frightened , or greedy majorities , generally reduce them to useless scraps of paper . Major Protection for Private Property Under the Constitution The major protection afforded by the Constitution against the devices for seizing property , or reducing its title value , are the ancient principles therein providing for the specific jurisdiction of the different branches or divisions of government , including local sovereignty , such as city , county and state control . Imagine the effect upon rights in property if the legislators or the President acted as judges , especially during an economic upheaval when a majority of the voters are made up of the destitute , the ignorant , the misinformed , and the discouraged , disappointed , sick , desperate and helpless . Such voters , no matter how intelligent or how honest , could hardly be expected to vote against spending money in their own behalf , regardless of its origin or the manner of collection . As an example , in the Detroit sit-down strike , a Constitution , a governor , and appointed judges were almost helpless in the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That strike demonstrates the present weakness in title to property . The elected officials , because of the ballot pressure , were not far  | Footnote  | from conceding that private ownership of an industrial plant was a wicked fallacy and should be abandoned.23 Just imagine the result if the judges who are appointed for life made the laws , or the ballot 's scope was enlarged under referendums , initiatives and recalls so that the voters themselves were required to settle the complex issues of government which have confused and confounded judges , statesmen , economists and presidents ? individuals supposed to have special preparation for that kind of work . It is obvious , therefore , that it is the democratic principle of separate powers which protects the inherent rights to property ? and , after all , very ancient and honored aspects of government . Nevertheless , politicians sincere or otherwise , have been particularly busy fooling the voters into believing that these principles should be discarded , 24 and have already forced government a long distance in that direction.25 One subtle way they have of fooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these new forms of government because of the Bill of Rights . That Bill , however , is futile and worthless under their systems of government because they defeat the principles involved in free speech , free elections , short terms of office , independent courts and legislators and local government ( state government ) . These principles of course are significant because they protect the theory of the sacredness of private property , the free enterprise system , without which social security can not be maintained . There is much lip-service about independence of courts , 26 the limitations on the executive and the legislators , and the free ballot . However , the numerous and constant curtailments of the rights in private property through enhanced and glamorous authority exercised over them by government officials under Footnote  | cradle-to-the-grave and full-employment programs , should be a clear and definite signal to anyone that all is not well . The check on the ballot provided by the Constitution is of particular importance in the protection of property rights . An unwary person listening to the average politician talking about Democracy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave voted , and that they voted on every question . However , generally , one has to be 21 before he can vote and , besides , in many instances , he has to own property as well as have a certain amount of education , and even then he can only vote , not on governmental policies or particular laws , but merely for certain individuals to represent him , and who are supposed to use their judgment , not the voter 's , with respect to governmental policies . The Constitution does not say anything directly about age limitations , property and educational qualification of voters , but it was ordained under the assumption that the limitations then in effect would continue . There would have been an altogether different constitution had the creators thereof been confronted with the ballot as it is used today . The change in ballot restrictions makes it impossible to honor many of the fundamental principles in the Constitution . As things stand today , the limitations on the ballot have been removed to such an extent that our present form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not entitled to being classed as a democracy , if one means by that term protection of title to private property as contemplated by the Forefathers . The careless as well as adroit use by prominent people of the word " democracy " has made it mean benevolent dictatorship , a form of government which can not recognize the constitutional principle of equal footing for the three main  | branches of government . That is so because that principle imposes too many restraints on the seizure of property necessary to maintain such forms of government . It is probable that these countries described as democracies , which included Japan before the war , have the government which affords them the best chance to live , to promote commerce and business ; but their governments in no sense of the word can be called democracies , unless one wishes to use the word to describe any type of government which appeals to him . Laissez Faire for Business as Property The main principles of government in the Constitution , especially the idea of equal footing for the three usually mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that the Forefathers believed that social security , progress , democracy , strength in government , justice , mercy , humanitarianism , a chance to make a decent living , freedom and liberty , independence from systems of other countries , depended upon what is called the theory of unqualified title to property . This theory is now generally referred to by such words and phrases as free enterprise , capitalism , 27 no limit to the amount of property one person may accumulate by lawful means , merit is entitled to its reward ? the laissez faire theory . Footnote  | It should be observed that today this theory is only applied to the fields of medicine , science , literature , entertainment and religion . The " liberals " recognize the laissez faire doctrine for the arts , for entertainment and for government . The forefathers , however , aimed at a liberal application of the laissez faire doctrine to business ? laissez faire for business , but not for government because it was not responsible , in the usual sense of the word , for its conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unqualified title to property , that is , private citizens owning the means of production . They are the same principles which prevail when an artist is allowed his recognition without interference by the government , a general his glory , an inventor his credit , a poet his fame , a statesmen his honor ? all without limitation as to amount regardless of the heart-break for others who try to follow , and all without interference , restriction or curbing by government on the ground that the fame or the glory will give the owner too much power . No one , so far , has suggested a law that they should be limited in their quest for achievement . However , the enthusiasm for " floors " and " ceilings " , cradle-to-the-grave aid , and full-employment schemes demonstrates that there is now a world-wide spirit to have government determine , not only how much property one may acquire , but also what vocation a citizen should follow , where he should live , what he must do , how long he should work , and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord with that of the Constitution , and certainly striking at the very heart of security through ownership of property , and opening the flood-gates of governmental corruption and permanent distress for the greatest number of people . Of course , under an economic structure based on the con-  | stitutional theory of courts and legislators , that is , unqualified title to property , capitalism , free enterprise , rugged individualism , or whatever it should be called , boys and girls , and men and women , because of low income and for many other reasons , have not a chance in the world of reaching their objectives ; but they have a much better chance to do that under such a structure than they have under the schemes of government control proposed in the United States and in the rest of the world in the name of liberalism ; but , unfortunately , not enough of such opportunity to avoid dangerous social unrest because of the rank injustice which prevails . However , there is one important advantage under free enterprise . The wronged person ( and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redress for a grievance from individuals and employers who are subject to law and court restraint , whereas under the " New Orders " his contentions are with his government , a supreme power which may disregard his grievance with impunity and often affords him no redress except by civil war.28 This remedy , generally , is so clearly futile that the government official does not hesitate to do as did the oppressors referred to in the Bible , increase the load whenever a subject complains . Therefore there will be no complaints , and in the absence thereof the government official will boast of unity , liberty and prosperity until civil war overtakes him . Such a situation can not develop if the ancient principles with respect to independent branches of government and short term of office are properly adhered to . The economists or politicians who complain that under capitalism or free enterprise a few people own all the property , or enough to contrul government , should know that such a situation is evidence that the Consti-Footnote  | Footnote  | tution has been ignored . They should also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it concentrates wealth and political power absolutely in one place ? the head of government , and , therefore , is bound to increase oppression and corruption ten-fold.29 This is so because it gives a human being too much power without the proper checks , and , therefore always results in abuse . That is the major basis of every limitation on human conduct , and is the premise for the limitations which the Constitution imposes upon judges , congressmen , presidents and voters in order to protect private property ( interests ) , the protection of which appears to be the surest road to general economic security.30 The limitations , of course , can be maintained only by keeping intact the principle of separated powers . Hence no provision was made for " . humanitarians " who believe they can be trusted with these powers combined ! Indeed , governmental restrictions are aimed particularly at that group , for their godcomplex makes them imagine they can not do , or be , wrong and stimulates their ego toward purges and schemes for seizing property in the name of public welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition that they , like all human beings , should not be trusted with sovereign power , except in the narrow field or area provided by the Constitution . They knew they were not holy men . In spite of loud denial , the political " humanitarians " and " liberals " realize instinctively that there are no greater threats to personal political power than divided governmental authority and citizens who own enough property or have sufficient income to be independent of political favor.31 From that fact arises their enthusiasm for concentrated governmental authority ? an attitude which they are bound to believe , because of  | Footnote  | self-interest , is humanitarian , no matter how silly . Their disposition to believe that others have improper motives , should put them on guard as to the natural trend of the human mind , including their own . Restraints on Builders of Commercial Empires Recognition must be made of the value , weight and significance of the complaint that when a citizen has extensive property holdings , he exercises too much control over the machinery of government , and consequently too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is a remedy it is not more government regulations or ownership of a character which will result in having both wealth and political power concentrated in one place . Because of the tragic results which would follow such a course it is a primary objective of democratic government to keep these two powers separated as much as possible . The argument must be whether the principle of divided powers as expressed in the Constitution is the most effective way . This raises the old and hereto unanswered question of the checks which should be imposed on the authority of human beings in the administration of the affairs of state . The scope of that authority must vary according to circumstances . Congested areas certainly impose restraints which would not be tolerated in rural communities . However , congested social structures do not give rise to circumstances which compel or require nullification of the principle involved in divided political authority , namely , courts and parliaments as recognized by the Constitution . That principle carries with it short term of office , a free ballot for electing representatives , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the employer to hire and fire in peace time or any other time to the same degree that government requires that power in wartime . " a  | Footnote  | It is believed that it would not be disputed that the Forefathers were convinced that abandonment of that kind of government would soon destroy equal opportunity , or such protection for private property rights or interests in them as is necessary to make a highly civilized community possible . They apparently also accepted as truth that the soundest method to keep misery and want at low ebb , and the abundant life at high tide , was to emphasize the individual 's right to property , ? to be liberal in that respect . The tendency today is to be liberal in the opposite way ? liberal with governmental power to dispense with private property . One can hardly understand how any judge can count himself in harmony with the Constitution , a true liberal , when he subscribes to that doctrine . The Forefathers apparently believed that the right to acquire wealth to any extent , did most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing cheaper , faster and better than any other country.32 That is the objective one has to adopt in wartime , and after all building a commercial empire may be a more bitter and exacting struggle than conducting a war . The maximum of effort , without the hot blood of war to deaden the pain , is the price a citizen must pay to be free from the necessity of government relief in the form of dole , unemployment compensation , pensions , minimum wages , etc . He , generally , balks at that price because he does not realize that such relief is particularly cruel and undesirable because it eventually imposes permanent distress upon the masses , although at first it seems to spell out security . The maximum of properly directed effort is the only rule which can be followed if a nation wishes to be prosperous and free , and independent of the economic structures of other countries . The right to build commercial empires without the assistance of governmental subsidies and in the face of unrestricted competition at  | Footnote  | home and abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not choked off , was the economic atmosphere in which the Constitution was born . The modern economist , however , is busy discarding that philosophy . He has reversed it to such an extent that . he is confronted with frozen patent rights , frozen wage scales , frozen prices and frozen hours of work , with the result that business in general , also , is frozen . He is trying to create a thaw with money of the taxpayer , not realizing that the smoke he sees indicates intense cold , not heat , and that therefore he is only freezing things tighter . Whether he wants to or not , his program will compel him to do more and more freezing . Eventually , social unrest will drive him to establishing a large military force to beat his own subjects into obedience . Before long he will be facing , to keep from perishing , the same warmaking necessity which confronts the communist ? force the nations of the world to accept his form of government by comintern or by war . Too late he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( private property ) , has intensified the hardships he intended to modify . It seems one can not escape the uncompromising and unrelenting fact that business ( commerce , private property interests ) , in order to be successful enough to create security , needs the same unrestrained authority in its field that government requires in time of war . The communist indicates his recognition of that fact by his frantic effort to put everything on a war basis . The sweet phrases , full-employment , war to end poverty , security **28;1622;TOOLONG , and government promised food , clothes and shelter , involve the same proposition . War , however , is the primitive method of protecting business , and war methods in times of peace , like competition , are cruel , costly and often futile.33  | Footnote  | That this matter is tangled and confused in the minds of many seems obvious from the fact that those who complain about cruel and ruthless business methods are the first to shout for war , or to imagine that war is necessary , and apparently they glory in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all in the name of business ? commerce ; and those who are afraid of war or pretend to tremble at it , do not hesitate to play the whip on the bare back in the name of business . Both of them demand the pound of flesh nearest the heart , and both are satisfied that they are humanitarians , and neither one realizes that he is subscribing to the doctrine of private property , rugged individualism , and ( paradoxically enough ) recommending the maximum of regimentation . The Swing Toward Communism ? Russian Dictatorship Our Forefathers may have been too drastic and too narrow in their premises about competition and private property . However , the tendency is to completely reverse their position . The reverse of it is communism , from which Russia under Stalin partly backed away , although , of course , under a declaration that communism was being developed . Fortunately for Stalin , the word " communism " was worshipped in Russia without the worshipers calling for a definitions ' According to not a few , by an adroit use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the kind of government Russia had or has . The similarity may not be obvious to some because the United States government aimed , in the first instance , at control of food supplies ( property ) by reducing output , " while Russia , in order to get control was obliged to aim at increased output because her subjects were starving . However , scarcity makes it much easier to justify government control . Governments have learned to use scarcity as the basis for government control , scarcity by way of fictions .  | Footnote  | The fictions may give the " planners " their first real chance for permanent government control . The arguments in the fight for retention of OPA justify that conclusion . They all boil down to instigating hate , fear and suspicion of the " vicious " groups who are seeking profit . There will never be anything but scarcity if the " planners " have their way.38 Secretary Wallace found his precedent for governmental curtailment of food in the practice of the Captains of Industry , as though one evil justified another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alleged sympathy for the preservation of free enterprise , capitalism , the theory of private property ! The whole procedure suggests deception and fraud . The " planners " know that destruction of food is not the way of abundance.37 The alleged purpose back of the destruction of pigs was to increase prices , admittedly an unusual way to create abundance . But it paved the way for government control by introducing scarcity . Natural scarcity was not available as it was and is in Russia and generally is during wartime . As the art of scarcity has been mastered , the dream of the " planners " should become a reality.38 Anyhow could one conceive of a better way to remain in power ? It is not being suggested that responsible government officials deliberately plan permanent government control , even of food . But the leaders of such programs are the beneficiaries of power , prestige and office . Could they , under such circumstances , be expected to form an unbiased opinion with respect to the necessity for continuation of the program ? Is not that phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered , too , that many industrialists realize Footnote  | that the OPA principle of government is useful in promoting shortages . So long as there are shortages , there is no danger of the depressions which arise from what is termed over-production . They prefer OPA scarcity to over-production . It will be remembered that NRA sent people to jail for not charging enough , whereas OPA sent people to jail for charging too much . However " overproduction " is the plague of free enterprise . It is the Frankenstein that terrifies the business man into accepting NRA , AAA , NLRA , or OPA government . But if these programs are going to be really successful , something more than political footballs , it will be necessary to accept the principles of totalitarianism as practiced in Russia . " The present subsidies and privileges are enough to compel the adoption of that course . Can anyone stop this flight of the Magic Carpet ? But , under such circumstances , the heart of democracy stops beating because it becomes impossible to keep judges , legislators and executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free elections , free legislators , free religion and free education disappear . They dissolve automatically because of the corruption in government . And with them , of course , goes protection to private property and security . Free Speech and Private Property It has always been recognized that free speech ( criticism of government ) , because it involves directly or indirectly all the other freedoms , is the principal fortification for protecting title to private property and promoting general public welfare . But it can not function when the subjects are directly dependent upon their government for food and other essentials of daily life . That creates a relationship which discourages too much , Footnote  | if not altogether , the right kind of criticism . The fact that government represents sovereignty is enough to destroy all ground for assuming that the relationship of a government official to private property is one that entitles him to much authority . It is sovereign authority which develops the greatest fear of all ? the fear of the wrath of government . Therefore , when government has control of the necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects arises which precludes any basis for assuming that the subjects , at least the smart ones , will indulge in criticism that will be helpful to public welfare . Tribute must be paid to the judges and statesmen who emphasize the fact that free speech is destroyed when citizens become dependent upon government for their food and shelter For an individual , naturally , does not criticize , a benefactor , and is ready to destroy , generally , anyone who does , regardless of fair play or justice . The German atrocities are good examples . Private property protection under such circumstances simply can not exist , neither can progress continue nor social security flourish . The theory that private property is sacred rests upon the ground that only an individual who does not have to depend directly upon government for his food and shelter is free and therefore in a position to place proper checks upon political power . Such checks , of course , annoy the politician and is adequate basis for motive on his part to keep citizens in want and dependent upon government . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for the potter 's cunning hand !  | KEY PROPOSITIONS Under " Social Democracy " a government official is the employer , an employer who commands the Army and the Navy and may disregard courts and legislators . As he will be made of the same kind of clay that the captain of industry is made of , it should not be difficult to anticipate the abuse in store for the employee who gets out of favor . The new-order idea of government developed from a presumption that human beings will be satisfied if all have the same amount ? let it be enough . The truth is their pleasure comes from having more than others in wages , power , property , fame or glory . Any other spirit would result in stagnation . Governments are prone to have too many beneficiaries ; generally so many that criticism is very dangerous as well as futile . That is why free speech ( criticism of government ) is so strongly fortified in the Constitution . Free speech requires that the citizen maintain a relationship toward his government which will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is impossible when too many of the citizens are governmental beneficiaries or hopeless or hopeful dependents in the form of clerks , creditors , debtors , contractors or pensioners . It is in the first instance surrendered by consent ; after that because of fear ; by consent due to benefits ; by fear because of dependence on government for the necessities of life .  | Political Rights Political rights and property rights are closely tied together . Indeed , if one is not able to acquire enough property to be independent of government dole , work , food or shelter , political rights become worthless . ' Such rights as voting , holding office , and having courts and parliaments , are therefore insisted upon by the citizen because he has to have them to protect himself against governmental tyranny ( generally burdensome taxes for alleged welfare purposes ) with respect to property , jobs , business or profession ? matters which represent his life , home and children . Basis of Paralyzing Fear of Government Apparently , he does not realize how much he impairs or jeopardizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does quite generally today , the authority to direct how long he may work , what his wages shall be , the price he shall pay for commodities and what crops he shall raise . Although it has never been done before , he , nevertheless , seems to feel that such assignments can now be made without creating a situation which requires government officials to tell him the kind of work he shall perform , where he shall live , what he may have , or what profession or business he must follow , or in what Footnote  | concentration camp he must suffer ? the Russian style . ' However , that he is greatly mistaken about the matter should be readily appreciated because a government official represents sovereignty ? a power under which that official may disregard promises with impunity and can cover misdeeds and bungling under false public-necessity claims or military-secret bunk . And as he is a human being , no one has a right to expect that he will not abuse such power . It is hard to understand why the citizen does not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to protect himself against government-decreed destitution ; that under such circumstances the political rights such as free speech , courts , and parliaments , as well as the ballot , are impaired to such an extent that they are readily reduced to futile gestures , eliminated or turned against him as instruments of oppression . This is so because he is giving to one individual or one branch of government such tremendous power that it naturally frightens away criticism , invites blind obedience , and demands unmerited praise to such an extent that all protection for individual economic independence ( security ) is swept away . Germany , Italy and Russia are present-day examples . The political rights of the citizen , therefore , represent the restrictions which he must impose upon persons acting as government officials . They carry the implication . that one generally should not place too much of the affairs of his life in the hands of another , especially if that other is a government official ? a human being exercising unlimited power ? sovereignty . Footnote  | As we have already seen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a public official is not under a profit urge , or is a humanitarian and , therefore , will not abuse power ; or , that a way has been found ( by use of the ballot ) to drive unlimited political power in the right direction in spite of the frailty or viciousness of human nature ; or , the most foolish of all , that human nature has changed . The white race instinctively recognizes the danger in these theories . Its fear or hostile attitude toward governmental authority is pointedly expressed in Patrick Henry 's cry of " Give me liberty , or give me death . " A human being exercising governmental authority is in a particularly strategic position to mete out death in the name of humanity to anyone interfering with his " highly important programs " . And he will do so whether his name be Hitler , Roosevelt , Stalin , Wallace , Lenin , Willkie , Dewey or Truman . It , therefore , is not fantastic , but truly reasonable , to state that these types of so-called democracy which force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials ( human beings representing sovereignty ) , will force us to another Declaration of Independence because of the crucifixion of the Four Freedoms and the introduction of government " slavery " ? government telling subjects how much they shall earn , how long they shall work , for whom they shall work , what they shall wear , and what their political faith shall be . Government " slavery " is distinguished from other forms of " slavery " in that the Master ( a government official ) is dressed in the robes of sovereignty . The master and his henchmen , of course , will be fanatically enthusiastic about the matter . No Basis for Confidence in the " New Type Democracies " The demands for the so-called democracies arise because capitalism ( rugged individualism , free enterprise , constitutional  | government ) so often is unable to prevent near starvation and other hardships . As already suggested , the unbounded confidence in them springs from the idea that a government official is in a better position than a private individual to remedy the obvious evils . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to eliminate the hardships which overtake citizens in building a civilization ( a commercial empire ) is to increase the authority of the government officials over the means of production , and to decrease the power of the private citizen in that field . That , of course , is the Russian idea or philosophy of government . The " Liberal " claims , of course , that he does not want to go as far as the Russians have gone . However , he started with statements that he intended to go only a little farther than the Constitution provides . But now he feels that the Constitution is horse and buggy stuff . Apparently , he does not understand himself because he considers that all his opponents are " blackguards . " The increased governmental authority is represented as an enlargement of political rights by which the " down-trodden " will have a better chance to live decently . But the reverse must be true , for the citizen has to surrender his right of economic independence ( ownership of property ) in proportion that he enlarges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( an alleged enlargement of political rights ) which involves increasing governmental authority , the better qualified individual loses to a great extent personal contact with his employer . He surrenders that right of contact to a leader who is supposed to represent all employees , including the least qualified . That arrangement enhances the opportunity of the latter , but reduces the chances of the efficient worker to receive what he is entitled to . Such " equalization " procedure , of course , eventually destroys the  | economic security of all , for it penalizes efficiency and merit too much . Moreover , the individual , no matter how much he needs a few extra pennies , surrenders to the judgment of another , his right to determine when he shall work overtime , accept extra wages , or buy in free markets . For an imaginary political right the worker may have surrendered the only rights ( protection ) he needs to make his political rights worthwhile . The farmer under " collective " farming is obliged to use the judgment of experts who represent a political regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he soon finds himself confronted with more speculations and uncertainties than he would have met with had he used his own judgment . That result is inevitable because he has made it too easy for a government official , in the name of public welfare , to " collect " his crops . ' At present he is enjoying subsidy benefits . But his subsidies will eventually force Russian collectivism because the taxpayer can not carry the load.38 Collective bargaining and " collective " farming programs are , of course , the direct and necessary results which develop from control of prices , wages , hours of work and subsidies . And one must be simple or " grinding an ax " if he does not realize how difficult it will be to keep such procedure from stampeding his leader into complete government control . Moreover , the leader is a human being who will receive un- Footnote  | limited , or , at least , more power . Would not good judgment suggest that he will be tempted to make the disturbance that will start the stampede ? The Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their constitution the Russian was told that he would be allowed just enough property to exist , ' and no title ( in the usual sense of the word ) to business , farms , or other real estate . He was induced or compelled to exchange his right to hold property ? to be economically independent ? for a political power or function which promised to make him economically secure . But it reduced him to government-decreed destitution , and sent him to a concentration camp if he failed to be enthusiastic about the distress his government imposed upon him . The benefits he gained were swept away in the reign of terror which soon followed . ' Stalin 's subsequent dictatorship restored a semblance of order by its recognition of a few of the old fundamental principles of government set forth in the United States Constitution . ' But it is obvious than an enlargement of political rights or a more democratic structure did not result from these efforts . They brought the exact opposite , for democracy is a political structure with the maximum of individual rights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . And it is generally understood that such a structure can be maintained only by keeping the three main branches of government on equal f oozing , by insisting . on short terms of office and a properly restricted ballot , and , of course , by upholding Footnote  | the doctrine that majority rule means that elected experts shall use their own judgment in making the laws , and independent judges ( expet s ) shall do the same in interpreting them ; after all , the major principles of the Constitution ? in economic terms , free enterprise , open competition , rugged individualism , no arbitrary limits to the amount of private property a citizen may have , or who he shall hire or fire in the conduct of business ; payment according to value of work performed and not according to needs ? the merit rule . The merit rule as here suggested is a hard rule . Nevertheless its enforcement , as everybody knows , is the very essence of democracy , if by that word one means the maximum of security for the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that rule , it is the objective of all governments to protect and enforce it . The communists tried to repeal it by decreeing that persons should be paid according to their needs . The " liberals " call it the law of the jungle . Much of their legislation for the last two decades is colored with this anti-merit philosophy . Justices Stone , Cardoza and Brandeis , unintentionally , or unwittingly , perhaps , followed that lead to a great extent in their reasoning in the Tipaldo case , 298 U.S. 587.7 However , they used the merit rule , without any modification , to attain their honorable positions , we hope . Cruel as this rule may seem to be , it is the only one which stimulates production enough so that civilization can be maintained , and , consequently , offers the maximum of political rights which bear fruit . It is the only rule under which public welfare can be protected , although it does not sound as sweet as the rule sponsored by communism , that one shall receive what he needs regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the administrator thereof may be trying to do , Footnote  | Footnote  | hamstrings the strong and results in a situation where no one can get what he needs , including the political rights necessary to protect himself against corruption and tyranny as well as governmental decreed poverty . The merit rule is often in a position where it can have no mercy for the deficient . Moreover , under it government assumes no obligation to the effect that no one shall starve or fail to get what he needs , an obligation which the Communists , the Stalinists and " Liberals " want to charge to government ? the taxpayers . But , obviously so long as wars are waged , no government set-up can fulfill a promise of that character ; least of all the economic structures based on the political philosophy that a government official is best qualified to decide what one must pay his employees , what his profit shall be , how much property he may have , or where one shall work , how and when , or that the government must own and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is often called " Liberalism " .8 Such a course involves dictatorship , the reverse of democracy , and is bound to stimulate war , and war breeds abject poverty ? not economic security . And what could do more to stimulate a war spirit than a government spending taxpayers ' money abroad to interfere with the political programs of another country ? The disputes between John Lewis and the government may be used to further illustrate aspects of the " merit " rule as it touches production and hardships . If the government is going to run the mines effectively , make them produce coal the quickest , the cheapest and the best way possible , it can not accept the checks that Lewis , in order to keep his job , must impose to protect the inefficient , inadequate or unnecessary workers . If Lewis is going to run the mines effectively , he requires the same arbitrary power the government needs ; that is , the right  | Footnote  | to hire and fire and determine wages and hours according to the circumstances . That responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to use to continue as a dominating leader . ' Whoever takes the responsibility for doing the work , whether it be the government , the Union or a private owner , will have to be equally " brutal " in the execution thereof if it has to be done under an emergency or at high speed . The government official , however , as he represents sovereign power , is in the best position to be " brutal " or arbitrary ! He can really get things done because he can mete out death for infraction of rules ! It is that terrorizing fact which causes charters and constitutions to spring up in an effort to curtail government power , particularly as it relates to control and ownership of property and the means of production . What other reason could there be for placing limitations upon government ? The extensive governmental authority advocated by the " liberals " or social democrats , in spite of that simple truth , suggest that they are blinded by personal ambition and ready to use fiction , or anything else , to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in reality is their welfare , their advantage or security . The three-headed way of conducting business ? a government official , a labor leader and an employer ( the employer , the one who has to pay , being almost a silent partner ) eventually leads to making the basis of compensation " need " instead of merit . The " need " proposition developed from an assumption that human beings enjoyed work , would do the menial labor voluntarily , would be satisfied if they all had the same amount ? let it be enough . But the truth is that human beings derive their major pleasure from having more than someone else in wages , power , property , fame or glory . The excess repre-  | sents their security , especially from doing menial labor , or being in subjection to the arbitrary will of others . However , any other spirit or attitude would result in stagnation . But that spirit , must die , especially so far as production is concerned , when government , sovereign power , takes charge of wages , hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally recommended by the " liberals . " That brings the discussion back to the political philosophy of constitutional government ? that government as sovereign power can not be made financially responsible for its conduct ( " can not do wrong " ) and , therefore , must be restricted in its functions to fields where financial responsibility for conduct is not the issue . With just those elementary principles in mind , it should be obvious that the " social " democracies do not lead to economic security or political freedom , liberty , prosperity or happiness . It will clarify the issue if it is kept in mind that it is the obligation or duty of industrialists to produce as cheaply and quickly as possible and that the burden of that objective falls upon the worker , and that it is the duty and objective of labor to protect itself against long hours and poor pay . These two interests clash and are often at variance with public Welfare ? what is best for all . It is the function of government to stand between those two clashing interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not interfered with improperly.l ? a Forced Changes in Political Rights In the Federal Government political rights generally do not extend beyond voting for representatives in national affairs , and being elected or appointed to office . However , cities , counties Footnote  | and states provide many local political rights . To preserve these , the Federal Courts , Congress and the Executive had their power limited to certain fields . The full faith and credit provisions , the requirement that the geographical territory of a state should not be changed without its consent , the limitations on the Federal Courts , on Congress , and the guaranty to each state of a republican form of government , show the attention given to local political rights.11 The Forefathers were keenly alive to the necessity of having local matters taken care of by local authority , a principle which everybody subscribes to . The difficulty arises in the application thereof . Changes forced by commercial developments make it difficult to determine when a local matter has become an issue of national concern . For instance , improvements in transportation forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to national , and even to international jurisdiction . Federal legislation , therefore , developed in many fields , in spite of efforts to keep control in the States . This legislation compelled new political arrangements with respect to jurisdiction of courts , legislators and executives . Transportation improvements have forced so many changes in jurisdiction that the Supreme Court decisions relating to commerce look like high-water marks of confusion and contradiction , even to the members of the bench , the legislators , and presidents.12 From that situation sprang the strange , if not fantastic , doctrine about sit-down strikes which the Supreme Court could partly adjust because of the switch in public sentiment after the Detroit automobile " war " which perplexed Governor Mur-Footnote  | Footnote  | phy . But the controversy , of course , left unanswered the question of how far government can assume responsibility to its citizens for food , clothes and jobs without destroying local administration and causing government to collapse because of political corruption . Perhaps unemployment and governmental debt increased because the leaders were sure they could cure all evils by giving government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can fix anything " " which prevailed during the Roosevelt administration , and still manifests itself in the " liberals " may be a necessary practice of psychology to give assurance that everything will be all right . If these attitudes are not born in the high tension of conceit , or the full measure of ignorance , or are not a part of planning for changing the form of government so that the political leaders could enjoy more power , they may represent an effort to stop a stampede for governmental favors . But are these political philosophers concerned with the normal changes in local law , the changes in jurisidiction from state to federal because of developments in commerce ? Their demands that government assume permanently direct responsibility in so many instances to the individual for his job , food and shelter , causes many persons to believe that they are hoping that the economic confusion which generally follows war will give them their great chance . It is silly to assume that Wallace , and those backing him , did not know that the killing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opponents complained about . The objective of the scarcity programs was to obtain and establish political control of the food supply . They expected that such control would eventually create abundance . They believed it had been  | Footnote  | successful in Russia . As the United States had many advantages over Russia , they hoped for much better results in the United States , with a great deal less of agony.14 The policies of the OPA , and kindred bureaus , were based upon the same reasoning . Therefore , many of the shortages were deliberately made , and were often just plain fictions.15 There is no other way by which government can keep up controls . Is it any wonder that " planning " never creates abundance ? 158 Have we a right in good judgment to expect any other result from human beings , even though they believe they are humanitarians ? Tendency in New-Type Democracies to Destroy Important Political Rights As has often been pointed out , but apparently , futilely , the government control recommended by the " liberals " are bound to result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become government policy , that is , matters beyond the scope of a court 16 or the judgment of the citizens . Under the controls they recommend such matters must be decided by a three-headed government official , judge , lawmaker and lawenforcer ( three in one ) ? a bureaucrat.17 That certainly is not democracy ! Under such circumstances , it may appear that government by the people really is brought about , that a whole new set of political rights have been developed to protect the individual , but in practice it eliminates political rights and the basic property rights upon which the average citizen has to depend for his security . It makes the government the general employer , an employer who can call upon the police , the Army or the Navy for help whenever he wants to , and who may disregard courts , legislators and laws with impunity since he represents  | Footnote  | sovereignty . Such procedure may be necessary , but it is tyranny , not democracy.18 The " liberals " say that this is all nonsense because they will see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why trust them ? They are human beings who will receive more power as government control develops . It should not be hard to understand that when government has reduced its citizens to economic dependence , the political rights with respect to voting and the theory of short term of office , independent courts , etc. , are also reduced to outright shams , and may , with a few touches , become the Frankenstein which will destroy the benefactor as well as the bene ficiary.19 The repercussions in Europe should make it clear that government control as recommended by the " liberals " will force into discard the local political rights which are enjoyed under state , city and county subdivisions , and particularly that aspect of the constitutional trinity which involves independent courts . As the principle of independent judges is one of the most important democratic aspects of government for protection of political rights , their forced subordinate position under social democracies will be discussed in the next few paragraphs , and more particularly in the next chapter . The judges during the Roosevelt administration knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Constitution.2 ? But the public-sentiment pressure for temporary governmental benefits was so great that they may have believed that resistance would be more harmful than acquiescence . The courts , therefore , were in a most difficult position and were certainly pushed a long way from their true relationship to citizens and government . They were obliged to concur in administration policies and did so on some plausible basis which allowed them to escape , to some extent , from  | Footnote  | the conviction and condemnation of their conscience that they had disregarded their oaths to defend the Constitution ? had properly protected public welfare.21 But under such circumstances almost everything is administrative policy and , therefore , under the control of bureaus and protected by laws which are declared to be righteous and constitutional . What else can the courts do but follow ? Any other course would find them bickering with their creator , or biting the hand that feeds them . This awkward position of the courts upset lawyers and statesmen so much that they " kindly " overlooked the elementary proposition that if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constitutional ; and that if it is contrary to public welfare , there is a presumption that it is unconstitutional . The courts were brought into line by accusing them of making the Constitution more important than public welfare , 22 a ridiculous and " embarrassing situation for the judges . The lawyers who defend free enterprise in the new-deal days , instead of showing that these laws would be detrimental to public welfare ( after all , the only issue , but a very difficult one ) spent their breath on the commerce clause.23 No doubt , political entanglements , in many cases , prompted such action . Self-interest obliged the legislators to feel and claim that these laws were remedies . But their hasty passage was not so great a reflection upon statesmen as were the reflections on the lawyers for the hasty arguments against them , after these laws had been in force and had furnished positive or conclusive evidence that they worked against public welfare ? were indeed , self-confessed unconstitutional laws . Surely , with revolution threatened as a consequence if the laws were declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument on other grounds then the ambiguous commerce clause . That the regulation by government ( which means political regulation ) of prices of commodities , wages , hours , labor , control of crops and distribution of benefits as practiced by the " liberals " was not in the minds of the Forefathers when they wrote the commerce clause should be obvious . To maintain that these things come within the scope of that clause implies that every aspect of daily life is embraced within it and makes that clause more important than the Constitution itself . It has been worked to death in connection with matters that are clearly governmental policy . The same is true of the so-called liberty , contract and due process clauses . Moreover , one can hardly expect a judge who must be an expert in judicial problems to be an expert also in determining whether a certain law will protect public welfare from a purely economic standpoint . Laws which require judges to become economic experts are probably unconstitutional because they force judges out of their intended field of authority . The enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if they are harmful or detrimental to public welfare , then Lord Coke , Associate Justices Chase , McReynolds , Brandeis and Roberts were right when they said courts should nullify them.24 Under constitutional government , laws relating to policy , of course , may come before the court to be declared unconstitutional on the ground that they impair , upset , interfere with or destroy the proper relationship to each other of the courts , states , legislators , voters and the executive , as pointed out by Chief Justice Marshall in the Marbury case . And , if they do that , who should honor them or fail to resist them ? And if they do not , but they are nevertheless obnoxious , then they  | Footnote  | must be tested , on the ground of public welfare , outside of the written Constitution , and repealed through the good sense of the legislators or nullified by court interpretation under the unwritten constitution because of the resistance to them by the citizens in the courts , or otherwise.25 Destruction or Impairment of Free Speech Free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every citizen in office as well as out of office should protect . And by free speech one must mean that the citizen maintain a relationship toward his government which will in nowise blind his eyes to its sins and faults ? and that is impossible where there are too many in the position . of governmental beneficiaries as government clerks , mortgagors , creditors , debtors , contractors , pensioners , etc . A hundred thousand government clerks and an equal number of outright beneficiaries in a population of one hundred million might not adversely affect free speech ( criticism of government ) , but when one-fifth of the population is directly associated with the government through jobs , pensions , relief , contracts , loans and obligations , the whole political structure of the government is changed , changed to such an extent that constitutional government as contemplated by the Forefathers must be abandoned . Under such circumstances , there will be no one who will dare to criticize government , or if he has good judgment care to do so , or will be strong enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he complain he would probably be attacking friends , cutting away their benefits , or obligating himself to support them . The only criticism under such circumstances that is tolerated is that the government is not giving enough . That is the reason why benevolent dictatorships , or what are now called democracies , force  | or push a country into bankruptcy and permanent destitution , poverty and distress , as well as into wars to cover up mistakes . The main check ? free speech , criticism of corruption in government , is dead . Voters and politicians are human beings with the same objective , namely , accumulate as much as possible in order to add to their security , and consequently if the door is ajar they will probably founder themselves ; not because they are vicious , but because if there is an opportunity to gain benefits their need or ambition will lead their judgment astray , and their utilization of the ballot , a phase of free speech , will result in their destruction . The presumption that human beings ( no matter how honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts , laws and penalties found in civilization , and the restriction on ballots expressed in constitutions and general legislation . There is plenty of misery for people living under government built on the principle of private property , free enterprise , capitalism , open competition , etc. , but such a form of government is the only form under which free speech from a political standpoint can exist . And under that , generally , about onethird of the people are poorly provided for , and of such onethird , many absolutely destitute . But the types of government which the world , including the United States , is embracing today in the name of humanitarianism and liberalism , no matter how kind and intelligent the leaders may be , eventually will have about three-fourths of the citizens not only poorly provided for but permanently destitute , for the simple reason , and it can not be repeated too often , that when government becomes a benefactor to too many people , free speech in the real and proper sense of the word dies and corruption and privilege for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  | criticize properly the power which has direct control over its existence . That is just as true in government as it is the family circle , the workshop , the church , between lover and sweetheart , or between employer and employee . All government officials and especially the judges are presumed to recognize the disposition of citizens , particularly those who are beneficiaries , not to criticize the government . That is why free speech is so strongly fortified in the Constitution and why laws and courts are so liberal in allowing citizens to criticize government . Every government is prone to have too many beneficiaries ; generally , so many that criticism obviously fair and constructive is very dangerous to indulge in and usually futile ; often absolutely futile , until a hurricane of economic distress breaks over the land . But that situation is intensified to the maximum when the citizen , in general , looks to the government for his food , shelter , profit , or luxuries . Free speech is never denied the citizen by a law openly stating that objective . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the citizen in order to obtain benefits earned or unearned , and then lost because the citizen is paralyzed with fear because he has become dependent upon government for his existence in the form of pensions , food , clothes , homes , employment , and outright relief . The business man is in the same relationship for he has to rely on government for the material to conduct his business . Congress , under the theory that promotion of industry helps everybody ( which of course is true ) , started with governmental benefits to industry . That laid the foundation for benefits in other places and subsequently forced the government to give benefits , often unearned ones , to all ? railroads , schools , manufacturers , labor unions , farmers , youths , the aged , the employed , the unemployed , the sick , the healthy , rich and poor .
