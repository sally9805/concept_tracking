Into Pittsburgh one day last week rolled a cream-colored station wagon loaded with Polish highway officials and powered by high-octane U.S. diplomacy . Shepherded by a U.S. Bureau of Public Roads official , the four visiting Poles peppered Pennsylvania experts with questions on road-building materials and mechanization , marveled at superhighways , ogled multi-colored U.S. cars . Though few Pennsylvanians stopped to ogle back , the Poles were nevertheless important . Like another Polish delegation busy last week observing U.S. corn-raising techniques in Iowa , they were flesh-and-blood manifestations of a new warmth in U.S.-Polish relations . <P> The warmth was kindled a year ago when President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles pledged that rebellious Poles and Hungarians could henceforth " draw on our abundance to tide themselves over the period of economic adjustment .

To Washington came an economic delegation that negotiated an agreement for $95 million worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more . In addition , the U.S. eased restrictions on the shipment of strategic goods to Poland , upped exports so that more dollars worth of goods have already been delivered so far this year than were shipped all of last year . The Poles have increased exports to the U.S. , e.g. , canned hams , Christmas ornaments , have leveled the ratio of their trade to the East and West from 70-30 a year ago to 55-45 now . <P> Trade is only one element in this U.S. strategy of " enlightened liberation . " While exchange teams come to the U.S. to study highways , farming , home building and steel production , U.S. experts tour Poland to inspect and suggest . Ten times as many U.S. citizens are visiting Poland this year as went last year . American movies are being shown again for the first time since the Communists took control of the country . Both the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations are arranging grants to provide exchange students . One of the most dramatic examples of the new policy at work was the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 24 ) . <P> Watching the flow of aid , trade and ideas , a State Department observer last week summed up the U.S. attitude towards its Polish experiment : " It is a calculated risk . But what we could gain is great , what we could lose is relatively insignificant . "
