txt A " buy and invest in Boston " campaign was urged today upon individual citizens and the area 's 60,000 business firms . A program of " concerted action " to build up bank balances in ? Boston banks so they might help finance greater business activity in the area and to allocate insurance to local companies so they might invest more heavily in local enterprises was advocated by Ernest Henderson , president of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce . Mr. Henderson laid his plan before members of the Rotary Club of Boston at the Hotel Statler , as he urged Boston business firms to take these steps toward meeting the challenge set by some of the more rapidly growing regions of the United States . When it comes to investments by the insurance companies , he said , " why should they not use local brokerage firms and local investment bankers ? These , in turn , circulate vast sums of dollars in Greater Boston . Canvass Proposed " Why not canvass our own local industries or services before placing orders outside of our community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all help each other . " Mr. Henderson , who also is president of the Sheraton Corporation of America , urged not only these new lines of action , but the production of more new products . " It could mean more sales , more jobs , more money to be spent in this area . More workers at good pay could start a chain reaction whose ultimate link would be greater prosperity for all , " he added . Pointing out some of the problems faced in this area , Mr. Henderson said : " We need more tax revenues to expand our schools and to increase teachers ' salaries . We also need lower rates of taxes to attract more business to this area . " Tracing the patterns of prosperity and growth of such centers as Los Angeles , Omaha , Dallas , New Orleans , and others , he asserted that " growth and prosperity , which seem to go hand in hand , are usually the result of planning it that way . " New Orleans Cited " The creation of New Orleans 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th position to second among the seaports of the eastern half of our country , " he said . " Omaha , with the help of its Industrial Development Corporation financed from millions from public-spirited individuals and firms , is literally lifting itself by its bootstraps through the process of attracting new industries to eastern Nebraska , " he added . By . way of implementing the program he outlined , Mr. Henderson said that " first , the idea must be sold to our local and state legislative officers who control an important key to local prosperity . " The second objective in carrying out our program for greater prosperity is to convince labor leaders that the community 's best interest as well as that of the workers of industry . . . is better served by a long-range program to ? build up New England industry than by considering only the immediate short-range advantages of the workers they represent . " When the workingman realizes the advantages to him of a long-range program for creating prosperity , I am sure he will cast his vote  --  whether it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-range prosperity of Greater Boston , for he will be one of the first to reap the benefits . Businessman 's Role " But , " he added , " the businessman , too , must contribute to this concerted action . He can not expect cooperation from labor and political circles while he stands aside merely to harvest some of the benefits of greater prosperity . " He , too , must contribute to the program , and , indeed , the lion 's share . " As the final link in our program to raise industrial prosperity in our area , we should mobilize the support of our local educators , who represent one of the region 's most valuable raw materials , " Mr. Henderson said . " Businessmen should meet with educators more often and learn to understand their problems more fully , and see that they receive a fairer share of the great benefits of a free enterprise society . " Likewise , educators should realize that increasing the scope and effectiveness of production and distribution provides the one most effective method of increasing the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . " Prosperity is everybody 's business , and only by pulling together can we achieve the maximum goals . "
