At Iowa State College last week , some 800 delegates , claiming to represent 800,000 U.S. college undergraduates , wound up the annual congress of the U.S. National Student Association . In ten days of argument and discussion , resolutions and amendments , one thing was clear : there was not a wild eye in the house . The N.S.A. , born in 1947 to a rough and tumble fight over controversial issues ( e.g. , racial discrimination , banning of Communist teachers , etc. ) had gone conservative , in expression even more than in politics . <P> When one group proposed to seek a U.S.-Russian student-exchange program to further " communication " -a surefire controversy in 1948-there was little inflamed oratory . The motion was merely voted down , 235-69 . An almost inevitable resolution on segregation packed a surprise : it was far milder than the U.S. Supreme Court ban , was challenged only by four Northern delegates-for its severity . Joe McCarthy was routinely deplored , rather than denounced ; not even a stouthearted right-winger rose to Red-bait in reply . Nor did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and U.M.T. ( rejected by N.S.A. in 1952 ) . Said one N.S.A. officer : " We 're pretty well resigned to all that . "
