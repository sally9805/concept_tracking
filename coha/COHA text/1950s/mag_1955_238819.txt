Last week 's theater of Democratic politics had a familiar look . In one act was Adlai Stevenson , with another skilled , polished performance . In another was Harry S. Truman , the 71-year-old trouper , still giving ' em hell . <P> The idea for the Stevenson script originated in the bouncy political organization of Minnesota 's Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey , whence came the suggestion that Stevenson , as a peg for taking off on the Eisenhower Administration , might recall the 1952 campaign day when both Adlai and Ike traveled to Kasson , Minn. , to set forth their farm policies . <P> Stevenson wrote a letter to Kasson Farmer Henry Snow , in whose pasture the candidates had appeared . Excerpts : <P> " I drove into Kasson that day just as General Eisenhower drove out , and I have a vivid memory of the excitement with which I was told that Candidate Eisenhower had not merely endorsed the support of basic farm prices at 90% of parity but had come out for 100% of parity . The distinct and , I fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government supports of 100% parity , while at the same time endorsing his party 's platform pledge to abandon all production controls . . . <P> " Since that day three years ago the farm situation has steadily worsened under an Administration that embraces flexible price supports while maintaining distressing rigidity of mind . . . The current farm distress is dangerous to our whole economy in an age of ever-closer economic interdependencies . If it continues , it must inevitably affect the prosperity so arduously fostered through 20 years of Democratic Government ... " <P> <P> Drowned Out . The press play was less than expected . As had happened before , Stevenson 's carefully cadenced sentences could hardly be heard against the din of Harry Truman . <P> In Detroit for a Labor Day speech , Truman was in mid-campaign form . The Democratic nominee in 1956 , cried Truman , will " not be the kind of man who will give you a big smile and some nice promises in the political campaign and then turn you over to your enemies for the next four years . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Administration dominated by big business , an Administration concerned more with dollars than with people . <P> The prospect of the A.F.L. C.I.O. merger , said Truman , is " scaring the daylights out of the Republicans , " and there is evidence that " Republican politicians are getting ready to play pretty rough next year . " Then he looked up from his text and added : " If the Democratic Party invites me into the campaign , they 'll get all the ' rough ' they want . "
