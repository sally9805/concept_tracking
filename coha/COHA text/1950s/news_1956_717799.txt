txt The Republicans presented a new state income tax reduction plan today . It would provide cuts of $40.000.000 instead of the $50,000,000 in the program vetoea ay uovernor tiarriman . The leaders of the party in control of the Legislature offered the new plan with the stated purpose of meeting Governor Harriman 's objections to their original plan . The Governor immediately countered with ? a statement indicating that the new plan was as unsatisfactory as the first . The impression of his statement was that he could not approve any income tax reduction unless it was coupled with increased gasoline taxes to finance a highway construction program . Senator Walter J. Mahoney , majority leader , and Oswald D. Heck , Speaker of the Assembly , announced the new plan in a statement here . Senator Mahoney repeated the announcement in an appearance on a WRCA-TV program in New York . The first plan proposed a credit of 20 per cent on the first $100 of the income tax due April 15 and a credit of 10 per cent on the next $400 , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today 's revised proposal would forgive 15 per cent of the first $100 and 10 per cent of thb next $200 for a maximum of $35 . Senator Mahoney and Speaker Heck said that the , aim was to " offer the Governor one final opportunity to make good on his statement that he favors income tax reduction for the people . " Governor Harriman has urged a $40,000,000 cut by a system that would give to each taxpayer credits of $5 for himself // and for each of his dependents . Commenting on the new Re- publican proposal , the ir%Nernor said : " Although the new Republican proposal is $10,000,000 lower it is based on the same principle . as the bill I vetoed . " If the Republican leaders are sincere why do n't they either pass the Democratic bill , which gives greater relief to low and middle income taxpayers and those with large families , or else attempt to work out a compromise as we did with the humanizing amendments ? " We have also got to look at , how we are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican failure to provide new revenues for that purpose . " In their joint statement Senator Mahoney and Speaker Heck said : " The absurdity of the Governor 's contention that the ear- i lier Republican bill , which he , vetoed , provided too much tax reduction for those in the upper brackets is self-evident from the fact that the amount of tax sav ing to any taxpayer under it would have been $60 . The maximum reduction under our modified bill is $35 . " Our modified tax reduction plan is being submitted after providing fully and adequately for ( 1 ) launching , without a motor fuel tax increase , a highway construction program which will make available all the money the Governor has indicated he could spend for this purpose next year as well as all required under the Diefendorf Commission 's program . ( 2 ) increased state aid for schools over and above the Heald Commission 's recommendations , ( 3 ) development of a plan to meet the capital needs of the State University and ( 4 ) all of the other essential needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various special appropriation bills . " The references were to  --  the Temporary Commission on Highway Finance , headed by Charles H. Diefendorf , and to the Temporary Educational Finance Commission , headed by Dr. Henry Towley Heald , Chancellor of New York University . The new turn in the tax-cut issue is ? not likely to delay the scheduled final adjournment of the Legislature latg this week. , Many major items of legislation remain to be acted upon , but bipartisan agreements have been reached on many and agreements on others are in the making . Outside of taxation , the major , unresolved issue involves compulsory liability insurance for automobile owners . A bill covering this was approved in the Assembly last week and is regarded to have a good chance of Senate approval this week , despite strong opposition . On highway construction it appears certain that the Legislature will approve , subject to a referendum , . a $500,000,000 bond issue as recommended by the Diefendorf commission . It seems likewise clear that it will not approve an increase in gasoline taxes to support this bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman . Instead , it will rely on money that otherwise would have gone for tax reduction to meet this need for the next year , at least . A bi-partisan agreement has been reached to enact the rec-1 ornmendations of the Heald Corn-1 mission , with modifications that ' will increase the cost to the state by $33,770,000 for a full school year .
