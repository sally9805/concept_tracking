Britain 's newly found boom could turn to bust . That was the clear implication of a series of drastic measures announced last week to the House of Commons by Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer Richard A. Butler . Amid jeers from the Labor benches and gasps from the Tories , Butler warned that Britain , which earned a surplus of $560 million last year , is slipping back into the red . Inflation threatens , the dollar gap is widening , sterling is depressed . <P> Ordinary Britons were bewildered , for all around were the Austins and Jaguars , the TV sets , and choice cuts of beef that mean tangible prosperity . Tory billboards boasted : " Conservative Freedom Works , " and judging by appearances , it did . But though British production and sales are the highest in history , neither hard work nor Tory free enterprise have been enough to free the island from its precarious economic geography . Britain depends for its life on the terms of world trade-on the relative amount of food and raw materials that it can earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> More Cars for Less Wheat . Of late , the terms of trade have changed to Britain 's detriment . A bad harvest in Europe sent the demand for foodstuffs soaring ; commodity prices rose , and last January Britain found itself paying 149% more a month for its imports of live animals for food , 145% more for animal feed . " In the last three months , " said the London Economist , " the adverse movement in the terms of trade has cut Britain 's annual rate of real income by 100 million . " <P> The British people , meanwhile , were celebrating their deliverance from austerity by indulging in a spending spree that resulted in manufacturers selling goods at home that could have been sold abroad . At the same time , the Tory government added to domestic demand by announcing a whole series of long-term development projects : hundreds of millions of dollars for the coal mines , $3.4 billion for the railroads , $420 million for highways , $840 million for nuclear power stations-in addition to Britain 's rearmament program of $4.3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in increased productivity . But coming on top of the nation 's demand for more houses , more cars , more exports , more arms and more investments in the Commonwealth , they impose a heavy strain on an economy a fraction the size and far less flexible than that of the U.S. Result : inflation at home , waning confidence in the pound sterling abroad . <P> Back to Austerity ? Rab Butler saw the danger when sterling began to fall on the free markets of Zurich and New York . Foreign exporters who could pick up pounds as low as $2.72 began undercutting British firms who were forced to finance their exports at the officially pegged rate of about $2.78 . Last week , as sterling grew weaker and " never-never buying " ( as the British call installment purchases ) sent British consumer indebtedness spiraling to $1.1 billion , Butler reimposed restrictions-and a small dose of austerity . <P> " What is needed , " Butler told the Commons , " are steps to moderate excessive internal demands , and so to match the increase in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
