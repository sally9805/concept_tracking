txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 10 ? The ' country 's first private atomic electric power plant will be built near New York City . The Consolidated , Edison Company of New York , Inc. , disclosed today before the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy that it planned to construct an atomic furnace with its own funds . The cost was put at $30 , - 000,000 to $40,000,000 . H. R. Searing , company president , said that the projected plant to feed electric energy into the Edison system for New York and Westchester would be at Indian Point on the Hudson River , five miles south of Peekskill , N. Y. He said . the company hoped to apply for a license from the Atomic Energy Commission before April 1 . Consolidated Edison is the first utility company to tell Congress it , is ready to go ahead , iwithout Government aid , since the Atomic ' Energy Act of 1954 opened the door to private industry for peaceful uses of the atom . Mr. Searing told the committee , that his company had asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment manufacturers to present proposals " for a reactor of about 100,000 to 200,000 kilowatts which could be suitably fitted into our system . " It was learned that the company hoped for an atomic reactor that would producA 125,000 kilowatts . Mr. Searing said later that he expected it would be at least a year before the company could start construction because of necessary design and fabrication work . He estimated also that a " minimum of four years " would be required before the plant would be ready for service . The site selected was formerly an amusement park , a regular port of call for the old Hudson River Day Line streamers . The company acquired the park ground and additional land to make a total Of 350 acres , Mr.1 Searing said . Edison announced Oct. 8 that it would build a multi-million-dollar electric generating plant at Indian Point , with provision for possible conversion to the use of atomic power . At the time , it said it would be constructed in anticipation of a 300 per cent increase in the demand for electric power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised the company 's announcement . Representative Carl ' T. Durham , Democrat of North Carolina , told Mr. Searing , " You 're the only man who has said we 're , going ahead and do thin job ! " Mr. Durham and other committee members frequently have been critical of private industry 's slowness in getting to work on a full-scale atomic power plant . Mr. Durham was joined by Senator Clinton P. Anderson , Democrat of New Mexico and committee chairman , and Representative W. Sterling Cole , ReThe New York Times Feb. 11. 1955 ATOM POWER : Cross indicates site where Consolidated Edison will build big reactor to supply ' electricity . publican of upstate New York . Mr. Cole and Senator Anderson asked whether Mr. Searing thought the rules and regulations of the Atomic Energy Commission were slowing the entrance of private industry into the new field . Mr. Searing replied that he d - not believe so . He said the company wat guided by two fundamental principles . " We believe , " he Declared , " tha . the proper approach was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would any other addition to our system and to go about purchasing of a reactor in the same way we would order a finished product from one of our usual suppliers if possible at a firm price . " The second fundamental principle was that we would finance the plant ourselves and that we would not seek Government assistance . " A tacit assumption in our thinking was that we should accept whatever charges or prices the commission established for material used or produced in the reactor . " Accordingly , Mr. Searing went on , principal attention was given to the economics of a reactor as a power producer . " In this connection we had very , much in mind the fact that the costs of conventional fuels in the New York area are relatively high , " he said . The price the Government charged for nuclear materials to be used in the reactor and the prices paid by the Government for any material produced in the atomic furnaces were " not a factor in our decision , " he said . Prices involved were relatively small against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government retains ownership of all nuclear material and charges a rental for use of such material . He said Edison had been negotiating with the General Electric Company , Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company , and the Babcock &; Wilcox Company , of New York . The proposal by ' Babcock &; Wilcox , a major boiler manufacturer , appeared to be the " most attractive , " he said . The reactor being considered is known as a converter . It is not one of five types of reactors that the A. E. C. has in its reactor demonstration program . The converter uses Uranium 238 and produces plutonium from this nuclear material . The small amounts of plutonium produced may be used to keep firing the atomic furnace . Mr. Searing said that the converter techniques produced an " over-all result which we hope will be reasonably competitive with conventional plants in our area . " He did not think it appropriate to spell out details of cost estimates at this time . A modern conventional steam plant producing 125,000 kilowatts would cost about $20,000,000 , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactor is under construction at Shippingsport , Pa . It is a joint venture of the A. E. C. and the Duquesne Light Company of Pittsburgh . Its projected capacity is 100,009 kilowatts . Westinghouse is building the reactor , known as a pressurized water reactor.
