Overturning the unanimous recommendation of the U.S. Tariff Commission , President Eisenhower last week rejected a plea by the New England fishing industry that he raise the tariff on groundfish fillets ( i.e. , boneless cuts stripped from pollock , cod , haddock , other bottom fish ) and thus protect beleaguered U.S. ground fishermen against further imports ( now 128 million Ibs. - annually , three times higher than in 1945 ) , chiefly from Canada , Iceland and Norway . While fully aware of the domestic problem , explained the President , " I am ... reluctant to impose a barrier to our trade with friendly nations " - and especially with nations whose " economic strength is of strategic importance to us . " Moreover , " I am not persuaded that the tariff hike would constitute a sound step in resolving the domestic industry 's difficulties " - at the heart of which , Administration spokesmen have pointed out , are declining U.S. catches caused by such made-in-the-U.S. problems as overfishing in local waters and aging vessels .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
