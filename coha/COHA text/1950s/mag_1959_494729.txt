BOOKS AND THE ARTS In his autobiography , Conclusive Evidence , Vladimir Nabokov devotes a few pages to discussing the emigre Russian writers whom he knew in Berlin and Invitation to a Beheading by Vladimir Nabokov Translated by Dmitri Nabokov ( Putnam 's ; $3.95 ) Paris before 1939 : Bunin , Poplayski , Rodasevich , " But , " he goes on , " the author that interested me most was naturally Sirin . He belonged to my generation . Among the young writers produced in exile he turned out to be the only major one . Beginning with the appearance of his first novel in 1925 and throughout the next fifteen years , until he vanished as strangely as he had come , his work kept provoking an acute and rather morbid interest on the part of critics . Just as Marxist publicists of the eighties in old Russia would have denounced his lack of concern with the economic structure of society , so the mystagogues of emigre letters deplored his lack of religious insight and of moral preoccupation . Everything about him was bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , for example , an American shocks so dangerously today , when in the presence of Soviet military men of distinction he happens to lounge with both hands in his trouser pockets . Conversely , Sirin 's admirers made much , perhaps too much , of his unusual style , brilliant precision , functional imagery and that sort of thing . Russian readers who had been raised on the sturdy straightforwardness of Russian realism and had called the bluff of decadent cheats , were impressed by the mirror-like angles of his clear but weirdly misleading sentences and by the fact that the real life of his books flowed , in his figures of speech , which one critic has compared to ' windows giving upon a contiguous world . . . a rolling corollary , the shadow of a train of thought . ' Across the dark sky of exile , Sirin passed , to use a simile of a more conservative nature , like a meteor , and disappeared , leaving nothing much else behind him than a vague sense of uneasiness . His best works are those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their souls . " Sirin is , of course , Nabokov himself in his Russian-writing days , and the whole passage is typical of the elaborately joking manner which he likes to assume ( compare the " Ph.D . ' s " introduction to Lolita ) , and which one suspects is a very Russian kind of humor which English and American readers find amusing and irritating in about equal proportions . The quotation from " a critic " is no doubt all part of the joke , since " windows giving upon a contiguous world " is exactly the kind of pretentious phrase , reverberative but totally meaningless , which abound in the Higher Reviewing . Still , the general drift of the passage no doubt represents an attitude which Nabokov seriously holds ; it is true that " Marxist " critics ( whether of the " eighties " or the present day ) would consider his work frivolous in its disregard of questions arising from social organization , and that critics of a contrasting tendency would see the same frivolity in his lack of religion and moral questioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are certainly outweighed by thoughts and emotions of a more strictly subjective kind . The chief of these is memory . As an emigre , compelled to leave his native country at the age of twenty or so and thereafter to regard it simply as a country that has vanished from the map , Mr. Nabokov is fascinated by the work ings of his own memory , and thence in the psychology of memory in general . All his books are punctuated with little vignettes drawn from his recollections of the sights , sounds and tactile sensations , of those first twenty years , and some of the " stories " collected in Nabokov 's Dozen ( 1958 ) are not stories at all but simply slabs of remembered detail . " First Love , " for instance , is a jewel of this kind . Indeed , Nabokov does think of these objets trouv ? s , lying about haphazard in the memory , as being like jewels , which he takes out , lingers fondly over for a moment , and then puts back in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with him in London last November . " Mademoiselle 0 , " another of the sketches in that book , begins with an interesting statement on this theme : " I have often noticed that after I had bestowed on the characters of my novels some treasured item of my past , it would pine away in the artificial world where I had so abruptly placed it . Although it lingered on in my mind , its personal warmth , its retrospective appeal had gone and , presently , it became more closely identified with my novel than with my former self , where it had seemed to be so safe from the intrusion of the artist . Houses have crumbled in my memory as soundlessly as they did in the mute films of yore ; and the portrait of my old French governess , whom I once lent to a boy in one of my books , is fading fast , now that it is engulfed in the description of a childhood entirely unrelated to my own . The man in me revolts against the fictionists and here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Mademoiselle . " In other words , once the jewels of memory are cut into the required shape to fit into an alien pattern , they are spoilt . It is perhaps this realization that has led Mr. Nabokov , during the last ten years , to stop his ears against the song of memory and concentrate on the American present tense of his life , rather than the European past . Pnin and THE NEW REPUBLIC Lolita are both essentially critiques of American life which come naturally from a sensibility nourished in the Old World . I say " a sensibility " because Nabokov , despite the obvious fineness and originality of his mind , does not show much trace of having a generalizing intellect . He is , in that respect , the , typical artist who distrusts " ideas . " Nabokov has expended a lifetime 's devoted effort on the task of developing and refining an absolutely individual style , which will convey the thousand and one idiosyncratic nuances suggested by his imagination ; both in English and ( according to Marc Slonim ) in Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of utter perfection . And yet it is remarkable that he has never troubled to develop a style in which ordinary generalized thought ( political opinions , for instance ) can be conveyed . When he modulates from distilled impressions into the ordinary statement of an opinion , his writing plummets abruptly from the height of felicity into vagueness and fumbling ; In Conclusive Evidence , for instance , t le sheer driving current of the narrative compels him , now and again , to make some kind of reference to his political attitudes ; after all , he was a political refugee , his father was a statesman and a well-known political theorist who edited a great liberal newspaper . But - no doubt owing to Nabokov 's distaste for anything so crude , so common to all men , as political opinions - the prose collapses into this kind of thing : " I soon became aware that if my views , the not unusual views of Russian democrats abroad , were received with pained surprise or polite sneers by English democrats in situ , another group , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so from such crude reactionary motivation that I was only embarrassed by their despicable support . Indeed , I pride myself with having discerned even then the symptoms of what is so clear today , when a kind of family circle has gradually been formed , linking representatives of all nations , jolly Empire-builders in their jungle clearings , the unmentionable German product , the good old church-going Russian or Polish pogrornshchik , the lean American lyncher , the man with the bad teeth who squirts anti-minority stories in the bar or the lavatory , and , at another point of the same sub-human circle , those ruthless , paste-faced automatons in singularly wide trousers and high-shouldered coats , those Sitzriesen , whom or shall I say which ? - the Soviet State has brought out on such a scale after thirty years of selective breeding . This is going too far round : all Nabokov is saying is that people who oppose individual human freedom can be found at any point on the political spectrum , and that under their much-advertised differences resemble each other far more than they resemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an over-elaborate manner is like touching off a firework display merely to look at one 's watch in a dark street . I labor this point because it seems to offer a way into the heart of . Nabokov 's work . He has always been a favorite writer of mine , and yet , when I came to read a number of his books one after another in preparation for this article , I found the experience fatiguing and had to make frequent stops ; it was like exercising one set ' of muscles while keeping the rest of my body still . There is too little break to his intolerable deal of sack . The author 's passion for analyzing the minutiae of sensation and emotion will not allow him to go in a straight line from A to B. In the midst of an account of his studies at Cambridge , in those first years of exile in which he was haunted by the fear of losing " the only thing I had salvaged from Russia - her language , " he will break off to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sheet of newspaper . . I would heap on more coals and help revive the flames by spreading a sheet of The London Times over the smoking black jaws of the fireplace , thus screening completely its open recess . A humming noise would start behind the taut paper , which would acquire the smoothness of drum-skin and the beauty of luminous parchment . Presently , as the hum turned into a roar , an orange-coloured spot would appear in the middle of the sheet , and whatever patch of print happened to be there for example , The League does not command a guinea or a gun , ' or ? the revenges that Nemesis has h.ad upon Allied hesitation and indecision in Eastern and Central Europe . .1 stood out with ominous clarity-until suddenly the orange spot bursts . Then the flaming sheet , with the whirr of a liberated phoenix , would fly up the chimney to join the stars . " It is superb , of course , and to open a book of Nabokov 's and come upon such a passage ( as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a tingle of de- : light . But that tingle , endlessly repeated ; becomes a kind of Chinese torture . I do n't , however , want to present a picture of Nabokov , as a mere aesthetic ' trifler . He may not be very interested in opinions , but a strong set of attitudes is clearly visible in his work , and the fa-. tiguing , cloying flavor of his books is due more to an over-elaborate surface than to an inner emptiness . In " real , life , " Mr. Nabokov is a well-known lepidopterist , and he has picked up one habit from his pets : he can not fly in a straight line . A butterfly 's purposes are as serious as yours and mine , but it is condemned to give this impression of frivolity by the protective wavering of its flight . So with Nabokov He can not , . under any circumstances , " get on . " ' There are moments when the most patient reader longs to say to hint ( as some-body is supposed to have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papa 's hand ! " Nothing , I suppose , will change him ? and indeed the idea of so delightful an author 's being changed is an . unwelcome one . But , change or not , there is certainly a development . It is a little hard to be certain without having read everything he has written , and for this we must wait until all the Russian nov- els , published in the thirties under the name of " Sirin , " are translated and reissued , like this one . But I fancy that when Mr. Nabokov 's oeuvre can be seen as a whole , the books of his " American period " will prove to have more substance , less of a ghost-like quality , than his " European " work . For one thing , America has given Mr. Nabokov a more stable and workaday life . Academic society may be artificial , but it can hardly be as artificial as the life of the ? migr ? Russian colony in Berlin in the twenties , or the more dispersed and etiolated version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade later . There is , in America , nothing strange about being an expatriate . The society is not yet tightly-woven enough to present a hard , impenetrable surface to the " foreigner " ; even an Englishman can assimilate , and a cosmopolitan European more easily still . This means that Mr. Nabokov has now , in middle life , something definite to write about . Lolita , for example , has all the fanciful quality of his earlier books , but it is also a substantial work of social satire . Marc Slonim , another emigre in America , has said roundly that , " Nabokov laughs at the smooth facade of American middle-class gentility which finds everything perfectly wonderful , at the routine of wonderful . . . . He hits at the monotony and dullness of hotels and motels which encircle the vast continent , he derides the mixture of puritanism , Freudianism and shallowness which infects American colleges , and he debunks the big myths of a commercialized society of sellers , buyers , athletes and entertainers : the myth of youth which turns into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , and the myth of quantity which has drowned the idea of excellence in all areas of human endeavor . Lolita herself becomes a typical image of the American starlet ? a mixture of external attractiveness and basic vulgarity , of sound rationality and senseless violence . " In the same way , Pnin ( perhaps the most perfect of Nabokov 's books ) is not only the funniest of that curious subcategory of novels dealing with campus life , but also an unforgettable picture of a profound commentary on racial character : an old-fashioned liberal Russian patiently building a life on the alien planet of modern America . It is not satire ; Pnin is homeless not because America can not provide homes , but because for him the very idea of home has vanished ? or rather , he carries the idea wherever he goes , but the reality to which it corresponds has been destroyed . That is why Pnin can be absurd , touching and lovable , while never ceasing to have genuine grandeur . From what I have said up to now , a reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insubstantial writer , strong on the psychology of memory , on the less familiar reaches of the emotional life , and on certain imponderables such as the confrontation of different temperaments , racial and otherwise . All this is true , but there is one strong ? indeed , blazing ? emotion of a straight-forward , non-refined character that glows through all Nabokov 's work , and that is hatred of tyranny . I use the word " tyranny " rather than some more zoth-Century term such as " totalitarianism , " because the quality of Nabokov 's feeling here seems to me immemorial , even archaic ; as an artist ( i.e. an individual who will cease to exist if he abandons his individuality ) he hates the thought of a world in which the individual is denied the right to live and develop in his own way . An early short story , Cloud , Castle , Lake ( 1937 ) concerns a mild and thoughtful little man who is forced by a whimsical chance to accompany a party of hearty , leather-breeched tourists on a trip through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he feels an unearthly peace and serenity ; he announces his intention of staying there for ever , but his touring companions will not hear of it , and drag him away , beating him up at the same time , just for luck . " There will be beer at Ewald , " said Schramm in a caressing voice . " Five hours by train . Hikes . A hunting lodge . Coal mines . Lots of interesting things . " " I shall complain , " wailed Vassili Ivanovich . " Give me back my bag . I have the right to remain where I want . Oh , but this is nothing less than an invitation to a beheading . " The phrase forced from Vassili 's lips as they drag him away is like a sign-post pointing backward to the novel , written three or four years previously . Evidently the theme is one that haunts Nabokov 's imagination , or did until he exorcised it . Invitation to a Beheading is , on a first reading , less technically interesting than Nabokov 's later work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( though Nabokov denies that he knew Kafka at the time of the composition of this work ) with whom he had many imaginative qualities in common . One senses a literary debt to The Trial and The Castle . But Invitation to a Beheading is a book that haunts the memory ; it is only a few weeks since I first read it , but already I am beginning to suspect that it will stay in my mind , with a rather disconcerting tenacity . In his autobiography , Nabokov calls it " the most haunting " of Sirin 's books , " which deals with the incarceration of a rebel in a picture-postcard fortress by the buffoons and bullies of a Communazist state . " Cincinnatus , the victim , is a mild , dreaming , inoffensive man whose real crime is that he does not live in the glass-and-concrete world of his captors , any more than Pnin , Sebastian Knight , or ? for that matter ? Humbert could do . There is also an interesting anticipation of Lolita , in the shape of Emmie , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend of depravity and genuine childishness . In one heartbreaking scene , Cincinnatus escapes for a few moments from the fortress , and finds himself on a rocky hillside overlooking the town in which his life has been lived , and which is inexpressibly dear to him as he stands looking down on it . Emmie appears , he trustfully lets her take his hand and lead him , and she takes him straight in through a door to a drawing-room where her father and the other prison officials are at tea . Emmie , in short , leads Cincinnatus back to his captivity and execution , just as Lolita pilots Humbert down into the slough of his neurosis . It does n't strictly belong to the book Sirin was writing ; but most genuinely interesting writers have , in their early work , certain passages of which the reader says " Yes , this is interesting ? in view of what came later . " All in all , we must hope that Mr. Nabokov 's son Dmitri , who shares the father 's love of both the English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us a complete translation of the works of Sirin . There is a place waiting for them on the shelf of contemporary fiction .
