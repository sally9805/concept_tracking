Four weeks ago the U.S. Air Force fired off an explosive letter to its 28 major airframe and missile contractors . In fiscal 1958 's first quarter the Defense Department has spent its money at the rate of $40 billion annually , $2 billion more than its $38 billion budget . To help get back in line , the Air Force proposed a temporary cut averaging 25% in its monthly progress payments for aircraft production . But the Air Force still expected the industry to maintain full delivery schedules , either by cutting costs or borrowing money to keep going . Last week the replies were in , and they added up to one loud , angry yelp . Said one planemaker : " If the Department of Defense were private industry , it could be adjudged guilty of mismanagement punishable by law . " <P> Bankers &; Boeing . The industry obviously considered itself in serious trouble . Many companies operate so close to the line that they will be pressed to meet payrolls without 100% Air Force payments each month . Nor will it be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though full payment will come when the Air Force gets more money at the end of fiscal 1958 or when money loosens because of heavier Treasury receipts , the feast-and-famine aircraft business is such a questionable risk that few banks are eager to lend scarce funds . Those who do get interim financing may have to pay higher interest rates than other industries . And since the extra cost can not be recovered under most defense contracts , it will also mean a sharp cut in profit margins . <P> A prime example of the planemakers ' dilemma was Seattle 's Boeing Airplane Co. , the Government 's biggest defense contractor , with a $2.1 billion backlog of orders . Boeing faces the deferment of more than $350 million in payments due for the rest of fiscal 1958 . If the Air Force sticks to its new schedule , and the company can not expand its $100 million bank credit , Boeing will be forced into a major production slowdown , says senior Vice President Wellwood E. Beall . Boeing is already closing its 1500-worker plant at Everett , Wash. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preflight hangar at Moses Lake , Wash. , reduced its shop supply inventory , and cancelled its Christmas party this year . <P> Republic &; Lockheed . Outside of Douglas , which is in better shape than most because of a $150 million credit that can be transferred from its DC-8 commercial jet program , the rest of the major contractors are in bad shape . Republic , facing a 30% to 40% cut in payments for the rest of the fiscal year , blames the new payment schedule for a layoff of nearly 2,500 workers . Lockheed is also cutting back . So are the Martin Co. , North American and other major contractors . The picture is even darker for the thousands of subcontractors who sometimes do as much as 60% of the actual work on each plane . As prime contractors are forced in turn to defer payments or withdraw subcontracts , the Strategic Industries Association estimates that 500 subcontractors in Southern California alone will go under before year 's end .                 @ @ @ @
