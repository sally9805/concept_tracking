IT 'S quite a development , " said the slight young fellow next to me in the lounge car of the Ocean Limited , a train bound northeast out of Montreal . His name was Anker Hansen . We happened to be going to the same place ? he worked for the company that was developing the iron ore deposits of Labrador and Quebec , about which I intended to write an article . " Till now , there was nothing up there except a few Indians . By the way , you ought to talk to Bob Ross . He 's a fur buyer in Seven Islands . Speaks English , French , and several Indian dialects . Then you 'll want to talk to the geologists . And the construction men ? some of them are Americans . Then there 's a flier who was with one of those polar explorers , ca n't stand civilization .

And from Seven Islands it was two hours ' flight into the wilderness camp called Knob Lake where the iron ore lay . " The iron ore is on the boundarybetween Labrador and Quebec . They do n't know where Labrador starts and Quebec ends . For a long time , nobody cared . But now they do . " This summer , he said , the company 's big job was building a railroad from Seven Islands to Knob Lake-365 miles . " But the really spectacular thing in the whole project is the airlift . They have to fly everything in . They take a 225-foot steel radio tower and fly it in by bits and pieces . When you get to Knob Lake there 'll be a nice clean Plymouth station wagon meet you at the airstrip . Just remember , it was flown in there too . " 1 ABRADOR is a part of Newfoundland Province .

At its center is the iron ore ? at about the latitude of the lower end of Hudson 's Bay . For several years mining men have been talking about these wilderness ore deposits . It was becoming clear that the ranges in the American Lake Superior district , from which most of our iron ore comes , could not long be expected to meet the whole of our rising need for steel for defense and civilian uses , and that another major source of iron ore on this continent would be a great ? asset to America . Last year they began the task of opening up the deposits . This is a completely private undertaking . The Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. , a Canadian gold-mining company , owned concessions to the ore , but to develop them it needed capital , experience with iron ore , and ? probably most important ? a market for the ore . Only the American steel industry could provide all three . Hollinger enlisted the aid of the M. A. Hanna Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cleveland , Ohio . Hanna interested five American steel companies ? Armco , National , Republic , Wheeling , and Youngstown ? in guaranteeing a market for the ore . They and Hanna put up $100,000,000 , half the estimated cost . And nineteen insurance companies , four Canadian and fifteen American , agreed to loan them the other hundred million . ( The total cost eventually may rise close to $300,000,000 . ) To undertake the project , the corporations involved formed the Iron Ore Company of Canada . The Iron Ore Company in turn established three subsidiaries ? an airline , Hollinger Ungava Transport Ltd. ; a railroad , Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway Co. ; and a power company , Ungava Power . It hired a contracting company called CMMMK to build the railroad . This is the last big known undeveloped iron ore reserve on the North American continent , one of the last in the world . And it lies in one of the wildest , most remote regions of the continent ? a frozen , unmapped , uninhabited desolation . To bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few of its kind in our time : a striking example of pioneering by mid-twentieth-century methods . I went up there last August to see what was going on . T HE airport outside Mont Joli had been built by the RCAF during the war and looked it ? rows of barracks already deserted , a lonely runway beside the blue St. Lawrence . Airplane seats , propellers , engines were scattered about the hangar , and in one corner stood the fuselage of a Norseman plane , stripped to a naked spidery skeleton . In an upstairs office I found Charles Hoyt , the headof the company 's airlift . He was a big blond tousle-headed man in gabardine pants and a yellow-red-blue plaid shirt . He explained that materials for the project were brought by ship from Montreal to Seven Islands . From there they were flown to the construction camps strung up along the railroad route . During the war Hoyt , an old barnstormer , had been an RCAF Wing Commander flying construction materials to Goose Bay , Labrador . The contractor there , W. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ore Company . He asked Hoyt to set up an airlift . Hoyt now has thirty-two young pilots from his old RCAF squadron . He had thirteen planes ? three DC3s and ten smaller craft . In 1948 Hoyt 's airlift carried 2,044,785 pounds of freight ; in the first seven months of this year , four times as much . " What 's more , " Hoyt said , " we 've got our cost down to a nickel a pound . Compared to seventy-five cents that they 'd been paying a commercial airline to supply their prospectors . We can fly stuff cheaper than you can haul it over a tote road . Last December they sent a tractor and a crew in overland and by spring they were only a hundred miles along the way . Whereas we can put four tons of stuff in one of these airplanes and two hours later they 're there . By next year I hope the worst 'll be aver ? they 'll be building the railroad up in flatter ground , out of this valley at the lower end along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us we could n't fly into . You see , the valley is narrow . " He laughed without much mirth . " Awful narrow . I took a U. S. Air Force general into the airstrip at Mile 36 the other day and when we got down he said , ' Ah damn it , Hoyt , this is flying . Really flying , this is . ' Fifteen-hundredfoot mountains on either side . But hell , it 's safer than Montreal Airport ? no traffic . " Hoyt had a large rugged uneven face and a deep-cleft chin . " We sure rassled some stuff into 36 yesterday-17,000 gallons of gas , among other things . Came out on our last trip at nine o'clock at night . Every time we take a piece of machinery in we 've got to take in the gasoline to run it . We fly 1,000 gallons at a time . We 've got a DC3 rigged as a tanker . We 've flown in big tractor , scrapers , every damn thing you can think of . I forget how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want me to take over now , Scotty ? " In a moment there was the small grinding noise of the starting motors ; the propellers turned over erratically , then the engines caught , they throbbed and whined , and the plane rocked gently and swung onto the runway . The motors buzzed angrily , the plane shook and quaked , and we surged forward , the plane thrusting so hard we had to lean against it , bouncing roughly , feeling the friction of wheels beneath , and then the tail came up till the floor was level and quickly the bouncing stopped , was replaced by the soft spongy feeling of being airborne . We sailed out over the St. Lawrence , wide as a gulf ; and the passengers resumed the random chatter which they had ceased during the takeoff . Below , the water was streaked darkly . To the north toward Labrador , low clouds sat whitely on the dark gray hills . A tall slender young , man sitting opposite said to me in a quiet voice , " The thing that interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it 's to get away . To find some peace . " He was a geologist , taking a Ph.D . at Laval University and working for the company this summer . His father , a bricklayer , had come to Canada from Hungary in 1927 . " Now you probably wonder what I 'm doing here myself . Well , I had a chance of taking any course I wanted to in the university . I took geology . I love the outdoors and geology is a fascinating subject . And it is a field that offers the most opportunity . Especially in Canada , " and he talked about the vast unmapped regions of Ungava and the Northwest , only now being opened up . There was a sudden shout a couple of places away from me and a man across the way lunged to my side of the plane . A window at the emergency exit had blown open right behind one of the passengers and he was clinging to the bench , the airstream whooshing past loudly . Three men wrenched it shut . Everybody talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " See how sandy the shore is ? " said the young geologist , Steve Melihersik . " It 's all glacial drift . " The air was rougher , the plane rocked a little , and sometimes it bumped hard . I glanced at Scott , the pilot . He was reading a magazine . And now we began to descend . Melihersik said , " There 's Seven Islands ? can you count ' ern ? " I did , seven islands blotching the bay like measle spots . The sea on the shore looked frozen in ripplets . Then we were over the town , and , beyond , the triangular airport . Scott had quit reading now and had his headphones on . We sailed in low over a green-brown plain cut by a straight narrow band , the new railroad , still without steel , and then we were down . The door was opened and a ladder hung out and we climbed down , carrying our baggage . I N THE log hangar stood a dozen booted bearded men going up to Knob Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Islands , and we got into a truck beside a young theological student who visits the camps and holds religious services in the cookhouses . The road ran for six miles across a flat sandy plain . Dust filled the air , dust lay thick on the bushes at the roadside , dust choked your throat and nose . The plain was covered with scraggly little spruce trees . Melihersik said , " Here 's the town . " The street was unpaved , deep rutted in sand , narrow , very rough . The smell of burning pine was in the air . Scattered among the old weatherbeaten shingled houses were new houses , the lumber not yet painted , and piles of gravel and concrete blocks spilled out into the street . " They 're building in each other 's backyards , " said Melihersik . " The town 's in a terrible mess ? no sewage system , no water system , nothing . " Three or four laborers came swinging down the sidewalk noisily and , catching sight of a young pretty girl sawing wood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle and yell at her . She went into the house . We came down to the main street by the waterfront , where children skipped among the trucks and jeeps , and stopped . For here , arising suddenly from the sand and litter , was the new hotel , Hotel des Sept Iles , a three-story edifice of brick with glass-brick trim , the round concrete entrance painted a gay brilliant blue . We parked on clattering steel strips laid in the sand to protect cars from getting stuck . Melihersik promised to come around after dinner that night . In the lobby the furniture was new , of blond wood and pastel leather , and sansevieria plants flourished in a long wooden box , and the draperies were soft and luxuriant . Seven Islands ? often spelled Sept Iles ? is a French fishing village . It is one of the oldest towns on the North American continent . Jacques Cartier noted its bay in 1535 and the first Jesuit missionary arrived exactly three hundred years ago . Not much happened after that until last year . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hotel , no barroom , no movie , and few business establishments except the Hudson 's Bay Company store . Now all is changed . You can hear hammers everywhere . Two new streets have been opened , making four . Already the new hotel plans a new wing . Its owner intends to build another hotel up at Knob Lake as soon as the Iron Ore Company decides where it 'll put the town of Knob Lake . Hotel rooms , liquor , and food prices are about the same as in Montreal . Hotel bars are the only drinking places in town , so far as I learned . The only night club , called El Morocco , sells no liquor . Few prostitutes have come to town . A few cardsharps have shown up but no organized gambling has begun . The iron ore project employs about 3,000 people . Of these , 1,900 work for the railroad contractor CMMMK and the rest work for the Iron Ore Company , 600 at Knob Lake and 500 in or near Seven Islands . Most of them live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-boom population was about 1,600 ? commercial fishermen , pulpwood cutters , paper-mill workers . Now the permanent population has increased to 2,500 and only two men are still fishing . II T HAT first evening in Seven Islands Melihersik and I sat talking and drinking beer in the handsome soft-lit hotel cocktail lounge . I asked him to tell me about his work . " Well , we 're making a geological map , " he said . " Mapping the rock formation . We 've been in the bush all summer . I was out for a week on business . I 'm going back in tomorrow and I 'm not coming out till freezeup . In October , probably . I 'm a hundred miles up the railroad route . I have one man with me , a bushman . We sleep inan eight by twelve tent . We get up at 6:00 A. M. and prepare the breakfast , then hop into the canoe ? we have a one-and-a-half horsepower engine on it ? and go to the area we 're working in . " They traverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a compass Melihersik plots off an azimuth ? a directional course ? and the bushman marches 1,000 feet on the course . Melihersik examines the rocks at that point , identifies them geologically , plots the rock types on his aerial photographs ; and they continue on their course . The country where he 's working is rough ? sheer rock cliffs 400 or 500 feet high . " We can run about six miles of traverse a day . We take sandwiches and chocolate and oranges with us and cook tea . We usually work till about 4:30 . After supper I correlate my information and put it on the map and work out the geological relationships . We move camp every week or so . If possible , we move it ourselves ? portage . Or the plane moves us ? strap the canoe on the pontoons and fly over to the next spot . " ( The region is strewn with lakes which serve for landing fields . ) " We have arctic eiderdown sleeping bags , a small office box , a roll-top table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wet days . One thing you 're never without is fly dope . The flies and mosquitoes are terrible . We camp on sandy beaches . The canoe 's bright orange so it can be seen from the air . The plane comes every Wednesday . It brings food and mail and gasoline for your motor . " He was twenty-seven years old , blond , wearing glasses . " My bushman comes from Gaspe . He 's fifty-five . He can really handle a canoe . What do we talk about ? " He laughed . " He talks about women . And liquor . I just grunt . He chews tobacco and spits all over my tent . Smokes a vile pipe . But he 's a hell of a lot better to work with than a young student of geology . And he 'll show you things in the bush ? habits of animals and birds and fish ? you 'd never see otherwise . " The territory where he was working was uninhabited . " A few Indians come in to trap . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For bear . I have n't seen one this summer but the camp is full of tracks every morning . The same with caribou . The bush is loaded with partridge . Rabbits all over . Lots of ducks . My lake has a pair of loons . The streams are full of speckled trout and landlocked salmon . The lakes have mostly suckers and northern pike . " A concealed jukebox was booming steadily and the cocktail lounge was filling up . Two couples , the women in stoles and strapless dresses , sat down next to us , and I wondered where they could have come from . ( Later I learned there was a yacht club upstairs , patronized mostly by company men . ) Melihersik did n't seem to notice them . He said , " In the bush you do n't punch a clock , you 're under nobody 's supervision . You 're out on a traverse and there 's a nice hill up there an extra half mile away ? well , you do n't care , you want to know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round and round . " I guess I sort of hate civilization for one reason or the other . After you go back into the bush , after you 've been confined three or four days there , you attack those hills with so much energy just to ? I do n't know , " and he gestured . " Just to get rid of things . " 0 NE cool evening I found Dr. J. A. Retty , the chief geologist , riding in a jeep on the main street . He has been exploring here for fifteen years . In 1938 he found iron ore . ( It had been reported previously , in 1894 and 1929 , the first time on the basis of wrong evidence . ) I asked him about the geology of the region . " We have at the base of everything a series of ancient gneisses . They 're called archeozoic . They are Pre-Cambrian , the oldest geologic age . Late in that age the central area of the Labrador peninsula was depressed and filled by the sea . In this Labrador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proterozoic age . And one of these sediments is iron formation , containing 30 per cent iron . Then the land rose from the sea again and there was a terrific force from the northeast and it compressed and buckled the formation . This gives us the series of high corrugated ridges we have today . The iron ore occurs as a concentration of the iron formation . And that , " he said , smiling , " is enough geology . " This summer Dr. Retty had about a hundred geologists and prospectors at work . Some , like Melihersik , were working out of MAGAZINE Seven Islands ? " our faces 'd be terribly red if someone found an ore pocket along our railroad " ? but most were working out of Knob Lake . " Our main production zone to date is ninety miles long and four to five miles across but the potential ore zone within our concession runs 225 miles long , and thirty miles wide . We have discovered so far 417,707,000 tons of ore . It 's high-grade stuff ? 55 to 60 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of material that 'll run 40 per cent and that can be easily concentrated . Moreover , the silica is low , only 8 or 81/2 per cent , which is a big advantage . And all our discoveries so far resulted from surface outcrops . The possibilities are tremendous . There 's not the slightest doubt they 're going to find a hell of a lot more iron ore . Moreover it 's direct-shipping ore ? you just scoop it out of the ground , put it into railroad cars , and send it to the steel mill . " III T HE Iron Ore Company will build a railroad , two hydroelectric dams , ore docks , and a mining and loading installation at Knob Lake , plus a town adjoining Seven Islands and another at Knob Lake . Sixty per cent of the estimated total cost was for building the railroad ? $120,000,000 . Nobody really knows how much it 'll cost . I took a taxi out from Seven Islands to the base camp of the railroad contractor , a sprawling collection of several dozen low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming loose at the joints , as though the carpenters had been hustled off to another job before they were quite finished . At a desk in a bare little office I found W. E. Ross , the chief engineer , a stocky man with a little mustache and graying hair who handled himself like an athlete . Sharp pencils and a little ruler bristled out of his shirt pocket . CMMMK , he said , was an abbreviation of **39;675;TOOLONG , which was a combination of four construction companies that had undertaken this project jointly . Three were Canadian ; the fourth , Morrison-Knudson , Ross 's corn ? pany , was American . " It is estimated , " Ross said , coming around his desk and going to a long strip of a map thumbtacked to the bare wall , " that there 's about twelve or fifteen million cubic yards of excavation or grading . Rock and earth . Here goes your railroad location , " and he followed it with his pencil . " Twelve miles out of Seven Islands , there 's a tunnel 2,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the tunnel , right there 's the bridge across the Moisie River-800 feet long . There 's no other large bridge , though there are a couple dozen smaller ones , as this railroad follows the natural watercourses , " and he traced them , up the Moisie , then up the Nipissis , then up the Wacouno . " When we get to the head of Wacouno Lake at Mile 150 we 're at the height of land . And from there on we 're going downstream along the Ashuanipi river system . " He gazed at the map , then , rather reluctantly , went back to his desk . Engineers for the Iron Ore Company had spent three years laying out the railroad route ? almost straight south from the ore at Knob Lake to a deep-water harbor at Seven Islands , with gentle grades . In the summer of 1950 the company decided to go ahead with the job . It invited about a dozen contractors to submit bids . " I did some of the figuring for my company myself , " Ross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'd just reported back in from a couple years in Arabia , building highways and airports and all this and that . Well , these four companies decided to form a pool and go after the job . You see , Cartier and McNamara have done many big grading jobs in eastern Canada and Mannix in western Canada . Morrison and Knudson have designed and built a lot of railroads , highways , hydro projects ? one of their jobs was Grand Coulee Dam . There are some of us that have had some railroading experience . Though it 's not easy to get hold of someone with railroad experience , " he said , smiling rather shyly . " No one has built any railroads to speak of for a long time . Well , there were several other bidders . This CMMMK combination was awarded the contract on September 21 , 1950 . " On September 22 we started to assemble our personnel . They came from all over this part of North America . We established an office in Montreal . We got a few pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unloaded it here on the morning of October 2 and went to work . At that time there was nothing here , not a thing , " and he smiled . Railroad Route : Seven Islands to Knob Lake " A bulldozer had about a third of this camp area cleared of brush . And that 's all . We stayed in some hall-finished rooms up over a store in town . Boy , it was rugged , I 'm telling you . Finally we got the base camp out here built . Now we have three bunkhouses here that sleep a hundred men each , two staff quarters for men and two for women , an office building , a kitchen , cafeteria , bake shop , laundry , boiler house to generate steam for heating , our own power plant for electricity , our own water supply and sewage disposal plant , our shops and warehouses , and eighteen family dwellings for our married staff members . We have IBM equipment to do our payroll and accounting work , a four trunkline telephone system , two-way radio communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airports and our office in Montreal . " Last fall too they were buying equipment and materials , 25,000 tons of it . It had to be shipped to Seven Islands from Montreal before navigation closed on the St. Lawrence December first . So did several hundred workingmen . The city pier at Seven Islands was n't big enough so they had to build a new one a mile down the beach . " You see , " Ross said , leaning back in his chair and tapping the edge of his desk with his pencil , " in the past fifty years what new railroads were built , were built parallel to existing highways or other railroads . On this thing the problem is not just one of moving earth and rock ? it 's also a problem of access . Of logistics . Our general plan of operation on the job was this . We 'd build access roads more or less parallel with the railroad line . And we would move our equipment up the line over these access roads so it 'd be there , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the access road ? He smiled . " You go out with a bunch of bulldozers and you start leveling off a road , following the contours . In muskeg you haul in gravel and if the gravel would n't hold you corduroy it ? cut trees and lay the logs crossways . Then you get into blue clay , " and he sighed and meditated for a moment . " There 's a belt of blue clay from Mile 10 to about Mile 30 . Naturally we had to smooth it off too . Well , it 'd freeze over maybe a foot deep , freeze solid enough to hold up a caterpillar . So we 'd step in there one morning and bulldoze off the foot of frozen stuff . We 'd keep going till we got into the unfrozen unstable stuff and had two or three bulldozers stuck . Then we 'd haul ' em out , wait overnight , and in the morning it 'd be frozen another foot deep and we 'd step in and do it again . Sometimes it took six or eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment over . Of course , it 's just a winter road ? when that blue clay thaws out in the spring you ca n't get back over it , even in a jeep , you 'd just go out of sight . " I asked how they expected the blue clay to hold up a railroad if it would n't hold up a jeep . " We 've bailed it out with a dragline and thrown it away , then hauled in rock and other stable material to replace it . We think it 'll stay . " He smiled . " We 'll find out in a year or so . You see , this is all new here ? nobody else has been in here before and we 've got to figure it out as we go along . " When their winter road reached the Moisie River they bridged it with an 800-foot pile trestle . And went on up the route , building camps every twelve or fifteen miles for about forty miles . They moved up some of the men and all the equipment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They hauled in jack hammers and wagon drills and towed in air compressors . In November the men did a little grading near the camps . In January they began blasting the tunnel at Mile 12 ? rock is about as easy to handle in winter as in summer . In January too they jumped ahead to Mile 100 and built a camp at Wacouno ? flew the camp in , flew the equipment in , men , supplies , fuel , everything . And started grading there in May . Already at the other camps along the line the men and food , the equipment and fuel , had been distributed , and they went to work . When the ice went out it took the pile trestle over the Moisie with it , but they already had their equipment across . The men marooned beyond the river had to be supplied by helicopter till the airstrip at Mile 36 was finished . All told , there now are six mainline camps , plus five intermediate tent camps . There probably never will be more ? as one camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the others . Each camp holds 200 or 250 men . The men walk out to the working place if it 's near camp or go by truck or boat if it 's not . About fifty miles of the roadbed is graded . The access road is now at Mile 50 . As the railroad is built , of course , it will in part supplant the access road as an equipment carrier . So far they 've laid track only up to Mile 7 . Laying track is a mass-production operation ? diesel locomotive crane and flatcars carrying rail , ballast cars carrying crushed rock , power-driven wrenches and spikers and tamping equipment . The bottleneck is the tunnel and bridge at Mile 12 . The tunnel is almost finished-35,000 yards of solid rock drilled and dynamited and mucked out . The bridge is started . When I was there , the steel was due to arrive in a week or two and they 'd haul it up on the railroad . Most of the earth-moving equipment is small or medium-sized ? diesel shovels , drag-lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fast heavy equipment is unsuitable here ? too hard to transport , too big to maneuver in the narrow cuts and fills , ill-suited to moving rock or muskeg or blue clay . Most of the equipment is of American origin ? shovels from Chicago and Milwaukee , tractors from Milwaukee and Peoria . Last year even lumber was shipped in because they wanted it fast . Now they 're logging and milling lumber here . They 'll cut half their railroad tics here . They 're using 132-pound rail , the same kind as that used on a Class A mainline . The workmen come mostly from Newfoundland and Quebec . If they stay six months their transportation cost is refunded , " You get the normal amount of sightseers , come in here for the trip and drive a few nails and leave . The only men from the States are about a half-dozen key engineers and superintendents . You could n't get a bunch of characters from the States to come up to a place like this and stick it out . " I asked if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 . Ross would n't guess . Other engineers hope it can be finished and the ore deposits in production in 1953 . Ross said , " Outside of terrain and weather and access it 's just another big rough tough construction job . Let 's go get something to eat . " The cafeteria was a big low-ceilinged room where workmen wearing yellow CMMMK badges were filing past the steam tables . A sign said : No badge No meal Pas de Badge Pas de repas $1.50 a day for meals is deducted from the men 's pay . It costs $3 a day to feed them . The food is good . After eating , Ross introduced me to a middle-aged American named Monty Vernon , and I walked back to the office with him . The Hanna company had borrowed him from the Pennsylvania Railroad , sent him around the United States studying ore docks , then sent him here to design the railroad terminal and docks . Vernon said , " We 're designing a car dumper that 'll dump two one-hundred-ton cars every fifty seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat . It 's all so big . " IV T HREE men came into his office ? J. W. Buford , a youngish Hanna company executive who had just flown in from Cleveland and was going up to Knob Lake tomorrow ; Art Cavanaugh , an older Canadian railroad man traveling with him ; and Hector MacNeil , the Iron Ore Company 's project engineer . I attached myself to them . Buford was about forty , though he looked younger , perhaps because of his blond hair and pink cheeks . His face was bland , almost expressionless . His lips were thin . He wore a hard-textured finely-tailored gray business suit , a bow tie , and a white shirt . His voice was quiet , even , and incisive . His mind worked very fast . He was blunt and outspoken . He worked from 7:00 A. M. till midnight . I never saw him relaxed . He was machinelike . In his looks , talk , and manner he seemed the very embodiment of Modern Management . We got into a car and drove down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive , Buford said , " That 's the first of about fifty mainline locomotives . It 'll take four of those to pull our ore trains . We 're going to run the heaviest trains ever operated consistently in North America . " They had considered building a conveyor belt from Knob Lake to Seven Islands but had concluded a railroad was better . The dock was wooden , built of huge pilings and timbers . Out at its end was a steamship loaded with lumber and railroad cars . The bodies of the railroad cars had been removed from their trucks , or sets of wheels . On the dock stood two derricks , and now one of them , a yellow giant , rumbled slowly forward on caterpillar treads two feet wide and turned and swung its great boom out over the ship and , clanking , lowered its cables , and workmen hooked them around one set of trucks . Slowly the cables tightened , the young man in the cab of the derrick watching with intense concentration as he operated the controls , and gently he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gently swung it over the dock , a dozen workmen standing below but not quite beneath it , their arms half-raised as though in propitiation , and then slowly the derrick man , who had a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth , lowered the truck , the men taking hold of it and guiding it , lowered it , lowered it till it was only an inch above the tracks , and dropped it gently . We drove northward , heading for the tunnel , and the plain began to break into little hills ; birch trees appeared among the spruces and jackpines . We crossed the railroad right of way , a wide straight gash in the trees , then rounded a bend , climbed a steep high hill , and suddenly ahead the country opened up . We were above the gorge of the Maisie River . Nearby was a construction camp : new shiny metal Quonset hut , rough board garages , white tents with wooden frames , empty oil drums . We walked down a muddy pathway along a ledge beside a dropoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two-by-fours , and were standing on a flat rocky ledge high above the river . The river foamed darkly through a deep canyon ; the rock well dropped sheer two hundred feet . Up the crooked canyon the dark wooded hills ran off to the distant mountains . From here , a cableway stretched to the opposite hill , thin high strands of wire rope supporting a chicken wire cage for men to cross in . ( Once it got stuck halfway across . ) The face of the hill here had been blasted away and the tunnel driven through . The gray rock was fractured in smooth sculp tured planes above the tunnel mouth . The tunnel was dark ; a cold wind blew from it . In front of it the rock had been blasted into a flat smooth floor out to the face of the cliff , and drillers were punching a pneumatic drill into the rock , dust from the drill gray on their faces , their teeth bared and clenched and white , their hands and arms shaking , drilling holes to anchor the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the concrete abutment . The steel anchor frames would be hauled in , assembled here , and buried with concrete into the rocks . Overhead the sky was deep blue . MacNeil , turning , pointed up the ragged canyon . " That 's the kind of country you 've got for a hundred miles . " They 'd made the railroad survey largely by canoe . " This is the only tunnel on the whole route , " he added , rather proudly . " We were able to sneak through everywhere else with open cuts . " V EXT morning , with a few hours to spare before leaving for Knob Lake with Buford 's , party , I went round to see Bob Ross , the fur buyer . He was talking in an Indian language to an Indian hunter . The living-room was filled with rich old wood furniture and a piano . On one wall hung a violin . Soon the Indian left , and Ross 's wife , a tall handsome woman with long black hair , came in . Ross , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's moving the Indian reserve nine miles out of town . Getting the Indians out so they wo n't be bothered by the construction riffraff that chase after the squaws . " There were about 750 Indians here . They belonged to the Montagani tribe , a branch of the Cree . " I do n't think there 'll be over twenty of them going back to hunt this year . Up till the boom started there were always at least a hundred . But now they 're making ten dollars a day , laboring or doing canoe work , so why hunt ? An Indian 's a funny fellow . He 'll work a month or two , get money in his pocket , then quit . That fellow that was in here , he 's a good hunter . I used to stake him to $1,000 . He 'd come in with $2,500 worth of fur . And I 'd tell him , Look here , why not save your money and you wo n't always be in debt ? ' He told me , ' If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had money in the bank at Seven Islands , it 'd make death that much harder . ' " The hunt ? that is , furs ? formerly was a bigger industry here than fishing , amounting to $100,000 a season . The Indians caught marten ( sable ) , heaver , mink , muskrat , otter , white and red fox , and weasel . " The whole family goes , you know , " Ross said , " kids , papooses , dogs , and everything . They go out about the twenty-fifth of August and do n't come back till May or June . They go up around Ashuanipi and Menihek and Sawyers , " 180 to 360 miles north . " They used to go entirely by canoe . The last few years we 've been flying them in . I go up and meet them at the end of January . " Once they get in there , they walk . Snowshoe . Pull a toboggan . They do n't establish villages ? each family has its own hunting grounds . There is n't much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they starve . Some lakes have got no fish in them . They can exist on rabbit but they ca n't work on it ? there 's no nourishment in rabbit , they ca n't walk . I remember one year we flew up to a lake west of Menihek and met five families all starving . There was a little kid a year or so old wrapped in a blanket , just skin and bones , his little belly sticking out . The pilot did n't want to bring it out ? we could see it was going to die anyway ? but I thought we ought to , so we took the mother and the baby and another squaw . In the plane she held the baby all the time on her knees , never said a damn word , and as we were flying over Wacouno Lake I saw her look at the baby 's eyes , then hand it to the other squaw . It was dead . After that she just sat and looked out the window . It happens every year . " Ross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . There were seven hundred dogs in town . Now they 're all gone . Theroads are open . And in the bush ? why , now you can fly an airplane in three hours where it used to take you three weeks to travel . At least . If you knock off twenty miles a day in January with a dog team , you 're traveling . You can make sixty or seventy a day in March on the crust . Yes , it 's changing . This iron development has ruined my business . But it does mean that everybody 's got a job , " and he smiled . THE DC3 was ready for the flight north across the wilderness to Knob Lake , and all the passengers except Buford were already aboard . A truck was parked on the runway and the airport manager called , " Can we move this truck a little , Barney ? " I climbed into the plane and sat down next to Cavanaugh . The floor was covered from front to rear with cargo ? mesh sacks and burlap bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartons of canned goods ? all held down with Manila ropes . There were twelve passengers , all dressed like workingmen except Cavanaugh and Monty Vernon . Buford got in , followed by the pilot Scott and the young slim copilot , and in a few minutes we were thrusting forward for the takeoff , climbing steeply above the jagged hills and up through the gray misty sky . Buford had opened his brief case on his lap . He called above the plane 's roar , " Monty , you want to come down here and bring your papers ? " and Monty Vernon clambered over the cargo and sat down beside him and took some documents out of a filing envelope and he and Buford set to work , spreading out their papers on the bags of onions at their feet , Buford 's bright white cuff shooting far out beyond his coat sleeve and showing a gold wristwatch as he stretched to straighten a corner of a blueprint on the onions .                 @ @ @ @
