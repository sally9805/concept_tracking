MELORA 1 " Actually , I have fou  --  nd very sweet children they are , " a softly modulated voice said in impeccable English . The three heads of Representative Janson , Representative Smithfield and Ensign Siegel snapped around like jerked puppets . They stared in horrified disbelief at the source of the remark , which was the girl . Ensign Siegel , looking at the girl , saw some of his quoted guidebook words flash across his mind like the huge illuminated words on the Times Building news ticke  --  HANCROID . . . YAWS . . . GONORRIIEA . An enormous flood of embarrassmentengulfed him . A great speechlessness that seemed as if it could never be broken seized the three Americans . " Madame , " Ensign Siegel finally managed to mumble , and saw a smile in the girl 's eyes at the word , " I am Ensign Siegel of the United States Navy . " Instantly lie realized how ridiculous this sounded . " I gathered you were in the United States Navy . " The girl 's eyes were amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her . " How do you do , " she said politely . " How do you do , " Ensign Siegel heard himself echo . Then he said in weak , stuttering tones , " This is Representative Janson of the United States Congress and Representative Smithfield of the United States Congress ! " " How do you do , " the girl said with flawless manners . " how do , ma'am ! " Representative Smithfield said , jerkily removing his Panama hat . " Pleased to meet you ! " Representative Janson stuttered , removing his Navy hat . In his confusion he dropped the hat . He stooped and scooped it up fumblingly . " It 's a real pleasure to meet you ! " The honors in etiquette were all on the side of the girl , who was the only one at ease . The congressmen hurried into the behaviorthey would have put on on finding out suddenly that she was the daughter of their most influential constituent . " We 're honored to have two members of Congress visit Tanalolo , " the girl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent ? " " New Jersey , " said Representative Janson meekly . " North Carolina , " said Representative Smithfield contritely . The girl smiled pleasantly . " Both sides of the Mason-Dixon line , " she said . " This is an honor . " " Thank you , indeed , " Representative Janson said respectfully . " The honor is all ours , " Representative Smithfield said gallantly . The girl turned easily to Ensign Siegel , who wished he could find some place to go into the ground . " So you speak Tuluran , " she said with polite interest . " An unusual accomplishment for a Navy officer . " " I get around the villages , " Siegel heard himself explaining . This sounded stupid in his ears , so he added , " I like languages . " That , he felt instantly , was no improvement . He had a completelyfrustrating sensation of being unable to be anything but stupid in the presence of this girl . But before he could think of anything further to say , she turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this pleasant conversation , " she said , " but you know how it is when you have four children . You two look as if you 're parents yourselves , " she said in tones of sweet inquiry . " I have three , " Representative Janson said shamefacedly . " I have five , " Representative Smithfield admitted , avoiding her eyes . The girl turned back to Siegel . " I 'm sorry I did n't have my children  --  llfour of the  --  long for you to meet , " she said , her eyes mischievous . " They are such sweet children . " " I 'm sure they must be a constant source of amusement to you , " Ensign Siegel said impassively . " I have enjoyed them very much , " she said . After a quick good-bye in Tuluran to the old man , she was42gone . The two congressmen and Ensign Siegel watched in silence as she walked lithely down the road . " Whew ! " Representative Smithfield sighed . " Where the hell did she come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith College ? " Ensign Siegel turned to the congressmen . " ' Light thunderstormsoccur throughout the year , ' " he said loudly , from a guidebookmemory passage , " ' especially during the summer . The seasonof the most serious storms , typhoons and typhoon-type tropicaldisturbances is from August to December , November being called by the natives IIumalong , " remain-in-the-village time . " At least one damaging storm hits Tulura each year . ' " Ensign Siegel picked up the palm toddy jug from the porch and took a solid slug of it straight from the jug . " Gentlemen , remainin-the-villagetime is over . Let 's get cracking over to that Seabee battalion . " As he shoveled the gentlemen from North Carolina and New Jersey back into the jeep , Ensign Siegel was making rapid mental plans for a solo cruise back to Tanalolo , at flank speed. 2The education of Admiral BoatwrightIn all history there has been perhaps no human project so staggeringly complex as the planning of the average assault operation of the Pacific campaign of World War II . Consider : Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ammunition , chocolate bars , drums of gasoline , cans of peaches , C-rations , tubes of toothpaste , pairs of socks and underwear , traveling thousands of different routes from origin to final destination , and item , quantity and route all of necessity determinedmonths ahea  --  ach must needs come ashore , at its specific time , on its specific spot on a tiny atoll set in the great ocean wastes . The coordination , sense of detail and foresight required to bring this off called for a wizardry little short of sublime . This job belonged to Vice-Admiral D.D . Boatwright . He was the brains of the Pacific war . It was his genius which largely planned the great island assaults , synchronized a million men and44 45 The education of Admiral Boatwrightbillions of dollars ' worth of materiel to the right spot at the right minute . The Navy had furnished Admiral Boatwright its finest education and it found in him a veritable naval Clausewitz . The Navy had taught Admiral Boatwright just about everything , exceptone thing . Before Pearl Harbor , reporters seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated as identified enemy agents dedicated to filching its innermost secrets . Even for a considerable time after Pearl I ! arbor an admiral might go along for months , having to do nothing but fight the war , and never encounter a reporter . But by the beginning of 1945 the Navy 's attitude had undergonea wondrous change . The Navy , abruptly falling madly in love with the power of the press , had opened the floodgates and reporters were descending like schools of happy barnacles on the Pacific Fleet . While earlier only the wire services and largest newspapershad sent out correspondents , now they came from score upon score of publications and organizations never before represented in a theater of war . War correspondents came from newspapersall over the States , from remote radio stations , from trade magazines , from fraternal publications , true-confession magazines , even from comic magazines . They made for Tulura , where his planning wizardry had brought Admiral Boatwright to one of history'scritical moments and roles . It brought him also into the one situation for which none of his training had prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces , logistics was the inherent problem and Admiral Boatwright 's theme song . His favorite opening word to any sentence was " Logistically . " After a while the word was picked up by correspondents and officers , who would be having a drink at the officers ' club and observe , " Logistically , this is one hell of a fine rum sour , " or be discussing another inherent problem in the Pacific and remark , " Logistically , I could do with a piece of ass . " Admiral Boatwright was a logistics fiend . He hated to see manpower or materiel diverted to any use but winning the wa  --  he basis , no doubt , for his despising the entire Public Relationslash-up , which he considered as essential to the winning of the war as guinea hen under glass . " Logistically , " Admiral Boatwright used to tell his chief , CornFleets , " I recognize the need for something of everything in war , where you 're dealing with a civilian Navy , though I must say we seem to be consuming a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that a wartime Navy floats mainly on Coca-Cola . But I fail to see why we need so many correspondents . What do they all find to write about ? The communique gives all the essential facts . You take this compendium . " Admiral Boatwright would produce a stapled sheaf of eight legal-size , single-spaced pages listing the correspondents attached to ComFleets . He lifted it as though it displaced as much tonnage as the U.S.S. New Jersey . " I-Iere 's a correspondent for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and another correspondent for the Dallas Morning News . Now , those two cities are thirty-two miles apart . Why could n't they go together and have one correspondent write for both ? " His chief smiled patiently . " Boats , you may be a bear at the craft of logistics . But you do n't know the first thing about the craft of journalism . Each paper wants to be able to say it has its own correspondent covering the Pacific . " " Then their saying it is an outrageous luxury for the Navy to indulge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Relations bureaucracy over there ! And the space they take up . Three big buildings ! " Admiral Boatwright said , livid . " As much as Plans , Operations , Intelligence , Communicationsand Logistics combined ! " He pulled from his pocket a fat roster of ComFleets Public Relationspersonnel . " I 've been in the Navy forty years now , and until I arrived on Tulura I had never even heard of the billets they 've got over there . Listen to this ? " And the admiral began to read from the roster : " Media Officer , Magazine Liaison Officer , Radio CorrespondentsLiaison Office  --  here are seven of those , Recording46 47 The education of Admiral BoatwrightOfficer , Research and Historical Officer , Public Relations War Plans Officer , Public Relations Operations Officer , Public RelationsEngineering Officer , Radio Photo Officer , Photo Supply Officer , Fleet Motion Picture Officer , Fleet Still Picture Officer , Motion Picture Training Officer , Motion Picture Planning Officer , Correspondents ' Aides . . . Sweet Jesus ! " Admiral Boatwright exclaimed in rage . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roster . " And what is the purpose of these hordes over there ? Their sole purpose and duty is to pet and pamper the correspondents . The correspondents who themselves with their expendable curiosity take up the valuable time of Navy men who are in the Navy . The last one of those Public Relationsoddballs ought to be out on a shi  --  ost of them chipping paint . And nine-tenths of the correspondents ought to be in uni-form . " " Sh-sh , " ComFleets said . " What you just said is heresy . Boats , you just do n't correctly estimate the great weight of American public opinion . The correspondents determine what the public thinks about us . What the public thinks about us determines our appropriations . Our appropriations determine the size of the Navy . " ComFleets sighed . " They ought to have taught us more about all this at Annapolis in addition to navigation . Maybe it was n't true so much when we were midshipmen . Long time back , was n't it ? But today there are n't too many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure I like it . But then , " lie said wistfully , " there have been a lot of things in my life I have n't like  --  ut have learned to live with . " " I 'll never like it , " Admiral Boatwright said roughly . " Hell , Boats , we 'll just have to glamorize you for the press . Make a character out of you . Why do n't you grow a beard ? Or start wearing your fly open ? " That was the trouble with Admiral Boatwright really . He knew how to launch thousands of ships and hundreds of thousands of men to beat into submission the enemy 's great island fortresses . He took the most complex logistical problems in the annals of warfare and wrenched from them victory after victory . Ile was a genius really . But he had about as much glamor as a stuffed barn owl . He just was n't a character . Reporters at heart resent the absenceof glamor , since that absence threatens their livelihood . Beingresented , Admiral Boatwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Boatwright consented only after a direct order from his chief and then only during the hour of five to six A.M. This was when he took his jungle constitutional , followed at ten paces by an armed Marin  --  his over his objections . He figured if he had to give an interview he would give it when he could n't do anything else anyhow . The first correspondentwho accepted these terms had to go to bed for a week with a heart condition . Clad in Marine fatigues and clodhoppers , and his barrel chest utterly unwinded , Admiral Boatwright set a fierce pace in his walks , singling out the roughest terrain and thickest underbrush to plow through . " Did you ever try to take notes while galloping through a couple of miles of boondocks ? " the correspondent asked a friend from his bed . " The son of a bitch almost killed m  --  ntentionally , I think . " After that journalist 's experience , the requests for interviews with Admiral Boatwright suddenly vanished . The admiral still had to give an occasional press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporters snipe , bait , paw and gnaw him . One correspondentin particular , Gordon Ripwell , hated Boatwright 's guts . " Admiral ? Back in 1943 Bull Halsey informed u  --  was presentwhen he said i  --  hat the Navy would have the Japs licked by Christmas , " Ripwell would begin . Rip never just asked a question . He gave a prologue , made a speech which frequently included passages on naval strategy for the benefit of the naval officer givingthe press conference , then asked a question . Someone once remarked that when Ripwell attended a press conference it was difficult to tell who was being interviewe  --  ipwell or the naval officer who was supposedly giving the conference. 48 49 The education of Admiral Boatwright " That was in 1943 , " Ripwell would say , " that Halsey had the war over by Christmas , and here we si  --  he present year is 1945 . Admiral . Meantime we have had assaults on Tarawa which took 3,286 casualties . On Tulura here which took 2,896 . On Saipan ? a D-day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17,166 . Iwo Jima which took 22,906 American casualties . . . " Ripwell would cite the losses in a tone that suggested that Admiral Boatwright was personally responsible for the murderor maiming of these men . Admiral Boatwright 's face , by this time , would be flushing a pomegranate purple . " I was wondering , Admiral , if there 's to be more and more of this , or if you visualize upcoming Okinawa as the last island assault before we take on the Japanese home islands . " The question was a trap , the important word being " island . " What Ripwell really wanted to know was not whether Okinawa was the last island assault but whether the next strike was going to be at the China mainland or directly at Japan . Admiral Boatwrightsaw this , of course , and he was not the man to fall into a trap where naval matters were concerned . The trouble was , he could barely restrain himself from saying it was a trap . He should have laughed the question off . Instead his blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war to be concluded in 1943 , " he would snap . " Well , sir , " Ripwell would say blandly . " I was only quoting a famous Navy admiral . " " Quoting one of the best , I might add . . . " " Admiral , " Rip would say with elaborate patience , " let us not get into a discussion on the batting averages of the various and numerous admirals . To get back to my question , about Okinawa being the last island before the mainland of Japan ... " " I would say that 's top secret information , " Admiral Boatwright bit out . It was a serious tactical mistake for Admiral Boatwright to say ' that . He would never make such a tactical mistake in a naval problem but he made bloopers with the press . Ripwell laughed smugly . " Ex-cuse me , Admiral . I would n't want to pry loose any of the Navy 's secrets . " It was all Admiral Boatwright could do to keep from blurting out " The hell you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he consistently summoned in his dispatches , " Close-mouthed Navy sources refused ... " In a moment Ripwell would be back potshotting at the admiral . " In the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea , in which some of us here participated , the tiny Seventh Fleet was supporting the landing which the Third Fleet was to protect from attack by sea . " ( Ripwell talking , not the admiral . ) " Those supposedly stupid littleJapanese sailed a decoy fleet from Japan down toward Luzon for the purpose of sucking the Third Fleet up nort  --  which they did . Meantime the main Jap fleet , which had been routed four days after the landings by typical Navy fly-boy exaggeration , and another Jap force converged on the helpless Seventh and sank two carriers , three destroyers and a hundred plane  --  ll because the Third Fleet was chasing clucks up north . A look at the waters around Okinawa " ? Ripwell , while the admiral inwardly boiled , would step forward to the admiral 's map at the front of the room and pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul-up by your Navy ... " Glamor , a minimum of glamor , would have protected Admiral Boatwright from all this . Wearing a baseball cap , like Mitscher , or making wild but thrilling predictions , like Halsey , would have saved him from it . Admiral Boatwright was far too much the sane strategist to indulge in wild predictions . As for baseball caps , he would have looked as foolish in one as Herbert Hoover . But something had to be done to make Admiral Boatwright glamorous , make a character out of him . He was a genius , and if lie was a son of a bitch to the correspondents , he was just about the most vital American son of a bitch in the Pacific . No matter50 51 The education of Admiral BoatwrightIf this kept up , the press would destroy him . Normally it was a job for Public Relations . There were plenty of people in the shop who could have glamorized the admiral into a naval MacArthur if only he 'd put himself in their hands . The hitch was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have been blasted out of his office so hard and high he would n't have descended until he landed on the Japanese home islands via the China mainland . Admiral Boatwright got glamor anyhow . Not consciously , for if he 'd known he was getting glamor he would have fiercely stopped the whole operation . Glamor crept up and seized him by the scruff of the neck , or pants , and by that time there was nothing he could do about it . The operation itself was really very simple . It was at his chief 's insistence that an armed Marine accompaniedAdmiral Boatwright on his jungle forays . There were still a few Japs rustling around the boondocks and ComFleets did not care to have his ace planner picked off , though it was beginning to appear that if the Japs did n't , the press would . Admiral Boatwrightbitterly resented the bodyguard . It was a sordid waste of manpower , in his book , to have one fighting man engaged at doingnothing but protecting another man . Once a month Admiral Boatwright jeeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . One day he was passing through a native village when a small boy coming out of nowhere darted in front of the jeep . The driver slammed on the brakes , inches short of the youngster and almost hurtling Admiral Boatwrightthrough the windshield . The admiral stepped on out anyhowand satisfied himself that the child was unharmed , just scared a little . As he was bending solicitously over the lad , Admiral Boatwright heard him mutter something in Tuluran . Almost simultaneouslyhe felt something seize the seat of his pants . Admiral Boatwright straightened up in disbelief and looked dow  --  quarely into the upturned eyes of a nondescript mutt of a dog which nonetheless appeared capable of staring even a viceadmiraldown if necessary . The odd thing , though , was that the dog was not biting his flesh . Yet he was holding him very immovablyby the seat of his trousers . It was the technique used by a fine retriever which grasps the duck firmly without harming the duck meat . The dog held him fast until the boy , apparently satisfied that the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said something else in Tuluran . Whereupon the dog let go the admiral 's seat . " Well , I 'll be damned ! " Admiral Boatwright said . he was fascinated . " That is some trick . Your dog , sonny ? " The boy , while using Tuluran to the dog , used English for the Navy . " Yes , sir , Captain . " " Admiral ! " the boatswain's-mate driver , who was long since out of the jeep , violently barked a correction . " He 's a vice-admiral ! " " Never mind , Jenkins , " Admiral Boatwright said . The admiral regarded the dog admiringly . ? " Never seen a maneuver like that . Damned if that is n't some-thing ! " At this point a grown Tuluran with a very broad smile approachedand identified himself as the boy 's father . " Some dog your boy has , " the admiral chatted . The man grinned amiably and waited . " Just what did you say to make him , ah . . . " The admiral indicatedhis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little Tuluran said . " In English , " the boy 's father said , " means Seize pants ! ' " The dog , hearing the words , made for the admiral again . The boy quickly spoke two more words : " Argo busso ! " " Means Release pants ! ' " the father said . " Well , I 'll be damned , " the admiral said . " Rudi busso ! " Argo busso ! ' That is some dog ! " " Dog named for old Navy man and discoverer of our island , " the grown Tuluran said . " Magellan ! " " A very interesting name , " the admiral said agreeably. 52 53 The education of Admiral Boatwright " Smart watchdog , " the grown Tuluran said succinctly . At the word " watchdog " Admiral Boatwright got a canny look in his eye , which meant he was overtaken by an idea . It was not greed for the dog . He would never have thought of lifting a boy 's dog in peacetime . But this was war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sell that dog , would you , sonny ? " The little Tuluran hesitated . He may have been overwhelmed by the admiral 's stars . " Would like to have dog , Admiral ? " the big Tuluran answered for him . " Yours . " The Tulurans are a wonderfully tractable people and nowhere more so than in doing favors for the Navy , which has been long with them . " That 's very kind of you , " Admiral Boatwright said . " But I could n't take him from the boy . " " Horseshit , " the man said gently . The admiral looked startled , but the man seemed to consider it only a mild expletive . The Navy has been long with the Tulurans . " For U.S. Navy , which has given us back our island , one dog is little enough . " It was a pretty speech and the admiral wavered . " Besides , " the man said , " the boy has other dog . Have not , Mario ? " the father said more loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy said in a small voice , " Yes , I have another one . Please take him . I would be happy for him to join U.S. Navy . " " Take him ! " the boy 's father said fervently . " Admiral , we want you to have dog ! " " But are you sure . . . " the admiral began . " Oh , yes , " the man shouted . " We proud you take dog . We proud ! " Before long Admiral Boatwright was forced into a position where he could not have refused the dog . At least he later orderedhis conscience to tell him that . Really , they wanted him to have the dog . They were proud such a high-ranking Navy officershould want him . Once he saw his master talking with theman in uniform , the dog proved tractable enough himself , submittinggladly to Admiral Boatwright 's head-scratchings . Admiral Boatwright understood dogs much better than reporters . Back home in Virginia he had a fine Irish setter and he knew just how to scratch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ust behind the ears . Still the admiral hesitated , a little uneasy at the idea of taking a boy 's dog . " Him horseshit good watchdog , " the man said . " Dog caught sixteen Japs in occupation . " " Is that so ? " Admiral Boatwright was much interested . " Hates Japs ! " the man affirmed . " Can smell Jap mile off ! When smells Jap , comes right up and pulls at your pants . " That did it . When the admiral drove out of the village he was accompanied by a dog in the back seat of the jeep . He was happy to be fifty dollars poorer . He had insisted , over genuine protests , on leaving twenty-five dollars with the boy and a like amount with the man . " If that is n't the damndest thing this dog does , Jenkins , " the admiral remarked every few minutes to his boatswain's-mate driver as they drove along . Then he would turn and look as if unable to believe the dog was there . The dog was indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearing the stoic look of a man just inducted into the Navy . The admiral repeated , to himself , " Rudi busso ! " and " Argo busso ! " until he was sure he had thoroughly memorized the commands . The next day Admiral Boatwright held a private demonstration for his chief in ComFleets ' office . At the command " Rudi busso , " Magellan instantly seized ComFleets ' pants . Admiral Boatwright briefed his chief on the dog 's Jap-smelling history and finally persuadedhim that the dog was as ideal protection as he could possibly have . Even a Marine , he pointed out , could n't smell Japs . The Marine , cursing all dogs , was sent back to troops . Admiral Boatwright was happy to have that manpower problem off his conscience. 54 55 The education of Admiral BoatwrightEvery morning between five and six the dog would trail the admiralas he crashed through the boondocks on his constitutional . It was a fine arrangement for three weeks ; then the dog disappeared . It happened as Admiral Boatwright emerged from a section of unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog was no longer with him . He waited a moment , thinking the dog had held back to do some exploring . When he did n't show , the admiral retraced his steps . Ile searched for two hours , shouting , " Oh , Magellan ! " at intervals . It was the only time anyonehad ever known Admiral Boatwright to be late for work . At Headquarters the first thing he did was to send a platoon of Marinesover the route he had gone that morning . The Marine platoon , whose previous experience had been limited to H-hour assaults on Tarawa , Saipan and lwo Jima , failed to turn up a trace of the dog . Admiral Boatwright promptly had a notice mimeographed and distributed by the hundreds all over the island . It began : " Fm : ComFleets . To : All Hands on Tulura . Subject : Dog , Missing . One dog belonging to D.D . Boatwright , Vice-Admiral , USN , has disappeared . Name : Magellan . Color : Reddish-brown and curly . Size : Knee-high . Large ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to direct anyone getting a scent of his whereabouts to report same to the admiral . A week later a Seabee carpenter 's mate showed up at Admiral Boatwright 's office . He had seen a dog answering the description in a native village . That same evening Admiral Boatwright drove over for a look . He took with him the Seabee and also Ensign Max Siegel , who joined the entourage after Boatwright sent a crisp word to the Public Relations Section . " In case you 've got one officer , amongst your legions over there , who can speak any Tuluran , " the admiral 's note went , " send himover . Ilave important mission in Tuluran village this evening . " Though most Tulurans on Tulura spoke at least some American , Admiral Boatwright logistically wanted a Tuluran-speakingofficer along in case the dealings over the dog should get complicated . Lieutenant Commander Nash was enormously gratified to be able to reply in the affirmative to the admiral 's note . Before sendingSiegel to the admiral he briefed him carefully in manners . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to do with Navy-Tuluran relations , " the exec said , " but I want you to be extremely careful every word you say , Siegel , you hear me ? Admiral Boatwright is one of the greatest crosses we in Public Relations have to bear . He 's utterly unpublic-relationsminded . One of those old-fashioned naval types , fast disappearing , thank the Lord , who thinks a Navy is merely a collection of ships . " " A remarkably provincial attitude , " Ensign Siegel said soberly . " Is n't it ? " the exec said . " Now , for heaven 's sake do n't sayanything to ruffle him . Try to be a credit to Public Relations . " " I 'll do my best , Commander , " Ensign Siegel said . " You better , " the exec warned . " And if you see an opening , get in a word on how important we are here . Something that will impresshim . " " I 'm sure that would , " Ensign Siegel said gravely . A couple of hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the dog Magellan had allegedly been sighted , the admiral riding in the front of the jeep with the boatswain's-mate driver , Siegel , who had now been briefed on the mission , and the Seabee in back . As they drove along , Siegel reflected how anywhere in the Navy but here it would be unheard of that an ensign should have any dealings with an admiral , or even get within twenty feet of one . It was a measure of his rapid adjustment to the Tulura scheme of things that he felt no self-consciousness whatsoever about jeeping along with three stars . Indeed , Siegel found himself charmed from the first word by the admiral . " You 're one of those Public Relations oddballs , are n't you ? " was the first word. 56 57 The education of Admiral Boatwright " Yes , sir , " Siegel said . " What a collection of freaks , " the admiral said . " Yes , sir , " Ensign Siegel said . " They 've got everything but the bearded lady , " the admiral said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " Siegel said . " She represents a chain of Texas newspapers . " " My God ! " the admiral said . " Is there one newspaper in Texas which does n't have somebody out here ? " " The Navy has been able to dig up one , I think , sir , " Siegel said . " A paper in Whitesboro , Texas . But I think the Whitesboro County Clarion man is due out here next week . " " My God , " the admiral said . " Sometimes I get the damndest feeling . It 's that we 're fighting the war not to lick the Japs but to provide fodder for those multitudes of typewriter mechanics over there . What an outrageous logistic waste that booby-hatch is ! " The admiral , turning in his seat , looked hard at Ensign Siegel . " I do n't see how any self-respecting naval officer can stay there , " he said . " Yes , sir , " Ensign Siegel said . " But of course I hardly consider a Public Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freak , " the admiral said frankly , looking at Siegel . " Yes , sir , " Ensign Siegel said . " Oddballs and freaks , " the admiral repeated . Abruptly the admiral turned almost entirely around in his seat and leaned over the back of it , facing the ensign . A crafty look came over his face . " Just between you and me , " he said , " I 've got a plan cooked up . Next island we invade I 'm going to put all the correspondents on one ship and all those Public Relations legions over there on another . Then I 'm going to issue secret orders to the skipper that will steer the two ships into Tokyo Bay , where the Japs will capturethem both and be obliged to take care of all the correspondentsand Public Relations oddballs and freaks for the rest of the war . It 'll drive the Japs nuts , free our hands to fight the war and get the war over a year earlier . How about that , son ? " The admiral spoke with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure whether he was joking or not . Siegel was almost sorry when presently , following the Seabee 's directions , they were driving into a Tuluran village . The admiral directed his driver to pull up . " Same village all right , " the admiral estimated the situation . " Looks like you did it , lad , " he said to the Seabee . " If this means I get that dog of mine back , " he said possessively , " it 'll be another Seabee first ' as far as I 'm concerned . Now , " he said to the Seabee , " I think you and Jenkins better just wait here . We do n't want to frighten them by too many forces . Son , " he said to Siegel , " you come along with me . " The admiral and Siegel climbed out , and with the admiral settinga brisk pace , started walking down the dirt-road main street of the village . It was one of the few villages on the island Siegel had n't been in before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of the thatched houses in the approachingdusk . Surprised , they returned the greetings in friendly manner . Toward the end of the street Admiral Boatwright , who had been sighting keenly along it all the while , spoke quietly to Siegel . " Ali , " he said , " there the boy is . " The boy was sitting on the step of a hut chewing on a piece of palm heart and looking happy . As Admiral Boatwright approachedand the boy recognized him , his happiness changed to alarm . " Rudi busso ! " the boy suddenly shouted . Out of nowhere Admiral Boatwright felt a familiar grasp on the rear of his pants . He turned and looked down . The dog looked up and caught the admiral 's eye . He looked sheepish , like a man caught AWOL . But he did n't let go . " Well , so he came back , " said the admiral . " Is n't that a remarkablefeat , son , " he said to Siegel. 58 " I 've never seen anything quite like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog holding securely to the admiral 's pants . Suddenly a grown Tuluran came running out of the hut and Admiral Boatwright recognized the boy 's father . " Admiral ! " The grown Tuluran was almost overcome by the vision of a personal visit to his hut by a U.S. Navy admiral . " Sorry , Admiral , sir . . . the dog , he come back . He miss the boy . " The grown Tuluran waited , then added , " And the boy miss him . .. " " But your boy 's other dog . . . " the Admiral said . The man bowed his head . " No other dog , Admiral . We were trying . . . But you take dog . You take dog back . Please ! " " I would n't think of it . You should never have let me take him . " " I guess dog prefer civilian life , " the man said , and lest he be misunderstood , hastily added , " No reflection on horseshit U.S. Navy ! " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the admiralsaid to Siegel . " They like being friends , sir , " Ensign Siegel said . The admiral cleared his throat . " It was my fault , " he said to the father . " I should never have taken the dog . " " Not Admiral 's fault , Admiral , sir , " said the man , who had grown up surrounded by the Navy . " Admirals , they do n't make faults . " Admiral Boatwright 's lips were creased by a sad smile . " Admirals make faults , too , " he said . " Lad , " Admiral Boatwrightaddressed the little Tuluran , " if you 'll have your friendrelease me , I 'll be going . " In his excitement over the visit of a U.S. Navy admiral to his but the father had not noticed that his son 's dog was still holding the admiral fast . " Mario ! " he said in some alarm . " Tell dog let go Admiral 's pants . " " Magellan stay ? " the boy said uncertainly. 59 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sonny , Magellan stay . " " You sure , Captain , " the boy said uncertainly . " Mario , " the grown Tuluran corrected . " The Admiral 's an ad-miral ! " " Never mind the rank , " Admiral Boatwright , who was now really anxious to be gone , said , " just get me loose , son . " He directedSiegel , " Tell them I really would be , well , unhappy now with the dog . " Siegel explained the admiral 's position in Tuluran to the boy 's father , who , enormously pleased to hear a U.S. naval officer speak his language , promptly began to launch into all sorts of conversationalmatters having nothing to do with the dog . " Son , " the admiral cut in crisply after a few minutes , " how 's for cutting the jabber and getting me loose ? " Ensign Siegel , equally engrossed in talking with the grown Tuluran , came out of it suddenly to realize the dog still was in possession of the admiral . Quickly he spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog was his to keep . " Argo busso ! " the boy at last said , and the admiral was free again . The dog whimpered a little and rubbed against the boy 's leg . Admiral Boatwright hitched up his pants , which were somewhatdrooping now . He patted the little Tuluran on the head . He shook hands with the grown Tuluran , who tried to give back the fifty dollars , which the admiral declined . Then the admiral reached down and for a moment scratched the dog behind the ears . Quickly he turned and walked down the village street , trailed by Siegel , got into his jeep and drove off . Next day the Marine , happily snatched from impending glory on Okinawa , had back his old job of walking ten paces behind Admiral Boatwright through the boondocks . That was all there was to the dog incident , a very trivial thing . Admiral Boatwright , immersed in planning the Okinawa assault , promptly forgot the whole matter . Indeed , no one would ever have known about it had not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6o 6i The education of Admiral BoatwrightFor months he had been trying to peddle to his editors a piece on Admiral D.D . Boatwright , the great master logistician . The unfeelingbastards in New York , with no notion in their big fat Madison Avenue foxholes of just what it meant to be the great logistician of the Pacific , probably not knowing what the word meant , and no appreciation of the fact this man was going to be famous in history or would be if they just ran a piece on him and paid the correspondent $i , 000 for it , kept firing back : " Subject completely lacking in human interest . " The correspondent had worked damn hard on the piece and besides he needed a sale pretty badly just then . A dog ! By God , a dog had human interest if a vice-admiral did n't . He decided to track down what was behind the mimeographed notice Boatwrighthad composed when the dog was lost . He wanted some answers to certain questions in his mind , such as , " Where did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Tuluran boy ! he discovered . By God , there was human interest for you . A dog ! A boy ! And a vice-admiral of the U.S. Navy . Even the bastards in New York would have to admit that was a gold mine of human interest . The bastards did , and soon the correspondent 's entirely fresh treatment of his Boatwright piece , bursting with human or at least dog interest , was on the stands in the United States . About the time the article was out , the wire services and newspaper correspondentsalso picked up the incident and filed stories . When the clippings arrived from stateside , Captain Jarvis , the head of the Public Relations Section , shuddered through them and packed the whole batch over to ComFleets . He would not have dared send them to Admiral Boatwright , and it was with some fear and trembling that he sent them to ComFleets . ComFleets could n't have been more pleased . With mounting pleasure he read and reread the clippings . Then he sent for AdmiralBoatwright . His friend took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily for several moments . Somberly he fingered the clippings . " We have here some newspaper clippings from the States , " he said sternly , " concerning a recent operation on Tulura . " " What are those typewriter mechanics up to now ? " Admiral Boatwright said . " Now and then , " said ComFleets , " the thought crosses my mind that you are not wholeheartedly public-relations-minded . " Admiral Boatwright , who had known ComFleets since they were midshipmen together at Annapolis , grunted . " While I had wind of some parts of this operation , " said CornFleetssoberly , " I regret that you did n't see fit to cut me in all the way . " " What 's that ? " Admiral Boatwright said , frowning . " You know I fill you in on everything . " " This logistics operation involved , " said ComFleets , holding up a clipping , " the return of a dog . " The eyebrows of Admiral Boatwright arched a suspicious fraction of an inch . " There appear to be approximately as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , studying one intently , " but I presume they all have in mind the same operation . At least they 're all about the same admiral . " ComFleets commenced going through the clippings , picking out sentences at random and reading them off as matter-of-factly as ships ' tonnage reports . " According to the Chicago Daily News : If a popularity contest were held today by the Tuluran children , the prize would be won hands down by a tough old vice-admiral of the U.S. Nav  --  . D. Boatwright . ' " The Los Angeles Times reports : The admiral had become very attached to the dog when news reached him that the little Tuluranboy from whom he had bought him was wasting away from grief at his loss . Unhesitatingly the admiral rushed the dog to the boy 's bedside , where there took place a joyous scene of reunion . ' " According to the Atlanta Constitution : One reliable Navy source revealed today that the admiral is planning to adopt the62 63 The education of Admiral BoatwrightTuluran boy . " That way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy and the dog . " ' " The New Orleans Times Picayune feels : The incident proved that a man can be simultaneously a vice-admiral and a human being . ' " And the American Magazine : Up and down Tulura this bluff , crusty Clausewitz of the Pacific is now known affectionately as ? ' " ComFleets raised his eyes from the clipping , and looking quietly at his old friend , said in reverential tones , " Bow-Wow Boatwright ! ' At the phrase , Admiral Boatwright , who had sat stunned and disbelieving during the recital , leaped forward and seized the clippings . As he swept through them the disbelief was chased away by a purple fury . " The human admiral ! " Child wasting away from grief ! " Going to adopt the child ! ' " His mouth seized onto the phrases as he riffled through the clippings and flung them to the floor . " ' An admiral secretly nuts about Tuluran boy  --  nd dogs . ' " ComFleets grabbed up a couple of clippings and began reciting phrases himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ' ? it sounds as if you were the founder and guiding spirit of the SPCA . Admiral takes time off from busy war ' ? oh , my , busy war ' ? ' to return dog to Tuluran child . ' Wow ! Bow-Wow ! " And ComFlects collapsed into his chair in helpless laughter . " Slop ! " Admiral Boatwright let out an infuriated bellow . " This is the mushiest pack of slop , fabrications , distortions , exaggerationsand outright lies in the history of the American Navy ! I 'll confine them to their quarters ! I 'll break them ! I 'll court-martial them ! I 'll ship the last one of them back to the States ... " ComFleets pulled himself up in his chair and wiped the tears from his eyes . " Boats , ca n't you see ? You 're famous . A hundred and fifty million Americans suddenly know all about you . Not anything about your Navy career , naturally . But they know you 're daffy about dogs and kids . Just like you were human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth ground audibly against each other . His white-knuckled fists seized the clippings one by one and wadded them . " They 're trying to make a fool of me . These goddamn correspondentshave it in for me . " " Fool ? " ComFleets exclaimed . " They 've made a hero out of you ! More so than if you 'd sunk the entire Jap fleet with a single PT boat ! Boats , you 're in ! You 've got glamor ! You 're a character ! You 're the human admiral . " Suddenly Admiral Boatwright 's fingers , which were squeezed around a clipping , relaxed ; the clipping fell gently to the floor . His taut frame unloosened until it rested back in the chair . His face colored down from deep purple to its normal ruddiness and he rubbed his hand across it . He gave a mirthless laugh . " So that 's the way it 's done , is it ? Tha  --  mean , translating it quickly , that 's how you get the kind of Navy you want . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several seconds . Then his own features slowly lighted up in triumph . " Boats , " he said , " you have just discovered the greatest logistics secret of your career . " A couple nights later the officers ' club was startled to see AdmiralBoatwright walk in , amiably greet several correspondents standing at the bar , order a drink and spend a tactical quarterhour , no longer , chatting with them . Three days after that Admiral Boatwright dropped over to the correspondents ' room in the Public Relations building , sat down a few minutes and breezed about nothing with some of the reporters . Not until his next press conference soon thereafter , however , did the correspondents believe it . " Bow-Wow , " a correspondent asked the admiral , " what is yourestimate of the length of time it will require to take Okinawa ? " No one laughed . It was the first time Admiral Boatwright hadbeen addressed as anything but Admiral . A death-quietness held64the room , and a terrible tension as the correspondents waited . Admiral Boatwright fixed his questioner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a good question , Jack . I would. say .. .

From being a complete unknown to the U.S. public , Bow-Wow Boatwright thereafter steadily remainedone of the most widel  --  nd favorabl  --  ublicized admiralsin the Pacific Ocean . Logistically , everyone agreed , it was a very fortunate thing , for the Navy really needed Vice-Admiral Boatwright. 1ilelor ? 2NEVER MIND THE FRANGIPANI " Who is she ? " Ensign Siegel said . It was the first day , so snowed had Siegel been with VIP 's , that he had been able to get back to the village of Tanalolo since taking Congressmen Janson and Smithfield there a week ago . " Who is who ? " Mr. Seguro said . " Just a moment . " The old man disappeared inside the house and was back presentlywith an unopened jug of palm toddy . Iie uncorked it and passed the jug to Siegel . " Try this , " he said . Ensign Siegel took a swig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , passing the jug back to the old man .

" Mr. Seguro said . " Last week when I brought the two congressmen here , " Ensign Siegel said . " The two congressmen ? " the old man said . " Yes , that girl we were talking to right here , " Ensign Siegel said , a little impatiently . " That girl you were talking to ? " the old man said . " What girl were you talking to ? " " That 's what I want to know , " Ensign Siegel said impatiently . He turned to the old man . " Now , Mr. Seguro , " he said very66 67 MELORA 2slowly .

" " Yes , " Ensign Siegel said shortly . " Congressmen are pretty importantpeople . " " They all wear costumes like that ? " the old man said . " Sometimes , " Ensign Siegel said , trying to hold his temper . " Now who was she , Mr. Seguro ? " " Who 's that ? " the old man said . " The girl , for heaven 's sake , " Ensign Siegel burst out . " That girl who came down the road . " " The girl that came down the road ? " the old man said . " Which girl would that have been , En-sine ? " " There were n't six or seven of them , Mr. Seguro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ensign Siegel said , his lips taut . Siegel drank off three long gurgles . " Now , Mr. Seguro , " he said , " who was that girl that came down the road while you and I and the congressmen were standingright here talking and then she stopped and you and the girl talked and then the congressmen and I talked to her . " " Oh-h-h , " the old man said , his eyes lighting up in comprehension . " Why did n't you say so ? Why , you must mean Melora . " Ensign Siegel took a deep breath . " Now , who is Melora ? " " Who is she ? " the old man said . " Why , she 's a Tuluran girl . " Ensign Siegel 's hands clenched . He clasped them restrictivelyon his lap . " I gathered that , " he said very softly , with great effort . " I did n't think she came from Australia . " " Well , you 're wrong about that , " the old man said reprovingly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siegel 's eyes glared at the old man . " My , what a lovely day , " the old man said , sighing contentedly . " The frangipani are in bloom . " " Never mind the frangipani , " Ensign Siegel said curtly , finding it very difficult to remember that he had always been attracted by the Tuluran refusal to be hurried . " Now , what 's this thing about Australia ? " " Just that you were completely wrong about Melora not comingfrom Australia , " the old man said righteously . " All right , I was wrong , Mr. Seguro , " Siegel made his confession . " I did n't mean to contradict you . " " You see I know the facts , " the old man said pontifically , " and you do n't . " " That 's certainly the truth , " Ensign Siegel said , sighing heavily . They drank for three or four minutes without saying a word . " Those frangipani certainly are lovely , " Ensign Siegel saidfinally . " Frangipani ? " the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Melora . " Ensign Siegel felt unable to speak . IIe took a slug of palm toddy . Suddenly the old man began to rattle off information . " Melora was in Australia about a month ago on her way back to Tulura . She had been away from Tulura for about four years and we were all very happy to see her back . She had been in Europe , " the old man stated matter-of-factly , " for four years . " " Europe ! " Siegel exclaimed . " Europe is over beyond China , " the old man explained to the ensign . " What in the world was she doing in Europe ? " Siegel asked . " Why she was going to school , of course , " the old man said , a little disgusted at the stupidity of the question . " Madri  --  hat 's in Spain , " the old man said , educationally . " How 'd she happen to get to go to school there ? " Siegel said. 68 69 MELORA 2 " Get to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , she could n't go any place else . She 's an Alba . All the Albas go to school in Spain . " " Who are the Albas ? " Siegel asked . The old man looked incredulously at the ensign . " You mean you do n't know who the Albas are ? " " Well , I have n't been here very long , Mr. Seguro , " Siegel said apologetically . The old man shook his head . " Just the same you should have heard of the Albas . They 're the most important family on Tulura . Any time anybody 's in trouble they go to the Albas and the Albas take care of it . Yes , sir ! They trace their ancestry to Admiral Ruiz de Mendoza . " " Oh , I 've heard of him , " Ensign Siegel said . " What a lovely day , " Mr. Seguro said . " The sweet acacia should be out any day now . " " Now , about Melora , " Ensign Siegel said , hurriedly bringing the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , where does she live ? " " Two miles out in the country , " the old man said . He eyed the ensign critically . " What do you want to know that for ? " " Why , I just thought I might call on her , " Ensign Siegel said . " I would n't waste my time if I were you , " the old man said . " They would n't let you in the door . They 're an old family and very particular . " " But I am an officer of the United States Navy , " Ensign Siegel said . " Does n't mean a thing , " the old man dismissed this . " Her people are the highest type of family . She was educated in Europe , remember . " " Yes , I remember that , " Ensign Siegel said . For a few moments they sat there . Finally Ensign Siegel said , " Mr. Seguro , I really would like to see her again . " The old man turned and looked at the ensign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to be seeking a way , in spite of what he obviously considered the monstrous obstacles . " You were n't educated in Europe , were you ? " he tried . " No , I 'm afraid not , " Ensign Siegel admitted . " But I did go to a pretty well-known American school . Harvard . " " Hair-yard ? " the old man said . " Never heard of it , " he said , as if he were an authority on the better schools . " Maybe you could ask the Albas if they have , " Ensign Siegel suggested . " Doubt if they have , " the old man dashed this idea . " I once heard Mr. Alba say Americans are very nice people but there 's not a chance in the world of being educated there . You learn Tuluran at Hair-yard ? " the old man sought a way out . " No , they do n't teach it there , " Ensign Siegel said . " I learned it right here . " " Must not be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the old man said . The ensign and the Tuluran had some more palm toddy , and sat thoughtfully . Finally the old man sighed and shook his head hopelessly . " No , I 'm afraid there 's nothing we can do . Mr. Alba would be very angry with me if I introduced you to Melora . " The old man sighed again . " Ah , that Melora , " he said . " She is such a smart girl . So much up here , " the old man said , tapping his head . " She does so much for our children . She wants them all to be very smart . She wants them to learn everything . " " Your children ? " Ensign Siegel said quizzically . " Why is she so interested in the children ? " " Why is she so interested ? " Mr. Seguro said , in astonishment at such a stupid question . " What 's so strange about the schoolteacher being interested in children ? I do n't know how it is in the YewnitedStates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chi ... " " Schoolteacher ! " Ensign Siegel shouted . " You mean all the time we 've been sitting here she 's been just a block down the road ? " he said , almost beside himself . " Where else would a schoolteacher be , but in the school , " Mr.70Seguro said logically . " I do n't know how it is in Yew-nited States but here ... " " Good-bye , Mr. Seguro ! " Ensign Siegel was halfway down the steps . " Thanks for the palm toddy ! " he shouted back over his shoulder as he headed down the road toward the schoolhouse. 3Thinking bigEnsign Max Siegel and Lieutenant Morey Griffinshared a room on the second floor of BOO ( Bachelor Officer 's Quarters ) 4 , not that there was an MOQ ( Married Officer 's Quar ters ) within 3,000 miles . Both Siegel and Griffin had experienced sea duty , Siegel on destroyers and Griffin on a minesweeper , makingthem almost the only two officers at Public Relations Head quarters who had ventured offshore . They got along well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in common . Ensign Siegel was one of the most relaxed men you could have found in the war . Nearly everyone in the Public Relations Section liked the duty , naturally , but there were three or four itchy young officers who were always trying to get sea duty . None of them had ever heard a shot fired in anger . That was the difference , of course . Max had participated in five combat operations , and in the last one72 73 Thinking bighis destroyer had been torpedoed from under hi  --  combat recordwhich in the Public Relations Section on Tulura was unique . As a Correspondent 's Aide , Max had one of the few fulltime jobs in Public Relations . His job meant going out to the airfield to meet a new correspondent , seeing that the correspondent got a room in the correspondents ' BOO , got fresh sheets and towels , got a mess card , a ship 's service card , a liquor card , sets of khaki shorts and short-sleeved shirts , field shoes , sun helmet and sun glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an orientationtour of the island 's naval installations and Tuluran villages , arranging travel orders for off the island , setting up interviews with admirals and Navy heroes , getting his typewriter fixed if it broke dow  --  n general , ministering to all the correspondent 's needs and requirements . It meant similar things for other civilian visitors to ComFleets Headquarter  --  arties of congressmen , editors and publishers , business wheels , labor chieftains and others who regularlydropped in to check up on the war . Each of these parties was accorded the VIP treatment , which appropriately varied , however , according to rank . Ordinary congressmen , for example , were met by , in addition to a Correspondent'sAide , a captain and a station wagon and given corner rooms in the VIP BOO , while a congressman who happened to be a member of the Naval Affairs Committee was met by flag rank and a Buick and put up in the guest room in the cottage of ComFleets . When Tulura was alerted that the chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee was en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second Coming , and indeed the code word for this visitor was " God . " " ETA for God is 1400 , " a report might go , or a planning conference might raise the point of who should be invited to the cocktail party the admiral was throwing for God . Max was not a man to be overawed by senators and representatives . Before a tour he would pull his jeep up in front of the VIP BOO , stride inside and bellow down the corridor : " All membersof Congress ! Front and center ! " Congressmen 's faces , startled and angry at this cavalier method of addressing the nation 's lawmakers , would pop out of doors . Then Max would erase the expressions and have the congressmen bursting from their rooms by booming : " Pictures ! " As they clustered voraciously around him , he would pull the iixi4 blow-ups one by one from a large envelope and pass them out . " You , Congressman Jones , astride a submarine ! You , Congressman Brown , morale-building our boys at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boatwright the word on naval strategy ! " The congressmen would be so carried away by the pictures , which made the best kind of campaign material back home , that they would n't be paying too much attention to Max 's comments as he distributed the pictures . " Of course , this service means a new shipment of film will be needed . Another ship tied up on nonessentials ! But nothing 's too good for our constituents . Right , men ? Gentlemen ! The admiral is waiting to mesmerize you ! Let us not hold up the war by too lengthy narcissistic looking at pictures ! " Before they knew what had hit them , Max would have the congressmen in a jeep and buzzing up the hill to a briefing by the admiral , getting them in a good mood on the way by telling them some joke , such as the one about the two admirals asking each other what was the most embarrassing moment in their life . Or if he felt he 'd gone rather far and they were starting off on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other matters by issuingsteel helmets to all the congressmen with the word , spoken in the tones of someone reading off a casualty list : " Gentlemen , I do n't want unduly to alarm you , but we 'll be driving through a boondocks area where several dangerous Japs have been flushed lately . Only last week three men were killed and their bodies mutilatedin an ambush on the road we 'll be taking . " Tulura was safer than Park Avenue on a Sunday afternoon , but Max was able to communicate to the congressmen on a sightseeing tour the feeling that they were practically in a forward Marine platoon. 74 75 Thinking big " That vicarious sense of fear is good for them , " Max used to say . " They take home at least a little of what it is to be scared by a Jap in the bushes . " The main thing the congressmen wanted to see , however , was neither the bushes nor the war efforts nor the admirals nor the Tulurans . What they wanted to see was represented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is anybody here from West Virginia ? " Most of all they wanted to see men from their own states or districts , voting age or no  --  n eighteen-year-oldmight have fifty registered relatives at home and might drop a line mentioning how Congressman White had dropped in to see him . The Seabees were notoriously the most versatile organizationin the war and they proved it nowhere better than here . Tented on a hill about four miles from Ileadquarters was a Seabee battalion which Max made a regular stop for any visiting congressman . Max would have found out long ahead of time , from a copy of the Congressional Directory he had sent off for , which district in which state the congressman represented . Ile had also sent off for those W.P.A. state guidebooks which describe in such detail the population , industry , history and the like of all the towns and villages in a state . A few days before the congressman arrived , Max would jeep over to the Seabee battalion . He would appoint a half-dozen men to be residents of various towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men scripts excerpted from the guidebook , setting forth pertinent facts about their respective towns . The day before the congressman 's visit , Max would return and hold a dress rehearsal , quizzing each man on facts about his assigned home town and even suggesting regional accents . If it was a senator , he would have a dozen men lined up . Congressmen and senators were overwhelmed to find this gold mine of voters from their districtsor states and , thanks to Max Siegel , came away from their visit to Tulura with a very warm feeling . One Seabee , a shipfitter second class , had a record of having been from fourteen statesand nineteen congressional districts . It was no idle boast , that famous Seabee motto : " Can do ! " Max Siegel was very popular with both officers and enlisted men , as anyone who can make people laugh is likely to be popular . If the enlisted men genuinely disliked to stand with him the allnightPublic Relations watch that rotated once a month among the junior officers , it was n't that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastly entertaining besides having absolutely no sense of caste . What they hated was having to wake him in the morning . The Junior O.O.D. came on at 2000 and turned in at midnight on a cot in the Media Section downstairs . The enlisted man on watch stayed awake to summon him in case of an air raid or a correspondent wanting something , and to awaken him anyhow at 0700 . Max was a dangerous man to awaken , his huge body smashing about and rumbling threateningly when anyone tried it . It always took at least ten minutes to do it , and the contortionson his face , Max being an almost spectacularly ugly man , were a chilling sight in the eerie dawn and the empty building , besides which the enlisted man had to be very agile to avoid a bruised arm or bloodied nose . It was somewhat like entering a cage and shaking awake a sleeping gorilla , though the instant he got really awake Max was as friendly as a beagle pup . One night a month Max Siegel drank two bottles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers drew their takehomeliquor rations , consisting of the two bottles of whiskey ? choice of Four Roses or Paul Jone  --  nd their choice of a bottle of either burgundy or sherry . This was in addition to the drinks at the officers ' club , where all month long you could have all you wanted at the bar , at five cents a drink . Most of the officers spread their three bottles over the thirty days for room-drinking . But Max Siegel would start drinking in his room about seven o'clock on the night of ration day and by early in the morning would have drained the three fifths . He showed almost no effects from the first bottle , which he would have finished by around ten76 77 Thinking bigo'clock . Even the second bottle of Four Roses or Paul Jones would produce little noticeable change in him . He would kill that one by midnight . Not until he started on the burgundy , which he always chose instead of sherry , would he begin to get looped . Sometimes , when the liquor and burgundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few shots of palm toddy . Max 's room would be open to all corners that night and a large number of officers would drop by , to gaze in awe at Max 's drinking and to listen to Max hold forth on subjects ranging from the symbolicmeaning of the stock exchange , based on his six months in his uncle 's brokerage firm before going in the Navy , to the emotional complexion of the Tulurans , to the future of Public Relations in the military services . He foresaw the day when there would be one Public Relations officer for each combat man in the Navy , and the fleet commanded by the president of the AssociatedPress , with a six-star rank of Admiral-Admiral , who would decide on operations solely on the basis of their news value , with transmission ships occupied by nothing but correspondents , with no operational dispatches being permitted until the fleet was wiped out to provide a good news item . Siegel considered his Navy work fascinating , if unusual from a naval point of view . The job of Correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve as everything from bellhop to nursemaid for a crew of individualistic , often highly temperamentalcivilians . Some of the Public Relations officers actually came to hate all correspondents with that bitter , unreasoning hatred which the civilian recently put in uniform can have for the ununiformedcivilian who begins to make demands on him and who sometimes even makes ugly allusions that if he were put on a ship he would run it aground in five minutes . The job never got on Max 's nerves . He considered the correspondents interestingspecimens . Lieutenant Morey Griffin had been a rewrite man on a San Francisco newspaper before the war . In contrast to Siegel , he was the idlest man on Tulura , which is saying plenty . He workedin the Media Section , which meant his job was to get out press releases and scare up naval heroes for the correspondents to interview . But there were so many other officers in the same section doing these things , that the available press release and hero materialwas greatly outnumbered by the Public Relations officers available to handle it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he led a life almost totally devoid of labor of any kind . Every morning he got out of bed at eight forty-five , just in time to get to the chow hall , a couple of hundred yards away , at eight fifty-five , five minutes before the hall closed admissionsfor breakfast . Once in , an officer could take as long as he liked . Finishing his breakfast at about ten o'clock , Griffin then returned to his BOO room , shaved and showered leisurely , then walked up the hill to the Public Relations Headquarter  --  itching a jeep ride , if he could , for the distance of about three city blocks . Stopping in the correspondents ' room he gathered up the latest newspapers from the States , which the Public Relations Section subscribed to by the dozen , and either read them there or carried a batch through the swinging door to the adjoining Media room and read them at his desk . This easily filled his time until noon . At twelve Morey rose from his desk and with some of the other officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped by his BOO room first and mixed a prelunch cocktail from his monthly ration  --  he officers ' bar did not open until five o'clock , a time schedule Morey was constantly complaining about . Finishingchow between one and one thirty he returned to his room , took off his clothes and sacked out until about three thirty . Then lie dressed and dropped by the Fleet Library and checked out his daily mystery , went back up to his office and read or breezed with the correspondents for another hour . At four thirty he returned to his room , took another shower , and promptly at five o'clock appeared at the bar , where he was always the first officer in78 79 Thinking bigEven on Tulura , Ensign Siegel was amazed at this perfection of idleness . " Of course no one here puts in a full day 's work , " Siegel occasionallymentioned to his roommate . " But it 's pretty remarkable , Griffin , how an officer of the Navy can get b  --  t least in time of wa  --  ith doing nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got plenty of help up there without me , " Griffin said . " I 'm sacking out for the duration . If they need me , they can come wake me up . " Morey did have one remaining wartime ambition , which was to get assigned to Sydney , Australia , as United States Navy Public Relationsliaison officer to Ilis Majesty 's Royal Navy . No such billet even existed at present . " Why , we 're practically snubbing our chief all  --  he British people , " Morey often pointed out . " I mean , the British having a liaison officer here and us not having the common decency to reciprocate . Why , it 's practically a slap in the face . The Badger , I might say , agreed a hundred per cent with me when I pointed out the situation to him the other day . That 's off-the-record . The Badger ca n't be put in a position of criticizing British-American relations . " The Badger was Lieutenant Commander O.S.B. Badgett , RNVR , His Majesty 's Public Relations liaison officer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those magnificent beards that only members of His Majesty 's Navy seemed capable of raising . " Nonreciprocation is a hell of a way to treat your allies , " Griffin said . " But it 's an entirely different situation , " Ensign Siegel once pointed out to Griffin . " We got a lot of British correspondents gassing in and out of here for the Badger to worry about . There are practically no American correspondents with the British fleet . " " That 's a mere technicality , " Morey Griffin said . " It 's the principleof the thing . " Morey Griffin 's concern about British-American relations hadreally originated one night in the officers ' club , when he and Siegel were standing at the bar . Over the rum sours Morey was volleying off a barrage of gripes , of which he always had a plentifulstore despite the resort-like nature of his life . The subjects that night were Morey 's favorite one  --  hat a jerk Lieutenant Commander " Marblehead " Nash was and how life without a woman was twisting his personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't believe that that crossbreed between a stock ticker and a naval dictionary exists ; anyhow , that he 's in that job . Even the Navy personnel system could n't make a mistake like that . It 's sort of like you picked up the papers and read that one of the Jukes boys had been made president of U.S. Steel . " " We really have it rough , do n't we , Griffin ? " Siegel said . " Especiallyyou . " " Long as I 'm here , Chaplain , " Griffin said , " I might as well spit it out . I jes ' do n't think I can stand it one night longer unless I gets meself a piece of arse . Every night I clobber my pillow and cry myself to sleep . Arse ! Ten years of my life for one small tender piece of arse ! " Whoever coined the remark , " You never think about anything but sex , " must have been talking to Morey Griffin . One wall of Griffin 's and Siegel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Griffin had last had sex . A fresh mark went up each day with a hashmark for each fifth day . Morey Griffin could be amusing , but that night Siegel was a little tired from having met four different parties of visitors at the airfield while Griffin was sacking out . I-le wanted to forget about Nash , and talking about women , he felt right then , was n't going to genie them up like Aladdin 's lamp or something . So he was glad when they were joined by a couple of strangers . They were both ensigns , were very blond and handsome , looked about seventeen years ol  --  nd of course wore wings . After a round the fly-boys mentioned that they were fresh from a stopover at Sydney , Australia. deleted lines " The enlisted man ! " the exec burst forth . " The little guy who used to play left guard on the high-school eleven , or jerk sodas down at the corner drug store . The civilian in uniform ! Joe Blow of Kokomo ! " The exec swiveled furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaned intently forward . " What we need , Sailors , is a department consecrated to one visio  --  elling the people at home , mainly the small papers , the bi-weeklies , the weeklies , the little dailies , about their sons , husbandsand fathers , manning the ships and the bases . A Home Town News Department ! A Joe Blow Department ! " " What an exciting idea ! " I-Iereford said . " But tell me , Commande  --  ho'sgoing to give us the raw material for stories about enlisted men ? There are so many of them ! " " A good question ! " the exec said . " But I 've thought of it . I propose that we instigate an entirely new duty aboard each naval vesse  --  home Town News or Joe Blow officer . This officer will feed news about the Joe Blows on his respective ship in to us here . We 'll process it ! Then we 'll forward it back to the respective home-town paper in the States ! " " You mean that there 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up news items about the crew ? " a voice spoke slowly from the second row . It was Lieutenant Morey Griffin . " I do n't know about other ships but there is n't room for another officer on a minesweeper . No place for him to sleep , Commander . " " I 've thought of all that ! " said Nash , with a little irritation . Selecting a paper clip from his three-inch-shell tray , he aimed it for the wastebasket . It missed . " No , we would n't put any more officers aboard . Simply , we would do this : We would direct the commanding officer of each ship to designate one officer in his complement to be the Home Town News officer in addition to his other duties . The gunnery officer , the navigation officer or whatever officer he pleased . We 'd leave that part of it up to the skippe  --  ince he knows his own officers ' qualifications best . " " On a minesweeper , " said Griffin , " those guys are pretty busy with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how they 'd take to having to dig out and write up news items about the crew when they were off watch . " " Nonsense , " said Commander Nash , aiming another paper clip for the wastebaske  --  t hit . " I was out on a ship one  --  he GeneralJohn F. Kay was her nam  --  oyaging from San Francisco to Tulura , " he said , glancing attestingly at his " Golden Dragon " diploma on the wall . " Most of the officers spend most of their time lolling around the wardroom drinking coffee . They have lots of time . " " Anyhow , " said Griffin , " I doubt if most of them know a news item from third base . " " I 'm glad to hear you making these objections , Griffin , " Nash said evenly . He picked up a pencil and began to tap it ominously on his head , the bald sounding board bouncing a staccato , Morsecode-likenoise around the room . It was a noise the officers knew as a sign the exec 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The devil 's advocate , eh , Griffin ? I realize naturally that you do n't have many professional journalists aboard ship . One thing I thought of was to fetch the officers the commanding officers appointedas additional-duty Joe Blow officers into Tulur  --  r even to the State  --  or a special intensive course in journalism . " " That would make the job popular anyhow , " said Griffin . " For a tour of duty at a journalism school in Frisco , the captain would probably appoint himself to the job ... " The exec , yanking Navy Regulations from his desk library , banged it on his desk , the deafening impact effectively cutting Griffin off . " Belay that negative attitude , Griffin ! " he thundered . " Must you always take advantage of the fact that I try not to run too taut a ship here ? Now let 's watch it , or I will start getting taut . I realized that taking an officer off each ship for this journalism course might leave some ships short-officered , even if temporarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do is to mimeograph84 85 Thinking bigup forms and ship them out to the ships . We 'll leave spaces for Name ! Rate ! Home Town ! Age ! Color of Hair and Eyes ! ? so we can work in a little description , a little color for the sake of realistic writin  --  obby ! and the like , and then a big space for News Item ' about the man . All the Joe Blow officer 'll have to do will be to fill in the spaces . You do n't need any journalistic experience just to fill in spaces . We 'll do the rest . Simple , is n't it ? " " It sure is , " Griffin said . " I think the idea sparkles , " said Lieutenant Commander Hereford . " I think the idea is four 0 , Commander , " said Lieutenant Commander Arnold Gladney . " To me it 's anachronistic that though there are more enlisted men than officers out her  --  xcept , of course , in such highly specialized duties as us here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific about officers than enlisted men . That 's a real mathematical anachronism , " he said , puzzled . " Though I see why , " he added brightly . " Civilian correspondents are interested mostly in name  --  fficers , naturally . " " Naturally , " said Nash . " Civilian correspondents have to be concerned about the big picture . That means officers . After all , officers think up and give the commands which make the big picture . This new department would be consecrated to the little picture . The little picture , " he repeated with a small glow , pleased with the phrase . " Now let 's look alive ! " The exec leaned down and opened the right bottom drawer of his desk . Carefully he removed his sextant . Sitting back deep in his chair , he cocked his feet on the desk , and raising the sextant , commenced to aim it around the room . " Sailors , " he said while peering through it , " I 've thrown outthe idea to you . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department . As a general principle , let me say that itmust be one of our finest , most energetic officers . Volunteers ? " No one spoke up . This absence of volunteers arose from thefact , obvious to every officer in the room , that being in charge of the Joe Blow Department would be an onerous job , requiring lots of detail work . It was obvious that it might require six or eight hours ' work a day , and no officer cared to let himself in for this . " I get it , " the exec said presently . " No one wants to blow his own horn , eh ? " He rested his sextant on his lap . " Well , that 's understandabl  --  ven commendable . Modesty is the hallmark of a good officer . However , look at it this way . It 's going to be one of our most creative departments . Therefore , we need a really competent officer for this one . What a challenge ! His beat : the Navy 's fathomless enlisted-men corps ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale by throwing the footlights into the faces of these presently unknown , unsung heroes ! I 'd love to have the job myself if I did n't have to be exec . Your own comman  --  nd , Jupiter , what a command ! Probably end up as one of our biggest departments . " With absorbed concentration the exec examined the ceiling through his sextant for several moments . Still no volunteers spoke up . Then , lowering the sextant , he ranged his eyes over the batteriesof officers , starting with the lieutenant commanders in the first row . " Two and a half stripes , " he said , " are just a shade too much rank for even this important a job . " The exec 's eyes moved on to the second row and came to rest on Lieutenant Woodrow Wilson Shoemaker , chief of the HistoricalSection , a job which consumed perhaps three hours of his day . " Woodrow can not , I 'm afraid , " the exec said , looking intently at Shoemaker , " be spared from his present duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ma  --  fficer , that i  --  mongst us , who has the proper grounding in history necessary to do a proper job of C.O.'ing the Historical Section . No , Woodrow , you need n't volunteer . " Shoemaker , who had never opened his mouth or moved a86 87 Thinking bigmuscle , released an inner sigh . The exec 's eyes moved to the next row and rested on Lieutenant ( jg ) Ross Pendleton , who put in about two hours a day on his Navy job . " Ross , " the exec said with his usual respect for the former radio producer , " unless you have some special interest in the job yoursel  --  ell , to be forthright about it , I 'd really hate to think of trying to handle the radio correspondents without you . " Pendleton laughed with easy condescension . " Clinton , this thing just is n't on my level . I was n't manager of a radio station in Emporia , Kansas . " The exec , resting back in his chair , gazed thoughtfully at the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of him on the wall . " You know , Ross , " he said , " what you just said about Emporia , Kansas , gives me an idea . The officer who heads up this departmentought to be a sort of a Joe Blow himself . Does n't that make sense ? Someone preferably from the great middle belt of America . Someone who was born , bred , and if possible schooled in the guts of Americ  --  he Midwest . Now we 're getting somewhere . Siegel " ? the exec 's eyes suddenly slipped to the last row of officers ? " what about you ? " " I was bred , I believe , in the Midwest , " Ensign Siegel said . " But my folks moved on and I was born in Boston and I went to Harvard . " " I despise the very idea , " the exec said , puckering his lips distastefully , " of putting a Harvardite with a blind spot about the guts of the country bossing a grass-roots show like this . That goes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm eliminated , " said Ensign Christopher Tyson III , who was the best tennis player on Tulura . " Princeton . " " I would n't consider you anyhow , " the exec said , eying Tyson contemptuously . " You 're far too young and inexperience  --  s your handling of the correspondent Gordon Ripwell testifies . Besidesthat , " the exec added , " we 're getting so much rank around here we need a junior ensign just for the odd jobs . " " Christ knows Ripwell has plenty of those , " Tyson said . " That remark is precisely what I mean about your immaturity , " the exec snapped . The exec tried a few other officers and eliminated them all for reasons having to do either with geographical origin or , as with Shoemaker and Pendleton , with the importance of their present duties . He sat back grimly in his chair . " We 're really hitting bilge-bottom , " he said . " Jupiter , how short-handed we are here ! If Washington could sit in on this conference  --  upiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd ship out fagairtrans those fifteen additional officers and thirty-five yeomen I 've requested . Well ! " he said , expelling breath . Arcing his swivel chair , the exec 's eyes , which seemed glued like marbles onto his face , roamed the rows of lieutenants , lieutenants junior grade and ensigns . " One way or another all of you are unsuitable . Except ... " Suddenly chair and eyes stopped . " Lieutenant Griffin ! " the exec said with abrupt enthusiasm . " Now someone tell me why I did n't think of Griffin ! You know what we 'd often do at Merrill Lynch ? " the exec said suddenly . " What was that , sir ? " Griffin inquired respectfully . " Often we would give a job to the very man who opposed it . Like you have this . " " That 's a very interesting policy , sir , " Griffin said . " What was the philosophy behind it ? " " No philosophy ! " the exec said . " We just did it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectfully suggest that I did n't ' oppose ' it . I deliberately , trying to be helpful , devil-advocated it , as you say ... " " Griffin , " the exec interrupted menacingly , " what do you say we just have a look at your doss-ee-ay . " Iloisting his sextant again , the exec began to sight through it at the top of the door , while Lieutenant Morey Griffin moved uneasily in his chair. 88 89 Thinking big " For one thing , " the exec said , his eyes ranging from the sextantto Griffin , " you 're a pretty average Joe Blow sort . " " It 's nice of you to say that , sir , and the job is a challenge all right , " Griffin said nervously as Nash resumed his sextant gazings . " The only thing , I did serve on a ship once and I do n't know how detached I could be about writing up news items on the men at sea . My actual experience , that is to say , limits the sense of imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . " " That sounds pretty confusing to me , " Nash said suspiciously . " Incidentally , Griffin , " he added testily , " do you have to keep throwing your sea duty up to us ? Just remember , sea duty is n't everything the way the Navy is today . Today 's Navy more and more has honorable duty ashore as well as afloa  --  itness us here . I know plenty of officers who rank you , " he said meaningfully , looking at Griffin over his sextant , " who have n't been near a ship . " " So do I , " Griffin said soberly . " Sorry , Commander . I did n't mean it in a boastful way at all . Quite the contrary . What I meant is that sea duty is not only not everything in the Navy today but can actually be a serious handicap to a man . But besides that , " he went on hurriedly , " I 'm not , unfortunately , from the Midwest . I 'm from San Francisco . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the country to go to midshipmen 's school in New York . And that was in an airplane . The crossing I mean . Frankly , " Griffin summed up , " I 'd love to have the job but I 'm honestly forced to say that I do n't feel quite qualified . " " California is not in the guts of America , I 'll admit , " Nash said . " Bu  --  id you ever go to school , Griffin ? " " U.C.L.A. , " said Griffin proudly . " That 's in your favor , " said Nash , lowering his sextant and eying Griffin critically . " A cross-section , mass-production , assembly-lineschool . " " Sir , " said Griffin , who was getting alarmed at this snowballing threat to his leisure , " someone has just occurred to me . I do n't know why any of us has n't thought of him before . I should have thought of him before myself , but it took your recent remarks in some manner to put him in my mind . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this critical department ? " Abruptly , Lieutenant Griffin had come to his feet . His voice sang loudly through the room to where even the exec , laying his sextant down , listened attentively , as if captured by the conviction in Griffin 's tones . " Commander ! " Griffin said . " I give you an officer who , a point rnagnificently in his favor for a job like this , is probably too modest , the hallmark of a good officer as our exec has said , to suggest himself . An officer who has never been to sea . An officerwho is small-town through and through . A good ma  --  hat is , office  --  n honest officer , a selfless officer . An officer who , " Griffin said , his voice coming to the climax of someone making a nominating speech at the Republican National Convention , " hails from Iowa , which is as Midwestern as corn on the cob and Carl Sandburg . Sir , I respectfully offer you and suggest that the ideal candidate for Home Town News or Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , swept up by Griffin 's speech , turned , to the last officer , to look at an apple-cheeked little man with very straight and very black hair parted so severely in the middle as to look like the center stripe for a black macadam road . With all these eyes on him Noah smiled gently . Nash sat back in his chair and gazed steadily at Noah , a man of meek and retiring nature who worked in the Media Section . Noah blushed . " You know , I entirely overlooked Noah , " the exec said slowly , looking at Pratt . " But the only reason , " he explained it , apparentlyso Pratt would n't feel hurt , " was that sometimes I just do n't usually realize Noah is even there , he 's so inconspicuous . Inconspicuous ! By Jupiter ! I believe you may actually have some-90 91 Thinking bigthing , Griffin . Brief us a little on your background , Noah , " the exec said , anchoring himself deep in his chair again and hoisting his sextant back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said diffidently . You had to listen carefully to hear Noah 's tenor voice . " I was born , grew up and have lived all of my life in Cartertown , Iowa , which has a population of 8,000 . Father and I are the proprietors and operators of Pratt and Son , a department store serving a city and farm market of 25,000 with everything from women 's lingerie to power mowers . I did depart Cartcrtown for four years to study business administrationat the University of Iow  --  hough Father was n't very keen on that , being a self-made man . But then I came right back to Pratt and Son , where I stayed until I volunteered for a commission in the Nav  --  nd where I shall return when the war is concluded . " " Whenever that is , " said Griffin . Nash looked irritably from his sextant at Griffin . " Mind your rudder , Griffin , " he snapped . " Not bad , Noah , " the exec said genially , gazing through the sextant at his ship 's bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility in the department store ? " " Yes , sir ! " Noah said proudly . " I am the Son ' of the store 's name . I did all the buyin  --  ith Father 's approval of the orders , of cours  --  nd under his supervision directed the store 's personnel . " Noah smiled shyly . " As a matter of fact , this is a coincidence , for only last week I received a letter from Father that he plans to officially retire when I reach forty , two years from now , making me President of Pratt and Son . Though , of course , as he mentioned , " Noah added honestly , The expects , as chairman of the board , to keep an eye on the store as long as he 's alive , and continue to do all the hiring . But I 'll be President . " The exec lowered his sextant and carefully replaced it in the drawer . A decisive look came across his face . " You know , Sailors , I see it all now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter its merited thought , " he intoned , " to havea man in charge of this who is so inconspicuous that you do n't realize he 's even there , a man who just fades into the landscape . That 's what Joe Blow is anyhow . Unsung ! Unrecognized ! Almost invisible . Like you , come to think about it , Noah . " The exec pulled himself erect in his chair . " Noah , it 's a real responsibility I 'm putting on yo  --  onsidering that you 've never had a naval comman  --  ut I 'm going to take the chance . I 'm giving you a tr  --  try , you understand , " the exec said threateningly , " in command of our newest and one of our most vital divisions , the Home Town News Department , which I hereby commission . Noah , from now on you are Lieutenant Joe Blow ! " Noah looked stunned . " Commander , " he said humbly , " all I can say is : I 'll give it everything I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the exec said briskly . He sat forward intently , his elbows on the desk , his chin resting in his clasped hands , his eyes looking dead ahead into the " Think Big ! " legend on the wall . " Sailors , " he said , " I have a feeling that somehow this has been one of our most fruitful sessions . Only heaven knows what will come of it . Conference dismissed ! " Lieutenant Commander Nash promptly got off a dispatch directingall commanding officers of all ships to designate additional-dutyHome Town News officers from their present complements . Then Lieutenant Noah Pratt and the yeoman he was given got up a Joe Blow form , under Nash 's supervision , with spaces for police-blotter-type information about the subject enlisted man , followed by a big space for " News Item , " and sent the forms out to the ships . Then they sat back and waited for the avalanche of answers which would furnish Noah the material with which to start swamping home-town newspapers all over the States . Several weeks passed without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Noah and his yeoman to write stories from and dispatch to stateside home-town newspapers . Probably the Home Town News officer on the ship , not fully92 93 Thinking bigappreciating , from his narrow vantage point , the importance of the program , got busy with his main duties of helping run the ship and just did n't get around to filling out the Joe Blow forms . Nash spent a lot of time trying to figure a way to prime the flow . One day at a conference he came up with it . " It 's a pure case of laziness on the part of these officers on the ships , " he said angrily , " and of downright stupidit  --  ot realizing that in this Public Relations Age a Navy is something bigger than merely running ships . But let 's do n't let their laziness and their stupidity put us off course . We can do the whole thing right from here ! Why do n't we procure rosters of personnel from all the ships ? Then every time the ship does somethin  --  hells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ll the Home Town News officer aboard has to do is fire us a brief dispatch saying so . If the lazy meathead ca n't even do that , most times we wo n't even need to wait for a dispatc  --  e 'll just pluck the item out of operational dispatches . " The exec leaned forward excitedly . " Do you begin to get it ? We get up a story on the event with some blank spaces in it , mimeograph it off , then simply fill in the man 's name from the ship 's roster , like Blank Blank of Blank was aboard the U.S.S. Missouri recently when that ship 's sixteen-inchers disabled Yokohama , ' and fire it back to the guy 's home-town paper . Visualize it ! The Missouri alone has 2,700 men aboard . Any time she did anything , just anything at all , that would automatically mean 2,700 stories in papers all over the States ! " The exec paused for breath . " Think of it ! The thousands of ships we have ! The hundreds of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The millions of stories that would be gushing from them to us ! From us to the thousands of tanktown papers in the U.S. We 'd swamp them under ! Why , this thing might be to naval public relations what the inventionof the machine gun was to land warfare ! " " Commander , " said Lieutenant Commander Gladney eagerly , " we ca n't miss . It 's the most watertight conception I ever heard of . Why , it 's like sailing the Fifth Fleet , all guns blazing , into every city room in America ! These tens of thousands of stories ! Why , it 'll sink them , Commander ! " " Commander , " said Lieutenant Commander Hereford enthusiastically , " these possibilities stagger the imagination ! " " Not mine , Wayne , " the exec said crisply . The exec got off a dispatch to all ships , directing them to forwardships ' rosters and home-towns fagairtrans to Tulura . That did it . Hundreds of big fat bundles were soon hitting Public Relations Headquarters . Administrative-wise it was a revolution . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one corner and his single yeoman , Noah 's department blossomed into a separate section , filling the entire middle portion of the first floor and employing eleven men . A lot of space was required to store the ships ' rosters alone . Noah got much less meek and retiring after that , and found himself working feverishly to keep out from under . A single actionof the Missouri , as Nash said , meant 2,700 stories . Noah himself wrote the basic story in each case and his men filled in the thousands of blanks . The story would lead off with a bombardment , for example , and the fact the local Joe Blow took part in it . The second paragraph would relate how happy Blow was aboard ship and the third and fourth would detail wh  --  he soda fountain aboard , the library and so on . Four or five more paragraphswould be taken up with the history of the ship . A stencil of the story would be cut , the form run off on a mimeograph machine , each form filled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters addressed and mailed to home-town papers . " The Home Town News Department this week , " Noah was soon able to announce proudl  --  nd loudly , his voice enlarging in direct ratio to his jo  --  t the daily conference , " dispatched 28,125 stories to newspapers in forty-eight states and Puerto Rico . " " Tremendous ! " the exec exclaimed . " Noah , I ca n't help point-94 95 Thinking biging ou  --  nd in front of your co-shipmates , notic  --  hat a seaworthyjob you 're doing with those ships ' rosters . Thinking big ! That 's what I like to see . We 're perfecting a new journalistic technique that may be revolutionary . After all , this is the age of mass production and we may be really the first to apply it to news stories . Even an Associated Press story has some individualityto it . It 's Joe Blow of Kokomo people want to hear about ! Let us never forget that ! " " I ca n't speak for the other officers , " Noah said loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it . Guess what our goal is ? A hundred thousand stories a week from Tulura deluging the home front ! " " Why stop at a hundred thousand , Pratt ? " the exec said reprovingly . " I mean just our immediate goal , Commander , " Lieutenant Pratt apologized . " After that , who knows ? Commander ! Now that I 've given Home Town News ' report . . . do you mind if I scoot out ? We 're really snowed . Suh-nowed , " he repeated . The center portion of the first floor soon resembled the mailordersection of Sears Roebuck at the summit of the Christmas shopping season . Before long , eighteen typewriters and four mimeographmachines were blazing away , filing cabinets with ships ' rosters were stacked to the overhead , and three chief petty officers , eighteen yeomen , six seamen first class and four seamen second class , plus additional mail help that had to be employed in the Post Office , manned the operation . As the ships ' rosters poured in and Navy vessels flung about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take much to make a good Joe Blow item , as Nash pointed ou  --  he Home Town News Departmentwas forced to go on a three-watch , twenty-four-hour basis . Noah really drove himself , working self and crew like a pack of beavers building Grand Coulee . He pushed the weekly total of Home Town News stories up to a steady 50,000 , and still going , and passing in the corridors outside his office you could hear his voice loudly giving commands to his crew . " McCloskey ! Bringme the New Jersey 's roster ! " . . . " Chief ! I want this batch of stories on the night plane to Pearl without fail ! " . . . " Hogate ! See if we can move that mimeograph a little faster ! " and a shrill , frenzied laugh . " You 're holding up the war ! Faster , man ! Faster ! " It got pretty noticeable , Noah working sixteen hours a day and the rest of the Public Relations officers devoting no more than a half to two or three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Lieutenant Blow never even drops in here any more ? " Lieutenant Griffin observed one night at the bar . " It 's unnatural for a man to work that hard . On Tulura anyhow . " " jealous because you did n't get the job ? " asked Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton . " Now that it 's turned into a real wheel job and Noah 's bossing more men than some ships have in their crews . " " Did n't get the job ! " Griffin exclaimed testily . " Hell , I refused it . You think I , with my extensive big-city newspaper experience , want to do filler copy for a bunch of tanktown sheets ? " " You know , " Pendleton said , " lately Noah 's been so busy he 's been having chow sent to his office . " " Chow sent to his office ! " Griffin looked unbelieving and outraged .

" " For Christ 's sake , " Griffin said , looking over his shoulder . " Do n't talk about that out loud . It 's at a delicate stage , like the diplomatic discussions before the signing of a four-power pact . Sh-h . Here comes Nash . " The exec was a picture of the model tropical officer as he came in . He was wearing his British khaki shorts which with the ankle96 97 Thinking bigsocks afforded two great hairy expanses of leg . His lieutenant commander oak leaves gleamed brightly on the collar of his short-sleeved shirt . His head was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's shiel  --  hough this was a Navy-issue item on Tulura , the exec was the only officer at Headquarters who had had the nerve to wear one . He was twirling a native-made officer 's swagger stick of the type which had recently gone on sale at ship 's service . Striding up , the exec halted , removed his Frank Buck hat and rapped his swagger stick smartly on the bar . " Rum sour , Leatherneck ! " The exec looked briskly around him . " Well ! I do n't see Noah here , I do n't , I do n't . That boy really puts us all to shame ! " " It 's not that we are n't willing , Commander , " Griffin said defensively . " I do seem to remember , " Nash said , and tapped his swagger stick ominously on the bar , " that you had a chance to be LieutenantJoe Blow , Morey . I seem to remember that you turned it down . " Morey shifted his elbow uneasily on the bar . " Only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander . The best man for the job , that is . " " Oh , of course , the best man for the job , " Nash said with a chuckle that had just a tiny edge to it . He looked around meaningfullyat the other officers . " Commander , we do a job all right , " Morey said . " Myself , I never quite get through with it all in the Media Section . Sometimesit 's true that the specialized nature of our work does n't require all of us to put in a full twelve hours a day every day . You take Ross here . Now the best radio liaison officer in the world could n't put in more than forty-five minutes a day here on Tulura . But you 've got to have a liaison officer , to keep the radio correspondents happy . I ca n't imagine what the radio correspondentswould be like without a liaison officer . Probably even more hasty-tempered than they are anyway , if that 's possible . Ofcourse , I suppose Ross could pitch in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always use more help in Media . " " It 's really thoughtful of you , Morey , " said Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton , flaming up , " how you look outside yourself for examples . The exec knows about my wor  --  hich is far too technicalfor you to understan  --  nd I daresay does n't need any reports on it from a fifty-dollar-a-week newspaper hack . Do you , Clin-ton ? " " Sixty dollars a week , " Griffin corrected the radio program officer . " Now , Sailors , I did n't mean to stir anything up . You know that I 'm against ' made ' work . I often reproach myself for not running a taut enough ship here . I 'm not a sundowne  --  avy for martinet , " the exec explained . " Indeed I 've always been the genial sort .

A joke , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproached . The exec rapped Griffin playfully and painfully on the shoulderwith his swagger stick . " Yes , siree , " he continued . " I 'm against ' manufactured ' labor . But sometimes if a man keeps a weather eye open , an idle hand ? not that we have much of that , except for the one or two usual goof-offs in any big organizatio  --  an find work to do . If nothing else , he can always think ! Why , I thought of the Joe Blow Departmentidea itself when I was n't doing anything else . Well , I 'm having chow with the captain tonight , " he said , glancing at his watch . " Now do n't you boys think I was mentioning Noah as a comparison to anyone 's detriment . All the same , an executive officer ca n't help but be impressed by the lad 's devotion to his work . Up there right now chewing a fried Spani sandwich and slashing through that sea of rosters while we stow away rum sours ! " The exec plunked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment then pulled out a quarter and plunked it down on the98 99 Thinking bigcounter . " Leatherneck ! Set up a round for everybody ! " he said with a sweep of his hand . " Night , men ! " and , sticking his Frank Buck hat on his head and twirling his swagger stick , he was gone . Ross turned viciously on Griffin . " Why do you have to bring me up ! I do twice the work you do . " " I guess you do at that , " Griffin said glumly . " Sometimes you put in a full two hours a day . " Morey sloshed his rum sour . " God damn ! " he said emphatically . " We 've got to do something about Lieutenant Blow . The little beaver is derailing the gravy train . I think , " he said thoughtfully , rubbing his chin , " I 'll mosey up to his shop after chow , just to see what the atmosphere is like . I might pick up some ideas . Like the exec said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along , Max ? " Ensign Siegel , who had been standing observantly at the bar during all this , belched . " Listen , Griffin , " he told the lieutenant , " do n't get a fry on . Do n't let Nash make you feel insecure . Yeh , I 'll come . Noah ought to rev down , for his own health . That whole Joe Blow Department ought to rev down or the war 'll never get over . All the ships , supplies , manpower tied up in sending this junk back to home-town papers ! Who gives a continental what Joe Blow does ! All this coddling treatment for Joe Blows ! First thing you know , Griffin , we 'll have enlisted men calling officers by their first names . " " Meantime , " said Griffin , looking steadily at Siegel , " let 's see if we can at least avoid the catastrophe of ensigns calling full lieutenants by their last . Off your ass and let 's go , Siegel . " After chow , Griffin and Siegel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office , first came back to the bar and stayed until it closed . By the time they did make it up to Home Town News it was well after midnight , Noah had retired to his room to snatch a few hours ' sleep , and a chief petty officer was supervisingthe comparatively small 0000-o800 watc  --  our yeomensitting at typewriters filling in the blank spaces from the ship 's roster of the U.S.S.

" Ought to get the Pulitzer . Well , Chief , we 're just on the town . " " Make yourself right at home , sir , " the chief said genially . " Just please observe the no-smoking sign in our Ammo room , heh , heh , " the chief made a joke and laughed at it , giving a grand sweep of his arm toward a great battery of metal filing cases stacked to the overhead . " Names ! I never knew even the phone directory had so many names . " With a flourish the chief pulled open one of the deep drawers . With both hands he lifted out one bulging folder and handed it to Griffin . " The ship 's roster of the U.S.S.

" God damn , here he is . Lieutenant Jorgenson ! Two promotions since I saw him in midshipmen 's school . And the stupid jerk almost busted out ! We used to call him Mortimer Snerd . Say , this is fun ! You wo n't be offended if we check up on some of our contemporaries and old arse-hole buddies , Chief ? " " Help yourself , sir ! You do n't mind if I get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard the 0645 plane to the State  --  e 've got space reserved for zoo pounds of Home Town News stories . Here , use this desk . " For an hour or so Griffin and Siegel thumbed through the ships ' rosters checking on their friends from midshipmen 's school . " Albritto  --  e 's first lieutenant now on the James D. Foster , " Siegel would say . " Old Wainwright , " he would exclaim over a folder , " ? Wacky Wainwright ' we used to call hi  --  e 's exec on his minesweeper ! God damn ! This is fun ! " Once , thumbing through the ship 's roster of an APA named the Ankletooth , Siegel abruptly laughed . " Here 's a great naval name for you . Farragut Jones , Boatswain 's Mate Second Class . Imagine parents named Jones who would stick a poor defenseless baby with the name Farragut . " Lieutenant Griffin looked up from an aircraft carrier roster . " Just foresighted . He ended up in the Navy , did n't he ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , " Seigel said . " Farragut Jones . " Griffin , still feeling some of the effects of the hours at the bar , suddenly doubled up with laughter . " Farragut Jones ! " he repeated . He started laughing until the tears came . Siegel looked disgustedly at the lieutenant . " Griffin , you 've had it . Rock-happy . " " Farragut Jones ! " Griffin repeated , roaring hysterically , so that the typing yeomen looked up , momentarily , baffled . " The perfect Joe Blow , " Siegel said . " The Navy would havehim on a poster or something if the Public Relations brass ever got hold of him . " " He 's from Appleton , Nebraska . . . " Griffin said , taking the Ankletooth 's roster from Siegel . " Say . . . " He looked curiously over at Max . " What did you say ? The perfect Joe Blow ? " He rubbed his chin . " You know , he is at that . With a name like that . A boatswain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Griffin rubbed his chin a little longer . " You know , Siegel , I think you 've got something for a change . Why , this man is a gold mine ! I think I 'll try my hand , " Griffin said abruptly . " Been one helluva long time . " Seating himself at one of the several vacant typewriters , he tickled his fingers over the keys without depressing them . Then he stuck in a sheet of paper and after gazing a moment into space batted out a dateline : WITH THE U.S.S. ANKLETOOTH AT SEAHegazed off another moment then wrote : Despite the handicap of being a Boatswain 's Mate Second Class , Farragut Jones of Appleton , Neb. , has established himself as one of the most popular men aboard this battling U.S. Navy ship . The writer says " despite this handicap " because a boatswain 's mate has to boss the deck crew in some uncommonlydistasteful jobs , such as chipping paint , scrubbing down decks and cleaning heads . A head is Navy for bathroom . But so relentlessly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even paint-chipping , deck-scrubbing and head-cleaning is a part of winning the war that Ankletoothis one of the smartest , tautest vessels in the entire PacificFleet . And as one of Farragut 's two naval namesakes , John Paul Jones , once observed : " A taut ship is a happy ship . " When he had finished writing the item and pulled it out of the L.C. Smith and read it , Griffin liked it so much that he decided102 103 Thinking bigit would be a shame to throw it away . So while Siegel read it over , he looked up the Appleton paper in the Home Town News Section 's copy of Ayer 's newspaper directory . Then he got an envelope and addressed it to the Appleton Weekly Courier . Siegel picked up a pencil , changed one word ? " philosophy " to " notion " ? and gave the copy back to Griffin , who folded it , stuck it in the envelope and licked the flap . Then , as the two officersstarted out , Griffin held the envelope delicately between his thumb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Outgoing Mail " that was filled with several hundred other envelopesaddressed to newspapers all over the States . " Guess that ought to answer Marblehead 's libel that LieutenantMorey Griffin is caulking off , " said Griffin . During the next few weeks Griffin and Siegel , with Griffin doingthe writing , fed a steady stream of Farragut Jones stories to the Appleton Weekly Courier . WITH THE U.S.S. ANKLETOOTH AT SE  --  oatswain 's Mate SecondClass Farragut Jones of Appleton , Neb. , played a critical role recently when this battling U.S. naval vessel delivered a batch of United States Marine  --  he land arm of the Navy ? to duty on Guam . By " critical role " the writer means that Farragut was in charge of the deck force which had to keep the ship in apple-pie , shipshape conditio  --  o easy task with a pack of seagoing bellhops , as the untidy Marines are known humorously to Navy men , aboard . Farragut is well in the traditionof one of his two famous naval namesakes , David Farragut , who once observed , " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siegel procured a copy of the history of the Ankletoothfrom Lieutenant Shoemaker and interlarded authentic detailsof the ship 's shape and history in the stories of Farragut Jones .

Namewise and otherwise , Farragut is almost the perfect prototype of the unknown , unsung Navy men who are sweatingthe United States to victory in the Pacific . By " unsung " the writer means that most untutored civilians think only the men who fire the guns and shoot the torpedoes win the war . Not true . Farragut never fires a gun , never shoots a torpedo .

" Griffin and Siegel must have got off a score of Farragut Jones stories when the word was passed one day that all officers were to assemble for a special conference . The exec held up a bundle of clippings . " Something mysterious is going on , " he said slowly . " It appears that unauthorized persons are horning in on Naval Public Rela-tions . " Somberly the exec passed the clippings from the Appleton Weekly Courier around . As he scanned through them , Griffin felt a pride of authorship that the Courier 's editor had changed scarcely a word in his stories . " Where did they come from , Commander ? " he asked . " Navy Department ! " exclaimed Nash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's where the Navy Department was located the last time I heard , " Nash said irritably . " The editor of the Appleton paper has written the Navy Department with the most ignorant suggestionI ever heard of . " io4 105 Thinking bigThe exec whipped a letter off his desk and read : " In view of the notable record accumulated by one of Appleton 's own , Boatswain'sMate Second Class Farragut Jones ? " one of the Navy 's most decorated enlisted men " ? and in view of his name , epitomizingthe Navy , I respectfully suggest that the Navy give earnest consideration to returning Farragut to the United States for a hero 's welcome in the town where he grew up . As a symbol of the Navy 's enlisted man , the Navy might then elect to take Farraguton a tour of the war plants where naval items are produced . This would provide the workers with a look at the type of man using the items they turn out , and hearing about the effectiveness of those items first-hand from Farragut would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Nav  --  nderstand , I 'm not , as a country editor , trying to tell you admirals how to run the Navy .

My sole concernis that , should the project of returning Farragut briefly to the States be accepted , we here in Appleton have at our hero first . ' " The exec threw the letter down on his desk . " This hicktown meathead editor wrote this garbage to SecNav , who passed it on to Navy Department Public Relations , which has forwarded the letter to us asking for more details about Farragut Jones . Imagine how this makes us look to Washington ! Not even knowing about these stories ! Not even ever having heard of Farragut Jones ! " The exec looked steadily at the " Do n't Give Up The Ship ! " legend , then suddenly spun in his chair . " Ankletooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States ! Violation of security regulation  --  n wartime a general court-martial offense punishable by up to and including death . Going over our head ! Not going through the chain of command ! Who does he think he is ! Probably just an ensign , too . Also , there is obviously something fishy going on her  --  t the least the Ankletooth 's Joe Blow officer is guilty of gross exaggeration . Navy 's most decorated enlisted man ' indeed ! Why , an APA could n't have the most decorated enlisted man ! They never do a damn thing but ferry troops around . " " Does n't it say most decorated APA enlisted man ' ? " asked Griffin . Nash looked sharply at Griffin , then examined a clipping . " Why , so it does . How did you know ? " " I just read the clipping , " said Griffin . " Anyhow , that does n't change the point . That sounds like a ruse . How would Ankletooth 's Joe Blow officer know that anyway ? " Nash said in a burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe he checked around with the other APA 's , " Griffin said . " Even an ensign could do that . " He looked at another clipping . " Not a bad piece of copy , incidentally . " " I do n't care if Ernie Pyle wrote it ! " Nash said , inflamed . " It 's put us in a very embarrassing position . Public Relations going on without us knowing about it ! " " But was n't that the whole idea of the Joe Blow Department ? " Griffin said . " To get more Navy enlisted men stories ? This batch of clippings . . . well , I 'd say , sir , that we 've hit the jackpot . " " Jackpot or not , it 's supposed to go through us ! " Nash shouted . " You ca n't have every Tom , Dick and Harry taking Naval Public Relations into his own hands ! Why , we might have chaos ! I 'm getting off a dispatch to Ankletooth 's commanding officer , orderinga full explanation ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The exec leaned forward and looked fiercely around the circle of officers . " Anyone here know anything about this ? " He whirled on the chief of the I-Iome Town News Section . " Noah , you sure you do n't know anything about Farragut Jones ? " " Never heard of the individual , " Noah said , his voice almost inaudible for the first time in a long time . " Like I checked and told you , sir , it sure did n't go through our shop . " Griffin started to say something , but looking at Siegel 's impassiveeyes he let his lips fall together wordlessly. i.o6 107 Thinking big " All right , Sailors , " the exec said grimly , dismissing the conference . " I 'll get off that dispatch . We 'll get to the bottom of this , or my name is n't Lieutenant Commander Joe Blow of Kokomo . " As soon as they were outside and Griffin could get Siegel aside , he grabbed him by the collar . " Jesus Christ , man ! Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The son of a bitch should have been grateful to get some decent copy for a change to fill his lousy hick sheet . " " IIe 's grateful all right , " said Siegel . " He just wants more of it . " " Listen , Max , " Griffin said nervously . " This is serious . What we gon na do ? " " Lieutenant , " said Siegel , " I do n't know . " " I do n't want to get anyone on the Ankletooth in trouble , " Griffin said magnanimously . " Why , I would n't worry about that , Lieutenant , " Siegel said . " All the Ankletooth will do is send back an answer they do n't know anything about it . They are n't going to get in any trouble , Lieutenant . " " Listen , Siegel , " Griffin said . " Do n't give me that Lieutenant business . You 're in this , too , you know . " " Now , Lieutenant , " Siegel said calmly , " this is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need what friends you 've got left . " " I 'm sorry , Max , " said Griffin . " I 'm a little rattled . Just call me Morey . What we gon na do ? " " I guess we better go in and see Marblehead , huh ? " " I guess so , " Griffin said miserably . " I guess we better go in before he sends that dispatch out . It might go a little easier to tell him voluntarily than to be found out later involuntarily . " " Do n't give up the ship , I always say , " said Siegel , " and you better , too . " The two officers turned and went back upstairs and knocked at the commander 's door . " Come in ! " They heard an irritated voice , and opened the door . The exec was pecking away furiously at his typewriter . " Commander , " Griffin said , " could we see you a moment ? " " Ca n't you see I 'm trying to get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Nash said , irritated . " Wait outside for fifteen minutes , will you ? " " Commander , " said Griffin quietly , " this concerns the Farragut Jones matter . " Slowly Nash looked up at Griffin . He said nothing for a few moments . Then : " All right , spit . " " Commander , " Griffin began , and immediately had to clear his throat , " I 'm afraid w  --  iegel and I , that i  --  ad a certain finger in the Farragut Jones series . " Nash 's eyes swelled , then returned to a cold , cold size . " You see , " Griffin went on in the engulfing silence . " Siegel here and I had an idea for getting the Navy some more publicity ? that being what we 're here fo  --  nd one night when we were up in the Joe Blow Section , pitching in , we came across this man with the perfect Navy name . " Griffin laughed hollowly . " FarragutJones . ' You 'll have to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander ? " The exec , listening with fingers pursed to lips , did not move an eyelash . " As Siegel here said , " Criffin went on , " That 's just about the perfect Navy name . If the Navy knew about it they 'd probably do a special public relations campaign just on this man alone . ' That 's about what you said . Is n't it , Max ? " " Something like that , Lieutenant , " Siegel said . " You may not have quoted me word for word exactl  --  t 's been a long time and a man ca n't always remember a direct quote word for wor  --  ut that 's about it , certainly the guts of what I said . Guts , " he repeated , looking at Griffin . " So there we were , " Griffin said , clearing his throat . His eyes rested unhappily on the wooden " Do n't Give Up The Ship ! " legend on the wall . Then the other legend below it gave up an idea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Think Big . ' So we sat down and wrote these stories about Farragutro8Jones . Actually , the idea was n't bad . Was it , Commander ? " The exec did not speak or move for a full minute , but he never took his eyes off Griffin . Then he pulled the Ankletooth dispatch out of his typewriter , crumpled it slowly and tossed it in his wastebasket , where it hit the empty metal with an ominous crackle . The exec sat up high in his chair and spread his fingers on his desk . Suddenly both hands shot forward , pulled out the huge copy of Navy Regulations and banged it once on the desk , in a terrible noise . The sawed-off five-inch-shell ashtray jumped a full inch and crashed back on the desk . " I should not be surprised to see both of you young men cashiered ! Dishonorably discharged . Or worse . Meantime , consider yourselves confined to quarters pending the court-martial . " " Confined to quarters ! " Griffin exclaimed . " What are we going to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I 'm concerned ! " the exec shouted . " Now git ! " " But , Commander , " Griffin whined , " we were just trying to do what you said , not be an idle hand all the time but think up ideas ... " " Belay it , I say ! " the exec suddenly shouted . " Go to your quarters , both of you ! Or shall I call the shore patrol ! Sabotaging my vital Joe Blow program of making every American Navyconscious , that 's what you 've tried to do ! Sabotage in time of war ! You 'll be lucky to escape with a bad conduct discharge instead of ten to twenty years in Portsmouth . Shove off ! Both of you ! " Griffin filed miserably out , followed by Siegel , who appeared exceedingly calm . " Great God ! " Griffin exclaimed when they were outside the exec 's office . " A court-martial ! Great God , Max ! Confined to our room ! What are we going to do about eatin  --  nd drinking ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken care of when we act to Portsmouth , " Ensign Siegel said reassuringly. 209 Thinking big " Great God , Max ! " Griffin exclaimed . " Do n't joke about this ! This is serious , man ! Why , that son of a bitch is capable of doing it , you know ! That Joe Blow project 's really his pet ! " " Well , it was not a bad piece of copy , incidentally , " Siegel said . " Max , you 're in this , too , do n't forget that ! " Griffin exclaimed . " You ought to know that by now ! " " Yes , I know it , " Siegel s : . id slowly , and suddenly a smile of contentment enveloped his face . Lieutenant Griffin , astonished and outraged , glared at his ensign-roommate . " What the hell are you grinning about ? " he shouted furiously . " A court-martial ! Confined to our room ! And you stand there grinning like a water buffalo in a mud bath ! " " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't mind if I do . " The morning sun of the islands filtered into a room in one of the BOQ 's and across the forms of two officers propped up comfortably in their beds against three pillows each . They had just finished a hearty breakfast in bed of sunnyside eggs , bacon , toast and orange marmalade and were now enjoying their third pot of coffee for which they had dispatched the steward 's mate to the mess hall . " You know , Max , " Lieutenant Griffin said , " it 's strange how I failed fully to see the possibilities of confinement yesterday . Room service ! " Siegel 's first act had been to send word to the mess hall that , considering as how he and Lieutenant Griffin were confined to their room , they would be obliged to have their meals in . " What other choice did they have ? " Ensign Siegel said . " After all , you ca n't let a U.S. naval officer starve . " After breakfast Ensign Siegel and Lieutenant Griffin prepared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOQ steward 's mate , to the Fleet Library to check them out . The two officers stayed inbed all morning reading , propped against their three pillows each . The requisitioning of these pillows from general stores had been Siegel 's second act upon confinement . " Here 's a passage from Henry V that 's always been a favorite of mine , " Ensign Siegel said , and read aloud a few lines . " This is one of the best twists Ellery Queen has come up with yet , " Lieutenant Griffin said a little later from his book . " Listen to this one . " The reading of the two officers was interrupted at noon by the arrival of lunch on trays . They ate a hearty lunch and afterwards spent an enjoyable couple of hours playing gin rummy . Siegel , who liked chess a great deal and had tried many times , unsuccess- fully , to find someone on Tulura who played , attempted to teach the game to Griffin , but after an hour or so , Griffin gave up . " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like work . " By mid-afternoon they found themselves hungry again , and even Siegel hesitated to send to the mess hall for between-meal snacks . However , a thought of Griffin 's solved this problem . " Is n't Lieutenant Junior Grade Marconi Pendleton away to one of the islands on one of his radio missions ? " he said . " Why , I believe that 's true , " Ensign Siegel said . " What do you have in mind ? " " I do n't know if you 're familiar with those interesting ship- ments Mrs. Pendleton dispatches her husband weekly from the home front ? " Lieutenant Griffin inquired . " Yes , indeed , " Ensign Siegel said . " What a devoted woman Mrs. Pendleton must be . " " Almost as devoted , " Lieutenant Griffin said , " as the many Navy nurses on Tulura who think they 're going to be Mrs. Pen- dleton , not knowing that the position is already taken . You know , I think I 'll just step down to Pendleton 's room . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a serious viola- tion of our confinement ? " Ensign Siegel reflected a moment . " I hardly see how it could iii Thinking bigget us in any worse than we are , " he said . " In any case I can mount a lookout for Nash . " Lieutenant Griffin returned from the short trip with his arms full of tinned delicacies . They made a delightful teatime snack . The evening Ensign Siegel and Lieutenant Griffin devoted to drinking numerous shakers of rum sours which Henry fetched from the officers ' bar , which was hardly a stone 's throw away from the BOQ . By the third day the two officers were growing quite plump , rested , relaxed , and well-read . " Is n't it commendable how the service improves every day , " Ensign Siegel said over breakfast in bed that morning . " Four pieces of bacon ! It was a happy thought , sending for that extra shaker of rum sours for the steward 's mate . " By the fifth day of confinement , largely due to the lavish passingout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two officersfound themselves receiving the pampering to which a guest at the Greenbrier is accustomed . They were served delicate omeletsand golden griddle cakes for breakfas  --  tems which never showed their faces in the mess hall , thick steaks cooked to order for dinner ; their bed linen was changed daily and their beds made every time they got out of them . " There 's only one thing softer than working en Tulura , " said Lieutenant Griffin , by now almost overcome with euphoria , " and that 's not working on Tulura . " Ensign Siegel and Lieutenant Griffin would have been quite surprised to know that Lieutenant Commander Nash had completelyforgotten about them . The reason was that among the swelling ranks of Public Relations officers , the absence of a mere two was entirely unnoticeable , especially since hardly an officer there did a job specific enough to be missed if he should vanish into the atmosphere . Presumably the pair of them might have had breakfast in bed for the duration had not Admiral Boatwright had112 113 Thinking biga rare moment of leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routinely went to his office , he happened to glance at a dispatchfrom Washington to Public Relations . Nash got a call from the admiral 's aide to come over on the double , the admiral wanted to see him . Grabbing up his Frank Buck helmet , the exec sped on over to the building next door , where Admiral Boatwright 's aide ushered him immediately into the admiral 's office . There he found the admiral and Captain Jarvis , the titular chief of Public Relations , huddled over some newspaper clippings . Jarvis was a regular Navy officer who before being assigned recently to his present billet had commanded a cruiser . Nash stood at attention in the middle of the vast room with his Frank Buck helmet in his hand . The admiral gave a disgustedlook at the helmet but apparently he had something more important on his mind right now . " Nash ! " he thundered . " I 've got you here about this Farragut Jones matter ! " " Farragut Jones ? " Nash said , uncomprehending . " Oh , Farragut Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly rememberingwhy he had n't seen Griffin and Siegel around in the last few days . " Farragut Jones ! " he said a third time . " You got the name straight now ? " the admiral said crisply . " Farragut Jones ! " Nash said for the fourth time , uncontrollably . " Sir , you 'll be happy to hear I 've got the two officers who are respon . . . " Sit down , Nash , for God 's sake sit down ! " Boatwright roared . Nash lowered himself into a chair . " I got to reading some of this junk that goes back and forth between your office and Washingtonand something caught my eye . Farragut Jones , Boatswain 's Mate Second Class ! " the admiral boomed . " Aye , aye , sir . " Nash 's voice shook . " Aye , aye , what ? " Admiral Boatwright boomed . " Boatswain 's Mate Farragut Jones ! Do you realize , Nash , " the admiral 's voice rose thunderously , " that John Paul Jones was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was its first admiral ? Boatswain 's Mate Farragut Jones ! What a name for a Navy man ! Probably from an old Navy famil  --  hat with two naval namesake  --  avidFarragut and John Paul Jones , " he repeated , with a look at Nash , as if to make sure he got it . " I should imagine he was born with the last name of Jones , sir , " Nash said . " But you 're right about the Farragut part . Anyone who names his son Farragut must have the good judgment to prefer the Navy to the Air Force . No other reason for naming him Farragut . Otherwise they would have named him something like Billy Mitchell Jone  --  r Charles Lindbergh Jones . " Admiral Boatwright looked up at Nash for a long moment , then returned to the clippings , which were the Griffin-written stories on Farragut Jones which had appeared in the Appleton Weekly Courier . " Sir , " Nash began , " you 'll be happy to know I 've got to the bottom of ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " since I 've always thought all Public Relations people a bunch of either freaks or oddballs . But any outfit which can reach down into the millions of men in the wartime Navy and pull out a boatswain 's mate second class by the name of Farragut Jones . . . That 's initiative ! That 's imagination ! " " But , Admiral , sir . . . " said Nash . " I asked Jarvis here to bring me the whole file on Jones , and I 've just been telling him that I think the Farragut Jones idea is excellent , " said Admiral Boatwright . " And I told the admiral , " Jarvis said , " that I did n't rightly know whose idea it was . It started before my present billet . But I presumeit was yours , Nash ? " " Well , sir , " said Nash , who was almost choking , " I did think it was a good old Navy name . " " Well done ! " Admiral Boatwright said . " But why the hell are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added with a sudden thunder . " What 's holding you the hell up ? " 114 115 Thinking big " Well , sir , " Nash said , trembling , " I wanted to figure all the possible Farragut Jones angles . " " Angles ! " the admiral exploded . " Damn the angles ! Let 's open up with the sixteen-inchers ! " " Aye , aye , sir ! " Nash said , just stopping himself from saluting . " This Nebraska editor 's suggestion of sending him on a tour of Navy war plants is four O ! " the admiral boomed . " I hope you 've already got off a dispatch ordering Jones to Tulura beforesending him to the States . " " I was just preparing a dispatch to the Ankletooth not long ago , " Nash said weakly . " Excellent ! " Admiral Boatwright roared . " Excellent ! What a name , Boatswain 's Mate Second Class Farragut Jones ! The TypicalYoung Navy Man ! " " The ' Typical Young Navy Man ! ' What a phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Admiral , you ought to be in PublicRelations ! " The admiral banged his fist on his desk at the thought and turned an intense purple . " Never mind handling my duty assignments , Nash ! " he roared . Then , flushing the thought out of him , the admiral returned to the matter at hand . " Boatswain 's Mate Second Class Farragut Jones ! " he boomed . " Get him in here , Nash ! Break out the sixteen-inch guns on this one ! All engines ahead full ! Flank speed ! " " Aye , aye , sir , " Nash said weakly , coming to his feet . Lieutenant Commander Nash walked , weaving and dazed a little , out of the admiral 's office and back across the road to the Public Relations building . First he got off a dispatch to the Ankletoothin the name of ComFleets , ordering Jones to report to Tulura . Then he sent for Griffin and Siegel . While waiting for them he took out his Naval Leadership and sat reading , nodding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lubricating oil of human relationships . The man who considers tact unnecessaryin dealing with subordinates is probably the same man whohammers his sextant with a monkey wrench to make it work ... " When the two officers entered , the exec snapped the book shut and looked up , beaming . Siegel looked impassive but Griffin was greatly alarmed , both at the interruption of the days of luxury and at the prospective day of reckoning which , he gathered from the exec 's joyous expression , was at hand . " Sit down , Morey . . . Max , " the exec said . " You realize , of course , that I was only funning when I confined you to quarters . " " Funning ! " exclaimed Griffin , shaken . " Heh , heh , " Nash chuckled . " Even ranks like lieutenant commandershave got to have their little practical joke , you know . " " Practical joke ! " Griffin exclaimed . " Actually , " the exec continued rapidly , " I consider the Farragut Jones series to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Four 0 ! Guess what ? I 've ordered Jones to Tulura before sending him to the States ! " The exec scratched his leg offhandedly while Griffin and Siegel looked on in stupefaction . " Boatswain 's Mate Farragut Jones ! " the exec suddenly sang out . " What a name for a Navy man ! Probably from an old Navy family . Named for David Farragut and John Paul Jones ! " The exec paused for breath . " We 're going to really exploit this man , " he yelled . " Open up with the sixteen-inchers ! Flank speed ahead ! All engines wide open ! In other words , " he explained this to Griffin and Siegel , " we 'll use initiative ! Imagination ! The Typical Young Navy Man ! That 's the pitch I 'm taking on Jones . The Typical Naval Joe Blow ! " " Why , that 's what I 've always thought he was , " said Griffin , like a man coming out of shock . " That 's what I thought from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " repeated Siegel impassively . " That 's all , Sailors ! " the exec exclaimed . " Except I want to say : Well done ! Oh , and of course , " the exec added as an afterthought , " you 're released from confinement . " 117 MELORA 3Meier= 3HYDROZ TO JEREM " History . . . " the Tuluran girl said . " Do you happen to know how far the first automobile could go on a tank of gasoline , Mr. Siegel ? " Ensign Siegel stopped swabbing the blackboard and looked at the girl bent over the teacher 's desk behind him . " Not offhand , Miss Alba , " he said . " Put it on your list and I 'll get it for you to-morrow . " Siegel thought how formal they were with each other , even after a month of twice-weekly visits in the schoolhouse , which was the only place he ever saw her . " History . . . " she said . " Why was President McKinley assassinated , Mr. Siegel ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of any kind , Miss Alba , " Ensign Siegel said . " So he just got this feeling off his chest by shooting the head of the government . " " Thank you , I 'll mark that one off , " the girl said . " Literature ... What is a raven ? " " Literature ? " Siegel said quizzically . " We 've been reading Edgar Allan Poe , " she explained . " Oh , " Ensign Siegel said . He squeezed out the blackboard rag in the bucket of water and straightened up . " Well , a raven is a bird , a black bird , about so big " ? he laid the rag on the blackboardledge and held his hands apart ? " or so big . " He kept moving his hands back and forth from seagull to sparrow while she watched . " Well , how big , Mr. Siegel ? " she said . " Well , it 's so big , " Ensign Siegel said , moving his hands . " Mr. Siegel , I can see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little impatiently . " You 've got to be much more definite than that or they 'll push you right up against the wall and nail you to it . " " Sorry , Miss Alba , " Siegel apologized , finishing off the blackboard , picking up his broom and starting to sweep the room . He sighed heavily . " Put it on your list . I 'll look it up tomorrow . " Ensign Siegel and the schoolteacher Melora Alba were having one of their regular after-school sessions . The Tuluran girl had been making use of Ensign Siegel 's visits to help her in the lessons she gave her seventh-grade students . She needed help because she was in an odd position for a teacher . Her total tools were three textbook  --  geography , a modem history and a book of literature reading  --  hich had survived the pre-invasion shelling of the original schoolhouse . The teacher had been appalled to find out how wide open to the most elementary questions a lack of referencebooks left you . With Siegel 's help she had worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils asked questions she could n't answer , she took them down and told the pupils she would try to find out . Then , on Ensign Siegel 's next visit , she went over the list with him . The ones Siegel did n't kno  --  nd he was himself flabbergasted at how he could n't answer the most ridiculously simple questions , such as how does a refrigerator freeze ic  --  e looked up the next day in the wellstockedFleet Library , where he found himself spending more time than he had in any library since Widener . His next visit , two or three days later , he brought the answers to the girl and received a fresh batch . It was n't the best teaching system in the world , but it was the best they could do . Ensign Siegel had experienced a spectrum of emotions regardingthis task . At first it was a sort of duty . Then he became rather fascinated at looking up things like " Automobile , " " Cotton gin " and " Indians " in the Fleet Library 's reference books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as the questions from11S 119 MELORA 3the girl 's pupils gushed fort  --  t seemed that the more you satisfiedtheir curiosity the more ravenous it got , Siegel found greater and greater chunks of library time gouged out of his life . Ofttimes , while the other officers were frolicking at the bar with their rum sours , Siegel 's nose would be buried deep in the HYDROZ to JEREM volume of an encyclopedia as he sought the answer to some question on the internal combustion engine . Siegel not only had to read the whole long passage throug  --  t was astoundingthe space that an encyclopedia could devote to the internal combustion engin  --  ut he had to figure out an answer to the question in language a seventh-grader could understand . He began to weary slightly of this additional duty . But there was nothinghe could do about it if he wanted to keep seeing the Tuluran girl . Which meant there was nothing at all he could do about it . " Who are the members of the American Cabinet , Mr. Siegel ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stettinius ; War , Henry Stimson ; Navy , James Forrestal ; Interior , Harold Ickes ; Labor , Frances Perkins ; Commerce , Henry Wallace ; Agriculture , Clyde Wickard ; Treasury , Henry Morgenthau ; Attorney General , Francis Biddle ; PostmasterGeneral , Frank Walker , " Ensign Siegel rattled off , like a proud schoolboy , happy to have a question he could answer . The girl looked up in mild surprise . " Now , if you 'll give them to me a little more slowly , Mr. Siegel . . . " And Siegel , leaning on his broom , did . " How big is Brooklyn ? " the girl asked . Ensign Siegel 's big foreheadwrinkled . " One million . . . two million . Put it on your list , " he said helplessly . " How long is a dinosaur ? " the girl asked . " My God , " Siegel said as the girl looked at him reprovingly . " Put it on your list , " he said immediately . " What were the seven wonders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can think of the Colossus of Rhodes , the Pharos at Alexandria , the Tomb of Mausolus ... " " The Temple of Diana at Ephesus ... the Hanging Gardensof Babylon . . . " Siegel added , and then faltered . There was a silence of thought , Siegel leaning on his broom and the girl tappingher pencil against her chin . " The two missing wonders , " Siegel said disgustedly . " Put it on your list . " With brusque movements Ensign Siegel resumed his broom " The little creatures never stop , do they ? " he said . " Well , they 're children , " the teacher said comprehensively . Ensign Siegel finished his sweeping and stuck the broom in a corner . Then he got a dry rag and dusted down the desks . Then he took the blackboard water outside and emptied it , came back and stuck the bucket , the wet rag and the dry rag and the broom in a cleaning closet off to the side . He was happy to have taken on this work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his half-hour alone with her . Otherwise the children took turns staying after school and doing it , while their teacher correctedpapers . Both the ensign and the children considered the new arrangement a good deal . His chores done , Ensign Siegel took a seat at the pupil 's desk closest to the teacher 's desk . It was built for a twelve-year-old and he was obliged constantly to readjust his big frame in it . They made a strange pair sitting there . Ensign Max Siegel , a huge , ugly man . And the exquisitely formed Tuluran girl , whose beauty was an almost startling fact , with her flawless palomino skin , her long black hair . The girl finished her list and looked up at the shining blackboard , the swept room , the dusted desks . " You do a good job , Mr. Siegel , " she said . She smiled at the sight of the big ensign in the tiny desk . " Do n't fall out of that . And not just the cleaning , " she went on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . I never imagined how hard it would be to teach without books to look things up in . " " I 'm always glad to further the cause of education , Miss Alba , " Ensign Siegel said , shifting himself in the child 's seat . " Mr. Siegel , " " Miss Alba , " he thought . Apparently , he was120 121 MELORA 3thinking , for a Tuluran girl of her family to call him anything else before she had known him for at least five years would have been an act of familiarity on the order of a Back Bay debutante sitting on a young man 's lap at his introductory tea with her parents . " Mr. Siegel . " But still it was very , very nice to be here with her , whatever she called him . " Education needs furthering here , Mr. Siegel , " she said , with a rather discouraged smile , looking around the small , bare room . " I 'm glad your ships have such excellent marksmanship . But I do wish those particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makeshift school building , which had once been a storehouse , had to do for eight grades since the pre-invasion shelling . The girl had something close to a mania , Siegel thought , for getting a new schoolhouse . She seemed to him a quite easygoinggirl except when it came to one thin  --  ducation . Havingbeen educated herself , she seemed determined to have every other Tuluran educated . " Of course your ships had good reason for doing it , " the girl said . " After all , the Japanese were using the schoolhouse as a storage place for bombs . But it was a nice schoolhouse , " she added . " It 's hard to teach eight grades in one room . " " Well , you 'll get another schoolhouse after the war , " Siegel said , rearranging himself in the seat . The girl shook her head impatiently . " That is n't good enough .

" After the war all that schooling time will be lost forever . You never get that kind of loss back . I 'm sorry to sound angry , " she said abruptly . " Only we need things . I see the children and what they need and I ca n't help getting impatient sometimes . " " I know , " Ensign Siegel said . He sighed . " Maybe you should have spoken to those congressmen that day about it , Miss Alba . " The girl smiled suddenly , in spite of herself , remembering thatday . " You mean the day you gave me a husband and several children . Mr. Siegel ? " " Well , I had to rescue you , Miss Alba , " Ensign Siegel said , readjustinghimself in the child 's seat . " You 're so chivalrous , Mr. Siegel , " she said . " Next time some more of those congressmen come out , tell them we need a new schoolhouse , will you ? " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to be going now , Mr. Siegel . Here 's the new list . " " Oh , just a moment , Miss Alba , " Ensign Siegel said , leaping up . He took the list . " I have a present for yo  --  t 's outside in the jeep . " " A present ? " she said , quite formally . " Why , that 's very kind of you , Mr. Siegel , but I really could n't accept any present . " " But I sent clear to the States for it , " Ensign Siegel said , standing there , looking down at her . " The thought was very kind , Mr. Siegel , " she said , very correctly . " I 'm sorry . I ca n't accept a present from you . " " Well , you can at least look at it . After all , I did go to a lot of trouble getting this , Miss Alba , " Ensign Siegel said , quite stiffly himself . " I 'm sorry about that , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask you to . . . " " You did n't ask me to ? " Siegel said , a little inflamed . " Well , that 's just too bad . Now you 're going to look at this present , " he said firmly . " You just wait . " " Mr. Siegel , I ... " But Ensign Siegel had dashed out the door . In a few moments he was back , staggering under the weinht of a huge wooden box . He set it down with a heavy thump in the middle of the floor . " Now , Mr. Siegel , " the girl said , very firmly . " I ca n't accept a gift from you . Is that clear ? I know it 's different in America , but here girls are n't allowed to accept gifts from men ... " " Be quiet , Miss Alba , " Ensign Siegel said. 122 " Now , see here , Mr. Siegel , " she said severely . But he had dashed out again . He was back presently with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other box with a longshoremancrash . The two boxes now came to about her waist . Beforeshe could get out a word he pushed out again and brought in a third large box . He slammed it down by the other two . Thunderingout of the schoolhouse twice again , Siegel hefted in two more boxes . The five boxes now made quite a barricade in front of the teacher , whose anger was now being diluted with astonishment . Ensign Siegel , who was perspiring heavily from his labors , ran out once more . This time he returned with a crowbar and without a word started in on one of the boxes . Suddenly , with a loud screech , the top of the box flew open . Siegel dropped the crowbar resoundingly , and diving into the box with both hands , started throwing excelsior out right and left . Then he stood back . " Go ahead , Miss Alba ! " Ensign Siegel said . " Just look ! It does n't violate any Tuluran customs just to look , does it ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of tier obstreperous children . " All right , Mr. Siegel , " she said then , in tones of tried patience , and perhaps also her curiosity was beginning to get the better of her . " I 'll loo  --  ut that 's all , " she added stubbornly . Stepping over to the box , she peered cautiously inside as if afraid something was going to jump out of it . " Go ahead , Miss Alba ! " Ensign Siegel said . " It wo n't bite you ! Take one of them out ! " Hesitantly the girl reached with both hands into the box and lifted out a heavy object wrapped in thick brown paper . " Open it , Miss Alba ! " Ensign Siegel commanded . Slowly the girl tore the wrapper off . Suddenly she was staring incredulously at the object . Then the wrapper slipped out of her hands and fell to the floor . " Why , " she said in awe , " it 's the Encyclopedia Britannica ! " Ensign Siegel reached in his pocket , pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the volume she was holding . It was the BALTIM to BRAIN volume . " You can do your own homework now , " he said . Abruptly , hugging the big , shining , new volume to her with one arm , she reached down with her free hand and gave Ensign Siegel 's hand a quick squeeze . " The Encyclopedia Britannica ! " she said . " Oh , Max ! " 4Ultimate fraternizationYeoman Second Class Adam Garrett , who was Ensign Max Siegel 's yeoman , was a rangy , lean young man of twenty-two and as handsome as Siegel was ugly . His skin gleamed bronzely against his enlisted man 's whites and a shock of blond hair rose above a high-boned bronzed face and sea-blue eyes . His broad shoulders tapered down to a lean , flat-bellied waist , and all of him was leanness and muscle . Every movement of his body seemed rhythmic , effortlessly so . He radiated maleness , virile maleness , but he had no self-consciousness whatever about it , hardly awareness . He should have been a Viking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hind , or one of John Paul Jones ' men on the Bon Homme Richard . Instead he was a yeomanwho typed up correspondents ' travel orders . Yeoman Garrett was an entirely easygoing young man who spent a good deal of time reading from the Fleet Library , which126 127 Ultimate fraternizationwas one of the best west of Widener . He had one enormous passion , which was to get out on a ship . He and Siegel liked each other . From Yeoman Garrett 's side , Siegel was virtually the only officer in the place for whom he had the slightest respect , and his admiration for Siegel was complete to the point of extravagance . This feeling originated in two element  --  e considered Siegel , as a man who had had sea duty , about the only true officer there . And he considered him a man . Ensign Siegel , for his part , appreciated what he knew to be Garrett'svery real desire to be out on a ship . One time when Siegel asked him , Garrett explained why . " Why , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his arm , Garrett indicated the large Media room , with its batteries of desks , typewriters and filing cabinets , the correspondents ' room from which the cacophony of typewriters and raucous talk could be heard , the adjoining auxiliary Public Relations buildings outside the screened windows . His gesture seemed to take in the whole meaning of the place to him . " My God , sir , " he said in one of his few fervent moments , " I want to be able to look people in the eye after the war ! " Ensign Siegel wanted very much to get Garrett sprung . But getting out of Tulura onto a naval vessel was harder than for a battleship to steam through the eye of a needle . And with some reason , as Siegel tried to explain to his yeoman . " It would look funny as hell , " he said , " if the exec let you go right at the time he 's asked Washington for thirty-five more yeo-men . " " Thirty-five ! " Garrett exclaimed . " What the hell are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , " Siegel explained . " We 've got another shipment of chairs coming . " Ensign Siegel , with Garrett 's concurrence , soon laid down a plan . This was to wait until Washington acted on the exec 's manpowerreques  --  hen to ask for sea duty for Garrett . The arrival of thirty-five new yeomen would give him a certain arguing point , Siegel figured . As it was , there were no arguing points with the exec , despite the prevailing idleness of most of the yeomen alreadyaboard . The last man who asked for sea duty had ended up in the psycho ward of the Fleet Hospital . Lieutenant CommanderNash had a perfectly reasonable explanation for sending him there . " There must be something wrong up here , " the exec said , tappinghis bald head , " with any man who would prefer some old tossing tub to the lovely duty we enjoy at Public Relations Headquartershere . Besides that , the man should have realized how vitally we need every man we can get and not be so selfish as to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who by philosophy believed in making the calm , relaxed best of his situation , contented himself with going through the shelves of the Fleet Library . He was probably the only man on Tulura who ever checked The Confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau , Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason , and Nietzsche 's Thus Spake Zarathustra out of the library . Once when Ensign Siegel came into the Media Section and stopped to talk with Garrett at the yeoman 's desk in front of his , he noticed that the book was Veblen 's The Theory of the Leisure Class . " Doing a little professional reading , I see , " Ensign Siegel observed . " It 's all about Tulura , " Yeoman Garrett said . One day Yeoman Garrett was approached by Lieutenant ( jg ) Ross Pendleton with an interesting proposition . Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton was a man accustomed to doing everything on the grand scale . " There are two ways to live , " Pendleton used to say . " A man has a choice in this world . He can earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , eat steaks Chateaubriand , drink Chivas Regal and get his central heating from the prime ribs of Hollywood . Or he can be what a man like Griffin here is . Small time . " " I made sixty dollars a week , " Lieutenant Morey Griffin said , izs 1 29 Ultimate fraternizationframing his words carefully , " and I 've heard it said by others that I was one of the best rewrite men in San Francisco . It was an honest way , in any case , of making a living . Conversing with you and learning that fact which you drill into us so often , Ross , that you dragged twenty thousand a yea  --  discount everything radio people say by hal  --  s a perfect proof of how dissolute radio is . No self-respecting newspaper would hire you as a copyboy . " " You 're just small time , Griffin , " Pendleton replied . " You alwayswere and always will be small time . It 's a free country and there 's nothing to stop a small-time man from earning sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why the rigors of war , or at least of Tulura , should interfere with his concept of living . He was the Public Relations IIeadquarters ' best drinking man and his preferreddrink was the martini . For some reason , probably in the interests of getting on with the war , gin was the only beverage not in supply at the officers ' club . But Ross managed to get regularshipments of gin and vermouth through a pilot who made the run to Honolulu . He also kept his private cellar well supplied by making fast friends , it was believed on a vague promise of postwar radio employment , with the one non-drinking officer in Headquarters , a practicing Christian Scientist , and taking his monthly rations off his hands . Regularly once a week a large package from Pendleton 's wife arrived on Tulura , containing one non-edible ite  --  exana heat powde  --  nd otherwise crowded with such interesting delicacies as pate de foie gras , pearl onions , Smithfield ham , small cured cheeses , tins of boneless Portuguese sardines and Swedish marinatedherring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cocktail sausage  --  n assortment which providedfirst-rate materiel for the frequent twosome picnics Ross undertook to secluded beaches with various of his nurse companions in his ample leisure time . Ross was the only officer at Headquarterswho actually had a selection of women , which were his hobby much as some men collect postage stamps . I-le used toname famous Hollywood and radio names he 'd slept with , and seeing him operate on Tulura , the accounts could be believed . He looked the type , and with his wavy black hair and suave manner which seemed incapable of being ruffled , was attractive and goodlookingin a Radio City sort of way . Besides , he was of a profession , huckstering , traditionally successful with women . He was a great name dropper . " Did I ever tell you about the time I slept with , " he said , naming an international household word famous for her **29;10167;TOOLONG . Then he would relate at length all the details , including what Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton referred to as " the moment of truth " ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie star to desire-crazed female . At these times Morey Griffin , writhing in torture , threatened to put a bullet through his , Pendleton 's , head if he did n't stop . Griffin alwaystold Pendleton he did n't believe a word of it , but when Pendleton was n't there , Morey admitted : " The tragedy of it is that the son of a bitch has actually probably laid half of Hollywood . Why , all you have to do is watch him her  --  ' ll swear to God I 'll bet he 's slept with most of the women on Tulura . " In peacetime Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton had never felt the slightest impulse to restrict his charms to one individual woman , and even on Tulura he saw no reason to start being selfish . Increasinglyof late , however , he had been aiming the bulk of his efforts at one nurse . Her name was Ensign Alice Thomas and she pursued her temporary naval career in the Fleet Hospital eighteen miles on the other side of the island from Public Relations Headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and time he was beginning to devote to this one woman , the other officers concluded from this fact alone that Ensign Thomas must really have something . Whatever it was certainly was not at all overwhelmingly apparent . She was a pretty little thing but not , from any appearancesof manner or conversation , a great deal more . She seemed 130 a quite average , unthinking , normally extrovertish American girl . She was rather saucy , even haughty at times , with eyes that said she knew exactly what she wanted and that this was the hunting seaso  --  he would never land a Ross Pendleton back in her job at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan . To anyone else in the Pacific she would probably have appeared endowed with the charms of Cleopatra , but it was something of a mystery why Pendleton , with his rich sources of women even in the Pacific , should be giving her such a whirl . It was not long after he had begun to concentrate so heavily on Ensign Thomas that Pendleton made his proposition to Yeoman Garrett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to do convoy duty when I have a dat  --  ack the old .45 ? " There was an order on Tulura that no nurse could be taken out by an officer unless accompanied by a third , armed officer . This was for the protection of the nurse against the few Japs still in the bushes , though some claimed it was for the protection of the nurse against her date . Garrett had some reason for being quite surprised at the offer from Pendleton . " Well , sir , " he said , " that 's a very interesting suggestion . But the rule , I believe , says that you have to have an armed officer along . " And Garrett pointed a forefinger at his yeoman 's stripes . " Oh , do n't bother about that , " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton said . " I 've fixed all that with Clinton . " " Clinton ? " Garrett said , perplexed . " Commander Nash , " explained Pendleton , who would have first-named the President . " He said if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton did not mention to Garrett his rea- sons for preferring an enlisted man to an officer as the escort on his dates , though Garrett had a good guess . The reason , of course , was to prevent any other officer from casting lustful eyes or more on Ensign Thomas . With an enlisted man the protection on this count was as foolproof and secure as having a eunuch , under the 131 Ultimate fraternizationancient , unquestioned , non-fraternizing Navy code that an enlisted man can not date an officer . For a Navy enlisted man to cast lustful eyes on a Navy nurse , or at least to attempt to do anything about it , is as forbidden and as dangerous as for the Sultan 's batman to essay a similar course with his master 's favorite haremgirl . " Naturally , Garrett , " Pendleton went on suavely , " I would n't expect you to do this for nothing . There 's something in it for you . " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton leaned forward confidentially . " A bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the Pacific , whose only alcoholic beveragewas beer , and a limited amount of that , this was golden payment , even though it was little strain on Pendleton with his extraliquor sources . Garrett was properly appreciative . " I get more interested by the second , Mr. Pendleton , " he said . " I thought you would , " Pendleton said . " However , before we close the deal there are one or two rather important details to get settled . " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton straightened up in his chair . " There will be times , Garrett , " he explained carefully , " when I 'll want you to make yourself scarce . I do n't want any Peeping Toms around when I 'm telling Alice good nigh  --  r , I hope " ? Pendletongrinned lecherously ? " showing her the beach by moonlight . In a word , I do n't like voyeurs . You know what the word means and is that clear ? " " Affirmative on both counts , sir , " Garrett said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly . " Well , that 's hardly necessary . However , I 'm glad to see you catch the spirit of the thing . Never mind the blinkers but do keep your eyes in the opposite direc-tion . " " I wo n't observe it , " Garrett said , slightly emphasizing the last word . " I 'm glad to see you catch the spirit of the thing . Also , " Pendletonsaid , " there is one other item of extreme importance . You are132 133 Ultimate fraternizationnot , " Pendleton said , framing his words with incisive clarity , " to tell her that I 'm married . I have an instinct that Ensign Thomas has one of those old-fashioned blind spots about dating married men that you occasionally run into in a woman . And to put it perfectly frankly , something you might want to remember yourself , Garrett " ? Pendleton spoke in the tones of an expert ? " I have a rule of thumb in these things which is , What they do n't know wo n't hurt me . ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent , " Yeoman Garrett said . " I doubt if there 'll be an opportunit  --  mean occasio  --  or me to have two words with her , but if I do it 'll be about when the war is going to he over . " " That 's a safe enough subject , " Pendleton said . " Well , shall we consider that we 've come to an understanding ? " " I 'm all for it , " Yeoman Garrett said . " And I hope , " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton said , closing the deal , " that you enjoy the Paul Jones as much , heh , heh , " he laughed lecherously , " as I hope to enjoy Ensign Thomas . Good deal for both of us , eh , Garrett , old man ? " " Sir , " Garrett said , " it looks like we 've both got it made . " " Got it made , ' " echoed Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton , with a glossy laugh . " I could n't put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my end . " Almost every night Yeoman Garrett would check out a jeep and a .45 and drop by the BOQ for Pendleton . From there the two would drive the eighteen miles across the island to the Fleet Hospital . While Garrett waited in the jeep , Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendletonwould go in and pick up his date . When they emerged from the hospital , Garrett would get out of the jeep , come to attention and smartly salute Ensign Thomas . Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton and Ensign Thomas would sometimes go to the hospital officers ' club and pass the evening drinking or attending a dance there , while Garrett waited outside in the jeep or went over and shot the breeze with some of the hospital corpsmen . Usually he would drive the two officers back to the ComFleets officers ' club . Yeoman Garrett had been convoying Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendletonand Ensign Thomas for some three weeks when he told his own officer , Ensign Siegel , that he had something he had to talk to him about . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point ? " it 's beginning to get on my nerves . Smelling her perfume , watching her part her lips to put on lipstick , watching her little teeth the way she smiles , and her little tongue , watching the way she smoothes her hair back , watching the way she crosses her legs ? all this out of the corner of my ey  --  earing the rustling .. " " For Christ 's sake , Garrett , " Siegel said . " Believe me , sir , I earn that fifth ! " Yeoman Garrett exclaimed suddenly . " I need it when I 'm through ! " Siegel looked in utter dumfoundment at the animated yeoman . He was flabbergasted to hear this outburst from a man whose easygoing calm he had never seen disturbed . " It 's really beginning to get on my nerves , " Garrett repeated , rubbing his hand through his shock of blond hair . " Well , why in the hell do n't you simply tell Pendleton to get someone else ? " Ensign Siegel said . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do that ! I mean , I think night and day about her . It 's torture to be with he  --  ith the  --  ut it 's even more torture when I 'm not ! I live for the time when Mr. Pendleton will have another date with her ! " Before long Yeoman Garrett found himself taking Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton and Ensign Thomas , not to one of the officers ' clubs for drinking or dancing , but , the two officers sitting in the back seat of the jeep , just for a drive . As Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton'sattentions to Ensign Thomas made progress , Yeoman Garrett'susual equanimity retrogressed in almost exact ratio . It was not too many nights longer before , the day after one of them , Yeoman Garrett asked Ensign Siegel if he could talk with him again . " Mr. Siegel , " the yeoman said , " now we 're to the point where I 'm sitting in the goddamn jeep while she and Mr. Pendleton , 134 135 Ultimate fraternizationsaying they 're going for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Thirty paces away ! God , I can almost hear them , my ears are straining so ! It 's almost more than a man can take , Mr. Siegel ! " " Now , Garrett . Maybe they are taking a walk , " Ensign Siegel said in an effort to be reassuring . " How do you kno  --  hy , you ca n't see them , you said yourself . " " How do I know ! " Garrett exclaimed with abrupt violence . " Mr. Pendleton told me , that 's how I know ! Last night , after we 'd dropped Ensign Thomas at the Fleet Hospital about one A.M. and were driving back here ! Well , Garrett , ' he said , smiling like a tomcat , I finally made it . ' Then he started in telling me how it wa  --  ll the eighteen miles back to here he kept giving me all the exact details of exactly how it was ! Smiling like a tomcat ! That 's how I know ! " Ensign Siegel was alarmed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know something else , sir ? " Garrett said in sudden outrage . " Mr. Pendleton has n't even told her he 's married ! " " Now , Garrett , " Siegel said . " You 're not getting moralistic about this , are you ? " " Why , it 's obvious to anyone what she is to him ! " Garrett exploded . " She 's just a lay to him . Nothing but a lay ! " " Well , I 'm glad your own interests in the young lady are of such a higher order , " Ensign Siegel said . " Such as the way she crosses her legs . " Garrett 's mind had soon formulated an odd rationale concerning the obvious relationship to which Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton and Ensign Thomas had now arrived . The rationale was that it was all Pendleton 's fault . Yeoman Garrett cast Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton in the role of the seducing huckster and Ensign Thomas in that of the glamor-struck but innocent girl just come to the big city . The Pendleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part would have seemed , at best , to be highly questionable . It overlooked the obvious fact thatEnsign Thomas knew , and knew Garrett knew , the purpose of the jeep rides which continued almost every night of the week now . One did n't go jeep-riding along the most deserted roads on Tulura , which were selected ahead of time by Pendleton and passed on to Garrett , for the scenery . In the black boondocks it was impossible to see anything at night anyhow . It entirely overlookedthe audible boldness on the part of the nurse when , from the back seat , Garrett would hear the articulations of preliminary love . And the boldness even more when Pendleton , as they reached some beach , at last spoke . " Oh , say , Garrett . Why do n't we pull up here , son ? I think Ensign Thomas might like to see the beach . " And Ensign Thomas would giggle , and the two officers would disappear and see the beach for an hour or so while Garrettwaited miserably in the jeep . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ensign Thomas as innocent , if not technicallyas pure , as the driven snow . " Mr. Pendleton , " Garrett exclaimed one day to Ensign Siegel , " why , he '  --  e 's just a Radio City glamor boy , you know that yourself , sir ! And her . Well , sir , I think he takes advantage of her ! " " That 's a very admirable , protective attitude , Garrett , " Siegel said . " And I hate to disillusion you . But most Navy nurses I 've had the privilege of knowing can take care of themselves , if they happen to feel like taking care of themselves , even with Radio City glamor boys . I doubt that Pendleton has to take her at gun-point . " Garrett rubbed his hand across his forehead . " But , sir ! She 's such a nice girl . " Ensign Siegel looked for a long moment at his yeoman . " Garrett , " he said , " how long since you had a woman ? " Garrett waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said miserably . " I 've been two years in the Pacific . " " Man , " said Ensign Siegel , " Battleship Mary would look nice to you right now . " 1 36 " Maybe so , Mr. Siegel , " the yeoman said miserably . " I do n't know . I do n't know anything any more . Probably you 're right . Probably it 's just plain sex . But . . . " Garrett looked across suddenly at the ensign . " But you know something else on that very point , sir ? I think she likes me . Lately I caught her looking at me once or twice when Mr. Pendleton was n't watching . Least I thought I did . Probably wishful think- ing , " the yeoman added bitterly . One night something happened that made Yeoman Garrett de- cide it was really no longer bearable for him . " Last night , Mr. Siegel , " Garrett told his officer , " we stopped at what looked like a usable beach but just to make sure Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time w  --  nsign Thomas and I , that i  --  ad ever been alone . We were alone for about five minutes . There I was , sitting in the front scat , and there she was , sitting in the back scat . " " What the hell happened ? " Siegel said impatiently . " Nothing ! " Yeoman Garrett said . " That 's just it . Not a thing happened . " Garrett buried his head in his hands . " However , maybe something did happen . I 'm to the point where the slight- est thing , if it concerns her , has significance to me . Maybe if I told you about it , you could give me your interpretation . " " For God 's sake , what was it ? " Siegel said . " Well , " Garrett sighed heavily . " We were sitting there , Ensign Thomas and me . For the first minute or two after Mr. Pendleton had gone neither of us said a word . You know how quiet it can get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quietness , al- most terrifying . And so black you could n't see a thing . I prob- ably could n't have seen her if I turned around . I did n't turn around but I certainly knew she was there . . . " " Garrett , if you do n't get on with this , " Siegel said , " I 'm going to be sent to Portsmouth Naval Prison for striking an enlisted man . " " I was just trying to give you the setting , sir . " " I 've got the goddamn setting , " Siegel said . " What happened ? " 1 37 Ultimate fraternization " Well , as I say , neither of us said a word for about two minutes . Then I heard her speak . I guess it was the first word she had ever spoken to me . " " What did she say ? ' Now it 's your turn , Buster ' ? " " By God , Mr. Siegel ! " Garrett said angrily . " You 're as bad as Mr. Pendleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is n't like that , " Garrett protested . " I know , " Siegel said wearily . " All right , let 's try once more . What , " Ensign Siegel almost shouted , " happened ? " " Mr. Siegel , I did n't mean that about your being as bad as Mr. Pendleton , " Garrett said . " I lost my temper . " " Garrett , for Christ 's sake , what happened ? What did she say ? " " She said . " Garrett said , and breathed a long , deep breath . " She said , ' Garrett , I just want you to know that I realize this is a little hard on you . ' " " The bitch ! " Ensign Siegel exploded . " Christ Al-mighty ! ' I realizethis is a little hard on you . ' " Siegel mimicked his idea of a nurse 's voice . " Jesus Holy Christ Almighty , Garrett ! " Siegel said . " Why in the world do you want to go drooling off after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , Mr. Siegel ! " Garrett cried out . " She is n't like that at all . You know what that remark told me about her ? " " The way your mind is functioning , " Ensign Siegel said , " I do n't have the faintest idea . " " It means she has a sense of humanity , " Garrett said . " She thought about what all this was doing to me . " Ensign Siegel looked directly at Garrett a long time , then sighed , a deep , heavy sigh . " Well , Garrett , I do n't have a thing to say . I do n't think you have enough judgment left to distinguish between the motives of Joan of Arc and Madame Bovary . " " And I ca n't even date her ! " Yeoman Garrett cried out . " No matter how we felt , I ca n't even date her . " " It 's probably the most ancient of Navy rules , " Siegel said . " The138 ' 39 Ultimate fraternizationlast vestiges of discipline would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Siegel ! " Garrett exploded . " I know , " Siegel said wearily . " Please do n't tell me any more how Pendleton 's raping her every night on the beach . " " Mr. Siegel ! " Garrett said in outrage . Then Yeoman Garrett went limp . All of him seemed to sag in his chair . He buried his head in his hands and slowly , over and over again , he rubbed his hand across his forehead . " Mr. Siegel , I 'm going nuts ! I ca n't date her ! They wo n't let me date her ! " the yeoman cried passionately . Ensign Siegel , looking at his bent-over yeoman , thought of the traditional Navy rule against an enlisted man dating a nurse , the nurse being quite naturally an officer , rather than a woman , as far as the Navy was concerned . his eyes rested idly on the row of four clocks on the wall which gave the time in San Francisco , Denver , Chicago and New York . The clocks were there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pastime of sitting and watching them and wondering what the people in those cities were doing right now . In Chicago , he noticed , it was seven P.M. People were getting ready to go out on dates . As his eyes rested back on Garrett , something quite basic occurred to Ensign Siegel . If the processes of unnautical natural selection were permitted to take their course , he thought , any woman worthy of that title would deeply prefer Yeoman Second Class Adam Garrett to LieutenantJunior Grade Ross Pendleton . " Garrett , " he said abruptly , " see if you can hold out for a few more day  --  mean nights . Do you think you can do that ? " " What she said , " Yeoman Garrett , who had not heard the officer , said desperately , " I 'll never forget it . I just want you to know that I realize this is a little hard on you . ' Nobody but a woman full of humanity could ever make a remark like that ! " It was two nights later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill through Public Relations Headquarters and for afew days the letters home had the quality of having been written from the D-day beaches of Iwo Jima . A real banzai attack on Tulura ! Of all places . The attack was made on Lieutenant ( jg ) Ross Pendleton , EnsignAlice Thomas and Yeoman Second Class Adam Garrett . It occurred on the eighteen-mile road which led from Public RelationsHeadquarters to the Fleet Hospital , following the sea for the most part . On those exposed stretches no Jap could have got at anyone even if he 'd cared to . But at two or three points there were long rocky promontories which had forced the Seabees who built the road to cut it through thick jungle , no longer than a mile in any one stretch . It was in one of these jungle stretches that the Japs attacked . It was a moonless night . Yeoman Garrett was cruising the jeep at only about fifteen miles an hour , his passengers warming up for a certain operating ground down the way , with a certain convenientand flat rock above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often stopped . Garrett was listening to the mufRednoises from the back seat , when suddenly a rifle shot cracked the still night . Ensign Thomas screamed . Simultaneously a hissing noise escaped from aft the three passengers . A tire had been hit . " Take her through ! " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton shouted at Garrett . " Give her the gun ! " Garrett jammed down the accelerator , with the result that Ensign Thomas was almost thrown from the vehicle , which was now ridingon a rim . " For God 's sake , Ross ! " she screamed . Another rifle shot barked , followed by another hiss of air . The jeep was now rocking like a destroyer in a typhoon . Nevertheless Pendleton ordered Garrett to keep course . " Take her through ! " he shouted in tones of command . " Stop , for God 's sake ! " Ensign Thomas screamed hysterically . " You 'll kill us all , Ross ! " " It 's Japs ! " Pendleton yelled . " Hold on , honey ! We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep expired and stopped on its own . A jeep could probably ride along on the rims , but one rim had been mangled by the second shot . " Hit the ditch ! " Pendleton chattered . Ensign Thomas was out of the jeep and into the ditch and Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton and Yeoman Garrett joined her , all three crouching low in the ravine . The nurse kept whimpering like a cold kitten , and Pendleton was no more help , his shaking voice jerking out various tactical maneuvers . " Listen , Garrett ! You go one way and I 'll go the other , and we 'll encircle them . " " And leave me here ! " Ensign Thomas squealed . " You wo n't do any such thing ! Oh , Garrett , I 'm scared ! " Pendleton looked sharply down at the nurse for addressing her fear to Garrett , instead of himself , and placed his arm assertively around her . She drew up against him . " Garrett 's got the gun , " Ensign Thomas explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , Garrett , " Pendletonsaid . " After all , I am senior in command here . " Pendleton said this so weakly , however , that Garrett chose to disregard it . Pendleton did n't want the gun anyhow , never having fired a .45 , and Ile did n't mention his command status again . The three naval personnel crouched and waited in the black stillness where the thickness of the jungle rose close and menacing around them . " Why does n't something happen ? " Ensign Thomas shrieked . It was as if the scream were the signal for a banzai . Suddenly almostat their backs came a medley of terror-striking yells of many men : " Yankee soljer , you die ! " just like the Japs did it , as Pendletonhad heard in the radio broadcasts which he arranged . A score of small , Jap-sized shadows sprang from the bushes . A wild melee followed , with the girl 's shriekings , Pendleton 's yells " Go away ! Go away ! " addressed to the shadows racing toward them , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Ensign Thomas was horrified to see several of the figures pounce on Pendleton . Moving fleet as weasels they threw a blanket over14 Ultimate fraternizationthe lieutenant junior grade 's head , stifling his yells , and dragged him back into the jungle . They did not touch Ensign Thomas or Yeoman Second Class Garrett , who were now alone in the black night . " Oh , poor Ross ! " the nurse sobbed , her head in her hands . " Poor Ross ! Why did they take just him , Garrett ? Why ? " Yeoman Garrett shrugged . " I do n't know , ma'a  --  enior in command , I guess . " Ensign Thomas was hysterical enough to believe almost anything , but this sounded strange and she took her head out of her hands and looked up at Garrett . " Why , that 's silly ! They could n't tell . " " Could n't they ? They could certainly tell the difference betweenthis pajama suit " ? Garrett indicated his enlisted man 's clothing ? " and an officer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ensign Thomas said . But she repeated , " Oh , why did they take poor Ross ? " " Hostage . They probably want him for a hostage . Anyhow , I do n't think we should stand here and philosophize about it , ma'am . Frankly , ma'am , I think we better get the hell out of here . " " Yes , let 's go for some help for poor Ross , " Ensign Thomas said . Yeoman Garrett and Ensign Thomas started walking clown the road , choosing the way that led toward the Fleet IIospital . They figured they could be no more than six miles away and this was the last stretch of jungle . In the black night with the boondocks close on them from both sides , Ensign Thomas kept whimpering and looking over her shoulder . She gave a great sigh of relief when they emerged from the jungle and the road went along the sea again . " Oh , Garrett , I 'm so tired ! " Ensign Thomas said . " I know a rock ledge over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yeoman Garrett said matter-of-factly . " I 'm so tired ! " Ensign Thomas repeated . " Do you think it would matter if we sat down and rested a moment before going for help ? Or do you think we should go on right now ? " 142 " Well , I do n't think it would hurt to rest just for a moment , " Yeoman Garrett said judiciously . Angling off the road , they found the ledge that jutted out above the sea , which was hitting in perhaps thirty feet below them . Suddenly the nurse buried her head in her hands , sobbing , " Poor Ross . Oh , Garrett ! " " I 'm sorry you 're so upset , ma'am , " Garrett said formally . " And I 'm sorry to be such a crybaby , " Ensign Thomas said . " Not a very good example for an officer to set with an enlisted man , is it ? " " I would n't let that worry me , ma'am , " Garrett said . " After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ensign Thomas looked up at Garrett . " However , " she said , " I 'm also a naval officer . " " Yes , ma'am , " Garrett said formally . " So there ! " Ensign Thomas said . " I 'll just stop crying . There ! I 've stopped . " The yeoman and the ensign sat a moment listening to the sea , which , though so near , they could not see through the night 's blackness , but could hear washing the rocks below them . " Is n't it strange ? " Ensign Thomas said . " I mean the way you ca n't see a thing . I have such a strange feeling , Garrett . It 's so dark I ca n't even see you . " " I ca n't see you either , " Garrett said . " But I can tell you 're there . I can smell your perfume . " " Oh , " Ensign Thomas said rather crisply . " We better be going , Garrett . " She had started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you love him ? " There was a long , cold silence on the rock . " Garrett , " Ensign Thomas said quite crisply then , " that 's not a very proper question , is it ? " " No , it is n't , " Garrett apologized . " I 'm sorry , ma'am . It 's none of my business , " the yeoman said . He was miserable . " I 'm sorry I asked it . " 143 Ultimate fraternizationGarrett heard the ensign move a little on the rock . " That 's all right , " she said , less officerlike . She waited a moment . " Do you have anyone out here . . . Oh , I 'm sorry . " " Do n't mind it , ma'am , " Yeoman Garrett said . " It 's an old Navy rule . " " Oh , I am sorry ! " Ensign Thomas said . " How thoughtless of me ! " she put it . " Because , " she said hesitantly , " you . . . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " How long have you bee  --  ut here ? " " Two years in the Pacific , ma'am , " Garrett said . He could feel his heart pounding . " Two years ! " Ensign Thomas said . There was a sudden pity in her voice . " What a long time without ... " " You have no idea , ma'am , " Yeoman Garrett said . His whole body seemed to project toward her , everything that he was as a man , all the Pacific 's deprivation of his manhood . While Ensign Thomas , though feeling a detached pity , otherwise felt that calmness which those for whom it was not two years , but one night ago , can so richly afford . " Well , we better be going , Garrett , " she said . " We really had . " " They probably wo n't do a thing to Mr. Pendleton ! " Garrett said with urgent reassurance . " They undoubtedly just wanted the jeep . " " Maybe so , " Ensign Thomas said . " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , let 's go , " she said firmly . " Oh , ma'am , " Garrett suddenly burst out . " You do n't know how miserable I 've been these past few weeks ! I 've gone almost crazy ! Being around you . Looking at you ! Watching you smile ! The sounds of you , the smells of you ! Oh , ma'am ! You do n't know the hell I 've been through ! It 's like the worst kind of torture ! I ca n't sleep for thinking about you . I wake up looking at you . The littlest thing about you makes everything jump up and down inside me . The way you brush your hair back with your hand , watching you part your lips to put on lipstick , watching144 ' 45 Ultimate fraternization .. . Oh , ma'am , you 're a naval officer , I know . But you 're a woman , too . . . " Suddenly Yeoman Garrett stopped . In a terrible realization , it came over him . He was crawling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of himself over the past few weeks . Panting , babbling , drooling , and now , finally , right on this rock in front of her , like a dog sitting up for a bone , almost wagging his tail ! A wave of self-loathing engulfed him . He hated himself . He hated Ensign Thomas . He hated being here . He hated everything about it . A convulsion of fury and violence seized him . Abruptly he turned savagely on the rock toward Ensign Thomas . So beside himself was he that he forgot the rank-infested danger , and a torrentof rage emptied from him . " None of this raid happened tonight , " he said savagely . " You understand that ? It was all a fraud . From beginning to end it was a fraud ! A put-up job ! A fake ! You understand ? Those Daps ' were Tulurans . You understand that ? " he said viciously . " The whole thing was arranged . You understand , Ensign Thomas ? A fraud ! A fake ! " Ensign Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The raid did n't really happen ? " she said slowly , incredulously , " You mean . . . it was all . . . so you could ... " " Come on ! " Yeoman Garrett shouted in a spasm of rage . " Let 's get the hell out of her  --  a'am ! " he added , hurling the word bitterlyat the ensign . " Let 's go get some help for poor Ross ! " ' With a furious push against the rock , Yeoman Garrett was on his feet and starting away . Not a sound came from Ensign Thomas . " Come on ! " he barked . He stood there trembling with rage . " Get the hell up , Ensign Thomas , and let 's go ! " Suddenly , in a moment of sanity , he realized the enormity of the evenin  --  he way he , an enlisted man , was talking to one naval officer , how he had arranged the abduction of another navalofficer . In a moment of absolute terror he saw a vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then his fury rushed back into him . The hell with it ! he thought . Let them send me to Portsmouth ! " God damn it , did n't you hear me ! " he shouted down to EnsignThomas . " I said come on ! " There was a soft rustling movement from the rock . And suddenly a hand touched his face . It froze him . The hand , which was incredibly soft , began to move across his face . The tips of the fingers touched his nose , his cheeks , along his ear , his lips , slipped down around his neck . Yeoman Garrett felt he would swoon away . " Oh , ma'am ! " he said in a sudden wail , all of his self-respecting fury gone like the sheerest wisp of cloud . " Adam , " Ensign Thomas said . " Oh , ma'am ! " Yeoman Garrett said . " Stop calling me ma'am , " Ensign Thomas said , her voice a whisper . Then Yeoman Garrett felt a small hand taking hold of his . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers along her throat . He felt her hands make a couple of quick movements . Then he felt two small objects being placed in his hand . " Throw them away , Adam , " she said . With a flick of his fingers Yeoman Garrett sent first one , then the other , over the side of the ledge . The ensign 's bars made two small clinks on the rocks below . Near dawn next day a company of Marines was dispatched into the stretch of jungle where Pendleton had been taken . They never found anything . Pendleton himself wandered in later that morning , with a swaggering wild-eyed tale of being held captive and blindfolded all night long . He said he guessed the Japs were after the jeep . He and Garrett were sort of heroes around Public Relations Headquarters for a few days and as a matter of fact16some of the officers went over and got the Seabees to knock out a couple of huge tin medals bearing the legend : " Second Battle of Tulura . " That afternoon Ensign Siegel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's service store . " Well , did it go ? " Siegel asked . Yeoman Garrett was silent a moment , a silence of delicacy . " It went , " he said quietly then , in such a manner that Siegel realized the man was in some sort of daze . " I thought it would , " Siegel said drily . " She 's got so much humanity . " " Oh , indeed she does , sir , " said Garrett , on whom anything but adoration for Ensign Thomas was now lost . They waited for a jeep to pass , then crossed the road . " Those Tulurans ! " Siegel said with abrupt enthusiasm . " I tell you , they 're a great people . So adaptable . " Garrett seemed suddenly miserable . " I know , sir , " he said , " but I was just thinking . Even if they are your friends , we ca n't have them pull off a raid every night , can we ? " " No , I suppose not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen or so of them . However , now that we 've started this historic violation of Navy manners , we ca n't chicken out and stop , can we ? " " I could n't stop and still live , " Garrett said dazedly . " I 'm in love ! " " Yes , I know , " Ensign Siegel said with a patient sigh . " Just remember , you 've been in the Pacific two years . " Shortly after that a development that rocked the officers of the Public Relations Headquarters took place . Ensign Alice Thomas stopped dating the glamor-glazed Lieutenant ( jg ) Ross Pendleton . No one was more astounded than Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendletonthat any woman would voluntarily give him up . After that Ensign Thomas was seen occasionally with Ensign Max Siege . The very idea that any woman who had enjoyed the priceles.s147 Ultimate fraternizationprivilege of his company could spend five minutes with Siegel so infuriated Pendleton that he almost stopped speaking to his fellowofficer . " Ross " ? Siegel tried to make Pendleton feel better ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hurt ! " Pendleton bellowed , enraged at the adjective . " These things happen all the time , " Siegel continued benignly . " Besides , you 've got practically every other woman on the island sewn up . You can afford to be generous and let old Siegel have a date once in a while with Alice . " " Take her ! Take her ! " Pendleton said furiously . " Take the slut ! " " Careful there , old man , " Siegel said . " You 're speaking of the woman I might love . " Siegel let his eyes glow lecherously . " My , what a lovely slut she is . " " I 'm warning you , " Pendleton said ominously . " Ross , old man , " Siegel said , settling a detail , " you do n't mind if I use Garrett for the convoy duty , do you ? You 've broken him in , and after all he is my yeoman . " " You can use ComFleets as far as I 'm concerned ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slut is your own business . " " Ross , it 's wonderful of you to be so big about this , " Ensign Siegel said graciously . Suddenly Pendleton 's eyes widened in an idea . " Max , " he said in friendly tones , " I feel I ought to warn you that she 's a very calculatingwoman . " " Why , thanks for mentioning that , old boy , " Siegel said gratefully . " However , I 'll take my chances . In the Pacific a man would take his chances on Lucrezia Borgia herself . " " Okay , you son of a bitch , " Pendleton said . When Siegel and the .45-armed Garrett went over to the Fleet hospital on the other side of the island , Garrett would wait outsidewhile Ensign Siegel entered the hospital and picked Ensign Thomas up . As the two officers came out of the hospital , Garrett , standing by the jeep , would snap to attention and salute the148 149 Ultimate fraternizationnurse . Then she and Ensign Siegel would get in the back seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's wheel and drive the two ensigns to some deserted road . From his experience with Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton and Ensign Thomas , YeomanGarrett knew like the back of his hand all the deserted roads on Tulura . By now night would be falling and Yeoman Garrett would pull the jeep up alongside the road . He would get out of the jeep . From the back Ensign Siegel would get out . " Watch relieved ! " Ensign Siegel would say , saluting Garrett . Yeoman Garrett would then climb into the back seat alongside Ensign Thomas . Ensign Siegel would climb into the driver 's seat and the jeep would continue as before along the deserted road . Sometimes the jeep would stop and Yeoman Garrett and Ensign Thomas would disappear onto a beach . Ensign Siegel , a man who was never lonely with his own thoughts , would sit contentedly for the hour or so before they came back . Returning to the hospital , Garrett would be in the driver 's seat and Ensigns Siegel and Thomas in the back . Arriving there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lovely evening . " Siegel , with a small bow , would bid Ensign Thomas good night . " Oh , Max , " Alice said one night , squeezing the big ensign 's hand for a moment and looking up at him high above her . " If there was a Legion of Merit for helping the cause of love you 'd get the first one , with crossed Cupids . Sometimes I feel almost like you 're the officer-in-charge of this love affair . " " I know , my little chicken , " Ensign Siegel said drily . " I 'm alwaysglad to do my bit for Lov  --  apital letter , pleas  --  r for Humanity . " Ensign Siegel noticed that Yeoman Garrett never said anything more about sea duty . Yeoman Garrett could not date Ensign Thomas . He could not take her to dances . He could not even be seen with her . Nevertheless , their affair , thanks to Ensign Siegel 's management of it , moved alon  --  lways under the protection of nigh  --  n a fiery course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who after a twoyearhunger fast is suddenly led alone to a sumptuous table , brimmingwith delectable dishes and invited to help himself . For her part Ensign Thomas , who had started out with pity , for the first time in her life found herself really awakened . She had thought , since her arrival in the Pacific and the slavish attendance upon her by scores of naval officers of ranks ranging from ensign to captain , that she was in a female heaven . And when she got Lieutenant ( jg ) Ross Pendleton , whose Hooper rating among the nurses of the Fleet Hospital perhaps led all Tulura , she felt she had won her harp and wings . With Pendleton , who had breached the boudoirs of the stars , as he himself had informed her , she assumed that it must be good . Now she knew that Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton was a boy scout of love compared with Yeoman Second Class Garrett . Pendleton , that clinical Pendleton ! Yes , clinical as a hospital physical ! But Garrett . . . Adam ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tingled and seemed on fire , until she could have swooned in her ecstas  --  nd repeatedly did , on many a Tulura beach . She was in love , deeply , completely in love . The reason Yeoman Garrett was a better lover than Lieutenant ( jg ) PendIeton was , of course , that he appreciated it infinitely more . The slightest thing about Ensign Thomas excited him wildly . It was this that really sent the ensign to a degree she felt she had never really known what a man was before . But then Garrett underwent a critical metamorphosis in his emotions about Ensign Thomas . As the weeks passed , as his deprivationceased so richly , the wildness began to dissipate itself . There came a time when Garrett knew that Ensign Siegel had been righ  --  t was the two years in the Pacific . He had never really been in love with Ensign Thomas . He had been in love with Woman . However , this discovery changed matters scarcely at all . With emotion out of the way , Yeoman Garrett sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former relaxed attitude but compounded it geometrically . Almost every night he sallied forth from Public Relations Headquarters for a beatific evening with Ensign Thomas . They lay for luxurious hours on beaches from one end of Tulura to the other . Ensign Thomas ' storehouse of ex- citements seemed unending . Like no other enlisted man in the Pacific , he knew , Yeoman Garrett had it made . Not being in love , Garrett was free to notice , as no man in love can , some of Ensign Thomas ' faults . He was appalled at first , and then amused , over the fact that she had read practically nothing in her life . It seemed incredible to Yeoman Garrett that an Ameri- can youth could reach age twenty-two without knowing such ele- mentary facts as who Balzac was , without ever having heard of the Battle of Hastings , with thinking that Newton was a form of cookie . " Alice , " he once told her as they lay idly and deliciously strok- ing each other on a beach , " I swear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is that bad ? " Ensign Thomas said open-mindedly . " I mean ? is n't the most important thing for a woman to be a woman ? " Abruptly Garrett smiled in the darkness . " Honey , " he said , " you keep right on being a woman . " Yeoman Garrett began to like Ensign Thomas . The danger of what they were doing , their breaking of an in- flexible Navy rule , if anything gave a certain fillip to their affair , at least to Ensign Thomas . " I like fooling them , " she told Garrett one night as they lay on another beach looking up at the star-lavished Pacific sky . " Fooling all the admirals , all the officer brass , all the Navy code which says we ca n't be together . Is n't it lovely to fool them , Adam ? " " I had n't thought about it , " Yeoman Garrett said . But then he did start to think about it . " Alice , " he said one night as her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Has something ever occurred to you ? We have n't ever seen each other in daylight ! " " Why , so we have n't , " Ensign Thomas said , surprised . She giggled . " But are n't the nights nice ? " " Now , honey , be serious a moment , " Yeoman Garrett said firmly . " Yes , darling , " Ensign Thomas said meekly . " Is n't this ridiculous when you stop and think about it ? " Garrettwent on . " Siegel goes into the hospital and picks you up . You come out and I salute you . Salute you ! Then you two get in the back seat and I drive you out somewhere . Then I stop the jeep and Siegel and I change places . Then he drives us somewhere like here . Then he waits out there by the road for an hour or two , like he is right now . Then you two get in the back seat and I drive you back to the hospital . Then he takes you inside . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , honey , " Ensign Thomas said reasonably , " how else can we do it ? " " You mean I 'm not good enough to walk right in the hospital in this goddamn little-boy pajama suit and say , Where 's my date the ensign ! ' " Garrett roared the phrase . " Now , honey , " Ensign Thomas said soothingly . " You know I do n't mean that . You know that the first time you did it they would n't let us see each other again . " The very thought of this prospect put the fear of God into YeomanGarrett for a moment . " I guess you 're right , " he said , suddenly subdued . But then , a couple of nights later , he was back at it . His fingers were moving gently over her face when they stopped suddenly . " What 's wrong , darling ? " Ensign Thomas , who was probably a much wiser woman than her lover thought , could tell at once something was . " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just that I 'd like to see you . " Then he exploded angrily . " God damn it , I feel like a . . . like152a goddamn weasel or something that can come out only at night ! " " I know , " Ensign Thomas said quietly . " But , honey , why fight something we do n't have to fight , " she said in an effort at reason . " We 're happy . We 're having what we wan  --  his . Why fight it when we 've won already ? Why not let well enough alone ? " It was a woman 's advice and really excellent advice . But YeomanGarrett was not the sort who could let well enough alone . On her next day off , he finally decided , he would drive over to the hospital just by himself and pick Ensign Thomas up . He would wear bathing trunks and a T-shirt , which would not reveal his lack of rank and which officers often wore anyhow when pickingnurses up for daytime swimming dates . This struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer . And they would be at least partly in the open . Ensign Thomas tried to oppose this plan . She never had a chance . " I 'll pick you up Thursday at noon , " Yeoman Garrett firmly told her . " All right , then , Adam , " she said slowly . Thursday when Garrett stopped by for Ensign Thomas she was very nervous . Nervous when he came in for her , nervous as they started away from the hospital , Ensign Thomas walking faster than usual . This made Garrett a little angry and he deliberately slowed his own pace . " What 's wrong , are you ashamed of me ? " " Do you like saying silly things ? " she said in a low voice . But as they got into the jeep and started away , Yeoman Garrett said , " I 'm sorry , Alice . " Then he looked over at her . And she looked at him . They had never really seen each other completely before . And each could only gain by daylight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeoman Garrett said in awe . " Oh , Adam , " Ensign Thomas said , feeling an equal awe . Garrett swerved the jeep sharply , where he had wandered over to the left side of the road , to avert a three-quarter-ton truck bearingdown on them. 53 Ultimate fraternizationGarrett , who was a superb swimmer , decided to try a new beach he had heard of situated on the remote side of the island , where the swimming was supposed to be particularly good . The beach , walled on three sides by the black boondocks , was of white sand so fine as to seem pulverized , and soft as a woman 's hair . It sloped gently down to water of a blueness almost unreal and clear as a shined window . It was quiet water , shielded by the coral reef which rose whitely a couple hundred yards out . They could hardly wait to get into it . For a while they idled happily in the water , the warm contentmentof the day lightly covering the excitement that swelled in anticipation in them . Ensign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted her into his arms as easily as lifting a puppy , then effortlessly tossed her , amid screams and giggles , into the water . Then she lay on her back , in the water , body and face to the sky , while he held her up with one hand flat under her waist and with the other traced her body , which he had never really seen before . After a couple of hours Garrett left Ensign Thomas , whose swimming ability was limited to perhaps thirty furious feet , dog paddling around inside , and struck out beyond the coral reef for a shot of real swimming . With long strokes he paced off about a half mile one way in the deep water , a half mile back . These long swims always made him feel exuberant , and today , probably from knowing what was waiting for him on shore , he felt he owned the sea . Coming back inside the reef , he waded out of the water and saw her lying in the sun , asleep . Silently he knelt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one elbow , looked down upon her for a long time . Then he took her into his arms . " Adam ! " His wet body against her own sun-heated body awakenedher . " Oh , Adam ! " she said . " Not here . It 's broad daylight . " " Nobody 's in ten miles , " he said , drawing her to him . " Yep , it 's daylight ! " he said suddenly , and joyously . " Pure , broad sunny day-154 light up there ! Do you realize we 've never ... we 've never in the daylight ! Never in the sun ! " Afterward they lay in each other 's arms , looking up at the sunny sky . " I feel so free ! " Yeoman Garrett said . " Alice , I love you , " he said before he knew it . But then , surprised , he realized that it was true . " Yes , darling , " Ensign Thomas said drowsily , since she had never known that he did n't . Yeoman Garrett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . . . Ensign Thomas came to with a start . She was still in Garrett 's arm  --  nd the sun had begun to pale in the sky . " Adam , " she said , waking him . " It 's late . We have to hurry , honey . When I 'm off in the day , I have the night watch , you know . " Garrett picked her up and carried her through the stretch of un- derbrush to the jeep , where he set her down in the front seat . " How I love you , " Yeoman Garrett said with an air of discov- ery , his lips moving across hers . " Me , too , " Ensign Thomas said , her fingers touching his cheeks . Yeoman Garrett felt very strange , quietly and nicely strange . All the way back to the hospital he kept thinking : How odd , to fall in love now . With her . With a very specific woman named Alice Thomas . By the time they reached the hospital it was almost dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas said as they drove into the grounds . " And not come in . Let 's do n't live too danger- ously , darling . " Garrett started to get out but Alice squeezed his hand . " Please , darling , " she said . " It was . . . it was . Let the ensign know best this time . " Yeoman Garrett smiled . " Okay , Ensign , " he said , drawing his finger under her chin . She hopped out and he waited , watching her go up the walk . l Ic sat a few moments longer , watching the door where she had disappeared . My God , how I am in love with her , he thought . This day ! He had just turned to start the jeep when he saw Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton sitting in a jeep about twenty feet in front of his and looking straight at him . Pendleton had a nurse with him . They somehow looked as if they had been sitting there awhile . Then Pendleton started his jeep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeep , no more than a yard away , he slowed almost to a halt . " ' Well , how was it , Garrett ? " he said . " Pretty good , eh ? " Then Pendleton gunned his jeep so suddenly that the spinning tires almost spat gravel into Garrett 's face . Yeoman Garrett sat there a moment . Then he started his jeep and drove slowly out of the hospital grounds . It took him a long time to cover the eighteenmiles to Public Relations Headquarters . Most of the way , all he could keep thinking , bitterly , was the thing he had said out there under the sun when he had really just discovered her , " I feel so free . " " Sailors , " Lieutenant Commander Nash said at the morning conference of Public Relations officers , " one of the most serious things in all my naval command history has happened , and certainlyone of the most unusual problems of all I 've ever had to deal with . " " What is it , Commander ? " Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exec said . " By that I mean plain , raw , unadulteratedsex . " The officers ' ears went immediately into general quarters . " An enlisted man , " Commander Nash exploded , " is dating an officer ! " " My God , sir ! " Griffin said , appalled . " I did n't know we had any of that kind in our midst ! " 156 " No , no , it 's perfectly normal ! " the exec put in hurriedly . " By that I mean stupendously abnormal . " " How 's that , Commander ? " Griffin said , perplexed . " An enlisted man is dating a nurse-officer ! " the exec burst forth . The rows of officers sat up with great interest in their chairs . " Great Lord ! " exclaimed Lieutenant Commander Gladney . " Who is it ? " " Yeoman Second Class Garrett , " the exec angrily let out the name , " has been secretly dating one of the Fleet Hospital per- sonnel ! " " Garrett ! " two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world could that happen ? " Lieutenant Com- mander Wayne Ilereford asked . " Flow should I know ! " Commander Nash said violently . " I 'm not Dorothy Dix . All I 'm interested in is that one of our men has been violating one of the oldest of all naval laws . An enlisted man dating an officer ! It 's unheard of ! " " Who 's the nurse ? " asked Lieutenant Griffin . " Anybody we know ? " " I would n't know whether you do or not , Griffin , " the exec said wearily . " Her name is Ensign Alice Thomas . " " Ensign Alice Thomas . . . " Griffin said slowly . " Why " ? he turned slightly in his chair to look at Lieutenant ( jg ) Ross Pendle- ton in the row behind him ? " is n't that the babe you used to go with , Ross ? " " I know her , " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton said . " A real slut . I had a date or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interesting . " This was a new explanation to the other officers as to why En- sign Thomas and Pendleton had ceased dating , and they looked at the radio liaison officer with interest . " Well ! " Lieutenant Griffin said . " I always thought Ensign Thomas was pretty well stacked up . " " I guess that 's how Garrett got to know her , " the exec said . " He carried the .45 for Ross here when Ross had a couple of dates , as he says , with this Thomas woman . " " A couple dates ? " Lieutenant Griffin turned in his chair . " I seem to remember you were giving Ensign Thomas a hell of a rush , Ross . Well ! " " I was n't aware you followed my personal affairs so closely , Griffin , " Pendleton said acidly . " Well ! " Lieutenant Griffin said happily . " Ensign Thomas and Yeoman Garrett . So she stopped dating you , Ross ... " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton , a man eternally suave , unruffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued with a happy smile . " So one of the yeomen 's been dating Pendleton 's girl . " Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton gripped the arms of his chair until his knuckles were a bone-white . " You listen to me now , Griffin . . . " he said . " Well , " Lieutenant Griffin said . " So the great lover had a woman taken away from hi  --  nd by an enlisted man ! " Suddenly Pendleton leaped from his chair and stood glaring down at Griffin . " I 'm warning you . . . I 'm warning you , Griffin . . . " he stutteredin a blind fury . " I 'm warning you ... " The startled officers jerked around in their seats . They had never seen Lieutenant ( jg ) Pendleton 's suaveness even slightly marred before . Tumbling to his feet , Lieutenant Commander Gladney lumbered his plumpness between the two officers . " Knock this off ! " Lieutenant Commander Nash was shouting . " Knock this off ! We 've got enough of a problem here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on here ! Knock it off or I 'll have you both locked up ! " the exec yelledthefirst time he had ever spoken sharply to Pendleton . Pendleton , his feathers still bristling , nevertheless was persuaded by Gladney to return to his seat. 158 ' 59 Ultimate fraternization " Jumping Jupiter ! " the exec said . " Naval officers ! " The exec allowed the room to quiet down slightly before proceeding . " Now let 's get back to it , " he said briskly . Suddenly he looked across the first rows to Ensign Siegel in the back . " Siegel , " he said , " it 's your yeoman , after all . And , by the way , have n't you been dating this Thomas woman yourself ? I do n't keep up with these things but I thought I saw you together a coupletimes . " " I 've gone out some with this Thomas woman , " Ensign Siegel said . IIe shook his head sadly . " To think that my own yeoman would do this behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if Pendleton here was n't enough for her , I guess she 'd be bound to consider me equally lacking . " " Lacking ! " Pendleton spat out . " Boy , I can guarantee you that if any woman finds me lacking there has to be something wrong with her . Say ! " Pendleton said with an air of discovery . " I bet he started getting his licks in when all those Japs overpowered me that night . He probably made himself out a big hero . " " Well , you 've got to admit , Ross , " Siegel said , changing the subject quickly , " that Garrett 's a very good-looking boy . " " Good-looking ! " Pendleton exclaimed peevishly . " I do n't think he 's good-looking at all . " " For heaven 's sake ! " the exec shouted . " What in the name of Jupiter do the looks of Yeoman Garrett have to do with the issue ! Which is , " the exec shouted it in a furious scream , " An enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams settled the room , which had been extremely restless and excited , first by the news , then by the PendletonGriffintiff , down slightly . " Now , " the exec said crisply . " Siegel . It 's your yeoman , after all . " The exec looked closely at Ensign Siegel . " Have you noticed Garrett acting strange lately ? " " No more so than any of us , " Ensign Siegel said . He waited amoment , then added , " Though when I stop to think about it , he has seemed a little more relaxed . " There was a small chuckle around the room . " Ensign Thomas would relax the hell out of me , " Lieutenant Griffin said . " Mind your rudder , Griffin , " the exec said . " You do n't think it 's a psycho ward case , Siegel ? " " No , sir , " Siegel said . " I know Garrett pretty well , and whateverhe did , he certainly is n't nuts . " " Then he 's got something coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such an outrageous flouting of the Navy ! Probably laughing up his sleeve all the time at this mockery he was makingof officers ! " " He probably just wanted a woman , sir , " Ensign Siegel said . " A woman ! " the exec exclaimed . " He 's taken a naval officer ! " " I think it 's outrageous , " Pendleton said , pretty tautly . " What gets me , " the exec said in baffled tones , " is how shecould do it . It 's completely beyond me , how an officer couldlower herself like that . " " Well , maybe she just liked him , " Siegel said . " Liked him ! " the exec exclaimed . " Liking enlisted men is one thing . But it 's another to carry it to the point of ultimate fraternizationlike she 's done . " The exec opened his right top drawer and brought out his 73 ( 50 binoculars . Striding to the screened window , he looked through them for a few moments down the hillside . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawer and sat back in his chair . " The punishment , " he said almost to himself . " What shall the punishment be ? " He waited in reflection . " Jupiter , you could really throw the book at this man ! " " Commander , " Ensign Siegel spoke up . " May I say some-thing ? " The exec looked impatient at this interruption of his reverie . " Permission granted , " he said wearily.
