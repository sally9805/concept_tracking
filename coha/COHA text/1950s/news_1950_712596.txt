txt A question that many persons will be inclined to ask who have the patience and fortitude to carry them through he 7,000-word economic report by the President is , Why is this document necessary ? . What economic statistics it contains have already been made public by the Secretary of Commerce or will make their appearance in the annual budget message next week . As for its economic philosophy and its statement of legislative objectives , these merely go over ground previously covered in the annual rel.ort of the Council of Economic Advisers and the President 's message on the state of the Union . This synthesis of preceding reports and reports to come is neither better nor worse than the parts of which it is the sum . If anything , it may be said that the placing in such close juxtaposition of the excellent factual material of the Commerce Department , on the one hand , and the President 's dissertation on economic policy , on the other , tends to emphasize the " weplanned-it-that-way " attitude of the Council of Economic Advisers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse praiseworthy aspirations with a practical and coherent economic program . " The relatively safe passage from inflation to greater stability , " observes Mr. Truman , " was no accident . " It was , he says , the result of a greater degree of , enlightenment and restraint on the part of business men , workers and farmers , " aided by public policies which had been developed over the years and had been improved by experience . " The fact of the matter is that the President 's advisers were still talking inflation control long after the boom of 1946-48 had passed , and that he was demanding an additional $4 billions in taxation , originally urged as an anti-inflationary measure . It was the Federal Reserve Board that sensed the change of direction in the economy and took the first steps to meet the changed situation while experts in the White House were still trying to figure out what had happened . Greater restraint in their wage demands by the nation 's labor unions may have played a part in the stabilization of the economy in 1949 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Executive , one of whose economic advisers , if memory serves , was openly urging the unions a few months ago not to relinquish their wage demands . The public policies to which Mr. Truman is apparently alluding do not represent anything new in Government . They were simply a reversion to , or a continuance of , the pump-priming of the Thirties , with this main difference : The general policies of deficit financing and wholesale encouragement of public and private borrowing ( as in residential building ) were introduced originally when the national income was badly shrunken , industrial activity was at low ebb and unemployment had reached historic proportions . In 1949 they were superimposed upon the economy at a time when the latter was close to its record peacetime level . It is not possible to say to what degree , if at all , these policies contributed to the 1949 readjustment . Considered in terms of the long-run situation , however , they must be viewed with misgivings . If we are going to resort to inflationary stimulants every time production slackens slightly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are we going to turn to when the need arises for combating a recession of serious proportions ? And what becomes of Mr. Truman 's observation that " federal receipts should be sufficient over a. period of years to balance the budget and provide a surplus for debt reduction " ? What is " a period of years " ? We are now entering the fifth year after the end of fighting the war . The interval has been marked by the highest level of material prosperity the nation ever enjoyed , yet taxes are close to their wartime highs , and the real federal debt , after a temporary post-war dip , is headed for a new peak , which it is expected to reach within the next twelve months . Yet , it is typical of the contradictory nature of Mr. Truman 's economic report that it concludes with twelve " legislative recommendations , " nine of which call for new and heavy spending or for the incurring of riew financial liabilities by the Government , as a matter of permanent federal policy .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
