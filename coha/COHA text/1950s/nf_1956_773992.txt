The back loops are caught into the hooks of the second small roller . See ( a ) and ( b ) of Illustration 1 which shows an end-on view of the rollers and their cords . When you have completed this step , you will have one roller at the top of the loom and hanging from it two smaller ones which should now be adjusted until they are hori-zontal . The hooks in the ends of each small roller are made so that they swivel , and therefore these rollers move freely . The time has come to hang the harnesses . Take two more cords and wind them one and a half turns around one of the small rollers placing one cord at or near each end of it . Then while your helper holds the two small rollers , loop the front ends of these cords ( c ) into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness and do the same with the rear loops of these cords as at ( d ) . The harnesses ( g ) , be ing all alike , it makes no difference which you use first . The other two harnesses are connected to the other small roller in the same manner as indicated at ( e ) and ( f ) . Push down on all four har nesses at the same time , and presently they will all be hanging evenly . 15 . As you can see , the harnesses are hanging free at the bottom , and now they are to be attached to the lamms underneath them one by one . The harness in front ( the one next to the // beater ) is called harness number one , and it is attached to the lamm underneath , which is nearest the front of the loom . The next harness , number two , is attached to the next lamm and so on for all four harnesses and lamms . Better type looms have V-shaped steel wire pieces at the bottom of each harness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamm . The V-shape of this wire keeps the harnesses horizontal when they are in use . When all four harnesses are fastened to the lamms , the latter should be horizontal with respect to the floor , and harnesses and rollers should be level as seen in the illustration of the four-harness loom . ATTACHING ROLLERS AND HARNESSES If the manufacturer of your loom has not supplied you with ready-made cords for the attachment of the rollers and harnesses , you will of course be obliged to cut them yourself from the hank of cord provided . An old loom which you have resurrected from somewhere will also have to have its new cords cut to size . It is a tricky thing to get the harnesses just the right height from the top of the loom so that the weaving will be satisfactory . In general , however , on a loom of this type they should hang so that when a lightweight cord is tied from the slabstock and threaded through the eye of one of the heddles and then through one of the slots called dents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be horizontal . In order to accomplish this , it will be necessary to cut the cords for the suspension of the rollers and harnesses long enough so that they can be adjusted up or down . This final adjustment of the cords is made after the loom is all threaded and ready for weaving . On page 76 , there is shown the snitch or loom knot which is the one used when cords are to be made adjustable . In order to hang the two smaller rollers from the larger one , double two long pieces of your cord , making them long enough to go around the upper roller one and a half times with both the looped and the cut ends // hanging down . As the rollers are tied the same at each end , Illustration 2 shows an end-on view of them . Take one of the long doubled pieces and , after winding it one and a half times around the big roller , fasten the looped end into the hook of the small roller as at ( a ) . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller for you . Just how long to make the hang ing ends of the cord is difficult to say for it depends upon the height of the top roller , but eight to ten inches will usually suffice . Next take a shorter length of cord and knot it into a loop about six inches long ( b ) . Attach this loop to the hook of the other small roller as at ( c ) . Have the knot come near the hook . Then by bending the loop at ( d ) back upon itself the cut ends hanging down from the upper roller are tied at ( e ) in a snitch knot by fol-lowing the steps in Illustration 21 . The distance from the top of the large roller to the top of the small rollers after the snitch knots at ( e ) are tied and adjusted will be somewhere between eight and ten inches unless the loom you have has extremely high side uprights . In Illustration 2 you can see that the harnesses ( f ) are attached in pairs to each small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and snitch knots . When these cords have been tied , adjust the snitch knots at ( g ) for the time being so that the eyes in the heddles are in line with the top of the breast beam and the slabstock as was described on page 11 . On my looms the distance from the top // of small rollers to the top of the harnesses is less than that from the large roller to the small rollers or about six inches . The rollers and harnesses should be horizontal and level . If there are no V-shaped wire pieces or any hooks on the bottom of the harnesses for attaching them to the lamms , you will have to tie snitch knots here , too . Loop a doubled strand of cord around the bottom of each harness exactly in the center . The ends of a similarly doubled cord coming from the lamm directly beneath the harness are used to complete the knot . When adjusted the four lamms should be horizontal in respect to the floor and all level . Of course , all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHAT STYLE OF LOOM TO CHOOSE There is a great difference of opinion among weavers concerning the best type of loom to own . A loom is often a lifetime investment involving considerable outlay of money , therefore it pays to investigate carefully before buying . There are guilds and periodicals devoted to weaving mentioned in the Bibliography from which you can get good advice to form your own conclusions . I recommend especially that you look over , the advertisements and pertinent articles in the Handweaver &; Craftsman , a quarterly which no weaver can afford to be without . Check carefully the manufacturers ' specifications , their guarantees , what they supply with the loom in the way of aprons and shuttles , delivery charges , etc . The question of the size of loom to purchase is one of great importance to a new weaver . To weave wide materials , such as draperies and coverlets , you will require a loom which has a weaving capacity of 45 inches at least . The weaving capacity of a loom is determined by the width of the harnesses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other yardages one of the 36-inch looms will be wide enough . There are also floor looms which are narrower , weaving from about sixteen to twenty-seven inches . But in general a 36-inch loom will serve you well and the difference in price between the narrower // ones and this size is surprisingly small . Remember , once you buy a narrow loom , you are limited for you can not weave any wider than the width of your harnesses except by a technique of double width weaving which is usually considered more tedious than it is worth . On the other hand , it often happens that the wide loom is seldom used to its full capacity , and all it does is take up space . Another item to be considered is the placement of the treadles on the framework of the loom . Notice that those on the loom illustrated are bolted to the front or heel bar of the loom . On a fourharness loom of this style this makes the treadling very easy because the weaver can slide the foot along the treadle towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treadles are fastened at the rear of the loom so that the front ends are free , they often wobble from side to side , making them more difficult to find with the feet . For this reason , my own preference is for treadles which are fastened at the front of the loom . Beaters on a loom may be of two styles also . Some are like the one mentioned , fastened at the side of the loom near the floor . Others are known as overhead or hanging beaters and are fastened from a rocking shaft at the top of the loom . I do not enjoy weaving on a loom of this sort , myself , but am told that for the weaving of tweeds and woolens it is especially desirable . The looms manufactured in Norway , Sweden , and Denmark are usually of this kind . But the most important decision you will have to make with regard to your loom , aside from the cost , make , and size of it , will be the matter of whether you are going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been describing thus far or a rising shed loom . To try to explain the difference between them before you ( presumably ) know anything about weaving is like trying to put the cart before the horse . However , the sinking shed loom has its harnesses suspended from the top of the loom in such a way that when they are fastened to the lamms beneath them and the lamms to the treadles beneath them , the harnesses operate in pairs . As we have already found out this was brought about by the use of three rollers // and cords . Some looms like this have other means of hanging the harnesses , but they are not as satisfactory . ( See page 111 . ) The sinking shed loom is also called the counterbalanced loom , because when it is in operation , the weaver steps on certain of the treadles and in so doing pulls down two of the harnesses while at the same time the other two rise . In other words , the harnesses are counterbalanced two against two . Many , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this type and so were the huge old looms made of hand-hewn logs upon which the old Colonial coverlets were woven on four harnesses . The rising shed loom , on the other hand , operates on quite a different principle . There are no rollers with their cords or any of the other methods of suspension of harnesses referred to in connection with the sinking shed loom . The usual type of rising shed loom is equipped with levers called jacks and so is often referred to as a jack type loom . Jacks are levers which may be found above or below the harnesses and which pivot at or near the middle . When one end of the levers is pulled down by means of a cord going from the lever to a lamm , the other end lifts or pushes up the harness but , unlike the action of the sinking shed loom , the other harnesses do not move . Not all rising shed looms operate by means of jacks , for there are also roller lamms which , when used in connection with cords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sash . Because the harnesses of a rising shed loom are not counterbalanced , they do not need to operate in pairs but can be used one at a time , two at a time and three at a time with no difficulty . The advantage of the rising shed lies in this fact , for there are many instances when it is not only desirable but necessary for harnesses to do this . The loom with counterbalanced harnesses and sinking shed does not , as a general rule , take kindly to such treatment . ( See however page 143 . ) If I were starting out all over again to buy my equipment for weaving , I would think seriously about the rising shed floor loom for the reason given above . Of course , there are many arguments in favor of the sinking shed loom . They are less noisy to operate // and less expensive to buy . The noise of harnesses returning to their resting position can be quite an item if you do not have a loom room away from the rest of the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given for the counterbalanced loom so that it becomes necessary to transpose them for the rising shed . This is not a valid objection , however , for once you start weaving and observe what happens as a loom operates , the change of treadling from one type loom to the other becomes easy . Directions are given for transposing in Chapters 9 and 10 . It is true that there is more strain put upon the warp threads when a loom has the rising shed , and this is largely the reason why weavers are not in agreement on the subject of which type is better . The question of what kind of warp beam to have on your loom can be settled easily , for you can have both what is known as a sectional beam and a plain beam inasmuch as they are generally interchangeable . Also the expense of the extra beam is not great . Further discussion of plain beams and sectional beams and what the difference is , is left for Chapters 4 and 10 . The loom pictured has a plain beam . Warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as standard equipment on floor looms . A discussion of readyspooled warp will be found on page 21 , and the novice will find out in the next chapter what the word warp is all about . Thus far we have mentioned only floor looms , but there are also on the market table looms either with or without stands . Of the rising shed type , the harnesses of table looms are operated not by the feet ( unless treadles are purchased separately ) , but by the use of hand levers . Four-harness table looms are narrower than most floor looms so they take up much less space , and many of them are easily carried from one place to another . They are handy to have as accessory looms and for teaching purposes though their price , unfortunately , is not proportionate to their size . The exhilaration which comes when both the hand and the feet are used in rhythmic weaving , however , can only be experienced from the use of a floor loom . // Both table looms and floor looms may be had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient to take to guild meetings and weaving conferences . Folding floor looms are somewhat more expensive than the rigid type and some are likely to be less firm . However , there are excellent folding looms available . The equipment a weaver requires does not end with the ac quisition of a loom and shuttles . It is wise , for instance , to buy the bench recommended by the manufacturer so that it will be suitable to the height of the breast beam from the floor . Other pieces of equipment are necessary as aids in the preparation of a loom for weaving and for the weaving itself . It is the purpose of the first part of A Handweaver 's Workbook to acquaint you with these and to instruct in their use . Chapter 2 GETTING READY As your loom comes from the manufacturer , not very often is it ready for you to use . It is up to you , therefore , to go through certain preliminaries known as the setting-up process . SELECTING THE WARP Part of this preparation consists of the selection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thread will then be made into a set of parallel strands called warp ends which are to be stretched lengthwise on your loom before any weaving can begin . Inasmuch as cloth is woven not only of these lengthwise threads but also of crosswise threads , you will need in addition what is known as weft . Woof as a synonym for weft is now becoming obsolete although it is a term still used by many of the older weavers . The commercial term filling is also sometimes used by handweavers to mean the crosswise threads or weft . The thread chosen for warp must be strong and suitable for the fabric desired . For rag rugs , for instance , a thread called carpet warp is often used and this can be bought at most five-and-ten-cent stores . For luncheon sets , runners , table cloths , some bag and dress 18 // materials , a cotton warp known as 20/2 ( " twenties-two , " or in Canada " two-twenties " ) might be your choice . For linen towels , table linens , and linen dress materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen . There are many sources of weaving supplies . You will find their advertisements in the periodicals mentioned in the bibliography , and you should send for their catalogs and sample cards . Suppose we decide to use some of this finer 20/2 warp in the natural color . This is a warp which does not offer too many problems for the novice , yet is a little more intricate than plain carpet warp would be . With this 20/2 cotton warp we shall go through all the operations necessary to put the warp on the loom , to thread it to a pattern and then to weave it . ALLOWING FOR DRAW-IN A good width to plan to weave at first is 14 inches , which means 14 inches for the material when woven . In order that the fabric will be 14 inches wide when off the loom , it is necessary to plan so that the width of the warp on the loom will be greater . The necessity for this is something referred to by weavers as draw-in . No matter how excellent a weaver a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the warp on the loom even before it is laundered . This draw-in or shrinkage in width varies not only according to the type of warp yarn used but also with the weft . Moreover , some weavers just naturally seem to draw in more than others when they weave . There are other things , too , about which we will speak later in Chapter 10 that cause drawing in . Much of the time a weaver must lean upon past experience for a guide . Therefore , for this narrow warp it is sufficient to say now that we will prepare the warp to be 15 inches wide on the loom , or one inch wider than we wish the material to be . This will take care of the draw-in of even a beginner . A 20/2 cotton warp woven into fabric is usually found to have thirty warp ends in each inch of its width . Carpet warp is much // heavier than 20/2 and so is planned for fewer warp ends per inch . For instance , if rag rugs are to be woven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each inch across the rug . Of course , the more warp ends there are per inch the finer the material is . Some warps are made very much finer than this , but the usual number is thirty for 20/2 . FIGURING THE NUMBER OF WARP ENDS Now we can begin to plan the warp we are going to put on the loom . It is to be fifteen inches wide , and in each inch there will be thirty warp ends . Multiplying fifteen by thirty we have as a result 450 warp ends across the warp . If you examine any piece of yard goods you will see at the right and left side of it a narrow strip where the threads are closer together . This is called a selvage . In order to allow for the narrowing in at the selvages , we add at least four warp ends at each side of every piece of weaving . If we did not allow these extra warp ends at the sides , the beginning and end of the pattern which we are going to thread later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not weave in a pattern but just make plain material , we still add for the selvages in order to improve the appearance and wearing qualities of the weaving . What to do with the selvages and how to thread a pattern is discussed in another chapter . The warp we are going to put on the loom , therefore , will have 458 warp ends in it , or thirty for each inch of width plus eight for the selvages . The exact number of thirty per inch will be maintained during the weaving by the use of the reed ( E ) . In this instance , we will use a reed that has sixteen steel partitions per inch . The spaces between are called dents , so this is known as a 15-dent reed . In each dent we will put two warp ends . A carpet warp prepared so as to have twelve warp ends for each inch of the material 's width would require the use of a 12-dent reed and one warp end would be put through each dent . Or , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through each of the dents . It is the // reed , therefore , that keeps the weaving at the width desired , and its den tage and number of warp ends per dent determine the fineness or coarseness of the material . All this is anticipating a bit , for the feed is not used right now . Reeds of all different sizes and lengths may be purchased from supply houses . Be sure to specify how long a reed you want and how many dents per inch are needed . Most looms are furnished with 15 dent reeds , but you will need others as the scope of your weaving widens . SPOOLED WARP Many table looms and a few floor looms are equipped with hexagonal steel beams about % inch in diameter . These are for use with what are called ready warped spools . If you have one of these looms , buy one spool of warp for each two-inch width of the material you plan to weave . Spooled warp may be purchased from most supply houses . Because your warp is already wound for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need to go through the processes to be described in the next three chapters . You will , however , have to know how to thread a pattern , so read Chapter 6 carefully . Chapter 3 PREPARING THE WARP FOR A LOOM WITH A PLADN BEAM The following directions are for the preparation of a warp for a loom that has what is called a " plain beam . " If your loom has a warp beam which is studded with wooden or metal pegs that divide its length into small sections , skip this part and refer to the next chapter , where you will find - instructions for the sectional beam . There are two pieces of equipment , either of which may be used for the preparation of a warp on this type of beam . First , let us consider the one called the warping frame . The alternate method is the use of a warping reel , and a description of it and its use will be found later in this chapter . THE WARPING FRAME AND ITS USE Warping frames may be purchased or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made by a carpenter and is permanently fixed to the wall . It is larger than the usual ones , being made of one-inch pine with one-inch dowels , ten inches long , which are 22 // spaced far enough apart in the frame so that the knuckles do not get bumped when the warp is being prepared on it . ( See Illustration 3 . ) Usually these frames have the distance between peg A and peg 1 ) equal a yard instead of two yards as here . The distance between peg A and B is 18 inches and between peg B and peg C seven inches , but any other suitable dimensions could have been used . A drill press was used to bore the holes in order that the dowels which fit tightly in them might be absolutely perpendicular . If they are not , the dowels , not being at right angles to the frame , will cause the last threads wound on them to be shorter ( or maybe longer ) than the first ones and this will make the warp a trouble-some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worry some of the early weavers very much , for down in the Southern Appalachian High-lands I have seen warping frames leaning against the outside walls // of the mountain cabins ready for use . The pegs were made of corn cobs ! The following is a step-by-step description of the method of pre-paring a warp prior to putting it on the warp beam . When finished , you will have 458 warp ends lying side by side , each ten yards long . 1 . Place two spools or tubes of the 20/2 cotton warp ( of course any other warp is handled in this same way ) on a spool rack . See sketch of this piece of equipment ( page 43 ) . Or you can put each one in a deep bowl or wastepaper basket on the floor near the frame . If your warp yarn was bought in cones , place each cone on the floor . The weight of the cones when full will prevent them toppling over , but as they are used up , they roll around on the floor and cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 is useful for cones , and it does not have to be anything fancy . A warp this width and length will contain approximately 4580 yards of warp yarn . You would be wise , however , to buy a pound of it because you will need some for weaving with later on and what is left can always be used for other things . There are 8400 yards in a pound of 20/2 warp . Purchase it in two half pounds so as to save yourself the bother of winding part of it on to a spool in order to have two warp ends . Or , if the manufacturer does not sell it in half pounds , you can buy it in two-ounce tubes . If the warp is in skeins , it must be wound into balls or on to large spools . To hold the skeins while this is being done , you // will find a skein holder , known also as a swift , very convenient . When winding yarn into balls , begin by wrapping it around a small stone or other weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are using them . Two spools , balls , cones , etc. , are needed because , to save time , two warp ends are going to be wound on at the same time . While it is true that some weavers wind on four warp ends at a time , it has always been my sad experience that more time is spent later on untangling the warp ends during the weaving than it is worth . Therefore , I never wind any more than two at once of any fiber when preparing a warp this way . On the other hand , it is usually considered a waste of time to wind on only one end at a time . 2 . Take the two ends coming from your spools , etc. , tie them together , then tie them around peg A of the warping frame . Follow Illustration 3 as you read what follows : 3 . Let the two ends run easily through your fingers as you draw them from the spools and separate them by keeping the first finger of your guiding hand between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends over peg B and under peg C. Then over and under each of pegs D , E , F , G , and H , which in this instance is the end peg because you are winding ten yards for this , your first , warp . Do not use much tension as you wind , but keep it uniform throughout . Too much tension will cause the pegs to lean inward and may even snap them off . This once happened when one of my students was winding with a little too much enthusiasm . When you have reached peg H , you have wound on this frame two warp ends , each ten yards long . 5 . Now start to wind back up to peg A. Do this by bringing the warp ends from peg H across to peg G. Under G and over on top of it and so across to F. Under F , up and over to E and continue in this manner under pegs E and D. 6 . But now go over peg C and under peg B ( just the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from B straight across and under peg A ready to start again . // 7 . Repeat steps 4 , 5 , and 6 over and over again . You will notice that on the way down from A to H you carry the warp ends over the pegs D , E , F , G , and H , while on the way up from H to A you place them under these same pegs . As you wind up and down the frame , take care to place each two warp ends alongside of the last ones on each peg and do not allow them to pile up one on top of the other . When , however , the pegs begin to get filled up push the strands of warp already wound down toward the base of each peg so they will not slip off . If they should tend to fall off at the ends of the pegs in spite of this , a rubber band wound around each peg at its outer end will be of great help . 8 . As the winding progresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound . This counting is done between pegs B and C where the warp ends cross . I find it easy to count by fifties , so when I have wound twenty-five of the double strands I tie these fifty warp ends off with a piece of colored carpet warp between pegs B and C , leaving the ends of my tying thread long enough to tie off the next fifty and so on for the entire 458 desired . Do not use a hard knot here for these ties are only temporary ones . 9 . When a knot appears in the warp yarn as you are winding , it is best to eliminate it immediately rather than let it stay in and be put on the loom . Suppose there is a knot in the warp coming from one of the spools when you are halfway between peg D and E , for instance . Break off the warp end which has the knot in it back at peg A ( the nearest end peg ) . Break the same warp end at the knot discarding the thread in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end coming from the spool onto the end at peg A and go on winding as before . NOTE : The cross which you can see is being formed between pegs B and C is absolutely necessary and must be correctly made . Its object is to keep the warp ends in order , two by two , as they are wound . The necessity for this will become apparent when certain steps in the setting-up process are made later on . // Knots that occur or are made at or near the end pegs A and H , that is , the beginning and end pegs , will not come into the woven portion of the warp so they do not matter . Any others should be eliminated as described above even though this may mean cutting off several yards of warp . The same process takes care of a spool of warp which runs out before the others . Tie the new one on at either the beginning or the end peg , whichever is the nearer . Also , the same procedure is followed in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch-wide stripes of alternating blue and natural 20/2 , for instance , take two spools of the blue and two of the natural and put them on your spool rack . Wind thirty ends of the blue ( this would be fifteen double strands at the cross ) . Then break off the blue ends , and tie on to them the two ends coming from the natural colored spools . In this instance the tying will take place at peg H. Wind on another thirty ends . Cut the natural colored warp ends off , this time at peg A , and attach the two blue again . It is not necessary to tie each blue to each natural . Simply take the two of one color and tie them to the two of the other . The reason for winding thirty ends of each color to make one-inch stripes is because we planned to use thirty ends per inch , you will remember . For a heavier warp , such as carpet warp , twelve or fifteen warp ends would be sufficient for each stripe , depending upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 . When the winding is completed , you will have nine bunches of warp ends tied up with colored ties . The last bunch will have 58 warp ends in it , making 458 in all . Remember , these are 458 single warp ends or 229 double strands , meaning that you will have gone down and up the frame 229 times in all . 11 . To end , take the two warp ends coming from the spools , tie them around the nearest end peg , and cut them off . The next step must be done very carefully . Tie the warp strands securely at the four places marked on the illustration as a , b , c , and d . These ties hold in place the crosses formed between pegs B and // C. Make these ties with a colored carpet warp drawn tightly , and use a bowknot ( like tying a shoelace ) which can be pulled out easily later on without any need for scissors . 12 . Now pull out the colored tie which you used to count the warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be seen that warp wound like this , two ends at a time , results in an even number of warp ends . If at any time it is necessary or desirable for you to use a pattern that needs an odd number of warp ends , wind an even number , and the extra warp end can be used to make one of the selvages wider when threading the pattern . 13 . The warp must be removed from the frame , of course , but you will find that it helps to tie it in several more places first , as follows : Make one tight tie about four feet from the cross over towards peg D. This is marked e on the sketch and is called the brake or choker tie because it prevents snarls and tangles from going farther down the length of the warp while it is being spread either through the reed or what is called a raddle as described in Chapter 5 . Also tie the warp halfway between pegs D and E , E and F , F and G , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one , at points corresponding to every yard of the warp . Finally , tie the warp where it turns around pegs A and H. Take care here to catch the very first and last loops you tied on these pegs . All these ties should be tight and fastened with bowknots so that they can be pulled out later . 14 . The warp is now ready for you to remove it from the frame by a process called chaining the warp . If you are familiar with the art of crocheting , this will be simple for it is the same thing , using the hands instead of a hook . First , however , remove your wrist watch and all jewelry which might catch in the warp ends . Buttons , especially on cuffs , can be a terrible nuisance . Begin at peg H and take the thick strand of warp off this peg holding the entire warp taut as you do so to prevent it from slipping off the other pegs . From below put your right // hand into the loop where peg H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Illustration 5 ) with this same hand . Draw your handful of warp through the loop around your wrist , and as you do this , the loop will slip forward and off the back of your right hand . Keep hold of the warp in your right hand and then put your left hand into the loop which you are holding . Reach through this loop to grasp the warp coming from the peg at c and pull it back through the loop , thus making a chain . Let go of the warp in the right hand , but keep on holding the loop which you have in your left . Now insert the right hand into the loop being held by the left hand , grasp the strand of warp and bring it through , thus forming another chain . The chains may be tight or loose as you prefer . Continue alternating with right and left hands until the brake tie ( e , Illustration 3 ) is reached . At this point , tie a piece of colored thread around the chain of warp so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process of chaining the warp shows that this all sounds much more complicated than it actually is for it is nothing but a simple chain stitch done with the hands . Some weavers prefer to use one hand to make the chain rather than alternating hands . This is satisfactory , too . Just be sure in // either case that your hand goes through the loop marked a on the sketch and not through b for if it goes through b the chain will be locked and will not unwind from that point on . The chaining of the warp is but a temporary process and it is necessary to unchain it later . NOTE : Someday you may want to wind a wide warp 36 inches wide , for instance . You will have better results if you wind it in two parts ? . half the width and chain it off ; the other half and chain off . Later slip the two sections on to the lease sticks together and treat them as one warp . 15 . Drop the chained warp into a large paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is best to handle the warp as little as possible until it is put on the loom . If the warp is not to be used until some later date , mark the bag for identification , giving information about the number of warp ends , yardage , pattern intended for , etc . Some texts suggest making two crosses , one at each end of the warp as it is being wound . When preparing a warp by using two warp ends at a time this is not necessary , but if you use a paddle as described later in this chapter , two crosses are the usual thing . At this point you are ready to follow the next steps which carry on the process known as dressing the loom . See , therefore , Chapter 5 . THE WARPING REEL AND ITS USE In place of a warping frame , any warp for a plain beam may be prepared with the use of a warping reel . A warping reel ( seeIllustration 6 ) may be bought from loom manufacturers or supply houses . Each turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending upon the circumference of the reel . The boards marked 1 and 2 on the sketch and which hold the lower and upper pegs may be moved up or down the reel so that warps of various lengths may be wound on it . The warping reel is very easy to use once you // get into the swing of it and is also less tiring than the other method . I ! ere is the way it is done : 1 . Determine where to place the adjustable board ( 1 ) which holds the end peg H. This is done by tying to peg A a measured length of thread which differs in color from your warp yarn . Spin the reel clockwise , and when the end of this strand is reached , there place board 1 , tying the end of the colored thread to peg H. However , because board 1 and board 2 are on op posite sides of the reel in order to balance the weight of it , it may not be possible to wind exactly the amount you had planned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reel with a three-yard circumference , you will have to wind ten and one32 A Handweaver 's Workbook half yards . This will be three turns of the wheel plus the yard and a half to get back to the end board . Space the spirals made by the colored thread as evenly as possible on the framework of the reel and mark them with masking tape . This experimental warp end is left on the reel as a ready guide but is discarded when the warp is chained off the reel . 2 . Place your two tubes or spools of warp on a spool rack ( also called a creel ) , or in a deep bowl just as in the first method . Take the two ends and tie them around the peg at the bottom of the reel ( H ) . You can place this board with its end peg at the top if you prefer to have the cross at the bottom of the reel . 3 . Rotate the reel counterclockwise , keeping the two ends of warp separated by your index finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they lay directly next to the colored warp thread , all the way up to the top of the reel . 4 . The board ( 2 ) has in it three dowels or pegs and these correspond to those around which the cross was made on the warping frame . Refer to the sketch of the reel , and guide your warp ends over peg C , under peg B and then straight across to the left of peg A. 5 . Give the reel another spin and carry the two warp ends over peg A across to peg B going over B and under peg C ( just the opposite from the way it was done on the way up ) and thence alongside of the first spirals and up and down the reel until the required 458 warp ends are wound . This means 229 times for we are winding on two ends at a time . Do not let the bands of warp get too wide ; after every few turns of the reel push them into as narrow a width as possible . 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two each ) , as in the warping frame method . When the warp is wound , you will have eight groups of 50 counted and tied plus the last one of 58. 7 . Then tie the cross at a , b , c , d using colored thread , making // the ties snug and using bowknots pulled tight . About four feet from peg C at the place indicated as e , make another very snug tie . This is the choker or brake tie and it will prevent snarls from going down the length of the warp later on . Make ties around the bands of warp at the places indicated by an x mark . The warp is also tied at the beginning and end pegs taking care to catch the first and last loops which were tied around them . Use colored thread for all these ties , make them snug and use bowknots , such as are used when tying your shoes . 8 . Chain off the warp just as was done in the warping frame method . Most warping reels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be careful not to relax the tension of the warp while chaining it or the whole thing will fall down towards the floor and become wound around the place where the reel rotates at the bottom . To prevent this , I stand on one foot while holding the reel from turning too rapidly with the other . Perhaps you can make some sort of a brake for your reel which will eliminate the need for these gymnastics . Reels which are horizontal are available , and I find them much more easy to operate . Some weavers , having gained experience , find it satisfactory to put a warp directly from a horizontal reel on to the warp beam of the loom without chaining it off first . In this event , a brake is necessary or the assistance of another person to put tension on the reel while the warp is being put on the beam . Except for the elimination of the chaining process , the method of putting a warp on a loom directly from the reel is practically the same as described in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the warp has been prepared on the reel with uniform tension so a novice would do well to follow the standard procedures . PREPARING A WARP WITH THE USE OF A PADDLE After you have acquired skill in the preparation of a warp by either of the methods just given , try making one with the use of what is known as a paddle . I suggest you do this only after you have // gained some experience , for the handling of many warp ends at a time in the paddle can be infuriating if they catch on shoelaces , trouser cuffs , skirt hems , buttons , and other nearby things . But there is nothing about this method which you can not master once confidence has been won . With a paddle a number of warp ends can be wound on at a time though sixteen is usually considered the upper limit . Paddles may be purchased but are easily made of soft wood onequarter or a half-inch thick . Fashion the wood into a rectangular piece about two inches wide by six inches long and sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handle like that of a hand mirror if desired . Bore holes into the paddle in two vertical rows as shown in Illustration 7 . You will also need a creel or spool rack like that shown in the chapter on Sectional Beaming . Let us for demonstration pur-poses prepare a warp of 458 ends with the paddle , winding it six warp ends at a time on the warp-ing frame ( though a reel could just as well be used ) . Make this a striped warp ? two blue warp ends followed by four white ones . The reason for putting stripes in your first warp done this way will be explained presently . Proceed as follows : 1 . Place four spools of white warp and two spools of blue on the creel in two vertical rows side by side with the two blue warp spools at the bottom , one in each row . Twenties-two warp may be bought on small tubes of 1050 yards each , but if you do not wish to go to this expense , you must wind off your warp on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have sufficient warp wound on it to complete the entire warp . For a ten-yard warp put on 500 yards per spool which is more than the exact amount // needed but better than not enough . A yarn measurer , such as the one mentioned in the next chapter , is a useful accessory to have for keeping count of the yardage put on the spools . 2 . See that the warp thread winds off the spools from the same direction , either from underneath them or from the top of them . 3 . Thread the ends from the spools one at a time through the holes of the paddle , putting each warp end into that hole of the paddle which corresponds to its place and row on the creel . Tie these ends to peg A of the warping frame . 4 . Put elastic bands around the free ends of pegs A , B , C , and H to help prevent the warp ends from falling off them as the winding progresses . Making the Cross The cross , which you remember occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made on your fingers with the help of the paddle and then transferred from your fingers to these pegs in a process something like making a " cat 's cradle " with string . 1 . Stand with your back to the warping board and draw the paddle towards you along the six warp ends . Hold the paddle so that the two blue warp ends are at the bottom of it just as they are on the creel. 2 . Hold the paddle with your left hand at the same time grasping all the warp ends coming from the paddle on the creel side as shown in Illustration 8 . This puts a tension on the warp ends coming from the board . 3 . As you face the paddle , note that the six warp ends are in two vertical rows coming from the holes of the paddle . There is a row composed of three warp ends in front ( that is , towards you ) and another row of three towards the rear or away from you . ( The sketch shows a paddle carrying ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row is a blue one . 4 . Still keeping your body between the warping frame and the // paddle , place the ball of your right index finger on top of that warp end which is at the bottom of the row near you . It is a blue warp end . Reach under this same warp end with your right thumb , and then place the ball of the thumb on top of the warp end which is coming from the lowest hole of the back row of the paddle . It , too , is blue . Now you have crossed these two warp ends as shown in the sketch . Push them down on your thumb and index finger towards the knuckles ready for the next two . 5 . Reach up with your same index finger and place the ball of it on top of the second lowest warp end on the front row ( white ) . Your thumb then goes under this warp end and over the second lowest one in the other row ( also white ) to complete the crossing of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles . TO PEG A Repeat the same operation with the other two warp ends . Now all six warp ends have been crossed . Transfer them directly from your thumb and index finger to pegs B and C. Those from the index finger go on peg B ; those from the thumb to peg C. This results in a single cross . . . that is , a cross composed // of single warp ends alternating over and under these two pegs . The blue warp ends are the first two of the warp . Push the warp ends well down the pegs . 7 . Still holding the paddle in your left hand , slide it down the warp ends to a place near your waist as you take all six of them in your right hand and wind them on the pegs of the warping frame just as was done in the two-thread method , until peg H is reached . The Portee Cross When using this method to prepare a warp it is usual to make at is end of the warp a second cross called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as the porrey cross . It is at the portee cross that the warp ends are most easily counted . JAake the portee cross as follows : Bring all six warp ends to the top of peg H as usual then make a six warp end turn around pegs I and J and back again to peg H as shown in Illustration 9 . The paddle is not used at all in making this cross but remains in your left hand out of the way . Warping boards commer cially made have pegs pro viding for the making of this second cross , but the sketch shows how the vertical pegs along the side of a warping board may be used for the purpose . Bring the paddle up to peg H then turn the paddle so // that the two blue threads which were on the bottom of it when winding down the board are now on top . It was for this reason that two colors of warp were recommended for this demonstration . Whether the warp is to be a striped one or all one ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . Push the paddle along with the left hand winding on the warp for the return trip until peg C is reached . 4 . Here the paddle is used again to make the cross on the fingers with this difference : this time face the warping board . Keep the paddle in the left hand and use the right hand to cross the warp ends starting at the bottom as before . The first cross made will , due to the turning of the paddle , be made with two white warp ends . When all six have been crossed transfer them to pegs B and C. The warp ends on the thumb go on peg B , those on the index finger are slipped on peg C and all are pushed well back on these pegs . 5 . Bring the paddle over to peg A and as you do so turn it so that the blue warp ends are again the two at the bottom of the rows of the holes , and you are ready to start all over again . Now you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the warp you have caused the blue and the white stripes of warp ends to alternate as they should . If the warp ends become too twisted between the paddle and the creel due to this turning of the paddle , they can be untwisted at either peg A or peg H by reversing the direction in which the paddle is turned . Twists made at these pegs have no effect on the warp 's preparation . 6 . Keep track of the number of warp ends wound by counting the groups of six where they cross between pegs I and J. When you have 76 groups ( 76 times 6 equals 456 warp ends ) break off the four white warp ends . Pull them out of the paddle and tie them to peg A for this is where the winding of 76 groups will have been completed . ( If you had been winding an uneven number of these groups of six , 77 for example , then this would occur at peg J , which actually is the end peg . ) Wind the four slack ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creel. // 7 . Make a cross with the remaining two blue warp ends and slip them on pegs B and C. Then , having wound them on the other pegs and made the portee cross with them , fasten them off and tie them to peg J. This completes 458 warp ends and assures that the warp will be balanced with a blue stripe at beginning and end . 6 . Tie the porrey cross ( the one at pegs B and C ) in four places as usual . 9 . Tie the portee cross in four places where marked on the sketch as e , f , g , and h. 0 . Make any other ties as is your custom . 1 . Beginning at peg A , chain off the warp from the board , leaving it unchained from peg H to J. Reason for Change of Position You , no doubt , wonder why the first cross is made while standing with your back to the warping board when winding down the board and while facing it on the way up . It is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand facing the board when about to Make the cross with your fingers and peg A is at your left , the paddle must be held in the right hand and the left hand used for crosshig the warp ends ... an awkward process for a right-handed person . It was also done to keep the alternation of the warp ends exact . Try doing it while facing the board both on the downward and the iet  --  rn trip and you will see that there is always one place where two warp ends do not alternate on pegs B and C , even though the paddle is turned end for end . This , however , is not really objectionable inasmuch as they could be separated , later on when selecting them for threading . PROS AND CONS Obviously preparing a warp by using more than two warp ends at a time has its advantages . Those who do not like the method , // however , say that they can use two warp ends at once much more rapidly than they can stop to make the cross each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wind warp off on to many , spools . Here again , of course , is a matter of personal opinion . Many experienced weavers , especially those who learned the craft years ago , make the cross on their fingers with a rhythm and speed that is a delight to see . By one method or the other you have prepared a warp which is to be placed on a loom with a plain beam . Further instructions will be found in Chapter 5 . One more thing . Try to finish the preparation of a warp all at one time . If you leave the task and return to it later , there will be a change in the tension with which you hold the warp ends . This causes slack spots to occur in the warp , and these are troublesome when it is being wound on the warp beam of your loom . Indeed , " Finish your warping before night , or sit up nights with your weaving , " is a warning which it is well worth while to heed . Chapter 4 WINDING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sectional beam , you will find that the hr ; iin at the rear is divided into small sections , usually two inches wile , by means of wooden or metal pegs . Or you may have a seclio nal beam as an added feature of your loom , interchangeable with or additional to the plain beam . Each section of this type of beam must be wound separately for the full length of the warp desired . ' 1'liis does away with the need for either a warping frame or a warping reel . In order to wind the warp on the two-inch sections evenly , you test have a tensioner , also called a tension box . It is necessary also wind off your warp yarn on to many spools or to buy it on small usually two-ounce ) tubes . To be consistent , plan to wind on to the sectional beam the same width and length as was mentioned in Chapter 2 , namely , ten yards , 15 inches wide . Use as before a 202 cotton yarn in natural color Sor the warp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total number of warp ends you are going to wind exactly divisible into the two-41 // inch sections of the warp beam . Usually a 20/2 warp yarn is planned for thirty ends per inch so in each two-inch section of this beam there would be sixty warp ends . To wind each section , therefore , would require sixty spools or tubes of warp yarn , each spool containing enough warp yarn to wind the ten yards planned for in each and every section . The trouble is that the 458 warp ends decided upon in Chapter 2 is not a figure exactly divisible by sixty . If you wind seven of the sections with each one containing sixty ends , you will have only 420 ends . If you wind eight sections , you have too many warp ends . Do not wind seven sections with 60 warp ends in each and then wind one more section with only 38 ends in it for the tension of this last section will never match the others . What , then , to do ? There is no objection to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider than the fifteen inches planned for in the reed . In fact , it is a very good thing for there is then less friction on the selvage threads in the reed . Therefore , your solution is to place upon the spool rack fifty-eight spools of warp and by following the directions given wind any two of the sections with 58 warp ends and six with 57 , making 458 in all . You can also , if you prefer , wind eight sections with sixty warp ends each and then later on when you are threading them discard 22 warp ends of the last section . But this is wasteful and the 22 unused warp ends wind around the warp beam , make a nuisance of themselves and have to be cut off from time to time . Here , then , is the way a sectional beam is wound : 1 . First measure the circumference of your warp beam , so you will know how many turns of the crank to make for the desired tenyard length of warp . Perhaps the catalog for your loom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Place 58 spools or tubes of warp yarn on the spool rack ( also called a creel ) so that all the ends coming from them wind off from the same direction , either from above or from below . ( See Illustration 10 . ) Place the creel some distance from the rear of the loom . // 9 . Begin with the lowest spool on the right hand side of the creel , and thread its end through the tensioner . Take the end from the spool above this one and do likewise . When you reach the top of the first row of spools , begin at the bottom of the next . Not all makes of tensioners are like the one shown in Illustration 11 so read the directions sent with yours carefully . On some of them it is necessary to carry the first warp end over the first dowel , under the next , over the third and under the fourth , reversing the process with the second warp end . The tensioner shown , however , has removable dowels so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end as it is taken from the spool is put through a hole in a screen made of quarter-inch hardware cloth , beginning at the bottom of the screen at the left and entering the warp ends one by one in vertical rows . From there the warp ends are taken straight across under all the dowels and then put into the dents of a narrow reed which forms part of the tensioner . When all the warp ends are threaded through the hardware cloth and through the reed , the first and third dowels are taken out , put under the ribbon of warp and inserted into holes in the side of the tensioner , thus exerting the required tension on the warp ends . One advantage of this type of tensioner is its swinging reed which permits you to place the warp ends in the reed of the tensioner one or two to a dent and then , by swinging the reed , // the width of the ribbon of warp strands can be adjusted to two inches or to whatever width is needed to fill the sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging reed , arrange the warp ends in a 2-inch space in the reed which means , as a general thing , two in each dent . Various arrangements are found for the securing of the ten-sion box to a support during the winding on of the warp , but the most usual ones are made to clamp on the slabstock of the loom . When all the warp ends have been put through the reed of the tensioner , tie them all to a long cord or narrow tape fastened to the center of the section you are preparing to wind . Each section must have one of these cords or tapes , all the same length and long enough to extend well up over the slabstock of the loom . They are usually provided with the loom , but if you make your own , use a slender cord doubled . Not all warp beams are turned in the same direction . Some must be cranked clockwise and some counterclockwise . Do n't make the mistake that I did once with a loom that was new to // me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong direction ) Watch for directional arrows on the warp beam or any directions given you with the loom . Lacking these , look carefully to see how the catch works on the ratchet of the warp beam and make sure that when the catch is on , the warp is not going to wind off the rear beam when you pull on it from the front of the loom . Just how far back from the loom to place the creel is a matter for experimentation . Start at about eight feet and if the warp does not wind off the spools freely , increase the distance . Then keep the creel at this same distance all during the winding . As the winding of each section is begun , it is important to see that the strand made up of the warp ends coming from the reed in the tensioner is centered in the section . Most important of all , watch that the warp ends do not pile up in the center of it or slough off at the sides or your tension will not be even . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each section as even as possible . It is better to wind the center sections first , reserving the outer ones , where the selvages will be , for the last . They will be the better for the practice . Be sure , also , to center the warp on the beam , that is , use four sections on one side of the center and four on the other . If you had planned to use an uneven number of sections , this would not , of course , be possible but the warp should be centered as far as possible . 6 . To keep track of the number of yards wound , you can count the turns of the crank . Let us hope there are no interruptions since it is all too easy to lose count . There are , however , different types of counters on the market which are attached to warp beams . There is also a very fine yardage counter available which takes the guesswork out of sectional beaming and is useful also when you are winding the spools or when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn you have . I have found that this yardage counter soon pays for itself . If you do not have a // counter , better count the turns of the beam out loud and place on the warp beam a chalk mark to mark the place where each turn is to begin . 7 . The strand or ribbon of warp coming from the tensioner winds on to each section with all warp ends lying side by side due to the reed provided with the tensioner . There is no way , however , of guaranteeing that the warp ends will stay in this order once they are cut . Therefore , to keep them side by side , when ten yards of warp have been wound on a section , take some masking or other gummed tape and lay it carefully under the strand of warp ends so that the threads are securely stuck to it in order . Then fold the tape over the top of the warp ends to make sure they will remain there . 8 . Cut the ribbon of warp just beyond the gummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ends coming from the reed so they do not snap back out of it . It is an excellent idea to tie them into a knot . Now pin the gummed tape to the section just wound . Mark with pencil on the tape a few cross marks so you will know the upper side of the strand of warp . Move the tensioner along , tie the warp strand to the next long cord , center the strand in the section , and wind on the same amount . 9 . To wind those sections which are to have only 57 warp ends in them , simply remove one warp end from the tensioner and go on as before . Directions for threading a warp put on sectionally are given in Chapter 6 . Chapter 5 SPREADING AND BEAMDNG THE WARP FOR A LOOM WITH A PLAIN BEAM As has been seen , the use of a sectional beam accomplishes two operations at once : the preparation of the warp and the winding of it on to the warp beam . A warp for a plain beam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warping frame or warping reel as described in Chapter 3 , after which it is wound on the warp beam . This is called beaming , and is one step of the entire procedure known as dressing the loom , or the setting-up process . Fearing that they will get the warp hopelessly snarled , beginners approach this part of the setting-up process with a feeling of dread . Several things assure you , however , that your very first warp will go on easily . First of these was the choice you made in the fiber to be used , for cotton is not difficult for a learner to handle . You could have used wool of a well twisted type such as a worsted , but it is wise to avoid linen and rayon for warp until you have gained more experience . The newer man-made fibers ( those known as orlon , dacron , etc. ) can also be successfully handled by a 47 // beginner , as a rule . The second factor which enters into the making of a good warp is the evenness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winding on the frame or reel . Thirdly , care was taken to make a perfect cross , and when the warp was taken off the frame or reel , it was placed in a bag and handled as little as possible . You can , therefore , face your problem with confidence . There is , really , no right or wrong way to beam a warp . Almost every writer on the subject and every weaver uses a little different method , and whichever you find is the easiest for you is the one to use . The method I prefer to use starts out by spreading the warp ends in the reed to the width desired and then goes on to wind it on to the warp beam as follows : SPREADING THE WARP IN THE REED AT THE FRONT OF THE LOOM This is a step which is preliminary to the beaming of the warp and by means of which it is spread out to the width desired , in this instance fifteen inches . If this were not done , the warp during the beaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect weaving , it must wind on smoothly one warp end beside the other . The following steps accomplish this spreading : 1 . Place the bag containing your chained warp on the floor in front of the loom with the cross resting on the breast beam and the loops which were around peg A hanging down on the far side of it . See , however , portee cross , page 63. 2 . Insert two very smooth sticks called lease sticks , provided with the loom , through the cross exactly where pegs B and C were . You can find the place easily because of the ties which you made at a , b , c , and d , of warping frame or reel . Tie the ends of these sticks together securely through the holes there for this purpose , keeping the sticks about two-finger-widths apart . Check to make sure that the lease sticks are exactly where they should be , then remove the four original ties of the cross . // $ . Quite often the distance from the cross to the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than about 12 inches , the loops will pull out of the reed while you are working so the cross will have to be moved down the warp . The easiest way to do this is to have someone hold the warp chain taut at the brake tie while you take those warp ends which are coming over the lease stick next to the end of the warp in one hand and the others in the other hand . Pull your hands apart and as you do so the cross will peel back as far as needed , taking the lease sticks with it . Do not , under any circumstances , untie or remove the lease sticks . The necessity for moving the cross can be eliminated if you make your own warping equipment and see that the distance between peg A and where the cross is made is about twelve or fifteen inches . 4 . Tie or clamp the lease sticks to the top of the breast beam in such a manner that the warp ends can still be moved along them . 5 . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the floor ) tie a heavy cord around the warp chain and then tie the chain to the heel bar of the loom , or if you have a table loom , tie a weight to the warp chain . This puts a tension on the warp to facilitate the spreading through the reed . 6 . Remove the reed of your loom from the beater and lay it flat upon two narrow boards which you have placed , one to each side , from slabstock to breast beam of your loom . To do this you will need to push the heddles aside . If this warp were a very wide one , the harnesses themselves would have to be removed from the loom and laid aside temporarily . 7 . Locate the center of the reed , and tie on a short bit of string to mark the spot permanently or daub on some colored nail polish . 8 . Measure off to the right of this mark seven and one-half inches which is the point where the spreading will begin in order to center the 15-inch width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably be better for you to start the spreading at the // same distance to the left of center . The reed to be used for this warp is a 15-dent reed . Most reeds are marked at one end or the other with the dentage. 9 . Select at the cross where two by two the warp ends go over and under the lease sticks , the first eight warp ends on the right ( or left , if you are left-handed ) . Put these eight warp ends ( two complete loops ) through that dent of the reed which is 7% inches to the right ( or left ) of the center , using the draw-in hook provided with your loom . ( See Illustration 12 . ) Bring the Illustration 12 . A draw-in hook . hook up from underneath the reed through this dent . Loop the ends around this hook and pull them back to the underside . There is an S-shaped plastic reed hook which I prefer to use for this purpose , because the handle of the draw-in hook makes it awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home though any weaving supply house has them . ( See Illustration 13 . ) A silver knife will also work well by laying the warp ends across the dent to be filled and pushing them down through the reed with its blade . Perhaps the two extra warp ends which were tied originally around peg A are at the side of the warp where you have begun . If so , add them to the eight already in the dent . 10 . Continue to spread the warp in the reed by skipping the next // three dents towards the center of the reed . In the fourth dent place eight more warp ends ( two complete loops ) . Always select the warp ends at the cross so that you are certain to take them in their strict order . Pay no attention to the way the warp ends may be twisted beyond the lease sticks , it is the cross which is keeping them in their correct order . Skip three more dents , put eight warp ends in the next ; skip three , eight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width of the warp . You will find it easier to select the correct warp ends at the lease sticks if you pull on the loops of the warp with one hand while doing so , and also if you spread out the warp ends along the sticks . Perhaps there is a mistake in the cross which you have just discovered , so that at one place four warp ends are lying side by side instead of two . Put all four of them in one dent together with four others , to make up the eight . Later on when you are threading your warp ends in the heddles , you will learn what to do with these four ends . When you have completed the spreading of the warp ends as Wove , there will be 30 warp ends in each inch of the reed though , of course , they are bunched . If you find that you have made a few mistakes in counting out the dents in this spreading , it is of no importance . It is important , however , that you select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . The sole object of spreading the warp in this way by placing several warp ends in one dent and then skipping dents is to get the warp spread out to a fifteen-inch width as quickly as possible . It would be a waste of time to put two warp ends through each dent at this stage in the procedure because this spreading is only a temporary one and the warp will be removed from the reed as soon as it is wound on the warp beam . In addition , to put two warp ends through each dent would necessitate cutting the loops . Naturally , you will not always wish to use a 15-dent reed . Suppose you are using a warp planned to have 12 warp ends per inch . You might use a 12-dent reed . To spread this warp you could put // four warp ends through a dent ( one loop ) ; skip three dents . Put four warp ends through the next dent and skip three dents , etc. , all the way across . Fifteen- and twelve-dent reeds are the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , use whatever size you have available for this spreading . If you can not make the arithmetic " come out right , " it is better to spread the warp a little wider in the reed than needed rather than narrower . As for myself , I use for the spreading of all warps ? no matter how many ends per inch ? a reed bought especially for the purpose which has only four dents in each inch . ( An exception will be noted in the discussion of a warp wound with the use of a paddle . ) I poke loops ( I never cut them ) through the dents and skip a dent whenever I think it is necessary , just so that the warp is spread out to approximately the width I need , and preferably an inch or two wider . In place of a reed , you may also use what is called a raddle . A raddle resembles a wide rake , the teeth of which are vertical pegs or finishing nails . The distance between the pegs is usually one-half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves of the beater , and after the spreading is done , the top of the beater comes down over the pegs and prevents the warp ends from pulling out . Others have a top which is hinged at one side so that it can be lowered over the pegs . This type must be fastened in some way to the loom uprights as shown in Illustration 14 . Raddles can be purchased , but they are not hard for a do-it-yourself person to make . In the description which follows , the word reed could also mean raddle. 11 . All the loops hanging from the underside of the reed must now be placed on a smooth stick . . . a yard stick does well for this . In placing the looped warp ends on this stick , it is very important to make sure that they are not twisted . In other words , those warp ends which are going over the lease stick next to the reed must be on top of this smooth stick . Take care , also , to tie on to this stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warp . Now fasten this stick in some way temporarily so that it can not fall out of the loops . // 2 . Go to the rear of the loom and unwind the apron from the warp beam and bring it up over the slabstock of the loom . Aprons , both those on the warp and the cloth beam , are provided with apron sticks that are either threaded through the deeply notched hems of the aprons or attached to them by means of tapes or cords . See Illustrations 15 and 16 . If the beams of your loom do not have aprons , you can staple three long doubled cords to them , putting one at each side and one in the middle of each beam and these will take their place . The ends of the cords are looped around the apron sticks as shown in Illustration 17 . Aprons should be several inches wider than the weaving capacity of your loom , and long enough to reach up over the beams and halfway ( at least ) to the harnesses. // 13 . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a good thing to take the trouble to recount your warp ends while they are bunched just in case you have miscounted in winding them . Unless the variance is very great , it can be taken care of later when the pattern is being threaded . If you have omitted so many warp ends that the finished product will be much narrower than you had planned on , stop here and wind extra ones in the same way that you wound the original ones . Make the cross , tie it as before and chain off the warp . Slip this adH ditional warp on to your lease sticks , one end of which will ' have to be untied to admit them . Retie the lease sticks . Spread these new ends through the reed , and you are ready to go on . // The warp will not be exactly centered in the reed , but perhaps you can push the reed along the groove if there is room . At any rate , this can not be helped now . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can eliminate them , if you wish , simply by pulling them out of the reed . 14 . Put the reed back in the beater . The raddle stays in place , its pegs either covered by the top of the beater or its own hinged top . 5 . Untie the warp from the heel bar , remove the brake tie and unclamp the'lease sticks from the breast beam . ( i . Draw the stick holding the loops of warp towards the rear of the loom . An assistant can be of great help here , for the warp // should be held taut in front . You will probably need to push the lease sticks away from the reed along the warp to make the loops long enough to reach the rear . 17 . Transfer the loops on the yardstick to the apron stick of the warp beam . The apron stick will , of course , have to be taken out of the lacing or hem of the apron and the loops placed a few at a time in the spaces . This is easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hem for the insertion of the apron stick ( see Illustration 16 , showing this arrangement on the front apron ) , because then the apron stick is put into the center tape and the warp loops spaced evenly on either side of it after which the two end tapes are replaced . Be very careful not to twist the loops of warp as you take them off the yardstick . ( See also Illustration 17. ) // 18 . With the warp held taut in front , trace the loops from the reed back to the apron stick with your fingers separating them on the apron stick to see that they are not unduly piled up one on the other and that they come in a straight line from the dents . The width of the warp on the apron stick should be made the same as it is in the reed , or a few inches wider . You now have the warp spaced on the apron stick of the warp beam ; the warp is being held taut in front and the lease sticks are in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lease sticks and the cross from the front of the reed to the rear without losing the cross . I. Move the lease sticks up close to the reed . Turn the one which is nearer the reed on edge , flat against the partitions . Look behind the reed and you will see a little tunnel formed there in the warp . With the warp held taut , thrust through this narrow opening another smooth stick , a lease stick is best if you have one , taking care that it does not catch up any of the warp ends which are on either the top or the bottom of the tunnel . Draw this stick to the rear of the loom and tie it at each side to the slabstock so it can not fall out . You will quickly see that this stick is separating the upper and lower layer of the warp exactly the same as the apron stick is , and it is , therefore , a check on your work . 1 . Untie the ends of the two lease sticks in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on edge ... the one near the reed . 21 . Push the remaining front lease stick up to the reed so that it is on edge with its flat side against the reed . Hold it there securely while your assistant shakes the warp gently . It may even be necessary to give the warp a few quick spanks with the flat side of another smooth stick both in front and behind the reed , but be careful lest the lease stick at the reed fall out . Keep the warp taut , and the warp ends behind the reed will again separate into a little tunnel . Into this carefully insert a lease stick , making certain that those warp ends which are on top of // the lease stick at the front of the reed are also on top of this stick which you are inserting . In other words , the new lease stick must go through the tunnel without picking up any of the warp ends from the bottom of the tunnel . 22 . Push this new lease stick back to the other one tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ends of them just as the original lease sticks were tied . Remove the remaining front lease stick from the warp . The cross is now at the rear of the loom in perfect order just as before . While it is true that some weavers do not transfer the cross until later on when the warp has been wound on the warp beam , it has been my experience that students are likely to forget about it with disastrous results . So better do it now ! The warp is now ready to be beamed or wound on the warp beam . BEAMING THE WARP This method of beaming a warp requires the assistance of at least one other person , and in my classes we are in the habit of calling this person " Horsey . " Horsey must hold the warp so that it is taut and must pay special attention to the selvages ( outer warp ends ) to see that they are not slack . Here is the procedure : 1 . While Horsey holds the chain of warp , it is untied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the better in the case of a cotton warp . Some fibers , especially linen , need to be put on the beam more gradually , however . The warp is then kept taut , shaken out well and , if there are still inequalities , it is spanked hard with a smooth flat stick using the flat side to strike the warp . Yes , the warp is actually spanke , across the width of it ! You will be surprised how this makes a warp behave . Let the reed or raddle in the beater lean agains the breast beam . If the raddle is of the type that must be tied to the loom uprights , then , of course , it remains there with its hinged top securely in place . // 2 . Start cranking the warp beam . Most looms require that you wind towards the rear or clockwise , but check carefully the instructions sent with yours . If you have nothing to guide you , wind on a few inches and put the catch on the ratchet of the warp beam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loom and if it is wound correctly the catch will prevent the warp from unwinding. 5 . Watch those lease sticks ! They must not disappear down over the slabstock and get wound in the warp . Keep pushing them back towards the harnesses every once in a while . 4 . Horsey must hold the warp half in one hand , half in the other , and hold it so that the tension feels even all across the width . Horsey also stands directly in line with the center of the reed or raddle. 5 . As soon as the apron stick begins to wind on the warp beam , place over it a sheet of paper upon which the warp can wind . Do not use newspaper as it is not tough enough but the large garment bags from the dry cleaner 's are excellent for the purpose . They must be cut several inches wider than the warp , for you must always have a good margin of paper extending beyond the edge of the warp . It is better to use short lengths of paper as longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side of the beam and too narrow at the other . With a cotton warp it is safe to make one or two revolutions of the beam with no paper between . Insert another sheet of paper , keeping it smooth and unwrinkled . Some weavers use old blueprints for this purpose and flat , smooth sticks like yardsticks are also satisfactory being inserted at the rate of about four sticks to a revolution . Separating the layers of warp in this manner is necessary because otherwise the warp ends will sink into the previous layer , making ridges as the warp is wound . Each ridge changes the circumference of the beam , making differences in the tension of the various warp ends . 6 . As the warp is beamed , Horsey exerts a pull on it and gradually // is more or less pulled toward the reed . The warp ends must not slip through Horsey 's fingers but be held firmly . Considerable tension is thus put on a cotton warp though a wool warp would be put on much more lightly . 7 . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of the warp , unchains more of it and shakes it out . Then the warp is spanked again and the winding continues . All during the beaming Horsey keeps an eye on the beater , for if it starts to move backward , the beaming must stop immediately until the tangles there are straightened out . Sometimes in spite of all precautions , bad tangles do occur in front of the reed or raddle . Have near at hand , therefore , a fairly stiff scrubbing brush and if the tangles will not spank out , brush them towards Horsey who then grasps the loose ends and draws them back . When the warp is smooth for as long a distance as possible , wind on a little more , then brush again . Brushing is not recommended except when there are many tangles and should never be done in the case of a wool warp . Usually these tangles result from not keeping the tension uniform during the preparation of the warp on the frame or reel , and it requires patience to beam such a warp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp end should break during the beaming , tie the ends of it together again , inserting a short piece of the warp yarn , if necessary , to make it long enough . Later on in the weaving , all knots in the warp must be eliminated by treating them as if they were broken warp ends . ( Page 93. ) 9 . Beam on the warp until the looped ends in Horsey 's hands reach the reed . Now tie the lease sticks to the slabstock so that they can not fall down . 10 . Take a few of the loops in front of the reed and cut them . Pull them out of the reed and tie them together in a slip knot near the lease sticks . ( See Illustration 18 , slip knot . ) Continue to cut and tie in groups until all have been removed from the reed . 11 . The reed or the raddle can now be removed from the loom and // laid aside , for you are ready to thread your pattern . See Chapter 6 . BEAMING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , not all of us are so lucky ! Do not be dismayed , however , for beaming can be done alone . That part of the process which particularly requires the aid of another person , not necessarily a weaver , is the holding of the warp at a tension while it is being cranked on the plain beam . It takes it little " know-how " to beam a warp alone , but the following method has proved satisfactory time and time again for me : Take a heavy cardboard carton and near the bottom of one side punch a hole large enough to slip the end of the chain of warp through . In this carton place a weight . The floors of my classroom are made of a slippery composition material , and the looms are heavy ones so I need two old varnish cans filled with sand , each one weighing sixteen pounds . The weight needed , of course , varies with the nature of the floor or its covering , the warp fiber , and the loom . Spread the warp through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have it all ready for beaming . Take the chain of warp coming from the front of the reed or raddle and insert the whole thing through the hole in the side of the box . Unravel as much of the chain as you wish and // inside the box place a shuttle or smooth stick through the last loop of the chain to prevent it from unravelling any farther . 4 . Notice that in Illustration 19 , the lease sticks have not yet been transferred to the rear . Many weavers prefer to leave them in front like this and , as the warp is wound on , they move the lease sticks along the length of the warp . It works excellently if the warp has been prepared on the warping frame or reel with care to keep the tension even . But I am always afraid that I will forget to transfer the cross before I cut the loops when the beaming is completed , so I make a practice of transferring the cross as described . Of course , if a raddle is used instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , after the beaming is finished , is to lift off the top of the raddle and remove it . The lease sticks , holding the cross , can then be pushed to the rear of the loom . This is the big advantage of using a raddle . Place the box on the floor far enough from the loom so that the warp is stretched out taut and untwisted . Feel the warp and // then move the box from one side to the other until both the selvages and the middle of the warp have the same tension . 6 . Wind on the warp as usual , dragging the box , weight , and all across the floor . Unwind some more of the warp chain and continue , always checking the tension from time to time . While this does require considerable going backwards and forwards from back to front of the loom many times , a warp winds on surprisingly easily this way . The last yard or so is the hardest . To help with this part , you can remove the breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up close to the loom , it is sometimes a good idea to put it on a chair , and pull box , chair and all , in order to finish the job . Wide warps are prepared in two halves and chained off separately . ( See page 30 . ) In this case , one chain is placed in one box and the other in another box . A pair of lease sticks is used with each chain . See that you have the same weight in each box and that the tension of each is uniform . That 's all there is to it ! BEAMING A WARP PREPARED WITH THE USE OF A PADDLE A warp which has both a porrey cross and a portee cross ( see Chapter 3 ) presents certain deviations in the procedure of beaming which are included in the following directions : 1 . Place a pair of lease sticks through the second or portee cross at the places previously occupied by pegs I and J of the warping board or the corresponding pegs of a reel . Tie the lease sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Put the raddle in place . It may fit into the groove of the beater or be fastened to the loom uprights , whichever is suitable . Fold over the top of the raddle 's rakelike projections a piece of heavy paper . 3 . Bring the lease sticks to the rear of the loom over the top of the raddle , having first pushed the heddles out of the way . 4 . Take the apron stick and thread it alternately through the first tab of the apron hem on the warp beam then through a group // of the loops at the end of the warp , then through another tab of the apron and through more loops of warp until the warp ends are all evenly distributed on the apron . This is the same procedure as described in ( 17 ) on page 56. 5 . Tie the warp chain at the heel bar on the floor level in front of the loom so that the unchained part of the warp is at a tension . 6 . Remove the paper from the raddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the slabstock. 7 . Place the groups of warp ends coming by sixes ( or whatever the number of warp ends you used with the paddle ) into the spaces of the raddle . Be sure you do not cross them as they come from the lease sticks to the raddle . See that the warp is centered in the raddle and that it is spread out to the width desired or , better still , to an inch or two wider . You may need to place two groups of six in some spaces or to skip spaces in order to do this spreading . 8 . Place the top on the raddle. 9 . Check to see that the warp ends on the apron stick are spaced out to the same width as they are in the raddle. 10 . Unfasten the warp chain from the heel bar and also any other ties made in the warp at the time it was prepared . 11 . Wind the warp on the warp beam with paper or thin slats between the layers as is your custom . Some weavers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp , others push them ahead . 12 . When the first or porrey cross comes up to the raddle in front , the lease sticks behind the raddle are removed if they have not been allowed to go on the warp beam . 13 . Insert lease sticks in the porrey cross just as usual . 14 . Remove the raddle from the loom . Push the lease sticks back to the slabs tock and tie them there . 15 . Cut the loops of warp and tie them into small groups using a slip knot . This completes the beaming , and the loom is ready for threading . Chapter 6 THREADING THE PATTERN , SLEYING THE REED , AND LACING ON THE WARP TO THE CLOTH BEAM While I feel sure that anyone who has a loom and has woven on it will know how to thread a pattern , the new weaver will need this information . In the first place , a weaving pattern is known as a draft , and , for some reason unknown to me , drafts are read from right to left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for a small pattern called Rose Path which is suitable both for borders and for all-over pattern weaving . // As a weaver sits in front of the loom , the harness before him or her is called the first harness , and they are numbered in order from front to back . Some looms , as has already been said , have more than four harnesses while some have only two . In a weaving draft the numbers between the lines ( though sometimes x 's or oblique lines are used instead of figures ) refer to harness numbers and indicate that a warp end is to be threaded through a heddle on that harness . Frequently squared paper is used for draft writing . However , before you can actually start to thread your warp in the Rose Path draft , there is some paper work which you must do in order to fit the draft into the number of warp ends you have wound . Rose Path is a very small draft with but eight warp ends in each repeat of the design ( Diagram 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp ends in it , 8 of which were reserved for the selvages ( page 20 ) , you have available 450 warp ends for the draft itself . Divide the number of warp ends required for one repeat of the draft ( 8 ) into this number and you will find that there can be 56 repeats of the draft in the total of 450 warp ends plus two warp ends left over . Do not ignore these two warp ends for , to make your calculations come out even , one of them will be used at the beginning of each selvage . Selvages are generally threaded 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 for the right hand selvage and reversed , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 for the left . For a selvage which is not written in this manner , you might like to turn to page 133 to see the draft given there . It is a special instance , however , and not applicable here . Now the draft for Rose Path looks like this with the selvages and the two extra warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to left . // Let us thread this draft together . Some weavers prefer to sit at the rear of the loom to thread , others in front . When two people work together , the one in back hands the warp ends to the one in front of the loom who then threads them . It is easier for the one in front if the breast beam is removed . To facilitate the threading , you will find it well to write down the figures in the draft in lines so that you can read them in the customary manner from left to right like this : If you found when a recount was made on page 54 that you have a few more than 458 warp ends , the selvages can be further in-creased . Suppose you have two extra warp ends or 460 in all . Line A would then read 3.4.1.2.3.4 and line D would read 4.3.2.1.4 . It is not correct drafting ( except as noted in Part 2 ) to have figure 1 follow figure 3 or figure 2 follow figure 4 or to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two 1 's and this is the reason why the enlarged selvage in line A begins as it does . The explana tion of why this has to be done is given in Chapter 8 for such threadings form what is there described as a flat . Place the above data somewhere on your loom ? one copy at the rear and one in front if two people are working together so that they can check on each other . There are three procedures to follow now depending upon the type of warp beam you are using : THREADING THE PLAIN BEAM 1 . Take the first two warp ends of the cross at the lease sticks ( left-hand side of the loom as you sit at the rear ) . Separate the two cut ends but do not remove them from the lease sticks . // Put one of them ( either one ) through the first heddle of harness number 4 which , you will remember , is the harness at the rear of the loom . Put the other one through the first heddle of harness number I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared with a paddle , you will find that the warp ends are separated one by one instead of two by two at the lease sticks . ) If you are working by yourself , simply use your fingers and thread the warp end through the eye of the designated heddle . When you have an assistant at the front of the loom , hold the heddle while your helper puts the long-handled draw-in hook through the eye of it . Loop the warp end over the hook after which it is drawn through to the front of the loom . The warp ends should be long enough so that they will not be pulled out again accidentally and some of the warp 's length may have to be unwound from the warp beam to accomplish this . As each heddle is threaded , it is pushed over to your left . 2 . Select the next two warp ends at the cross as before , separate them and put one through the eye of the first heddle of harness number 2 and the other through the first heddle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making sure that they are the next two of the cross . Take one of these and put it through the eye of the second heddle of harness 4 . When you sit at the rear of the loom you are thus threading the heddles from left to right one after the other using the harnesses called for in the draft . The threading of these first five warp ends completes Line A , page 67 . Tie these five warp ends in a slip knot in front of harness 1 . 4 . Put warp end number 6 through the eye of the second heddle of harness 1 and continue to thread line B , always selecting the warp ends where they cross over and under the lease sticks . All drafts are threaded in this same manner . 5 . When you have threaded four repeats of the draft , tie all these warp ends into one slip knot in front of harness 1 . Now check your threading . In these four repeats there should be eight // heddles threaded on each of the four harnesses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ) . Make any corrections necessary before continuing with the threading . It does not matter if you have left a heddle empty by mistake just as long as the required 32 heddles are correctly threaded . Check also to make sure that you have not omitted any warp ends at the cross and , of course , ascertain that they have been chosen in their correct order . 6 . Now count off the next eight heddles on each of the four harnesses and tie off all the others . This will be a check on your threading of the next four repeats . The warp ends already threaded are tied with a slip knot . You must not make a single mistake in the threading or it will have to be redone , so constant checking is essential . 7 . When you have threaded the 56 repeats of line B , follow the directions of line C by threading the next warp end to a heddle on harness 1 which balances the first repeat of the Rose Path draft . 8 . Finally , thread line D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counted correctly , this will use up all your warp ends . 9 . If you have made an error anywhere in the forming of the cross when the warp was being prepared there will be at that place four warp ends lying side by side at the lease sticks instead of the usual two . The only thing to do is to select them in the order which you think is correct . This may mean that these four warp ends will become twisted around one another for the entire length of the warp so that they may have to be untwisted by hand as the warp is moved forward when weaving . This is the reason why only two warp ends were used at a time in the preparation of the warp in Chapter 3 . THREADING THE SECTIONAL BEAM When a warp has been beamed sectionally , the method of threading is essentially the same except for the fact that there are no lease // sticks and no cross made . A sectional beam is threaded as follows : 1 . Unpin the tapes from all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are long enough so that when they come up and over the slabstock to be threaded through the heddles they will hang down in front about 8 inches . Then by means of masking tape fasten each section of the warp to the upper part of the loom in the rear , i.e. , rear of roller V in the frontispiece , making very sure that none of them is twisted from the section . The pencilled " X " marks which you made on the tape on which the warp ends are stuck will help guide you . 2 . Begin to thread the first section at the left of the rear of the loom by pulling off the first warp end on the left of the tape and threading it exactly as was described for the plain beam loom . Follow with the second , third , and fourth warp ends , etc. , selecting them in the exact order in which they were gummed in place . Take care not to twist the ribbon of warp as it comes from the section at any time during the threading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next until all are threaded . 3 . If you should make a mistake in the threading making it necessary to pull warp ends out of the heddles , remember you have no cross so be sure to stick them on to a piece of masking tape for re-threading. 4 . From here on everything is the same for either type of beam . THREADING THE READY-SPOOLED WARP BEAM Many of the table looms are equipped with a warp beam which is a hexagonal steel rod upon which spools of warp purchased already wound are slipped . Some floor looms have these beams as extra equipment . On the face of it , it would look as if this type of beam would be a very great advantage to have and , as far as being a labor and time-saver , it is . These beams are therefore commonly used in schools and for Occupational Therapy . However , the yarns which may be purchased on ready-warped spools are limited to a very few : // carpet warp , 20/2 cotton , and 40/2 linen and they entail quite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beam , place each spool on it un opened with the arrow pointing toward the front of the loom and with all the arrows lined up . Break the seals on the spools and bring the warp up over the slabstock , unwinding enough from the spools to reach through to the front of the loom . Then fasten each ribbon of warp to the rear of the loom at the top . Each spool represents a two-inch width of warp in a 15-dent reed . The thread ing is similar to that of a sectionally wound warp , for you begin at the left spool on the beam at the rear of the loom and thread each warp end of each spool one after the other as you take them off the gummed tape . The amount wound off from each spool must be exactly the same . When you buy warp wound on these spools , there are sixty warp ends on each spool of the 20/2 cotton and the 40/2 linen warp and thirty ends per spool of the carpet warp . Spools may be purchased in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest looms using this type of warp are the 8-inch " Structo " looms which hold four spools of warp . Because many people have these small looms , it would be wise to figure out a warp plan just this wide for the Rose Path draft , using the 20/2 cotton . Four spools each with sixty warp ends means a total of 240 warp ends . The Rose Path draft , having 8 warp ends in each repeat of it , will fit into this total number 29 times with exactly 8 warp ends left for selvages . Thread the first selvage 1.2.3.4 just as was done before on page 66 and write it all down in lines like this : The second selvage is reduced by one warp end , but this is im material . // Many table looms hold ten spools though the loom does not have to be warped to its full capacity . If you wish to use on such a loom the 458 warp ends as planned originally in Chapter 2 , put eight spools of warp on the hexagonal beam and follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spool will not be used . These unthreaded warp ends must be cut off from time to time as weaving progresses for they get in the way . SLEYING THE REED After the threading by any method is completed , the warp ends are again put through the reed , this time to stay . This process is called sleying . Place your 15-dent reed upon two narrow boards placed from front to rear of the loom so that the reed is flat and parallel to the breast beam as it was during the spreading . This is the way to sley a warp through the reed : 1 . Take the first two warp ends that you threaded and put them through that dent of the reed which is 71/2 inches from its center . Start at this distance because the warp must be centered in the reed and it was planned to be 15 inches wide . If you are left-handed , perhaps it would be easier if you started at the other side of the warp . 2 . Take the next two warp ends and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed . Do not skip dents . The draw-in or reed hook , the S-shaped hook or the blade of a table knife can be used when sleying a reed in the same manner as described in Chapter 5. 3 . Continue to select the warp ends by twos , placing two in each dent of the reed . Make sure that the warp ends are not crossed or twisted as they exit from the heddle eyes . 4 . Every inch or so pull on the warp ends hanging down under the reed and inspect your work closely , making certain that there are no skipped dents and that each dent has two , and only two , warp ends in it . It will certainly save you a great deal of time to be careful now to get the sleying correct . // Tie the ends underneath the reed about every two inches in slip knots so they can not pull out . When the warp is sleyed all across , replace the reed in the beater with all the slip-knotted ends hanging down in front of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are now in the reed thirty ends of warp per inch . LACING ON THE WARP The next step is to fasten the warp ends coming from the reed to the apron stick as follows : 1 . Take the first bunch of warp ends and untie them . Gently stroke the warp ends towards you to pull out inequalities in the tension . Look to see that they are all smooth where they come through the lease sticks behind the harnesses , or from the sec tions of a sectional beam ( making sure none is caught around a peg ) , or from the ready-warped spools . If the latter , it is wise to use a brush to smooth out the warp at the spools where it may have piled up during the threading . Then retie the bunch of warp ends with a hard knot close to the cut ends , and do like-wise with the next bunch and so on . These bunches do not necessarily need to have the same number of warp ends in them . In fact , it is well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed ) at the beginning and ending of the sleying to assure good tension for the outside edges while the other bunches can measure about an inch and a half in the reed . Try not to split the ends which are together in a dent by tying them in // different bunches . These knots do not need to be in perfect alignment , either , for the next step will take care of that . ( The bunches of warp ends are also called bouts. ) 2 . Take a piece of strong cord about three times as long as the width of the warp and begin to lace the bunches of warp on to the apron stick of the cloth beam by tying it first to the right hand side of the stick near where the first bunch of the warp ends will be as it comes straight from the reed . The apron stick should be about three or four inches from the breast beam . 3 . Bring this cord from above down through the center of the first bunch of warp ends at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cord under the apron stick and up over it and then down into the middle of the next bunch of warp ends , pulling the cord and holding it so that these two bunches are held taut . There should be about two inches left between the apron stick and the knot of each bunch to allow for later adjustment . The three figures which show the methods of attaching an apron stick to the apron ( see Illustrations 15 , 16 , and 17 ) also show the lacing on of the warp . These sketches are idealized , for we do not often get the knots at the end of a warp in quite such an even row . 4 . When all bunches have been laced on , adjust the tension across the entire warp by pulling on the cord between the bunches until your sense of touch tells you that the tension is the same . This is most important , and care should be taken that no part of the warp feels tighter or slacker than the rest , after which the lacing cord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . The lease sticks which are still in place behind the harnesses can be left there , tied loosely to the slabstock , or they may be removed entirely . However , if you intend to change the threading of this warp before it is all used up , then the lease sticks which are holding the warp ends in order would better be left in place . There is no cross in a warp wound sectionally or // on ready-warped spools , therefore , no lease sticks . To learn how to insert them , should you ever desire to re-thread your warp , continue to read on and then follow the instructions which are given on page 90 . Chapter 7 TYING UP THE TREADLES Before any weaving can be done on a floor loom , the treadles must be tied up in order to operate the harnesses . Most floor looms have six treadles . Above these are four levers which are called lamms , and above the lamms are the four harnesses . ( See Chapter 1 . ) Each harness is fastened to the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snitch knot ( see Illustration 21 ) , or with hooks . When the lamms have been tied or fastened to the harnesses , they should be in a horizontal position with respect to the floor and the harnesses , themselves , together with the lower and top rollers ( U and V ) must be level . Next the lamms , in turn , are tied to the treadles so that by stepping on the treadles the harnesses are put 76 // into motion . The tie-up , therefore , is from treadle to lamm to harness . The system used to tie up the treadles varies with the weave , but for a simple draft such as Rose Path and indeed for many , many others , including the old coverlet patterns and all the overshots , there are two main systems in use today . The first of these ( Diagram 3 ) is the one preferred by Mrs. Mary M. Atwater , whose text The Shuttle-Craft Book of American Hand-Weaving has been a standard for many years . NOTE : Part Two of this book explains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begin at the first treadle on the left ( as you face the front of the loom ) which in this instance is called treadle number 1 . Through a screw eye on this treadle ( the first screw eye towards the front ) run the loop of a doubled length of cord . Draw its ends through its own loop , thus securing the cord in the screw eye . Tie another length of cord into a loop long enough to come halfway down from the first lamm to the floor . You will soon find out whether this cord is the right length once the knot to be described is tied . Fasten this doubled cord into the screw eye on this first lamm ? the screw eye which is directly above the treadle . Bend the loop back upon the two strands of this cord coming from the lamm , then take the two ends coming from the treadle , and insert them into this loop . ( See Illustration 21 . ) When these two ends have been tied together in a simple overhand knot , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot . This knot seems to be unique to the weaver 's craft . It does not jam under tension and can easily be adjusted up or down by untying and adjusting the overhand // knot . When you were hanging the harnesses and followed the directions given in Chapter 1 , you also used this snitch knot . The angle at which the treadles are tied up from the floor should be such that , when operated with the feet , the treadles sink a distance equal to half the length of one of your heddles . The snitch knot , being easily adjusted , allows you to tie the treadles temporarily now and to change the angle later if necessary . Remember that while the treadles are being tied up , the lamms , the harnesses , and rollers above them must be kept level and horizontal . To continue with the explanation of Mrs. Atwater 's tie-up : Put another doubled cord through the next screw eye of treadle number 1 and tie it also by means of the snitch knot to the second lamm using that screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the one on the first lamm . Treadle number 1 ( first on the left ) has now been tied to lamms 1 and 2 , which means that it is also indirectly tied to harnesses 1 and 2 . This is what is indicated by the two x 's on treadle 1 of Diagram 3 . Treadle number 2 , as shown by the x 's , is tied to lamms 2 and 3 ; treadle number 3 to lamms 3 and 4 and so on , twelve knots being needed in all . In this tie-up , treadles A and B are the ones that are used to weave without pattern in what is known as plain weave or tabby . Treadles 1 , 2 and 3 are operated one at a time with the left foot and the others with the right . MR . WORST 'S TIE-UP OR , AS IT IS MOST OFTEN REFERRED TO , THE WORST TIE-UP Diagram 4 shows the tie-up given by Edward F. Worst in his book en-titled Foot-Power Loom Weaving . The same knot is used , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabby treadles are in the middle ( num-bers 3 and 4 ) . One system is as good as the other . Explanation of Diagram 4 // My classes use the Worst tie-up because it seems easier to alternate the feet when weaving tabby . In Mr. Worst 's tie-up treadles 1 , 2 , and 3 are operated one at a time with the right foot and the others with the left . ( See Illustration 22 . ) These tie-ups are for the four-harness loom which has a sink- the opening made in the warp ing shed ( page 14 ) . A shed is when the treadles are operated . If your loom is one that has a rising shed ( page 15 ) , you can still use either system of tying up the treadles with this difference : In place of using the x 's as guides for the tie-up , use the blank spaces . In other words , Diagram 3 would have treadle 1 tied to lamms 3 and 4 instead of 1 and 2 , etc . Floor looms with four treadles instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given below : When the direct tie-up is used , it is necessary to use two treadles at a time to accomplish the work that one treadle can do in the other two tie-ups . For instance , in the Worst tie-up treadle num-ber 6 is tied up to harnesses 1 and 4 . To use these same harnesses with the direct tie-up , you will have to use treadle number 1 and treadle number 4 together . This requires the use of two feet at the same time , but if one is agile , one foot can straddle two treadles if they are adjacent as in the case of treadles 1 and 2 , for instance . This produces a rather rolling motion of the hips which may be its greatest advan80 A Handweaver 's Workbook tage ! On the other hand , it is sometimes necessary to make use of three harnesses simultaneously , and this is more easily done with the direct tie-up . It is also possible with the direct tie-up to operate the harnesses one by one . All cords used for tie-up purposes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaving supply houses handle cord for this purpose . If you do not have ready access to such supply houses or in an emergency , buy a hank of what is called " mason line " from a hardware store . This braided cord , while a little stiff at first , will do very well . Upholsterer 's cord can also be used . Table looms , being without treadles , have no tie-ups and the harnesses are operated by means of hand levers . For an explanation of how to change the treadling directions given for a floor loom into those for a table loom or other rising shed loom , see Chapters 9 and 10 . Chapter 8 PUTTING IN A HEADDNG AND " TROUBLE SHOOTING " Large wedge-shaped spaces will be seen between the groups of warp ends where they are laced in front . To make these disappear , several rows of plain weave are woven , using alternately treadles 3 and 4 of the Worst tie-up , Diagram 4 of the previous chapter , and very heavy material for weft . This is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension of the warp . There is on every loom a foot or hand lever or other means of adjustment which moves the warp forward and also a ratchet with a catch or dog , or a brake of some sort which holds the warp in place at the tension desired for weaving . ( See Illustration 24 . ) The warp should be fairly taut but not to the extent that the harnesses will be hindered in their operation . On the other hand , it is impossible to weave if the warp is too slack . It will be necessary for you to experiment to arrive at the tension which seems best for good work for you . To put in a heading , take some very heavy material ? rag strips , rope or anything else that comes to hand . It can be pushed with the hands through the opening called a shed which you make in the 81 // ra warp by stepping on treadle number 3 ( the Worst tie-up is used from now on ) and by holding it down with your foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick ) shuttle . It is not necessary to fasten in the weft at the selvages in this operation . Weft , you will remember is the name given to any of the threads which cross and interweave with the warp . If you are using a table loom , pull down levers 1 and 3 together for your first row of weaving . Bring the beater against this row of weft , thus beating it in place . Step on treadle number 4 , or pull down levers 2 and 4 , releasing treadle number 3 or hand levers 1 and 3 , and put in another row of the coarse weft . Beat this row in place . The weft can be in lengths long enough to go through the shed and hang down at the selvages for a few inches , or it can be a continuous piece . Continue to use treadles 3 and 4 alternately this way until the wedges disappear . As you do so , watch carefully to see that no mistakes have been made in your setting-up process , for this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , you have made a mistake in the sleying of the reed in spite of all your precautions , either by crowding too many warp ends in one dent or by skipping dents , there is nothing to do but to take out the heading , the lacing cord , and the knots and remove the warp out of the reed to the nearest selvage and then to re-sley it . So scan the top of your tabby sheds closely . If you see a place where there is a space wider than the rest , you have skipped a dent . If you see a place where there are two or more warp ends coming from one dent when the shed is opened , you have probably crowded the warp ends there . Crowded or skipped dents will make streaks in your material which no amount of beating or laundering will hide . // Crossed-over Warp Ends A warp end which does not rise or fall as the treadles are used but remains in the center of the shed in front of the reed has been crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily remedied once the offender has been found . There are two warp ends involved , in fact , one crossed over the other . Break them off at the knot , add on a short length of warp to each one , put them through their correct dents , and then tie them around the lacing cord at the knot in any way , just so that the tension is the same as the others . Misthreading of Draft Mistakes in threading are more unfortunate but should not be too serious since you have checked your threading carefully as you went along . Sometimes , however , a warp end which should be on harness 3 , for instance , is found to be on harness 2 . This forms in the shed what is called a flat , that is , two warp ends side by side rise or fall together in the shed when plain weave is treadled on treadles 3 and 4 , so that the weaving is imperfect . To repair a flat , take the warp end out of the wrong harness , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of carpet warp or other strong thread more than twice as long as your heddles , tie a string heddle on the correct harnesses and in the correct place . Rethread the warp end through this string heddle , re-sley it in the reed , tie on a short bit of warp yarn to make it long enough , and with a pin anchor it as shown in Illustration 23 . To tie a string heddle , first make what is called a doup by centering this piece of heddle cord under the bar of the harness where the string heddle is to be tied . Tie a square knot with the two ends so that the knot comes in line with the lower part of all the eyes of the other heddles . Tie another square knot above this one on a level with the top of all the eyes of the heddles , thus making an eye in the string heddle . ( See square knot , Illustration 20 , page // 73 . ) Then tie the ends on top of the heddle bar at the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie should not bind the string heddle to the bars of the harness , for it must be able to slip along them as the other heddles do . Thread the warp end through the eye of the string heddle . The unwanted steel heddle remains in the harness for it will not interfere with the weaving in any way . Weaving supply houses stock snap-on repair heddles which are very useful in such cases for they obviate the necessity of tying on a string heddle . Omission of a Threading Suppose you find that you have completely left out one thread of the draft . This also causes a flat to occur in one of your tabby sheds . Do n't pull out the entire threading ! Wind some of the warp yarn on a spool or on one of the bobbins which fit into your boat shuttles and use this to take the place of the warp end which was omitted , tying in a string heddle for it on the correct harness , or using a repair heddle . Now , of course , you will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra warp end after which it is anchored in front with a pin . In addition , you will need to add weights ( metal washers or dress weights are good ) to the bobbin hanging down over the slabstock until you have it at the same tension as the others . This can be ascertained once you begin to weave for if the warp end looks puckery in the cloth , it is not weighted enough ; too tightly drawn , and it needs less weight . Weighted warp ends hanging down behind the slabstock may look untidy , but they work and that is the main thing . ( See Illustration 23 . ) Now is the time also to adjust the length of the treadle and harness cords up or down , until the lower part of the open shed just comes in contact with the lower edge of the reed in the beater . This permits free clearance for your shuttle to pass through the shed . On a counterbalanced loom the harnesses and the reed should be at such a height that when a warp end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heddle , into a dent of the reed and thence over the breast beam in front , it is horizontal , parallel to the floor . On a loom with a rising shed , however , you will note that the manufacturer has adjusted the harnesses so that the warp is about one inch lower at the heddle eyes on the smaller looms and two to three inches lower on the larger looms , than it is at slabstock and breast beam . Better sheds are obtained on these looms when this is so . ( See also Chapter 10 , Adjustment of the Harnesses . ) Chapter 9 THE WEAVING ITSELF You are now almost ready to weave , though it still is necessary to wind some bobbins , also called quills , with weft . For your weft you can use , if you like , the same thread as was used for the warp , though in that case it will be called weft . On page 107 , you will find a discussion of bobbin winders which are a necessary part of a weaver 's equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us suppose that you are using a paper quill which is a tube about the diameter of a lead pencil and about 3% inches long . Place the quill on the tapered shank of your winder , and tie the end of the weft to it with the beginning of a surgeon 's knot ( Illustration 20 , page 73 ) . This , as seen from the sketch , is only the well known overhand knot with the free end of it tucked in again . It holds the weft in place once the winding begins and is easily released when the bobbin is empty . Or you can merely wind the weft a few times around the quill to hold it in place . Put your weft in a can or other suitable container on the floor under the winder so that it can not roll all over the place while you are winding . 86 // Weft must be wound on a bobbin so that a little mound about a quarter of an inch from the left of the bobbin is formed , taking great care the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out towards the left end . When a mound has been wound at one side , shift to the other and wind in similar fashion . Then fill in the center . A well wound bobbin feels hard and firm and is about three-quarters of an inch in diameter . It is a mistake to fill bobbins too full . Just as surely as you allow the weft in winding to fall off the mound towards the outside end of the quill , you are going to have trouble . The weft then will start to slide off the quill and when it is placed in the boat shuttle will wind around its shank . This will stop the smooth progress of the shuttle as it is thrown through the shed . A bobbin of linen weft is particularly hard for a beginner to wind because linen is so wiry . Indeed , linen must be held in the fingers with so much tension while the bobbin is being wound that it almost burns them , and even so linen tends to fall off the ends of a bobbin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winding should start at one end and take the form of a cone with ' the tapered end towards the center . Then wind the other end of the spool in like manner , leaving a depression in the middle which is not filled in until the last . Unless a bobbin is properly wound , you can not expect to do good weaving . It is , therefore , very important that you practice winding bobbins until you can produce one that has all the characteristics mentioned above . BEGINNING TO WEAVE From all that has gone before , you can see readily that a weaver does most of the hard work before sitting down at the loom to weave . Now for the fun of weaving ! First , it will be necessary and very important that you as a beginner practice plain weave , or tabby . By means of the long-handled // or long-pedalled catch on the rear ratchet , release the tension on your warp and bring some of it forward by pumping up and down with the handle of the front catch . Recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warp should be kept for weaving . Do not move so much warp forward that the reed in the beater will not be able to touch the last row of your heading . Indeed , you should form the habit of moving the warp forward frequently while weaving and of weaving only within about a three or four inch space , thus keeping the angle at which the beater strikes the last row of the weaving more constant . Place the bobbin you have wound into one of the boat shuttles so that the weft comes from under the bobbin and out through the hole or slot in the side of the shuttle . Hold the shuttle in your right hand with this hole or slot towards you and the flat side of the shuttle towards the reed . ( See Illustration 25 . ) Depress treadle number 3 ( Worst tie-up ) with your right foot , // holding open the shed and throw the shuttle from right to left through it in front of the reed . Fasten the end of the weft as shown in Illustration 26 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( counterbalanced or sinking shed loom ) or raised ( jack type or table loom ) . On a table loom use hand levers numbers 1 and 3 both together . Hand levers are numbered from front to back . Catch the shuttle with the left hand , holding it in the same way as before . It should never be necessary to reach in after it , for the impetus given the shuttle should be just enough to send it flying through the shed . This comes with practice . Grasp the beater in the center of the top ( D in the frontispiece ) with the right hand and give a sharp beat to the row of weft ? a beat , not just a squeeze . The nature of // the beat differs with various fibers , wool being beaten lightly ; linen is given a heavier beat . Change to treadle number 4 ( hand levers 2 and 4 pulled down on a table loom ) . Treadle number 4 is used with the left foot and while still holding down the treadle , beat once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center as before . Now the upper and lower parts of the shed have changed places ; those warp ends which were on top before are now on the bottom . Throw the shuttle back through the shed to the right , catching it with the right hand . Beat this second row of weft using the left hand on the center of the top of the beater ( handtree ) . Change to the other tabby shed by using either treadle number 3 or levers 1 and 3 together as the case may be and beat again . Throw the shuttle through this open shed back to the left again to be caught with the left hand . Continue in this way until an even rhythm has been established , saying to yourself as you do so : throw , catch , beat , change , beat ; throw , catch , beat , change , beat . . . over and over again . Notice that in throwing the shuttle and treadling the loom you are using your left hand and left foot together and your right hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not bend down to look at your feet . It is an excellent idea to wear lowheeled shoes or only socks when treadling a loom . For those of you who have sectional beams or are using readyspooled warp , lease sticks can now be inserted in the warp . While they are not essential to the weaving they will keep the warp ends in perfect order should you wish at any time to change the threading of this warp to another draft . To insert lease sticks , open one of the tabby sheds and push a lease stick through the shed which is formed behind the harnesses . Move this stick to the rear of the loom . Open the other tabby shed , insert another lease stick , also behind the harnesses and move this stick to the rear . Tie the ends of these sticks together and then tie them loosely to the slabstock . You will see that the warp ends are now going over and under the lease sticks one by one thus keeping them in perfect threading order . The Weaving Itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from narrowing or drawing-in at the selvages , the weft should be left loose in the shed just before beating it and placed in the shed at an angle as shown in Illustration 27 . If this is not done , the strain of drawing in becomes so great that the selvage threads break and the reed may be damaged . Drawing-in occurs because the weft in the shed is crimped by the interweaving which takes place between warp and weft and which shortens the latter , causing the material to become narrower than the width of the warp in the reed . No amount of fussing or pulling at the selvages will cause them to become wider , once they are drawn in , so form the habit of placing the weft in the shed at an angle and do not pull on the weft with the hand that holds the shuttle . Some draw-in is bound to occur , but strive to keep it down to a minimum . The beater must be grasped in the center because if not , your rows of weft will not lie parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other . Good Selvages At first your selvages will appear as if mice had been gnawing at them and often it happens that one selvage looks better than the other . There is , indeed , no royal road to good selvages , for they come with practice and experience . There are , however , some ex92 A Handweaver 's Workbook cellent hints about the winding of bobbins and the making of good selvages given in the article entitled " Your Selvage is Showing , " written by Bill Carter which appeared in Volume 3 , No. 1 of the Handweaver &; Craftsman . The Shuttle Craft Guild Bulletin for August 1948 has some excellent suggestions . ( See Bibliography . ) FASTENING THE WEFT When weft in the bobbin runs out , never tie on the new to the old . Simply keep the shed open in which you were weaving . Insert the shuttle with its fresh bobbin through the shed in the same direction in which you were going . Then allow the end of the weft coming from your bobbin to overlap the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter to a half inch is plenty for most wefts unless the warp ends are sleyed far apart . Bring the two ends up through the warp on top of the shed and let them stick up there . Continue to weave for an inch or so , then cut the ends off close to the surface of the weaving . They will hold . It is well to do this piecing near one selvage or the other where it is away from the center of interest . ( See Illustration 28 . ) A knot in weft is cut out and treated the same way , never woven in . Very heavy wefts should be frayed out at the ends so that where they overlap at the join they are not too bulky . When starting to weave with a heavy rug filler for instance , separate the end coming from your shuttle into its separate strands for about four inches . // Eliminate one of these strands by pulling it until it frays off . Now when the remaining strands are run back into the shed as shown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable . Do this same thing at the end of the piece of weaving . When your shuttle runs out and you wish to continue with the same weft , separate the strands , fray out and discard one strand from both the old and the new weft so that where they overlap in the shed the join will be neatly made . To fasten in the weft at the end of the weaving , do not leave it dangling from the selvage . Instead , after you have thrown the shuttle for your last row , keep your foot on the treadle , thus holding open the shed . Cut the weft and bring it around the outside selvage warp end . Next , bring the weft back into the shed for about a half inch and put it up through the warp on the upper part of the shed . ( See Illustration 29 . ) This is also the way to finish off a bobbin when you wish to change to another color . BROKEN WARP ENDS When a warp end breaks ? alas , they do break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . First , measure off a length of warp yarn long enough to reach from the breast beam to the slabstock with some extra for tying . Working from the front , put the new length of warp through the space left vacant in the reed when the old warp end broke . If you have sleyed the reed two ends to a dent as described in Chapter 6 , then find the dent where one of the pair of // warp ends is missing and put this new warp end through it from the front of the reed . Pull this new warp end almost completely through the reed and then take the short end and anchor it around a pin placed in the woven material directly under the break . ( See Illustration 30 . ) Thread the long end of this warp end through the heddle which you find either to be empty or still holding the broken original warp end ( which should be taken out of the heddle ) . Draw the new warp end to the rear of the loom and tie it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use a bowknot , keeping the tension of this substitute warp end the same as all the others . During the weaving from here on watch this bowknot to see that it does not interfere with the making of a good shed by getting tangled up in the warp . Untie it frequently and retie it back at the slabstock . The broken end of the original warp thread in front of the reed is wound around the pin with the new warp end , that is , if it is long enough . Continue to weave to the end of your piece or until you can undo the bowknot and bring the original warp end coming up from the warp beam back to the front by threading it through its heddle and dent in the reed . The warp end which you substituted can then be pulled through to the front of the reed and clipped off leaving , // however , enough to thread on a needle later . Anchor the original warp end on a pin in front , and test it with your fingers to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old warp end and the new must be darned back in for a short distance by means of a needle , or else there will be a weak spot in the material . When this is done , the two ends can be clipped short . WHAT WENT WRONG ? To weave well in tabby is the test of a good weaver . Watch your work carefully . Are there streaks across the width of the warp every once in a while ? You are probably not beating evenly or perhaps you are not being careful to adjust the tension at the dog and ratchet so that it feels the same every time you move the warp forward . If there are loops left by the weft at the selvages , you are not pulling on the weft enough , or perhaps you have it placed in the shed at too much of an angle . If you find that you are drawing the warp in too much , start over by putting in a few rows of coarse weft to spread the warp out again . Carpet warp used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strive for good rhythm in weaving ( throw , catch , beat , change , beat ) . If you find that your rows of weft persist in running uphill at the selvages , you have tied the outside bunches of your warp too loosely to the apron stick in front . On the other hand , if your weft turns down at the selvages , these outer warp ends have been tied too tightly to the apron stick . Selvages are meant to be drawn in a little closer together than the balance of the weaving so do not have them too open . You can see the reason for the statement that there is no. royal road to good selvages ! WEAVING WITH TWO SHUTTLES To weave the Rose Path draft which you have threaded ( Chapter 6 ) , you will use other sheds than just the two for tabby and you will need to use another boat shuttle in addition to the one you have been using . Thread this second shuttle with a bobbin wound // with a coarser weft than 20/2 , such as crochet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , and in color . Call this shuttle B. The other shuttle carries a finer weft , 20/2 cotton , for instance , in natural to match the warp . This is shuttle A. Before and after each row of the pattern weft ( colored ) there is thrown a row in tabby or plain weave using shuttle A. These tabby or binder rows , as they are called , are not written down in directions given for weaving because a weaver understands that they are to be woven . However , for the sake of the beginners , let us note down the com plete treadling directions for Rose Path , using only one of its many , many treadling possibilities . These directions are for the sinking shed loom and the Worst tie-up . Rising shed floor looms make use of the same directions but you must remember to have your treadles tied to the blanks of the tie-up . And begin again from the beginning , repeating over and over this little variation for an all-over pattern . Notice that both shuttles are started from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Illustration 26 . Note , also , that the treadles used for the binder rows with shuttle A alternate 3 , 4 , 3 , 4 , etc. , and that when you are using treadle 3 the shuttle is always thrown from the right and // when you are using treadle 4 , the shuttle is thrown from the left . The treadlings used with the other shuttle , however , may find it either at the left or at the right . This is true of all two-shuttle weaving . If you are already a weaver , the only directions you will need for this are those for shuttle B as follows : Treadles 1 , 2 , 5 once each . Treadle 6 twice . Treadles 5 , 2 and 1 once each and repeat from the beginning . Table looms have rising sheds but no treadles so substitute for these directions as follows : Refer to the Worst tie-up , page 78 , and you will see that the levers used for the table loom which correspond to treadle 1 for instance are the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanks of the tie-up , i.e. , 3 and 4 . This is because the table loom has a rising shed . The above conversion table holds true of any directions given for a sinking shed loom which you wish to change over for the rising shed looms . It is true that you can use the regular counter-balanced or sinking shed treadling directions on these looms without any change-over , but the material will be woven wrong side up . Variations on the Rose Path pattern come as a result of experi tnent . You can treadle in any order you wish . You can repeat a treadling as many times as you wish and the binder rows used with shuttle A will hold them in place . You can introduce different colors in the weft ( and in the warp when it was planned , of course ) . You can weave without any binder rows at all , but in this case you can not repeat a treadling twice in succession unless you catch the shuttle around the outside warp end for , unless you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can vary the texture by the use // of dull and glossy fibers , bumpy and smooth fibers , etc . Try using a coarse white or natural weft for the pattern rows with shuttle B and put colored 20/2 in the other shuttle for the tabby rows . A sampler made on the Rose Path treadling is a most satisfying project , as has been demonstrated by Berta Frey in Seven Projects in Rose Path . See bibliography . Rose Path was chosen for this threading only as an example of a small , easily understood and easily threaded draft . It is not within the scope of this book to enter into a discussion of pattern drafts . The bibliography has a list of many fine texts in which they may be found . RULES OF THE DAY Before you leave your weaving for the day , it is a good habit to ease the tension on your warp just a little . If you are using a cotton warp and live in a damp climate , you will be very wise , indeed , to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen or more warp ends have been known to snap during the night just on this account . Now is also the time to insist that nothing be placed on the warp of your loom and , of course , to put nothing on it yourself , not even your shuttle for any length of time . Why it is that people seem to think warps are good places to lay books , coats , hats , etc. , I do not know , but I do know that you must be firm on this subject , and get the family started off right from the very beginning . A warp that has sagging places in it because things have been laid on it is very sad indeed . Chapter 10 A FEW POINTERS At the risk of seeming repetitious , let me recapitulate a few things before you are left to your own weaving devices . ADJUSTMENT OF THE HARNESSES Theoretically , the harnesses of a counterbalanced loom should be hung so that after being threaded , sleyed , and tied , the warp will come through the reed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is nothing more annoying to a weaver than to have the bottom of a shed so ragged that the shuttle catches in the warp ends there . For this reason in actual practice , the height of the warp in the reed should be adjusted until , when the sheds are open , the lower part rests on the bottom of the reed . This is brought about by adjusting the length of the various cords used to tie up the harnesses , lamms , and treadles . The use of snitch knots makes this easy to do . If the construction of your loom permits , the reed may be raised or lowered in the beater until the bottom warp ends in the sheds just touch the bottom of the reed . You must , however , watch to see that the warp is still in a straight line from the breast beam to the slabstock or the two sides of the material will differ , 99 // the warp predominating on one side , the weft on the other . But , as a rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the warp at the bottom of the reed when a shed is open , and still have it in a straight line when the shed is closed . Although this does increase the friction on the warp ends , it is desirable to have the warp this way for reasons stated above . I do not advise that you change the cords , etc. , of table looms and other rising shed looms for they have left the factory in working order and are much too complicated for a novice to adjust . REEDS AND THEIR CARE Why is a reed called a reed ? In olden times reeds were just what their name indicates ? actually made with flat reed strips for partitions and with twine wound between them to keep them spaced apart . Naturally , these old reeds were not as accurately made as the ones we have today . Reeds vary in size for home use from 4 to 40 dents to the inch . The size of each reed is usually stamped upon it . Those most commonly owned by handweavers are the 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use these coarser reeds and put several warp ends through each dent for the finer materials , rather than to use fine reeds since the more partitions a reed has , the more friction there will be on the warp ends . In addition , should you ever wish to tie on a new warp to an old one ( thus saving yourself the task of rethreading the draft ) , you will quickly see the advantage of using a coarser reed when the knots slip through the dents so easily . Then , too , some of us find that our eyes are not as good as they used to bel Ridges which sometimes are noted in the woven material as a result of sleying several warp ends in a dent disappear in laundering . When you buy a reed , get a long one and then cut it into the length desired with a hack saw for then you can have two reeds for just a little more than the price of one . While a standard reed is 4% inches high , most beaters are adjustable to accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily film , you // must clean them well before use . A carbon tetrachloride spot remover , which you can get at drugstores and hardware stores , cleans them readily . If a reed is very badly rusted , there is nothing much that can be done for it . The use of steel wool and plenty of " elbow grease " will usually take care of slightly rusted ones . If you find that your reeds are rusting , it will pay you to buy stainless steel ones . One method of determining how many ends of warp to put in each inch of a reed is to wind some of the warp around a ruler , covering in this manner an inch space without crowding the warp thread . Count the number of times it was necessary to wind in order to fill the inch space , and then use less than this figure ? the mill practice is to use about half the number . Of course , there are excellent thread charts to be had which will also give you these figures . See page 167 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign languages , especially Swedish , and in them directions for sleying the reed are given in the metric system , a common one being " 88 per 10 cm . " Ten centimeters is about four inches , so this would call for a reed with 22 dents per inch . In this country a 12-dent reed is more available so use this instead , placing two warp ends in each dent . Two extra dents per inch will not usually make too great a difference . If a reed is not to be used for some length of time , it should be put away in a dry place . Lay it flat to prevent it from warping out of shape . When the storage is to be for a long time , a light coating of machine oil or kerosene will keep it free from rust . There are also sprays to prevent rusting of reeds . Versatility of a 15-Dent Reed A 15-dent reed is a good all-around size to have for it comes in handy for many articles of weaving . The following table , prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Penland School of Handicrafts in Penland , North Carolina , shows what can be done with it . // THE WARP PLAN While many times a weaver winds on a warp of a certain yardage and keeps on weaving until it is used up , there are at other times special projects which require closer figuring . How is this done ? Let us suppose that you wish to weave a luncheon set consisting of eight place mats and eight napkins , all to be woven on the same warp , with the mats 12 X 18 inches finished and the napkins 12 x 12 inches . Start off by figuring as follows : But if you wind only this amount of warp , you will never have enough to weave this set because there will be shrinkage both in the weaving and the laundering . Always remember to take into consideration that the amount of woven material is less than the warp wound . Just how much less varies so much with the yarns , beat , tension at which the warp is kept during the weaving , sett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends per inch ) , the weave you are using , and the finishing ( laundering , etc. , ) that only experience will tell you how much to allow . Realizing all this , better count on an average amount of shrinkage which for cotton warp is 10% and for linen would be 15 % . In addition to this , there should be an allowance for tying the warp to the cloth beam in front at the apron stick and for the fact that there is always quite a bit of warp between the harnesses and the slabstock which at the very end of a warp can not be woven . A yard more warp will take care of these two items very generously . Then there is need for extra warp length to take care of your experiments and to enable you to adjust the beating correctly . Adding these things we have : Now , how wide will you need to make this warp ? The mats and napkins are to be 12 inches wide , finished , but this does not mean 12 inches wide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you already know . Just how much to allow for draw-in varies , for in addition to the factors already mentioned above in connection with the shrinkage in length which apply here also , there is also the personal equation to be considered because some weavers habitually draw in the width of woven material more than others . An inch allowance will be about right until you learn to control your draw-in . This is largely a matter of establishing good rhythm in weaving as was described in the last chapter . With regard to handwoven yard goods , there is usually allowed three inches per yard of width for draw-in , so that a 36-inch mate rial in the reed will produce usually not more and sometimes less than 33 inches finished . This reference to finishing of yardages does not mean merely the hand laundering which you give to the mate rial but refers to the commercial process known as finishing whereby // worsted and woolen materials are thickened or fulled before they are fit to be made into garments . Oftentimes this finishing process is partly done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaps , after which they are dry cleaned . For excellent accounts of the weaving and finishing of handwoven wool and worsted yardages , see Roger Millen 's book Weave Your Own Tweeds , and the Shuttle Craft Guild Bulletins for November and December 1952 . Both sources are mentioned in the bibliography . This matter of the finishing of handwoven yardages is a very important one , because good weaving can be ruined by poor finishing . Inasmuch as the shrinkage can be considerable , it is always wise to take the time and trouble to make a short sample warp , about 18 inches wide , weave it and finish it or have it finished to ascertain how the material is going to look and whether it is suitable for your purpose . Returning to the subject at hand , to weave this luncheon set you have found out that you will need to prepare a warp ten yards long and thirteen inches wide in the reed . How much warp yarn should you , therefore , order ? If the material is to have , let us say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goods ( a frequent calculation for finer table linens ) , you will need 30 x 13 or 390 warp ends in all . Each end will be ten yards long so you must have at least 3900 yards of warp yarn at hand . If you decide to use a linen warp , choose a 2-ply warp yarn known as 40/2 . This has 6000 yards per pound . Or , if you choose cotton , a 20/2 cotton warp yarn which has 8400 yards to the pound can be used . You will find on the sample cards which you receive from supply houses that the yardage per pound of the various yarns is stated . Both the 40/2 linen and the 20/2 cotton are fine yarns and usually set at 30 warp ends per inch in the reed . How much weft will you need ? If your luncheon set is to be woven in a linen weave such as those known as " M 's and 0 's " or a " Bronson , " then in each inch that you weave of the warp there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of weaving and you would have to adjust your beating accordingly . This is what is // known as square count ( because there are as many rows of weft per inch as there are warp ends per inch ) , and the amount of weft needed would be about the same as that required for the warp . The reference above to various weaves will become clear to you as you follow the explanation given in the second part of this book . If you choose a linen thread for weft ( and sometimes linen weft is used on cotton warp yarn ) , buy the single-ply linen of the corresponding size of your warp . This is because a single-ply linen is much less expensive than the plied linens and is softer , less wiry , so that it beats in better . A size 20/1 linen weft is the equivalent in grist ( size ) of a 40/2 linen warp yarn and can also be used on a 20/2 cotton warp . Size 16/1 linen weft , which is just a little coarser , also works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen weave , such as those mentioned above , but wish to weave in an allover pattern using color and a draft such as Rose Path , for instance , the best rule to follow is : Buy plenty ? dye lots differ ! For pattern weaving it is usual to use two wefts , as you already know , the finer for the tabby shots and a coarser , colored one for the pattern as was explained in the last chapter . The tabby rows are often woven using the same thread as the warp while the pattern rows may be woven with a number of different wefts including six-strand floss , crochet cotton , carpet warp , and wool . Linen as a weft for pattern weaving does not beat in well so it is not generally used . When you measure the length of your place mats and napkins on the loom as you are weaving , remember to allow that extra 10 per cent or 15 per cent to the overall length of the piece . In other words , place mats on a 20/2 cotton warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches for hems must be woven not 20 inches long but 22 inches long . It is better , also , to make your measurements with the tension off the warp . Thread Sizes , Yardages per Pound , Etc . Many weavers are puzzled about the yardage they may expect to find in each pound of the yarns they are using and also about what // the different numbers mean on the labels , so perhaps a discussion of these items will not be amiss here . Cotton and linen yarn , both in the warp and the weft yarns , are designated by numbers to show their grist , that is , their size . They may be purchased as single-ply or they may be plied , so we have 2-ply , 3-ply , 4-ply , etc. , yarns . Speaking of identical fibers of the same ply , the higher the number , the finer the thread . A 20/2 in linen or cotton is , therefore , finer than a 10/2 . At the mill , these fibers are spun so that there is a definite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-ply yarn from a single-ply yarn the length , that is , the yardage of the fiber per pound , is doubled upon itself and the two strands are then plied or twisted together in the spinning . Therefore , you can see that a 20/2 yarn , for instance , will have but one-half the number of yards in each pound that the 20/1 fiber has . Given the size of the yarn or , as we say , the count and knowing the ply , you can by the use of a simple formula arrive at the yardage per pound . For cotton the formula is based upon the fact that a pound of No. 1 single-ply ( 1/1 ) yarn contains 840 yards . There-fore : For linen the formula is as follows . It is based on the fact that a single-ply No. 1 linen yarn contains 300 yards per pound . This amount is known as a lea . Solving for 40/2 linen , you have : 2 // Woolen and Worsted Yarns The situation with regard to these yarns is complicated . Zielinski 's Encyclopedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in determining the count and yardages per pound . In the United States , however , the most frequent terms encountered with regard to woolen yarns are cuts and runs . A cut of No. 1 single-ply woolen yarn measures 300 yards and weighs one pound . The term run is used in another system . A run of No. 1 single-ply woolen yarn weighs one pound and measures 1600 yards . Worsted is a hard-twisted , smooth-surfaced yarn spun from longstapled pure wool and is so combed that its fibers lie parallel to each other . The term may also apply to a similarly spun mixed yarn . The unit used with reference to this yarn is called a count . Each count of single-ply worsted yarn measures 560 yards and the number of the yarn depends upon how many counts of single-ply yarn there are in a pound . Silk , rayon , and the newer fibers of nylon , dacron and orlon are finding favor with many handweavers nowadays . In order to eliminate all the confusion concerning the various systems in use of numbering these different yarns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from concerns which cater to handweavers because they mark the yardages and sizes of their products . But if you wish to go further into the matter , I would refer you to Marguerite Davison 's A Handweaver 's Pattern Book , especially in the revised edition and Harriette J. Brown 's Hand Weaving for Pleasure and Profit . Both of these treat the subject in considerable detail . ACCESSORIES Bobbins and Bobbin Winders There are good bobbin winders on the market , both manual and electric but various homemade substitutes have been devised . The shaft of one of her electric mixer attachments has been in use by one weaver of my acquaintance for many years just for this pur108 A Handweaver 's Workbook pose . Another has rigged up a winder by using the bobbin winder of the sewing machine . If you wish to have an electric winder made , use a motor of about 1600 to 2200 R. P. M. ( revolutions per minute ) such as an old sewing machine motor and have a machine shop fit a tapered spindle on it so that your bobbins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) About three-quarters of an inch diameter is sufficient to wind a paper bobbin for it is a mistake to wind them too full . When winding , hold the weft tightly so that it almost burns your fingers . This is necessary especially when winding linen . When using a wool weft do not wind more than enough bobbins to use up at once because wool soon loses its elasticity under tension . A wool warp should be woven off as soon as possible for this same reason . Our great-grandmothers called bobbins quills , for in those days they were really made of goose quills . Today we usually buy bobbins and they are made of cardboard or plastic . You can , how-ever , make satisfactory bobbins yourself . Take a rectangular piece of fairly stiff and smooth wrapping paper , having the diagonal of the rectangle shorter than the metal shaft in your shuttle . Start ing at one corner of this paper , wind it around the shaft of the bobbin winder . As you do this , insert the end of your weft and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their bobbins while plastic or wooden spools with flanges are now on sale in supply houses . Shuttles There are shuttles large enough to hold rag strips for rug making , but most users of four-harness looms prefer the smaller boat // shuttles for both tabby and pattern wefts . Boat shuttles with rollers are more suitable for looms having a shuttle race than with those that do not have this added feature on the beater . ( See Glossary ) . Whether the bottom of the shuttle is open or closed is a matter of preference . Some table looms have narrow sheds , and for them it pays to buy the special small boat shuttles which some supply houses sell . Heddles Almost all looms made nowadays have either flat steel or round wire heddles and they should be rustproof . " Old-timey " looms all had string heddles and for some warp yarns string heddles with their large eyes are very useful . They are also less expensive , for you can make them yourself . Make a pattern , called a jig , like Illustra-tion 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually 1 inch long . If , when you threaded the hed dles on to the steel bars of your harnesses , two of them were crossed , do not use either of them when threading your patterns The skipped heddles will no affect your weaving in any way unless you are using a great many warp ends to the inch . CONCERNING THE LOOM ITSELF The modern loom for hand weavers is different from thos used in ancient times , althoug the principle is the same . Paint ings found on ancient potter from Greece shows us that their looms were vertical as are the Navajo Indian looms and certain art looms used today . We know that the // looms in use in Egypt about four thousand years ago were horizontal and that they had wedge-shaped pegs at the top of them which were driven into the ground , because in the Cairo Museum there is a miniature model of a weaving workshop which was found within the tomb of a Steward of the Royal Palace . It gives us a picture of the daily life of weavers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shown preparing the flax , spinning it , making a warp on pegs on the wall , just as we do today , and weaving on one of their horizontal looms . When weavers ask what size of loom to buy , the only possible answer to give is in the form of a question : Where do you live and what do you intend to weave ? Small apartments probably mean that a table loom or a small folding loom would be most suitable . But if space is no object , then for general use a 36-inch loom is good to have . On the other hand , if you intend to weave drapery and coverlets , then buy a wider one , 45-inch width at least . For most weaving , the question of whether to buy a rising shed loom ( most of which are jack-type ) or a sinking shed loom , known also as a counterbalanced loom , is largely one of personal preference . However , if you expect to weave linen and use the Bronson weave , for instance ( see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loom with the rising shed because the harnesses of this type of loom do not operate in pairs as do those of the counterbalanced loom . Bronson weave is a type of weaving which requires the use of three harnesses simultaneously and also of a single harness by itself . The harnesses of a counterbalanced loom operate in pairs and they do not readily respond to irregular tie-ups . However , this objection to the counterbalanced loom has been overcome by one manufacturing concern which now makes a shed regulator which is easily attached to their looms . Whether it can be used with other makes , I do not know . The question of whether to buy a loom with a sectional beam or not has already been discussed in a previous chapter . Just introduce this subject into a group of weavers and the discussion pro and con will last far , far into the night ! Sectional beams certainly do away with a good deal of the work of preparing a warp and // make it easy for one person to do it alone . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a plain beam by anyone who is working without assistance . The best solution to this i , roblem would appear to be the purchase of a sectional beam in addition to the plain beam and to use it when and as you see fit . The beater of a loom may be suspended from above or fastened below near the floor . Some manufacturers offer both models . Looms used in Europe , especially those in Scandinavia , have the former type as a rule , but in this country we seem to prefer the latter . No matter where the beater is hung , however , form the habit of moving the warp forward frequently and do not weave too close to the reed since it is better to weave within a three or four inch space . This assures that the angle at which the beater strikes the last row of your weaving will remain more constant . Counterbalanced looms may have their harnesses suspended in various ways . One is by means of what are known as horses which . tre more commonly found on old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood suspended by ords coming from pulleys in some such fashion as shown in Illustration 33 . They take the place of the rollers already described . Edward Illustration 33 . Attachment of harnesses by means of horses . Snitch knots are used to tie the horses to the harnesses. // F. Worst in his Foot-Power Loom Weaving , shows illustrations of this type of harness suspension . If the harnesses work together , they are all right , but all too frequently , at least in my experience , they do not , causing the harnesses to tilt until they look like signals at a railway crossing ! When harnesses are suspended by means of pulleys in place of rollers , the cords often slip down between the pulley housing and the wheel and become so badly jammed that they have to be cut . The most satisfactory method of harness suspension , therefore , is the one already described in Chapter 1 . When rollers are used the movement goes through their full length so that they and the harnesses always remain horizontal . The height of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or building a loom for it should be just high enough to allow your elbows to rest on it as you sit at the loom . Of course , this may be a question of the height of your loom bench . Because there is nothing more fatiguing than to work at a loom which is not the proper height for you , it pays to buy the loom bench along with the loom . Swedish weavers are emphatic in saying that a loom can not be less than 72 inches from front to rear . While this distance is an exaggerated one in the opinion of most weavers over here , it is true that too short a distance will not produce good sheds . I have seen some looms where the space from the breast beam to the harnesses was very short while that from the harnesses to the slabstock was long . Keep this in mind : The nearer the harnesses are to halfway from back to front of the loom , the better . Whether the treadles are better fastened in front or in the rear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , better leverage is obtained , but the treadles then often wobble from side to side , making it difficult to find them with the feet . When the treadles are attached at the heel bar this difficulty is overcome , though the weaver does have to reach farther towards the rear of the treadles with the feet for good leverage . Some manufacturers overcome this by extending the fixed ends of the treadles out from // the heel bar . This arrangement of " organ type " treadle is very satisfactory and can be seen on the loom shown in the frontispiece . Most four-harness looms have six treadles so that by tying each one to a combination of two harnesses the usual weaving directions can be followed . This has already been explained in Chapter 7 . When a loom has but four treadles , they are tied singly to a harness through the lamm directly above the treadle . Two treadles are then used together to make the necessary harness combinations . It makes no difference whether your loom has four treadles or six , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make trouble for themselves worrying about tie-ups . When you copy a pattern draft , look for and copy down the treadle tie-up that was used . If it is not the same as your own , transpose it . Remember , it is the harnesses that are important , not the number of the treadle . If the directions call for harnesses 1 and 1 , then use treadle 6 of the Worst tie-up , etc . If directions are given that call for treadle 2 and you see that their tie-up has this treadle attached to harnesses 3 and 4 , then all you do is use the treadle of your tie-up that pulls down harnesses 3 and 4 , which in the Worst tie-up is treadle 5 . This is assuming that the directions given are for a counterbalanced loom . When the directions tell you that they are for the jack type or rising shed loom and you have a counterbalanced loom , transpose as follows : For harnesses 1 &; 2 use harnesses 38c 4 or treadle 5 ( Worst ) " 2 &3; " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " 1 " 1 &4; " " 2 &3; " " 2 Or , if you wish , you can use their directions weaving the material wrong side up . The tabby shots do not need to be changed . For a table loom , any directions given for the rising shed loom will weave the material right side up . The levers are numbered from front to back and when they are pulled down , the harnesses rise , just as they do on a rising shed floor loom . In Chapter 9 , directions // were given for transposing sinking shed or counterbalanced loom treadling directions into those for a table loom . We usually say that the lumber in a loom should be of hardwood . Yet many an old loom is still in use today which is made of softwood . However , should you be making your own loom , choose well-seasoned lumber which is free of knots and clear-grained . Mortises and tenons in the construction of a loom were mentioned in Chapter 1 . Today the tendency is to use bolts , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . There is the added advantage that they have no wooden tenons to bump your shins against . Many looms come equipped with aprons , but some do not . You can easily make your own , following Illustrations 15 and 16 on pages 54 and 55 , or you can use the method of attaching long doubled cords shown in Illustration 17 . Aprons make a neater job of it and are to be preferred to cords which will make unsightly ridges in your first piece of weaving on a warp . Weavers very often forget to take into consideration the noise that a loom may make . The thump , thump , thump of a loom beater is to the weaver a pleasing sound , but it may be most annoying to others in the household . Sponge rubber cemented at the points on the loom uprights where the beater strikes will often bring peace to the family . Walking looms are also a nuisance for some are inclined to travel all over the room . You can buy loom treads to put under the corner posts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tacked around the posts like little boots work just as well . Together we have come a considerable distance along the road to good weaving . I hope that you have found it a pleasant journey and that you will wish to continue as my companion for the rest of the way . Part Two is to " grow on . " Happy weaving ! PART TWO A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS WEAVES FOR FOUR-HARNESS LOOMS " The lyf so short , the craft so long to learn . " Chaucer Chapter 11 THE TWILL WEAVE The simplest threading possible on a four-harness loom is twill . This is also the threading used when you wish to weave en tirely in plain weave . Twill on four harnesses is usually threaded 4.3.2.1 all across the width of the warp or 1.2.3.4 all the way across . Twills are characterized by diagonals called wales going across the fabric . The best known four-harness twill is the 2 ? 2 twill , the figures referring to the number of skipped threads on the two sides of the material . It is produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ( i.e. , treadles 1.2.5.6 Diagram 4 , page 78 , the Worst tie-up ) and is usually woven with one shuttle only and no tabby . If you desire to change the direction of the wales , change the order of tromping to 6.5.2.1 . Another twill is the 3 ? 1 twill with the opposite side of the fabric a 1 ? 3 twill . The tie-up on page 118 is for the 3 ? 1 twill , and is threaded , woven , and treadled the same as the 2 ? 2 twill . The tabby treadles ( 3 and 4 ) are not as a rule used . A Handweaver 's Workbook This tie-up is for a counterbalanced loom with a sinking shed . For a loom with rising shed ( table , jack type , etc. ) and also to weave the 1 ? 3 twill uppermost on the counterbal-anced loom , use the blank spaces of this tie-up . If you use the tie-up intended for the counter-balanced loom on the rising shed loom , the 1 ? 3 twill will be uppermost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wales changes where the threading of the draft is reversed , as follows : Herringbones may be tromped the same as the 2-2 , 3 ? 1 or 1 ? 3 twills . Broken twills and broken herringbones are those in which the diagonals do not appear because the order of tromping is broken up by transposing the order of use of two of the treadles , as for instance , when tromping treadles 1.2.6.5 of the Worst tie-up , Chapter 7 . Mixed twills and herringbones are is woven , there is seen at each point of , the design a three-thread weft skip . These skips are often undesir-able , especially in upholstery material , because they may catch on clothing so a threading known as a dornick twill is often used which eliminates them . In dornick twills the diagonals still go in opposite directions , but they do not meet to form a point as they do in herringbones . Opposite is a draft for a dornick twill . Notice . that there is a threading of a harness omitted between warp ends number 2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this way , , the skips are eliminated . The Twill Weave Dornick twills are usually woven by tromping treadles 1 . 2. 5 and 6 ( Worst tie-up ) over and over again . Because of the peculiarity of the threading mentioned before , there can be no true tabby ( treadles 3 and 4 ) because , wherever there is a threading on harness 3 followed by a threading on harness 1 and one on harness 2 followed by a threading on harness 4 , there will occur a flat in the tabby sheds . This , however , can not be avoided . All tartans are woven in 2 ? 2 twill . The beautiful effects are pro-duced by a regular sequence of color stripes both in the warp and in the weft . When weaving twills do not be disturbed by the fact that the out-side warp end is not being caught by the weft , for this is charac-teristic of the weave . If the fabric is woven so that the wales con-tinue to slant in one direction for the entire length of the piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs free , but if the wales are reversed , by reversing the order of tromping the treadles , at that point the edge will be caught . This unwoven outside warp end can be overcome by using two shuttles each carrying the same weft . With the first shuttle weave one row from right to left , change the shed and weave the next row from right to left with the second shuttle . Continue to alternate shuttles . To weave a twill with one shuttle so that a warp end hangs free is , however , a good check on your tromping , for , if a treadle is skipped , you will know it instantly by the fact that the outside sel-vage thread is caught by the weft . Chapter 12 THE OVERSHOT WEAVE The overshot weave has been in use for centuries and is as popular today as ever . Most of the old coverlets woven with four harnesses were done on drafts of overshot . Their very names are intriguing : Whig Rose and Lover 's Knot , Chariot Wheels or Church Windows , Windflower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea and Federal Knot . We wonder what weavers named them long ago ! From diaries and old letters we know that , just as recipes are exchanged today , the old coverlet drafts went from hand to hand . Smaller patterns are just as numerous with Honeysuckle , Rose Path , and Monk 's Belt leading the long list . The overshot weave is so called because of the " overshots " called floats made by the colored pattern weft where it skips over certain portions of the warp . These floats contribute beauty and color to the weave but are its greatest weakness . Many times an old piece of weaving will remain intact except for the places where the floats of color have been worn away . These skips of weft over warp catch on dothing , too , so it is not practical to have long floats occur in a draft . Not many overshot drafts are written for more than four , harnesses as it is typically a four-harness weave . Today we are quite likely to use any weft we choose but most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of linen , 120 // for not until about 1830 was machinery introduced for spinning cotton warp . HOW TO TROMP AN OVERSHOT On a four-harness loom the combinations used for tromping an overshot pattern are made up of two harnesses used together , as fol lows : ( but not necessarily in this order ) 1 &; 2 ; 2 &; 3 ; 3 &; 4 ; and 1 &; 4 , corresponding to treadles 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 of the Worst tie-up , page 78 . Tabby or plain weave is woven by tromping harnesses 1 &; 3 together for one tabby shot and 2 &; 4 together for the other ( treadles 8 and 4 alternately ) . If you are not already familiar with the method of weaving with two shuttles , see page 95 . The draft given below is for the Honeysuckle pattern . It can be tromped in so many ways that one might say the possibilities are endless . There are 26 warp ends in each repeat of the draft as fol lows : Examining this draft , note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 or a 2 next to a 4 . These are tabby combinations and are seldom written in a draft for the overshot weave . But if you pick out the alternate warp ends in the draft ? there they are ! Therefore , by tromping the odd-numbered warp ends together by the use of treadle 3 you have one tabby shed while the even-numbered ends ( treadle 4 ) give you the other . The other combinations are reserved for the pattern shots . If you are using Mr. Worst 's book , Foot-Power Loom Weaving , however , you will find in it some drafts for the overshot weave in which the tabby treadles are to be tied to harnesses 1 &; 2 and 3 &; 4 , so that the usual tabby combinations of 1 &; 3 , and 2 &; 4 do occur // in these drafts as pattern shots . This will not disturb the experienced weaver , but the beginner will need to pay strict attention to the instructions given with these drafts in order to , treadle them correctly . If you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , it does not really matter except in the case of the coverlets , and a few other drafts which are tromped in a traditional way . But , for most drafts , it is fun to make up your own tromping , writing down the treadle numbers you use as you go along so that the pleasing ones may be repeated . Remember , overshot drafts are usually woven with two shuttles , one with tabby weft , the other carrying a coarser pattern weft , in color , as a general rule . Many overshot drafts are prettiest when woven " as drawn in , " or as expressed in the speech of the Southern Appalachian Highlands , when they are " tromped as writ . " This simply means that the harness combinations found in the written draft are taken for the tromping of it . Let us encircle the harness combinations in the Honeysuckle draft because from this you can get the tromping for Honeysuckle " woven as drawn in . " You will not need to encircle the selvage . Beginning at the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then comes 2 &; 3 ( the 2 is common to both ) followed by 3 &; 4 , and the next one is 1 &; 4 . The next is a 1 &; 2 , and in it there are four warp ends so they are encircled as are the four warp ends on the 2 &; 3 coming next . The largest combination in this pattern draft is the 3 &; 4 which comes next , for in it there are 7 warp ends . ( That is , at that point , when the draft was threaded through the heddles , seven warp ends were divided between these two harnesses. ) // This is the center of the pattern and you can readily see that from here on the draft reverses . Instead of saying " combinations " in the previous paragraphs , we could have said " blocks " and meant the same thing . The blocks in this weave form the floats , for when they are woven the color weft skips over the warp . The size of the float , therefore , depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block and also how coarse or fine a reed you are using . For example if the Honeysuckle draft after being threaded were sleyed one to a dent in a reed with only ten dents per inch , it can readily be seen that this large 3-4 block would be 7/10 of an inch long ? too long to be practical . But now let us return to the question of finding out how to weave this draft " tromped as writ . " The first block encircled on the right has only two figures ( cor responding to warp ends ) in it . The next three blocks also have two in each . But the fifth block written on 1 and 2 has four warp ends in it : 1,2,1,2 . When you tromp as writ , the general rule to follow is : Repeat the tromping for one less time than the number of warp ends in the block in question . Therefore , here is the tromping : ( Use a tabby before and after each pattern shot . ) There is no law that says you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you do not like it , change it to suit yourself . We have already noted on page 122 that certain figures in the draft were common to two successive tromping ( that is , harness ) com binations . You will notice that in the tromping directions given before for Honeysuckle there is also one figure common to two // successive pattern trompings , for instance , harnesses 1 &; 2 ; followed by 2 &; 3 , etc . This holds true for any overshot pattern unless it is woven on opposites . See below . The tromping which we worked out is only one of many which are possible for Honeysuckle . To find others , play around with the treadles to discover what combinations are pleasing to you . One way to find variations is by the use of a lady 's pocket mirror . Place the mirror on edge next to the last row of weaving and you will see in it how the design would appear if the tromping were to be reversed at that point . When you reverse a tromping direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern shot you used for the reversal point so that the same tabby shed is coupled with the same pattern shot for the entire tromping . Remember , too , that there are fourteen tromping combinations possible with a fourharness loom for , in addition to those of the regular tie-up , it is possible to change the tie-up so that each harness is used alone or so that three harnesses are used together . With these irregular tie-ups , however , the counterbalanced loom is at a disadvantage . Refer to page 143 . Many of the old colonial designs , especially those for coverlets , were woven so that each block which occurred on the diagonal of the design became a square , hence the term square the diagonal . If this is done , the remainder of the design will take care of itself . This is especially true of the circular patterns , whose blocks vary in size , but all those occurring on the diagonal are woven until they are square . To find the blocks on the diagonal , encircle the corn- i binations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness combinations just the same as before . When determining the number of times to repeat each combination , however , watch the material you are weaving to see that the blocks on the diagonal of the design are made square . The number of repeats of each harness combination to make naturally depends upon the type of weft you are using , how closely the warp is sleyed , and how hard you are beating . Any overshot draft may also be woven " on opposites , " if desired . // Some , indeed , are seldom if ever woven in any other way . Monk 's Belt is a typical example . When threading this draft , after the last pattern repeat has been threaded , end with the first ten warp ends . To weave this draft usually the only harness combinations em-ployed are those of the 1 &; 2 and 3 &; 4 harnesses ( treadles 1 and 5 ) . These are " opposite " combinations for 1 &; 2 are the two front harnesses while 3 &; 4 are the two towards the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two middle harnesses , 2 &; 3 , and the two outer ones , 1 &; 4 i.e. , treadles 2 and 6 , page 78 ) , are not used at all in Monk 's Belt as a general rule . The following are two variations for Monk 's Belt borders . Use a tabby before and after the pattern shots . Monk 's Belt may be woven in two colors . Use one for shots on treadle 1 and the other for those on treadle 5 ? three shuttles in all . The effect given by weaving on opposites is severe and clean-cut . In the background of the woven material , there is found none of the small flecks of color which occur when a draft is tromped in the usual manner . Notice that opposite harness combinations do not have a number in common . The tromping of harnesses 1 &; 2 together is followed // by 3 &; 4 together but never by 2 &; 3 or 1 &; 4 . If , for instance , the combination 1 &; 4 ( Tr. 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 &; 3 ( treadle 2 ) and not by any of the others . This , then , is what is meant by " weaving on opposites . " Try it on any overshot pattern . Sometimes technical discussions for a draft woven on opposites make mention of " accidentals . " This is a term used to refer to the harness combinations which , while written in the draft , are not as a rule tromped . For instance , in the Monk 's Belt draft , the combinations of 2 &; 3 and 1 &; 4 can be seen if you encircle the draft as was done with Honeysuckle on page 122 . These warp ends must be threaded through the heddles but when it comes to tromping the pattern , they are not ordinarily used . If they were omitted from the threading , however , you would have a 1 &; 3 and a 2 &; 4 combination appearing in the draft . Then , when tabby was tromped , two warp ends in adjacent heddles would find themselves either on the top or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in weaving called a " flat . " ( See page 83 . ) So , while accidentals must be threaded , they are not tromped if the pattern is woven on opposites . Bound weaving is also an interesting method to try . For this you will need four shuttles , each one carrying a different harmonizing color , or you may like to use four shades of one color . The wefts should all be the same grist . Use no tabby . Tromp the treadles 1.2.5 and 6 over and over again , a different shuttle being thrown with each treadle . Start all four shuttles from the right and as each one is used lay it in front of you , one under the other , so that they are all kept in order ready for use again . The wefts are carried up the selvages . Keep a strong tension on the warp when weaving in this manner . If at any time you wish to move the color of a stripe to another position , change the order of the shuttles but keep the tromping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weft-faced , the warp except at hem or fringe , will be entirely covered on both sides of the material . For this reason , the warp must be sleyed fairly // far apart and the wefts must be such that they will slip down along the warp ends and cover them . Carpet warp , one to a dent in a 15-dent reed , used with #3 pearl cotton for the wefts , is quite satisfactory . I have also seen this method used for material for purses on the Rose Path draft using 20/2 cotton warp yarn . The warp was threaded two ends through each heddle and two in a dent of a 12-dent reed . The weft used was a fine worsted yarn , and the warp did not show . Bound weaving requires time and patience , because there are many , many rows of weaving in each inch of material . But it is rewarding . This type of material shrinks when off the loom both in length and width and this fact must be taken into consideration when planning the warp . Interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the colors are rotated . The next method of weaving an overshot I shall designate as " Honeycomb weaving , " in spite of the fact that I know that some weavers contend it is not true honeycomb . It is a type of weaving in which one may say that there is a third dimension , for it is characterized by horizontal rows of sunken spots separated by two wavy , heavy , tabby shots . On the right side of the web there are a few short skips in the warp and on the wrong side there appear long , unsightly weft skips producing a decidedly one-sided material . Monk 's Belt and Honeysuckle can both be woven this way as can , in fact , any overshot pattern where the blocks are fairly large and drafted neither too close nor too far apart . WEAVING DIRECTIONS FOR A HONEYCOMB Counterbalanced loom . First choose your wefts . Contrary to the usual practice , the tabby thread must be heavier than the pattern weft . Carpet warp for the tabby in white or natural with a colored weft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use on a fine ( 20/2 ) cotton warp . After the hem is woven , weave as follows : ( The Worst tie-up will have to be changed to the direct tie-up given in Chapter 7 . Tabby is woven by using two treadles together : 1 &; 3 ; 2 &; 4 . ) Directions are for the counterbalanced loom . Keep // the tension of the warp as soft as compatible with a good shed and beat the tabby shots hard . If you are weaving this on the Monk 's Belt threading , perhaps you will not care for the effect given by Blocks C and D. The other two blocks are the ones usually used with this draft . Honeycomb weaving shrinks greatly both in width and length when off the loom and after it is laundered . The shrinkage in length is almost 20% . For a loom with rising shed , which is better for this irregular tie-up , substitute as follows : Any overshot pattern may also be woven in what is known as " the Italian manner " and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see page 152 ) . Three shuttles are needed for Italian weaving , each one using a different color but usually the same grist of weft . One of the , shuttles carries the dominant color ; the other two are backgrounds . // The two background colors " may be strongly contrasted in shade but should not be too far apart in value , and should be a good deal lighter than the pattern color . " * My artistic friends tell me that examples of such colors would be : gray and pale yellow ; purple and yellow ; red-violet and blue-violet with yellow-green for the main color ; pale olive green and cold gray and with this a vermilion for the dominant color . We shall designate these shuttles as P , B1 and B2 . The effect gained is somewhat similar to the flame or Bargello type of em-broidery . Draw a circle on a piece of paper and on its circumference mark the four usual pattern harness combinations as follows : Place this where you can see it as you weave . Now refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will weave this pattern in the Ital ian manner . The first instruction call for harnesses 1 &; 2 ( treadle 1 ) - once Proceed as follows : Weave harnesses 1 &; 2 ( together once with P. Then look along the circumference of your circle to the next combination there , 2 &; 3 , and weave it once with B1 . Look back again to the original 1 Sc 2 combination and weave it once with P. Then trace to the left from 1 &; 2 at the top of the circle to find 1 &; 4 which is your next tromping for which you are to use B2 . Then come back to the top of the circle to 1 &; 2 and weave it again with P. These five combinations used in this order constitute the first tromping direction of the original Honeysuckle : 1 Sc 2-once . Start all three shuttles from the right and after use lay them down in front of you in order , ready to be used again . Here , then , are the tromping equivalents of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :
