When Chicago Tribune Publisher Robert R. McCormick died last spring , newsmen all over the U.S. wondered what changes would come in the paper without the Colonel 's commanding , eccentric personality to steer it . Would the Trib , for example , drop some of his pet projects and peeves ? Last week , amidst a number of almost imperceptible changes , the Trib stepped right out and put the ax to one of the Colonel 's fondest innovations . <P> For the first time since the day in 1934 when McCormick ordered radical new simplified spelling , the Trib was going back to some old spelling rules . Instead of such words as frate , grafic , tarif , soder and sofisticated , the Trib will now use freight , graphic , tarif , solder and sophisticated , just like everybody else . Still unchanged are the Colonel 's spellings of such words as thoro , burocratic and altho . <P> While he was alive , the Colonel stuck to his simplified spelling with a vengeance .

" <P> Although the Trib still hews to its maverick politics , blasting both the Democrats and the Republicans and taking off after many of its old whipping boys , its running battle with the 20th century in general has started to subside . There is also more humor and less soapboxing on the editorial page . Says Managing Editor Don Maxwell , editorial boss of the triumvirate that now runs the paper ( TIME , April 18 ) , " I always hate to do anything that changes a policy of the Colonel 's , but I have to make up my own mind now .

While most newsmen applauded the efforts of the new Trib 's bosses to strike out on their own , the applause was tempered by some regret . Said one Chicago newsman : " There is something sad about seeing the Trib lose the old to-hell-with-everything air of individualism that the Colonel instilled. "
