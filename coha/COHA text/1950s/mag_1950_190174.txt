In Asia , as elsewhere , Communism grows through force and deceit . In IndoChina-where Communist Ho Chi Minh 's Viet Minh party is carrying on a stubborn guerrilla war against the French-TIME Correspondent Andre Laguerre found people who understood Communism better than many a " sophisticated " Westerner . Laguerre 's report : <P> <P> IN the primitive , rice-growing villages of the Red River delta , I found a slow building-up of effective antiCommunism . Bai Trang ( pop . 2,000 ) is one such-a village with no illusions . <P> Its approaches are deceptively peaceful . Water buffaloes patiently drag plows through the flooded rice fields ; wiry little peasant women in circular straw hats , chocolate-colored jackets and black trousers pitpat swiftly along the roads in bare feet , carrying produce to market in baskets balanced on poles over their shoulders . As my jeep left the road and followed the twisting , hedged lane that led to Bai Trang , war - or preparations for war-sprang to view . A rough stone wall protected the village . It bore the crudely painted inscription : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nha " ( Down with the men who make the misery of the people , who destroy the temples ) . <P> First &; Third Degree . Along the wall a guard of honor was drawn up-a dozen boys and young men in rumpled Stetsons . The smallest , aged 14 , whose head barely reached above my thigh , beat a drum ; the tallest , who came up to my chin , proudly carried an old but carefully polished rifle . This was a detachment of Bai Trang 's Anti-Communist Youth and Children 's Leagues . <P> The village elders , dressed in black gowns over white robes , advanced in greeting , preceded by the ly-truong , or village chief . We sat around a rectangular table and drank hot tea and tepid beer . A sharp-nosed , black-eyed young man called Nguyen Van Tin explained about the Anti-Communist Youth League , which he had founded last fall . <P> " I used to be in the Viet Minh myself , " he said , " before it was an exclusively Communist movement . I was only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . All Viet Minh followers are classified by them in one of three degrees . Those in the first degree are taught no Communism ; they are sincere nationalists who would be angry if they knew the truth . Those in the second degree are considered promising enough to be given general Communist indoctrination . Those in the third degree learn that world revolution under the total leadership of Russia is their goal . <P> " But I got books and studied , and soon I understood that Communism was the mortal enemy of our society , which is based first on the family community and then on the village community . I decided that Communism is a terrible thing to fight if you do n't know what you want . But if you organize against Communism , it is easy to beat , because it can not live beside truth in the hearts of the people . <P> " This is what I teach the members of our league .
