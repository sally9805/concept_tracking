Fiscal Parley Held Here By PAUL CROWELL Governor Dewey flatly rejected yesterday the City Council 's request that he call a special summer session of the Legislature to consider more financial aid for the city . In a statement made public at Albany , " Mr. Dewey declared that " calling a special session of the Legislature to consider ' get-richquick ' schemes is not a sound substitute for sound fiscal planning and a carefully thought out program . " The statement was Mr. Dewey 's reply to a resolution adopted last Tuesday by the City Council . The resolution asked for the special session and requested additional state aid , legalization of off-thetrack betting on horse races , and restoration of the 4 per cent city tax on pari-mutuel racing pools to its former 5 per cent level . Governor Dewey 's statement , released by his counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised to submit to the 1953 Legislature a broad program for stabilizing the city 's finances . It noted also that Lieut . Gov . Frank C. Moore , State Controller J. Raymond and other state officials were cooperating with the Mayor and his fiscal aides in working out such a program . He Will Await Outcome " They are extending every possible assistance and cooperation to the city officials in this task , " Mr. Dewey declared . " The responsible city officials are trying to work out fundamental fiscal planning policies . " As Governor , I will await the outcome of these studies , which are to be submitted to the 1953 session . " The City Council 's resolution of last Tuesday was similar to one adopted on May 6 . It asked Governor Dewey for " the courtesy of a reply " either granting the re quests or giving reasons for denial . In his reply denying the request for a special legislative session , , Mr. Dewey said : " The proposals which the City Council now makes were considered at the 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No purpose would be served by calling a special session to consider them a third time . " Mr. Shapiro said Mr. Dewey 's // Office had received no word from the Mayor concerning the City Council 's action , but declined comment when asked whether it was believed at Albany that the Mayor had given it his sanction . In New York , however , it was Understood the Council definitely had acted on its own , and that the Mayor was sticking closely to the agreement made with Governor Dewey and his fiscal staff when the 1952 Legislature enacted its program of " stop-gap " financial ' aid to the city . The program consisted largely of the granting of power to levy new nuisances taxes , increase old ones , finance transit deficits with serial bonds and defer payment of certain obligations due in 1952-53 . While the Dewey statement was being made public in Albany , a group of state and city officials were holding a day-long session in the office of Budget Director Abraham D. Beane in an effort to achieve progress on the long-range fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January . According to Mr. Beanie , one of the serious problems considered by the group was that of finding , for the benefit of the city 's 1953-54 budget , $46,500,000 to replace an equal amount of nonrecurrent 1952-53 revenue . Mr. Beame explained that $30.000,000 of sales tax revenue in 1952-53 , made possible by a shift of collection dates , would not be available in 1953-54 ; that only $8,000,000 of auto-use tax money and $3,500,000 of liquor license fee income would be available in 1953-54 , instead of the $16 , - 000,000 and $7,000,000 , respectively , available in 1952-53 . Another nonrecurrent item will be $5,000 , - 000 to be received in 1952-53 , but not in 1953-54 , from the New York City Housing Authority in lieu of taxes . The city-state group discussed also the city 's probable total budget needs for 1953-54 , but no estimate was made available . In some quarters , however , it has I been estimated that the city 's 1953-54 budget will call for appropriations exceeding by at least 1100,000,0o0 the record 1952-53 budget of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Beame , were William F.
