Patients , Not Textbooks Students used to spend two years in medical school before they ever saw a patient . They learned about bones from a skeleton and from charts , and often had a hard time when it came to setting a fracture . U.S. medical schools have been gradually shifting the emphasis from textbooks to patients . At the nation 's newest medical school , at the University of California at Los Angeles , which opened its doors this week , first-year men will begin learning from patients in their first week . <P> Each student will be assigned ( under the eye of a graduate pediatrician ) to watch the growth of a young baby . He will get to know his " patient " in sickness &; in health . In emergencies he must get up at 3 a.m. , if necessary , to be on the spot as soon as the pediatrician . <P> The " Whole " Subject . U.C.L.A. 's medical school consists , so far , of 28 students , 25 teachers and temporary quarters in remodeled buildings . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 million plant housing the school and its hospital . The man behind the plans for a modern medical school at U.C.L.A. is 55-year-old Dean Stafford Leak Warren , who went to U.C.L.A. in 1947 from the University of Rochester , after serving as medical director of the Manhattan Project and consultant to the AEC . <P> Warren had definite ideas about the proper way to lay out medical buildings , and he drew the first rough sketches for U.C.L.A. 's . Example : operating rooms used to be on the top floor , to catch all possible daylight ; since modern lighting now makes this unnecessary , Warren placed his operating rooms on the ground floor , easy to reach from an ambulance . But his fundamental idea is to teach medicine as a " whole " subject , not just a series of loosely connected courses in anatomy , pharmacology and biochemistry . <P> The Smell of Acetone . Dean Warren does not claim that his philosophy of medical education is original , only that he has a grand chance to build it into the foundations of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " our anatomy student is also taught physical diagnosis . A patient is brought in , say an orthopedic case-a , dislocation of the shoulder . The anatomy professor is taking up the shoulder girdle . The radiologist brings the films down , showing normal shoulder girdles , abnormal ones , displacements and fractures . <P> " The student learns a little about the interpretation of X-ray films . He visualizes the anatomy much more clearly . The orthopedist describes the case , how the accident developed , what the symptoms are . He shows the patient , actually reduces the dislocation if possible . As he puts on the bandages or plaster , he has the help of the first-year students . <P> " The same thing ought to happen all the way through what are called the preclinical sciences . During biochemistry , for instance , the diabetic case ought to be brought down to the laboratory as the students are studying the blood-sugar problem . The students ought to smell the acetone on his breath . They ought to see him as a patient , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In short , as Dean Warren never tires of saying : " The doctor exists for the patient . "
