South Bend , Ind . last week was in the throes of one of the worst winters in its history , yet hardly anyone talked about the weather . " With all these Larks around , " said Studebaker-Packard 's President Harold E. Churchill , " it 's been like spring . " Production of the Lark was up to 4,300 cars a week ; total production for 1959 so far ( 61,000 ) was 12,000 ahead of the entire 1958 model year . <P> Some Said Die . South Bend , as well as Studebaker , has made a comeback with the Lark . Through most of 1958 , the city and surrounding St. Joseph County constituted a " critical " unemployment area . As sales and production grew steadily smaller , the layoffs mounted , until by March barely 4,700 workers had jobs at the plant . Along with recession slowdowns at other big companies-Bendix Products Division , U.S. Rubber , Curtiss-Wright-the cutbacks pushed total county unemployment to a record 15,900-more than 16% of the labor force . Lines started forming on Lafayette Street for handouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point the city 's Council of Community Services reported 3,788 hardship cases per month , and people could be heard wishing that Studebaker would go under once and for all . Says a Chamber of Commerce official : " A minority wanted Studebaker to die , so we could take a fresh look at our future . But most people thought if we lose Studey , South Bend will be in real trouble . " <P> That Studey did not die is due to a hard battle , well fought by both company and community . Almost from the moment he took over in mid-1956 , President Churchill , who made his mark as Studebaker 's top research engineer , realized that the company 's salvation lay in scrapping its big-car line for a single , easy-to-build , low-priced small car that did not have to compete on the Big Three 's terms . In January 1958 , Churchill gathered his top executives and put the question to them ; at the end of the less than two hour meeting , the decision was made . <P> From then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in the same room with his development team , consisting of five designers and 16 engineers . The trick was to do the job on a shoestring . The team found a way to revamp the dies from last year 's models , use them to stamp the new car 's sheet metal ; all parts were bolted together instead of expensively welded ; front and rear bumpers were made identical ; the front sheet metal assembly was reduced to six pieces . In seven months the Lark was ready . Total development cost : less than $3,000,000 , v. an estimated $150 million for the 1959 Ford . <P> Most Said Buy . Even before word got around of S.-P. ' s gamble to survive , South Bend had decided to do what it could to help the company . A group started a " Citizens for Studebaker " committee , toured the area soliciting pledges to buy a new 1959 Studebaker , issued 60,000 stickers and 10,000 buttons promoting the Lark , wrote ' letters , gave speeches , finally staged a huge parade depicting the company history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . The county A.F.L.-C.I.O. council mailed 14,000 letters across the U.S. pushing the Lark . Along South Bend streets , every third street lamp was plastered with : <P> <P> SOUTH BEND GOES UP WITH THE LARK . <P>
