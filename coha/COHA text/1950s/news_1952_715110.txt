txt Mayor Impellitteri named yesterday a three-man committee to " inquire broadly " into the gathering crisis on eight local private bus lines . But having done that , the Mayor , who departs today for a FloeIda vacation , speedily made clear that the committee would have no power to mediate the dispute between the companies and Michael J. Quill 's Transport Workers Union , C. I. 0. , over institution ofi the forty-hour week on Jan. 1 . The companies have said they would need a fifteen-cent fare to finance the demand . The union has threatened a strike to win its objective at the expiration of the present contract on Dec. 31 . As a further pressure move Mr. Quill proclaimed on Tuesday in Philadelphia , where his union is in convention , that beginning at midnight Sunday bus drivers would stop collecting fares from 3,500 , - 000 daily riders of the private lines . In Philadelphia yesterday the T. W. U. convention adopted a res. olution directing New York bus drivers to cease collecting fares at midnight Sunday , and Ellis Van Riper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go into hiding with the local 's $500,000 treasury in case the companies brought suit . Function Somewhat in Doubt In view of the Mayor 's specific limitation on the powers of his committee the question of the group 's function was left somewhat in doubt , particularly since for several months now Mr. Irnpellitteri has had , a Transit Advisory Commission looking into the matter of private line finances and the forty-hour week . Apparently the first task of the committee will be to get Mr. Quill to withdraw his threat to collect no fares . For that purpose the group seemed well-constituted . Its members are Joseph E. O'Grady , partner in the law firm of Goldwater &; Flynn and former director of the city 's Division of Labor Relations ; Victor S. Riesenfeld , civic and philanthropic leader , and Joseph Curran , president of the National Maritime Union , C. L 0 . But John E. McCarthy , the president of the New York City Omnibus Corporation and the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , was not waiting for the committee to act . Instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impartial chairman of the private transit industry , whose job it is to see that the companies and the union live up to their contract . " We demand , " said Mr. McCarthy , " that you immediately issue an order directing the union to conform to the provisions of the contract , which requires , among other things , that there shall be no interference or interruption in the normal operation of the companies until Dec. 31 . " Kheel ' Considering ' Demand Mr. Kheel reported receipt of the telegram and said he was " considering it . " The chances appeared to be that if the Mayor 's committee did not ease the way for a withdrawal of the Quill threat , Mr. Kheel would forbid the union to go through with its plan for fare-less transportation . The second and major task of the Mayor 's committee will be to get the companies and union into active collective bargaining and to devise a formula for achieving the forty-hour week without bankrupting the companies and without ' raising the new hourly rate for the shorter week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cut on the private lines the take-home pay of 8,000 workers must remain the same . Translated into figures this means that the hourly rate would have to increase enough so that when it is multiplied by forty it would equal the present wage for forty-eightl hours . In the case of the Third Avenue Transit Corporation , for example , where the present hourly rate for a forty-eight-hour schedule is $1.66 , the rate for the forty-hourweek would be $1.99 . This arithmetic worries the companies , but it also worries the city , which has its own transit system and 40,000 employes to think about . The present hourly rate for bus drivers employed by the city is $1.86 for a forty-hour week . In the back of the minds of city officiald is the realization that if the IT . W. U. wills the forty-hour week ( with no loss in take-home pay and jacking up the hourly rate on the ( private lines to the neighborhood of $2 , the city can look for a similar wage demand when its contract with the union expires on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the technique of " leapfrogging " wages to great'advantage . Under the circumstances , it is to be expected that he would attempt the strategy once again , given the opportunity . Ordinarily the city figures that . every one-cent increase in hourly costs adds Up , tcA $1,000,000 . To level off the ' galkiiietween the city 's rate of $1,86 and a $2 rate on private lines would cost $14,000 , - 000 . The Board of Transportation figures its deficit for the fiscal year ending next June 30 at about $47,000,000 . The Mayor has gone on record as opposing any increase in the present dime fare as a means of solving the problems of the private lines . His Transit Advisory Commission , composed of Mr. Kornblum , Edward C. Maguire , Commissioner of the Board of Water Supply , and Corporation Counsel Denis M. Hurley , has been studying the financial question and is expected soon to report to the Beard of Estimate . The private lines include New York City Omnibus , Fifth Avenue Coach . Third Avenue Transit , Queens-Nassau , Triboro Coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and East Broadway . A ninth company , the Queensborough Bridge Railway Company , has been absorbed by Queens-Nassau.
