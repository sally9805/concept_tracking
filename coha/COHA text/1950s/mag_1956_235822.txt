Outside the mining town of Beckley , W. Va . one afternoon last week , the deep-throated voice of John L. Lewis rumbled over the heads of 5,000 listeners and bounced sonorously back from the green mountainsides . In a chill drizzle , the United Mine Workers ' boss warmly hailed a " new era of peace " that had brought forth one of the most impressive social landmarks in U.S. industry : a chain of ten hospitals in three states , built and operated by the U.M.W. 's welfare and retirement fund . As Lewis dedicated the chain to " those who suffered and died before us , " patients and doctors watched intently from the northernmost hospital of the $26 million network , a five-story , glass-walled building so bright and strange to the Appalachian valley that miners call it " Beckley 's Airport . " <P> Medically and architecturally , the U.M.W. hospitals in West Virginia , Virginia , and Kentucky are among the most advanced to be found anywhere in the U.S. Built for the low cost of $16,000 per bed , the hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each " chain-store " hospital is laid out around a central service core , from which food and drugs move by assembly belt and dumb-waiter to dispatch stations on every floor . A centralized administration and service center at Williamson , W. Va . will keep the books and do the housekeeping , e.g. , maintenance , filling of prescriptions , laundry , for the whole system . Thus the cost of administering the medical program has been cut to 5.4% of the $42.8 million total spent in fiscal 1955 , well under half the 12.6% average administrative cost for U.S. group hospital and medical plans . <P> Though the U.M.W. welfare and pension fund was set up ten years ago and has cost the industry close to $1 billion , a series of strikes and squabbles delayed its effective operation until 1950 . Since 1946 , the mine operators have upped their contribution from 5 to 40 a ton . They have also accepted responsibility for the monumental task of bringing modern medicine to the industry with the second-highest accident rate ( after logging ) in the U.S. Unlike many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Senate subcommittee investigating union welfare funds last April called it " honestly and well administered ... no less than excellent . " <P> Moreover , as old ( 76 ) John L. pointed out last week , pensions and medical care for the U.M.W. 's 400,000 miners and their families in the area have left " men on both sides of the industry . . . free to apply themselves to the major project of making this industry successful . " The U.S. today produces more coal at lower cost than any other nation in the world . With production running 15% ahead of 1955 and heavy export orders stacked up , the once-sick industry is fast improving its health .
