During the Korean war , U.S. money ( in the form of war orders , servicemen 's pay , etc. ) poured into Japan at the rate of $800 million to $900 million a year . On a nation struggling up from the ashes of defeat and destruction in World War II . the effect was something like that of a lottery windfall on a poor and unstable clerk . It was fine , it was riotous , while it lasted ; it was terrible when it stopped . The Japanese spent too much for luxuries , not enough on modernizing their industry and otherwise bracing their economy against the inevitable end of the Korean boom . <P> <P> Now Japan , a sovereign nation , is poor , almost broke , worried , and professedly ready to reform . Her usable foreign exchange stands at $640 million , down from $800 million last December . Economists say that the " peril point " is $500 million . Below that figure , the effect will be like that of failure rumors on an uninsured bank . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have caused Japan to spend too much for imports , much more than her high-priced exports can balance . ( A Japanese refrigerator sells for around $500 . ) But not all of her troubles are the fruits of postwar folly . Before she lost her empire in the war , she got rice from Korea , wheat from Manchuria . Now she must import $400 million in food annually to feed her people . Her own rice crop last year was the poorest in 60 years . She has no coking coal of her own ; her prewar source of supply , the Chinese mainland , is now shut off . So she imports this coal from the U.S. and elsewhere , at $11 to $17 a ton . She has similar trouble with salt , a staple of her chemical industry , on which the shipping costs alone are $12 a ton . Some of her prewar export markets are closed to her by the Bamboo Curtain , others by old hatreds , others by stiff free-world competition . Japanese silk , which used to be her biggest dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> After getting repeated bulletins on Japan 's worsening plight , the Eisenhower Administration decided to step in . Last week four departments-State , Defense , Treasury and Commerce-and two agencies-the Foreign Operations Administration and the President 's Council of Economic Advisers-were set to looking for solutions . Present diagnosis : Japan is in no danger of imminent economic collapse , but collapse will surely come if the present trend goes on . <P> Premier Shigeru Yoshida 's government , of course , would like to have a large loan to tide it over , but Washington feels that pouring in money will induce another period of Japanese inertia . Washington favors more belt-tightening , more austerity , and possibly devaluation . Japanese businessmen are screaming that the amount of austerity already decreed and enforced by Yoshida is producing deflation and unemployment .
