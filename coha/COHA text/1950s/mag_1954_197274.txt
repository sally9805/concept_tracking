Edinburgh 's famed International Festival of Music and Drama opened for its 21-day run last week with a schedule of no less than 170 events by eight orchestras seven choruses , six chamber orchestras ' and quartets , one ballet , one opera and five dramatic companies . First week 's highlight was the Sadler 's Wells Ballet production of Firebird , starring brilliant Ballerina Margot Fonteyn , who in the title role seemed as quick as an imp out ot hell , as fluttery as a butterfly . <P> In London Sadler 's Wells Theatre Ballet ( a kind of junior relative and farm club of the famed old company ) went on strike for higher pay , canceling the company 's two-week London run this month . Management came through with " merit raises " from $2.80 to $5.60 weekly , which puts the average corps member in a slightly better financial position than bus conductors and typists ( about $20 weekly ) but not quite up to the average of a West End chorine ( about $28 ) .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
