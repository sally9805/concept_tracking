ORDINARY PEOPLE who do n't know what public-relations experts actually do are not half-witted ; pub-lic-relations experts do n't exactly know either . At the tenth national conference of the Public Relations Society of America , held in Phila-delphia November 18 - 20 , everyDAVID CORT , author of The Big Picture , is a frequent contributor . body was looking for answers and the typical sentence ended with a question mark . Thus , one speaker ( The Texas Company ) : " Are we a beneficial force in modern society ? Are we cocky , presumptuous , smug ? Have we too much faith in the loftiness of our profession ? What do we mean by ' the engineering of consent ? ' Do we really create giants out of pygmies ? Are we just a fringe benefit for management ? Do we stand too low on the management totem-pole ? Why is our field more difficult to evaluate than any other ? " The speaker , scratching his nose helplessly between riddles , gave no real answers . The cumulative impression was that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent ) courageously demanded that Public Relations make up its mind whether it is a profession , a craft , an art ? or nothing , and suggested a vote on whether its practitioners should be licensed by government dike doctors , registered by a self-governing body like craftsmen , or let alone like artists . The vote broke into about equal thirds on the three choices . Such soul-searchings struck me as funny at first . And then I realized that they are not typically a symptom of hollow futility , but on the contrary the growing pains of a cause that senses its own real potential and wants to straighten out its soul while there is still time . Public Relations was , before the Second World War , a small , pretentious phenomenon all but localized in Manhattan and Washington , D. C. It has become the great international monster , PR ( an ellipsis that seemed to offend the conference members ) , only in the last ten years . I suspect it of growing out of the spirit of the American war effort and postwar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of PR is still unofficial ; it is still not listed as a separate activity by , the Census Bureau , but lumped along with telephone-answering services , armored cars , nurses , collection agencies , artists and writers as " miscellaneous business services . " The estimate of a conference speaker was that there are now 100,000 Americans engaged in PR , and that they spend about two billion dollars a year . The great majority are in the PR departments of corporations , government agencies , the armed services , universities , foundations , etc They are recruited from the press and entertainment business , from government , from business and straight from the business schools ; and most , of them have to make up their rules as they go along . Mostly they work in isolation , heard but not seen . And here at the ' Hotel Sheraton in Philadelphia , I found myself in the midst of a flock of a thousand of them , like a naturalist who wakes from a ' nap on the prairie and finds himself surrounded by whooping cranes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of Madiscin Avenue grandee , the overpowering personality seeking whom he could devour . December 7 , 1957 Nothing like that was visible . These were unpretentious , friendly , unspectacular people , and spoke an English I understood . The word for them would be " square " ? meaning , for the benefit of future generations , simple , provincial and insensitive to the esoterica of the " hipsters , " those cultists of suffering , defeat or lunacy . They were not over-eager to introduce themselves , but happy when they felt it was all right . A suspicion was growing in me , and to confirm it , I repaired to the list of conference registrations . Of about 750 then listed , hardly 25 per cent were from the supposed capital of PR , New York City . Such supposed captains of the industry as Ben Sonnenberg and Earl Newsom were not listed at all , nor , so far as I saw , were any of their employees . There were solid blocks from Chicago , Los Angeles , Texas , St. Louis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no PR in Peoria ? Quite in line with this general character was the fact that the PR elder statesman present was Pendleton Dudley , a gentle old firebrand whose career was made when he let a married couple use his garage to start a new magazine that turned out to be Reader 's Digest . Though his PR firm is in New York , he is as kindly and " square " as a country parson . THE complete absence of the Madison Avenue tone , even the ignoring of the profit motive , the sense of a conceptual structure that everybody understood but nobody could de ' fine , all suggested something that I ' knew was familiar but that I could not isolate , perhaps because it was unexpected . The words were clear enough : " Statism will eventually take over . . . unless the Public Relations concept can be incorporated into the life-stream of business . . . . The effective Public Relations advisor to business must realize that he has chosen the path of personal obscurity . " At that point I almost had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not " a front for a kept group of well-paid hucksters . I have seen . . . it lead its clients ' corporate businesses out of the wilderness of vanity and arrogance What ? A Bol shevik ? 1-Tere ? into the meadow of humility and modesty . ... " The above simply can not be dismissed as hot air . It is talking about a real situation , with a mysterious plus . Read it over . At some point you will realize , more quickly than I did , that this is not business ; it is religion . The Bible says the same things a hundred or a thousand times , of course somewhat better . St. Paul speaks , to the Corinthians again ; the Old Testament is more abusive . WHAT IS THE real situation ? At its most acceptable level , it is clear in a comparison of the English Tory , who loves England , with the American Republican businessman who is drafted into government . The American is the more able in his business ; and an utter incompetent in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of Mellon ! ) ; now we have in the Department of Defense first General Motors , and now Procter &; Gamble . My fraternity magazine tells me that this latter comes out of promotion and advertising . If PR can give these fellows religion , it deserves ecclesiastical status at once . The speakers I heard were not generally willing to accept lip-service ; they demanded real conversions from management . I am not religious , and so I can ask whether the PR religion will be as useless to us as Christianity was to ancient Rome . Big business might wonder , too , whether the PR saints are to be the martyrs of the Colosseum , the converters of the barbarians , the witnesses of the Sack of Rome , the builders of the new chivalry , the monks who chided the knights and led them on new crusades . But since both business and PR are thinking only of this world , not the next , there is no real compulsion to repeat the old sad history of Rome , or of the Church Fathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were reminded of the hope of a better world , of the Communist devil , of the need for self-struggle and humility , ' the command to spread the Word at any cost , and the promise of nothing but pain , poverty , virtue and maybe glory . Any new " religion in industrial America must have university seminaries . The same speaker quoted above cited Stanford , Harvard , Texas and Maryland universities , and San Jose State College , for pioneering work in PR . Lovejoy 's College Guide gives a rather different list of institutions offering PR courses : Iowa , Ohio , Boston , Syracuse and American universities and , in New York City , New York University and The New School for Social Research . It may be that PR will still find its intellectual source in Manhattan , though not precisely along Madison Avenue . A sharp test of this supposed PR morality was provided me when , among a group of thirty simultaneous seminars , I noticed one entitled , " How to Handle the ! Bad ' Story . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private relations of individuals , are heavy with " bad stories . " All life is a " bad story " from which only philosophers can extract the ultimate " good story , " for indeed everybody is killed . This meeting would be the place to find out whether PR was anything more than a midnight burier of bodies , a plausible mortician wiping his hands with formaldehyde and pieties . That word " handle " bracketed with " bad " was enough to wake a witch . I woke . The group-leader ( Westinghouse ) impressed me at once by saying that he had recently had to handle three " bad stories . " The old-style , or Ben Sonnenberg , type of public-relations man could not have brought these words out of his mouth , but this man did it very easily , and the others shook their heads ruefully . They all had worse tales to tell than he . Oh , they respected his sack-cloth , but listen to this . . . . The normal procedure of these PR people , if one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the story to the press , document it , look for friendly spokesmen , try to inject some reasonable perspective and then sit back and take whatever came out in print . In cases where the reporter had seemed flagrantly unfair  --  and the examples given were reasonably plausible  --  the PR representative had made his protest directly to the reporter , not to his editor . There had been no policy of demanding retractions , withdrawing advertising , getting writers fired . Nearly all the PR people present confirmed the foolishness of getting mad at the press . Even the writer could not safely be attacked ; the columnist ( Pegler and Pearson were named in lowered voices ) was dynamite ; the editorial page was untouchable . There was full knowledge that editors bridle at interference , and can reopen a fight every day from ten ' different directions . Any attempt at suppression is the quick way to make headlines . The airlines have adopted the policy of getting a fatal crash story into all the papers quickly ; that way it 's out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be that a really bad story , like a case of industrial irradiation , the drowning of small boys in an excavation pool or , the recent classic , the linking of General Electric with the call-girl madame , Nella Bogart , has to be allowed to run its course . For what it is worth , nearly everyone had a grievance against Time magazine ; the only other offenders were , of all things , the Wall Street Journal , and a scheduled story in Woman 's Day . A few voices spoke up , on the other hand , for suppression of news . As it happened , these were in every case ex-newspapermen . An oil company man who had blanketed news of ' a strike gave his opinion that it is easy to outwit , outpunch and outmaneuver the trade-union boys ( in his case , an independent union ) . With these exceptions , the sense of the meeting was impressively decent , considering that these people , ' the " squares " of the industry , were responsible to managements that would prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed is another matter . ?
