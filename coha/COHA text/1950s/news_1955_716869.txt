txt Mayor Paul Egan of Aurora said yesterday that he was " going to demand that Gov . Stratton send the militia into Aurora " as an aftermath of his fist fight in his office Wednesday with Justice of the Peace John Chivari . Egan said he has sent the governor a telegram and that he will go to Springfield if the goVernor does n't respond . Egan said he took the action because he claimed that after the fight , " somebody from the police department sneaked into my office and stole all the police and fire board records . " Egan said the records contained facts that were damaging to several high ranking police officials . Police broke up the fight after Chivari had knocked the mayor across a desk and the mayor whacked Chivari with a heavy pair of scissors , cutting gash in his forehead .
