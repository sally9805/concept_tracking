 | Not in that much of a rush , she told herself as she fastened her hair at the neck with a long silver arrow . Neither was Ken Stewart , apparently . Months ago she had written him she had been advised that an annulment of the marriage now would in no way threaten their inheritance , would he co-operate ? He not only would but with bells on , he had cabled . Go to it . He was n't even interested to see what the girl he had married was like . Not too bad , she decided as she critically inspected her reflection in the long mirror . The leaf-green cotton taffeta frock , with the soft yellow velvet ribbon belt into which she had tucked a few calendulas , brought out the sheen of her hair and the brown of her eyes , the golden tan of her skin . " He 'll never know what a charmer he lost , will he , gal ? " she queried aloud and wrinkled her nose in self-derision at the looking-glass girl . " Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her smile vanished . Hal was terribly likable , but he was making life difficult . He had waylaid her in the village this morning to tell her that he was planning a gala outdoor roast at his place , on the day her annulment was granted , to celebrate her freedom . Darn . Everyone in town had known of what they called " the proxy mar-riage , " now talk of the annulment was crowding the air waves . " I do n't want a celebration , " she protested under her breath as she went slowly down the stairs . " It 's a poisonous idea to make whoopee over a broken marriage , even if it 's only a written contract like mine . I wo n't stand for it . " Seth Armstrong rose and came forward with pudgy hand outstretched in greeting when she entered the patio . He was neither so short , bald nor stout as she had imagined him from  | Sary 's description . A little bouncy , but nice manners . A boutonniere of deep blue bachelor buttons adorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white trousers were immaculate and creased to perfection , his eyes were pale , but keen , his voice was a trifle unctuous , the waxen whiteness of his plump hands was accentuated by a huge sardonyx ring . The big seal on the bracelet man 's finger had seemed to belong ; for some remote reason that on Armstrong 's seemed out of character . Not especially attractive , but trustworthy , she decided . " At last we meet , Mrs. Stewart . It is a pleasure I have long anticipated . I have n't seen you since you were little Cindy Clinton . " Mrs. Stewart . It was a shock to hear the name again . Since her return to The Castle two months ago she had been Cindy Clinton to neighbors and friends . " Thank you , Mr. Armstrong . I am afraid I have given you a lot of trouble by asking you to come here , but I am eager to get this annulment business behind me . I hope you drink tea ? " She seated herself at the glass-top table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver and Lowestoft and the hot-water kettle spouting pearly steam . He drew n chair beside her . She wondered if his thoughts were as large and smooth as his white hands . " Certainly I drink tea . " He had a curious habit of inRating and deflating his cheeks before speaking . " My secretary serves it for me in my New York office each afternoon at four . Lovely place you have made of this spot between the two slanting ells . " Cindy 's eyes followed his as they traveled round the enclosure , open on the fourth side to a superb view of the ocean .  | A velvety lawn was broken in the center by a small pool carpeted by green pads and pink and white lilies between which flashed an occasional streak of gold . The spray from a small fountain shot up into the sunshine , glittered like yellow diamonds before it dropped back . Beyond that a putt% green extended almost to the shore . Against the gray stone walls of the house , perennials put on a flower show of gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollyhocks ; a bee reeled drunkenly from out the depths of a mammoth regal lily ; a great yellow moth fanned black-streaked wings on the tall , light-blue spike of a second-blossoming larkspur beside a rosy clump of phlox ; a cloud of small yellow butterflies hovered above the orange king and lemon queen calendulas . On a window ledge a cat , black as the wings of a dragonfly hovering above a clump of tawny zinnias below her , regarded with blank topaz eyes a robin cautiously bathing in the shallows of the pool . Green chintz on white wicker chairs matched the lawn in shade . A light salty breeze shook fragrance from the flowers and spicy scent from a windbreak of balsams . Cindy 's attention returned to the man beside her . " It is nice here . Sarah Ann Parker has been a wonderful housekeeper and friend . She kept up my garden while I was away . Is your tea the right strength ? " " Perfect . This toasted canape is tops . What 's the spread ? " " Mushrooms . Try one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write home about . I can say that as I did n't make them . " " No , thanks . I am reserving space for the brownies . I 'm a chocolate addict . " Gourmand , I 'll bet . He actually licked his chops when he looked at that plate , Cindy thought .  | They chatted about local matters till , after asking permission , he lighted a cigar . " Now , may we talk business ? " Cindy inquired eagerly . " I am anxious to hear a report of what you have accomplished . " " No more anxious than I am to get ahead with the matter . " He drew a sheaf of papers from an inside pocket of his gray coat . " At long last I have succeeded in getting an answer from your husband . " " My husband ! Glory be , I had almost forgotten I had one , I have n't , really . We 'll have the table cleared , you may want me to sign something . Signing papers has been the major occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small silver bell . Sarah Ann Parker emerged with a promptness that suggested she had been watching from the windows of the kitchen in the east ell . " How 's tricks , Trader ? " The familiarity of the woman 's greeting deepened the red of Armstrong 's already sufficiently ruddy face . " I hear Ally 's come for a visit with you . How is she ? " " Fine . Still young and smart for your age , I see , Sarah Ann . " His unctuous voice had sharpened to razor edge . Holding the laden tray Sarah paused halfway to the door which opened into the kitchen . " Smart ? Why not , Trader ? I 'm only sixty , five years younger than you . Wearin ' bach buttons in your coat ? bachelor buttons an ' you a widower . Kinder got the signals ! nixed , have n't you , Trader ? " She winked broadly at Cindy . A moment later the door to the kitchen closed with a bang . " That seems to be that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl Sarah Ann Parker had a tongue sharp as a serpent 's fang . Age has n't dulled it . My sister , Alida V:i  | Barclay , wants to meet you , Mrs. Stewart . She will call , after which we hope you will dine with us . " Having observed the social amenities he drew a letter from a long envelope , tried to tilt back in the chair , which refused to tilt , and laid the paper on the glass table . " This is from Kenniston Stewart in answer to my letter asking if he would consent to the annulment of the marriage . " " Consent ? That was a silly question to ask . He wants his freedom as much as I want mine . " " Asking his consent is a matter of form to be filed with the records of the case . " " Does he say why he did n't answer my question , shall I sell the oil holdings ? " " Read the letter aloud . I 'd like to hear it . " Cindy picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , read : I have been away from the base on an assignment , have just received your letter and Mrs. Stewart 's so he thinks of me as Mrs. Stewart , that 's a laugh re the sale of our holdings . I am in no position to advise . Fortunately a fellow officer , an engineer and authority on patents who knows something of the country in which our property is located , is returning to the States . I have appointed him my proxy to relieve her of some responsibility . He has a power of attorney , which automatically cancels the one I gave to Mrs. Stewart . He will confer with her and with you . Whatever he advises is my decision . I trust him implicitly . As to the annulment , I am all for it . It was a crazy contract . I will sign any papers that will annul it , but , I suggest that it wait until after the property is sold ? if it is sold . The marriage was cooked up to protect the holdings , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | However , I will leave that to the judgment of you and Colonel Bill Damon ? Bill , not William ? who has been commissioned by me to decide that matter also . Yours truly , KENNISTON STEWART " I wo n't delay the annulment . " Cindy crushed the letter in her hand . " Who does Ken Stewart think he is ? My overlord ? Forward the papers he should sign , Mr. Armstrong . I f he does n't reply would n't it mean , case uncontested ? I 've seen an expression like that in accounts of divorce trials . I f he thinks I 'll let this other man decide what I am to do , he has another think coming to him . What is this deputy 's name ? " She smoothed out the crumpled sheet . " Colonel Bill Damon . Ever hear of him ? " " No . I doubt if we do . A man who has been abroad for years wo n't bother himself with another chap 's troubles , he 'll have plans of his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property . I 'm boarding a plane tonight for the oil holdings , be back in a week . You have the power of attorney Stewart sent you . That 's good till this other shows up , if it ever does . " " Ken Stewart advises the sale first . If he is n't sufficiently interested to come home ? do n't tell me he could n't get leave after all these years if he wanted it ? and attend to the matter himself , I will take over . We 'll crack that marriage contract first . " " I agree with Stewart . The sale first . You have an excellent offer . If you wait you may lose it . Are you sure you want to sell that valuable property ? " " Yes . I think you should know that Kenniston Stewart loaned his father and mine the capital ? he had inherited his mother 's fortune ? with which to lease the land , develop  | their patents , buy the needed tools , and drill test-wells . As fast as income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pay the balance into Ken Stewart 's account . Since he died I have done the same , until now my share is free and clear of indebtedness to him . " " You 've been very wise for one so young , Mrs. Stewart . " " I could n't bear the thought of owing money . This letter has steeled my decision . The annulment of the marriage first . I wo n't wait a minute for that deputy of Ken Stewart 's who may never come . I ? What is it , Sary ? " she asked of the woman who appeared at the door . " There 's a man on the phone who wants to speak to you . Says he 's a friend of your husband , says his name is Bill Damon . " Surprise brought Cindy to her feet . She looked inquiringly at Armstrong , before she said crisply : " Tell the gentleman that I am too busy to see him now ? or ever . "  | WITH a 35 mm. camera containing color film hung from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change her violet and white checked play-suit for swim clothes . She drew a deep breath of the briny air straight off the ocean . What a day . The sandy beach curved in between two low promontories walled by jagged brown boulders . The white frilled tide flowed and ebbed lazily . Far out beyond a stationary float breakers broke whitely against a reef with a rhythmic Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! Life and color everywhere . A balloon man surrounded by near-naked youngsters occupied stage-center , his green and red and yellow spheres bobbing and tugging at their strings against a backdrop of clear blue sky and malachite sea . Children digging . Building . Licking arsenic-green Popsicles . Dogs watching hungrily . Gay umbrellas . Canopied chairs . Figures outstretched on the sand in colorful scraps of clothing staring up at the sky through the black lenses of sunglasses . Man and woman pacing the beach , her multicolored parasol a moving splash of vivid color . Gypsy in enormous hat peddling baskets . Stout woman with anklelength skirt wading . Diminutive black cloud of sandpipers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the step of a pavilion applying lipstick . Flashy man in black-andwhite check suit , soft hat drawn low over one eye ogling her . Human interest . They were both facing her . Something fa- miliar about the tough guy . She focused her camera on the couple and snapped it . The man must have heard the click , for he eyed her with a baleful glare . Little boys tumbled in and out of the lifeguard 's dory drawn high on the beach . That lifeguard . Jim d'Arcy . His first season here . Bossy creature . Female admiration had gone to his head . He rated admiration . She would hand him that . Tall , slim , straight as an arrow . Lean hips . Brief sky-blue trunks on a perfect body beautifully tanned . With wings on his white cap and at his heels , his right arm raised , his left upholding a caduceus , he would be Giovanni di Bologna 's bronze Mercury come to life . She made a little face in his direction . She had had two tilts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his boat to remind her that swimmers were not allowed beyond the float , as if she had n't just realized that she was out of bounds . Of course he had been in the right , but his manner had infuriated her . She entered the bathhouse barely avoiding collision with a woman going out . She looked after the **35;552;TOOLONG clothed figure with its unbecoming rolls of flesh and shook her head . After spending hours on this beach , observing the swim clothes many women wear , no one ever will convince me that my sex is vain , she told herself . Her cap matched the string of large turquoise-color porcelain beads at the base of her throat , as in a white sharkskin suit with a brief pleated skirt she ran toward the shore . As she passed the pavilion she heard the girl in the red swim suit say : " I 'll try . Give me time ? " " Shut up , " a low voice warned .  | The black-and-white check man and the girl whose pictures she had snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was being given the come-on , Cindy decided before she waded into the water and struck out for the float . " Come back ! " A man 's shout . That pesky lifeguard again . She was n't anywhere near out of bounds . She glanced up at the plane only a trifle less blue than the sky , deafeningly thrumming above her head . Another call . What did it mean ? She raised her shoulders from the water and looked ahead . A motorboat just beyond the float was making a beeline for her . Was the person at the wheel stark mad ? She looked again . There was no one at the wheel . The boat was running amok , was headed for her with diabolic intent . Memories of stories she had heard of swimmers beheaded or rendered footless by a propeller blade , panicked her , paralyzed her arms and legs . She must make the float . Her haven seemed miles ahead in a rough jade-green sea . " Steady . Take it easy ! " The voice rose above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragged her down , down , down . Instinctively she closed her lips and eyes . It seemed but an instant before she rose to the surface and a breathless voice encouraged : " It has gone over us . You can make the float . Only a foot ahead . " A huge wave made by the careening boat , a hand on her wrist , and another under her armpit lifted her to the rough boards . She clung to an iron ring . The lifeguard had disappeared . She 'd never call him bossy again . Had he gone  | under ? Had he been struck by the propeller while saving her ? She flung herself flat and reached down with one hand . " This way . This way , " she called . " Grab my arm and I 'll pull you up . " A black head appeared . A voice shouted . " Get back . I 'm all right . Hold on . Another giant swell coming . " One hand gripping the iron ring , the other clutching the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water swept over her and knocked the breath from her body . She opened her eyes as a man with her blue cap in one hand pulled himself up beside her ; sat back on her heels , shook water from her hair , and looked up into clear gray eyes in a tanned face . The bracelet man . " You ? I thought it was the lifeguard . Thank heaven you 're safe . If anything had happened to you because you came to my aid ? " " Forget it . Here 's your cap . O.K. ? " " Yes . Still a trifle jittery . I was frightened . I had visions of appearing in the future with my head tucked under my arm like the headless horseman when in pursuit of Ichabod . Do n't look at me as if you suspected I 'd gone haywire . Talking like a house afire helps me relax . It seems painfully inadequate to say Thank you . ' I would n't have made it without you. , , " Stop imagining gruesome possibilities . The crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped piling up on the ledge . Out of our lives forever . " " How far will it run ? " " Till the gas gives out . " " What do you suppose became of the skipper ? Drowned ? " She shivered .  | " It is more probable that a new owner , wet behind the ears , started the engine , then stepped out of the boat for something , and the cagey thing shot off on a little joy ride of its own . Why did n't you turn back when I shouted ? " " I thought it was the brand-new lifeguard getting bossy . We have had two showdowns . I 've been bathing on this beach all my life , it 's more fun than going in alone off The Castle shore . I thought the hum I heard was from the plane overhead . " " I was the lifeguard , pro tern , while the boy went for his lunch . Ready to go back ? " " I 'll sit here and sun for a while . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion , but I like to finish a job I start . You are still shaking . " She had hoped he had not noticed her poorly suppressed shivers . " It 's a silly reaction I have after fright . I acknowledge I was scared stiff . I could n't move . It really does n't mean a thing . It 's just the way I 'm made . " She kicked the water into foam to emphasize indifference . " If you feel that way about it I 'll go . I can see Jim d'Arcy 's white cap . He 's back on the job . I 'll leave you and report to him . " He dived . " Do n't ? " she snapped her lips together before the word " go " escaped . The thought of being left alone panicked her . Never before had she been afraid of the ocean . Slowly she pulled on the turquoise blue cap . The yellow beach where the tide ruffled whitely seemed miles away . Could she make it ? A brown hand with a seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet head appeared . A shoulder with an ugly jagged reddish scar followed . White teeth gleamed in a strongly lined bronzed face .  | " How about it ? Ready to be good and come along with me ? " " Am I ? Watch me . Just watch me . " She slid into the water . He fitted his stroke to hers . They swam toward shore side by side till they could touch the sand with their feet , then waded in . They walked up the beach to the music of " Good Luck and the Same to You " coming from a portable radio . " I saw British Tommies marching to that tune just before I left London , " he said . " Better stop a minute . You are still breathless . " She sank to the sand beside a colorful plaid beach robe , and pulled off the turquoise blue cap . " The stiffening appears to have oozed from my knees temporarily . I 'll sit here till it returns to normal . A million thanks for your help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I go in for a rescue stunt I hang around till I am sure my patient is O.K. " His straight body was as brown as the lifeguard 's , his trunks as blue as the sky . He pulled on the gay beach robe . " As you see , I like exuberant colors . With your permission . " He dropped down beside her . " We 're about the only persons left on the beach except d'Arcy and the girl in the red one-piece snuggling up to the man in the loud suit , " he observed . " I snapped a picture of them , they seem so out of character on this beach . Later they were quarreling as I passed . They seem to have made it up now . I have the most curious feeling I 've seen him , the tilt of his hat , before . " He laughed . " Sure you have . In the movies . That is bad boy Humphrey Bogart 's tilt to the fraction of an inch . " He drew a package  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach robe and offered them . " Have one ? " " No , thanks . " She waited until he had blown a smoke ring or two . " Did your Sally like the bracelet ? " she inquired . " Sally was improvised at the moment to give the hatchetfaced Ella the impression that you and I were old friends . I bought it to send to a homesick woman overseas . " " You did n't fool Ella Crane for a minute . She fancies she 's psychic . She has been owner and head bottle-washer of that shop for years . It is not only a listening post , it is a major clearing station with broadcasting facilities for town gossip . That woman has seen me grow up and never lets me forget the fact . " " Then you are grown-up ? " She liked the way his eyes which could be piercingly keen collaborated with his mouth when he smiled . " Certainly I 'm grown-up . I have been handling business affairs for three years and not as a child prodigy , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . What 's happened to your hair since yesterday ? Your head is covered with short curls . " " I had it cut this morning . Fortunately it has a natural wave . " She ran the fingers of her right hand through the wet hair . " It will look more presentable when it dries . " " Even wet it has a golden glint . I thought the chatty Ella called you Cinderella . Right ? " " Right . It is my name , worse luck . Now do n't quip , Has the Prince found your slipper ? ' It was amusing the first time I heard it , but it has lost its rapier edge . " He threw back his head and laughed a spontaneous laugh  | of genuine amusement which made one think , " What a bright girl am I. " " Good line . Sorry I did n't think of it first . " Stretched out at length , resting on one elbow , he began to scoop , mold and pat the sand till it assumed outlines . Fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny turret to the structure . " As there is no Prince in the offing , another castle for Cinderella , " he explained . " It 's a masterpiece . Even to the little windows . Pity the tide will wash it away . " " The castle for my Cinderella ca n't be washed away . It will be built on a rock . " " Are you ? " she remembered the jagged scar ? " were you an architect before you went into the service ? " " As an avocation only . I have helped my friends when they made over old houses . Sometimes I help them in other ways , also ? I was off to a good start as a consulting engineer when Uncle Sam called me . " A quizzical light in the eyes that challenged hers when he said " Sometimes I help them in other ways also " clanged a warning . She sprang to her feet . " You are Bill Damon , " she accused . " Why did n't you tell me ? "  | HE SWEPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? You refused to speak to him when he phoned . I could n't very well stop and introduce him when that boat was shooting for us , could I ? " " I still do n't want to talk with you . " " That 's just too bad . Because I am in this town to stay and we are likely to meet . Remember I told you that when I started a job I hung on till it was finished ? " " Are you referring to the job for Kenniston Stewart ? " " That is one of them . " " Why does n't he come home and settle the matter himself ? " " Why are you so bitter against Ken ? Is it a defense mechanism ? Not in love with him , are you ? " " In love with him . That 's the funniest thing I ever heard . I 've never even seen a picture of him ? and you may be sure he never has seen one of me . I refused to send it , not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion . Did n't the chatty Ella tell you the story of my life ? I 'll bet she did , pulling out all the stops . I 'm the town 's Exhibit A. Have n't you heard about me from the man whom you are here to represent ? " " Yes , but I would like your side of it . I want to be absolutely fair . Why did you do it ? " " Do what ? Marry Ken Stewart or start the annulment ? "  | " Let 's take first things first . Marry ? " " At the time it seemed the valid solution of a problem . He and I consented to help his father and mine . Because looking back it seems a cockeyed proceeding does n't alter the fact that it appeared to be the only way out then . " " Sit down again , please . Be sensible . Let 's thresh out this matter of your aversion to Bill Damon and get it behind us . I 'd like to be friends . Believe it or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . " After an instant of hesitation she sank to the beach . He dropped down beside her and clasped his brown hands about his knees . Her eyes were on her fingers , through which she sifted sand . " This is a lot more comfortable , " he approved . " Now that the smoke of battle has cleared , I can see no reason why you and I should be enemies , even if you detest the man whom I am here to represent . I ca n't make a move till I know your side of it . First , having decided it was wise to contract the marriage , why dissolve it ? You and Ken still hold the property . " " Apparently Ella Crane omitted the fact that the ardent bridegroom has not been interested to return to this country and take his share of the business load .

There was n't a proxy . The deed was done by signed contracts . " Her mouth widened in a smile . " Tom Slade who was in the office of the lawyer who repre-sented Father 's interests is tall , slender , lithe , blond and terribly good-looking .

There has been no time for either of us to be terribly in love . ' You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang to her feet in response to the voice . A fair-haired , hatless man in gray flannels followed his hail as fast as he could make it with his feet sinking into the sand at every impetuous step . He caught the girl 's hands eagerly extended . " You 're terrific in that white swim suit , lovely . The three years are up and here I am . " His jubilant smile changed to a scowl as he became aware of the bronzed man in the plaid beach robe standing beside her . " Who 's your friend ? " Cindy glanced up into the keen eyes intently watching her . Something in them sent the color in a pink tide to her hair , caught at her breath . She put her hand to her throat as i f to relieve the tightness . " Ile is n't my friend . He claims he is here as my almost ex-husband Kenniston Stewart 's trusted adviser . He has put on a good act but not quite good enough . I 'm wondering . Let 's go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a flippant nod to the man regarding her with inscrutable eyes tot &; a step forward . " Just a minute ! " She stopped at the sharp command . " A  | few moments ago you declared I was Bill Damon . Now you intimate I am someone else . Better hop off the fence and decide who I am . It will make a heap of difference in your future . Good morning . " She watched him as he strode toward the bathhouse before she turned puzzled eyes to Slade . " Now I am mixed up . Who do you think he is , Tom ? " " How would I know ? Never laid eyes on the fella till a minute ago . If you ask me , I 'll bet he 's a guy horning in for a take when the oil property is sold , like one of those fiveper-centers being front-paged in Washington . Jupiter , why the heck are we spending a minute on him ? Hustle into some clothes and we 'll go somewhere and celebrate . " Cindy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was scratched around the keyhole as if a knife had been applied . She unlocked it quickly . The contents had not been disturbed . Who would try to get in ? For what ? She had a sudden vision of the baleful eyes she had met when she clicked the camera . The man in the black and white checks . Had he tried to get the film ? He would n't be allowed in this locker room . The girl ? She had said , " Give me time , " and the man had snapped , " Shut up . " Had he reason for not wanting to be photographed ? " Hi , Cindy ! I 'm waiting ! " In response to Tom Slade 's call she dressed hurriedly and slipped the cord of the camera over her head . " Forgotten we 're going places , Cinderella ? " he reminded as she appeared in the doorway . " No , Tom . " She glanced toward the pavilion . The man and the girl in the red swim suit had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aqua linen shirtwaist frock and fastened a pink rose at the opening of the Eton collar . Later , seated in Tom Slade 's Town and Country convertible , she had the curious feeling that Time had given the day a shake and her life had fallen into an entirely different pattern as the colored fragments shift in a kaleidoscope . " Had your hair cut , " Slade observed . " It 's terrific , lovely . Whither ? You know the high spots here . We 'll make a day of it . O.K. ? " " Double O.K. Are you staying at the Inn ? " " Uh-huh . Arrived this morning early . " " Let 's stop there and inquire if a man named Bill Damon , Colonel Bill Damon , is registered . You can tell the clerk you are expecting a friend and are interested to know if he has arrived . " " Why the fictional approach ? Do you still doubt that the guy on the beach is the person he claims to be ? " " I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent Kenniston Stewart . " " You do n't need anyone to represent Kenniston Stewart . I 'm here . " " I know you are here and I 'm worried . Something tells me you had better keep out of the limelight . Page Counselor Armstrong for confirmation of that opinion . To return to  | the man we left behind us . You sold me on the idea that he might be other than he claims when you said : " I ' 11 bet he 's a guy horning in for a take when the oil property is sold , like one of those five-per-centers being frontpaged . ' " She had a close-up of the man 's steady eyes , his suggestion of invincibility . " He gives me a shivery sense of ruthlessness , but much as I dislike him , I believe he is honest . " " But , not so sure that you do n't want to check on him , are you ? Here we are at the Inn . Snappy outfit with prices in character . I 've never seen such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the State of Maine . " He whistled softly . " And here comes a sliver of pulchritude who fits into the picture , " he declared as a girl in white linen blouse and shorts , tennis racquet under her left arm , ran down the broad steps . Her short hair was definitely red , not auburn . Her eyes were definitely green , not hazel . She stopped beside the convertible with a dramatic start of surprise . " Cindy Clinton , as I 'm alive ! " Her eyes lingered for a split second on the man at the wheel before they flashed back to the girl beside him . " Or is it Cinderella Stewart now ? Is this the absent groom returned to claim his bride at long last ? " The mocking voice sent hot color to Cindy 's hair . Cat ! Pride conquered anger . " Wrong number , Lyd . " Her voice was miraculously gay considering the tumult within . " May I present Thomas Slade , attorney , from the great open spaces . Tom , Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championship last year . " Slade , who had stepped from the car , gently pressed the hand Miss Fane eagerly extended . El  | " I ca n't see you as a runner-up , " he declared smoothly . " You look like champ material to me ? in every way . " " Tom is staying here at the Inn . " Cindy was giving the girl a chance to think up a reply worthy of the saccharine tribute . " His tennis is something to write home about , too . " " Really ? " The green of Lydia Fane 's eyes deepened . " There are so few men here you 'll be mobbed , Mr. " Has n't my pal Bill Damon checked in yet ? " Tom Slade 's surprised question cut into the prophecy . " Do you know him ? Sure he is here . We are all crazy about him in spite of the fact that so far he does n't know we are on earth . Hands off , Mrs. Stewart , " the green eyes flashed to Cindy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a nice deluxe station-wagon type , is n't it ? ? but his is one of those new club coupes , long and dark green and sensational . The garage man told me it has a hundred and five horsepower engine . Mr. Slade , we 'll plan some tennis . I 'm late , I 'll be seeing you . By ! " She dashed along the drive and opened the door of a light gray sedan . Tom Slade waited until her car had coasted out of sight before he started his . " Huh ! The fair Lydia certainly punctured my belief that T was buying something snappy when I bought this car , " he griped . " You did . It 's a beauty and the latest and smartest model I 've seen this summer . Do n't mind Lyd Fane . She always eaves a thorn pricking in one 's heart . " " I knew that when she took the first crack at you . What did you think of my cagey inquiry about my pal ? what 's his name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtlety . Now that I know he is the person he claims to be let 's forget him and  | get on with our day . In spite of your recognition of her claws , you fell flat on your face for the lovely Lydia , did n't you ? " " She asked for it . I 'll bet her tennis does n't touch yours . Something tells me that life here will have its points while I wait for you to be free . Relax . I wo n't say any more . Just want you to realize why I am here , that no green-eyed Circe can come between us . Where shall we lunch ? Remember I am from the interior , and make it lobster . Sea air has made me ravenous . After that we 'll paint the Maine shore red and I mean red . " After lunch at the Lobster Pound they stopped at the Country Club to watch the tennis . Cindy went into the house to make out a guest card for Tom Slade . When she returned he was surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a car which was the last word in smartness , performance and speed , they skimmed along black roads bordered in places by thickets of sumac and sassafras ; the pale gold and purple of goldenrod and asters ; past cultivated fields where sleek , well-fed black and white cows placidly chewed their cuds ; by neglected fields coming up to broom sedge grass . From a towering pine the noisy " Caw ! Caw ! " of a crow convention rent the air . Past rocky shores , echoing with the thunder of white-capped breakers , beyond which stretched an illimitable expanse of sapphire blue and dark green ocean . A briny breeze stirred Cindy 's short hair and tugged at Slade 's luridly hand-painted tie . He talked of his ambition politically , of his hopes and plans for the future , of her part in them . She interrupted : " Not now , Tom , do n't talk about me now . I asked you not to come here till the annulment of that crazy marriage had been granted . Your presence may start unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay there is to be no mention of love or marriage between us . " " O.K. , that 's so like you . You wo n't drink or smoke or play cards for even a penny a corner , but you 're the girl I want . I 'll be cagey and concentrate on the dames at the Inn , only do n't run away with the idea I 've gone cold on you . Are you afraid that guy Damon  --  the snappy Lydia nailed his identity for fair , I guess there 's no doubt he is here to represent the absent groom ? will report to Stewart if we are seen together a lot and tie up the release ? " " No . Ken Stewart wants his freedom . During the years since the marriage by contract I have given no one a chance to gossip about me ? you know I would n't go out with you unless others were in the party . " " Do I know it ? You bet I do . In spite of the chaperons we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes we copped for our act ? " " I do . There is a rink a few miles from here , highly respectable , in fact verging on top-drawer . I 've been planning to go there some day . My skates are in the turret room at The Castle . " " Remembering the fun we had , I brought mine on the chance there would be a place to use them . We 'll smash a few more records with our turns and whirls . " " Meanwhile , play with the attractive girls at the Inn , give them the time of their lives . " " Suppose I fall for one of them ? " " All right with me . Better now than later . ' " Jupiter , you 're a hard-boiled critter , Cindy . " The bracelet man had said that , only he had called her a female , not a critter . " I do n't see why ? Because I intend to have my next mar- riage ? if there is one ? of the till death do us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They dined and danced . Stopped for a late snack . It was midnight when Cindy softly closed the front door of The Castle behind her . She listened till the purr of Tom Slade 's convertible faded in the distance , then turned the shaded lamp in the hall to low and crossed to the stairs . Foot on the bottom step she stopped . Why go up now ? She would n't sleep if she went to bed . Her mind was in a hectic tangle , mussed like the drawer of her dresser when she had searched it in a hurry . More sensible to curl up on the chaise longue in the patio while she tried to restore order to the impressions of the last twelve hours . She tiptoed through the hall . Sarah Ann Parker was the original watchdog . She slept with one eye and both ears open . Perfect night , so enchanting it made one homesick ? for what ? she asked herself as she snuggled among soft green cushions and stretched at length on the chaise longue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't stopped a minute . I 'm dead to the world . Part of it is because shame at my treatment of Bill Damon after he saved my life has been gnawing at my conscience . " Fragrantly warm air rustled the balsams . A three-quarters moon , already taking on a tinge of autumn ruddiness and attended by a brilliant lady-in-waiting star , grinned down at her with a **29;589;TOOLONG smirk . " Oh ! " The descent of a warm body on her knees jolted the exclamation through her lips . The black Persian cat circled several times before settling down in a purring lump on Cindy 's aqua linen lap .  | " Make yourself at home , Darius , " she whispered as she scratched the top of the satin-smooth head . " At what point in my tabulation of the events of this epoch-making day had I arrived when you switched the dial ? " The cat tucked nose under velvet paws , blinked topaz eyes at the face above and closed them . His rhythmic purr accompanied the monotonous chirp of crickets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the insistent faroff shrill of a tree toad . Shine and blink , shine and blink , a myriad fireflies flitted about the patio and snapped their lights on and off . Head against the downy cushions , eyes closed , Cindy heard again that shouted " Come back ! " ; lived over the moments under water till the crazy motorboat had passed high above their heads ; the following session on the beach . Who was the man ? Why wonder ? Had n't Lydia Fane declared that Bill Damon was registered at the Inn ? Just a minute , gal . Did he ever tell you he was the man of whom Ken Stewart had written to Armstrong ? The question brought her sitting up straight . He said that I refused to speak with Bill Damon when he phoned , that answers that doubt , does n't it ? Maddening that my lawyer is away . Another week to wait . Will he try to see me meanwhile , or was he too annoyed by my doubt of him to care if he ever saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarse whisper brought her to her feet and the sleeping cat with a thump to the flagged floor of the patio . " Good heavens , Sary Parker . You might as well kill me as scare me to death . What 's happened ? " " Sssh-h- ! " The warning hiss came from the figure enveloped in a  | dark bathrobe . Sarah Ann Parker laid a work-worn restraining hand on the girl 's bare arm . " Speak , low , Cindy . We may not be the only folks watching . " " Watching what , " Chills feathered along Cindy 's veins . She was indignantly aware that the huskiness of her voice was going the housekeeper 's one better . " Want to know somethin ' ? That big yacht I told you about is in again . I was lookin ' out my bedroom window ? could n't get to sleep till you came in ? an ' I saw two lights flash . Suppose that Mrs. Sally Drew 's goin ' on the water this time of night ? Do n't seem respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling clarity along the corridors of memory . " You know Sally , " the bracelet man had said . Later he had claimed that the name had been an improvisation . Had it been or was there such a person in his life ? Perhaps he knew this Sally Drew who made mysterious excursions at midnight , perhaps ? he was really here to see her . " My sakes , Cindy , why 'd you gasp as if someone had knocked the breath out of you ? " " Why not ? You 've got me all excited about your mystery hunch , though common sense tells me that dozens of boats come into this harbor and at midnight , too . Why should n't Mrs. Drew go for a sail ? " She glanced at the illuminated dial of her wrist watch . " It is half after the witching hour of midnight . A yacht and a beau to twang a guitar is the perfect answer to this moonlight . Wish someone would invite me . " You 're pokin ' fun at me , Cinderella . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as that . Want to know somethin ' ? There 's a terrible lot of skulduggery goin ' on and it ai n't all bein ' ?  | pulled off in the cities , either . I read in the paper that they 're findin ' that some of the folks that ' pear mighty respectable are mixed up with criminals dealin ' in stolen ? " On the screen of Cindy 's memory flashed a close-up with sound effects of a man in a blatant checked suit ogling a girl in red . He looked as if he might deal in stolen goods and he did n't look mighty respectable , either . " Listen ! " Sarah Ann Parker 's shrill whisper shattered the vision and iced Cindy 's blood already chilled by memory . " Somethin ' at our landin ' . Too late for company to be callin ' . Smugglers ? " She held her breath . The sound was that of a boat bumping against the wood . Silence again , broken only by the monotonous chant of crickets , and the weak chirp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you hear it , Cindy ? " She nodded in response to the whisper , and pulled off Sarah Ann 's enveloping bathrobe . " Give me this . Smugglers ! That 's a laugh . Your imagination has dropped you back more than a hundred years , Sary . I 'll find out who it is , what goes . Hustle into the house . That nightie is shockingly thin for a public appearance . " " I 'm not in my ? " She eluded the housekeeper 's indignant grab . Swathed in the dark garment she stepped from the patio , sped along the green borders of the flower beds to avoid the crunchy pebbles of the path , crossed the putting green . Now she could see the rocky point jutting into the sea , twin to the one on which The Castle had been built . Moonlight picked out the spreading California-type house and spotlighted a pier from which a long , fleecy wake made a path toward the dark horizon . Had a boat returned to the  | yacht ? She stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . A boat was at the oceanside landing of The Castle . Muffled voices . She held her breath to listen . " They 've made the getaway safely . Now we can go . Our job is done for the present . No one awake here  --  luckily for them . " The low voice was followed by the muffled sound of oars . Cindy drew the dark robe closer about her . Its warmth did n't decrease her shiver . What did " luckily for them " mean ? Who were " them " ? The residents of The Castle ?  | THERE WAS an electric fan in action in the old-fashioned room in the small white office on the lawn of the imposing yellow colonial house , White Pillars . A breeze stealing through an open window lightly stirred papers spread on the broad , orderly desk . A ray of sunlight sifting in added a touch of gold . Seth Armstrong in open-neck white shirt tipped back at a reckless angle in his swivel chair , fitted the finger tips of his plump waxen hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the man seated opposite . " Sorry I had to keep you waiting a week , Colonel Damon , but I wanted to check on the oil holdings , leases and patents myself . That 's the way I do business , firsthand information . Your explanation of your presence in our village is confirmed by a letter I received from Kenniston Stewart . Now that I meet you I suspect that your service record is sensational . " " No more so than that of dozens of men who gave all they had and did n't come through . My part in the holocaust Is ancient history . Now I wish to live and work in the present . I am out of active service , though on call if needed . Please drop Colonel , ' Bill Damon to you . I am eager to get Ken Stewart 's affairs washed up that I may get on with my own life . I have a book to write and a partnership as  | the patent man in an engineering firm waiting for me . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Armstrong tapped a legal-looking sheet spread on the desk . " Your power of attorney is in order . Stewart 's signature agrees with those on letters I have received from him . You also have checked on the leases and registration of the patents in use at the oil holdings on the field and in Washington and report them to be unimpeachable ? a rumor got around to the contrary , circulated , I have reason to suspect , by would-be purchasers ? which means that the transfer can go through without a hitch . " " That 's good news . " " Only one person can hold it up . Mrs. Stewart . Have you met her ? " " Twice . " " By your smile I deduce it was a pleasant meeting . I am surprised . I was with her in the garden patio when the housekeeper delivered your telephone message . I heard her declare she would not see you . What happened ? " He told of the runaway motorboat ; of his talk with the girl on the beach ; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advent of Tom Slade . Seth Armstrong inflated and deflated his cheeks as he listened for all the world like a man blowing up balloons for a lot of kids . " He 's assistant to the Western lawyer who put across the written-contract marriage , is n't he ? " he inquired thoughtfully . " What did you think of him , Col- Damon ? " " I had no time in which to form an opinion , he flashed on and off the scene so fast . I have n't seen either of them since that day . Knowing that I could n't confer with you for a week , I spent the time in New York , I had important business there . Cindy Clinton ? as you see , I have picked up the  | name her friends use ? had previously assured me that Slade is tall and terribly good-looking . I 'm willing to take her word for it . Is he the man she is planning to marry when the annulment goes through ? " " If he is she has n't told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a playboy who owns The Hundreds , a spectacular estate here , is determined to make her the third Mrs. I larding . It 's gossip , take it for what it 's worth . I 'd say the Western lawyer has more on the ball . How do you feel about holding off that annulment till after the deeds of sale of the oil holdings have been signed ? It will make only a few days difference , I had a conference with Judge Shelton about it this morning . I think it should wait . " " I agree with you . Optimism is expressed over the near term outlook for the oil industry . I have been informed that so far as one can see production of crude oil will be permitted to rise over the next several months at least . The buyers are eager to acquire the property , which is in the middle of hundreds of acres on which they own mineral rights . I understand that neither Ken nor the girl he married wants to shoulder the responsibility of the business . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is their chance to get out from under with a sizable profit . The lawyer of the buyers waved two checks in the seven-figure bracket practically in my face if I would put my John Hancock on the deed of sale while I was on location , they would obtain hers later . I refused on the ground that Mrs. Stewart and I would sign at the same time . " " Would you get a bigger price if you played hard to get ? " " Undoubtedly . General market conditions permitting oil shares are likely to be in better investment demand over the next few months than they have over the last several ,  | but , I have my orders to sell . Will you use your influence with her to get her to sign ? " " It wo n't be difficult when I explain that the sale first will mean only a short delay to her freedom . Now if you have time I 'll check with you on the financial report . " The touch of gold on the desk vanished , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed and compared facts and figures . Seth Armstrong snapped on the desk light . He glared at the door in response to a knock . " Who is it ? " he growled . " It 's Ally , Seth . You asked me to bring the tea tray at four-thirty . Hurry ! It 's heavy . Open the door ! " Armstrong snatched up his coat from a chair . " Just a minute . It 's my sister , Mrs. Barclay , Colonel . Let her in while I get this on . She detests ? " " I 'll drop the pesky thing if you do n't ? " The tall whitehaired woman in a thin soft green frock opened dark eyes wide and stared at the man who flung open the door . He seized the huge china-laden silver tray which tilted dangerously . " I do n't wonder you are startled , Madam , to see a stranger when you expected your brother to take over . I 'm Bill Damon pinch-hitting for the Counselor at the moment . Where shall I deposit this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if to loosen tension . " On the desk , " her voice was husky . " There appears to be plenty of room . You should n't spring a surprise like that , Colonel ? Damon . I almost dropped the tray when I saw your face instead of my brother 's . Seth , I was an aide in a field hospital when your present guest was brought in with the ugliest wound of the engagement . " " How about the cup of tea you brought along , Mrs. Bar- clay ? Do I smell cinnamon toast ? The Counselor and I have been figuring till we are on the verge of a nervous breakdown for want of nourishment . " " Right . " She seated herself in the chair he had occupied at the desk . " Seth , come out of the coma into which my recognition of your guest ? or is he a client ? ? appears to have plunged you . Sit down , both of you . How do you like your tea , Colonel ? " He drew up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the swivel chair opposite his sister . " Strong . I need a stimulant after your surprise appearance . To reminisce for a split second , Counselor , your sister was shipped to England with me and helped me fight back to life in the hospital . " " It seems as if it happened yesterday , and it was the last month of the war . Time no longer marches on . It is geared to modern tempo . It flies . Here 's your tea , Seth . " Armstrong took a mighty swallow from the cup his sister passed to him and swore inarticulately . " Why did n't you warn me that stuff would scald , Ally ? " he demanded . " Do n't tell me that the superefficient secretary of yours , about whom you brag , serves it cold , " she countered . " Aunt wi inerva still makes the most heavenly toast out of captivity she wo n't allow my maids to do it ? it 's so luscious and finnamony and sugary . Try it , Colonel . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Now that we are through with the prologue , let the play on . Did you come to this town to meet Damon , Ally ? " th Armstrong demanded . " Me ? I never was so surprised in my life as when I recnized the man who opened the door as a onetime patient .  | I had no idea he was in this country . I have n't seen him since the fighting war ended . The one time I heard of him he had been sent on a dangerous mission . " " That mission was supposed to be secret . " " One of those secrets that were circulated to hide the truth ? Now that surprise has given way to curiosity , why are you in this small town ? Bill Damon ? " " I 'll tell you why . " Seth Armstrong deposited cup and saucer on the desk and answered the question . " Remember Cinderella Clinton , Ally ? " " Do you mean little Cindy Clinton , that adorable youngster with a tousle of goldy-brown curls ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me posted on village gossip . Was n't there a story going the rounds that she made a phony marriage ? " " Nothing phony about it . Legal to the last dot of an i . It is about to be dissolved . The Colonel is here to represent the absent husband . " " Dissolved . Another marriage gone wrong . Ca n't you save it , Colonel ? " " No . I am under orders from the husband to conform to the lady 's wishes and the lady says , Off with his head . ' That leaves me no alternative . " He rose . " As we have finished our business , Counselor , I 'll take off . Wo n't you dine at the Inn with me some evening , Mrs. Barclay ? I 'd like to check with you on news of men we both knew . " " I 'd love it . On the chance of appearing to gulp your invitation , I suggest that if you are not tied up we make it tonight . Every other evening this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for you at seven . " " No , thank you . I want to make a short call on the way . " TO LOVE AND TO HONOR 61  | " I 'll be waiting for you at the Inn . The earlier we dine , the better the dinner , I have discovered . That being settled , all right if I drop in with Mrs. Stewart tomorrow morning to sign the deeds of sale , Counselor ? " " Yes , if she will come . The buyers are so eager they have sent checks to the bank here to be turned over as soon as you both sign . If she protests tell her that the other matter , which appears to mean life or death to her , will be held up till the sale goes through . I 'm glad you are here to twist the thumbscrews , Damon . I 'm soft . Good luck to you . " " Something tells me I will need your good wishes . Until seven , Mrs. Barclay . " At five minutes before the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the beach with its lacy capped waves . Was it only a week ago he had rescued Cindy Clinton from that onrushing boat ? The memory of her danger set his hair prickling at the roots . It had been a close call . The stone house on the dark , rugged promontory that jutted into the ocean was The Castle . The estate had the advantage of bordering also on the channel and the harbor which at the moment was presenting a scene of breath-taking beauty . The fiery ball of a setting sun flooded the sky with color . Lights were twinkling on in houses . The horizon , against which a bridge was etched in black , was crimson ; shades of red rayed upward ; planes of pink melted into fields of vivid green which faded into soft yellow at the upper edge which In turn fused into violet where it met and lost itself in the blue sky . The still water in the harbor reflected each colorful shade and tint , each boat large and small at anchor . Mast tops were tipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board became a little leaping flame as the boats swung lazily in the outgoing tide . A few rosy cloud fluffs moved slowly across the darkening sky as if to give one brilliant star the right of way . The beauty tightened his throat , twisted his heart , set him wondering if his plan for the future was ? " Dreaming , Colonel Damon ? " His self-questioning shattered like a thin glass dropped to the floor , he could almost hear the tinkle . The challenging query brought him to his feet . He had a dim recollection that the Inn hostess had presented him to this redheaded girl in a frock as green as her eyes , with a neckline which must be what was currently known as " plunge . " She was remarkably beautiful and knew it , he concluded . " Not dreaming . Feasting on that amazing show of color in and over the harbor . " She glanced at the western sky . " It is nice . " Her eyes came back to him . " The reflection even reaches this porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am Lydia Fane , in case you are scurrying madly in your memory for my name . Do n't apologize . You were introduced to a half dozen of us at once the day you arrived . It would take a master mind to identify each girl . " " Why conclude that I am not master minded , Miss Fane ? " " Then you can smile ? That 's a break . You have appeared so grave and stern since your arrival we 've hardly dared look at you , much less speak . That word arrive ' reminds me , your friend was looking for you a week ago , said he expected to find you here . Apparently he had just come . " " One week ago ? My friend ? " " You have an adorable scowl . " Miss Fane was not inclined to subtlety of approach . " He stopped here with Cindy s  | ( ' linton ? my mistake , Stewart ? to ask if you had registered . " " Now I get you . You mean Tom Slade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom did you say he came ? " " With the village Cinderella . You 'll meet up with her and her pseudo romance before you 've been here long . Meanw  --  liile ? I was tapped to invite you to join us at Canasta this evening . " " Mighty good of you to include me , I like the game , but I ca n't make it . I am expecting a friend to dine with me , and here she is , " he added as a light beige roadster stopped at the drive and a beautifully coifed white head appeared at the car window . " If you will excuse me ? " Ile was at the roadster door held open by a chauffeur as Alida Barclay stepped out . " here I am , Colonel Damon . Scott , come for me at ? " " 1 ' 11 drive you home , Mrs. Barclay , when you are ready to go . " " That will be perfect , Colonel . You need n't come back , Scott , " she said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . She was the most distinguished looking woman present , he thought as he followed her from the dining room . The sweeping black satin skirt , the regal collar of the longsleeved jacket of superb white lace over the low-cut bodice , the long pendant earrings and necklace of pearls , her brilliant dark eyes , her short , silky white hair , suggested a portrait by a master artist of an earlier age . " What would you like to do ? Smoke , of course , I remember that , listen to music , play cards , tune in on video ? " he asked .  | " I want to talk , you may remember also that that was one of my favorite diversions . Let 's find a secluded corner on the ocean side from which we can see the moon rise out of the water . I 'll pick up my wrap . " Her trailing black satin cape lined with scarlet made a dramatic background for the black and white of her costume as they crossed the brilliantly lighted lobby . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen an illimitable stretch of ocean . A faint light where sky and water met heralded the rising moon . Gold stars freckled the indigo dome . The soft breeze that stirred Alida Barclay 's white hair had filched scent from a bed of petunias in its travels . From the house drifted the music of violin , viola , cello and piano . " Listen . They are playing Tschaikowsky 's Sleeping Beauty Waltz . ' Exquisite , is n't it ? " " I do n't wonder you whisper . Combined with the starlight it suggests enchantment , ca n't you hear adventure calling ? You being you , I 'll bet you can . Comfortable ? " He held a lighter to her cigarette , then to his own . " I 'm listening . Talk . " She laughed . " Talk . Just like that . " She glanced over her shoulder . " Sure we are alone ? " " Sure 's shootin ' . The blank wall of the house is directly behind us and the whole Atlantic ocean is in front . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret mission ? " In the dim light he could see her affirmative nod . " You have n't forgotten my one small success , I see . Intelligence has me listed . When the head of the Customs De- partment heard that I had a brother here , I was asked to help run down an elusive gang . " " In this small place ? " His low voice was incredulous . " Yes . Luck is on my side . Seth is at home which fact provided a valid reason for my visit . And I can see your presence here as a fortuitous arrangement devised by Fate . Remember the case we cracked together ? My one and only ? " " I do . I am not on that kind of an assignment here , Mrs. Barclay . " " Mind telling your old pal why you are here ? Ken Stewart ? "  | WIND ! " As he echoed her word , he threw back his shoulders as if ridding them of a burden . " Good Lord , I 'll be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my step . Of all places in the world how did you happen to drop into this Maine coast village where for a few weeks I am trying to conceal my identity , Ally Barclay ? " " Thank goodness you 've dropped that Mrs. ' I told you , I am following a trail . " " I ca n't realize that you are still a government agent . " " Only in this one case . I have the time , and the higher-ups think I have ability . I 'm thrilled to help . Someone must do the work for the country , besides I like it . It 's interesting and exciting . After my war work I 've found it tame to settle down to the life of a socialite . Why are you here under an assumed name ? Are you on secret business or have you deserted from the service ? " He laughed . " No . Officially discharged . I am due in Washington later , after I drop this alias , to receive a citation for exceptional service , ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn me in as a deserter . I am here to try to adjust ? " " Ken Stewart ! A matrimonial tangle ? I remember now . Seth said you were here to represent the absent husband in a marriage to be annulled . " " Sit tight . This will make the terrestrial globe whirl . I am  | the absent husband ? but the lady in the case does n't know that . " " Whirl is too tame a word . I 'm caught up in a twister . Quick , brief me on the situation . I 'm sorry , perhaps you 'd rather not talk about it . " " I 'd like to talk about it , Ally ? it may help assuage an unbearable feeling of guilt ? after you cross your heart and swear that under no circumstances will you reveal a word of what I tell you . " " I swear . " Diamonds on her fingers sparkled in the dim light as she made the sign above her heart . " Enter the moon to witness my promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inched its way from out the dark ocean as in a low voice he told of the reasons for the marriage by written contract ; of his assignment to a job with Death forever stalking or riding at his side ; of his determination as time went on and the two fathers died to keep out of the girl 's way until she could claim separation as a cause to annul the marriage . She had been such a sport , she deserved her freedom and quick . To do it before then might wreck the plan it had been made to protect . " Why reverse your decision by coming here ? " " Two months ago I received a letter giving me the devil for side-stepping responsibility and loading it on the shoulders of the girl who had married me to help save my property ; that is the gist of the first part , the pen of the writer who signed P.A.S . had been dipped in acid . She or he was n't afraid to name names , went on to say that Cinderella Clinton was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two ex-wives on his alimony list . If I did n't care that her health and spirit were being broken by business tares , I ought to be man enough , as her only protector left , 68 TO LOVE AND TO HONOR  | to come back and talk turkey to her before she was eaten alive by a wolf . The argument was undebatable , my job there was practically finished . Here I am . " " Have you seen Cindy Clinton ? " " Yes . " " Did she appear as if spirit and health were being broken ? If you can laugh like that in answer to the question I judge she is n't in grave danger . Did you recognize her when you met ? " " Not the first time . We were in that shop in the village run by ? " " Ella Crane , known to her intimates as the Public Address System . What a break ? for Ella . Did she know who you were ? " " No . A girl standing beside me advised me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of my outfit who was terribly homesick , thought it might cheer her . I mistook her for a teen-ager , her hair was tied at the neck by a broad ribbon , she wore pedal-pushers , a green and white striped blazer , her lovely brown eyes were young , mischievous . Why would I suspect she was Cinderella Clinton ? The woman by that name who had sent me long , formal reports and monthly statements , which contained no personal touch except Best wishes ' at the close , had taken definite shape in my imagination as a tall , spare individual , more machine than human , who did n't hesitate to contract a marriage for business reasons , who had about as much sensitivity as a female robot . " " Apparently she had enough of what you call sensitivity to care a lot for that father who was ready to throw her to the wolves . " " By wolf do you mean me ? " " Who else ? Is she attractive ? "  | " Lovely . I 'd say sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of character . I know that last from her letters , also drive , and combativeness , I learned those traits the day we met the second time . She has a charming voice and a nice sense of humor . " He laughed as he thought of the reference to the " Prince . " " The plot thickens . I see , said the blind man . I agree with the writer of that letter . It was your job to take the first plane back to relieve that poor girl of the business responsibility . " " You 've got her wrong , Ally . No one could think of her as poor girl . ' She has too much vitality , charm , poise . " Thoughtfully he blew a few smoke rings . " I 'm sure I was right not to return . Right ! ' I could n't have come home before . I had been assigned to an organization job in the airlift . Do you realize what Operation Vittles accomplished ? I bet you do n't . It made 275,000 flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal and often emergency supplies in Berlin for the city 's civilians . " " I 'd forgotten the Herculean task accomplished . How many of the citizens of the good old U. S. remember if they ever knew , do you suppose ? " " One in a million , perhaps . They ought to remember . Every mother 's son of them should be made to realize that the cost was $500,000 a day and that seventy airmen lost their lives . General Clay had some of the best airmen in the British and American forces supporting him . Mine was a job of terrific responsibility , I made uncounted flights with my men . " " Responsibility . Your voice shows the strain as you tell of it . I wonder you are alive . I thought the blockade was formally lifted last July ? "  | " It was , but the airlift kept up delivery of supplies as insurance against more blockades . It 's tapering off but the framework will remain . I wish I felt sure it wo n't be needed again . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was allowing the girl who had married me to carry the load of the oil holdings . I spent hours considering the situation . I argued that if I could go back and we did n't live together , as of course we would n't have ? she would have been outraged at the suggestion ? the persons against whom the marriage had been planned as a defense might try to invalidate it . " " Is n't that argument still good ? If you are so sure you were right why come now ? " " The playboy ' menace bothered me . I could come now . I thought I explained that . " " Really you came because of a letter probably written by a village crackpot ? initials do n't save it from being anonymous ? or maybe , by a girl who wants to be the playboy 's number three wife herself . " " Could be . Do n't think I did n't weigh both of those possibilities . Having made up my mind to come I moved with speed . My service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . Flew to this country . Bought a car . Spent several weeks at the oil holdings under my own name ; arranged the terms of sale ; had a day in New York to stock up on civilian clothes and start inquiries about a certain person ; arrived in this village after the third anniversary of the marriage had passed ; that fact will give Cinderella Clinton an uncontestable case of desertion or separation , whichever it is . " " All this under the name of Bill Damon . How could you get away with it ? "  | " No , no , you misunderstand . I adopted the alias for this town only . I wrote to your brother that my friend Colonel Bill Damon would arrive as my deputy . My plan was running along pn oiled wheels , till you appeared there had been no hitch . " " How ungallant to refer to me as a hitch . " He smiled in sympathy with her gay laugh . " Seriously , Ken , I think you have started on a dead-end street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mistake , Stewart ? " " We had made a fair start on the friendship road when Slade appeared . Then something roused her antagonism again . " " Again ? " " Yes , she had resented the fact that Ken Stewart had sent me instead of coming himself to settle the business and other matters . " " Other matters refers to the annulment , I assume . How about this Hal Harding menace ? " " Do you know him ? " " Certainly I know him . He 's a lot younger than I , but he was the rich little boy who went to prep school while the rest of the youngsters his age went to High . He came here summers and made love to each of the girls in turn . He 's a charmer . What are you planning to do about him ? " " I have n't taken up that matter yet with the present object of his affections . Give me time . This is my third day here . I was away a week . " " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Do n't bite . You know perfectly well that I am referring to your wife . " " I have n't a wife , really . If you mean Cinderella Clinton ,  | of course I shall let her go . Let her go ? That 's a joke , I could n't hold her to that written contract if I wanted to , which I assure you I do n't . " " Ken Stewart , you exasperate me . You were always the most unimpressionable man . You never went off your head as other patients did about the lovely aides in the English hospital . I was so much older than you that your indifference did n't touch me . I used to wonder if you had left a girl behind you . " He clasped his hands behind his head and tipped back the chair against the wall of the house . " No , sometimes I wondered myself why I did n't fall for the lovelies . Must have been because all my jobs have been dangerous . Death kept his reminding hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and women had no place in my life . " " Now that is over , no reason why you should n't go off the deep end and soon . " " Not until this annulment goes through . Technically I am a benedict . " " Suppose you fall in love with this girl , who I deduce from your description is adorable ? " " I face the possibility as one of the hazards of my present life , Mrs. Barclay . " " Gone dramatic on me , have n't you ? I caught your grin , even in this dim light , it was in your voice , too . Watch your step , Bill Damon , pro tern , or you may wake up to the fact that you have lost something you would give your life to keep . Somebody said , sounds like the immortal William S. , Who ever loved that loved not at first sight ? ' " " It was Marlowe . Shakespeare quoted it in As You Like It . You see , I salvaged something from my college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fours and leaned toward her . " Ally , the followers of the Prophet have a proverb , Leave the future to Allah , and pitch a tent for today . ' My tent is pitched . " He held a lighter to her cigarette then to his . " Period . Let 's drop my affairs and get on to yours . What secret mission brought you to this village ? Why is my presence here , I quote , a fortuitous arrangement devised by Fate ? " She glanced over her shoulder , then up at the dark sky . " The face of the Man in the Moon is so clear I feel as if he were bending an ear to listen . " " Forget him . No one can hear . Go on with your story . " " Remember the treasures we were shown in hidden ternpies and shrines when we worked together on that foreign assignment ? " " Do I ? I strolled into a huge jeweler 's shop while in New York . When I saw the outlay there I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galore we saw set in the eyes and heads of idols , of the strings of pearls , the gold and carved ivory urns and vases . Go on . " " Many of those treasures are being secretly sent to the I lnited States ? by a complicated route to dodge customs ? and the loot sold to finance rebel elements in a country overseas . " " The stuff is being smuggled in to this small seacoast town where each person appears to know his neighbor 's business from A to Z ? Incredible . " " Smuggled is the word . It fits in with the Pirate 's Cove legend . Perhaps that very story suggested this shore as a landing place for the loot . A week ago I was alerted to watch for developments , but the receivers this end must have been  | tipped off . Nothing happened except that a yacht appeared off the twin points : two lights flashed from one of them . It was on and off so quickly that the exact source was doubtful . A speedboat streaked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Later I discovered that the one I saw is the property of the tenant of Rockledge , a rich businesswoman not likely to be interested in stolen goods , so she 's above suspicion . Now I have to start over on the jackpot question , who in this vicinity is on the receiving end ? " " In this vicinity ? Sounds like something thought up by a mystery-story expert . " " Maybe it does but my informant is n't a mystery-story writer . He knows his job . Will you help me ? Do n't answer yet . It 's only fair to tell you that an occupant of The Castle is under suspicion . " " The Castle ? Do you mean Cinderella Clinton 's Castle ? " " Sorry , but that was the tip . Willing to help ? " " Willing ? Sure , I 'm willing . I 'll clear her home of suspicion if it 's the last thing I do . "  | THAT 'S your second birdie , Cinderella . Call it a record for the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hal Harding declared . " I 've got something to say to you . I came early to get ahead of the Western guy with whom a little bird told me you 've been spending most of your time the past week while I 've been away . My speed runabout is at your landing . Come for a spin and cool off . " With her putter Cindy knocked the small white ball idly hack and forth on the velvety green . Better let him talk . A showdown between them was overdue . It would be a relief to get it behind her . " For the love of Mike , why are you staring at me as if you 'd never seen me before ? Cinderella Clinton Stewart , may I present Hal Harding ? He 's been dying to meet you . " She laughed and bobbed a little dancing-school curtsey . " I have long anticipated this pleasure , Mr. Harding . You win , Hal , the sun is blazing . Too hot for the boat . I 'll settle for the patio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll listen , after which perhaps you will let me speak my piece . Ooch , it 's sizzling . I should have worn a hat . Hear that cicada . Is there a hotter sound in the world ? " She stopped on the path . " I wonder if the yacht dropping anchor belongs to Mrs. Drew , the tenant at Rockledge ? It 's sensational . " " Sensational , you 've said it . Whoever owns that boat owns a beaut inside and out . It measures 87 ' X 17 ' X 6 ' . There  | are three staterooms with showers , large main salon with one end equipped for dining . Spacious aft deck . Twin 165 h.p . G.M. diesels , diesel generator . Boy , oh boy , it 's the kind of craft I intend to own some day . " " That description sounds like a yacht broker 's ad in capitals . How come you know so much about the boat ? " " I ? I sailed on her once with a former owner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met her , Hal ? " " No . I do n't want to . I hear she 's downright ordinary . Steer clear of her , Cindy . " " She 's my nearest neighbor . I intend to call . " Sary 's words echoed through her memory . " Every little while a big boat drops anchor off her shore , signals , I guess she goes off in it . Kind of mysterious . Gives me the hibby-jibbies . " " Do n't get mixed up with her , sugar . It 's a darn lot easier to keep out of being friendly than to get out after you 're in , " he warned . One side of the patio was cool and shadowy . Diamond spray from the fountain shot high into the air and fell to the surface of the pool with a refreshing tinkle . Hal Harding pushed the chaise longue back into deeper shade . " Sit here and be comfortable , " he urged . " You are perched on the edge of that white chair as if poised for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No . The cushions make it hot . " She brushed the short curls back from her moist forehead . " The tips of the hollyhocks , phlox and delphiniums are drooping as if they could n't hold up their heads a minute longer . You look maddeningly cool in that open neck white shirt and slacks . How do you do it ? "  | " Peel off your jacket and you 'll be cool . " She started to pull off the bolero of her pale pink cotton frock to bare her shoulders and arms , thought better of it as she noted the appraisal in his blue eyes . Pity that a man so lavishly suppligd with wealth , blond good looks and personal charm , gave one a feeling of distrust . " Why are you giving me the once-over again , as if trying to pick out a suspect from a Rogue 's Gallery ? " " A cat may look at a king , sirrah . Proceed with what you want to say , Hal . I have a date with Counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist watch . " Speed . Speed . We have n't much time . " " This is not a subject to be hurried . " He drew a straight chair to face hers , straddled it and crossed his arms on the top . " Like me , Cinderella ? " " With reservations . " " I know what that means without asking . You think me fickle . No use explaining the reasons for the bust-up of my two matrimonial ventures , you would n't understand . " " T have told you before , Hal , that I am not interested in the reasons . " " We 'll drop that for the present . When will you know the date your annulment case will come before the Court ? " " I hope Mr. Armstrong will tell me this morning . He assured me that he had a decision in my favor nailed down , that it will be granted at once , that I will walk out of the courtroom a free woman . Even at the thought my spirit spreads its wings and soars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " T hear it flutter . Hooray ! That night I 'll give the party of the century at my place to celebrate . "  | " You will not . We 've gone over this before . It is n't decent to make whoopee , I know your brand , over a thing like that . It is too much of a tragedy . " " Tragedy ! Have you gone screwball ? What 's tragic about it ? Why turn sob sister ? You just shouted to the housetops , I ' 11 walk out of that courtroom a FREE WOMAN ! ' " " I did n't shout . " " Have it your way , sugar . I 'm not interested in what you say , only in what you do . The minute you are free , you 'll marry me . Right ? " She shook her head till every short gold-brown curl was in motion . " No , Hal . I will not marry you . I hoped I had made you understand that . " Here was the showdown . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was final . " And furthermore , if you give that party ostensibly for me , I wo n't come . I 'll leave town . " " Why ? Why wo n't you marry me ? I 'm crazy about you . My family is tops , and ? " " Where you came from does n't mean so much to me as where you are going ? and what you are is even more important . " " I suppose you mean by that , accomplishment . I do n't need to work . I can give you everything you want , now . " " Not everything , Hal . I want a man who feels the responsibility of money and power . Wealth creates power , and to my mind responsibility . A man like you should n't go through life doing exactly as he wants regardless of the harmful example he is setting to others who admire him for what he has . " " I get you : my brother 's keeper fixation , what ? " " Do n't sneer . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't . A sense of responsibility when there is wealth and lower is the way I see life , and that 's the way I intend to try to live it , live it with a man who sees it that way too . When I promise to love and to honor ' I 'll mean it with all my heart and soul and mind . " " Hold everything , Cinderella , you have it wrong . In the marriage service the words are to love and to cherish ' ? I ought to know . " His heartless chuckle increased her determination to make him understand . " I still stick to to love and to honor ' ? accent on honor . If you honor a person you 'd be bound to cherish him or her , would n't you ? " His laugh was a shout of derision . " This is a scream . You orate about loving and honoring a husband after having married a man you 'd never even seen . " Her face crimsoned . " I understand , Hal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the know . I did what seemed to me right . Like Arabella Allen , in Pickwick Papers . If I did n't know then what I did want , I know now what I do n't want . " " That means me , I suppose . Nice of you to compare me with Bob Sawyer . Boy , but you 've mounted the rostrum this A.M. Jump down , Cindy . I do n't care how you live your life if you live it with me . I 'll make you happy as a queen . You intend to get rid of Kenniston Stewart P.D.Q. , do n't you ? " In the impelling need to make him understand she had hared thoughts she had n't realized she had , they had formulated and risen to the top of her mind as she talked . He had about as much comprehension of what she meant as had 8o TO LOVE AND TO HONOR  | that flash of gold in the pool . No use to be serious with him . She laughed . " I 'm not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm beginning to wonder . A bird in the hand ? you 've heard that one . Perhaps I 'm not gon na wash that man right out of my hair . " She sang the paraphrase with a hope that she could end a situation now and forever which threatened to get out of hand . " You ca n't have changed your mind ? " The words were hoarse with incredulity . " You ca n't mean that you 're going to stick to that written contract , go through with it ? You 've gone hay- " " Sorry to interrupt at what appears to be a crucial moment , " apologized a voice from the doorway behind them , " but Counselor Armstrong asked me to stop for you and bring you to his office ? Mrs. Stewart . " Cindy wheeled . Bill Damon again . Looking as cool in white as if this were n't the hottest summer day for years . Had he heard her silly declaration about Ken Stewart ? Could he hold up her case in court by repeating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't he under orders to push the matter full speed ahead ? " If you have lost your voice , Cinderella , mine is still in working order . " Harding 's incisive words were tipped with vitriol . " Who are you in the doorway and what do you mean butting into a private conference ? " " Shall I present my credentials to the gentleman , Mrs. Stewart ? " Bill Damon took a step down to the patio . " It will take time and we really should n't keep the Counselor waiting . " I could wring your neck , Mister , for the amusement in your voice and eyes , Cindy thought , before she explained : TO LOVE AND TO HONOR 8i  | " Colonel Damon is here to represent Kenniston Stewart , IIal . We are to sign deeds this morning for the sale of the oil property . The Court has spoken . I must go . " " You bet I 'm not getting in wrong with the Court in this case by detaining you , I have too much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , in a place where we will be safe from officious interruption . Your argument floored me for an instant , but I 'll have an answer . I 'll be seeing you. , , She watched him as he strode down the garden path , switching angrily at the rose border with his putter , watched him cross the green and disappear from sight . A motor hummed . His boat . The sound diminished in the distance . That was that . Now what ? " Who was the gentleman ? You did n't introduce him , " a voice reminded . " I 'm sorry , Colonel . He is Hal Harding . We had had a hot argument and I forgot my manners . " " Could n't have been very hot . He called you sugar . ' " " I know he did . " She brushed her hair back from her warm forehead . " Three times . I never heard him use the word that way before , that sort of greeting from him seems Pt ) out of character . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as infectious as the common cold . Easy to pick up from a person one sees even occasionally . We should be on our way . " " It 's too hot . I 'm not going . Those deeds do n't have to be gned today . " To avoid his intent gray eyes she picked up cars from a gathering basket on the glass-top table and concentrated on cutting bachelor buttons until she had a Sizable bunch . She carefully drew the stems through her belt . " That 's a corking color combination , the deep blue against 82 TO LOVE AND TO HONOR  | the delicate pink of your frock . If you are not going would you mind sitting down ? I ca n't until you do , and as you observed , this is a hot day . " " I can see no reason why you should stand or sit in my garden . You are at liberty to go . " Her defiant eyes glanced quickly away from his which were alight with laughter . " Come on , now , Cindy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a kid . You did that once before . " " O.K. , Mrs. Stewart . You want to get the complications in your life straightened out so you can begin real living , do n't you ? " His authoritative voice sent little tingles along her nerves . " Certainly I do . " Allah be praised he had n't heard that brainless , " Perhaps I 'm not gon na wash that man right out of my hair . " " Then come on , pronto . Armstrong told me yesterday that the sale of the property must go through before he would finish the case of the annulment of the marriage contract with the Court . He and I checked the deeds of sale . As soon as we have signed , you for yourself , and I for Stewart , Armstrong will go along with us , present them at the local bank here , where cashier 's checks for a million bucks , one for you and one for Stewart , will be exchanged for the deeds . " " A million for each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wide with amazement . " Those people offered me two hundred and fifty thousand for the holdings . They claimed the registration of the deeds and patents was faulty and the presence of more oil a gamble . Cheats ! " " Had you given me the sliver of a chance to explain I would have told you the result of my investigation . The  | registration of the deeds and patents is as sound as the U. S. mint , otherwise why the two million offer ? If you say the word , we 'll hold out for more . We can get it . " " But that would delay everything else , would n't it ? " " If you mean the annulment , yes . " " Accept the offer . It wo n't be the first time freedom has been preferred to money . " " They thought they had an easy mark when they offered you a fraction of what the property is worth . Stewart deserves to forfeit his share for dumping the responsibility on a girl . " " But , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind you . I can afford to forget that now . A million dollars . What in the world will I do with it ? All right , laugh . I mean what I say , why would I want all that money ? " " I laughed at the thought of you worrying about the amount . Your Uncle Sam has your welfare on his mind , he will see to it that you are not overburdened with moola , lady . I fell leave you a nice little nest egg to invest . Let 's do it together , you for Cinderella Clinton , I for Ken Stewart . " " Do you mean speculate ? Thanks , no . I 've had enough of that in drilling for oil to last my lifetime . " " I said invest . ' There 's a heap of difference . " " How can we ? You 'll be on your way , wo n't you , as soon as Ken Stewart 's business is finished ? " " No . I 'm planning to remain here until my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tragic devastation , I 've fallen hard for the order , cleanliness and beauty of this village , the tree-shaded streets , the well-cared-for houses and lawns . I like the people , too . How about it ? Shall we set the annulment ball rolling by signing those deeds ? " " Lead on , Sirrah . Do n't mind my flippancy . The pros- pect of ending an intolerable situation , neither maid , wife nor widow ? that gem of rhetoric was borrowed f rorn a nineteenth-century novel title ? has unfolded the wings of my spirit which has been grounded . The moment I am free I shall begin to live daringly . How are we going ? " " My car is outside . " Sarah confronted them in the long hall . " Trader Armstrong just phoned , Cindy . Wanted to know why you was n't in his office ? " " Give him a buzz , tell him I am on my way , Sary . Colonel Damon , this is my guardian angel , Sarah Ann Parker . Colonel Damon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should the introduction send color to the woman 's face as if she were having an acute attack of blood pressure ? " Pleased to meet you , sir . Stayin ' long ?

P for Parker . Reverse the initials and you get P.A.S . You said she is your guardian angel . I have reason to believe you . "  | AMAZING how quickly the pattern of a life can change , " Cindy reflected aloud , as an hour later they drove away from the local bank . " I give you the Cinderella story , From Rags to Riches . You as Kenniston Stewart 's deputy , I for myself sign papers at Counselor Armstrong 's office ; he goes with us to the bank , turns over the deeds and receives two checks in return . I deposit mine to my account and here I am , no longer living on an income that had its ups and downs , with the emphasis on downs , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . " " And a happy one , I hope ? " " Not entirely till the Court grants me the right to resume my maiden name . " " Will you insist on that ? " " Of course . Why the surprise ? " " It jarred me for a moment , you are erasing Stewart so completely from your life . You are right . Where shall we lunch ? " " Do we have to lunch now ? " " Certainly not . What do you want to do ? " " Just beyond here is a bluff that overlooks the ocean . It is a popular spot but likely to be deserted at this time of day . I 'd love to sit there for a while and adjust my mental balance . At the moment my mind feels like a great empty attic which has been swept clean of the accumulations of genera- tions . The last three years have been so packed with problems . " She brushed her hand across her eyes as if to clear them . " I would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U. S. why did Dad have to fall for oil wells ? ' Is it wise to do this ? ' Am I selfish to refuse to contract a marriage ? ' Being shot to the top of the world when a well showed a streak of oil ; plunged to the depths of discouragement when a rush of water followed . " " Did that happen often ? " " Often ? Eight out of ten times . Will I be able to pay the taxes on The Castle this year ? " Are the men who want to buy the oil holdings cheating me ? ' No sooner would I mail ; L monthly statement to Ken Stewart than it was time to prepare another . Why are you looking at me so hard ? " " Better take time off to breathe . Pretty excited , are n't you ? " " Positively balloonish . Those are only a few of my doubts . Lucky I took the course in accounting at college . It was something to which to hold tight . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was determined to be trained for a job in case the bottom fell out of the oil holdings completely . It can happen . " " It not only can , but does . Do we turn here ? " " Yes . Stop at the end of this dirt road . My apologies for , . ) bbing out my troubles on your shoulder , figuratively speaking . The recital has deepened the lines across your forehead . " " That was n't what did it , it was the thought that Ken Stewart should be here in my place , with your head really on his shoulder . " " What an awful thought . If it is all the same to you I 'll pick the shoulder , there is another I would prefer . I am just  | beginning to realize that with all that money I can make some dreams come true . I 'll endow a room at the Hospital in Father 's and Mother 's name ; establish a trust fund to assure the minister of the church here a decent living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a hospital wing , it 's terribly needed . After that I will ? " " Hold everything . If you go on at this rate , that money will be spent before the check goes through the bank . " She laughed . " I told you I 'm floating on top of the world . Leave the car here . We follow that path . Quite a climb , but it 's worth it . " On top of the bluff was a sandy patch in front of a giant boulder . Cindy dropped to the ground , pulled off the pink jacket , and leaned back against the rock . " A breeze ! Is n't this heavenly ? For the first time today I am cool . Sit down . Share nature 's perfect seat . O.K. , if you 'd rather perch on that boulder , you look mighty uncomfortable , if you ask me . Is n't the ocean beautiful ? Shades of green and blue and purple swelling gently on and on until they meet the sky . The six identical sails on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spreading out to windward , exciting to watch even at this distance , is n't it ? I wonder if the yacht headed this way is the one that anchors off Rockledge shore so often ? " " It looks impressive . " " If it is the boat credited to Mrs. Drew it is . Hal gave me a summary of its outer measurements , interior and deck arrangements this morning . If you believe his fervid description it is sensational . " " How come that he knows so much about the yacht ? Is he a friend of the owner ? " " Not this owner . He does n't approve of her . Advised me  | not to call at Rockledge . He said he sailed on the boat when she belonged to a friend . I do n't understand Hal this summer . He used to be gay and charming , ultrasophisticated , of course , but he had a way with him that made one forgive that . Now he appears to be at loggerheads with the world in general and this spot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over her mouth and stifled a yawn . " I beg your pardon . I have the most curious feeling , as if my spirit really is soaring in space , as if I could close my eyes and sleep for an aeon or two now that the care of the oil property is off my mind . It wo n't be really , though , till I make out the tax returns on the sale , for myself and Ken ? " " Ken will take care of his own . " " That 's a break , I 'll tackle mine soon , hang a notice on my workroom door , WOMAN AT WORK , and ? " She yawned again , this time she did n't try to stifle it . Her eyes half closed . " I do n't understand ? " " I do . Stand up , Cindy . Quick . " He caught her hands and pulled her to her feet , held her tight in one arm as her eyes closed . Her head fell against his shoulder . He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said this spot was a popular rendezvous . Suppose a party were to come along now ? Would they believe that she had succumbed to mental exhaustion ? Would they believe his explanation that many a time he had seen a man in his outfit released from hours of the strain of life and death responsibility go to sleep on his feet ? He shook her gently . " Cindy , wake up . Come on , darling , try to walk . I 'll take you home . " No response except her limp body sagging a little in his arm . He must get her to The Castle . She might sleep for  | hours . This was nature 's reaction after the sudden release from years of responsibility . Only one way out , carry her to the car . He picked her up in his arms and kicked the little pink jacket she had discarded ahead as step by cautious step he descended the path . Lucky she was n't heavier . Her weight pulled painfully on the muscles stiffened by the wound on his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling , " he pleaded when he reached the car , but her only answer was to settle her head more comfortably . He lifted her and laid her on the back seat , pulled off his white coat and tucked it under her head for a pillow , covered her shoulders with the pink jacket . " May the gods be with me , " he pleaded as he sent the car ahead , " do n't let us meet anyone who knows us . Lucky the top is up . " " Hi , Colonel Damon ! " It was the predatory Fane girl calling , holding up her thumb as he passed the Country Club gate . The man beside her ? Good Lord , it was Slade ? stepped into the road as if confident he would stop , and called : " Hey , take us ? " He pretended not to see or hear and drove on . That was a narrow escape . Had they seen Cindy they would have thought ? Take it easy , they did n't see her , common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the bank , called to him and waved a sheaf of papers . " Stop ! Take these for your files ? " He ignored the hail , and stepped up the engine . His collar was wilted to a wet rag when he stopped the  | car at the entrance door of The Castle . Now he would have co-operation . Sarah Ann Parker would help him get Cindy to her room , then tuck her into bed where she belonged . He sprinted up the steps and pressed the button concealed in the antique brass knocker . The bell resounded through the house . He pressed again . He must get Cindy into the house before anyone appeared . Was the Parker woman asleep ? llamn ! She had said she was going to the village , to watch television ! That tied that . Now what ? Only one answer . Get into the house . There was a key in the pink bag . Miss Parker had reminded Cindy of it when they came in from the patio . The patio ! If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the steps and followed the drive around a corner . He could . Back to the car . He glanced at the sleeping girl before he drove into the garage and shut off the engine . That path must lead ? " Hey , Cindy ! " The call came from the front of the house . A man 's voice . Which one of her stag line ? She had said there was a shoulder she would prefer to Ken Stewart 's . Had she meant Tom Slade or that piker Harding ? Perspiration trickled down his back . Now he knew how a murderer must feel when trying to get away with the corpus delicti . " Cindy ! " He could hear the ring of a bell in the house . " Hey , Cindy ! " An instant of silence followed by a second shout , then the whirr of an engine , and the purr of a departing automobile . he drew his hand across his damp forehead . Whew , it was hot . He investigated the path . It led through the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another swain  | showed up . He 'd better go to it , not stand here thinking about it . It seemed an eternity before he laid the sleeping girl on the chaise longue and dropped her pink jacket and his white coat on a chair . He returned and carefully closed the door of the garage . That would shut his car away from inquiring eyes for the present . He flexed his stiff shoulder , he sure had given it a workout . Looking down at her he had an instant of panic . She was so quiet . She looked like the little girl who had spoken to him in Ella Crane 's shop . Ought he phone for a doctor ? No . He could n't be wrong . This was the sleep of mental exhaustion . He had seen it scores of times . She would awake refreshed . Her color was good . He laid his hand on her moist forehead , gently picked up her wrist with the other . Pulse was normal . It was sleep . Wilting day . Unbearably humid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the world like an old man carrying a heavy load . Nothing alive stirred . His mistake . A cicada was on the job . The shrill call fairly sizzled . Those pillows must be hot . He withdrew one and settled her head more comfortably , drew off white sandals from feet covered by sheer nylons . If he had water ? Water . He looked toward the door to the house . Of course it would be locked and counterlocked , had n't Sarah Ann Parker said she would lock up ? Water ? What was coming from the fountain but water , gallons of it , tinkling back into the pool ? Even the sight of it was cooling . He drew two handkerchiefs from the pocket of the white coat . He wrung out one of the white linen squares in the cool spray , grinned as he realized that he had made the trip to the fountain and back tiptoe . Crime motif again . He bent over  | the chaise longue and gently bathed the girl 's face , dried it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too deep but she looked cooler . He drew the wilted bachelor buttons from her belt and laid the stems in water at the edge of the pool , then dropped into one of the green cushioned chairs , drew up another for his feet , jerked off his tie and unbuttoned the collar of his white shirt . That somewhat relieved his discomfort . He lighted a cigarette and watched a hummingbird poised above a giant dahlia filching honey from its blush-pink heart . With the exception of spray from the fountain the fanning wings were the only moving object visible . Even the shrill cicada had succumbed to the heat . I 'll relax for a few minutes , then I 'll make a stab at breaking and entering . Another downward step on my career of crime . This is what it must mean to be a baby-sitter , he thought as his eyes lingered on the sleeping girl . " Will you let her go ? " Alida Barclay 's question echoed in his memory . " Of course I shall let her go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mental reservation , that if Cindy showed even the hint of a desire to marry Harding , he would hold up the annulment . Neither had he confided that with his sense of responsibility toward her , which had been roused by the P.A.S . letter , he had used part of his first day in New York to start an investigator on the trail of the playboy . Yesterday he had received a detailed account of the man 's life to date . The most startling item was the statement that the two heavy alimonies he was paying made such inroads on his income that he had borrowed on his principal . Did need of money figure in his pursuit of Cinderella Clinton Stewart ? Doubtless he had posted himself on the value of the oil holdings . " Sugar , " he had called her . Cindy had been  | puzzled by his use of the word , had declared it out of character for him . Curious . It would be interesting to know where he had picked it up . It was evident that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to antagonize her by postponing her freedom on his account . That was a break . Ally Barclay had been right when she had prophesied that sooner or later he would wake up to the fact that he had lost something he would give his life to keep . That realization had been quicker than " sooner , " it had struck like lightning the first time he had seen her . Suppose I do n't let her go ? Suppose I induce Armstrong to hold up the annulment while I try to win her love , his thoughts trooped on . No . No . She has a right to freedom . I do n't want the handicap of that contract marriage . Suppose she said " Yes " ? I never would be sure her conscience had n't dictated the answer . Ally is wrong . Ally . With the name came the memory of her confidence last evening on the Inn porch . The smuggling yarn was unbelievable . Was she being fooled ? He had worked with her before being assigned to the airlift ? there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her job or she would n't have been picked for this one . " Willing to help ? " she had asked . Willing to help with Cindy in possible danger ? She could n't know how willing . He would have the credentials he had used before O.K. 'd , then somehow , somewhere he would pick up a loose end that would reveal the identity of the receiver of smuggled loot . His eyes rested on the sleeping girl . He 'd better quit planning the future and make a stab at getting into the house . It was amazingly simple when he tried it . He braced his  | shoulder against the door in the ell for a mighty push . It opened so suddenly that he clutched the handle to keep from pitching forward . " Is my face red , " he said under his breath . " The darn thing was n't locked . " He entered the kitchen darkened by half-drawn shades . Cool as a tomb . That last was a cheery comparison . An icebox suggested food . He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could toy with something to eat . He opened the door . A whole chicken , roasted . Tomatoes , big , red , luscious and peeled . Looked like mayonnaise in a jar , must be bread somewhere , he had read that it kept fresher in a refrigerator . Right , there it was and sliced thin . He would make sandwiches . When they were finished he Confound that doorbell . Had everyone in town conspired to drop in at The Castle today ? He waited motionless until the second prolonged ring died away . He would make the sandwiches before he brought Cindy into this cool house . Moving her might waken her . A few minutes later he glanced from the window , swore softly under his breath . Harding was crossing the patio . It must have been he who had rung the bell , had he left his car in the front drive ? He was bending over the girl on the chaise . With the intent to kiss her ? Bill Damon opened and closed the door to the patio gently behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned .  | HARDING jumped as if the hand of the law had touched him on the shoulder , wheeled . " Oh , it 's you again . " His angry eyes in a face drained of color met those of the man who had taken a few steps forward , dropped to the open collar of his shirt . " Just what are you doing here , en neglige ? and how ? " Keep your temper , the man looking back at him reminded himself . You 've got to . He pulled a cigarette from the package in the pocket of his shirt and lighted it . " Let 's be civilized and not get into a row , Harding , " he suggested in a low voice . " You know what I 'm doing here . I 'm representing Kenniston Stewart . Cindy told you this morning that she and I had deeds to sign , that we were selling the oil holdings . " " Did the sale go through ? Two million was the price offered , I hear . " The inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . After we left the bank she became sleepy , suddenly , in a minute was as you see her now . You 're an ex-Marine , I understand . You must have seen deep sleep follow prolonged mental strain . " Harding looked from the girl to the man facing him . " What mental strain has she been under ? She 's the most alive , gayest girl in this town . " " I have been told that she has carried the entire responsibility of the oil property that belonged to her father and  | Stewart 's ; has been the court of last resort when there has been a difference of opinion among department managers . This morning after she signed the deeds that disposed of the property she declared in a frightened voice that it seemed as if she were floating in space , then suddenly she was asleep . This excessive heat did its part in her collapse . " " That 's a slick explanation . " " Maybe so , but a true one . " He buttoned the collar of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressed , " What can you do about it ? " which his mind suggested as an effective wind-up . Harding turned suddenly , bent over Cindy and stretched out his hand as if to touch her arm . " Sugar , " he said softly . " I said , do n't waken her . And I mean do n't waken her . " At the low , tense warning Harding thrust the hand he had extended into the pocket of his white slacks and straightened belligerently . " Who do you think you are , giving me orders ? " " I do n't think , I know I am here to pinch-hit in a business deal for the man she married , authorized by him to act in all matters concerning her happiness and safety . I 'm sure had he seen you bending over his wife a few moments ago he would have pinned your ears back , I 'm not living up to orders not to do it for him . " " Is that so ? Now we 're getting somewhere . " Harding took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you two men up to ? " Sarah Ann Parker demanded . Her cheeks were as red as her checked dress . " I see you through the window drawn up like two pugs startin ' to fight . You go ' long , both of you . Who 's that on the chaise longy ? ' Tai n't Cindy . Cindy Clinton ? " She pushed Harding aside with a force that rocked him on his feet . " What 's  | happened to her ? " Her breath caught in a sob . " She been run over ? " " This guy Damon says she 's asleep , Miss Parker . He gave me a song and dance about her being worn out by the cares of business . Phooey . Cinderella Clinton asleep at this time of day . Tell that to the Marines . " " He 's right , " the girl asserted as she slowly swung her feet to the flagged patio . She stretched her arms . Stood up . Swayed a little and steadied . " I was asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you bent over me , Hal . I thought for a minute you had the Sleeping Beauty story mixed with that of Cinderella who was not awakened by a kiss . If the gentlemen will excuse us , Sary , we 'll go in where it is cooler . " Sarah Ann Parker picked up the white sandals and pink jacket and followed her into the house . The patio door banged . " Something tells me you are not the person you claim to be , Damon , " Harding accused furiously . " There 's a report going the rounds that over 250,000 persons are living under assumed names in this country , some of them out-and-out swindlers , some of them posing as glamorous personalities . " " Surely you do n't count me in the glamorous class ? " " You wo n't feel so much like grinning when I get through with you . There is a rumor that queer things are being seen and heard in this neighborhood . From this minute I make it my business to find out who you are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've found out report to me , I 'd like to get in on this mystery at which you 're hinting . I 'm a mysteryyarn addict . Meanwhile ? " he picked up his white coat , opened the door to the house , closed it behind him with a reverberating bang and shot the safety bolt .  | I 've made an enemy of him , he thought as he watched Harding stalk along the path , turn toward the front of the house . Let him find out the truth . I ca n't double for Ken Stewart much longer . I only hope he 'll hold off until after the annulment , when I 'll tell Cindy myself . Keen to know if the property was sold , was n't he ? Had the price down pat . That ties in with the report that he 's desperately in need of money . I do n't like his hint as to a mystery . It may mean danger for Alida Barclay . If she ? He stopped to listen to the sound of feet running down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sarah Ann Parker narrowly missed a collision in the doorway . He caught her shoulder and drew her into the kitchen . " What 's happened ? " he demanded . " Is she all right ? " " Sure , " Miss Parker adjusted her spectacles which were hanging by the band . " All right , ' cept she 's scared ' bout out of her wits . She said she was with you on the bluff , remembers feelin ' terrible sleepy , the next thing she knew she was lyin ' on the chaise longy and Hal Harding was bendin ' over her . ' Fore she could make a move to push him away you spoke . She 's frightened for fear she had an attack of am- am- you know the thing folks have when they forget where they are ? " " You mean amnesia . Nonsense . " He explained what happened . " She has been carrying a big responsibility for years . When it was lifted nature took over and put her to sleep . " She nodded in sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she could n't ever have felt young an ' happy the way a girl her age should feel . Her father was a good man , but a fusser , an ' one of the leaning ioo TO LOVE AND TO HONOR TO LOVE AND TO HONOR ioz  | kind . Everything had to be just as he wanted it or he 'd raise a rumpus . Want to know somethin ' ? Just before Trader Armstrong come to see her the first time she was talkin ' ' bout the business an ' tellin ' about a man named Atlas holdin ' up the heavens on his shoulders an ' then she says , I been holdin ' up the oil business on mine . If ever I get rid of it I 'll sleep for a week . ' " " You see , I was right in my diagnosis . I ? " he stopped speaking as , after an experimental turn of the handle the door from the patio swung in cautiously . As if reconnoitering , a head appeared in the opening . Sarah Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command silence . The two stood motionless in the cool , darkened kitchen as a figure in a pink and white striped dress slipped in and soundlessly closed the door behind her . It was the girl in the red swim suit whose picture Cindy had snapped at the beach . " My sakes , Rena , why you stealin ' into this house as if you was afraid you 'd be caught ? " Startled by Sarah Ann Parker 's rasping query the girl dropped the basket she carried . " Gosh , Miss Parker . You scared me out of a year 's growth . I thought you 'd gone to the ? Coming in from the blazing sunlight I could n't see anything in this dark kitchen . " " Hmp . So I gathered . What do you want ? " " Mrs. Drew has unexpected guests coming to dinner and she wondered if you could spare a dozen eggs . I could n't get one in the village . The cook needs them . " Her voice which had been shaky at first gained assurance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up looks as if you expected to lug home a crate of them . "  | " It is big , I had a lot of things to buy . Can you spare ( he eggs ? " " I can not . " " Nothing in my life , it 's the cook 's problem . It is n't part of my work to market . I was trying to help . Sorry I burst in on what looks to be a secret meeting . " From under long Mack lashes she glanced at the man standing at the window hands thrust into the pockets of his coat . I " Do n't be saucy , Rena Foster . The next time you come into my kitchen knock before you open the door . " " Sure , I will before I come into your kitchen . How long Fince you owned The Castle ? I 'll tell Mrs. Drew that you would n't accommodate her about the eggs . " The door slammed . Sarah watched from the window as she ran across the garden , the putting green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of that , Mr. Damon ? " " Is she in the habit of entering without knocking ? " " Yes , but she was n't enterin ' , ' she was stealin ' in . Did n't you hear her begin , I thought you 'd gone to the ? ' then she stopped short . ' T was her that told me Ella Crane had a television set , an ' she has n't got one . Looks kinder like she was tryin ' to get me out of the way so she could get in for somethin ' , do n't it ? " " Who is the girl ? " " Rena Foster . She 's what 's called a parlormaid at Mrs. Drew 's . Folks say she 's runnin ' round with a tough-lookin ' man who 's tryin ' to get a job at one of the summer places . " A tough-looking man trying to get a job at one of the dimmer places . He mentally filed the description for further reference . " Did n't you have a dozen eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had , you do n't think I 'd get caught with supplies so low I 'd have to borrer , do you ? I did n't like the way that girl came in , something sly about it . ' Twas n't eggs she was after . " " Any suspicion what she would come for ? Ever heard that she is dishonest ? " " Nothin ' that was proved . When she burst in I was just about to ask if you 'd go up and tell Cindy what you told me , that it was natural for her to drop off to sleep . She 's scared it may happen again when that divorce goes through . " " It wo n't , you may assure her of that . She has had no lunch . Tempt her to eat , then suggest that she drive to the Country Club and see her friends . It is too hot for tennis . " " It 's too hot to live , if you ask me . You wo n't go up ? " " She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will . Perhaps I can make her believe it , though she 's terrible jittery . " She dropped her spectacles by the band and drew her right hand across her wet eyes . " When I saw that child lyin ' there so still , though I knew he had nothin ' to do with it , I could have choked that Kenniston Stewart with my bare hands . " " Sarah Ann Parker , that goes for me too ? and double . Better hustle up a lunch for Cindy . She 'll be gay as a lark after she eats . So long . " " Queer things are being seen and heard in this neighborhood , " Harding 's voice echoed through his memory as he crossed the patio to his car . Sary was suspicious of the Foster girl 's reason for surreptitiously entering the kitchen a few moments ago . " Folks say , she 's runnin ' round with a toughlookin ' man who 's tryin ' to get a job at one of the summer places . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand looking into .  | She was employed as parlormaid by the owner of the yacht which dropped anchor often off the Rockledge shore . Did these facts tie together ? Had Ally Barclay missed a trick when she decided that " the rich businesswoman , " Mrs. Drew , was above suspicion ?  | GAME and set for us , Cinderella , I hope we can add match ' tomorrow . We knocked Lydia Fane and that boy she is running round with out of the tournament . Not that he is n't tops . I bet he 's champ material . He has a volley that will take him places . Jupiter , Maine sea breezes have burned my Western skin to a crisp . " Tom Slade tenderly touched his bright scarlet cheek before he tucked his arm under hers . " Let 's go somewhere for lunch . " " Not today . Thomas , you are everlastingly wanting to go ' somewhere . Do n't you ever sit still and reflect on world problems or the beauties of nature ? " " I 'm reflecting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light blue cardigan , this minute . Sure I reflect on world problems , how can one help it if one reads of the menace of the cold war and the unrest simmering beneath the thin shell of diplomacy ? But not when I am on vacation visiting my girl . Do n't stiffen . I 'm done . What a day . All green and gold and blue and a breeze straight from the ocean . Sniff the salt . " " And is the coolness appreciated after the wilting heat of yesterday ? The Stars and Stripes and the Club pennant are standing out straight . " " Did you get the oil deal tied up ? " " We did . " " Did it take you all day to do it ? I called at The Castle  | soon after lunch , rang and rang . When I phoned in the eve . ring that watchdog of yours said you 'd had a hard day and had gone to bed . " " Sarah Ann Parker told you that ? At about three I looked in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " evidently the news of her sleep-fest had not reached the air waves ? " I went home and found Mrs. Barclay there , making a formal call , she is Counselor Armstrong 's sister , in case you care , and accepted her invitation for buffet supper and an evening at Canasta with her brother and herself . " Had Bill Damon prompted the invitation ? The two exciting games had been just what she needed to restore her self-confidence . The sudden sleep had frightened her . " Who made the fourth ? " " I object to the hint of suspicion in the question . Three can play . Of course you do n't play partners , but it is lots of fun . " " Do you like Mrs. Barclay ? " " Very much . She is charming . A glowing sort of person , i f you get what I mean . " " Sure I get what you mean , that 's the sort of person you IP are . You give out something , friendliness and interest , that makes the other fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom Slade . That is the loveliest thing ever said to me . " " Do n't let it turn your head . Lyd Fane says she thinks the ruddy Armstrong has views about you . " " What does she mean , ' views ' ? " " The next Mrs. Armstrong . Guess telling you that was a mistake . May get your hopes up . " " Now who is kidding ? Thomas , when , if ever , I get out 1 ) f the present matrimonial quicksands it will be many a day before I am drawn into one again . "  | " Is that so ? Let 's tune in on another station . I sure am sold on your Maine coast . When I have made an immortal reputation as a jurist and incidentally , my pile , I 'll buy a place in this town and raise strawberries . I 've never yet had my fill of big luscious ones . Would that suit you , Cinder-ella ? " " Like the girl in Mother Goose who sat on a cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar and cream ? No thank you . The prospect leaves me cold . " " Wrong number . I 'll try again . Darn it , here comes the Fane menace . Wonder if she 's sore because we beat her ? " " No . Whatever Lyd 's faults , she 's a good sport . She 's had a curious life , parents separated , each has had two additional marriages . She spent several years abroad , Ella Crane says with a fast set . ' " " She may have had a curious life , but she remains a pest , " Slade muttered . " You 'll come to the Bal Masque at the Inn next week Friday night , wo n't you , Tommy ?

You gals all but mobbed that Damon fella when he came out to get into his car this A.M. You had no eyes for me sitting on the porch rail . " " Do n't be touchy , Tommy . We are all crazy about you , " Lydia cooed , " but there is an unwritten law that we ca n't  | cut in on another girl 's beau . " The expression in the green eyes as they flashed to hers brought color to Cindy 's face . She means Tom is mine , she thought . " To return to Bill Damon ; did you see him beat Tod Currier a few minutes ago ? Our returned hero will draw a crowd tomorrow when he appears for the finals . This morning we were trying to sell him on the Bal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He promised to take tickets . Whether he came would depend upon what he could think up for a costume . There is a rumor that he is at the Inn to be near his heartbeat . " Where did she pick up that gossip , Cindy wondered . Should she tell her the real reason for his presence in this village , that he had come to clear up Kenniston Stewart 's business , matrimonial and otherwise ? Lydia would love to broadcast that morsel . " The plot thickens , " Torn Slade declared dramatically . " Which gal at the Inn is his heartbeat ? " Above the light he was holding to a cigarette he winked at Cindy . " It is n't one of us girls , worse luck . The other night Alida Barclay , Lady Barclay to you , was his guest at dinner . I 'll hand it to her for having clothes sense . Fashion firsts from haircut to shoes . She looked as a Duchess should and rarely does . A little bird chirped that they sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near together , watching the moon . " " Which one of the Inn young ladies put on the espionage act ? Too bad there were n't wires to tap . " " Cut the sarcasm , Tommy . We were not snooping . We sent several emissaries to invite them to join us at cards , hut they were so absorbed in one another that no one dared break in. " 71  | " Mighty considerate of the messengers not to disturb love 's young dream . " " Young dream ? " Lydia 's laugh was a shriek of derision . " Alida Barclay must be at least ten years older than Bill Damon . " " What 's ten years when Love is at the helm ? " Cindy was shocked at the edge in her own voice . " If you ask me , dearie , ten years is twenty when it is on the woman 's side . Are n't you two coming in for a cold drink ? " Lydia Fane 's question flagged Cindy 's train of thought to an abrupt stop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home to change my tennis clothes for something chic and elegant , after which I shall call on Mrs. Sally Drew at Rockledge . I hear she complains that the cottagers have ignored her . Come with me ? " " I 'm not a cottager , that lets me out . Someone ought to tell her that blonde bleach may be a lifesaver , but when it turns hair the color of the brass rings at a merry-go-round , it shoots her into a different class . I 'd go , though , if I thought her secretary ' ? interrogation point ? would be among those present . I 'm told he 's blond as a Viking , has a **30;620;TOOLONG manner and lives on her yacht .

" If that gal belonged to me I 'd wring her lovely neck and wring it hard . Though she did n't mention it , I bet she was getting back at us with her wisecracks for knocking her out of the tournament .

What 's the idea ? A period of mourning for Kenniston Stewart ? At least you 'll let me come to The Castle and hold your hand ? " " I 'm disappointed in you , Thomas . I thought you would understand . You do n't . You are as uncomprehending as Hal Harding . " " Did that playboy suggest whoopee ? " " He did . If you really want to help take me to call on Mrs. Sally Drew this afternoon in your snappy Town and Country convertible .

They told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play off my semifinals in the men 's doubles this afternoon . Terribly sorry . Here comes Ken Stewart 's stand-in . He 'll take you . Hi , Damon ! " The man with the crimson cardigan thrown across the shoulders of his short-sleeved , open-neck white shirt waved his racquet in response to the hail and joined them . " Did I hear my name ? You and Slade played a corking game , Cindy . " " Thank the gentleman like a little lady , then speak your piece and say Please ' prettily , Cinderella . " " She does n't have to say Please ' prettily . What can I do for you , Cindy ? " Bill Damon 's voice sounded grave in contrast to Slade 's light banter . " I have planned to call on Mrs. Sally Drew at Rockledge  | this afternoon , gloves , visiting card and all the sodal frills . My jalopy is unreliable , of course I could go across the cove in my Evinrude , The Mighty Mo , but I 'm trying to engage a chauffeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's what I 'm here for .

" Not any better than from The Castle , " Cindy reminded jealously . " Righto . Would it be in poor taste for your chauffeur to tell you that you are a knockout in that white frock , matching gloves , and big velvet hat ? What 's the color ? " " Coral orange . " " It 's perfect on you . Did you have the corsage of sweet peas dyed to match ? What does it say on those cards in the silver case ? " " I 'm making it formal today . " She was annoyingly aware that her color deepened . " I ca n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name yet . Counselor Armstrong phoned me that the annulment case will be called and settled tomorrow afternoon . " " He notified me also . What do we do next ? Are we to sit here admiring the view ? and you ? or are you going in ? " She laughed . " In , Colonel Damon . " He stood beside the car as she stepped to the porch .  | " I 'll wait till we find out if the lady is at home . If she is , I 'll drive around and come back . " " Return in twenty minutes ? please . Do n't make it a second longer than that . " He touched his soft hat . " In twenty minutes , Mrs. Stewart . "  | MRS . STEWART . " Bill Damon had called her by that name before , but for some unexplained reason this time Cindy 's heartbeat quickened . She lifted the shining brass knocker and let it drop . The sound echoed inside the house like the knell of doom . She straightened the coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the door was opened . " Is Mrs. Drew at home ? " At the moment she asked the question she recognized the maid in smart white uniform and scrap of cap as the girl in the red swim outfit who had been returning the glances of the man in the black and white checked suit with interest . She must be Rena Foster , whom Sarah Ann Parker had declared was a " flighty piece . " Now her eyes were coldly defiant . Did she recognize the caller as the person who had snapped her picture ? " She is , Madam . Wo n't you come in ? " " Tell her that Mrs. Stewart from The Castle is calling . " She entered the house and followed the maid through a hall to the threshold of a room that blazed with color . With a murmured word the girl departed . I 've read that color and bright light kindle the flame of the human spirit , the spirit of the occupant of this house ought to glow like a thousand-watt incandescent bulb , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloss . Her heels clicked sharply . 11  | A woman in white from head to feet , standing close to the bleached maple wall with one hand touching it as if experimentally , turned quickly . " Cindy Clinton ! You gave me the start of my life . " Alida Barclay 's voice was gay if a trifle breathless . " Are n't the walls of this room beautiful ? So sensible not to clutter them with pictures , mirrors or hangings . I was wondering if this maple would be practicable to use in my living room in New York . " " I like the spaciousness and color , " Cindy approved . " It must be the last word in mid-twentieth-century decoration to harmonize with the architecture of the house . " A low couch was cushioned in the soft pink of the blossoms of a huge geranium in an Oriental lacquer stand in a corner ; its pillows were the lightest shade of the green of the leaves . A flat dark blue bowl on a broad desk of natural mahogany held one mammoth pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqua ; a mass of auratum lilies topped a low black and gold cabinet . Tables at the arm of inviting chairs holding choice figurines or bronzes were reflected in the polished floor like colorful islands in a still pool . A Ming vase lamp at each end of the couch threw a soft pink light . Through the windows of the glassed-in extension of the living room was visible a vast expanse of sky and ocean . Alida Barclay laughed softly . " You appear to be considering a place to sit , Cindy . It must take a person with the spring of a gazelle to get out of the low chairs gracefully . These furnishings are as contemporary as flying saucers and the reduction of excise taxes . " She glanced at her wrist watch . " I 've been waiting ten minutes . My hostess left me to  | answer a long-distance call . I ca n't wait any longer . I 'm giving a little dinner for Mrs. Drew . The only date on which we could agree is next Thursday , the evening before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tucker ? I understand the lady thinks we natives , ' quote , are provincial ? and bring that good-looking Slade slave of yours . I 'll phone details . Explain to Mrs. Drew for me , will you ? " Alone in the vast room Cindy felt like Robinson Crusoe on a desert island with no man Friday in sight . But ? here he comes , she thought , as a yellow-haired , dark-eyed woman in a smart beige frock entered followed by a tall fair-haired man . The secretary , " blond as a Viking , " Cindy decided and disciplined the smile the echo of Lyd Fane 's words had started . " Mrs. Stewart , how sweet of you to come . " Thirty ? Forty ? The figures flashed through Cindy 's mind as she laid hers in the hand blazing with rings outheld in welcome . Better settle for early thirty . The man behind her hostess stood as if waiting to be included in the group . His fair skin did n't look as if he spent much time on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm in luck to find you at home , Mrs. Drew . " " I 'm the person who is in luck , Mrs. Stewart . " She glanced around the room . " What became of that sweet Mrs. Barclay ? I had to leave to answer a long-distance call . " Cindy explained . " I am consumed with mortification that it happened . Do sit down . Laurie , I had completely forgotten you . Mrs. Stewart , may I present Laurence Lloyd ? " " You 've heard of the forgotten man , Mrs. Stewart . Be hold him . " His blue eyes smiled into hers . Now I know idyl what Lyd meant by his **31;652;TOOLONG 11 1 ' ' 1  | manner , she thought before he added , " Your fame and your romantic story have preceded you . I have been hoping that we might meet . Sally , are we supposed to stand the rest of the afternoon ? " " Remember , Laurie , you are employed here . You are not the host , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snap , Cindy thought . He looks too big and husky to take that lying down . Is he afraid of her ? He laughed . Apparently he was n't . " That puts me in my place and how . " " Stop your nonsense , Laurie . Do sit down , Mrs. Stewart . I have ordered tea . " Cindy selected the geranium-pink couch as the seat least likely to force her knees under her chin . I 'll never be able to rise . Here 's hoping I wo n't have occasion to spring lightly to my feet . I could n't make it , she told herself as she settled deeper into the cushions . Mrs. Drew sank down gracefully beside her . The secretary selected a low chair . His long legs bent sharply at the knees reminded Cindy of a grasshopper 's . " As to being lucky to find me here , " the hostess had returned to Cindy 's greeting , " I 'm rarely anywhere but at home . " Her mouth took on a sorry-for-myself droop at the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and bright light kindled the flame of the human spirit has n't polled this spirit , Cindy concluded . " The wilting weather of the past few days has made home seem tlN best , " she contributed aloud and thought , Is that the top gem of conversation I can produce ? She tried again . " I ca n't feel sorry for you , Mrs. Drew , with that beautiful yacht in which to escape . I hope rumor is reliable in this case and that it is hers , she added to herself . " Escape ? What do you mean , escape ? "  | So what ? You 're frightened , lady . Was Sary right when she hinted there was a mystery connected with the coming and going of that boat ? Had the woman a spotty past or a smudged present ? Was she so shrewd as to be dangerous or so dull as to be dumb ? " Mrs. Stewart meant to escape the heat , of course , Sally . " Her master 's voice , Cindy thought , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reminder . " Here comes our tea , at last , " she announced . He moved a low table in front of her and the maid placed on it a mammoth black lacquer tray with Oriental eggshell cups and saucers , and gleaming silver . Mrs. Drew made the usual inquiries about her guest 's preferences as to strength and trimmings . The maid passed hot mushroom canapes and one-bite frosted cakes which Cindy recognized as carbon copies of Sarah Ann Parker 's master creations . " So sorry about that sweet Mrs. Barclay . " The hostess had returned to the subject of her recent caller . " She 's charming . Do tell me a little about her . Just what is her position in this town ? " " Do you mean her family ? It 's tops . She was born here , makes her home in New York , I believe . At present she is visiting her brother who is one of the most distinguished lawyers to come out of the State of Maine . " " Her face worries me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That is because she looked like a fashion model , Sally , " Lloyd interrupted . He had a curious habit of pinching the lobe of his left ear as he talked . Had he been afraid of what she might say ? " You 've seen her in duplicate in your favorite fashion magazines . "  | " It 's more than that . I have a feeling I have run across her somewhere . I 've been almost everywhere abroad except the Orient . Has Mrs. Barclay ever lived in Europe , Mrs. Stewart ? " " I do n't know , Mrs. Drew . I have n't seen or heard of her for years before this summer . " That did n't tell much . Cindy had a quick close-up of Alida Barclay 's outstretched hand feeling of the wall of this room . Mrs. Drew recalled her attention with a rapid-fire series of questions about guests at the Inn ; summer residents ; was there a putting green ? she adored putting ; on and on . Trifles that meant nothing to her , Cindy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in the Information Please quiz , she picked up her long gloves , rose , she hoped gracefully , from the geranium-pink couch . " The tea was delicious , " she declared to her hostess , who had extricated herself from the deep cushions with feline ease and grace . " You said you loved to putt . I 'll plan soon for you to try the green at The Castle . Good afternoon , Mr. Lloyd . " " Not yet . I 'll speed the parting guest . " Bill Damon , hatless , was standing beside the convertible when they stepped to the porch . He looked up . There was an instant of what seemed to Cindy an electrically charged silence . Were the two men enemies ? She hastened to break the spell . " Mr. Lloyd , Colonel Damon . " They bowed formally . " I hope you 'll come again and often ? Mrs. Stewart , " Lloyd said as he came down the one step as if to assist her into the car . Damon stepped between them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd , she invited from her seat beside the wheel . " Bring Mrs.  | Drew . Good- " The car shot ahead and left the rest of the word floating in thin air . " You did n't give me a chance to finish my pretty speech , " Cindy reminded . " What was the matter ? Did n't you like the blond Viking ? " " Like him ? Who is he ? " " He is Mrs. Drew 's secretary and lives on the yacht . Ella Crane announcing . I suspected by the way you two glared at one another that in a previous incarnation you had been mortal enemies . " " What did you say his name was ? I did n't get it . " " Laurence Lloyd . His employer calls him Laurie . ' " " Never heard the name before , that explodes your previousincarnation theory . " Cindy looked back at the spreading house . " Rockledge is full of beautiful Oriental pieces . I wonder i f they belong to the owner or the present tenant . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not wine . " " Perhaps Mrs. Drew has lived in the Orient ? " " During the conversation she volunteered the information that she had been almost everywhere abroad except there . " What led up to that statement ? " " Alida Barclay was calling when I arrived . After she left Mrs. Drew confided that Mrs. Barclay 's face worried her , she was sure she had met her before . " " Was ? did you say the name was Lloyd ? present when she said that ? " " Yes . He suggested that Mrs. Drew probably had seen her in duplicate in fashion magazines , as she was the perfect model of a smartly dressed woman . " " An orchid for Alida Barclay , I 'd say . Too bad she did n't  | hear it . " He glanced at her hand . " What 's the ring on your left third finger ? " " What would it be ? " " I thought you did n't wear a wedding ring . " " I wore it today to back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Drew called me Mrs. Stewart . I was horribly tempted to add , until tomorrow . If I had n't worn the ring what would she have thought ? That was a rhetorical question . You need n't answer . " She moved the diamond circlet up and down . " It is beautiful , but a plain gold band , not too wide , is my idea of a wedding ring . Perhaps because for years I saw one like that on Mother 's finger . " " You do n't like anything that is in any way connected with Kenniston Stewart , do you ? " " Let me think . I like his name . " " You 're terribly unfair to him , Cindy . He could n't come ? " " If I am my feelings about him wo n't make any difference after today . I know I am unfair to him , and I burn with shame after I 've criticized him , but you ca n't understand , I do n't myself , the restless , contradictory emotions fighting for control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions does its part toward the tumult , I suppose . " " Does that mean you doubt the wisdom of the annulment , Cinderella ? " " No . No . How can I doubt it ? Kenniston Stewart is as keen for his freedom as I am , is n't he ? How did we get switched to my problems ? Let 's tune in on another station . I was thinking the other day ? you know my life story from the cradle on , I do n't know who you are , where you TO LOVE AND TO HONOR I2I  | came from , except that you are a pal of Ken Stewart 's . You may be married . Your past is a blank to me . " " It is n't a blank to me , Cinderella . It has been redly and indelibly recorded on the screen of memory . When I 'm through with Ken Stewart 's commission , I 'll give you a decade-by-decade account of my life , starting back with the areer of my maternal great-grandfather , who made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure funds . I 'll confide my ambition to be an honored citizen who counts in the welfare of this nation while I climb to the top of my profession . " He laughed . " Think you can take it ? " " Yes . I like the word honored . ' " To love and to honor , the phrase which Hal had criticized , flashed through her mind . Bill Damon would have understood . " Did ? did Counselor Armstrong notify you that the annulment case was set for tomorrow afternoon ? " " Yes . " " Will you be there ? " " I ? Certainly not . As soon as I 've played off my doubles I have a business appointment in Portland . " Conversation lagged after that . Cindy was afraid to speak fur fear her voice would show her disappointment . She had had the foolish hope that he would see her through the hearing . At the door of The Castle , he said , " Good luck tomorrow . Good-by , **30;685;TOOLONG . ' " As Cindy entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go where you are ? " The song ceased abruptly . Sarah Ann Parker appeared at the door of the old kitchen . " Is n't Mr. Damon comin ' in to have dinner with you ?  | Thought perhaps he would to talk over your case comin ' up tomorrow . Is he plannin ' to be there ? " " He is n't supposed to be present . This is an uncontested case , remember . I 'd like my dinner in the patio , Sary . " She went slowly up the stairs with a curious let-down feeling . " Why should n't he go off on business tomorrow ? " she demanded of the girl who faced her in the long mirror of her room . This annulment is nothing in his life . He did n't answer when I said , " You may be married . " Probably he is . She pulled off the coral orange velvet hat , unfastened the corsage of matching sweet peas , and brushed her hand across her eyes to clear them of tears . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from below . Sarah had switched on the radio .  | THERE WAS a gray-haired man in a black robe seated at a desk in the County Courthouse . On the wall above his head spread the Stars and Stripes . The sight of the flag stiffened Cindy 's knees . Time she stopped feeling as if she were committing a crime . Perhaps after today the turmoil of her spirit would settle down . Perhaps in time the written contract marriage would seem as remote as if it had happened in a dream . The Judge 's shaggy brows drew together in an appraising frown as the keen eyes under them met hers . Armstrong beside her inflated and deflated his cheeks . " Mrs. Cinderella Clinton Stewart , Your Honor . Judge Shelton , Mrs. Stewart . " The man at the desk rose , reached across to offer his hand and smiled . " I do n't need an introduction to little Cindy Clinton . I used to see you when I played chess with your father before he became a celebrated inventor and I hung out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-beaters . Sit here . " Ike indicated a chair beside the desk . " Ready , Counselor. " leis voice had changed from friendliness to gravity as befitted the business before him . She watched Armstrong step forward and spread papers on the desk without really seeing him . For one instant the friendliness of His Honor tempted her to ask if he approved  | of this annulment . That was a cockeyed thought . What difference would his opinion make ? Kenniston Stewart 's life and hers were to be considered . Was n't the defendant ? he was n't a defendant , he was a non-contestant ? clamoring for his . freedom . Another perfect day . A breeze drifting in through an open window brought the faint scent of autumn . Was that silly wasp crawling up the screen and sliding down trying to escape into the outside world ? Did each living creature who came into this room in the Courthouse want out ? " Have you no respect for the inviolability of a contract ? " Bill Damon had asked . Why had n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean with the declared intention of freeing him from that same contract ? Now she was being irrational . Why should he try to influence either of the parties involved ? " You are quite sure you want this marriage by written contract annulled , Cinderella ? " The dark eyes peering at her over the rims of the Judge 's spectacles were as grave as his voice . He was questioning her as he might a daughter ; his was the role of a friendly adviser , not that of the strong arm of the law . " Yes , Your Honor . " " I understand you never have seen Kenniston Stewart . " " That 's right , sir . " More questions , more answers . Why did he repeat questions the answers to which he knew from her lawyer 's presentation of the case ? It seemed as if she had been sitting beside the desk for hours . The breeze had wandered away . The amethyst cotton frock with the stem of a blush-pink dahlia drawn through the belt began to feel wilted . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear that if she  | appeared in the Judge 's chambers without her head covered she might be fined for contempt of court . " That 's all , Cinderella Clinton . " She rose as he came from behind the desk with hand extended . " Is that really my name again ? " " It is . Counselor Armstrong will file all necessary papers and send duplicates to Kenniston Stewart . You are as free as if you never had signed that contract . Legally your marriage is held not to have existed . Consider yourself a single girl . You may marry again as soon as you like . " " Marry ! No . No . You understand , do n't you , Judge Shelton , that I did n't ask for this annulment because I was in love with anyone , anyone on earth . " " I understand , Cinderella . If I had had doubts the blazing sincerity of your eyes and voice would have convinced me . I had that in mind when I granted the annulment quickly , that and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So many seek a court in another state to hasten a divorce in violation of the laws of their own state . Each state retains the power to regulate marriage and divorce . You were well advised . " She was thinking of his words as she stepped into her ancient jalopy in the Courthouse parking space . Sounded like an oft-rehearsed little speech to be delivered after each divorce . Now what ? Thank heaven there was no indication she would be rendered hors de combat by sleep at this milestone in her life as she had been when the responsibility of the oil holdings had been lifted from her shoulders . What a curious experience ! Lucky she had been with Bill Damon who understood . Sary had relayed his explanation . It had been so believable that her fright had been assuaged . He had n't  | mentioned it yesterday while they were together . Was it really business that had called him to Portland this afternoon or had he wanted to side-step the hearing ? One ! Two ! Three ! Four ! A village clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage had been terminated that had taken such an interminable time and endless correspondence to contract . " Legally your marriage is held not to have existed . Consider yourself a single girl , " Judge Shelton had said . Why think of the past ? From this minute she was free to go forward . Where ? Too early to go home . Sary would be lying in wait to pounce with questions , to ply her with tea and toast as if she needed solace after a harrowing experience . On the contrary , it had been heart-warming , the Judge had been so friendly . Why sit here deliberating ? She would drive to the shop where she had left the films to be blown up . She had n't dared leave them with Ella Crane , who would have third-degreed her to find out why she wanted them enlarged , who the man and girl were . " Hey , Cindy ! Is it all over ? Are you free ? Now we can go places . " Hal Harding 's eager voice hailed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding 's light blue eyes were sparkling with triumph . " Not today . Move away , Hal . I do n't want company . " With a snort the jalopy leaped forward . " You 'll have company . I never give up w-h-a-t I w-a-n-t . " His shout of angry warning with its hint of threat drifted into a murmur as she gave the car all it had , which was n't so much , until she reached the highway . She slowed down .  | Glanced out the rear window . He was not following . Perhaps he realized how ridiculous he appeared standing in the Courthouse parking lot shouting after a departing car . An hour later she drove the jalopy into the garage at The Castle . It was a modern miracle that she had made the trip without a crack-up . All the way to the city and back she had relived the experiences of the last three years with I lal Harding 's " You 'll have company . I never give up what I want , " an obligato accompaniment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of a page . Now she would leave the past behind and begin a brandnew chapter . She stole into the house , successfully dodged Sarah Ann Parker , showered , changed to a sleeveless aqua organdy and fastened a pink Perfection rose to her shoulder . But when she sat down at the glass table in the patio , where a crystal plate piled with rosy balls of iced watermelon awaited her , Sarah swooped like an owl which had been watching for its rabbit prey . She continued to hover after she served a delicately roasted squab chicken , a flaky baked potato , outsize peas of a sweet and melting tenderness , a fluffy roll , and currant jelly red as a mammoth pigeon-blood ruby . " Who was the Judge ? " she inquired as she filled a hollowstem glass with a fruit juice combination sparkling as champagne , cold as a mountain spring . " Shelton ? The Federal Judge ? He 's a wise man , an ' an awful nice one . Want to know somethin ' ? He was terribly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went off an ' married Lord Barclay , folks never knew what happened . He 's an old bach , has a fine family place ? up Portland way . " She added Roquefort cheese  | dressing to slices of chilled avocado and sections of pink grapefruit on pale green lettuce . " Ire told you he played chess with your father ? Sure he played with him . I remember him coming to this house . " You seem surprised he was friendly . Why not ? That 's the way a Judge should be to folks who bring their troubles to court , not scare ' em to death . " Did he lambast that Kenniston Stewart for not being here to appear before him ? " The question accompanied the serving of an individual baked Alaska , its meringue a delicate brown above vanilla ice cream . " He did n't ? Want to know somethin ' ? If I 'd been that judge I 'd have said a scorching thing or two . " And on and on until the ring of the telephone called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and another to accomplish the feat , Cindy decided later in the old kitchen with the pumpkin-yellow walls she used as a workroom . She drew ledger and account book from the drawer of a flat mahogany desk , the only modern piece of furniture among priceless antiques , and laid them on top . Hands clasped behind her head she leaned back in the swivel chair . Nice room . The mulberry borders and black centers of the Canova platter , tea and dinner plates on the shelves of the open cupboard were in charming contrast to the walls . They made an effective bit of color . Allah be praised , Sary would n't follow her here . The Woman at Work sign hung on the knob outside the door and even she , whom nothing fazed , would Stop ! Look ! Listen ! when she saw that . The sight of the books she had laid on the desk in preparation for the evening 's work induced a slight attack of nausea . Was it possible that after the final tax return was finished  | she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , too . Then what would she do ? Something definite . Something worth while . I will decide what I want most , plan for it and go after it with all there is in me . Bill Damon has the right idea , I want to be an honored citizen who counts in the welfare of the nation . I harangued Hal Harding as to the responsibility of wealth . Now it is up to me to prove I can practice what I preach . She glanced at the six silver tennis trophy cups on the high shelf above the old oven . She had worked to win those . She had been up against amateurs who later had ranked among the best players in the country . The dated , autographed golf balls in the glass case on the wall she had won putting . Yesterday she had invited Mrs. Drew to use The Castle green . The more she had thought of the woman since the call the less she liked her . Something artificial about her , ' night be her hair , undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color of her almost black eyes . She was pretty ? in a way ? but prissy . The word described her manner perfectly . Was she really the silent partner in a big cosmetic company ? Did that explain her need of a " secretary " ? Or was the man Laurence Lloyd there for a different reason ? In spite of her snap at him she was a little afraid of him . Why had Alida Barclay pressed her fingers against the wall in the Rockledge living room ? She jumped when I entered as if she had been caught stealing sheep . Her explanation that she was considering having a wall in her New York apartment done in bleached maple was a phony . Mrs. Drew was so sure she had seen or met her before , uneasily sure . Why ? Ally had planned a dinner for her .  | Would she entertain the woman if she thought she was an undesirable person in the community ? I 'd better stop speculating about my neighbors and tackle the accounting , but the neighbors are a heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ledger she saw the large envelope which contained the blown-up film she had dropped to the desk when she came home . She drew out the print . Tipped back in the swivel chair and studied it . Nice composition for an amateur . " Gal , you 're good , " she congratulated herself . The enlargement had been well done . The faces were recognizable , the girl was the maid who had served tea yesterday at Rockledge , her swim costume had come out a brilliant red . The green tie worn by the man and each black and white check of his suit stood out against the turquoise of the sky and the ultramarine ocean . A successful example of color photography if she said it who should n't . She held the print under the desk light . In spite of the low drawn hat brim each feature of his face was clear cut . Tough , as she had expected . He looked like a person who would ogle a strange girl at the beach . The bad-man tilt of his hat reminded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her throat and as suddenly grounded . It was like the hat of the person who had slipped out the rear door of the hall at The Castle the day she had met the bracelet man at Ella Crane 's shop . She had thought him a product of imagination then , now she knew he had been real . Why had he been in her house ? Why had he sneaked ? What was that ? The print she held fell to the floor as she sprang to her feet . Something was scratching at the outside of the priceless old painted shade she had drawn over the open window so the light of the room would not disclose the fact that she was within . A signal ? Who was it ? Tom  | Slade would n't intrude after she had told him she wanted to be alone . The sound again . " You 'll have company . " Hal Harding 's threat echoed through her memory . He was as unpredictable as he was persistent . " I 'll show him ? and how , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a force that sent it quivering on its roller . " Sarah Ann Parker would n't let me in , " explained a low voice from the gloom outside . " I had to see you . " A leg slid over the window sill . A man swung into the room . He reached to the tassel , pulled down the shade , and turned . " I have an important message to deliver , " declared Bill Damon .  | A MESSAGE ? From whom ? What did he mean ? Apprehensive of a crisis she backed away . " Of what are you afraid ? " He was smiling as he laid a large round white paper-covered box on the desk . " I 'm off to Washington tomorrow . Before I go I have a commission to carry out for Ken Stewart . I am considering the most tactful approach to the subject . " The desk stopped her retreat . A wave of color swept over her neck and face to her hair . " He did n't dare tell you to ? to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by ? What an imagination you have . Certainly not . Besides , when I kiss a girl I do n't post a notice . " The laughter in his eyes set even her ears burning . " Sit down , please . How can I talk to you when you appear to be figuring the distance to the door ? What 's this on the floor ? " He picked up the enlarged print . She explained , added : " Remember the morning we sat on the beach and I told you the tilt of the man 's hat was familiar ? You laughed and declared it was the Humphrey Bogart tilt to the fraction of an inch . I am sure now where I saw it . " " Where ? " She told of entering the hall the afternoon after she had  | met him in Ella Crane 's shop , of seeing the silhouette of a man at the other end , of his quick exit . " Sure you saw someone ? " " I am now , then I thought it was an imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smugglers and their hidden treasure . " He studied the print . " Sure this is the same guy ? " " I would n't go into court and swear it was he , with only the tilt of his hat as evidence , but the girl in the red swim suit who was with him at the beach was the maid who opened the door at Rockledge yesterday . " " That 's interesting . She dropped in while I was talking to Sary in the kitchen the day we signed the oil property deeds . Came to borrow eggs , she said . May I take this for twentyfour hours ? " " Keep it . I do n't want it . " " We have detoured from the assignment which brought me here , " he reminded as he slipped the print into the pocket of his bluish-gray coat . " Is it all over but the shouting ? " " If you mean the annulment , it is , " she succumbed to an impelling need to confide in someone , " but , curiously enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was free my spirit would soar on silver wings , instead of that , I ca n't seem to get it off the ground . Believe it or not , I feel as if I had lost something . " " It seems to me you had everything to gain . What had you to lose ? " " Perhaps it is the name . I always loved Mrs. Kenniston Stewart . ' " " Cindy ? " " I do n't need your shocked voice to remind me that  | I 'm a mass of contradictions . I do n't understand myself . " " Cindy ? " He cleared his voice . " Please sit down . " As she sat on the very edge of the swivel chair he perched on a corner of the flat desk . He drew an oblong violet velvet case from an inside pocket of his coat . " Ken hopes you will accept this as a slight token of appreciation of all you have done for him . Do n't draw back and stare as if you thought the thing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , I will . " He pressed a spring . The cover of the case flew up . She clasped her hands tight in thrilled surprise . " Oo-o-oh . How exquisite ! How lustrous ! The center pearls in the string are as big as the peas Sary served for dinner . The diamond clasp is superb . Are they ? they ca n't be real ? " " Sure they are real . Matched Orientals . You do n't think Stewart would offer you costume stuff after the way you have slaved for him , do you ? " " Mister , do n't sneer at costume stuff , it costs money . " She pushed away the hand that held the violet case . " Put them back in your pocket . I ca n't accept them . Have you forgotten that the marriage contract was annulled today ? " " Not for a minute . I waited till I was sure that had gone through before bringing the pearls so you would n't look upon them as a bribe . " " A bribe ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I repeat , I ca n't accept the gift . " " I do n't get you . Why ? First you sacrificed yourself in that marriage that the property might be held together ; you have kept Stewart 's accounts ; collected and deposited his income ; sent him monthly statements ; fought with the potential buyers of the oil holdings . What do you think the bill of a lawyer or a trust company would amount to for that serv- ice for three years plus ? He considered sending you a check , then felt he had sized you up well enough to be sure you would return it in shreds ; he thought of a ring ? " " I do n't want a ring from him . I have one which I intend to return . He does n't owe me anything . He advanced the money from a fortune he had inherited from his mother that his father and mine might acquire the property . Dad had only his inventions to put into the deal . Thank goodness every cent of our share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment for his financial help in the beginning . " " Even the marriage ? " " That too . Now he is getting all his principal back plus his freedom . " " He does n't take that view of what you have done for him . Accept the pearls and wear them . They are not a gift . They are inadequate payment for value received . " " Did Ken Stewart select them ? " " Sorry , he could n't leave his job . He asked me to buy pearls in New York . Hope the fact that he did n't make the selection wo n't detract from your pleasure in wearing them . Put them on . If they are hideously unbecoming he would n't want you to accept them . " " Unbecoming ! Did you ever know pearls to be unbecoming ? Hate those beautiful things ? Mon brave , you have missed your calling . You 're subtle . You should have been an advocate . I 'll wager you would win any case you argued . Hear that little crash ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead light . " Hold the case while I try them on . " Before a gilt-framed oval mirror between the windows she fastened the necklace . He laid the case on the desk before he  | came to stand behind her . She could see his reflection as he looked over her shoulder . " They glow on you . I wonder if the Prince gave the first Cinderella a gift so enormously becoming . " " Undoubtedly . Does n't the fairy story end and they lived happily ever after ' ? What woman could remain unhappy with pearls like these ? " " If only those pearls could insure your happiness forever , " he said gruffly . " Then I would n't be much of a person . I 'd be a restless , spineless creature with my soul and heart and thinking processes underdeveloped , if there were any , something tells me . " She moved her head from side to side and watched the effect . Her face flushed under the tan as she met his eyes in the mirror . " Like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . You 're terrific , lifted from your admirer Slade 's vocabulary . " " Where would I wear a superb necklace like this ? Certainly not here . " " You do n't expect to live here always , do you ? " " I do n't know where I will live . That 's one of my problems . " " Why not drift for a while ? You 've had your nose to the grindstone so long , make a play at being a free agent . The necklace is fully insured . Wear it . Do n't worry about the value . " " Deep in your heart do you think I should accept such a fabulous gift ? " " Deep in my heart I think you will be cruel if you do n't . Stewart is trying to show appreciation of an incalculable help you have been to him for which a money payment would be  | totally inadequate . I think you will be most ungracious if you do n't accept the gift in the spirit in which it is offered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervent Thank you ' when I send a report of this afternoon 's Court proceedings and his ring . " " Turn the ring over to me . It should be boxed and insured . I can take that off your shoulders . " " Thank you . " She unlocked a drawer in the desk and took out a white velvet case . " Here it is . Now the very last link in that marriage by contract is broken . " As he dropped the case into his pocket she tried to unclasp the necklace . " Let me do that . Why take it off ? I have been told that pearls should be worn night and day . " " You do n't know the difficulties of living with Sarah Ann Parker . " The touch of his fingers against her neck sent little tingles along her veins . He put the necklace in her hand . She returned to the desk and laid it tenderly in the violet case . " I need time in which to arrange my explanation as to why they were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every piece of jewelry I own . When I write Kenniston Stewart I 'll tell him he picked an irresistible advocate when he sent you . Why are you looking at me like that ? " " Like what ? " " As . I hope the next time I have a case to argue ? which something tells me will be the supreme effort of my life ? I will be as successful . I 'll write Ken that his gift pleased you . I forgot . " He handed her the white covered box . " Somewhat of a drop from pearls , but I thought you might enjoy a few chocolates from the big city . "  | " Chocolates ! " She ripped off the paper cover . " What a gorgeous box ! Wonderful ! I have n't had one from this super , super shop for years . You 've come across in a big way . Must be five pounds . Have one . " He shook his head . " I believe you are more pleased with the candy than with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as after careful inspection of the delectable assortment she selected a chocolate , and looked up at him from under the sweep of long lashes . " A huge box of candy has a romantic appeal . Silly , is n't it ? Besides , you thought of this yourself . You did n't ask anyone to do it for you . That 's one reason I love it . " " Ken Stewart thought of the pearls himself , " he reminded indignantly . " Yes , but he did n't take the trouble to select them . " " Want to know something ? I think you 're darned unfair . Good evening . I 'm off . " " Why the rush ? Mad with me ? " " When you smile in that beguiling way I could n't be . I have n't dined . While getting this important assignment off my mind I have been nobly concealing the pangs of starvation . Never try to detain a hungry man , Cinderella , his resistance is nil . Could be he might go a little mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind I 'll leave by the front door . I have a hunch that someone in a car without lights parked by the side of the road observed my clandestine entrance . We 'll make my exit regular . " He paused on the threshold . " Yesterday when you inquired as to my past , you said , You may be married . ' I 'm not . Good night . " Why had he suddenly remembered that he had n't answered  | my question ? she wondered . I 'm glad he is n't married . Now I can go all out in liking him . I 've had a curious feeling that I 'd better watch my step . I forgot to ask him if he is invited to Alida Barclay 's dinner for Mrs. Drew . He did n't wait to give me a chance to say " Good night . " The door closed with a bang . Nothing clandestine about that slam , it could be heard at the Inn . Is it he whistling with operatic fervor , " Some Enchanted Evening " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening till the sound trailed off in the direction of the garage . had he left his club coupe there ? Lights sprang on across the road . A parked car ? Had the entrance and exit of Bill Damon been watched ? Who would do it ? A vision of a man with a tilted hat brim caught at her breath .  | THE EIGHT tall vases of rose-pink glads , placed at an equal distance against the glass walls of the large porch which was an extension of the dining room at White Pillars , made a dramatic setting for the oval table with its choice lace , gleaming silver , gold-etched crystal , and gilt candelabra holding high eight tapers the exact color of the flowers in the background and the sweet peas in the low golden bowl in the center . Through an open window came a soft breeze , the heavy scent of stock and the damp earth of a garden . A dramatic setting for Mrs. Drew also , and she is making the most of it , Cindy thought , as from under long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seth Armstrong , who presided at one end of the table . Her hair , which Lyd had dubbed " brassy , " had been toned to the shade of golden honey , clipped and curved to the shape of the skull , then dipped at the sides in a winged effect . Her " doe " eye make-up lifting at the temples like the tip of a wing was nothing short of seductive , it accentuated the brilliance of her dark eyes . Her skin was smooth and colorless as a gardenia . The brilliant coral pink of her bow-shaped mouth was emphasized by a black beauty patch near one corner of her lips . Her white bodice glittering with opaline sequins ? what there was of it visible above the table ? lavishly , generously exposed neck , shoulders and arms , the left one glittering with diamond bracelets . Long chandelier pearl earrings which touched her A  | shoulders were the only other jewels except rings a trifle more glittering than her pointed coral-pink fingernails . " Hey , come out of the silence , Cindy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been staring at the guest of honor as if you 'd never seen a woman in evening dress before . " " Right on the nose , Thomas . I 've never seen quite so much of one before . She is lovely . Her hair-do is the most ravishing ever designed by the mind of man . " " I do n't like it as well as yours . Tonight you are looking like a million , lovely . " He turned to the woman in gun-metal satin seated at his right and Seth Armstrong 's left , her thin neck fenced in by a high dog collar of diamonds . " I beg pardon , did you speak to me , Madam ? " " I said , Hussy ! ' to anyone who would listen . " She pointed the word at the woman across the table . Tom Slade 's color already brilliant from sun and wind took on an added red . " Hold it , she 'll hear you , " he warned and turned to Cindy . " Brief me , quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is the Queen Mary twin at my right ? " " Counselor Armstrong 's Aunt Minerva , Min ' to her friends . Talk with her . She 's interesting . Knows the name of every senator and representative in Congress and from which state they hail . Writes letters to them when she disagrees with their policies . She 's an investment wizard also . The lady has views . " " You 're telling me . She 's agin the Circe who at the moment is bent on the enslavement of her nephew . She ? " " Young man , " a sharp voice at his right interrupted , stopping all other conversation at the table . " Pay proper respect to your elders . Stop talking to Cinderella Clinton . "  | " Cinderella Clinton ! " Mrs. Drew exclaimed . All eyes followed hers to Cindy 's flushing face . " Was Miss Armstrong referring to you , sugar ? Was the maid stupid when she announced you as Mrs. Stewart at Rockledge the other day ? " How maddening , I ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , can I ? Why did n't someone say something ? " Mrs. Drew , I 'm not an envious person , " Bill Damon was smiling engagingly at the woman at his left , " but , if I were to envy anyone I would you . I think your yacht is the slickest craft that comes into this harbor . You must be an expert to pick such a boat . " " Do you really , Colonel ? " Cindy was aware of the little sigh of relief that ran around the table as the guest of honor turned an expanse of beautiful naked back on her host and brought her whole battery of charm to bear on the man at her right . " Then perhaps you will sail with us sometime . " " I 'm all for it . " " I was brought up to believe that a sometime ' invitation amounted to a no-time ' invitation . I intend to nail you down to a date later in the evening , Colonel . " " Hmp ! I guess that did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose again . " Young man , someone mumbled your name , I did n't get it . " " Thomas Slade , Second . " " That sounds strong and reliable . Now , let Cindy talk to Judge Shelton , and pay attention to me . " " I 'd love to , Aunt Minerva , you see someone mumbled your name also . I hear you 're a stand-in for the Goddess of Wisdom . Bear with me if I seem shy . I 'm just a little Western lad unused to the effete East and its manners . You terrify me with your diamonds and dignity . "  | " Which part of the West ? " She chuckled . " Cowboy ? " Tom is safely off skiddy ground , Cindy thought and turned to answer a question of Judge Shelton at her left . " I have not made plans for the winter , Your I-Ionor . Just at present I 'm drifting and loving it . " The word drifting reminded her of Bill Damon 's advice . IIe was seated across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest of honor at his left he appeared to be absorbed in conversation with Lydia Fane at his right . Her eyes were as brilliant as her emeralds ; the off the shoulder line of her green frock was perhaps an inch higher than Mrs. Drew 's . She almost not quite snubbed Hal Ilarding who was sulking at her right . He was left high and deserted as a beached boat on a desert island when Ally Barclay at his other side was being monopolized by Judge Shelton . Delicious dinner , expert service , Cindy thought and wondered if the two wisteria-silk-uniformed maids were those Sary said had been brought from New York . A beautiful party , as far as color went , she qualified . The lovely glads in the background , Mrs. Drew in sparkling white ? if the scrap of costume showing denoted the remainder ; Lyd in brilliant green ; Ally Barclay in luscious mauve ; myself in bouffant nylon net the exact shade of the glads ; Aunt Min the minor chord in gray ; the men in white dinner jackets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The voice of the hostess derailed her train of thought . " Judge Shelton has to leave . Cinderella , will you pour for me while I speed the parting guest ? " Later Tom Slade came to the table at which Cindy was seated and took a slow , appraising look around the large room . He whistled softly .  | " The person who planned this decoration is an artist . The effect of French eighteenth-century paper panels set in bluegreen walls , silk hangings to match , is something to write home about . Where do you suppose they picked up all these fine old pieces of French furniture ? If the rug I 'm standing on is n't a priceless Aubusson , I 'll eat my hat . " " Spare your hat , Mr. Slade , it is . " Seth Armstrong confirmed his judgment . He held out a cup . " Coffee for Mrs. Drew , Cinderella . " As Tom Slade departed with a cup and saucer in each hand , he added , " I was sorry that our guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out with her . " " Thank you , Counselor . It took my breath for a minute . She came to The Castle last week for tea , I thought she knew then . Fortunately Colonel Damon rushed into the breach . " " Bill Damon coming up . " He set a cup on the tray in front of her as Seth Armstrong turned away from the table . " Black . This coffee is for Miss Fane , I 'm taking it to her after which I 'm coming back to tell you how lovely you are in that misty pink . " As he crossed the room Hal Harding took his place . " One cup . Black . Why did you call on the Drew menace after I advised you not to , Cindy ? " " I told you I intended to be neighborly . You said you had not met her . Now that you have , is she so terrible ? You 'll have to admit she 's a snappy dresser . " " She 's cheap . I wish you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite himself aboard her yacht . " " He dashed in to avert an explanation which would have been embarrassing . As I remember it , she invited him for a sail . " She looked up with a smile . " More coffee , Colonel ? "  | " I resent that more . ' The first cup was for Miss Fane . She told me you were getting a second for her , Harding . Better take it . The Counselor said that if there were no objections he would tune in on the broadcast Missing Persons . ' He explained that he is on the trail of a man who has skipped out with an important will and had asked the station to broadcast facts in the case . " " Sometimes I think that wills make more trouble than they prevent , " Harding growled and departed with two cups . " A large part of his fortune was tied up in a trust fund , " Cindy interpreted . " So I have heard . " Damon dropped two cubes of sugar into the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was tempted to tell the truth and answer , " Terribly , " but his nearness and the light in his eyes as he looked down into hers set her pulses tapping a warning , " Go slow . " She laughed . " Miss you ? Yes and no . I did n't have much chance to miss anyone . We had a lot of rain which turned the putting contest I planned for Mrs. Drew into a tea . Then I had my accounting to finish . As if that were not sufficient to keep me busy I had an acute attack of put-my-house-in-order , and cleared out slews of useless things . " " You have n't mentioned being with Slade during my absence . That put-my-house-in-order attack does n't mean that you are getting ready to go West with him , I hope . " Did the grave question mean that he would care if she did ? She rested her elbow on the lace-covered table , cupped her chin in hand and looked up at him . " Now that 's an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice . " Perhaps I 'd better mention it to Tom . "  | " You know you have the power to torment me and are reveling in it , are n't you , Cinderella ? Watch your step . I 'm not playing . Why did n't you wear your pearls ? " It took her an instant to rally to his quick change of subject . " I could n't stand up under what I knew would be Lyd Fane 's barrage of questions as to where they came from . I 'm getting soft . I ca n't take it . " " We shall have to come out with the truth about them later . They would have been perfect with the pink frock . I like the long stem and leaves of the rose tucked under the shoulder strap . I 've noticed that you never wear rings . I know why you did n't wear one . Do n't you like them ? " " Mad about them , big , sensational choice ones . I have n't any . All the family jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil wells . How they twisted your life . " " My life is n't twisted , " she denied indignantly . " I 'm on my toes with the thrill of being alive , free , I mean unencumbered by business cares . I 'm fairly tingling with Monte Cristo 's The world is mine ' spirit . Do n't you catch the vibrations ? " " I do . Something else , too . You are an exciting person , Cindy . May I take you home tonight ? I have a story to tell you and  --  here 's where I stoop to bribery ? a present for you . " " Another ? " " The pearls were from Ken Stewart . " " I was n't referring to those . I meant the chocolates . I love them . Sary and I have been on a candy binge . I adore presents but I ca n't fall for the bribe . And while we are on the subject , I do n't have to be bribed to go with you anywhere . " There was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were throwing herself into his arms . She laughed . " There 's a whole bunch of orchids for you , Sirrah . " " Think I do n't realize that ? " He cleared his gruff voice . " Why ca n't you fall for the bribe ? " " I came with Tom . I ca n't let him down . Did n't you bring Lydia ? " " At Mrs. Barclay 's request . She has turned me down for Harding . By the way , is he on calling terms with Mrs. Drew ? " " No . He had n't met her before this evening . " " Sure of that ? " " The morning you and he met for the first time and almost came to blows in the patio he said he had n't . Why ? " " Just wondering . They both spend so much time on the water seems as if they would have a lot in common . I remembered that you told me he gave you a detailed description of her yacht . " " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she owned it . " " I remember that also . Here comes the broadcast . Our host is sitting on the edge of his chair . " He stepped back to stand in front of the fireplace banked with ferns , set the cup and saucer on the marble mantel and lighted a cigarette . From her seat at the coffee table Cindy could see the occupants of the room in the gilt-framed pier mirror between the open windows where blue-green hangings swayed lightly in the sea breeze . It reflected Mrs. Drew in sparkling white seated on a Louis XV couch below a portrait of a lady in the costume of his court , languidly twirling a lace fan with mother-of-pearl sticks ; it gave back Tom Slade beside her ; the bulky host in a low chair near , leaning a little forward inflating and deflating his cheeks as he listened ; Lyd Fane ,  | a brilliant splash of green on a twin couch , Hal Harding holding a light to her cigarette ; the back of a tall , spare figure as Minerva Armstrong crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mauve frock on a low fauteuil beside the door . Cindy had been so absorbed in the mise en scene that she missed the opening of the broadcast . She was looking at Bill Damon 's mirrored reflection when she saw his brows draw together , saw him lean a little forward as if intent on what a voice was saying . She listened . " He had been AWOL for three years . Tired of dodging gave himself up at army headquarters . Explained that he deserted because he could n't stand being bossed by a woman , a WAC Captain . " Cindy heard Bill Damon 's soft chuckle . I 'll bet no woman could boss him , she thought as she looked up at him standing straight and tall before the mantel from which vantage he could see each person in the room , for all the world like a general reviewing passing troops . " The next case also has an army background , " the announcer went on , " though this time we are looking for a missing person . A Captain of Infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orient has reported the loss of his wife . " A sound drew Cindy 's eyes to the mirror . It reflected Hal Harding 's quick catch of Lyd Fane 's cup as it tilted dangerously ; gave back the spots of rouge on her white face as he set the saucer on a stand and whispered to her . Seth Armstrong glanced over his shoulder , muttered a low , annoyed " Ssshh . " At the sound Mrs. Drew looked up at Tom Slade , smiled , shrugged and with elaborate care closed the large lace fan she had been wielding .  | I hope I did n't miss the crux of the story , Cindy thought as she caught up with the voice : " Three years ago the wife sailed for this country to establish a home as the Captain expected to be sent back soon . She took furnishings and some valuable objects of art and jewels they had collected . He has received no word of her since . Orders were changed and he was kept abroad . Agents here have searched for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had planned to teach the game and earn money for their home . He still hopes to hear of a slender , darkhaired , extremely pretty woman , who because of amnesia does n't know who or where she is , whose nickname was Patty . " At the word amnesia Cindy looked up with startled eyes at Bill Damon , who was looking at her . He smiled and shook his head , as if he knew that for a frightened moment she had wondered if amnesia had caused that strange sleep the morning the oil property had been transferred . Seth Armstrong snapped off the radio . " Thanks for listening , " he said . " Did you get what you wanted , Counselor ? " his sister inquired . " No . " " Then we will start our contract . " Lydia Fane sprang to her feet . " I 'm all for it . Those missing persons reports give me the willies . Thank goodness my hair is red , my eyes are green , I 'm a rookie at bridge . I 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who does n't know where she is . No one will tap me on the shoulder and growl , Patty , you 're wanted . ' " There was a hint of hysteria in her voice . Cindy remem- bered that her face had whitened , she had almost dropped the cup and saucer she was holding when the announcer had spoken of the returned Captain of Infantry who had lost his wife . Lydia had lived abroad . Could it be possible ? " Do we cut for partners , Colonel ? " Sally Drew 's wistful voice broke in on her reflections . " Heaven help the person who draws me . He 'll slay me . I have n't played much bridge , and I have been told by an unfeeling critic that I have n't card sense . Now , who dares take me on ? " " I 'm your man , Mrs. Drew . I 'm distinctly in your class . We 'll play together , then the pot ca n't call the kettle black . " " Before we begin let 's make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and Mrs. Barclay and the Counselor . We 'll dine on board first . " " Sounds out of this world to me , Mrs. Drew . Here come our host and hostess to take us on . You can invite them now . "  | CINDERELLA stopped in the doorway of the white kitchen . Darius , the black Persian , rubbed his sleek body back and forth against her skirt to the accompaniment of a loud and rhythmic purr . " I 'm going to the turret room , Sary . " Sarah Ann Parker drew a delicately browned pie from the oven and set it on a trivet on the enamel table . Juice bubbled from the opening in the top crust and spread the delectable smell of baked apples , cinnamon and sugar . She sniffed . " Smells good , do n't it ? The Duchess apples , on the tree your father planted years ago , are just ready to use . No flavor like ' em . What you goin ' to the turret room for ? " " To select a costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that ? " " A masquerade party . " " Then why did n't you say so in plain English ? " " Do n't scowl , Sary . Remember one smile in the morning is worth two in the afternoon . Now there 's a line . It 's original , woman . " " Hmp ! " In spite of her disdainful sniff Sarah Ann Parker drew her right hand across her forehead as if to smooth out the frown . " You 're right on your toes this mornin ' , Cindy . Thought the other night at dinner after you came home from  | Court you was going to cry instead of being happy you were Cinderella Clinton again . You 've been kinder sober all this week , never knew rainy weather to depress you before . Guess you had a good time at Ally Barclay 's last evenin ' . You 're so perky now . Was the dinner nice ? " " Nice ! It was dee-licious , delectable . The filet mignon was done to perfection , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mere memory of them makes my mouth water . " She clasped her hands on her breast and rolled her eyes in ecstasy . " They were out of this world . " " Quit your play-acting , Cindy , and get down to earth . Was the New York cookin ' any better than mine ? " " No cooking could be better than yours , Sarah Ann Parker . Cross my heart an ' hope to die . " " I guess you 're kind of prejudiced , Cindy . " Sary attempted unsuccessfully to discipline a pleased grin . " I guess pickin ' apples in the sun was what made me scowl . What you countin ' on to wear at the party tonight ? Seems to me you 're pretty late getting a costume together . " " I have two ready to slip into . I went to several masquerades while I was in the West . The costumes I wore are in a chest in the turret room . I hope the moths have n't feasted on them . " " Moths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die of shame . Want to know somethin ' ? Last time I went through the trunks up there I come across that skating costume of your great-grandmother Clinton 's . Full bright red skirt with black velvet bands , an ' big pockets just like women are wearin ' today , and the cutest panties . White fur jacket ; cap , muff to match , even the skates are there . Looks just like new . Remember it ? " " I do . It 's a collector 's item . "  | " I do n't approve of masquerades an ' such goin 's on , Cindy , they can lead to a lot of deviltry . " " And a lot of fun , Sary . At midnight everyone unmasks , and ten to one the man you are with is n't the person you 1 hought or hoped he was . " " I still do n't believe in it . Get a lot of folks together with their faces covered up an ' how do you know who you 're dancin ' with ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be anxious about you every minute you 're gone . " " That 's a foolish fear , Sary . The committee which is selling tickets at five dollars per will do a little screening , I hope . l , yd Fane put on a great selling campaign at Ally Barclay 's dinner last night . Mrs. Sally Drew took five tickets , Judge Shelton five . " " That would be fifty dollars ! " " For the hospital , remember . What time lunch ? " " ' Bout an hour . Got a surprise for you . Something you like . Better put an apron over that light green linen dress . May be dusty in the turret room . " " Dusty in a house you have the care of ? You 're fishing for another compliment , woman . No , you ca n't come with me , Darius . I do n't want you . " " That cat loves you , Cindy , but he 's layin ' it on extra thick tryin ' to make me jealous because he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sary ? " " This morning when I opened the pat-i-o door , there were three field mice laid out nice as could be on the flaggin ' , an ' that cat stood looking up at me with a robin danglin ' from his mouth . I spanked him good . " " Darius the Persian king laying gifts at the feet of his queen . I hope he wo n't express his love for me that way ..  | I 'm off . If I do n't appear within an hour send up a rescue party . I may have cracked my head against a beam and been knocked senseless . After which cheery suggestion I will depart . " A few minutes later she read the tag on a chest pushed back under a window and dropped to her knees in front of it . Before she raised the cover she glanced out at the illimitable stretch of ocean ? had pirates sailed that sea , had they been in this very room , she asked herself . Nice old place . Clean as a whistle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and a little girl named Grace Temple had had playing with the big dollhouse in the corner . She never had dared come up here alone . She remembered how she had hurriedly shot the bolt on the outside of the door at the foot of the stairs when she heard weird creaks behind it as if someone were stealing softly down . She had been brought up on the story of the smugglers and their shuffling steps . Gay boxes held hats in which she and her small friends trailing their mothers ' long skirts had fared forth to call on the neighbors . An old-fashioned dressmaker form in front of the narrow door that opened on the secret stairs had an uncanny resemblance to a human watching her . Framed pictures , a motley score , were turned faces to the wall ; the head and foot boards of a spool bed leaned companionably close to a dark chintz-covered wing chair . Vases in infinite variety , plates , colorful dozens of them , vegetable dishes of her greatgrandmother 's set of Canova were loaded on an oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink rose at her collar gave her a start . Silly . It was her own reflection in the long gilt-framed pier mirror . Things . Things . Things . Too bad her put-my-house-in- order attack had n't started on this accumulation . She would tackle it next . She was the last of her family , there were no relatives to whom it would mean anything , but it ought to he of use to someone . I wo n't give away these costumes , she decided as she lifted the cover of the cedar chest . They represent too much fun and the fun one has had ca n't be snitched away , she philosophized as she held up a ragged dark blue denim work dress . She shook it and between the pendant rags glittered a frock of silver sequins . She remembered the night she had worn it , how at the stroke of twelve she had caught the tags of two zippers and with the prayer they would not fail her had dropped the dark blue garment to the floor . The lightning change from rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing it tonight ? No . Tom Slade had seen her in it , and Lyd Fane had wisecracked about shedding a glass slipper at midnight , apparently she was expecting a Cinderella costume ; also she had suggested that Ken Stewart might appear . Better push that thought out of her mind and quick . She drew out a fringed Indian costume , richly beaded . Pocahontas . No one had recognized her the night she wore it . This would be perfect . A white box held a wig and hairpins with which to adjust it . One red and one dark blue quill were thrust into the black hair at the left of the middle part ; two waist-length braids were tied at the ends with red and blue ribbons . She looped a half dozen strings of gay beads over her arm . " Seems to be something missing , " she mused aloud . " I remember . There were two broad copper bracelets not of the Pocahontas period , but effective . I 'll hunt in the chest for those . "  | She hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkles and perched the wig with its quills and long braids on top . On her knees in front of the chest she burrowed for the bracelets . Funny . They must be here . Darn ! Would she have to take out everything ? What in the world ? something that felt like a bag . When she packed the chest she had n't put in a bag ? or had she ? She had had so much on her mind at the time she might have forgotten . She would n't swear now that she had n't . She 'd swear she had n't packed this one , she told herself as with an effort she pulled up a grayish-white cotton bag so full of something that there had been little room for the stout twine tied round and round at the neck . Looked like a five-pound salt bag washed clean of printing . She sat on the floor , dropped it into her lap and regarded it curiously . Was it something the movie people had planted here last summer and forgotten ? They had photographed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones or pebbles . Icy fingers closed about her heart , chills feathered along her nerves . What was in it ? " Do n't sit here staring at the thing , open it , " she prodded herself . Her fingers worked at the hard knot till they were numb . At the imminent peril of loosening a tooth she tugged with her teeth till she could have cried from frustration . It must be opened . She would n't take it out of this room till she knew what was in it . If only she had a hairpin . The wig ! She laid the bag aside and tiptoed across to the dressmaker frame . Eureka ! Four hairpins and not the useless invisible ones either , they were of stout old-fashioned black wire .  | Back beside the chest , seated on the floor , legs outstretched , she attacked the knot . Had she started it ? A little . Another pry . That loosened it . One more ? it ? it was giving ? that last poke did it . She pulled off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came . The bag spread open quickly as if glad of the release . She looked into the gaping opening . Rubbed her left hand over her eyes . Looked again . This must be a dream . Those just could n't be jewels winking and sparkling up at her . Had sudden sleep overcome her again ? Mentally she backtracked : I stopped at the kitchen door ? told Sary I was coming up here ? I know that was real ? I could n't dream the delectable smell of that freshly baked apple pie . I came up the turret stairs . Opened the chest ? there 's Pocahontas , complete with wig and beads on the dressmaker form ? perhaps this will tell the story . She placed a finger between her teeth and extracted a twine splinter . Glory be , that hurt . Now I know I 'm awake , with a cache of jewels , real or fake ? She emptied the contents of the bag into her lap . A few brooches tumbled out , three sensational bracelets came after , too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rubies or sapphires , followed by a veritable cascade of unset precious stones . She stared at them incredulously . This was n't motionpicture stuff . The jewels were real as rain . Remindful of the value of fingerprints , with the bent hairpin she hooked up a ring with one huge diamond . Curious setting . For a guess it was Oriental and very old . Were these stolen jewels ? Where had they come from ? By whom had they been hidden in the chest ? Memory flashed a close-up . The tenuous shadow she had seen in the hall , the man with the turned-down hat brim ?  | Could be . He would n't leave them here indefinitely . He would come back . Should she hide them or ? " Cin  --  dy ! " Sarah Ann Parker 's voice , Sarah Ann Parker opening the door at the foot of the stairs . " Cindy , why do n't you come down ? Want I should come up and help you find things ? " " No , no , Sary . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm coming . I 'm just closing the ? the trunk . " She had almost said chest , which might reveal later where she had found the bag . " Did you find what you wanted , Cindy ? " " I did . Everything . I 'm bringing the things down to my room . Wait till you see me tonight ? I 'll knock your eyes out . Run along and serve lunch . I 'm starving . " " Want to know somethin ' , Cinderella Clinton ? You 're always starving . I do n't know how you keep thin as a wilier wand . You come along now , quick . " Cindy twisted the twine round the neck of the bag and considered . Should she leave it here and set a trap for the person who had hidden it or take it to her room and hide it ? Better take it and make sure it was n't retrieved by the thief . She closed the chest and with the bag gripped in her left hand stood up . Oooch , her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the spool bed ? Her heart stopped , thundered on . One of the jewels from her lap ? Ca n't stop to hunt for it . If I stay here longer Sary will be on my trail . How shall I get this hefty thing down ? I might meet her in the hall . My wardrobe case . I 'll tuck the jewels under Pocahontas . She opened the blue leather case marked C.C.S . and filled it . She looked back before she left the turret room in the hope of seeing the glitter of the missing jewel . With the sustain- ing thought that if it was n't visible to her no one else would see it she went down the stairs with the blue wardrobe case bumping against every step . Now what , she asked herself when she reached her room . I 'll leave this just as it is until after lunch . No one can possibly get in while Sary and I are downstairs . Some one had come in , she discovered as she opened the door to the patio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected him ? There was an extra place set . " I dropped in to return the enlarged snapshot I borrowed . I 've been on and off long distance to Washington the entire morning , " he explained . " Miss Parker invited me to stay for lobster salad ? plus apple pie . I might have resisted the first , but not the last . I do n't like your attitude of incredulous surprise , Miss Clinton . You make me feel like an intruder . " " Intruder . I would rather see you at this moment than any other person in the world . " The fervor of her declaration startled her and sent a dark wave of color under his bronze . " That 's a greeting one does n't get every day . " He cleared his husky voice . " I 'd like an explanation of it after lunch . I ca n't believe I owe it to my fatal charm . " " You 'll get the explanation if I can wait that long . " " Sit here . " He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitable child you are . " " Are you referring to the dynamics of my emotional conflicts ? I cribbed that from a psychiatrist 's report . " IIer light voice was a triumph of will over seething excitement . " I am glad to hear the laughter in your voice . You frightened me for a moment . " " How did you come out at contract with the fascinating Sally Drew last evening ? " she asked in the hope of quieting  | her tingling nerves by switching her thoughts from the jewels . " Did she call you sugar ' ? " " No . I heard her call you sugar . You said that Harding used that endearing word instead of your name several times . I wonder if he picked it up from her ? " " No , because that morning in the patio he declared he never had met the woman , did n't want to , objected when I said I planned to call on her . Tell me about the game . " " She was absorbed in her hand . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating rules recently learned . I had n't supposed that an intelligent woman ? and something tells me she is intelligent ? could be so dumb . " " I heard you tell her you were n't good . I do n't believe that . " " Goodness , like happiness , is a relative term , Cinderella . I was trying to give the lady courage , also to help my host and hostess . They are experts . Ally planned that we were to play with them . If Mrs. Drew were as new at the game as she claimed , no card sense , she said ? I thought that the Armstrongs ' evening would be ruined if one of them drew her as a partner . Miss Parker approaches with rolls that look light enough to have snowed down . " It seemed to Cindy that aeons passed before Sarah Ann Parker , who talked volubly while she served luncheon , mainly about the casualties of her favorite ball team , closed the patio door behind her . " What 's on your mind , Cindy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin to cross-examine you . " " Can what I say be overheard here ? " She looked behind her at the house , then across the putting green to the vast expanse of ocean . TO LOVE AND TO HONOR 161  | " Let 's go to the seat on the point . No one can overhear there . " " No . No , I do n't dare be so far away for fear ? " " Suppose we talk in your workroom ? With the door closed ? " " No , I could n't see the front stairs . Do n't look at me as if you suspected I am losing my mind . Wait till you hear ? " " Take it easy , darling . " " Do n't call me darling as if you thought me an invalid or an incompetent . " " That was n't the idea back of the word but we 'll take up that also some other time . I 'll sit at the table , smoke and keep my eyes on the house . You face me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting green . Let 's go . " To the accompaniment of the hum of bees dipping into the hearts of the colorful blossoms in the flower borders and the tinkle of the fountain spray dropping back into the pool , she told of her reason for the trip to the turret room , started to tell of taking out the Pocahontas costume , stopped abruptly . " Why the period ? " " I almost told what I plan to wear to the masquerade tonight . It would have spoiled the fun . I 'm sure no one will recognize me till we unmask . " " Want to bet on that ? " " I would be willing to . Let 's go back to my STORY in capital letters . " She talked in a low voice without interruption from him . When she finished she clasped her hands tightly on the table and leaned forward . " What shall I do ? " she whispered . " You left the bag of jewels in your room ? "  | " Yes . " He paced back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped beside her chair . She rose and laid her hand on his arm . " What shall I do ? " she repeated . " Put the bag back where you found it . " " Put it back ? Suppose ? suppose the person from whom it was stolen ? it must have been stolen , there 's no other explanation ? were to trace it to the turret room ? I would be accused of stealing it . " " I 'll look out for that . Go up now , quickly , and put the salt bag ? if it is a salt bag ? of jewels exactly where you found it and replace every article as it was when you opened the chest . " " If I do that I wo n't have anything to wear at the masquerade . What difference does that make ? I sha n't go . I wo n't leave the house until the mystery of that bag has been solved . " " You must go . You may give away the whole shootin ' - match if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be other clothes in the turret room you can wear . Repack the chest as it was , that 's vital . Step on it , Cindy . While you are upstairs I 'll engage Miss Parker in a baseball argument that will keep her occupied , I promise . " " I do n't understand why you want the jewels hidden again . I have n't had much experience in crime , but I think we should turn them over to the police . " " Then eight chances out of ten we 'd never find out who put them in that chest . " " Do you think we will now ? " She came close to whisper . " I 'm sure we will . " He bent his head and lightly kissed her parted lips . Straightened quickly . " You should n't tempt me , Miss Clinton . Hustle . Get the  | jewels back where you found them before anyone comes . Trust me , will you ? " " Trust you ? Did n't I tell you I 'd rather see you than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . I 'm going . " " I 'm sure we will , " Cindy repeated his words as she ran up the turret stairs . I have a feeling that Bill Damon suspects who hid them . How could he ? He does n't know anyone in this place . He appeared cool as a glacier , but ? she brushed her right hand across her lips ? I 'll bet underneath he was so excited he did n't realize he kissed me.  | THE WAITED till Cindy had had time to reach the turret room , then entered the kitchen . Sarah Ann Parker was at the open icebox . " That Colonel Damon is an awful nice person , Cindy . Kind of exciting like a movie actor , " she said without turning . " He has Hal Harding licked to a finish . I wish he was Ken Stewart . " " He is , Sary . " She whirled at the low assurance . The plate she held fell with a crash . She adjusted her spectacles hanging by the band and peered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth what 's the idea comin ' here under a false name ? " she demanded caustically . " Surprised you did n't wear a fake beard . " He gave her a tabloid version of his explanation to Alida Barclay . As she listened she became intent on collecting the casualty at her feet . " You wrote that letter to me , did n't you , Sarah Ann Parker , alias P.A.S. ? " he accused . She deposited the pieces of broken plate and its contents in the sink , pulled out a chair at a white enamel table which held a basket overflowing with green peas , and sank into it with a sigh . " You 've kinder taken the stiffenin ' out of my knees . I did write that letter . I sneaked the address from the envelope  | of one to you Cindy left to be mailed . Want to know somethin ' , I 'd do it again if I thought it would help keep her safe from that Hal Harding . This is the second summer he 's been courtin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's supportin ' , folks think he 's sidin ' with those men bein ' tried for treason . I laid awake lots of nights before I sent it wonderin ' if I was takin ' a chance at upsetting her life by doing it . " " It 's a ticklish business to play Fate , Sary . " " That 's what I kept tellin ' myself , I 'd think , suppose Kenniston Stewart came back because I sent that letter ; suppose he turned out to be a no-gooder who would pester her by remindin ' her she was married to him . I was scared for fear I 'd be like the woman Cindy told me ' bout one time , Pan someone , who opened a box she found on the seashore and let a whole flock of troubles out on the world . I sweat blood over that letter before I posted it . You 've been playin ' possum so long how come you 're out with the truth now ? " " Out with it only to you . I need your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you ? Have n't forgotten that that marriage do n't exist any more , have you ? " " No . No . Sit down again . Where did you pick up that crazy idea ? I need someone in this house whom I can trust . " " What 's goin ' on in this house ? " Her eyes were startled , her voice was shrill . " Ssh-sh . Not so loud . Can you keep a secret ? " " I 'm not Ella Crane who blabs everything she knows and a lot she does n't . You 'd be surprised if you knew the suspicions she 's started about you an ' why you 're here . " " What has she said ? " " Now I 've heard your story , what she 's been broadcasting 's nothing like the truth . I think Lyd Fane 's been connivin ' with her . She said when you were in her shop you  | spoke of a Sally an ' she 's kinder tying you up with the blonde who 's leased Rockledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard everything . I met the woman for the first time at the Armstrong dinner last evening . " " Ella do n't need facts to go on . She 's got imagination . Lots of folks like that . Want to know somethin ' ? I suspected who you were the day you phoned an ' said Bill Damon wanted to speak to Mrs. Stewart . Ca n't say I 'd been so smart if I had n't written that letter . The mornin ' you came to take Cindy to Trader Armstrong 's office I was sure  --  - then I was all at sea again when you let that annulment go through . Did n't seem as if a man after seeing Cindy would let her go . I 'm sorry , I guess the way your jaw set I 've blundered past a Keep Off ' sign . " " Let 's get back to open road . You 're not such a gay deceiver as you think , I 've had my suspicions that you knew who I am . " " Are n't you goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her last evening , but the right moment did n't come . She 's bound to resent the deception at first . I 'll make an opportunity after we unmask tonight . You wo n't betray me ? " " Not me . I interfered in her life and yours for the last time when I wrote that letter . " " Your promise takes a weight from my mind . We must talk and talk fast . Watch the garden and garage and I 'll keep my eyes on the hall door . I do n't want Cindy to hear . " " Terrible in love with her , are n't you ? " He ignored the emotional unsteadiness of her voice . " That road is posted No thoroughfare , ' too . " " You 're right . I do n't mean to be nosy , but I 've been so scared she 'd take up with that Hal Harding . She never let  | on but I could see she was dreadful hurt that Kenniston Stewart was n't interested enough in the girl he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , an ' when a girl 's pride is hurt there 's no accountin ' for what silly thing she 'll do . Hal has had most every woman in town in love with him off an ' on . I do n't mean anything sinful , but they kinder lost their heads ' bout him . I 'll admit that when he smiles at me an ' says , How are you , Sary Ann Parker , how 's the light of my life today ? ' I know perfectly well it 's just his foolin ' , but I feel a kinder glow . " " Thanks for the tip , Sary . " He laughed . " Now I know how to win friends and make love to a woman . Listen carefully . Cindy 's safety and yours are threatened . " " Sakes alive , your voice gives me the merry-pranks up an ' down my spine . What 's threatenin ' us ? " He told of the jewels Cindy had found in the chest in which her fancy dress costumes were stored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes bulged with unbelief , her cheeks burned red as her cotton dress . " I went through each trunk and chest in the turret room this spring when I opened The Castle . That bag was n't there then . How could a person get in an ' hide somethin ' in this house without me knowin ' it ? " " You do n't spend every moment of your life here , do you ? " " ' Course not , but I lock up tight as a drum when I go out . " He remembered the patio door which had opened so easily into the kitchen the day he had brought Cindy home , started to refer to it , abandoned the reminder as not being germane to the subject under discussion .  | " Do many strangers come to the house ? " " My sakes alive , there are always folks drivin ' up an ' askin ' to see the secret staircase ? " " I 've heard of the secret staircase . Where is it ? " " The cupboard side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a long flight of steps . " " Where do they lead ? " " To the turret room . Story is that when smugglers owned this place they hid up there . There was no other way to get there then . The first Clinton who owned the place had the present stairs built . " " Do many people know about the secret staircase ? That 's a senseless question . Ella Crane told me about it . " " An ' what Ella Crane knows , the whole world knows . That maid , Rena Foster , who works for Mrs. Sally Drew , come over to see it soon after the family moved in , said she 'd heard of it all her life ? she 's a village girl ? I let her go up the secret stairs , her eyes were big as saucers ? " Sarah Ann Parker 's face paled . She gasped . " You saw her , she 's the one who sneaked into this kitchen askin ' for eggs , the day Cindy fell asleep . She 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't suppose ? " " We wo n't suppose anything , we must plan , before Candy comes . " " She wo n't be along yet . You told her to repack the chest as she found it . That will take time . Are n't you goin ' to tell her what you 're plannin ' to do ? " " Later . You 're breathless . Do n't be frightened , Sary . " " Frightened ? Me ? I 'm not frightened , I 'm tickled pink . It 's exciting . Always wished I could go to Hollywood an ' act in one of those mystery movies , think I 'd be good . Now I 've 1  | got a chance at the real thing . A bag of jewels hidden in the turret . Can you beat that for a whodunit ? What do we do next ? " " Listen carefully . If anyone comes to the patio begin to shell those peas . " With his eyes on the door which opened on the hall he told of a tentative plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were responsible for hiding the jewels . Sarah Ann Parker 's nods of understanding , her muted " Yes " ? " Yes " ? " Yes " ? in answer to his questions accompanied his low voice . " You can see , ca n't you , Sary , that if the hag is removed from the chest the news is bound to leak and there would n't be five chances in ten that the person who hid it there would be caught . " " Sure , I see . " She drew a long breath . " That eases the strain . I 've been tense as a fiddlestring while I listened to what sounds more like a mellerdrama than anything that could happen in this village . Course the bag should be left where ' t was hid . I guess between us we 're smart enough to catch the fella . " " Smart is as smart does . Do n't budge from this house tonight ? you wo n't be alone , I promise . Tell Cindy she must go to the ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her you know what has happened . Everyone in town who ca n't be inside will be on the verandas of the Inn watching the masquerade through the windows . The person who hid the bag in the turret might consider this an opportunity to retrieve it , though something tells me it will stay there for a time unless the thief is tipped off that it has been found . Do n't let her stay at home . Here she corn ? " He finished the word outside the patio door .  | I do n't want the local police in on this yet , he thought , as he started his car he had left outside the garage . We 'll give them the credit but the fewer who know about this at present the better . The hidden jewels tie in with the tip given Ally Barclay to watch The Castle . Who cached them there to divert suspicion from himself or the smugglers ? It 's up to me to find out . At the same moment Cindy appeared in the doorway of the kitchen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is Bill Damon ? " " That was him just goin ' . " " Going ? Going ! Did n't he leave a message for me ? Not a word about what I am to ? " " You need n't cut off what you was goin ' to say , child . He told me what you found in the old chest along with your costumes . " " He did ? Perhaps he told you what I am to do about it ? Then again , perhaps he thinks I 'm not capable of doing anything . " " Quiet down , Cindy . It do n't suit you to be sarcastic . Trust him . He 's got everything under control . " " He has ? Just like that . The masquerade is out . I wo n't leave this house till those jewels are turned over to the police . I know he does n't think they should be , but I do . And after all , they are hidden in my house . " " Stop gettin ' so het up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Mr. Damon said ' t was most important that you and I carry on as usual , as if we did n't know nothin ' , or whoever had landed that stuff there would be hep ? that was his word ? that we 'd found it . " " Do you think I 'll leave you here alone tonight , Sary ? Not a chance . "  | " I wo n't be alone . I 've been waitin ' till you stopped boilin ' to tell you I had a phone from my brother askin ' if he could come an ' stay here for a few days . Would you mind ? " " Mind ? Of course I would n't mind . Is it Joe , the brother who lives at Grand Manan ? I think it 's wonderful . You have n't seen him for years , have you ? " " No . He has n't been very neighborly . " She sniffed . " I wonder what 's bringing him now ? I 'll bet he wants to borrow money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't he come just to see you ? He named his first daughter for you , did n't he ? " " Yes , he did , an ' he always sends me greetin ' cards Christmas an ' Easter . It was mean of me to suspect he had a motive for comin ' other than puttin ' across a lobster deal . " She low , ered her voice . " Could you get all the things back in the chest just as you found them , Cindy ? " " Slick as a bug in a rug . I brought Great-Grandmother 's skating costume , plus the skates , down to my room in case I went to the masquerade . I had to re-inter Pocahontas . I intended to convince Colonel Damon that the loot should be out of the house as quickly as I could get the police here . But , I have n't the courage to buck his decision . " " You better not . That man knows where he 's goin ' . What good will the skates do you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , are they , but such crazy things are bein ' done now I would n't put it past the summer folks . " " The skates are for atmosphere , Sary . Flooding the floor with ice ? That gives me an idea . I 'll take ? " " Now who 's at the front door ? Ringin ' an ' rngin ' ' s though he thought we was all dead or sleeping . " " Perhaps it is your brother or ? I know . It 's Tom Slade .  | In the excitement of finding those jewels I forgot we had a tennis date . Coming . Coming , " she called as she raced through the hall . She flung open the front door . " Enter , Thomas . You 're the perfect answer to this maiden 's prayer . " She regretted her fervent welcome as additional color swept to his already brightly sunburned face and his eyes darkened . This is the second man I 've greeted today as if he were a long-lost brother . I hope it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a grip which hurt . " Is this what freedom does to you ? Mean that as it sounds , Cindy ? " She shook her head . " No , Tom . I 'm sorry . I just had an inspiration for a razzledazzle entrance at the masquerade tonight and when you appeared you completed the picture . That 's all . " " It 's something to fit into a picture of which you 're a part , lovely . It might have been Harding or the Damon guy who was elected . How about it , is the tennis game on or off ? " " Off , while we plan a gigantic act , Thomas . Come to the patio while I tell you how we can rock the very walls of the Inn this evening . We 'll have to work like crazy to put it across . Are you with me ? " " I 'm sold without knowing what I 'm buying . On to the patio . Let 's stop at the kitchen and ask Sary to rustle a couple of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizzling proposition . We 'll need something iced to keep down our temperature . "  | WHERE 'D you and that Mr. Slade run off to this afternoon ? " Sarah Ann Parker inquired of Cindy seated at the glass table in the patio . Candles in tall hurricane lamps gave out a soft yellow light in the rosy dusk . She served a crystal cup heaped with fresh raspberry sherbet and set down a plate of wafer-thin cookies . " When I brought the soda lemonades you were gone . " " I had a world-shaking idea for the masquerade this evening and we rushed off to get a little practice . " " What sort of practice ? Want to know somethin ' , you looked tired to death when you got home . You did n't stop to change that green linen dress , just had time to wash up for dinner . " " I 'll be fresh as a daisy after a little rest and a shower . I have loads of time before the party . Did your brother come ? " " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed awful glad to see me , made me kind of ashamed I 'd suspected he 'd come to borrow money . He 's in the kitchen . " " I 'll stop and speak to him . Did Colonel Damon phone ? " " Yes . " Sarah Ann Parker matched Cindy 's whisper . " He asked for you . When I told him you 'd gone off with Mr. Slade , he said , Tell her to be sure , ' that 's the way he said it , sure to go to the masquerade . ' You 'd better do as he says , Cindy . "  | " I will . " She sat for a few moments after Sarah Ann Parker had closed the patio door behind her , thinking of the bag in the turret room , of her unsuccessful search for the jewel that had rolled from her lap , of Bill Damon 's insistence that she was not to call the police at present , that she must go to the dance . If the person who had hidden the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hers to see that the thief was caught . Tom Slade would have been surprised if he had known the scheme she had been concocting while apparently absorbed in what he and she were doing . Gorgeous evening . As she rose from the table she looked up at the blue sky dotted with swansdown fluffs of clouds tinted pink by the afterglow of the sunset beyond the harbor . " Wonderful world ! " she said aloud . She stopped to pick a brilliant red rose for her white fur skating cap . Shook her head . Not so good . It would give me away . My friends know that I always wear a flower , fresh or artificial , it 's what the fashion editors call my " signature . " I 'd better go in and get started on my crime-detector plan . She stopped at the kitchen door . " I am glad you could come for a visit with your sister , Mr. Parker , " she welcomed cordially . The heavy-set man with a glistening bald spot entirely surrounded by a crew-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to her greeting been prompted by a kick from Sarah Ann Parker who faced him across the food-laden table at the window ? He shuffled his feet . Thrust one hand into his red and black plaid lumberjacket pocket , took it out , repeated the process with his other . Coughed .  | " Thank you , Miss Cinderella . It sure is a treat to get to the mainland . Right kind of you to let me come . " He speaks like a Canadian . Gives each r all it has , she thought . " It is a pleasure to have you here . Stay with us as long as you can . " She ignored the violent shake of Sarah Ann Parker 's head . " It must be a treat for you two to he together . Come up when I ring , please , Sary , I may need your help . By the way , in case you should miss them , I 'm taking three of my silver cups from the old kitchen . The tennis committee of the Country Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nodded to the man who stood as if in embarrassed silence shuffling his feet . " Have fun in our wild town if you can find it , Mr. Parker . " " Thank you , Miss Cinderella , but I 'm not much of a night owl . At home I go to bed soon 's the chores are done . I hope you have fun . Sarah Ann told me you are going to a party . " " I am . " She laughed . " With bells on , figuratively speak , ing . Good night . I 'll ring when I need you , Sary . " She stepped into the old kitchen , closed the door , drew the painted window shades and snapped on the light iii the glass lamp which once had been used for oil . The pumpkin . yellow walls glowed in the light , copper saucepans shimmered like red gold . She caught a side of the cupboard and drew it forward with such care that not even one piece of the mulberry and black Canova on the shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jewels in the chest used the steep , narrow stairs behind it to reach the turret room ? They looked spooky . Creeping up was indicated . She would have to mount that way when she planted her trap . So what ? A private eye did n't stop for trifles when he started out to get his man , did he ? And I intend to get  | mine or perish in the attempt , she told herself and wondered that she could chuckle over an imagined victory which might prove a tragic reality . Better tackle her plan and not stand here thinking about it . With three silver trophy cups and one outsize copper frying pan in her arms she crept up the steep narrow stairway examining each step ahead as she went . Not a trace of dust , not a betraying footprint . The person who had hidden the jewels had n't gone up or down this way . On the second step from the top she placed the copper frying pan . Plenty large to accommodate a hasty foot . She swallowed a chuckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one else would use these stairs . She backed down cautiously and at strategic intervals parked the silver cups . They would provide an additional alarm if or as the intruder descended . For clamor they would have a police siren licked to a finish . Back in the kitchen she carefully swung the cupboard into place . Rearranged the remaining silver cups on the shelf above the old oven . Her explanation about the Trophy Exhibition would cancel Sarah 's curiosity anent the vacant spaces . An hour later she stood before the long mirror in her brilliantly lighted room analytically observing the girl who faced her . A soft briny breeze stirred the dainty muslin curtains between the long sea-green hangings at the two open windows . From the patio rose the strong scent of marigolds , the tinkle of the fountain , the monotonous chirp of crickets and a repetitive " Katy-did ! Katy did n't ! " " Sakes alive , Cindy ! " Sarah Ann Parker followed her exclamation into the room . " You gave me a start . Thought your great-grandmother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ' bout ready to run up an ' see what had happened when the bell sounded . Step away from that lookin ' glass so I can see the whole of you . " She walked around her . " Want to know somethin ' , that full red cashmere skirt with the black velvet bands round it an ' the big pockets each side looks just like a picture in the magazines you 're always bringin ' home . I guess the style has come round again . Wearin ' the panties that go with it ? " Cindy lifted the hem of the skirt that came to the tops of her white skating boots . " Ai n't they the cutest things ? Red like the skirt with narrow white lace ruffles where they hind your knees . Let 's see if they show when you dance , Cindy . Whirl ? good . " She whirled ? good ? again and again . Sarah Ann Parker nodded approval . " They do . Awful cunning . You look like a little girl . How 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big to be your grandmother 's I packed away with those clothes . " " I 'll say they are . I managed to squeeze my foot into one of hers , but I could n't fasten it . This is an old pair . I 'm taking red slippers to wear after we unmask . Something tells me that when I dance in this fur jacket I will melt away in the arms of my partner . " " What you got under it ? " " Just a thin white silk blouse . " Cindy turned back the collar of the coat to demonstrate . " Where 'd you get that string of wax beads ? " Sarah Ann Parker adjusted her spectacles and peered . " I 've never seen it before . " " One of the shops in the city had a sale of synthetic pearls , wonderful imitations at two ninety-eight plus tax . " FG  | I did n't say I bought a string , she assuaged an uneasy conscience . I have n't found the right time to tell her that Ken Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lovely things . I should have worn them to the dinner last night . I ca n't hide them forever . I 'm banking on the fact that Lyd Pane will be too busy M.C.'ing the ball to notice them . " Two ninety-eight ? Sakes alive , if they 're handsome as those I 'll buy some for my brother 's girls for Christmas . Who is taking you to the party ? " " Tom Slade . " " I wish ' t was that Colonel Damon . " " You 're completely sold on Bill Damon , are n't you ? Does n't take a mind reader to discover that he is teacher 's pet in your kitchen , and speaking of kitchens , where 's your brother ? " " He helped me with the dishes then went outside to smoke . I 'll put him in the first-floor bedroom in the ell . Is that all right ? " " Of course it is all right , Sary . Give him a good time and plenty to eat . Make hi.n realize you are glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I guess I was cordial enough . Do n't want to overdo it or he might make visitin ' us a habit . Gave me a shock when he said he did n't know how long the lobster deal would keep him here . We do n't have to cross that bridge till we come to it , though . Put on the mask and let 's see how you look . " She tucked a short golden-brown curl under the white fur cap . " I 'd never know you , Cindy , with that thing ' cross your eyes . Here 's the muff on the bed . Now you 're complete . Goin ' to carry your great-grandmother 's skates jingling from your arm like that ? Does sort of make the picture perfect .  | Bright as silver , are n't they ? I polished them the last time I went through that trunk lookin ' for moths . There 's the doorbell . Must be your beau . Goin ' to let him see your costume ? Thought it had to be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are putting on an act . " She tucked . the white satin eye-mask into a pocket of the fur jacket . " Hold my topcoat , please , Sary . The red skirt does n't show below it , I hope . I do n't want anyone to get a look at this costume before I reach the Inn . " Enveloped in a loose black-and-white checked raglan with huge pockets , the hood drawn over her head , she lingered on the threshold . " Do n't tell anyone , anyone , and that means especially Colonel Bill Damon , what I am wearing , Sarah Ann Parker . He was so cocksure he would recognize me . I want to fool him . " " Why would I tell and spoil your fun ? I was young myself , once . Do n't you stay too late . I 'll be listenin ' for you to come home . " " I sha n't stay much after midnight . I want to get back . I feel uneasy about ? you know what . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cindy , and have a good time . With my brother here do you think a person who was n't wanted could get into this house ? Joe is an ex-lightweight champion of his town . Go along , he and I will run this ranch . Your beau is ringing again . Get going , Cindy . Have fun , that 's what you 're always tellin ' me . " " I 'll have fun . " An irresistible laugh rippled . " Something tells me I am about to spring a colossal sensation . The next time you see me , Sary Ann , I bet I will have made the frontpage headlines . Wish me luck . I 'm off . "  | DID YOU GET in touch with the leader of the band , Tom ? " Cindy inquired eagerly as Slade 's car slid into the highway . " I did . After I crossed his palm with moola he was all smiles . He was sure his men would n't know The Merry-goround Broke Down ' which you and I decided would make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town on The Beautiful Blue Danube . ' " " The Blue Danube ' is an oldie , but tops . It will suit us to a T. We practiced the waltz glide to that music at the rink this afternoon . " " I 'll say we practiced , and ? how . " " The costume you picked up for the masquerade is one hundred per cent perfect for our act . " " It is a neat number . We were so busy rehearsing I forgot to tell you that your guide , philosopher and friend was in the dry goods emporium while I was there . He did n't see me , though . " " And who is my guide , philosopher and friend ? " " Playing cagey , are n't you ? Who but that guy Bill Damon ? " " Did he find a costume ? What was it , Tom ? Tell me . He was sure he would recognize me . " " Hey , get back on the beam , lovely . I do n't know . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? He 's  | a pain in the neck to me , you like him too much , but I 've got to play fair . " " You always play fair , Thomas . You are the very nicest person I know . " " Are you playing fair when you declare in that passionately convincing voice that I am the nicest person you know ? Forget it . I 'm not beefing . I 've settled down to a prolonged attack on what you think is your invincible heart . I 'm one darn lucky guy to be putting on the act with you , but , I 'm not kidding myself that I am the Prince ? yet , Cinderella . " She could n't declare that he was , better say nothing , let silence answer for her . She liked him immensely but never had felt the force of attraction that had drawn her to Bill Damon the afternoon in Ella 's shop , which had increased in power ever since in spite of her indignation when she discovered he was Ken Stewart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge it or probe into her heart . " Perhaps Damon was n't after a costume , " Tom Slade 's voice interrupted her self-examination . " He had a big man with him who looked like a movie plain-clothes guy . " A plain-clothes guy . Since she had stepped into Tom 's car she had n't given a thought to the mystery at The Castle . Had Bill Damon 's insistence that she attend the masquerade been his way of getting her off the place while he installed a detective ? Suppose the dick ? if the man who had been in the shop with him were a dick ? decided to investigate the secret staircase from the top ? " " What 's on the little mind , lovely ? You muttered , Horrors ! ' as if something had frightened the daylights out of you . " " I thought ? that roadster was heading straight for us . " " Oh , yeah ? That is n't the truth and you know it . "  | She could n't agree that it was n't the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain-clothes man pitching down the secret staircase to the accompaniment of the clatter of copper frying pan and silver cups , had stopped her breath for a minute . Again silence appeared to be golden . " Perfect night , is n't it , Thomas ? There is still a tinge of rose color in the west from the sunset , and so many stars the sky appears gold-plated . Those must be the Perseids darting through the skies trailing fiery stardust . It is the season for them . " " I ca n't concentrate on the stars , my thoughts are on my feet and what they will do to our act . Here we are . Every light in the Inn is on . " " I 'm thrilled to the marrow . This masquerade was Lyd Fane 's idea , I 'll hand it to her for planning something exciting . Now that we are approaching the scene of our triumph ? " " Jupiter , I hope it will prove a triumph . I 'm getting the jitters . " " Think defeat and you invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . We 'll be the sensation of the evening . One thing upon which we may count , there will be no audience participation in our act . " " You have something there , gal . Here we are at the rear door of the Inn . Our surreptitious entrance , our progress from this point on has been greased with folding money . Slip on your mask . I 'll put on mine later . I 've arranged to leave our coats in the dressing room off the stage of the ballroom . " " I 'll take the car , Mr. Slade . " The sepulchral whisper oozed from the shadow of a shrub . It sent icy prickles slithering along Cindy 's veins . Suppose  | the act laid an egg ? Lyd Fane would be jubilant and Tom never would forgive her for making him ridiculous . She caught his arm . " Suppose ? suppose we 're a flop , Thomas . Would n't we look silly ? " A vision of what could happen choked off her whisper . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you invite defeat , Sister Clinton . " He chuckled . " Atta gal . Step on it or we 'll be seen . Sure you 've brought your skates ? " She nodded . Her voice would n't come . " Roger ! When we get to the dressing room I 'll put them on for you . " Minutes later ? it seemed hours ? boots on with roller skates attached she had brought concealed in her coat pockets ? she stood hand in hand with Tom inside a door beside the stage which opened into the ballroom . The band was playing a polka . She tried to relax , glanced at her partner through the slits in her mask . He was trim and slender in a crimson jersey and black satin knee pants . Where had he found a costume so suitable ? He looked like a French-Canadian ice skater . The music muted to a wooing croon , softly seductive . Their cue  --  almost . She swallowed her heart which had zoomed to her throat . " Tom ! My knees have turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to turn to jelly , " he whispered hoarsely , and administered a shattering slap on her shoulder which rocked her on her skates . " Brace up . " " Ladies and gentlemen ? " the voice of the band leader was sonorously impressive ? " the management has provided a surprise for you . It presents the famous FrenchCanadian roller skate champions , the de Barcos ! "  | " Ready ? Let 's go . " An ear-splitting fanfare . A bar of " The Beautiful Blue Danube . " The door before Cindy and Tom Slade opened as if by magic . " The de Barcos " skated into the hall in perfect timing . A thunder of applause followed their entrance , died down till there was no sound but the nostalgic instrumentation of strings and brass , flutes and piccolos , a piano carrying the melody , the sound of rollers on the waxed floor . Round the hall they went , arms crossed , hands together , separated , and united . Twice they executed waltz turns before they backed toward the exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lips . They made a sweeping obeisance and disappeared . A storm of applause , shouts of " Encore ! Encore ! " followed them . " They want us back . Shall we go ? " " No . " Cindy refused breathlessly . " Why tempt Fate ? We 'll take a bow and fade away with laurel still crowning our brows . " " We put it across , Thomas , " she exulted as in the dressing room he knelt to remove her skates . " I was threatened with heart failure when you squeezed my hand to signal the first waltz turn . " " Your heart condition was n't a patch on mine . One false step , one obstruction , even so much as a bobby pin on that waxed floor and our act would have switched into an uproarious slapstick comedy . I 'll bet I aged ten years in that trip around the hall . " He pulled off her skates and put on the high-heeled red satin slippers . " There you are . All set ? Slip out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my entrance from the other side of the stage . Leave the white fur coat here with your raglan , you 'll  | die in it when you dance . You were a knockout , Cindy . You 'll be bombarded with compliments . Do n't let them turn your head ? away from me . En avant , Madame de Barco . " A tall chef in white from turban to gloves and shoes was standing near the door as Cindy entered the hall . " Voulez-vous me faire le plaisir , Madame ? " The low voice was unrecognizable . " Je suis enchantee , Monsieur , " she whispered . As he put his arm around her she glanced up . A small blond mustache outlined his upper lip , the slits in the black satin mask which covered his nose were so narrow that only a glint showed through . The " secretary " at Rockledge wore a mustache like that . Whoever he was he waltzed like a dream to the music of " Stardust . " Halfway round the hall a monk tagged his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to his lips . " Je reviendrai , Madame , " he murmured and was gone . Her eyes followed him till he was lost in the maze of dancers . To the music of " St. Louis Blues " from peasant to pirate she went . Men in the uniform of the army , air , the marines cut in ? she had n't realized there were so many ex-fighters in the town or among the summer people , apparently there were guests from other places . Each man complimented her on her performance , some in whispers , some in a guttural mutter , two in a high falsetto , all voices too well disguised to be recognizable . A woman in a costume made entirely of newssheets of the county paper from low-cut bodice to plaited skirt , with black earrings matching necklace and bracelets , carried a bundle of papers under her right arm as she flitted from dancer to dancer apparently whispering news . A mysterious  | person . The tall chef appeared fascinated by her . Each time he danced with her a clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripping with seaweeds and strings of exquisite pink shells , was Lyd Fane , undoubtedly . No wonder she had suggested a Bal Masque , with that sensational costume up her sleeve . A catty thought , Cindy reproached herself , and turned her attention to what appeared to be a college president in black cap and gown who had cut in on a Red Cross ambulance driver . For a bulky person he was extremely light on his feet . The clown touched his arm . It was the second time he had cut in on her dance . Red patches highlighted the cheekbones of his chalked face ; an enormous mouth had been painted in the same brilliant color ; a dab on the end of his nose and on his chin was black as the satin of his mask ; his white peaked cap , the rest of his costume was the typical pantaloons and blouse of the circus . The glint of eyes between the slits in his mask sent icy prickles down her spine . Memory broadcast Sary 's voice : " Get a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know who you 're dancing with ? A crook might slip in an ' hold you up . " Were his eyes fixed on her pearls or was it her hectic imagination working overtime ? She gave a little sigh of relief when he was edged out by Prince Charming resplendent in sky-blue doublet and hose , a white satin cape swinging from one shoulder , and a beret with sweeping blue plume . He had cut in so often she was sure he was Hal Harding , the elaborate costume was right up his street . A Marquise in pale pink satin , with three diamond stars sparkling on a black velvet band in her white hair , now  | dancing with the college president , was Mrs. Barclay , she was sure . She ? The tall chef laid a commanding hand on the shoulder of the Prince who muttered a protest which sounded more like a threat but gave way . The musicians were giving with saxophonic emphasis a Jerome Kern medley when she saw the clown weaving in and out among the dancers toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , " she whispered at the risk of betraying her identity . " Ile has cut in twice before . I ? I do n't like him . " A bell struck a resounding note . The music broke off in the middle of " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . " The dancers stopped . The lights went out . " At the stroke of twelve unmask . " The band leader 's voice reflected the tension that had stiffened each person in the room . Two ! Three ! Four ! Five ! Cindy 's nerves tingled as the bell tolled on . Eleven ! " You are adorable in that skating costume ? Cinderella , " whispered the chef . Bill Damon , she had time to think before the bell struck . Twelve ! Lights up . Masks off . Excited laughter . Shouted names . " I knew you all the time , " in chorus . Cindy looked up into the laughing eyes of the man beside her . No mustache , only a faint red line where the falsie had been pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I warned you I would recognize you , " he reminded . She had the curious feeling that another person , shadowy , unreal stood at his shoulder . She shook her head as if to  | clear her eyes , brushed her hand across them . Had excitement doubled her vision ? A bellhop in maroon livery with the yellow envelope of a telegram in his hand appeared in the large doorway . He cleared his throat as if from nervousness . All eyes turned toward him . Voices and laughter ceased . The air was heavy with suspense , as if each person present feared bad news . He entered the hall . " Paging ? Colonel Kenniston Stewart , " he called . " Paging Colonel Kenniston Stewart ! "  | THE MAN beside Cindy gritted a furious expletive between his teeth . His hands clenched before he signaled to the paging boy who ran across the room in answer , his footsteps echoing in the still ballroom . " I 'll take it . I am Kenniston Stewart . " IIe accepted the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crashed it in his hands . A seismic shock rippled through Cindy 's body . She remembered her inexplicable doubt that day on the beach as to this man 's identity . " Are you Ken Stewart ? " she whispered . " Yes . Can you take it , Cinderella ? You will when you look at the faces of Harding and the Fane girl who pulled this stunt . They are coming to gloat . " The trumpeter sounded the army mess call , " Come and get it ! Come and get it ! " and the laughing , colorful motley crowd , pirates and peasants , servicemen , dancing girls and chevaliers , monks and nuns made a concerted move toward the supper room . The malicious triumph which glinted in the eyes of Undine , in her wave-green costume , was duplicated in the sardonic grin of the prince in his light blue doublet and hose as they approached . Cindy considered the merits of a mad dash to the exit and The Castle and abandoned it . Why give that poisonous Lyd and Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supper room drifted the music of an accordion playing the melody of a Spanish fandango . Someone was adding a castanet accompaniment . The ballroom was empty except for the two men , the woman in green and the girl in her scarlet skating costume . " What do you think of our H bomb , Cinderella ? " Lydia mocked . She looked up and challenged , " You are Kenniston Stewart , are n't you ? You wo n't deny it , will you ? " Cindy wondered that his laugh could be so light when the lines between his nose and mouth looked as if drawn in India ink . " Deny it ? My dear woman , why should I ? You 've only beaten me to the news by a few moments . I intended to cast off my alias when we went in to supper . It has served its purpose . I figured it would add one more dramatic touch to this gala evening . " " You planned to reveal your secret to the ex-Mrs . Stewart first , I assume ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk of the arm of the chef by slipping her hand under it and holding tight . She produced what she hoped was a tormenting smile . " Sorry to spoil the little joke , Hal , that you and Lyd have been working on for days I understand ? even secrets get around ? but the ex-Mrs . Stewart ' has known the gentleman 's identity since the day of his arrival . " She looked up at the man beside her with a flicker of amused understanding , of mutual comprehension , then back with a smile and shrug of toleration to Harding and the girl . " The way your reflexes take that statement is uproariously funny . Now that is nicely settled , I suggest supper  - -  and as if to pick up his cue here comes my skating partner to escort me to the buffet . "  | When Slade reached them she transferred her hand unhurriedly to his arm . " I began to think you had forsaken me , Tommy , thought you never would come and I , literally starving . " She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " I 'll be seeing you  --  Ken . To make this the perfect end of a perfect evening , you and I should be presented with an Oscar for our gay-deceiver act . By their expressions I 'll say we fooled ' em to the hilt . En avant , Monsieur de 13arco . " She shook Slade 's arm as they crossed to the door . " For Pete 's sake , stop looking as if I had delivered a right to your jaw , Thomas . I ? I ? ca n't take ? " " Come out , Cindy . You must n't cry here . What the devil is it all about ? " He pushed her ahead of him through a doorway , arm under hers , drew her to a shadowy corner at the end of the long porch . He pulled forward a wicker chair . " Sit here , lovely . " " I ? I ? ca n't . I 'd rather perch on the railing . I sha n't cry ? again . " She brushed off two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks . " I 'm ? I 'm beginning to boil . " " Boil or cry , suit yourself so long as you tell me what it 's all about . " He leaned against an upright pillar facing her , watched her face as he shielded the light from a match he applied to a cigarette . " I came up in time to hear you call Bill Damon Ken . ' That name must have packed a wallop . I 've never seen a bronzed face turn so white as his . Take it from there , Cindy . You owe me that . " Through the open window drifted the mellow voice of the band leader singing to the accompaniment of a piano . " Night and Day . Night and Day . " " The pink light on the horizon must be the battered old  | moon rising to see the dawn come up like thunder . " She contributed the gem of observation in an attempt at casual conversation . " I do n't give a lead nickel at the present moment for the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who has been living at the Inn as Bill Damon , Kenniston Stewart ? " " That 's his story . " " Cut out flippancy . Get down to cases . " Never before had Tom Slade been curt with her . " Why did he crack through with the truth tonight ? I slipped out while the clock was striking and missed the showdown . I had a hunch I 'd better check on my car the boy drove off . " " Is it safe , Tom ? " " Sure . There have been so many automobile thefts on this shore during the last month I got the jitters . It is locked tight as I left it in the parking place in front of the Inn with dozens of models including two Town and Country convertibles like mine . I thought I had the one and only in this part of the country . I 've given you time , Cindy , to pull yourself together , now I want the truth from A to Z about this Damon-Stewart mix-up . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page the dualpersonality himself for that . " " Did n't he offer you an explanation ? " " I do n't need one . Use your imagination , Thomas . He had to come to the United States to get his fortune out of the oil holdings . When he arrived in this town the marriage contract still was valid . Undoubtedly he figured that if I knew who he was I would burst into sobs on his shoulder and beg him not to desert me . " " You are unfair to him , Cinderella . Perhaps he came here  | to get to know you because of the business interests you and he had in common , to be friends with you . Be honest , he would n't have had the smidgin of a chance had he appeared as himself , Ken Stewart , would he ? As to letting that annulment go through , I 'm with him every step of the way . What man wants to hold a woman to a written-contract marriage ? " " Does that mean you could n't love a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do love a girl who made that sort of marriage ? but it was n't to me . " Ken Stewart in white summer formals appeared suddenly from out the shadows . " Beat it , will you , Slade ? Give me a chance to talk with her . " " You 've had your chance , my God , what a chance it was . I " Do n't beat it , Tom . " Cindy interrupted his bitter accusation . " I wo n't talk with him . I 'll never speak to you again , Bill ? Kenniston Stewart . You 've made me ridiculous before ? " She stopped to recover her voice . " I 'm going ? " She deftly avoided the hands outstretched to stop her , raced along the porch , outdistancing pursuing feet , flew down the steps and along the broad drive banked solidly with automobiles on each side . Cinderella fleeing from the ball , she thought . " Red shoes run faster , " she remembered having read somewhere . Hers were fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black limousine and held her breath to listen . No sound save the ebb and flow of the tide on the beach in front of the Inn and the faint strains of  | " Old Man River " drifting through an open window . No footsteps approaching . The person who had followed her along the porch had given up the chase . Now what ? Time to think , she answered her own question . Shivered . The weather had put on a lightening-change act from the day 's heat to cold so characteristic of the region . The white fur jacket was hanging in the stage dressing room with her raglan . Were her teeth chattering from cold or fury ? The latter ought to make her hot , not cold . If she could get inside the car against which she was huddling she could cover herself with a robe ? if there were a robe ? and watch for Tom from the window . Although the license plate was n't visible the Town and Country convertible parked across the drive looked like his . No use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was locked . He would know she would be near and come looking for her . Better not dash over yet , she might be seen by Bill ? Ken Stewart , he had said he wanted to talk with her and from past experience she had learned he was not to be diverted from what he set out to accomplish . Had n't he persuaded her to accept the pearls from ? himself ? Just let her get home and they would go back to him so quick it would make his brain whirl . She tried the handle of the rear door of the limousine . It turned . She reconnoitered . No one coming along the drive either way . She cautiously opened the door . A folded robe on the back seat . Br-r-r , that puff of icy breeze was straight from the ocean . Why stand here and freeze ? Someone coming . She stepped into the car with her right foot , drew up the other . The red satin slipper dropped . At the risk of pitching out on her head she leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . She flung herself back into  | the car . The red slipper was in the shadow . She would take a chance and leave it for the present . Cautiously she closed the door , opened the window back of the driver 's seat a crack , then pulled the soft dark blue plush robe across her shoulders . Heavenly warm . She knelt before the side window , raised it a bare inch , no danger now of being knocked out by carbon monoxide , no matter what else happened , and she could see and hail Tom when he came looking for her . A stout figure plodded along the drive , the skirt of his black robe blowing in the breeze . The college president with whom she had danced twice had been Counselor Armstrong and she had n't suspected it . She had seen him several times with the Marquise in the ravishing pink costume whom she had thought was Alida Barclay . The paging bellhop had flung his surprise grenade so soon after the unmasking that her mind had been in too great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Typhoon was the word . She had thought a century of thoughts from the moment Bill Damon had held out his hand for the telegram , his cool , " I 'll take it , " and her whispered , " Are you Ken Stewart ? " His " Yes , can you take it , Cinderella ? " had been like a slim , shining knife blade thrust in her heart . Why , why had he come to this village ? Tom Slade 's sympathetic explanation was phony . Why deceive her as to his identity ? Stupid question . Only one answer . He was afraid that if he appeared as himself he might block the annulment . Block it ? Ye gods ! Had he thought for a minute she wanted to hold him to it ? I should have let him talk on the porch , she reflected . Then furiously , caustically told him what I thought of Kenniston  | Stewart , what I had been thinking through the years he sidestepped his responsibility . I wager that by the time I was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand would have been smashed and smashed hard . I missed the chance of my ? Who was opening the front door of the wheel side of this car ? She tensed to watchfulness . It closed softly . She raised herself to her knees . Someone was on the front seat , someone with a peaked white cap ? her heart flopped and righted ? it was the clown who had cut in on her dance . He still wore the black satin mask on his chalked face . She must get out . A quick move of his head knocked off the peaked white cap and revealed black hair with one deep wave smooth as if it had been marcelled and lacquered . The swoop of the car sent her back to the floor . Too late to escape . The driver was preparing to burn up the road . From what was he running away ? Tom had said there had been many automobile thefts along the coast . Was this one ? Now what ? Cautiously she raised her head till she could look from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . The car was speeding . If she jumped she would break her neck or back . If she stayed here ? that was the $64.00 question . A flash on the back window . A car following ? Was another driver suspicious of the madly speeding limousine , which was giving an excellent imitation of a jet bomber on high ? Whether it was or not the man at the wheel of this one feared it . She drew the soft robe closer about her shoulders . She could pull it over her head if there was a crash and could a crash be avoided at this speed unless the thief or madman reached the safety of his hide-out first ? a result which of- fered a more terrifying possibility than a broken neck . I 'll settle for the latter , she told herself . Another flash on the rear window . A warning siren . Were they being followed by a cruising car so early in the morning ? She threw the robe from her shoulders and applied eyes and ears to the narrow opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream her head off . The faint far whistle of a train . She looked at the illuminated dial of her wrist watch . A sense of impending tragedy set her heart pounding , blocked her breath . A freight train steamed through at this hour , she had heard it when she had a wakeful night . Past a red light . The clown at the wheel must be desperate  --  or drunk . A car behind was getting closer . Crash ! I lad the pursuer gone off the road ? A sob rose in her throat . That hope of rescue was gone . On they went . Past another stop light . The warning whistle echoed through the still morning air . Nearer this time . They were perilously close to the railroad . Had the driver heard ? Should she warn him ? Would he try to cross before the gates fell ? A shout ! The gate keeper ? The limousine bumped and swayed across the rails . The bell clanged furiously . They had made it . The gates fell . A train lumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing gates had stopped the automobiles behind them if one had been a police patrol as she had hoped . The driver increased speed . A sharp turn on two wheels . Brakes screamed . Tires slid . Instinctively she pulled the robe over her head . It might save her neck ? Was the car going over ? She clutched at the seat , at the door handle to hold herself steady . It settled back with a mighty lurch that left her dazed .  | Minutes passed before her mind came back from the threshold of unconsciousness . Voices outside . Loud voices . Rescue at last . She cautiously flexed her muscles . Nothing broken . The heavy robe had saved her . She pushed it back to get her breath . The door beside her was yanked open . Through a glare of light she caught the glitter of brass buttons . The police . She was safe . The officer with an electric torch wobbling in his hand stood for several throbbing seconds , leaning forward , his eyes fixed on her . His gloating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he think she was ?  | I 'LL CATCH HER . It 's my job now , " Slade flung over his shoulder as he started in pursuit of the girl racing along the porch . Kenniston Stewart took an impetuous step forward . Stopped . Wiser for Slade to follow and take her to The Castle . For me to try to talk to her now would be about as safe as deactivating a contact mine , he told himself . She is too furious with Kenniston Stewart to listen to him . He drew a long breath . It was a huge relief to throw off the Bill Damon alias . Voices and laughter drifted from the front of the Inn . The party was breaking up to the tune of " Good Night , Ladies . " He glanced at his watch . Two o'clock . Back and forth he paced like a bear in the confinement of a cage . Cinderella and he had provided plenty of food , a veritable banquet , of conversation for the masqueraders on their homeward way , he reflected , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatric disclosure of his identity . He 'd hand it to the Fane girl and Harding for working up a clever denouement . When the boy appeared with the yellow envelope he had wondered who was slated for congratulations or bad news . Of course he need not have accepted it ? but , for a split second he had thought it was a telegram from the War Department , he could n't ignore it and deny his name .  | He swore under his breath . If I could get my hands on Harding ? Cindy thought I started to hit the heel in the ballroom . Not there . The lift of my arm at his insinuating voice was an instinctive reflex action of the muscles . " Ken ? Ken , are you here ? " A woman materialized from the shadow , a woman in an enveloping black satin cape . The light from a passing automobile in the road below set three diamond stars sparkling in her white hair . She caught his arm . " Ken , what happened ? " she whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the only person here tonight who has n't . " " Ken , come over where I can sit on the railing . I 'm suffering the tortures of the damned from narrow shoes . " He steadied her as she mounted the rail . She kicked off two highheeled silver slippers . " The relief , the blessed relief . " She flexed her toes in their sheer nylons . " Now , tell me what happened . First what was your costume ? I did n't recognize you , though I had been sure I would . " " I borrowed an outfit from one of the chefs . Wore it over these clothes and shed it before I came out here . " " In the supper room I sensed an undercurrent of excitement , but no one would tell me what it was about . A group would stop buzzing when I joined it . What happened ? " " Sure you are warm enough ? It has turned cold . " " Plenty warm . " She drew the satin cape closer about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the ballroom when we unmasked ? " Even in the dim light he could see the added brilliance of her eyes , her heightened color . " No . If you must know the awful truth , Ken , at that cli- mactic moment I was on the ocean side of the porch where you and I sat the other evening , listening to a proposal ? of marriage , if you can believe it . " " I wo n't ask the question quivering on the tip of my tongue . " How could he laugh when his life appeared to be torn up by the roots ? " Does it mean that you are ready to give up adventure and , I quote , settle down to the tame life of a socialite ? " " Give up adventure ? I would say I heard it calling . Is n't marriage the greatest adventure extant ? I will confide the romantic details to you later ? after I have given my answer , which something tells me will be Yes . ' I have always admired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Now , to return to the buzz-buzz . What happened ? " He leaned against a porch post facing her , feeling without seeing the beauty of the star-sprinkled sky , the riding lights on boats large and small as they swayed with the tide while he told of the entrance of the bellhop with the telegram . " I have been waiting for just the right moment to tell all to Cinderella , " he concluded . " I knew that her first reaction would be furious anger at the deception ? I was sure I could meet that , we have become good friends , but to have the revelation break as it did before that crowd in the ballroom ? " " You did n't have to accept that telegram . " " I did . It might have been an order from the War Office . It was a blank sheet . Harding and the Fane girl were clever to address it to Colonel Kenniston Stewart . I could break their necks .
