Old William Hill was Niagara 's best-known riverman , a veteran of three rides through the rapids below the falls in a barrel . He was credited with recovering 177 bodies cast up by the river . Before he died in 1942 , he told his son William Jr. : " Look after the river , Red . " Red Hill worked at odd jobs , did some tourist guiding , shot the rapids himself in 1945 and 1948 , gradually developed an irresistible hankering to go over the falls from the top . If he did it and lived , he would be the fourth person in history to accomplish the feat. * Said he : " People want to see somebody go over those falls . I 'm their boy . " <P> Hill decided to make his craft as light as possible , to clear the rocks and bob quickly to the surface after the 162-ft. drop . He fashioned a cylinder of 13 truck-tire inner tubes held together with netting , fitted it with an air mattress , christened it The Thing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two miles along the banks of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls to watch the show ; Hill 's mother was among them . <P> The Thing rocketed straight out from the brink of the falls , dropped into foam , bounced into view once or twice , then vanished in the mist . A few minutes later it bobbed free of the boiling water , just as Hill had predicted , but it had been broken to a tangled , shapeless mass . Hill was gone . His mangled body was recovered 16 hours later near the pier of the famed Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat . <P> <P> * The others : Mrs. Anna Edson Taylor in 1901 ; Bobby Leach in 1911 ( he died a few years later , after slipping on a banana peel ) ; Jean Lussier , in a rubber ball , in 1928 . Two others tried and perished , in 1920 and 1930 . Red Hill saw the second die .
