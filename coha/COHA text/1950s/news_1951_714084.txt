txt The British-Iranian talks on the oil dispute , which had seemed to be on brink of collapse , got a new if precarious lease on life tonight at the seventh meeting between the two delegations . Although the Iranian delegation presented what was understood to be an essentially negative reply to the British proposals for a settlement , the negotiations continued and will be resumed again tomorrow . The result was not achieved without considerable pressure on Premier Mohammed Mossadegh and his associates . W. Averell Harriman , President Truman 's special representative , was received in audience this morning by Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi . Later , Hussein Ala , Minister of the Court , drove to Dr. Mossadegh 's house 1where an extraordinary meeting.of the Cabinet was being held , and conferred with the Premier behind closed doors for twenty minutes . Meanwhile , the Senate today voted filial approval of the bill ratifying the $25,000,000 ExportImport Bank loan to Iran . The money will be used for development projects . First Appearance at Parley For the first time since the beginning of the oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tonight 's session at the Saheb Gharanieh Palace in the northern suburbs of Teheran . At a ' press conference following the session , Richard Stkes , head of the British delegation to the oil negotiations , said that as the Iranian reply had been written in Persian he had not ? yet been able to take cognizance of its tenor . It was announced by both delegations , however , that the reply would be made - public tomorrow night . As far as could be ascertained from Iranian sources , the reply takes particular exception to the two major provisions in the British proposals  --  the metamorphosis of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company into a purchasing organization that would handle Iranian oil exports on the basis of a price reduction calculated to result in a fifty-fifty share in the net profits and the establishment of a predominantly British operating agency to run the industry locally under Iranian authority . The reply is believed to point out that these provisions are wholly unacceptable because Iran is not prepared to grant a virtual monop= oly to a single foreign concern especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granting Iran a discount . The Iranian delegation rejects the suggestion for an operating agency since this would simply be another way of " camouflaging " the continued presence of the Anglo-Iranian company . Contracted to Agency Under the British proposals , the British staff in the oil fields would be under contract to the operating ' agency and not to the National Iranian Oil Company . This is in line with the position taken by British engineers and technicians who have said they would continue to work in Iran only under a completely efficient and predominantly British management . However , the Iranians insist on individual contracts . They hold that it would be a violation of Iranian , sovereignty and independence if contracts were concluded by virtue of international obligation . The basic Iranian argument is that the proposals put forward by Mr. Stokes are not in conformity with the March 20 nationalization law and with the formula negotiated by Mr. Harriman before the talks b beoun . Mr. Stokes , however , has insisted that his proposals are in complete harmony with both law and formula . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept Mr. Harriman informed at all stages in the formulation of his proposals and had " every reason to suppose " that they met with his full approval . Tonight , Mr. Stokes said that as a result of the latest session at the Saheb Gharanieh Palace it " should be abundantly clear " to the Iranians that Mr. Harriman supported his proposals . Hopes for Agreement in Week Mr. Stokes said the Iranian reply was " presumably in answer to my request to be told where my , ' proposals conflict with the March ' 20 law , coupled with the Harriman formula . " He was sure Iran wanted ' to come to a settlement and hoped that the conference would be con-1 eluded satisfactorily within one ' week . " I am not a great believer MI bargaining , " Mr. Stokes continued . ' " I prefer to put my best offer for- ' ward and then stick to it . " He mentioned the Iranian apprehension that the British proposals ' were " camouflage " rather than al totally new offer . He expected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iranians they had got the wrong impression . He did not exclude the possibility , of making " minor adjustments " within the principles set forth in his proposals . Karim Sanjabi , Minister of Education and a member of the Iranian delegation , gave his version of tonight 's session . He said the suggestion that an informal meeting with a free exchange of views be , held had come from Mr. Harti- ' man and had been welcomed by the Iranians . " Most of the talk was about the eight points-and the Iranian contention that they are not in conformity with the nationalization law , " he said . " Harriman urged both sides to come to terms and remove their differences . Stokes ' proposals , when they were first presented , placed us in an awkward position and left room for concern . Tonight there seemed to be a desire to modify the proposals to meet our point of view . " Mr. Sanjabi insisted that he was not under the impression that Mr. Harriman had supported the British proposals as they stood .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
