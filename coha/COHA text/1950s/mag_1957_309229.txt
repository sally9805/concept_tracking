" <P> The five-column picture showed Britain 's Prince Philip in Denmark standing over a simpering nurse named Peggy Goodchild ( see cut ) . But if the Express ( circ. 4,042,334 ) knew what " caused the twinkle in the Prince 's eye and the obvious blush on the maiden 's cheek , " it was not telling . Instead , it offered a 100 ( $280 ) prize to the reader who sent in a caption arch enough to " capture the mood of the moment in the brightest way . " <P> While-as the Express claimed-20,000 readers scurried to tell the editors just what the Prince could have told the bashful maid , the rival Daily Mirror ( circ. 4,649,696 ) rode TO THE RESCUE one day before the Express ' deadline .

Not only was the Prince not talking to the nurse when the picture was taken , but she was talking to someone else ( Queen Ingrid of Denmark ) , as the uncropped photograph showed ( see cut ) . <P> Unabashed at being caught with shears in hand by its leading competitor , the Express next day awarded the prize to a Mrs. Anne Reid , who had apparently not read the Mirror lately . Her entry : " Read Any Good Thermometers Lately ? "
