<P> Both Bolivians and foreigners-analyzing the problems of making a workable economic and political unit out of landlocked , geographically fractured , 68% illiterate Bolivia-have for a century been prone , in moments of desperation , to wry variations of the we-give-up suggestion that the country and its headaches should be divided among its neighbors . This rueful jest , repeated by a U.S. official in La Paz and quoted in TIME 's March 2 issue , was turned last week into the spark for three days of anti-U.S . violence. * <P> " Imperialism 's Vile Claw . " The day Bolivia 's 670 copies of TIME arrived by air , they were taken by special order straight to the palace of President Hernn Siles Zuazo , whose ambassador in Peru , getting the magazine a day earlier , had alerted him . Siles made the story the topic of a six-hour Cabinet session , then issued a statement blasting the remark as " damaging to the national honor " and " absolutely inadmissable . " The statement gave the Bolivian public to understand that the remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next day Siles turned the magazines over to TIME 's La Paz agent , but as the agent lugged them out of the palace he was waylaid by waiting members of the M.N.R. Youth-a Siles-supporting branch of the government 's National Revolutionary Movement-and all the magazines were stolen . A day later two La Paz papers ran translations of the story , including the point that the remark was in jest , but the official government newspaper La Nacin banner-lined : TIME , THE FINGERNAIL OF IMPERIALISM 'S VILE CLAW , OFFENDS BOLIVIA . Next morning 2,000 blue-jeaned high school students marched through downtown La Paz chanting " Down with imperialism ! " and " Bolivia will not be a Yankee colony ! " <P> Flag for Burning . That afternoon , ten minutes after Charg d'Affaires Wymberley Coerr ( the embassy is between ambassadors ) returned from delivering a note to the Foreign Ministry stating the U.S. position that there was " no evidence " that the statement was ever made , the demonstrators were back again . They were joined by a noisy , violence-bent band of Trotskyites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movement . ( A big banner demanded the establishment of diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R. ) They burned the carefully hoarded copies of TIME on the doorstep of the seven-story building whose top three floors the embassy occupies , stoned windows , produced a homemade facsimile of the U.S. flag ( with four-pointed stars ) to burn on the smoldering ashes . Surging up to the U.S. Information Service Library a block away , they smashed more windows . " <P> President Siles appeared at the edge of the mob . He marched straight through , headed for M.N.R. headquarters two blocks away , and the crowd followed . There , from a balcony , he pleaded that " shouts do not solve anything , and violence is useless , " but he denounced TIME 's correspondent as a " journalist without scruples . " Out of control , the rioters followed their leaders to stone Point Four 's La Paz offices and smash 25 heavy trucks and pickups of the U.S.-Bolivian Roads Service . During one of the attacks , a 15-year-old student was killed .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
