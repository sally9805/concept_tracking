When Ida Muia Donnelly was born 24 years ago in Montrose , Pa. , she had two strikes against her : from both mother &; father ( who were first cousins ) , she had a heritage of Mediterranean anemia , in which the red blood cells are abnormally thin . Ida had a doubly severe case of the disease , which afflicts ( generally mildly ) many Italians , Greeks , Syrians and Armenians , and their U.S.-born offspring . <P> Mediterranean anemia can not be cured by iron treatments or removal of the spleen ; it can only be relieved by transfusions of blood containing husky red cells . With good care and many transfusions , Ida grew up into a vivacious , healthy-looking girl .

The Donnellys could not afford $35 a pint , but newspaper appeals brought 1,500 volunteer donors . <P> To avoid complications in childbirth , the doctors decided upon a Caesarean . Last week , with Dr. Nittis hovering nearby , a technician poured more than a quart of blood into Mrs. Donnelly 's veins as two surgeons performed the operation . The patient , under spinal anesthesia , clutched a rosary and a religious medal . When she was told " It 's a boy , " she murmured " Thank you , dear God , " and fell asleep . <P> In his studies of Mediterranean anemia , Dr. Nittis has never known a victim with so severe a case as Ida Donnelly 's to survive for 24 years , let alone carry a child full term . Now she has enough blood credits to last her for years . And 7-lb . Raymond Edwin John Donnelly Jr . can thank his father for the fact that his blood seems free of the taint .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
