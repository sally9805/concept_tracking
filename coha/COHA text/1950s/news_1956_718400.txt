Decision on Anglo-French Action Examined The writer of the following letter , a former Member of Parliament , served for some years as Adviser on American Affairs to the British Ministry of Information . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I write this letter as one whose life for many years both inside and out of politics has been devoted tto bringing England and the United States ever closer together . In company with many others I feel sick at heart by events of the past few months . There is , I think , general agreement among the Western democracies in wanting peace and stability in the Middle East . The only question is hold best this can be achieved . Now that the British and French foreign ministers have announced that their military forces will be withdrawn from Egypt in compliance with the demand of the U. N. , the grave responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N ; and then in turn upon the United States . Yielding to U. S.-U . N. Policy There is little to be gained at this point in further recriminations . Sincere men can argue endlessly as to whether Britain or America has been right in this crisis . But the argument is now moot , for Britain and France have finally yielded to the United States-United Nations policy of leaving President Nasser , the Communist-backed dictator of . Egypt , seemingly in command of the situation . Will this preserve peace ? Will it lead to international control of the Suez Canal whereby Europe 's economy can be maintained ? Will it lead to a permanent settlement of the boundary dispute with Israel ? Will Colonel Nasser now renounce his determination to exterminate Israel ? Will he respect and abide by the decisions of the U. N. ? Without regard to previous attitudes we must all hope that the answers to these questions is Yes . But what if they are less than yes ? Under the pressure of the United States the United Nations has taken jurisdiction of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If events show it can compel obedience from the Western democracies but it is hopeless to deal with dictators small or large ? Future Possibilities Suppose Colonel Nasser after the British and French forces have been withdrawn refuses to accept the decisions of the U. N. ? Suppose he continues his aggressions against neighboring states ? Suppose with the backing of Communist Russia Nasser runs the Suez Canal without regard to the vital interest of other countries ? These are all questions which judging from past history are more likely to eventuate than not . They are questions to which we must give immediate consideration , for the future of the U. N. depends on how they can be dealt with . I think most fair-minded men would agree that if the U. N. is to exert effective authority it must exert it universally , and by that I mean dictators as well as the Western democracies . Otherwise the democracies will be fatally handicapped . Today the U. N. has exacted obedience from England and France . But what happens tomorrow when Colonel Nasser , or some other dictator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. ? Will the United States then be prepared to , provide the leadership ? RONALD TREE . - New York , Dec. 6 , 1956 . Javits ' Activities Questioned TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As an attorney who believes very strongly in civil rights , I was pleased to see that Senators Case and Ives have pledged help to the liberal Democrats in the fight against the filibuster rule . But where will Senator-elect Javits be in this important fight ? Will he be in Washington when the Senate votes on the rule changes , or will he be in Albany holding on to the Attorney General 's office until the State Legislature can appoint a Republican to replace him ? This is a question that voters in New York State have a right to ask and only Mr. Javits and his conscience can answer it . GEORGE NIMS RAYBIN . New York , Dec. 3 , 1956 . Increasing Interest on Savings To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The action of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest on savings accounts in commercial banks is not wholly a deflationary measure , On the contrary , in an important respect , the effect may be inflationary . As has been pointed out , commercial banks can lend $2 for every $1 in a savings account , whereas mutual savings banks can never lend more than the dollars they receive for safekeeping . It follows that to the extent that commercial banks are now in a more favorable position to compete for the savings dollar which otherwise would be deposited with our savings institutions , credit is expanded manifold . Many will deplore this step as an ill-timed assist to rampant ' commercial banking expansion . In this area , at least , it will not certainly have the desired economic effect of contracting credit . Commercial bankers are not anxious to have their savings account with a 2 to 1 credit ratio grow al the expense of their own demand accounts with a 6 to 1 credit ratio . They are in business to satisfy the credit needs of their customers . Thus the only result of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to wean away hard , solidi sound , savings dollars from savings , institutions . LEWIs S. BOWDIBIL New York , Dec. 5 , 1956 . Cuba 's U. N. Resolution Basis Is Given for Desire to Invoke Genocide Convention To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMM The New York Times has always supported the Genocide Convention and has inspired many people . around the world to worlt for this great humanitarian cause . I sincerely regret the criticism ex. pressed by Arthur Krock in his col ? umn of Nov. 22 in regard to the Cuban resolution invoking the Genocide Convention in the United Na ? tions in connection with the tragio events in Hungary . Mr. Krock apparently agrees with the Cuban delegation that genocide is taking place in Hungary . However , he thinks that the Soviet Union and the satellites have removed all the responsibility for genocide by having ratified the convention with reservations , in particular to Article IX of the convention , which deals with the competence of the International Court of Justice . Claim Unchallenged I think I have proved through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Cuban resolution has been introduced according to Article VIII of the Genocide Convention , which per . sits bringing up cases of genocide in all organs of the United Nations , To this article the Soviet Union has not made any reservations , and our international legal claim to preserve the life of the Hungarian nation remains unchallenged . In a matter like genocide one must act with full speed in order to prevent the spread of disaster tat human life and physical integrity , Action through the International Coda of Justice would take , any way , more than six months , and therefore , irrespective of the Soviet reservations to Article IX , the Cuban delegation has chosen to proceed according to Article VIII . The Genocide Convention is an ape propriate legal instrument to deal with this matter , because it defines well this typically Soviet crime and it permits us to protect some hundred millions of captive people who are subject now to gradual destruction , especially where those parts of the people who provide national cohesion are being removed . EMILIO NUNEZ PORTUONDO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dec. 4 , 1956 . Mr. Krock &Tiles; TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I had no thought of " criticizing " the Cuban resolution , with the moral purpose and objective of which I expressed the agreement that Ambassador Nunez concedes . My article was merely a report of the effect of the Soviet Union 's reservations to its sham " ratification " of the genocide pact . This effect is to nullify , so far as the Soviet Union and its satellites are concerned , Article IX , which subjects Governments charged with genocide to judicial review by the International Court of Justice . Cuba , as the Ambassador asserts and I heartily concur , has found the way to bring the issue before another court -- the court of world opinion . ARTHUR KROCK . Washington , Dec. 8 , 1956 . Use of U. N. Force Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If the United Nations police force is to leave the Suez area as soon as the British and French get out , why was it needed in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without all the expenditure of money , effort and debate necessitated in creating the police force . It would seem that such a force should have one of two purposes:1 to prevent trouble or to halt trouble , until the United Nations can settle the trouble itself , Evidently thus will not be true in the case of Suez . Therefore , not only will a great opportunity have been lost to make the United Nations the effective world organization for peace that it should be , but the conviction will gradually strengthen that the machinery of the United Nations has been used both to perpetuate trouble and to favor the dictatorships , which have been the chief troublemakers . SAUL SIEGELSC HIFFER . New York , Dec. 3 , 1956 . Equal Economic Treatment To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES To maintain a successful democracy all citizens similarly situated economically must be treated equal . ly . It will not do to tax the homeowner in Queens County , or else . where , who has a $4,000-$6,000 income ( and there are thousands of them ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city dweller of the same income . That proposed inequality of treat+ ment is , I believe , what beat hous ? ing Proposition No. 2 in the recent election . LYLE T. ALVEBSOli ? New York , Dec. 3 , 1956.
