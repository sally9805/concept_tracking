? Shanty boating on the upper Missouri River has been a thing of the past for many years . At least , it was until we came along . In a home-built craft , launched to the hand wringing of friends made fearful by the river 's reputation Inc treachery , we spent three weeks drifting the 450 miles from Omaha to Boonville , Missouri . The trip , over a reach of river largely blocked off from man by a bordering bottom-land jungle of willows and cottonwoods , was one of solitude and a quietness and beauty to treasure . A shanty boat is a variety of houseboat built to travel . It has no power of its own , but moves by drifting with the river 's current . Some shanty boats , ours among them , arc steered and handled by means of sweeps , which arc simply oversized oars . Others arc towed by a johnboat ? a square-ended river skiff propelled by either oars or an outboard motor . While shanty boats arc loutish craft , they also have char  --  acteristics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own boat . Most shanty boats , over  --  sized and heavily built , hang back sullenly when prodded by the oars , yet gallop out or control at the nudging of the slightest breeze , In contrast to these tendencies are their good traits . The square box of a cabin has an airi. nest and roominess unknown to conventional boats of equal size . And there is no motor to intrude on the river 's quiet . By scaling the boat down in size to make it light and maneuver  --  able , we hoped to overcome the mulish quali  --  ties of shanty boats while retaining , so far as possible , their favorable attributes . Function thus determined form and dimen  --  sion . The hull , built of marine plywood , is eighteen by eight feet . Of the length , ten feet was allocated to the cabin . The interior ar  --  rangement is conventional . Two long benches which provide sitting space by day have backs that swing up to form double bunks by night . With air mattresses , this arrangement pro  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with a small sink , and a two-burner kerosene stove , an ice chest and a closet that houses certain conveniences and serves as a hanging space for clothes . Two five-gallon cans purchased at an Army-surplus store carry our water supply , and bins and drawers tucked here and there provide adequate storage space . Six windows make the cabin an airy one , while screens guard against insects . The boat , begun in a burst of enthusiasm , was slowed at mid-point in its construction by more sober reflection . As the geometric an  --  gularity of the craft took shape against the soft whiteness of the spiraca bushes , I found myself wondering if I was unfairly forcing my " crew " to share in what I suspected was a middle-aged reversion to romanticism . There is an inescapable element of crudity to river travel , while privacy is difficult to achieve on a small boat . Although my wife , Dorothy , has demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to my enthusiasms in the past , / wondered if I was asking her to take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ femi  --  ninity . I debated , too , whether my nine-year-old son , John , might not find that being con  --  fined to 144 square feet of space spelled im  --  prisonment rather than adventure . The per  --  son I worried about least was Tom Green , a sixteen-year-old farm lad who came along to help handle the boat . I knew him to be even of disposition , possessed of an instinctive water savvy that came from growing up alongside the river , and equipped with a farm youth 's levelheadedness . Yet closeness of living can do strange things . My worries were compounded by concern for our safety . Towboat pilots and Army Engi  --  neers of my acquaintance had warned me that the Missouri , a hazardous river at best , is par  --  ticularly dangerous for a small boat without a motor to pull it to safety in moments of emer  --  gency . The catalogue of hazards is a lengthy one . It includes wind , pile dikes , the danger of being swept into a bridge pier by the current , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Missouri 's tradition , and the threat of meeting a big tow in a tight bend . Of these , the worst arc the pile dikes , the principal tool used by Army Engineers to control the Mis  --  souri . These arc wide-spaced fences of piling driven out into the river . In places they line the banks like the teeth of a comb . Small boats swept into the piling and pinned there by a stiff current are almost invariably capsized and their occupants drowned . On our reach of the Missouri , where a brute of a river always did limit their numbers , shanty boats disappeared altogether at about the time pile dikes came into use . I came to wonder if I was endanger . ing my family to satisfy a whim . I polled the crew . The manner of their re  --  sponse revealed an eagerness that matched my own . So , with a resolution always to be careful , we dunked the boat at a small-boat harbor north of Omaha and prepared to set out . The night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a surprise partyarranged for us by our fellow boat owners . We dumped armloads of bedding , clothes and blankets on the foredeck and hurried two blocks to the cottage of the harbor 's operator , Ed Henkel , where our hosts were waiting . No one noticed the thunderstorm , typically Midwestern in its suddenness and intensity , until it exploded . We dashed fur the boat , where our belongings lay unprotected . Before we had gone a dozen paces we were soaked ; by the time we reached the boat we were drip  --  ping . So was our gear . We pitched it inside by the armload and followed it into the cabin . Drenched and shivering , and with no dryclothing to change into , we could only fish the blankets out of the mess and crawl into our hunks . Wool , we had read , is warns even when wet . It is n't . We spent a night of misery , and it was a relief when day finally came and we could leave our bunks . On deck we found a dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the stillness we could hear the muted mutter of the river , swollen by the night 's rain , We found ourselves speaking guardedly as we untied and poled the boat to the harbor entrance . The river was littered with drift racing by . As we left the ( Continued on Page +2 ) ( Continued from Page 191 harbor mouth the current caught at the boat with a force that caused it to lurch . We were twisted around and carried downstream . Across our course , the wa  --  ter boiling through its openings , stretched a pile dike . Torn and I laid into the oars with a des  --  peration that caused the ash sweeps , stout as they were , to bend . The boat eased into midstream and into the clear . When it was finally obvious that we would miss the dike , we looked back . The banks had moved in to block off the harbor en  --  trance . We were on a strange stretch of river  --  and on our own . It was a moment of triumph for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since a shanty boat is a one-way craft incapable of retracing ground already covered , a test run beforehand had been impossible . Not until the first dike was cleared and we were actually under way did we know whether we could make the voyage at all . When we came to the next dike we worked just as hard at the oars , but with  --  out the lash of desperation . The boat avoided it easily . At the third dike Tom took the oars alone . He had no trouble . The boat was proving to be what I had hoped  --  maneuverable and easy to handle under oars . At this discovery we relaxed , but not for tong . The bend ahead unfolded to re  --  veal the trusswork of the Mormon Pi  --  oneer Memorial Bridge . Bridges , we had been warned , were second only to the dikes as major hazards . The closer we got , the more formidable the bridge looked . The river , galloping from the night 's rise . flung itself against the pier which we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave flung up by its sharp edge told of the current 's vi  --  olence . I found myself gripping the sweep so tightly that my muscles rebelled , and I suspect Tom was equally tense . River crises usually are marked by their inevitability rather than their suddenness . We stood with oars poised , ready to try to grab the boat should it start flinging itself at the pier , It drifted true and straight . The closer we got , the greater the danger seemed . Our attention was riveted so in  --  tently on the al-sharp edge of the pier that we did n't realize our closeness to the bridge until the foredeck was shadowed and we were under the span . Seconds later we were safe on the other side . Never was anticlimax more welcome . For us , the pleasure of the trip dated from that moment . Apprehension was be  --  hind us and , with the sun warming us , so was physical discomfort . The rest of the day we ran with an exhilaration that was almost intoxication . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reaction set in . Almost too tired to eat , we went to bed before it was dark enough to light the propane-gas lantern . Possibly the misery of our start made the following days seem more idyllic . The sun , hack-lighting the willows into shim  --  mering gold , was barely up when we awakened . Tom and I rowed out of the slack water , the current gathered us up and the banks started marching past . The morning coolness nibbled at us de  --  liciously . Presently the aroma of coffee wafted up from the cabin . The moment was a magic one . The first day it had been enough that we were able to travel the river at all . The constant work with the oars had been be  --  side the point . Now . with thc boat 's capa  --  bility demonstrated , we sought to lessen the physical demand on ourselves . We set out to learn the fine art of drifting , which is manipulating a boat in such a manner that the river does the work . To use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is more complex than it might seem . The Missouri is actually two rivers . There is , of course , the stream itself . But within this , where a concentrated flow produces the greatest depth and the swiftest current , there is the channel . Wiggling around within the bank lines and following its own course , the chan  --  nel only coincidentally follows the direc  --  tion of the river itself . We have found twenty feet of water four feet off the bank at places , while a sand bar would come up for air in the exact center of the stream . Staying in the channel would be easy could a boat be guided visually . It ca n't . Oar blades ca n't be seen two inches below the surface of the Big Muddy . Boat pilots have an exact mental picture of the river 's underwater contours , gained by long ap  --  prenticeship . They bulwark this by an ability to " read " the river , detecting hid  --  den hazards by such surface indicators as riffles , eddies and slicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow water , while a boat will fight its rudder under certain conditions  --  tells them much . Since we were birds of passage , these skills were too subtle for us to hope to acquire . Yet we did learn rudimentary tech  --  niques that were sufficient for our pur  --  pose . Our guide became the river itself . In the curves , centrifugal force throws the water into the bend , putting the channel right against the hank line . When ad  --  jacent bends curve in opposite directions , the channel moves from one side of the river to the other in a " crossing . " No two crossings are alike . Some are " square , " some " easy , " and still others are " dou  --  ble , " requiring a boat to start across , double back and then go over to the other side . Crossings are the amateur navigator 's downfall . Fortunately we found the crossings all so well marked with buoys that we had little difficulty . Only once did we " get out of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the Illinois Central bridge at Council Bluffs , we came into a place where the river was being moved around by Army Engineers . Confused , we wan  --  dered into slack water and had to row nearly a mile to get into the current again . The boat felt as though we were pulling it through sirup . The labor involved in that mistake made us alert not to repeat it  --  and we did n't . Just as we learned the characteristics of the river by experimentation , so did we work out the technique for handling the boat . The first day we had been constantly at the oars . By the time we reached Plattsmouth , thirty-seven miles down . stream , we had started letting the boat find its own way . This it insisted on doing in its own fash  --  ion . Left to itself , the boat demonstrated that it floated best going broadside to the current . Most of our trip was made in this position . Occasionally the interplay of current and wind sent it downstream in lazy circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On other occasions it quartered or drifted stern to . Never did it voluntarily go bow on . We let it run as it would , using the oars only to keep on course . It was first a source of amazement and then of satisfac  --  tion to discover how little control the boat required when there was no wind . In the bends the turbulence of the water piling against the bank acted as a sort of cushion to hold the boat off . On crossings , where the current did not always follow the line of buoys , we might be called upon to row for intervals of five minutes or so to get the boat back in line . Tom and I , on our alternate watches of one hour each , spent most of the time in a deck chair . Eventu  --  ally we reached the point of feeling im  --  posed upon if we had to take more than a few strokes . The boat once went as far as five miles  --  nearly two hours ' time  --  with  --  out our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rounded portions of two bends and made a crossing , all without guidance . By the time we passed Nebraska City , sixty-live miles ( Continued on Page 46 ) 4b ( Continued from Page 42 ) downriver , our daily routine had pretty much fallen into a pattern . its preliminary came each morning when Tom and I arose to shove off the boat and jointly row it out of the slack water . When we reached the current and it gathered us up for the day 's run , the coffee would be boiling on the stove below . Tom took over the oars while I had my morning cup on the cabin roof , savoring the fresh newness of the day along with the brew . When the successive emergence of John and Dorothy signaled an end to slumber , were frequent , because there was almost always something to see . The quietness of our going carried us upon wildlife un  --  detected , while the slowness of our speed gave an almost hypnotic fascination to the beauty of a vista opening up ahead . Upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up beneath the lime  --  stone ledges on the Nebraska side for shade . As we sat on the foredeck with our after-dinner coffee , a fisherman and his ten-year-old son came alongside in their johnboat . They had a woodland shyness that captivated us . We invited them to look our outfit over . In turn , the fisher  --  man , on leaving , pressed upon us the cat  --  fish and two carp that lay in the bottom of his boat . We accepted for fear of giving offense , although the fish perhaps repre. sented the man 's entire day 's income . The incident was typical of the friendli  --  ness that was one of the most pleasant facts of our trip . A stop at a farmhouse to make a phone call home invariably was followed by a visit and a parting present of tomatoes and cucumbers . One woman volunteered to drive seven miles to get a spare tray of ice cubes from her refrigera  --  tor because we were unable to find ice for sale . When towns lay back from the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but almost always we were given rides . Whenever it was possible for them to do so , boat pilots cut their motors to spare us from being banged around in their wave wash . When we commented on the friendli  --  ness as unusual , people along the way said it was nothing of the kind . Many river folk , they explained , have gravitated to the willows because , noncompetitive and basically gentle , they are fugitives from the combative aspects of life . If these arc qualities that limit many to a marginal existence , they also are characteristics that warm the welcome of strangers . While the attitude of river people was constant , that of townsfolk along the way seemed to be keyed to geography . Degree of friendliness , we found , was propor  --  tional to the softness of accent . To us , Southern hospitality is a demonstrated fact . The crew made its own contribution . My wife enjoys people with a genuineness that can not , be diminished by the occa  --  sional weird experiences that result . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raccoon 's curiosity in ferreting out details of river life ? Tom automatically gravi  --  tated to the drugstore , the teen-age social center of any village , and within ten min  --  utes was accepted as one of the group . With such uninhibited gregariousness on the part of my traveling companions , my own tendency toward diffidence proved no barrier , as it usually does , to meeting people . I confess that I enjoyed the experience . And so we moved . When the boat passed the mouth of the Nodaway , we re  --  called that it was the point from which Wilson P. Hunt and his Overland Astori  --  ans began the keelboat race with Manuel Lisa upstream to the Arikara nation . Since our craft was a lineal descendant of the old keelboats , we tried to capture a feeling of identification as we moved past . We could n't . Physical accomplishment contrasted too greatly for any feeling of mutuality . Lisa 's crew , in what stands as an achievement of endurance and deter  --  mination , averaged eighteen miles a day upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swift water in the bends that lifted our speed briefly to as much as seven miles an hour , we made no more than thirty-seven miles a day . And once , bucking a headwind , it took us four hours to travel four miles . But our purpose was fun and not speed . Our success in achieving it was measured by the way the river captivated us . When we went on shore , We found an element grown alien . The towns closed in on us and their heat weighted us down . We found ourselves hurrying through our shopping to get back to the boat and the peace of the river . At lirst we thought that the river 's fasci  --  nation was burn of novelty and inexperi  --  ence . We found that it is shared by all who come on the Missouri . It was put into words by G. J. Yocum , a timber drifter who makes his living by nosing his boat among wrack heaps to salvage piling that has come loose and planking from bridges washed out by rises on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above St. Joseph , towed us to the bank for our nooning and chatted through the meal . " The most peaceful place in the world , this river , " he said . " You can get all knot  --  ted up and mean-feeling inside , and come out here and in a little while you 're not mad at anyone . " That c%crong , sot days and 184 miles after our start , we reached St. Joseph . We lay at a sand-and-igas el-company plant until the following noon while we replen  --  ished supplies and made an overdue seat to a laundry . After our nights in the quiet of the willows , the throbbing undertone of the city and the jangle of activity tit the nearby railroad yards made sleep slow to come . Sleeplessness paid a dividend . The night watchman , seeing a light still burn  --  ing at midnight , came to the boat to to use the employees ' shower at the gravel plant . That the offer occurred to the man marked him as a person of After being limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shower , with its hot , soapy and extrava  --  gantly abundant water , was luxury indeed . Below St. Joseph the riser grew progres  --  sively bigger . The stream was unchanged in character or in muscularity , but mere size made it easier to deal with . We had a thoroughfare rather than an alley in which to maneuver the boat . We also had a change in the weather . Temperatures , which had been unseason  --  ably cool , turned abnormally hot . AI Atchison and Leavenworth and other towns along the way the temperature con  --  sistently stood above the 100-degree mark , While the river blunted the heat somewhat , the weight of the sun and the glare off the water revealed that the lack of an awning was a major shortcoming . The weather was bearable and even pleasant during the forenoons and early-evening hours . But the afternoons , we discovered , ware the price we paid for our mornings and evenings on the river . Along with the heat came the wind . There seemed to be a thermal relation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reached peak velocity about noon and then held steady until it tapered off about 3:00 o'clock . Almost always it was a head wind . The hours of lazing at the oars ended when the march of riffles across the water marked the approach of the breeze . The boat 's three-inch draft gave the hull only a slight bite on the water while its sides reached up into the wind like a sail . The slightest breeze whipped the craft around like a tumbleweed . Only by steady labor at the sweeps could it be held in place . As best we could , we developed wrin  --  kles to cope with the wind . On bends we pulled in as close to the shore as we dared to gain the shelter of the banks When the wind held us back and the drift went speeding by , we dropped an oar alongside as a leeboard against which the current could user ( a solid push . We even used the cabin sides as sails , holding the boat at a tacking angle to try to make the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices cased but did not elimi  --  nate the problem of the wind . As a result , we present ' ' , adopted a new schedule . Each noon , when the breeze reached its peak , we tied up in the shade of a big tree overhanging the water . There we would laze until after two o'clock , when the wind was due to begin tapering off . To compensate for the interval of idleness , we started in the first grayness of day and ran late in the summer twilight . This weather-enforced schedule brought Its own delights . The early hours were the beautiful ones on the riser . Dawn turned the morning fog to the pink of carnival cotton candy , while herons waded in the still-shadowed shallows . Navigating was at its most leisurely in the quiet coolness and our best mileage was run up in those hours . The noon stops were the high point of the day for John , who barely took time to complete his standing assignment of making the mooring line fast before he Was cat exploring an always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night 's fishing . Evenings , when the river turned to molten silver and the headlands to black velvet , were the time of fulfillment. 4-8 From the time we set this new pattern of drifting , we varied it only once . That was the day when , our water gone , we elected to run through the midday period without stopping to reach Kansas City , an even 250 miles from our starting point . The sun was more unrelenting and the wind even more savage than usual . By two o'clock we were wilted and dead beat . As our reserves of resistance and strength scraped bottom , the Gasconade , an Army Engineers ' boat , came along and offered us a tow . Never was a lift better timed . The airy shade of the pilot house was luxurious , while the boat brought us in early enough so that we could look over Kansas City , which is always fascinating in its masculine huskiness . While we had tentatively planned to lay over here for a day , our phobia for towns seized us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the wind lay still and a perfect day of drifting followed . At noon we went ashore at Missouri City , whose wooden awnings and false fronts make it look like a movie set . Toward day 's end we came to Jackass and Sibley bends , which we went into with some apprehen  --  sion . The navigation charts warn that both have treacherous currents ; it was at Sibley that the steamer Minnesota four years ago rammed the bridge pier and sank . Although Jackass has a hairpin shape and the channel comes under the bridge at Sibley at an angle that must age towboat pilots , our boat found its way around both with only an occasional assist from the sweeps . We tied up for the night below the Sibley bridge , dutifully grateful for our safety but feeling a little let down that the experience had been so uneventful . The day we left Lexington , with the 300-mile mark well behind us , the sky clouded over in midafternoon , mercifully tempering the oppressiveness of the heat . We were so grateful for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't notice how ominous they looked . We only wondered idly at the actions of a boatload of fishermen we came upon . They were hastily stowing their gear and cranking their outboard . They went full tilt across the river , veering toward us to shout what we later realized was a warn  --  ing . Their words were lost in the first rustle of a breeze across the water . At the moment their boat reached the shelter of the opposite shore , a thunderstorm broke with a whoop . With it came the wind . Our boat started a mad stampede for the rock-studded shore , pitching crazily in the steep waves that formed almost in  --  stantly . Tom and I jumped to the oars . We were able to claw the boat off , but only barely . As our strength frayed and we won  --  dered how long we could keep up the effort , we spotted a break in the line of stone revetment , offering a mud bank as a refuge . We let the boat scoot in and made it fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontally and tear the tops off the waves . It was impossible to tell where the rain left off and the river began . The crown of the tree to which we were tied snapped off . Other trees crashed around us . Fortunately the wind toppled them away from us . Tom , with a fine ob  --  liviousness of what was going on , got a bar of soap and went on deck for a shower in the rain . On the Missouri , one bathes as he can . In half an hour the storm stopped as suddenly as it began . Past Sheepnose , Crooked River , Tabo , Cranberry and Tamerlane bends . Past Hamlet Lower , Gumbo Point , Buckhorn Mine and John Silver lights . Tied up at night in the willows as usual , we chanced to look up at an overhanging cottonwood to see a pair of eyes glowing in the moon ? light . Tom went , " Kre-e-ee . " The animal answered . They conversed in amity and seeming understanding for several min  --  utes . Then John pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bandit 's mask of black across its eyes , looking us over . The animal retreated be  --  fore the light , but leisurely and without sign of undue fright . When we went to bed we laid a bowl of pears on the deck . In the morning the dish was empty . It was after we passed Miami and were reaching toward the 400-mile mark that we had the experience , which we had dreaded since our start , of meeting the towboat Lachlan Mackay . Although the Kansas City , itself no pigmy , had twice passed us without mishap , our apprehen  --  sion had not lessened . The Mackay was a special case . With its 3500 horsepower and its four propellers and ten rudders under the stern , it is the most powerful boat on the river . We were warned that as it went past it sucked as much as three feet of water out of the river to pile it up in angry pyramids in its wake . The passing came after we had tied up temporarily late one afternoon while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we had decided to lie there overnight when the farm 's occupants came to share our after-dinner coffee . As we sat on the warm sand talking , we no  --  ticed downstream the first faint glow in the sky that could only be the lights of the Macleay . The boat was so far away we had ample time to reflect that we were poorly prepared for what was to come . Thinking to stop only for minutes , we had pulled our boat in against a bank of sharp rock ; although we were technically out of the channel , the Mackay would go by within a matter of feet . The meeting took place with all of the river 's slow deliberateness . The boat 's glow intensified until the cottonwoods downstream were individually silhou  --  etted in its glare . The running lights of the head barge , seeming to span the entire width of the river , came into sight while the towboat , pushing its load from be  --  hind , was still hidden behind the bend . Then , the hammering of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towboat marched into view . Its searchlight nerv  --  ously fingered back and forth in the dark  --  ness , feeling for marker boards and prob  --  ing for dangers . The light brushed across our boat , halted and then came back to focus on the stern . The white end of our boat seemed to blaze up in the intensity of the beam . We could all but hear the pilot  --  Leonard Thompson , I imagine  --  exclaim , " Well , I 'll be goldurned ! " The farmer , Tom and l grasped spars and sounding poles to hold the boat off the rocks . The head of the tow moved si  --  lently past , a deep v furrow reaching back from its front to rock our boat slightly . Nine hundred feet of barges slid by and then the towboat was upon us , its diesels pounding with a din that hurt ears grown attuned to the river 's quiet . The deck hands waved a greeting , but only our womenfolk responded . We had our hands full . The suction laid bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Then the Macleay was past and the water came rushing back , seething and confused . The boat jumped around for a few minutes and then settled down . It was n't so bad as we had expected . It was ironic that when a passing boat did give us a rough time , it should be one of the smallest craft we met . The happen  --  ing took place a day or two later when we came upon the work boat Cole on a wind-lashed reach of river as , traveling fast and kicking up a good wake , it pushed an empty barge upstream . The reach was too narrow to get very far out of the Cole 's way . The wind picked up the waves of its wake and pushed them upstream , building them up as they traveled . By the time they reached us they were breaking . Our boat went crazy as I headed the bow into the waves . Down below , lanterns banged back and forth while the frying pan turned into a mad pendulum as it swung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and it was a good half hour before we quit jumping around . One wave splashed over our bow during the experi  --  ence . It was the only river water we took on deck throughout the trip . Under way for more than two weeks now , drifting had become as much of a routine as navigating the Missouri could ever be . In planning the trip , we had an  --  ticipated that when novelty wore off , boredom might follow . We had sought to safeguard ourselves against this by bring  --  ing books that had gone unread during the months of building the boat and get  --  ting ready . The novelty did wear off , of course , but the boredom never came . Our enjoyment continued undiminished . The books went unopened , save for Huck Finn . This I read to John as we drifted , and surely the setting was one to bring the book alive . We enjoyed ourselves so much that it came to worry us . The happenings of each day individually were so small that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their aggregate . We were fearful that , with too much ease and too few challenges , we had turned lazy and slothful . Yet we had no feeling of dullness . Instead , we were aware of a con  --  stant sensitivity to the scene through which we moved . We were immersed in . peace , in contentment and in tranquillity , and we felt the better for it . Serenity , we discovered , is a human need . It was in this reflective mood that we came to Glasgow , an old steamboat town that is of and by the river . Located on high bluffs lifting up from the river , it has a storybook appearance when seen from a boat , while the town is so laid out that it commands a magnificent view of the Mis  --  souri sweeping by in a huge curve . The town so fascinated us and the people were so pleasant that we laid over half a day . Below Glasgow we went into the wil  --  lows for our final camp on the Missouri . Ten miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lamine River . We planned to go five miles up the tribu  --  tary stream and there , at the Lamine River Boating Club , beach out our boat until next summer 's installment of a voy  --  age that will continue each year until , eventually , we reach New Orleans and then continue on until we run out of river at the Passes . Our final stopping place on the Mis  --  souri was fittingly attractive , with a broad shelf of bank carpeted with greenery and a backdrop of cottonwoods that rustled pleasantly . The moon had come full . There was enough breeze to keep off the mosquitoes . We sat on deck until late , re  --  luctant to close our eyes for the last time on the beauty with which we had lived for three weeks . The next morning we dawdled at get  --  ting under way , and then let the boat run as it would , hoping it would stretch out the remaining miles we had to spend on the Missouri . Perversely , it moved at a good clip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the river 's mouth we found a little cove overhung by trees and pulled in for a coffee break . It was a silent interval while we sat looking out at the river as , flexing tawny muscles always , it moved past the opening toward the sea . We had thought to find a commercial fisherman living nearby from whom we could hire a tow . There was none . Tom and I rigged a 200-foot towline and began hauling the boat upstream from the bank . In the keelboat days , the ratio was one crewman to each ton of boat . We were pulling a little more than one fourth of this load , but we found it a burden that quickly tired us . Apparently we are not the men that our predecessors were . As we were commiserating each other on what looked like a long , hard day , two men came along in a johnboat . The pair , Archie Sears and Troy Klatt , were Boon  --  ville residents who had come out for a Saturday of fishing . They took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towed us upstream to the boat club . It was when we were snugging down the boat and tidying the interior for our leave-taking that it hit us with full force how basic a part of us the river had be  --  come . " The Missouri sneaks up on you , " a pilot had told us on the way down . " Once it has you , you can never get away . " How right he was . It was with a feeling of emptiness that we came home . Now that we have returned , we are constantly aware of an element of incompletion in the pattern of our daily life . We know that we shall continue to feel that way un  --  til we can come back again . The river has us in its spell - THE END
