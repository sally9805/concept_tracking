The " sick " switchmen played out their hand to the bitter end . Some of the strikers responded to Charles Wilson 's appeal to return ( TIME , Feb. 12 ) . But it took Harry Truman 's stinging rebuke and the threat of a club to get the rest of them back and the trains running . The Army , theoretical boss of the roads since they were seized last summer , did what no private boss can do : it ordered the workers to work or be fired . <P> That did it . One of the most damaging strikes in recent years ended . <P> But the Railway Labor Act , once the model machinery for settling labor disputes through prolonged negotiation , mediation and sweet reasonableness , was a shambles . Mr. Truman was bitter , although the fact of the matter was that he himself and Franklin Roosevelt were as responsible as anyone for the wreck of the act . <P> The act had worked very well from 1934 to 1941 . Then Franklin Roosevelt upset its balanced give &; take ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the brotherhoods exactly what they were demanding . After that , the brotherhoods merely went through the act 's routine , agreed to nothing and sat back each time to wait for the generous award which they knew they could get from the Great White Father . <P> For the most part , Mr. Truman had followed the policy of Mr. Roosevelt . <P> This week , although the strike was over , nothing was really settled in a wage dispute which had been going on for almost two years . As a small sop , the Army temporarily boosted wages by half the amount the carriers had agreed to pay last December ( an amount which the brotherhoods had rejected ) . No one expected the brotherhoods to be satisfied with that . The brotherhoods smarted under their defeat , under the President 's harsh words , and , incidentally , under a federal judge 's verdict that William P. Kennedy 's Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen was in contempt of court ( $25,000 fine ) for defying a back-to-work order last December . <P> <P> One oddly bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ill-famed Long Island Rail Road , generally on the receiving end of commuters ' brickbats because of its erratic operation , kept running steadily all through the strike .
