Up on the city room bulletin board of the Nashville Tennessean went a memo last week : " The constructive , liberal policies which have characterized the Nashville Tennessean under the direction of my father will be continued ... " The statement , signed with a bold signature startlingly like that of the late publisher . Silliman Evans , was the work of Silliman Evans Jr . In accord with the " earnest desire " expressed by his father , brisk , self-assured Silliman Evans Jr. , 30 , will be come the new publisher of one of the South 's liveliest and most powerful papers . His brother , Tennessean Reporter ( and vice president ) Amon Carter Evans . 21 , named for the late publisher of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram ( TIME , July 4 ) , will become a full-time executive . But much of the day-to-day responsibility for the Tennessean ( circ. 112,947 ) will remain in the hands of Editor-Vice President Coleman Harwell , a meticulous , imaginative newsman who joined the paper 28 years ago as an unpaid cub . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained by his hard-driving father . He broke in as a printer 's devil at eight , sold newspapers on the street , learned to use a camera , did some reporting . At 18 he joined the Air Transport Command , became the ATC 's youngest wartime pilot , landed the first U.S. transport plane in liberated Paris . After the war Silliman Jr . took over two smaller dailies then owned by the company ; Both he and his brother are well aware that they must move fast to live up to their father , described in his early days as a Star-Telegram staffer as " the alltime , all-American diesel engine of Texas reporting . " <P> Truce . The elder Silliman Evans bought a controlling interest in the sick Tennessean in 1937 , promptly made a truce with James G. Stahlman 's staid evening Banner ( circ. 91,878 ) under which the papers killed competing editions , merged mechanical facilities and ad departments . By thus cutting costs , Evans soon turned his paper into a moneymaker . <P> In the Tennessean news columns , as distinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is liberally laced with national and international news and brightly written features . Evans , who always considered reporting " the most important and best job on a newspaper , " was never happier than when his staffers were digging up a political expos or spicy feature , such as the discovery of Nashville Heir Tom Buntin in Texas 22 years after he vanished with his secretary . <P> Targets . Under its New Dealing publisher ( a favorite Evans slogan : " No Republican is fit to hold public office " ) , the Tennessean hovered protectively over TVA , opposed Eisenhower mainly because Evans suspected the President did not favor further public-power expansion . <P> Not all Tennessean targets are Republican . Democratic Governor Frank Clement has been elected twice over all-out opposition from the Tennessean , which charges Clement with being a front man for his lawyer father . At the head of the editorial column , seven days a week , it runs a list of " Tennessean Firsts , " i.e. , top-priority goals , such as bringing industries to Nashville .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
