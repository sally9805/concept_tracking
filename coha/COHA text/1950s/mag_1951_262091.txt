Should U.S. history be revised-upwards ? Have U.S. historians been selling the U.S. short ? These were the questions 200 teachers and historians were discussing last week at the annual meeting of the Institute of American History . The Institute was started ten years ago by Stanford 's Edgar E. Robinson , who wanted to get scholars and teachers together . Last week , the teachers got a ringing earful from Columbia 's Historian Allan Nevins . It 's about time , said Nevins , that U.S. historians changed their tune. * <P> " We have become , first a great world power , and now , the great power . We must view the past , therefore , through this changed perspective . . . <P> " In the cynical ' 20s and ' 30s , our men of strength and stature were described as pygmies . The elder Rockefeller , Andrew Carnegie . . . Henry Ford were treated as archetypes of greed . . . Historians have underestimated their constructive work . <P> " In future histories , our industrial leaders will stand forth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming historians will realize that this era ... is one of the great hours in the history of the U.S. and English-speaking peoples , and may be invested with the heroic radiance of the Elizabethan period or the Age of Pitt . . . " <P> <P> * One new tune needed , said Librarian of Congress Luther Evans , is more military history . " As one of my colleagues at Columbia once said : ' In abandoning the drum-and-trumpet school of history , we adopted the bum-and-strumpet school . ' "
