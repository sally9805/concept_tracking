Newspaper comic strips were once considered something for the kiddies , but through the years they have reached more and more toward the adult . Li'I Abner is a backwoods peepshow , abounding in pork-fed bosoms and thighs . Steve Canyon is an illustrated primer on military chess and international intrigue . The only violence not yet committed on the ageless person of Orphan Annie is rape . Even Peanuts , a comic with its points for young and old , is often a subtle dose of child psychology . Last week a comic created and drawn just for the kiddies-and , what 's more , for kiddies too young to read-was running in eight papers ( combined circ. 2,834,068 ) , * and forcing reluctant parents to the piano and the kazoo . <P> <P> The authors of the new strip , Willie Woo , claim it is the first comic to be set to music . Each weekly sequence ends in a simple song composed by Marion Abeson , a Manhattan attorney 's wife who has sold more than 5,000,000 records of her songs for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , hands her ideas over to Freelance Artist Marvin Friedman to draw . <P> Willie 's world is designed for the three-to seven-year-old child . Older fans are welcome , but mostly as reading aides and accompanists for the songs . Artist Friedman deliberately draws Willie and his pals - Silly Sue , Moisevitch the Lion , Candy Cow , who gives striped peppermint milk - with a simplicity that his followers can copy . Willie 's adventures are unsullied by the usual comic staples of crime , violence and disrespect to elders . <P> " This comic does n't try to teach anything , " says Creator Abeson , now making plans to introduce Willie Woo on television . " I had n't thought of it as a reading aid-but we hear about teachers using Willie Woo in their classes . " This is a destiny unlikely to overtake any of Willie 's more established competitors . <P> <P> *Baltimore Sun , Boston Globe , Chicago Sun-Times , Milwaukee Journal , Houston Chronicle , Miami Herald , Jacksonville Florida Times-Union , Long Island Newsday.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
