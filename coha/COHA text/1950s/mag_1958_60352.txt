The event is very young , but it is to American devotees of road racing cars what the Kentucky Derby is to improvers of another temperamental breed . // The big event at Sebring has several distinguishing features . For one thing , it has perhaps the wordiest title in sport : The Florida International 12-Hour Grand Prix of Endurance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrivaled in sport for complexity . // True-blue road racing fans are not puzzled by this complexity . Others who do not share their information and special language frequently are . An effort will be made , then , to preview Sebring lucidly for those who have n't yet discovered its merits , and informatively for those who regularly follow racing . // Let it be said , first of all , that this should be as fine a weekend as Sebring has seen . A dozen of the 65 entries will have a reasonable chance of winning the absolute victory , largely because of the new international ceiling on engine size for the most powerful cars . Last year , one car of vastly superior horsepower and speed , the 4.5-liter Maserati , made the over-all race no contest . // The field of drivers will be first-rate , with the cream of the international corps , the best American road racers , the Indianapolis drivers Jim Rathmann and Pat O'Connor , and many talented American amateurs for whom Sebring has come to be the racing treat of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have not heretofore competed in the U.S. : Tony Brooks , Jack Fairman , Ron Flockhart , Ninian Sanderson and Archie Scott-Brown. // The field of cars will be the best yet ; the European factories which keep the sport alive have done themselves proud . This is especially true of the most powerful cars . Aston Martin of England will have a strong two-car entry captained by Stirling Moss , the best active racing driver in the world . ( The No. 1 driver , World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio , will lend his presence at Sebring but probably will not race . // Ferrari of Italy , world champion manufacturer in 1956 and 1957 and favorite to win a third consecutive title , will enter a three-car team bolstered by additional U.S.-owned Ferraris . The Ecurie Ecosse , a swashbuckling Scottish team whose D Jaguars won the premier event of this kind , the Le Mans 24-Hours , in 1956 and 1957 , will make its American bow with two D Jaguars. // The chief novelty will be two streamlined racers from the tiny English shop of Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost enthusiast , Briggs Cunningham , and his associate , Alfred Momo . Cunningham may personally drive another car from his stable , a D Jaguar . Momo will call signals for the team via a two-way radio hookup rigged by the Vocaline radio and Gentex helmet people  --  the first time this has been tried on so large a scale . // Off-course the pace will be swift , with , among other things , a ball Thursday evening and a gymkhana and cavalcade for more than 40 antique and classic cars on Friday . // A few facts should be kept in mind if Sebring is to be appreciated fully . It is , above all , a unique U.S. event  --  the only American auto race in which the stars of the international circuit compete . It is a stop on the way to one of the two great international championships  --  that for manufacturers of sports cars . The other world title is for drivers , and is campaigned for in Grand Prix ( specifically , Formula I ) cars , not sports cars . Grand Prix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " great prize , " not in its narrow sense of " all-out racing car . " // Sports cars and Grand Prix cars differ from U.S. track racing cars in that they are designed to compete on roads , or simulated roads , rather than on elliptical tracks . Gearboxes and brakes are of secondary importance on track cars ; they are vital in road racing . This is especially true of brakes at Sebring , because its 5.2 miles of airport runway and adjacent road , with long straights and sharp turns , make the world 's most severe test of brakes . // A Grand Prix car is easy to spot , because it has cockpit space for a driver only and usually has no fenders . Sports cars come in two main varieties  --  the kind that can be driven in ordinary traffic , and the kind designed only to be raced . Both types must have fenders , headlights and spare tires . The cars shown on page 35 are good examples of all-out sports racing cars . At Sebring these are called sports cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are called grand touring cars . The murderous thing about keeping all this straight is that these broad categories are further broken down into 11 separate classes , according to engine size . There are winners in these classes as well as one absolute winner , and there is , as well , a handicap winner . This is the car that rates best on a mathematical formula that is designed to put small cars on an equal footing with larger ones . // Classification by engine size is auto racing 's equivalent of the scale of weights in prizefighting . Ferraris and the like are heavyweights , Porsches middleweights , etc . Engine size is always measured in road racing under the European metrical system . The cars shown are 3-liter racers , because the pistons of each operate through a total volume of 3 liters . A liter equals 1,000 cubic centimeters or 61 cubic inches or , for those who visualize poorly , about one Martini more than a quart . This is the favorite illustration of Art Peck , a sports car evangelist who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Cronkite and Peck will broadcast a 15-minute Sebring preview at 9:30 p.m . Friday ; a five-minute report at 9:55 a.m. on race day ; 10-minute progress reports at 1:30 , 4:05 , 6:05 and 8:35 p.m. ; and the results from 10:05 to 10:25 p.m . All times are Eastern Standard . There will be race bulletins on CBS-radio hourly network newscasts. // Ferrari is the team to beat at Sebring , and Peter Collins and Phil Hill are the pair to watch . Limited to a maximum displacement of 3 liters in the championship race by the new rules , Enzo Ferrari has plucked the 3-liter V-12 engine from his very fast touring car , souped it up to 300 hp and placed it in a superb lightweight chassis for maximum effect . Two of these " 250TR " cars placed one-two in the first round for the manufacturers ' title , in Argentina in January , with Collins and Hill in the winner . // There is no doubt about Collins ' ability to drive fast ; there are some reservations about his ability to conserve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening laps that he all but used up his brakes . The Briton 's teammate is California 's best driver and one of the very best Americans . Factory Drivers Wolfgang von Trips and Mike Hawthorn in a second 250TR and Luigi Musso and Olivier Gendebien in a third make the " prancing horse " formidable indeed . Domestic support comes from John von Neumann and Richie Ginther , John Fitch and Ed Martin , and Chet Flynn and Ed Hugus , all in 250TR models . // NO CINCH FOR FERRARIS // The Ferraris will be given absolutely no respite by the Aston Martin DBR1s . Moss and the sensational young Briton , Tony Brooks , are paired in what could well be the overall winner . Britain 's steady Roy Salvadori and the brilliant American , Carroll Shelby , will drive the other DBR1. // Britain 's Archie Scott-Brown , an old Lister hand , will share one of Cunningham 's Lister-Jaguars with the American , Walt Hansgen , winner of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED 'S 1957 U.S. Sports Car Driver award . The other will be driven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another fast American , Ed Crawford. // The Lister-Jaguars and the standard D Jaguars of the Ecurie Ecosse will have the famed Jaguar XK 6-cylinder engine , with the length of the stroke cut down to fit the new regulation . // Salty Dave Murray , chief of the Scottish team , will show off his Le Mans winners , Ron Flockhart and Ivor Bueb , along with Ninian Sanderson , Jack Fairman and the very rapid American , Masten Gregory . // Now that Maserati has officially quit racing its cars will not be great threats . Two private 3-liter models have an outside chance . // Prodigies have been performed in the past by the ultralight , small-engined Porsche Spyders . At Sebring two of the latest 1,600-cc. models will get expert handling from Jean Behra , last year 's co-winner with Fangio , Harry Shell , Richard von Franken-berg and Edgar Barth . // No wonder , then , that there are great expectations for Sebring . Its 12 hours should have enough sis-boom-bah for a dozen races .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
