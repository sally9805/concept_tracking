Before the Southern Governors ' Conference in 1951 , a bushy-haired , boyish-looking newsman stood up and spoke unpalatable truths . Said he : " We can not turn our backs upon injustice simply because a black man is its victim . Nor can we find a safe retreat in the sort of legalistic buck-passing that recognizes the existence of an evil but insists it is somebody else 's responsibility . " <P> Six years later , Harry Scott Ashmore 's words came home to roost-right on his own shoulders . In his post as executive editor of the Arkansas Gazette , he stood out last week as the strong voice for principle and reason in Little Rock and a central figure in the integration crisis . <P> Public Enemy No . I. Day after day , rumpled , greying Harry Ashmore , 41 , turned out some of the most eloquent editorials of his distinguished career , supplied guidance and a stream of wisecracks for impatient newsmen from all over the world , briefed Government official on critical developments . Twice he scurried up to Manhattan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at work in the South . <P> Through the turmoil . Harry Ashmore 's telephone shrilled around the clock with threatening calls from agitators , who were fired by Governor Faubus ' cry that Editor Ashmore was the worst of all possible culprits , " an ardent integrationist . " Little Rock 's white-supremacist Capital Citizens ' Council ( annual dues : $5 ) dubbed Ashmore " Public Enemy No. i . " Eagerly abetted by some less scrupulous competitors , a statewide boycott against " that nigger-lovin ' paper " had cost the 137-year-old Gazette ( circ. 99,573 ) 3,000 subscribers by week 's end . <P> Bar Raillery . With the solid support of J. ( for John ) N. Heiskell , 84-year-old president of the sturdily Democratic Gazette , Editor Ashmore emphasized from the day of the Supreme Court 's school-integration ruling in 1954 that there could be " no choice between compliance and defiance . " Far from urging integration , the Gazette , which had helped elect Orval Faubus in two gubernatorial campaigns , backed his efforts to postpone desegregation by " moderate , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legalistic buck-passing to outright defiance , Harry Ashmore 's conscience-pricking editorials ( more than 40 so far ) repeatedly warned of the tragic consequences . When the mobs moved into the streets around Central High School , it was to Democratic Editor Ashmore that U.S. Deputy Attorney General William P. Rogers telephoned for a precise estimate of the strength of the forces of moderation . " I told him , " drawled Ashmore. " that about all our side had left was a broken-down editor , a lame-duck mayor and a former governor who has no public office . "
