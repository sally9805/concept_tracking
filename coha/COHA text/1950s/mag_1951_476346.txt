IN AUGUST 1946 a dry lightning storm , a thunderstorm without rain , started a fire in a remote part of the Boise National Forest in Idaho . Two fires which were burning at the time had strained the defenses of the forest but the fire-control officials started toward the new one as many men as could be spared , rented bulldozers from the nearest contracting firms , and sent out an emergency call for firefighters . You do not extinguish a forest fire . You make a fire line round it , clearing away brush , stumps , and the decayed organic matter that is called duff till you reach soil or rock , and hope to hold it within the line . Firefighters equipped with shovels , saws , and axes patrol the line , felling dead trees ( " snags " ) on both sides of it , putting out small spot fires that have been started by sparks blown beyond it , rolling old logs out of the way , and starting back-fires if they are called for . Violent winds made the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second day it had burned some three hundred acres of timber . By the fifth day 361 men were fighting it and sixty others were on their way toward it . Rain is almost unheard of in August in central Idaho but on the sixth morning there was a short fall and the fire was promptly brought under control . It had burned about seven hundred acres , destroyed about $2,000 worth of timber , and cost $37,000 to fight . Both size and expensewere trivial , considering the possibilities of a fire that had got so dangerous a start . A 1931 fire in the Boise Forest burned some 35,000 acres . On the second day plans were made to construct a line well back from the one which the fire had been blown across . Part of it would run along a ridge separated from the base camp by a number of gulches where there were no trails and which men and equipment would therefore take a long time to cross . Ordering bulldozers to start making a trail toward it , the fire boss radioed a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land on the ridge , construct the line there , and hold it till they could be reached in force . A small unit of smokejumpers was based at McCall , Idaho , fifty miles away in an air line , but all of them had been dispatched to three fires in the Payette National Forest . Missoula , Montana , 150 miles away by air and the headquarters of the Forest Service 's system of aerial fire control , therefore answered the request with twenty smokejumpers in two Ford trimotor planes . Long obsolete for other kinds of flying , the old Tin Goose remains the only large plane that can do the kind of work necessary in these operations . I first saw smokejumpers in action on this occasion . I was staying in the Boise Forest , getting extensive and for a man of sedentary tastes very strenuous instruction in Various aspects of forestry . When I reached the ridge the smokejumpers had already landed there and were setting up a rough camp some distance down the reverse slope , but a Ford was circling the site dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with additional supplies . To be under those drops was a spectacular and exhilarating experience . I took shelter under a tall Ponderosa pine , for these were pinpoint bombers and in 1946 the Service dropped more packs without parachutes than it does now . The bedrolls came down that way , hitting with a thump that sounded like a bomb explosion and bouncing high in the air . ( I doubt if the Ford was ever less than two hundred feet off the ground , which was practically stratosphere flying compared to what I saw this year . ) When a parachute carrying supplies lodged in a tree , a smokejumper put on a pair of climbing-irons and went after it , if it looked as if it could be easily cleared . If it did n't , one or two chopped down the tree . Landing in a tree was desirable for it broke the force of the fall ? the smokejumpers themselves like to land in timber unless it is very high ? and the Service had worked out ingenious methods of packing to prevent breakage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree and dropped its load , which must have been imperfectly lashed . Part of the load was a crate of eggs , which hit the ground with a soul-satisfying splash . A single egg , however , rolled end over end downhill for an incredible distance and then came to rest unbroken . Smokejumpers are simply firefighters who reach fires from the air . As soon as they had set up their camp , they got to work clearing the line along the ridge . A portable radio kept them in touch with the fire boss , the base camp , and a small plane that was reconnoitering the fire . They worked till dark but soon after they started again the next morning the bulldozers and a crew from the base camp reached the ridge and took over . The smokejumpers headed for the nearest road . They left all their equipment to be brought out by a packer and his mule-string and forwarded to Missoula . They themselves would travel out of the forest by truck and return to Missoula by bus or train . T HIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great value to the Forest Service is that they can get to a fire much faster than any other firefighters . If he reaches it early enough one man can control a forest fire with a shovel or an axe or even by stamping on it . Many areas of the Western forests are a long way from a road or even a trail , in exceedingly rugged mountain wilderness . I have seen fires that were not reached until the third day and know of some that have required longer . At the end of such a period a fire may be so big that hundreds of men will be needed ? and , traveling a large part of the way on foot , they may be exhausted when they get there . Whereas the smokejumpers can travel up to 160 miles an hour and so can reach nearly any fire in less than two hours ? though Missoula will send them distances of up to four hours ' flying time ? and will be as fresh when they land as when they started . Commonly , therefore , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Region One of the Forest Service ? Montana , northern Idaho , and parts of Washington and South Dakota ? has compiled some impressive figures about the saving that results . From 1905 , when the Forest Service was organized , to 1930 , the forests of this Region suffered an average annual loss from fire of 252,000 acres , worth at present-day prices $40,000,000 on the stump ( there are four other Regions in the arid West ) , and the average rate of travel toward fires was two and a half miles an hour . In the next decade , because the building of roads and trails in the forests had made possible more extensive use of trucks , the average rate of travel was fifteen miles an hour and the annual loss dropped to 65,200 acres , worth $3,500,000 . In the decade from 1940 , the year when the small beginnings of smokejumping were made , to 1950 the average annual loss in Region One was 8,888 acres worth $350,000 , and fires were reached at a speed that ranged between 80 and 160 miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Region One was $171,624 . Assuming the average annual loss of the preceding decade , this expenditure saved the public $3,150,000 . The figures , moreover , cover only the stumpage value of burned timber . In a big fire other losses may total far more : destruction of cattle , sheep , game animals , and other wild life and impairment of grazing ranges ; alteration of soil chemistry with subsequent degradation of new growth ; impairment of watersheds which may mean floods , damage to farmlands and to dams , irrigation systems , and city water systems ; destruction of many kinds of public and private property , such as amusement and recreation areas , summer camps and cabins , resort hotels , ranch buildings , sawmills and stacked lumber , road-making equipment , railroad trackage and cars . The Forest Service began dropping supplies to remote fires as early as 1929 . Though it has a few small planes of its own , which it uses for reconnaissance , survey , and search , practically all the flying connected with actual firefighting is done on contract by private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flying Service of Missoula , owned and operated by the famous Western pilot Bob Johnson , has had an extremely important part in the development of aerial control . By 1936 Mr. Johnson and Forest Service experts had developed what is called the static line , a device which opens parachutes automatically and so relieves the jumper of responsibility for what had previously been the most uncertain and dangerous part of his jump . It made the Army 's use of paratroopers possible . Two years later the same collaborators developed a quick-opening chute which could be steered and maneuvered more effectively than any before it . The Service made its first experiments with parachute jumpers at the end of the fire season of 1939 . The first jumps to actual forest fires were made in 1940 . In that year too a board of Army officers studied the training system which the Service had worked out ; as a result it became the basis of the training given to paratroops . The smokejumping program was expanded during the war years and later . In 1949 the Service had 252 smokejumpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small subbases in Idaho , and one each in Washington , Oregon , California , and New Mexico . They made a total of 1,335 individual jumps to 354 fires . Unusual weather conditions in the West made 1950 a comparatively easy year and the total number of jumps was less than half as large . The MAGAZINE figures of 1951 are not in as I write but it has been a bad fire year . V ERY few smokejumpers are permanent Forest Service employees , for the work is seasonal . All of them are young and many are college undergraduates . The pay is preposterously low but since they get overtime after eight hours they may make as much as $450 a month . The training course , which precedes the fire season , lasts three weeks and concentrates on precision jumping , though it also includes physical conditioning and instruction in firefighting . It is obviously effective . Although smokejumpers are used only in country so difficult and dangerous that the Army would never use parachuters there at all except on rescue missions , none has ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrequent . During 1950 , for instance , on the 188 jumps made to fifty fires in Region One there were three injuries serious enough to take the victims off the job . One man suffered a broken ankle , another a broken rib and some strained back muscles , and the third an ankle-strain that incapacitated him for just one day . At Missoula this was considered a depressingly poor record for the year . Not only the training program accounts for such extraordinary success but the aerial techniques and the equipment which the Service and its civilian collaborators have developed . The two-piece jumping suit ? which on long flights is not put on till within a few minutes of the fire ? is made of canvas and is padded with felt . Straps of webbing secure the legs under the jumper 's boots and the jacket has a high stiff collar flaring back from the neck to protect him from tree-branches . A pocket on the right leg holds streamers of brightcolored cloth for signaling to the plane and from 65 to 125 feet of rope . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he has made his favorite landing in a tree . He hitches it to the lines of the chute , unbuckles the harness , and slides down . Underneath the suit he wears a belt of heavy webbing with stiff leather braces front and back . He also wears an ordinary football helmet , a mask of heavy steel wire , gloves , and logger 's boots , which are heavier than those worn by paratroopers . He has an emergency chest-chute with easily detachable harness ; a sheathed knife is attached to its under side . His main chute of course is on his back and is attached by the static line to a steel cable above the door of the plane. * So clad , the jumper simply steps sideward out the door of the Ford or from a metal step riveted below the door to the side of such single-engined planes as Travelairs . He straightens his legs and back so that he will hang erect and crosses his arms till he has cleared the plane and the chute has opened . He takes no equipment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed . All parachutes are made of nylon , which besides being more substantial and more easily packed than silk is unpalatable to grasshoppers . Personal chutes , which are used in rotation , no jumper being permitted a private one , are specialty made for the Forest Service ; cargo chutes are Army surplus . III I N AUGUST of this year I spent ten days in Missoula , lecturing at the State University of Montana . It was , as I have said , a bad fire year . In my first seven days Region One had 215 fires , to 51 of which jumpers were dispatched , making 190 individual jumps . Resolved to see a smokejumping operation from the air if possible , I went to Hale Field , the private airport of the Johnson Flying Service , met Mr. Johnson , and got his permission to accompany a flight if smokejumpers should be called for at a time when I was not busy at the university . Bob Johnson was one of the original group , and is one of the few survivors , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more dangerous flying in the world and none that requires more skill . Treacherous and unpredictable winds , violent updrafts and downdrafts , the liability of sudden storms are everpresent hazards . In the summer the air above peaks and canyons is so turbulent during the daytime that except in emergencies even these treetop pilots are reluctant to fly between midmorning and late afternoon . ( All forest fires are emergencies and most flights to them are made during the worst hours . ) There are few landing strips and so emergency landings are all but impossible . Instrument * See photograph on page 19. flying is mostly out of the question , and in any event there is no substitute for the skill and knowledge required by the special circumstances , one trouble being that a man may lose his life while acquiring them . Conditions are even worse when fall and winter storms set in ; a biography of Mr. Johnson would be a succession of hair-raising stories of bravery , risk-taking , danger , and escape . Since a book about him and his associates is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying and talking with him I was convinced , as hundreds before me had been , that he is one of the great pilots . On my first Saturday , Forest Service officials showed me the training installation twentyodd miles from Missoula and the parachute loft and equipment sheds at Hale Field . I also went through the Johnson Flying Service shops . It is engaged in a general flying business , of which its Forest Service contracts are only a part , and mountain flying demands the best possible maintenance . There can be no engine failures ? so at Hale Field engines are torn down and rebuilt after only half as many hours as the standards of the CAA require . The Johnson Service owns three Ford trimotors which it uses ( besides smaller planes ) in its smokejumping contract . The great value of the Ford is that it is the only large plane which can be landed on short strips in the bottom of canyons and , though large , it can be flown slow enough to permit parachute jumps in mountain terrain but has power enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain replacement parts and so they are all made at Hale Field . Since the youngest of these three planes was made in 1929 presumably no part of the original engines is left . Twice while I was at the field on Saturday smokejumpers were despatched to fires but in single-engine planes which they and their equipment filled , leaving no room for me . Fords went out twice the next day but I was off in the back country of the Bitterroot Mountains , photographing sites on the trail of Lewis and Clark . On Monday afternoon , however , I was summoned to the field . A fire had been reported in the Lolo National Forest , in an area which I had crossed the day before , and smokejumpers were being sent to it in a Ford . Mr. Johnson himself was going to pilot the plane . T HE fire ? always called a " smoke " when reported ? was fifty-five miles in an air line from Missoula , on the side of a canyon in the Bitterroots . It had probably been started by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single dead stump or snag until today , when it reached the duff of the forest floor . It had been sighted at 1:52 P.m. by a Forest Service lookout in a fire tower on a peak some miles away . He had needed just eight minutes to locate it on his map , check his observations and calculations , and report it by Forest Service telephone to fire-control headquarters in Missoula . Smokejumpers had been ordered to it because the nearest place from which any other firefighters could be sent was a ranger station in the same canyon but fifteen miles from the smoke , too great a distance to be covered that afternoon . The lookout had reported it as " a large spot , burning on a gentle slope , " which meant that it was still very small . Normally therefore only two smokejum.pers would have been sent but the map showed that it was burning near what the Service calls heavy fuel , in this case an area studded with windfalls and snags . To make sure that it would be stopped short of such highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of them were veterans of a year 's experience , the other two were in their first season . Besides them there was the man in charge of the jump , known as the spotter , and since he had just been promoted to this crucial job , in fact would be in full control for the first time , a " check-spotter " of long experience went along to keep an eye on him . An observer from Region One headquarters , Mr. Johnson the pilot , and I completed the party . When I reached the field the last equipment was being stowed in the plane ? forward from the door , the jumpers ' chutes were aft of it . Fire-control headquarters had provided maps for the pilot and the two spotters. ringing with colored pencil marks the quarter-section ? a square with half-mile sides ? in which the smoke had been located . But none of them really needed maps ; the whole enormous forest was as familiar to them as their own backyards . We took off at 2:30 , exactly thirty minutes after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longcanyon in which the fire was burning we flew across successive ridges of the Bitterroots . Though I have known those mountains for a long time I had never acquired so vivid an appreciation of their wildness and ruggedness as a few minutes of flight gave me now . When we reached the canyon we gave up air-line flight in order to follow its innumerable twists and turns . The memorably clear Lochsa River , part of the headwaters of the Clearwater River , was a shining ribbon at the bottom of the canyon and turned Mr. Johnson 's thoughts to trout-fishing . I was sufficiently occupied with the flight itself ; since he later described it to me as " mediocre " I will merely call it absorbing . I have indeed had rougher rides on passenger planes but hardly in circumstances so , well , stimulating . At one point Mr. Johnson pointed to the altimeter ; an updraft had taken us up a thousand feet in less than a minute . This , however , was gentle stuff ; pilots frequently have to manhandle the plane by main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a flight . And the sky was cloudless and there were no storms within hundreds of miles . Perhaps there was more motion back of the nose , where I was occupying the co-pilot 's seat , but / suspect that a psychological element helped to make one of the veteran jumpers sick . These young men are entirely nonchalant and businesslike . They have complete and justified confidence in their skill , training , and equipment , and everyone in the Service assures me that from the first few days of training on fear is no problem . Yet there must always be some unconscious anxiety ? considering the cliffs , the rock slopes , and the treacherous air , how could there help being ? It was interesting that when the spotter decided that two jumpers would be enough . one of those passed over by the decision got sick . Forty-five minutes after the take-off we sighted a thin column of smoke rising desultorily from a place about two-thirds the way down the canyon slope . Five minutes later we were over it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Douglas fir , big , tall trees ? too tall , in the spotter 's judgment . It had not of course reached the crowns of the trees but was burning in the duff ; the gray , burned-over spot looked about the size of a handkerchief . Mr. Johnson estimated it at a quarter of an acre , the size of a small building-lot . We had demonstrated the entire function of the smokejumpers : an hour and twenty-eight minutes after the lookout first sighted the smoke we had reached it . Our first run over it showed the spotter that it was sufficiently small and sufficiently distant from the highly inflammable dead timber to be handled by two men . He named the veterans . I THINK that his silent critic , the check-spotter , may have picked a landing place for the jumpers on that first run . Our man , however , was making sure ? when I later complimented him on his success he said adequately , " We do n't get much room for mistakes . " So we circled the fire three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements except that he thought the timber too high to be landed in , I saw several places that I thought feasible and silently chose a bare spot of slope which I thought not too steep , perhaps half a mile and somewhat uphill from the smoke . The spotter , however , had seen a small opening in the trees somewhat downhill from it and perhaps a quarter of a mile away . It was a clear space about as large as the fire , a quarter of an acre , and level except at one edge where it began to slope upward . As we completed the third circle he made his decision and directed Mr. Johnson to go down to about 1,400 feet . This intensified a spectator 's interest in the flight for it brought us below the ridges and one saw iust how narrow and twisting the canyon was . The spotter , wearing a chute and standing at the open door with one arm hooked over a short length of rail , was directing the pilot by hand-signal , motioning right or left for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our next circle he released a brightly colored drift chute to determine the strength and direction of the air currents . Its angled , gliding descent was unintelligible to me but it told the spotter that he had been off the target when he dropped it and we circled again so that he could send down another one on a different approach . When it landed and collapsed he nodded ; this one was right . The two jumpers had been squatting at the other side of the door , the static lines of their chutes connected to the cable above it . Thespotter had minutely inspected their dress and chutes and had pointed out the place selected for their landing every time we crossed it . Now they stood up , raised the masks over their faces , made sure again that the static lines were not fouled , and were ready . S UDDENLY it was one of those moments charged with tension and a kind of beauty when the thinking , planning , and skill of many men come together for a single , irrevocable act . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a joint effort . Spotter , jumpers , pilot , training , equipment , experience ? it was the instant of total commitment . I was awaxe of everyone 's poised intentness and then an indescribable excitement rose in me . The pilot was following the same course as on the last run , watching over his shoulder for the spotter 's signals . He throttled down the engines . Then when the spotter 's arm swept down in a violent chopping motion he cut them entirely . The spotter rapped the first jumper on the shoulder . He stepped out and down and was followed at once by the other one . I saw only that they ducked their heads as they went through the door . I thrust my own head through the window beside me , having previously been warned by Mr. Johnson to take off my glasses , and saw the chutes opening as he gunned the engines . Before the tail cut off my view I snapped a picture of them , achieving as it turned out an excellent record of half the window frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take forever and they seemed alternately to be motionless and to be traveling at express speed . I could not read the angles of their glide and as they neared the ground I several times thought they were in the treetops which it had been the spotter 's design to avoid . I could see , however , that they were manipulating the slotted chutes and , with a final curving swoop , one after the other they came out between the trees to the minute clear space . One landed running , the other rolled and stood up . I could see them freeing themselves from the chute-harness and even before they made the okay signal ? waving their colored streamers ? everyone in the plane knew that the jump was a success . I had a firm hold on my camera . But , I found , my glasses , exposure meter , adapterslide , notebook , and pencil were scattered about the nose . Someone in the co-pilot 's seat had been a little flustered. ry F OLLOWING the jump the pilot takes charge and gives directions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropper . " We completed the circle we had been making in order to watch the jumpers ' descent . ( If either of them had been injured the other would have so signaled with a streamer , presumably the other two jumpers would have been sent down , and a radio message would have been sent to Missoula ordering out the Johnson helicopter which can land on a dime or hover over it . ) We began another circle for the first cargo drop . On that first run we dropped two fire packs , each of which contained a sleeping bag , a personal kit , three days ' rations , a messkit , compass , maps , shoulder-pack frame , shovel , and pulaski . ( The last is a special firefighting tool , a combination axe and sharp-edged grub hoe , named for its inventor . ) If a radio had been dropped it would have been lashed between these two packs for greater protection . On the next run we dropped a five-gallon can of drinking water . These all went down by chute but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the third run had only a long cloth streamer to break its fall . One of the cargo chutes had lodged in a tree and the jumpers signaled for climbingirons by arranging four of their colored streamers on the ground in the form of a square . ( The manual calls it an 0 . ) So we circled again and dropped a pair , also bound to a plank and attached to a streamer . The spotter made these drops on Mr. Johnson 's shouted command but I did not watch their descent , my interest in flying having been poignantly stepped up . Cargo drops are made at the lowest altitude that will insure the opening of the chutes , which like the personal chutes have static lines . That altitude turned out to be remarkably slight and the plane liked to drift still lower after the drop . Mr. Johnson approached his chosen release point at what seemed to me a steep angle and I had never before been so intimate with treetops . He cut the engines and yelled , " Let her go ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , the plane sank noticeably , and the engines roared as we pulled out . Now not only were we neighboring with the trees but the wall of the canyon seemed to be less than spitting-distance ahead of us . I suppose that from some angles daylight would have been visible between the plane and the mountainside as we slid up it , but until the wing rose for the turn not much daylight . It must have been the creative imagination that made me smell friction . I asked Mr. Johnson how far above the trees we had been when he gunned the engines . He said , fifteen to twenty feet . I said that by careful , detached calculation I made it somewhat less . " Well , " he said , " call it eight or ten feet . " It was 3:55 when we dropped the climbing irons on our fourth cargo run . We made one more circle to be sure that nothing was needed below . If anything had been needed the jumpers would have signaled for it with their streamers . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message attached to a streamer would have been dropped from the plane . And if this had been a bigger fire he would have radioed an estimate of its size , of its probable extension , and of the force needed to fight it , and the fire-control headquarters at Missoula would have been drawing up a plan of action and designating men and equipment before we got back to the field . Since everything was in order , however , we turned homeward after the last precautionary circle . There being no need to follow the canyon now , we climbed out of it and flew across lots . We landed at Hale Field at about 4:30 , two hours after the takeoff , two and a half after the fire had been reported . I HAVE specified the times because they tell the story and carry its moral . Because of the speed with which they reached the fire , the smokejumpers had it under control before dark . ( They would clear a Line around it , fell any nearby snags and any small stuff within the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt on the burning duff wherever they could . The shovel is the principal tool in firefighting . ) They stayed on it the next day till sure that it was out . ( Meanwhile a patrol from the ranger station reached them , .. 10. =11tEM1-= and the job would be inspected and checked again by the packer who came in for their equipment . ) Only negligible damage had been done and the fire had been suppressed at minimum expense . The jump would not have been made if the ground wind had exceeded thirty miles an hour . Several days earlier a flight found such conditions at a fire in the Mission Range north of Missoula and returned to the field , then went back again in late afternoon when the wind had fallen . Similarly , jumps are not made if the terrain is found to be too difficult . In 1946 I saw a plane on two successive days repeatedly circle a fire that was burning high on one of the peaks of the Sawtooth Mountains and turn back without dropping smokejumpers because no safe landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded it . Aerial control is the most effective technique for fighting forest fires ever developed and the smokejumpers are its cornerstone . They have become indispensable to firefighting throughout the West and in its most arid and difficult areas , as in Region One , they are the principal means of attack , the spearhead , the basis on which all other methods rest . They are one of the most remarkable achievements of the Forest Service , which has had many remarkable achievements . I have sufficiently indicated the saving they have made possible in the protection of a precious national resource . ( Well , one more instance . While I was in Missoula twenty smokejumpers and fifteen other firefighters suppressed a fire in the Bitterroot Forest that had got a much better start than the one I have described , at a total expense of $2,000 . In 1945 a fire in the same forest to which smokejumpers were not sent , burning in similar timber and under almost identical conditions , destroyed a thousand acres and cost $70,000 . ) They have spectacular incidental use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , and in the search for people who have got lost or planes that have crashed in the mountains . And their importance for defense must not be ignored . During the war the Forest Service trained Army , Navy , and Canadian personnel for search and rescue work in the wilderness ; it has been training Canadians and Australians this year . I T OPERATES under the considerable handicap of a congressional tendency to choose queer places to economize . The parachute loft and equipment sheds at Missoula are old CCC shacks which can barely be kept rainproof . They are firetraps and if the stables of the fair grounds across the road from them were to catch fire in a moderate breeze all smokejumping operations would be automatically suspended for a year while equipment was being replaced . ( Thus insuring in Region One alone a loss of three and a half million dollars , nearly four times what it would cost to modernize the installation . ) Furthermore , various parts of the plant are scattered about Missoula at inconvenient distances , the barracks for the smokejumpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire-control headquarters in a third . And housing developments are reaching out from town to surround Hale Field . Plans have been drawn for a new plant , ample , modern , and efficient throughout and concentrating everything at a new field on the edge of the municipal airport at Missoula . Land , building , and equipment would cost just under a million dollars , a third of the annual saving in Region One . A bill appropriating the necessary money met determined opposition Iast year and could not get by a Congress which appropriated more than half a billion dollars for dams in the West ? some of them of very questionable utility and none of them destined to return the investment . This year a similar bill has at last been reported out of committee . The most elementary bookkeeping shows that to pass it would save a lot of money which , if no other use should be found for it , could be put into dams .                   @ @
