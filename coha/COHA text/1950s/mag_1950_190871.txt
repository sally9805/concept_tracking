Scholarly Dr. Bruno Pontecorvo , 37 , was well-liked by his fellow nuclear physicists at Britain 's Harwell atomic research plant . The Italian-born Briton was jolly and fun-loving , a good dancer , an enthusiastic tennis player . His pretty Swedish wife Helena Marianne was just as gay , had a flair for flamboyant clothes , including red slacks . <P> A Rome University Ph.D. , a pupil of famed Enrico Fermi , Physicist Pontecorvo fled Italy in the 1930s to escape Mussolini 's Hitler-inspired antiSemitism . He spent some time in France and the U.S. , finally settled in Canada , where he became a British subject and an important researcher at the Chalk River atomic project . Eventually he made his way to Harwell , where he rose to the post of chief scientific officer . Like many a colleague , he was an associate ( in Canada ) of Dr. Allan Nunn May , later convicted of passing atomic information to Russian agents ; and an associate ( in Britain ) of Dr. Klaus Fuchs , also convicted of atomic spying for Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned from Harwell to take a post at the University of Liverpool , which has one of Britain 's finest atomic research departments . He was doing work on tritium , key element for the hydrogen bomb ; he was also keenly interested in cosmic ray research . Before going to Liverpool , Pontecorvo planned a holiday . <P> " Is That Russia ? " With his wife &; three children , the physicist went to visit his parents in Milan . A friend who met him there asked if they were going straight back to England . " No , " said Pontecorvo . " I 'm going to Austria , where petrol is cheaper . " But he never showed up in Austria . <P> Later , it was reported , he had met a Czech and an Italian ( both unidentified ) near Lake Como . " I dare not go back , " he said to his wife . " I should be sent to prison if I did . " Without telling his parents , he and his family went to Rome . He put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank of petrol , said he 'd be back next day to start a long trip . But he never came back . <P> Instead , the Pontecorvos bought tickets via Scandinavian Airlines to Stockholm . From Stockholm , without calling Mrs. Pontecorvo 's mother , who lives in a suburb of the Swedish capital , they quickly flew on to Helsinki . During the trip , one of their little sons prattled to a fellow passenger , " We 're going to Russia . " When the youngster saw land below after crossing the Baltic , he asked , " Is that Russia ? " <P> At Helsinki 's Malmi Airport , Mrs. Pontecorvo looked haggard and distraught . Her husband seemed quite normal . But his passport was not in order ; he had no Finnish visa , so the authorities politely told him he must surrender it for correction . He could pick it up in three days at the Ministry of Interior 's Bureau for Foreigners . <P> All this delayed the airline bus into the Finnish capital . Finally the five Pontecorvos piled in , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the city , the Pontecorvo boy asked again , " Are we now in Russia ? " Just outside the Finnish Airways office in the Esplanade , the bus stopped . The Pontecorvos picked up a taxicab and sped off . After that , no trace .
