Compulsion ( dramatized from Meyer Levin 's novel ) re-enacts , exhaustively and explicitly , one of the grisliest horror stories of the century-the Loeb-Leopold murder case . Told in 20 scenes and lasting some three and a half hours , Compulsion begins just after two young homosexuals have , with long-calculated wantonness , killed a 14-year-old boy . There follow revelations of self-styled supermen who had dreamed of committing a perfect crime ; of gay , violent , vicious Artie Straus ( Richard Loeb ) and his " superior slave , " Judd Steiner ( Nathan Leopold ) ; of how imperfect a crime the two had actually committed ; of their dissension as danger looms , their behavior as detection narrows ; of the fantasy worlds in which both had lived . There is finally the trial , with the prosecution flaunting the atrocious nature of the crime , and the defense the compulsive pathology of the criminals . <P> The jagged , episodic structure of Compulsion constantly stresses the factual , historical , documentary nature of the narrative . It no less constantly ' proclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrify as theater-and the weakness , its inability to widen and deepen as drama . The cause is less the usual documentary one , that truth tends to be formless , than that in Compulsion truth lacks a spacious enough frame of reference . <P> Friedrich Hebbel , 19th century German dramatist , perhaps put his finger on why Compulsion fails to be large and liberating drama when he said that in a good play everyone must seem in the right . For the two killers this is impossible , less because of how hideous their crime is than how gratuitous : it lacks an understandably human motive . Clinically , the crime can be explained : given a lawless Jazz Age , two badly spoiled , rich men 's sons , a homosexual neurosis and a Nietzschean intellectual arrogance , and such a chemical mixture may explode into murder-for-a-thrill . But the case-and its causes - remain too special to expand into identifiable bedevilment in man 's fate . It is Grand Guignol in real life .               @ @ @ @ @ @
