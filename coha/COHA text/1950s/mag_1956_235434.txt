Merrill 's Marauders <P> Sir : <P> As a former president of the Merrill 's Marauders Association , I wish to thank TIME for its excellent tribute to our late commander , General Frank Merrill Dec. 26 . General Vlerrill 's name will be proclaimed in military history not only for his military accomplishments but also for the affection borne him by his " boys . " No army commander was ever better loved by his troops . <P> I resent your closing statement about the ' inglorious " end of the Marauders . As one of the medical officers , I can vouch for the undying bravery of every Marauder in Burma . In a conversation with the late General Merrill , the former commander of the Japanese forces opposing him in Burma stated that the Japanese so respected the Marauders that they decorated the graves of the American dead with flowers . <P> <P> A.

Have your writer read the tribute Pius XII paid the angelic Fra back in April . Angelico was more than a luminous knothole on the renaissance or a polychrome peephole on the Gospel . He was a window on Heaven . TIME brought us to the window , but a murky pane gave us a dim view of the wholeness , harmony , radiance beyond . <P> <P> THE REV . L. C. McHuGH , S.J. <P> <P> Georgetown University Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Opening an exhibition in Rome to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Fra Angelico 's death ( TIME , May 2 ) , Pope <P> Pius XII called him " an outstanding painter characterized by deep spirituality , an innovator , sympathetic , effective , sincere , perfect .
