When Becky was born four months ago , life seemed to be smiling on Accountant John H. Haire Jr . and his wife . They had a home outside Memphis , near the airport . They had two healthy boys , aged 7 and 2 . The new dark-haired baby girl rounded out their family . Becky was bright and alert : soon her blue eyes seemed to be following as her mother walked across the room . <P> Recently Becky began to rub her eyes alot . The Haires took her first to a pediatrician , then to an eye specialist , who called in eight others . Their verdict : Becky 's ears , not her eyes , had followed her mother 's movements . Becky had been born blind , apparently with cancer . <P> Once , parents would have had no choice but to accept this verdict and await the worst . But modern medical science presented the Haires with a cruel dilemma . They might , said the doctors , have one of Becky 's eyes removed to make sure that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be arrested . The second eye might have to be removed later . The alternative : Becky 's eyes might be treated with X rays and radium . The doctors believed that she would have a 60% chance to recover after surgery , only 35% after radiation . But after removal of an eye or eyes , she would be forever disfigured . <P> Last week , after praying for guidance , the Haires made their choice . It was better , they reasoned , to have some hope that Becky would live , and some day see , without disfigurement , than to be disfigured with no hope-or almost none-of ever seeing . So each day they took her to a private clinic in Memphis for radiation treatments . <P> Said John Haire : " We believe that if God wants her to live , she will . We believe prayer will help more than radium . " All over Memphis , church congregations were offering their prayers for Becky Haire.                   @ @
