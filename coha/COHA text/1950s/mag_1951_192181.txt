On the surface , it seemed last week that the doctors of Victoria Hospital in Kingston-on-Thames had lost their fight to evade the paternal embrace of Britain 's National Health Service . They had wanted to keep their little ( 44-bed ) building as a separate general hospital ( TIME , Dec. 4 ) . But N.H.S . insisted , for efficiency 's sake , on converting it to a gynecological unit , which meant sending " the Vic 's " general patients to the big , impersonal Kingston General Hospital . <P> In his Kingston office last week sat Dr. Frank Lake , 39 , behind a desk piled high with 300 letters , nearly all containing money to help the displaced doctors in their latest scheme : to raise 50,000 for another , still smaller ( 20-bed ) private hospital . There , patients would get the same care as under N.H.S . and on the same terms-that is , without charge . To do this , doctors would have to serve without pay . All 24 have agreed to do so . Now with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 're going to succeed , " he said . " The Victoria Hospital is dead-long live the Victoria Hospital . " <P> The doctors felt that they were fighting to save the intimate , personal relationship between doctor and patient and between family doctor and specialist . " Look here , " said Lake , " if I tell some old dear that she 's got to go into hospital for a pretty sticky operation , and tell her that I 'm going to be there in the operating room with the surgeon , holding her hand , and that I 'll come and see her every day-that can make all the difference to her decision to give consent to the operation , and even to her recovery . Now the old Vic 's closed I have to tell her : ' Here 's a letter . Take it to the Kingston General Hospital and that 's all I can do for you . ' " <P> Many British doctors admired the Kingston rebels for their stand , and King 's Physician Lord Horder volunteered to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be turned back . Said the Lancet : " Though this brave , if misguided , enterprise at Kingston may well succeed . . . though private money may be forthcoming for isolated endeavors of this sort , it will never again be found for a comprehensive hospital service .
