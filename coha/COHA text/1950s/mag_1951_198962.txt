At 67 , Louis Eudeline looked back on 26 years of perfectionist service to his country . As official silver polisher at the Palais de I'Elysee , he had rubbed eight hours a day , through war and peace , at the 7,500 pieces of silver plate which the French Presidents took over from the Bourbons . When the silverware went with the President on state visits to Belgium and Britain , Eudeline journeyed with it ; when World War II broke out and the silver was taken for safety to a country chateau , Eudeline went along to guard it . During the German occupation , Hermann Goring laid even heavier burdens on Polisher Eudeline by ordering 100 more place settings , but the steady rhythm of Eudeline 's buffing arm never faltered . When he retired recently , not one man , but two , took his place . <P> Last week Eudeline went back to the presidential palace to receive his reward . On Eudeline 's chest , President Vincent Auriol pinned the white-enamel-and-silver cross of a chevalier of the Legion of Honor , founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by their knowledge , their virtues , their talent , " have upheld the principles of the French Republic . He will be entitled to wear the inconspicuous red lapel ribbon , and will find special seats reserved for him at parades and other functions-joining the democratic company of the 196,146 Frenchmen who also have the Legion of Honor .
