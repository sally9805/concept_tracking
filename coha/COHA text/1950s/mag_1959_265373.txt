Thousands of copies of a Ceremonial Hymn to NATO were recently distributed to British schoolchildren with the suggestion that they sing it at prayers : <P> <P> May God who rules o'er earth and sky <P> Cleanse our fair world from fear . <P> Let freedom 's banner rise on high <P> And violence disappear . <P> Build up the power of right ; <P> Bid all the free unite . <P> Let NATO grow in might <P> And put its foes to flight . . . <P> The hymn ( air by Thomas Preston , words by Godfrey Lias ) was far from music to the ears of the Manchester Guardian , which huffed editorially : " This has a ring of ' confound their politics , frustrate their knavish tricks ' - the words now rightly dropped from our national anthem . " The Guardian was reminded of Sir John Squire 's lines : <P> God heard the nations shout <P> " Gott strafe England , " " God save the <P> King , " <P> God this , God that , and God the other <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've got my <P> work cut out . " <P> In an indignant Letter to the Editor , Lyricist Lias asked the Guardian : " If we believe in God , surely it can not be wrong to ask for his help-as the Lord 's Prayer does-in delivering the world from fear and violence . " NATO itself , being anxious to keep the peace , made clear that it had blessed no hymns . " If any hymn was ever proposed to the NATO Council , " said one official , " it would have a good deal more trouble getting approved than any note to Khrushchev . "
