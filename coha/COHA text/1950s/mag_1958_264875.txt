In the small and troubled Communist land of North Viet Nam , just about the safest thing to be is a Cabinet Minister . If Boss Ho Chi Minh likes the man , he is apt to keep him around , no matter how many mistakes he makes . But the performance of Finance Minister Le Van Hien was too much even for the indulgent Ho to bear . <P> Le 's chief qualification as a Finance Minister was that he was a faithful party member . A onetime mailman who spent much of his early life in and out of French colonial jails . Le was all right in guerrilla days when he confiscated enough rice from the peasants to feed Ho 's troops , in return for which he issued bales full of newly minted dongs , all bearing Ho 's portrait . But running an economy of 12 million people came a little harder . Today , salaries and taxes are still computed in bags of rice , and on this basis a worker earns 300 bags a year , while his counterpart in non-Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Hanoi , rice is still rationed , and beggars , though forbidden by law , swarm the streets . The dong has sunk so low-7,000 to the dollar-that it may well be the worst currency in the world . Even sister Communist countries refuse to accept it , and North Viet Nam 's trade with them is through barter . Last week at long last , Minister Le , the Red who could write his budgets only in red ink , got the sack .
