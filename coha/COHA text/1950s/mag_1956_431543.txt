 | Our Green Treasury , the National Forests WE stood in a grove of young pines so thick we could see scarcely a hundred feet . In the distance a hound bawled on a hot trail . A woodpecker made a tree rattle like a Cuban drum . Something splashed in the sunlit bayou . " Was that a ' gator ? " I asked Ranger A. P. Mustian , Jr. , of the United States Forest Service . He gave me an apologetic look . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't hear it . I was listening to the music a forester loves best . Notice it ? " Above me the wind was passing by , and suddenly I became aware of the music too . It was the song of the wind in the trees . Hurried Men Squandered an Inheritance I was to hear that wind song in the trees again and again as I traveled 10,000 miles through the national forests of the United States . I heard it thundering in the crowns of baby redwoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine plantations of the Great Lakes country , and I heard it rustling the leaves of young oaks in western North Carolina . It is something of a wonder I ever heard the wind song at all . My ancestors and yours , for more than two centuries , slashed and burned our forests as if they were inexhaustible . History , of course , records their excuse ? they were in a hurry to build a great nation , and the forests helped them build it . But history also adds a sobering footnote ? entire civilizations have disappeared because they failed to conserve their renewable natural resources of trees , grasses , and soils . Wind in Young Trees Sings of New Ways The wind song in new trees , then , is one of the most significant sounds in the United States today . It sings , I think , of a changing from old , wasteful pioneer ways . It means that many of us Americans , despite a bit of backsliding here and there , have accepted the ecological facts of life and are ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe we could have said this 25 years ago . Only now , in mid-20th century , have we decided we had better start taking care of that precious topsoil which makes life possible for us . Many devoted individuals and dedicated organizations helped us reach our happy choice . Among the foremost was the Forest Service . For one thing , this half-century-old branch of the Department of Agriculture pioneered in the conservation business . For another , it works in a vast arena where results can be readily , clearly appraised ; it administers 181 , - 000,000 varied acres divided into 149 national @#  | forests in 38 States , Alaska , and Puerto Rico . Most important , it has had from its very beginning a policy which appeals to the best qualities in the national character . " In the administration of the forest reserves , " wrote Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson in 1905 to Gifford Pinchot , first Forest Service head , it must be clearly borne in mind that all land is to be devoted to its most productive use for the permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of individuals or companies . .. where conflicting interests must be reconciled , the question will always be decided from the standpoint of the greatest good of the greatest number in the long run . " " I do n't know where you could find a more inspiring directive , " Richard E. McArdle , present chief of the Service , told me at his Washington , D. C. , headquarters before I began my journey . " Translating it into action , we evolved two major guiding principles . One is sustained yield ' and the other is multiple use . ' Technical phrases , yes , but they mean a lot . " When we say sustained yield , we mean simply that we manage the forests with ' forever ' in mind . We do n't take out resources without providing for the future . Put it another way : we preserve the capital and use the interest . Watershed Use Gets Priority " As for multiple use , we feel there are five possible major uses for forest land . Here they are : Watersheds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whenever there is a conflict , watershed invariably gets priority . This Nation badly needs more usable water and fewer destructive floods . Forested watersheds do more than anything else to meet those needs . " Otherwise , all uses get the test of the greatest good of the greatest number . ' Sometimes we get all five uses out of one tract of forest land , sometimes only one . " Now , best of luck to you , and I 'll see you when you get back to Washington . " I began the story of my travels with Ranger Mustian 's district on the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana not because it was my first stop ? it was n't but because it is predominantly timber-producing forest , and most people seem to think of a forest primarily in terms of trees to be cut for lumber , or for paper products . " I can grow longleaf pines here as well better than any other place in the world . " Mustian . " Everywhere in Louisiana and rest of the South the wood-using indus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving every day . " So , I grow trees primarily . Yes , I a few deer and some picnic groves and ca permits , but I generally favor timber prod tion over other uses . " As he talked , I contrasted this manage with something I saw on the Pisgah Nati Forest in western North Carolina . Ran Ted Seely and I drove through his district a day of rain and mist . The green F Service jeep growled angrily at the s grades and writhing turns . Deer Keep Forest Neat as a Park Our noisy passing sent deer bounding acr the road . It seemed to me I could see t white tails waving for an uncommonly I distance ; in my experience most deer had always melted quickly into the woods . I said something about it to Ted . " You bet you can see them , " he replied " We 've got so many they keep all the underbrush eaten out . I ca n't even plant a pine seedling around here unless I spray on a gunk ' that keeps hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now : a good part of my district is a game management area . run in cooperation with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission . Here , wildlife gets high priority . " Timber in Louisiana , deer in North Carolina ? and then , in Tucson , Arizona , one Sunday was warm and pleasant . " Come on , Dad , " said my daughters Barbara and Joan . " Let 's go picnic in Sabino Canyon . " Handy to town , Sabino proved to be a @#  | miles north into the Sierra , building an aqueduct system that cost a good $90,000,000 . This Los Angeles-Owens Valley Aqueduct bores through mountains , descends hills , and even flows through the blazing Mojave Desert to bring the city more than half of its domestic , industrial , and irrigation water ? and nearly every drop comes off the Inyo National Forest on the east Sierra slopes . A portion of the Los Angeles supply comes by another aqueduct from the Colorado River . Here again national forests play a vital role ; 23 of them in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest protect a watershed ? I learned the basic facts at the Forest Service 's Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory nestled in the Appalachians in western North Carolina near the Georgia boundary ( page 300 ) . Dropped leaves , needles , dead limbs and plants , even the fallen bodies of trees help form topsoil . This precious material the trees bind with their roots , so that neither wind nor water can dislodge it . Water can soak down through topsoil instead of running off on the surface . Some goes deep underground to form the reservoir ? the water table ? we tap when we dig a well ; some bubbles away to streams and rivers . Water under such natural control does not tear the soil from its lodgings or fill rivers with silt . But Edward A. Johnson , Coweeta 's youthful director , took me into his hills to see what happens when somebody tampers with a watershed 's guardian forest . " We 've done some terrible things to these lovely hills in the name of science , " said Ed . He stopped the jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of a typical steep mountain farm . We had a local farmer come in to clear the trees and put in his crops . One summer storm washed 76 tons of topsoil down into the catchment basin on the stream . We weighed every pound of it , @#  | and there it is , overflowing that big bin . " After seven years the corn crop was n't worth the trouble of planting ; previous crops had taken just about all the nutrients in the meager woods soil . Our farmer friend picked up and moved . We proved here you should n't farm unsuitably steep slopes . " I saw other Coweeta watersheds that had been overgrazed , carelessly logged , or otherwise deliberately maltreated . In varying degree , the result was the same : too little stream flow in dry weather ; floods , erosion , and silting in wet ; erratic or unproductive wells . From Coweeta and similar outdoor laboratories elsewhere in the country , we 've learned there are basic principles for the management of all watersheds , whatever the varying local problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watersheds in cover . Whatever is best suited to individual soil , climate , and degree of slope is the best cover as a rule . For most steep watersheds in this country the prime cover is forest . " Good forestry can improve upon nature . A classic example is furnished by an experiment on part of a watershed serving Denver , Colorado . Originally it was heavily forested with lodgepole pine . But too much snow caught in the dense trees , evaporated , and never reached the ground to melt . The Forest Service thinned the lodgepole , and now the watershed produces more water . Eroded Hills Invite Flash Floods Only when rain or snowfall is abnormal does a healthy watershed produce floods ; far more often , it prevents them . The Angeles National Forest , which covers the San Gabriel Mountains and their foothills , undoubtedly keeps whole sections of the sprawling city of Los Angeles from inundation by mud and water during the rainy season in winter . Stands of pine and fir keep the very erosible soil in place on 96,000 high acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothills . When something takes off the cover ? and " something " is usually fire ? only expensive flood-control works can stop the destructive rush of water . A fire burned about 5,000 acres in one canyon on the Angeles in 1933 . A flood followed , taking 30-odd lives and either destroying or badly damaging 400 homes in La Crescenta and Montrose . Heavy rains hit @# other sections of the Angeles too , but the floods came only from that one burned canyon . The watershed value of the national forests is inestimable . You can not mark down a dollars-and-cents figure for it . But timber and grazing uses do carry a price tag . Forest Service headquarters estimates they will bring more than $100,000,000 into the United States Treasury during 1956 . Like watershed , recreational use of the national forests has no hard-and-fast value ; yet there is reason to believe it is now , or is well on the road to becoming , the second greatest asset of the public woodlands . Another Forest Product : Serenity As near as the Service can estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests this year by folk who picnicked , skied , camped , hunted , fished , or just got away from it all . James K. Vessey , one of the wisest heads I encountered in the Forest Service , believes all these visitors took far more than happy memories home with them . " This is the age of crowding into great cities , an era of tension-breeding hurry , " said Jim , an assistant regional forester at Milwaukee , Wisconsin . " Now , I 'm a forester by profession , not a health expert , but I read in the newspapers how mental illness and juvenile delinquency are getting to be serious problems . I have a hunch some relief , maybe even an honest-togoodness cure , might be to get a little solitude once in a while , in the kind of surroundings the good Lord originally meant man to live in . " When I traveled , it was out of the main visiting season for the forests , but I did see a little of the varied fun that people get from these havens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , when I soared in a Forest Service plane above Mount Hood National Forest in Oregon , looking down on some of the last extensive virgin timber stands in the United States . Giant fir clothed the mountains. * Surprisingly , the country looked fairly open , although Monte Pierce , my pilot , said part of it was so steep that no logger had ever tried to operate in it . Virgin forest is more parklike than most people imagine . The ancient trees have crowded out younger competitors and underbrush .  | We circled the beautiful mountain for which the forest is named . Beneath us incongruously appeared a parking lot with gleaming cars , and chimneys thrusting out of deep snow . " What in the world ... ? " I began . " Timberline Lodge , " said Monte . " One of the finest ski resorts in the country . The snow is up to the roof line " ( opposite ) . Tiny black dots zipped down long white slopes like water bugs on a pond . We angled sharply for a closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused a spill . A girl with streaming blond hair , gliding down the run , looked up and spotted us aiming in her general direction . She sat down abruptly in a shower of snow . Should she read this , : Monte and I offer our apologies . In striking contrast to the ski resorts that dot the northern forests from New England to the Pacific is Alexander Springs on the Ocala National Forest in Florida . Here people swim the year round in a crystal-clear pool where the water temperature hovers around 76 ? . Fishermen catch epic largemouth black bass in Alexander Springs Creek . Tracks of the puma ( locally called panther ) show at sunup on the sands where fishermen have cleaned their catches . Fred Schultz , who operates the bathhouses and store , is full of " panther " stories . " All of them phonies , " baited Larry Newcomb , supervisor of Florida national forests . " Why , durn it , " retorted Fred , " only a month or so back I stood 15 feet from a mother panter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over , and ole maw just yawned ; she knew who 'd been ' leaving fish out for her ! " When we were out of Fred 's hearing , Larry admitted to me that there were , indeed , panthers on the Ocala , as well as bears , deer , ducks , bobcats , and other varieties of furred and feathered game . " But , " he added , " I still say that if a mother lion had opened her mouth at Fred , he 'd have run so far we 'd never have seen him again . " Fishermen ? and fisherwomen and fisherchildren ? are enthusiastic users of the forests . The stream I remember best was a tumultuous torrent of murky snow melt on the Chequamegon National Forest in Wisconsin . I guard its name ; the day I saw it , there were a number of husky local citizens about , spying out the prospects for the imminent first day o the fishing season , and I enjoy life tn. , much to risk giving away the location of their favorite fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way upstream to spawn . ' hump ! A streamlined iridescent torpedo shot from a deep pool into the rapids . The shallow , swift water barely reached to his dorsal fin , givin very little purchase to his powerful props : : - sive machinery . Nevertheless he made it t a higher pool , there to regain his strength f the next rapids . There is so much fishing in the nation ; forests that some of the streams and lakemust be stocked . J. Baylor Roberts , who made the photographs that illustrate this article , told me about an ultramodern meth , d of stocking a lake . " I was flying with a Forest Service pilot over the wilderness area of Superior National Forest , looking for a camper to photograph . he said ( page 294 . ) . " The pilot remarked he wished he had his fish tanks in , he 'd stock a back-country lake . " I wanted to know how we could make pictures and stock a lake all at the same time . He said we would n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dive low , pull a lever , and literally bomb the lake with fingerling trout. * " I asked him if the drop hurt the fish . No , ' he said , unless I miss and drop them in the trees . ' Quite a joker , that boy : he told me they put a couple of flying fish in each tank as instructors for the trout ! " Logging on the Lush Oregon Coast You see Forest Service cooperation with private enterprise at its very best when you see a logging operation . The Service never does apy commercial cutting , but sells the public timber on the stump to lumbermen wh , fell it and haul it away to the mill . I saw a timber sale on the Cascade Head Experimental Forest , a part of the Siuslaw National Forest on the Oregon coast . Behind it lay months of planning . Carl Berntsen , who runs the experiments on the Cascade Head , had decided a tract should come down ; it was overmature . Old trees had virtually stopped growing . While they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @#  | The tract was Douglas fir . Had it been regular national forest , not , an experimental area , it would have been put to bid . The winning operator would have signed a contract with the Forest Service , agreeing to build the logging roads to Service standards . Sometimes the Government builds the roads . Either way , they remain Government property , for the future use of hunters , fishermen , fire crews , or other loggers . Carl 's operator went into the woods under the terms of a negotiated agreement . He assented to the usual Forest Service stipulations as to good forestry ? for example , not to disfigure the hills , lest erosion begin ; to halt operations on days of high fire danger ; to dispose of waste limbs , tops , and chunks . Now the loggers came in , each crew with a gasoline-driven chain saw . Not for the modern lumberjack is the slow labor of handsawing . The power saw can cut down any but the very largest tree in ten minutes or so ( page 316 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , spar trees were left standing . Daring high climbers went u13 these giants to strip them of branches and attach to their tops the long tackles that would be carried out into the woods to bring the timber in to the base of the spar tree . In lumbermen 's parlance , this was a highlead " operation : the tackle angled down from high up , so that it would lift the logs as it pulled . thus keeping them from fouling on rocks and stumps .  | Horses or oxen brought in the logs in the old days . The modern high-lead rig has a gasoline or diesel engine . It can bring in several logs at a time , with amazing speed . Caterpillar-tracked monsters called " jammers " stood at loading points to lift the logs onto huge trailer trucks . The drivers of these trucks must be among the world 's most skillful ; I saw them nonchalantly taking their 75-ton loads down logging roads on which I would hesitate to drive a jeep ( page 319 ) . These loggers on the Cascade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , five or six feet in diameter , 200 feet high . This was saw timber . From it mills would cut boards and structural lumber , after setting aside the best clear bolts to be peeled into thin layers of veneer for plywood . Pines Replace Cotton in Worn-out Fields In the United States more wood is still cut for lumber than for anything else , but cutting for pulp is increasing . A pulp mill , obviously , can use smaller trees than a sawmill can , for the pulp mill grinds up everything . Blessed with normally abundant rainfall and a long growing season , the South has for some years been steadily increasing its pulpwood production , stocking thousands of acres of cutover woods and worked-out cotton fields with valuable pines ( page 298 ) . Every year the West uses more logging waste , formerly burned or left to rot , for pulpwood ; the North has long had a big pulp industry . Out in the Superior National Forest of Minnesota , near Ely , lies Forest Center , a logging camp operated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Forest Service to cut some saw timber and lots of pulpwood on many thousands of acres . The operation represents the best kind of modern forestry . The company makes money on the wood it cuts , many hundreds of people get employment , local and Federal treasuries are swelled , and the Forest Service gets thousands of acres newly cleared for the planting of high-grade pine seedlings . I drove along one of Forest Center 's logging roads with Ranger Gus Block . Hidden power saws snarled in the woods on either hand . If the felling was modern , the haul to roadside was not ; horses skidded in the logs , as in the old times . The lumberjacks lived in trailers and shacks that moved ever deeper into the forest as the operation progressed . One or two had their wives with them , but most had automobiles parked handy and went home to neighboring towns on week ends . One husky jack complained there was still too much snow in the woods to make logging either pleasant or profitable : the men are paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man mentioned seeing moose and timber wolf tracks in his section of woods . What would you do if you walked up on either one ? " I wanted to know . " Just start up the chain saw , " he grinned . " Nothing can stand that noise , not even my wife . " Despite the power saws and automobiles something of the old logging camp flavor still clings to a place like Forest Center . Plenty of old-timers still work in the woods , men who can swing a double-bitted ax as though it were a ping-pong paddle . Saturday nights are lots quieter , however . Tomahawk frowns on carousing , and Selma Niemi sees to it that loudmouths do n't eat . Swedish-born widow of a Finnish woodsman , Selma cooks for the Forest Center mill hands , office hands , lumberjacks strayed in from the woods , and visiting writers . Three meals a day she turns out for this crowd . and she does all the washing up too . Silence Reigns at Chow Time I found out how she manages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her over my third plate of delicious stew . " Mister writer , oust look on the wall . " she said . " The sign says no talking at the table . and it means it , yessirree . Talking slows down eating , and I got to clean up quick for the next shift . " Now look . I like you fine , but you finish up in seven minutes like the rest . Quit talking and eat , by yiminy ! " I ate . " Smart boy , " whispered Ranger Block . " Selma could pitch you , me , and three timber beasts ' out the door at one time . She handled an ax in the woods with the best of them before she retired to this easy job . " But when I left , Selma filled my pockets with huge fresh cookies . " You can take your time and enyoy these , " she whispered . Out in the north woods around Forest Center , Indians trap beaver and gather wild rice . Compared to some national forest uses I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pisgah National Forest in western North Carolina issue permits for digging ginseng roots . This is valuable stuff ; most of it finds its way to the Far East , where it is much in demand among the Chinese as a medicine . " ' Seng " diggers are the mystery folk of the mountains . They work singly and furtively , always watching their back trails lest competitors follow them to their favorite ginseng coves . They drop ' seng seed in secret places . All of them , however , duly check in with their loads at Forest Service ranger stations and pay the Government about $2 a pound for what they have dug . Worm Grunters Harvest Bait Another Pisgah familiar is the worm grunter . He jams a stick in the ground and rubs it with another , which produces a grunting sound . Vibration makes the fishing worms come up , and the worm grunter catches them for sale to cityfolk . These fellows do n't have to pay a fee . In the West , rangers issue permits to gather sword fern . This sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from southern national forests . California rangers told me they sold gnarled manzanita bushes and a kind of wild buckwheat ; with these , the florists make the familiar living-room decoration known as a " ming tree . " Then there is the apiarist . On a nationwide scale he is big business . In his pickup truck and small trailer loaded with hives of honeybees , he follows the flowers wherever they bloom . I saw some of these apiarists in the Ocala and Osceola National Forests in Florida , where they had stopped to let their bees make honey from the blooms of tupelo gum and titi bushes . Here they sometimes argue with bears . Most beekeepers protect the portable hives with electrified fences . This keeps nearly all the bears out , but sometimes a tough honeystruck bruin will grit his teeth , ignore the shock , climb the fence , and set to in the hives . For reasons I do not know , many southern countryfolk have no fear of a bear . When a bear gets in the hives , a beekeeper will charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually a pine knot . Many a country church stands free on a national forest . Scouts , civic and religious groups , and conservation organizations can rent summer-outing camps from the Forest Service for a nominal fee . In areas unsuited to general public use , the Service will rent you a plot for a reasonable fee , and on it you can build a summer home . The Service keeps a veto right , in case you want to build something out of character with the forest . Ranger Chet Olson on the Coconino National Forest in Arizona rents locations t , . moviemakers . For a big picture needing lots of room , the Government may get as much as $50 a day per set ? a mighty modest price for the glories of Oak Creek Canyon and the fabulously beautiful red-rock country at its lower end . Chet showed me a complete town built by the moviemen and already used in several westerns . " They put up different signs , new building fronts , and new paint jobs for every picture . " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people to know they were seeing the same old place every time . " You ought to see them age a brand new building . They spray some kind of stuff on the raw yellow lumber , and in an hour it looks like it 's been weathering 100 years . " Pests Kill More Trees than Fire The job of protecting all the varied wealth that lies sprawled in the national forests is a formidable one . Fire , bugs , disease , storm . misuse , harmful animals ? the woods have a host of enemies . Heretical as it may sound , the old axiom that fire is the main enemy is beginning to be questioned . Fire is still a tough customer , but insects and disease , the most recent figures disclose , kill ten times as many trees . For one thing , fire fighting is becoming more efficient each year . Exploration and inventory of our national forests and their contents , on the other hand , is only just being  | completed , and the Service now has more complete information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably have been taking ever since there were forests in the Nation . Yearly the tree scientists step up their battle against the silent killers . They spray great forest areas by air to kill the oddly named spruce budworm , which actually does most damage to balsam fir and the valuable Douglas fir ( page 320 ) . To control Engelmann spruce bark beetles , they squirt insecticides on individual trees ( page 313 ) . To keep white pine blister rust from spreading , they destroy currant and gooseberry bushes ; the disease does not pass from tree to tree , but must spend part of its life cycle in these bushes . In one of the Forest Service entomological laboratories I met a wasplike creature that is a friend of trees . He is so tiny I could not see him clearly except through a microscope . He nevertheless is a parasitic foe of forestdestroying bugs . The Service wants to encourage this little fellow and others like him , for a natural enemy is one of the best checks on a pest . Flames Can Leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping a mile-wide lake in a few seconds , has always been the sort of clear-cut opponent that Americans understand. * Unfortunately , we are still prone to underrate that adversary until he strikes . For the past several years we have been averaging about 17.5,000 forest fires annually , and we started 90 percent of them ourselves , sometimes deliberately , but more often through sheer carelessness . Despite Smokey Bear , the campaign in the field of public education is not yet won ( page 307 ) . We 're lucky , then , that fire fighting today is a lot more efficient than it used to be . In addition to modern techniques , fire fighters have superb equipment ? airplanes , helicopters , all-terrain ground transport , and radio communications . Road and trail networks , over which they can speed instantly to a smoke , reach farther into the forests every year . For the areas where there are no roads , there are the famed smokejumpers ( pages 310 and 311 ) . The Forest Service 's Equipment Development Center at Arcadia , California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trenching machines , and other devices that go into the field with the fire crews . " Actually , however , " as one expert told me , " I do n't believe that equipment improvement and development alone will show us how to keep from having the relatively few big fires that cause the most damage . I think our researchers must let their imaginations soar into the wild blue yonder for answers that today would seem fantastic . " Experts Study " Blowup " Fires Such a one is George 1I . Byram of the Service 's Southeastern Forest Experiment Station at Asheville , North Carolina . He is one of the men who are trying to find out what makes an ordinary , garden-variety forest fire ? the kind that any competent fire crew can quickly cool ? suddenly explode into a major conflagration . Foresters call this a " blowup " fire . The McGee fire that last year nearly overran the General Grant Grove within the boundaries of the Kings Canyon National Park of California was a blowup ( pages 288 and 308 ) . So were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghastly barrens . These infernos trap fire fighters , wipe out woods communities , and create fiery tornadoes that sometimes send swirling columns of gases and hot air 25,000 feet into the heavens . " We ca n't give you the final answers on blowups , " said Ralph M. Nelson of the division of fire research at Asheville . " We have made some interesting discoveries , however . One is that , in addition to the usual factors like fuel and ground-wind velocity , a turbulent atmosphere and jet streams of some kind tend to make an ordinary fire explode into a blowup . " I do n't mean the jet streams that race around the earth 20,000 to 40,000 feet high . I mean smaller ones that come far closer to the earth . We call them jet currents . ' " Any wind currents , of course , vary in speed . No rule to it ? it 's just a natural thing , the way one fellow will drive his car a little faster than another . " Now when you have a wind that increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know what to expect . But when the wind speed decreases with height ? in other words , when the upper winds are lagging behind the lower , thus creating a jet current .  | we find a fire under them mysteriously developing chimneylike convection currents and erratic behavior ? and then the boys on the fire lines better watch out ! " Another group of Forest Service researchers and cooperators is reaching into the " blue yonder " out West . These are the workers in Project Skyfire . They hope to stop lightningset blazes , which are the bane of the rugged and inaccessible national forests in the West and Southwest . Seeding Clouds to Halt Lightning They have been trying to find a pattern in fire-causing lightning storms , using specially trained lookouts on the regular Service fire towers to identify clouds , track lightning storms , and learn all they can about their behavior ( page 322 ) . After they have enough data , they will see if they can break up dry lightning clouds before they loose their bolts of fire . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds by plane this summer in Arizona and in the northern Rockies . Stopping fires is a readily understandable form of conservation . But learning how to use wood more efficiently is conservation too . At Longview , Washington , after touring the 670-acre plant of the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company , I realized I had not seen a sawmill refuse burner , with which so many mills are still equipped . We burn our ' dirty wood ' ? sawdust , bark , and wood that ca n't be made into salable products ? to generate steam and electricity , " said Irvin Luiten , who was showing me around . " But we 're fast reaching the point here and at some of our other mills where we have to supplement this fuel supply with oil . Wood is cellulose , too valuable to burn ; we 're turn- , ing more and more into useful products . " One section of the plant was taking short , narrow boards and making them into long , wide ones by gluing them edge-to-edge and end-to-end . It struck me that right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcity of big saw timber . In the extensive Weyerhaeuser timber holdings there is still much virgin Douglas fir forest , and in this forest are overmature trees attacked by a fungus that pocks the wood with white spots . The company turns the pocked wood into " driftwood " paneling for homes and offices . I saw some of it in a display building . To me it suggested the pecky cypress and worms chestnut popular in the East . " After we 've used everything we can making lumber , " Irvin continued , " we 'll still have slabs , edgings , and trimmings that ( In not fall into the dirty-wood category . This we 'll chip up for pulp manufacture . " Out of research came these and myriad other uses for wood. * Big companies like Weyerhaeuser have their own private research staffs . Large and small alike . however , lean heavily on the Forest Service 's Forest Products Laboratory at Madison , Wisconsin . Established in 1910. it has so many achievements that I can list only a few here . It pioneered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic processes that permit pulp mills to use short-fibered hardwoods and resinous pines . It patented the internal fan-type kiln now in almost universal use . Its research provided the basis for all United States lumber grades . It pioneered in this country the gluing of many strips of wood into massive beams and arches ? the process known now as lamination ( page 317 ) . Many modern churches use laminated wood arches . I saw the firm of John Trumpy &; Sons , Inc. , yacht builders of Annapolis , Maryland , putting laminated keels , stems , and frames into new Navy minesweepers , which must be wooden lest they set off the modern magnetic mines they are designed to sweep . Discoveries still pour out of the Forest Products Laboratory in a steady stream . The lab only recently announced it had a fiberboard it believes will be able to screen out atomic radiation while allowing life-sustaining oxygen to pass through . @#  | With waterproof paper overlays , technicians now can give low-grade lumber a smooth surface . " Think of the bleachers at a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director . " Personally , when I do , I think about splint tern . Our new board offers bleacherites of the future a new freedom of action . " Inevitably , the Forest Products Laboratory developed close ties with forest geneticists , since it is possible to grow wood for individual uses . If a livestock breeder can develop one hog for lean hams and another for lard , why should not a tree breeder be able to perform the equivalent forestry miracle ? Tree hybridization holds limitless promise At Placerville , California , in experimental nurseries of the Forest Service 's Institute . ? f Forest Genetics , I saw a row of trees that professional foresters with me could not identify F. I. ( Pete ) Righter , in charge of the institute . finally told them it was a three-way hybrid of ponderosa , Jeffrey , and Coulter pines , produced by hand-pollination ( page 291 ) . " It grows fast like Coulter , " said Pete , " and shows promise of having the better wood quality of the other two parents . Some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , turning out quality timber at a rate unknown in nature . "  | A cross between eastern white pine and Himalayan white pine may be the answer to white pine blister rust . The foreign tree resists the disease and appears to have passed on this characteristic to the hybrid . " Breeding trees takes a little time , " Pete Righter told me , " but we get results quicker than is generally realized . Fortunately we do n't have to have the high degree of uniformity in trees that is necessary in agricultural products . Also , we find that poor hybrids die off speedily in ordinary forest competition , so we get negative answers , at least , in a very short time . " Faster than hybridization is simple selection of the best trees for perpetuation . You merely gather seed from selected ones and plant it . High-quality seedlings usually result . For even quicker results the forester takes @# cuttings from the best trees and either grafts them onto established root systems or forces them to make roots of their own . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been developed into a fine art . Branches are made to grow root systems while still on the parent tree . Then they are cut and planted to grow in seed orchards . Forestry started late in this country ; yet it has come a long way since the days of Gifford Pinchot , who had to learn his profession in Europe because there were no forestry schools in the United States . Out in the woods , according to the Forest Service 's Timber Resource Review , the bright spots are the national and other public forests and the holdings of large forest industry operators . But 60 percent of the Nation 's commercial forests are owned in small parcels by some 4,500,000 farmers , bankers , doctors . lawyers , and others whose prime interest is not forestry . For the most part , the Review says , their woods are not healthy ; they are not being left in productive condition to grow new timber crops . Cooperating to " Keep America Green " These small owners need to be shown the need for good forestry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and State forestry agencies have been cooperating in programs to help them . Results of the teamwork show plainly in organized fire protection and low-cost seedling trees . Cooperative project foresters give on-theground technical aid to thousands of woodland owners every year . Federal and State extension services give farm forestry information and lend a hand to 4-H youths learning how to take care of trees . Private groups by the hundreds swell the tide , organizations like the Boy Scouts and the Izaak Walton League of America . The Southern Pulpwood Conservation Association ceaselessly pleads for good forestry in the piney woods ; Trees for Tomorrow , Inc. , for scientific management in the Wisconsin timberlands . With its nationwide " Keep America Green " campaign , American Forest Products Industries provides valuable help in fire prevention to the Forest Service 's and State foresters ' Smokey Bear . When I returned to Washington , I saw chief forester McArdle again . " I hope , " he said , " you 've seen some poor forest as well as good . " He must have noticed my bewilderment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't 324 have a long way to go , " he explained to me . " It 's true the national forests are steadily improving , and that a lot of private forest owners are doing an excellent job of managing their timberlands . " But our population is growing steadily , and this Nation will be making ever-increasing demands on its forests ? for wood to supply expanding industries and greater consumer demand , for usable supplies of water , for recreation , and the help toward physical and spiritual health that people can get from the forests . " If we are to meet these growing demands , we 'll have to make our forests more productive than they are now , and then keep them that way . We must make them yield their full potential , nothing less . That is the goal . " From what I saw of the Forest Service , the work is in good hands . If the Service continues to get the support it needs when the going is rough , then never again should there be a generation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees .
