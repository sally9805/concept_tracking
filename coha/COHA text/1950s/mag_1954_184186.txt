Swimming Crawfish . For 60 crawfish prepare a bouillon with 2 cups dry white wine , cup cognac , 3 large carrots and one large onion cut in thin slices , 1 teaspoon salt , a pinch of cayenne and 3 chopped shallots . Boil covered for hour . Then put in crawfish and boil for 10 minutes , turning them about three or four times . Serve hot , cold or tepid . <P> Gigot de la Clinique . A surgeon living in the provinces , as fond of good cheer as he was learned , invented this recipe , which we acquired by bribing his cook . No leg of venison can compare with a simple leg of mutton prepared in the following manner . Eight days in advance you will cover the leg of mutton with the marinade called Baume Samaritain , composed of wine-old Burgundy , Beaune or Chambertin-and virgin olive oil . Into this balm , to which you have already added the usual condiments of salt , pepper , bay leaf , thyme , beside an atom of ginger root , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , a handful of crushed jumper berries , and lastly a dessertspoon of powdered sugar ( effective as musk in perfumery ) , which serves to fix the different aromas . Twice a day you will turn the gigot . Now we come to the main point of the preparation . After you have placed the gigot in the marinade , you will arm yourself with a surgical syringe of a size to hold pint , which you will fill with cup of cognac and cup of fresh orange juice . Inject the contents of the syringe into the fleshy part of the gigot in three different spots . Refill the syringe with the same contents and inject into the gigot twice more . Each day you will fill the syringe with the marinade and inject the contents into the gigot . At the end of the week the leg of mutton is ready to be roasted ; perfumed with the condiments and the spices , completely permeated by the various flavors , it has been transfused into a strange and exquisite venison . Roast and serve with the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving 2 tablespoons of the blood of a hare . <P> Virgin Sauce . For 1 person , place 5 tablespoons butter in a hot bowl , add teaspoon salt , beat with a whisk until the butter foams , put it over hot but not boiling water for an instant . The butter must not melt . When the butter foams , add drop by drop , never ceasing to whisk , 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon tepid water . When they are well amalgamated with the foaming butter , add 1 tablespoon whipped cream and serve at once . This sauce is delicious with cold fish . It is something apart . <P> Salzburger Knocker .
