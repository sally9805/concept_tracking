In their biggest bid to capture Paris ' high-fashion trade , most of Italy 's top designers showed off their spring &; summer creations last week in Florence 's Grand Hotel . As usual , the Italians were at their best in sportswear and play clothes , and none was better than Milan 's blonde , fortyish Jole Veneziani , a onetime furrier who went into dress-designing only six years ago . <P> Where most designers show only a handful of originals , industrious Mme. Veneziani startled everybody by reeling off so many - ( 130 , mainly sportswear ) that she had her mannequins parade four and five at once to save time . When she was done , even her rivals cast aside professional jealousy to swarm around her , crying , " Bravissimo ! n and bussing her plump cheek . Overcome , Veneziani broke down and wept . Said a California department-store buyer : " The entire American sports world should have been here ! " <P> Half Price . Not only in Florence , but in Rome , Milan and other major cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Less than two years ago , Italy 's designers were scarcely known outside their own country . But U.S. buyers , fed up with Paris ' high prices and highhandedness , have been spending more &; more money in Italy . The clothes are excellent and sell for only about half as much as Paris ' . Last week 's ranges : $200 to $250 for suits , $250 to $450 for cocktail dresses and short formal gowns , $300 to $450 for most ball gowns . <P> The renaissance is due chiefly to the shrewd promotion of Florence 's exporter , B. Giorgini , who realized that Italy 's designers were too scattered for buyers to see all their work . Last February he footed the bill himself ( in return for a 5% commission on all sales ) for the first collective showing in Florence by most of the top designers . That show and another last summer were such successes that there were shows all over Italy last week , and U.S. buyers were hard put to catch them all . <P> Cause for Worry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-white evening dress , which Rome 's Alberto Fabiani had lavishly embroidered with beads , buttons and tiny seashells . Fabiani also showed a shirtlike beach smock , in white and red cotton squares with a white pique collar , so long that it hides the bathing suit and so puffy that it resembles a maternity blouse . Other eye-catchers : the butterfly-winged cape which Princess Gabriella di Giardinelli ( " Gabriellasport " ) designed for her yellow silk evening gown ; a short evening dress of black lace on white organdie by the Fontana sisters ; a white wool pullover , with close-fitting slacks , by Milan 's Mirsa . Not only U.S. buyers , but Europeans , flocked to the salons . Plainly , the Italians were giving the French plenty of cause for worry .
