txt Bernard Goldfine returns to the witness chair tomorrow morning under threat of contemptof-Congress proceedings unless he reverses himself and answers questions about his financial affairs . The New England industrialist returned to Washington today after a week-end in Boston . He declined to say , however , whether he would continue to refuse to answer questions his attorneys consider irrelevant to the investigation . Mr. Goldfine left Washington Saturday denouncing the Special House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight for " smear , pry and spy " tactics . Today , one of his attorneys assailed the subcommittee and its chairman , Representative Oren Harris , Democrat of Arkansas . The attack was made by Samuel P. Sears . Mr. Sears charged that his client had been subjected to " smears " and " vilification " in an " incredible performance " by the subcommittee . Mr. Sears addressed himself to . Mr. Harris ' appearance - yes-  terday on the television panel show " Meet The Press . " The chairman 's remarks on the show , he said , were " a pathetic attempt to , justify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some instances , " completely false . " He specifically criticized Mr. Harris ' suggestion that publicity activities by the Goldfine group had been designed to distract the public from facts developed in the hearing room . Mr. Sears charged that the subcqmmittee had permitted " smears " and had failed to comply with Congressional rules of procedure in the hope that it could " overshadow the plain fact that the committee has accomplished just nothing . " Sears Takes Exception With the witness " completely at the mercy of the committee , " he went on , " vilification " could be met only through resort to the press : This was the only reason Mr. Goldfine had a press representative , Mr. Sears said . He also took exception to Mr. Harris ' statement that Mr. Goldfine 's ' attorneys had been shown the prepared statement to be read by John Fox before it had been read in open session . Mr. Fox is a former Boston publisher . The subcommittee has been criticized for permitting him to give undocumented hearsay evidence against Mr. Goldfine in public hearings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' prepared statement had not been shown to Mr. Goldfine 's attorneys before it was delivered . Mr. Harris , he said , did tell the Goldfine attorneys that " there was such a statement but that it contained nothing defamatory . " It was only after it was read , Mr. Sears went on , that he found it had been " riddled with slander and defamation and absolute falsehoods . " " Either the chairman is deliberately misstating the facts , or he has had a lapse of memory , " Mr. Sears stated . Mr. Harris refused again today to identify the four additional witnesses he said had been subpoenaed to appear before the subcommittee in connection with the Goldfine case . The investigation began as a study of Mr. Goldfine 's relations with Sherman Adams , the Assistant to the President . The question before it is whether Mr. Adams , who received the loan of an Oriental rug , a vicufia coat and about $3,000 in hotel accommodations from Mr. Goldfine , used White House influence to get his Boston friend special treatment from the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branched into an examination of some $770,000 in treasurer 's checks and certified checks that Mr. Goldfine had drawn since 1941 . It has also inquired about large-scale money withdrawals from the East Boston Company , in which he held a large interest . Last week the subcommittee demanded to know the purpose of these transactions . Mr. Goldfine and his lawyers contend that this is irrelevant to the panel 's investigations of the regulatory agencies and have so far refused to answer on this ground . Today Mr. Goldfine told newsmen that he would " tell what my lawyers advise me " about the controversial financial transactions . Mr. Sears said today that there was no substance to week-end , reports that Mr. Goldfine planned to ask the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee  --  parent body of the investigating subcommittee  --  for a ruling that the investigators had exceeded their authority . This report , Mr. Sears said , was fabricated of " thin air . " Mr. Goldfine would neither confirm nor deny reports from Boston that he had not filed a Federal income tax return for 1956. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
