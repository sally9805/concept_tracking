txt The Department of Health , Education and Welfare chides us in a letter on this page today for having our facts wrong in a recent editorial about the Administration 's $1 billion science education program . Assistant Secretary Richardson sent us a " Fact Sheet " from the U.S. Office of Education to help us arrive at an " accurate understanding " of the Administration 's program . The statement to which he took chief ' exception was this : " Almost everyone knows that the Administration wants Congress to spend $1 billion to provide 1,000 college scholarships to strengthen scientific education . " On reading it over , we can see his objections ourselves very well . First , Mr. Richardson points out that the scholarships would total 10,000 a year , not 1,000 . We were aware of that Sand wrote it that way . But by some unhappy chance it came out in the Washington-printed papers wrong ; ' elsewhere the figure appeared correctly , as 10,000 . Mr. Richardson is also correct when he points out that the scholarships program is not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , to be sure , a key factor in the entire $1 billion program , and we think an argument could be made that with ; out the scholarships to help produce scientists Congress might very well wonder what the $1 billion program was all about . Be that as it may , we erred in implying that the total would go for scholarships . But almost anyone can err , and we suppose that is what happened to the H.E.W . Department in its estimation both as to the cost of the scholarships and the length of time the program would last . The scholarships will not , as Mr. Richardson writes , " cost $7,500,000 the first year , or $22,500,000 over four years . " The figures are far below the mark . They are below the mark , that is , if the figures in the Office of Education 's " Fact Sheet " are right . For there we learn that " the Administration propose 's that an appropriation of $7,500,000 be authorized for the first year of the program , $15,000,000 for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fourth year . After that the sums needed would decline in proportion to the number of scholarship holders still in college . " Now those figures add up to $75 million . And an additional $45 million would have to be added to get out of college the young people who enter college the fourth year of the program . So the total comes to $120 million , considerably higher than the statement that the cost will run only $22.5 million . As to our calling the $1 billion program a scientific program , the fact remains that that is the way it , was presented . A detailed breakdown Mr. Richardson himself gave the newspapers on January 27 when the President delivered his Education Message to Congress discloses that of the first year 's requested appropriation of $223,759,000 , all but about $35 million is specifically earinar : : ed for science and mathematics . We bring these facts out because we think , like Mr. Richardson , that comment and debate on the Administration 's proposal can be of value . We hope the public will arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program . And among them are : That if it is not a scientific education program , it has been-flying false colors . And that the program  --  unless some of the students are to graduate the same year they enter  --  would have to go on for seven years before it ended . If , once begun , it ever ended at all .
