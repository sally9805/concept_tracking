A Name for the City A Story by William Faulkner " F .. XPERIENCE , " Uncle Gavin said , " is not J in the senses , but in the heart .

There was no church , no school , least of all , a courthouse . Because although they probably knew from the first that they wanted , needed , would some day have a church and a school , it would be almost a quarter of a century before they would discover suddenly that they not only had to have a courthouse , but they had to have it quick .

Which  --  that they were the Harpes  --  was impossible , since the Harpes and even the last of Mason 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robbers would have had to belong to Murrell's. organization  --  if they needed to belong to any at all other than the simple fraternity of rapine ) captured by chance by a band of militia and brought in to the settlement jail because it was the nearest . Or a chance hand of militia rather , since the presence of the band was a third fortuity , it having been part of a general muster at the settlement two days ago for a Fourth of July barbecue , which by the next clay had hoiled down into one drunken brawling which rendered even the last hardy survivors vulnerable enough for the residents of the settlement to eject them , this particular band having been carried , still comatose , in one of the evicting wagons , to a swamp four miles away known as Hurricane Bottoms , where they made camp to regain their strength or anyway their legs , and where the bandits , on their way across country to their hideout after their last exploit on the Trace , stumbled onto the campfire . And here report varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the militia recognized one of the bandits as a deserter from his corps , others said that one of the bandits recognized in the sergeant a former follower - of his , the bandit 's , trade . Anyway , on the following morning all of them , captors and prisoners , returned to the settlement in a group , some said in confederation now seeking more drink , others said that the captors brought their prizes back to the settlement in revenge for their eviction because these were frontier , pioneer , times , when  --  as Uncle Gavin said  --  personal liberty and freedom were almost a physical condition like fire or flood , and no community was going to interfere with any mere amoralist so long as lie practiced somewhere else , and the settlement , being neither on the Trace nor the river but lying about midway between , wanted no part of the underworld of either . But , like it or no , they had some of it now . They put the bandits into the jail , which until now had had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  local brawlers and drunkards and runaway slaves  --  for whom a single wooden bar in slots across the outside of the door like on a corncrib , had sufficed . But they had now what might be four ? three  --  Dillingers or Jesse Jameses of the time , with rewards on their heads . So they locked the jail this time . They did it right . They bored an auger hole through the door and another through the jamb and passed a length of heavy chain through them , and sent a messenger at a run back to the post-officestore to fetch the old Carolina lock from the latest Nashville mail-pouch  --  the lock , the iron monster weighing almost fifteen pounds , with a key almost as long as a bayonet , not just the only lock in that part of the country , but the oldest lock in that cranny of the United States , brought there by one of the three men who were what was to be Yoknapatawpha County 's coeval pioneers and settlers , leaving in it the three oldest names  --  Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Doctor Samuel Habersham , and half nurse and half tutor to the doctor 's eight-year-old motherless son , the three of them riding horseback across Tennessee from the Cumberland Gap along with Louis Grenier , the Huguenot younger son who brought the first slaves into the country and was granted the first big land patent and so became the first cotton planter ; while Doctor Habersham , with his worn black bag of pills and knives and his brawny taciturn bodyguard and his half orphan child , became the settlement itself ( for a time , before it was named , the settlement was known as Doctor Habersham 's , then Habersham 's , then simply Habersham ; a hundred years later , during a schism between two ladies ' clubs over the naming of the streets in order to get free mail delivery , a movement was started , first , to change the name back to Habersham ; then tailing that , to divide the town in two and call one half of it Habersham after the old pioneer doctor and founder ) ? friend of old Issetibbeha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a man of twenty-five , married one of Issetibbeha 's granddaughters and in the thirties emigrated to Oklahoma with his wife 's dispossessed people ) , first unofficial , then official Chickasaw agent until he resigned in a letter of furious denunciation addressed to the President of the United States himself ; and  --  his charge and pupil a man now  --  Alexander Holston became the settlement 's first publican , establishing the tavern still known as the Holston House , the original log walls and puncheon floors and hand-mortised joints of which are still buried somewhere beneath the modern pressed glass and brick veneer and neon tubes . T HE lock was his : fifteen pounds of use- less iron lugged a thousand miles through a desert of precipice and swamp , of flood and drought and wild beasts and wild Indians and wilder white men , displacing that fifteen pounds better given to food or seed to plant food or even powder to defend with , to become a fixture , a kind of landmark , in the bar of a wilderness ordinary , locking and securing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutters needing further locking and securing , not even a paper weight because the only papers in the Holston House were the twisted spills in an old powder horn above the mantel for lighting tobacco ; always a little in the way , since it had constantly to be moved : from bar to shelf to mantel then back to bar again until they finally thought about putting it on the bimonthly mail-pouch ; familiar , known , presently the oldest unchanged thing in the settlement , older than the people since Issetibbeha and Doctor Habersham were dead , and Alexander Holston was an old man crippled with arthritis. and Louis Grenier had a settlement of his own on his own vast plantation now , half of which was not even in Yoknapatawplia . County , and the settlement rarely saw him ; older than the town , since there were new names in it now even when the old blood ran in them , and you no longer shot a bear or deer or wild turkey simply by standing for a while in your kitchen door , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which came from Nashville every two weeks by a special horseman who did nothing else and was paid a salary for it by the federal government ; and that was the second phase of the monster Carolina lock 's transubstantiation into the Yoknapatawpha County courthouse . The pouch did n't always reach the settlement every two weeks , nor even always every month . But sooner or later it did , and everybody knew it would , because it  --  the cowhide saddlebag not even large enough to hold a full change of clothing , containing three or four letters and half that many badly-printed one- and two-page newspapers already three or four months out of date and usually half and sometimes wholly wrong or misinformed to begin with  --  was the United States , the power and the will to liberty , owning allegiance to no man , bringing even into that still almost pathless wilderness the thin peremptory voice of the nation which had wrenched its freedom from one of the most powerful peoples on earth and then again within the same lifespan successfully defended it ; so peremptory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galloping horse did n't even carry any arms except a tin horn , traversing month after month , blatantly , flagrantly , almost contemptuously , a region where for no more than the boots on his feet , men would murder a traveler and gut him like a bear or deer or fish and fill the , cavity with rocks and sink the evidence in the nearest water ; not even deigning to pass quietly where other men , even though armed and in parties , tried to move secretly or at least without uproar , but instead announcing his solitary advent as far ahead of himself as the ring of the horn would carry . So it was not Tong before Alexander Holston 's lock had moved to the mail-pouch . Not that the pouch needed one , having come already the three hundred miles from Nashville without a lock . ( It had been projected at first that the lock remain on the pouch constantly . That is , not just while the pouch was in the settlement , but while it was on the horse between Nashville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in three words , one of which was printable- His reason was the lock 's weight . They pointed out to him that this would not hold water , since not only  --  the rider was a --  frail irascible little man weighing less than a hundred pounds  --  would the fifteen pounds of lock even then fail to bring his weight up to that of a normal adult male , the added weight of the lock would merely match that of the pistols which his employer , the United States government , believed he carried and even paid him for having done so , the rider 's reply to this being succinct too though not so glib ; that the lock weighed fifteen pounds either at the hack door of the store : in the settlement , or at that of the post office in Nashville . But since Nashville and the settlement were three hundred miles apart , by the time the horse had.carriecL it from one to the other , the lock weighed fifteen pounds to the mile times three hundred miles , or forty-five hundred pounds . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or horse . Yet indubitably fifteen pounds times three hundred miles was forty-five hundred something , either pounds or miles  --  especially as while they were still trying to unravel it , the rider repeated his first three succinct  --  two unprintable  --  words . ) So less than ever would the pouch need a lock in the back room of the trading-post , surrounded and enclosed once more by civilization , where its very intactness , its presence to receive a lock , proved its lack of that need during the three hundred miles- of rapine-haunted Trace ; needing a lock as little as it was equipped to receive one , since it had been necessary to slit the leather with a knife just under each jaw of the opening and insert the lock 's iron mandible through the two slits and clash it home , so that any other hand with a similar knife could have cut the whole lock from the pouch as easily as it had been clasped onto it . So the old lock was not even a symbol of security : it was a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization to civilization across not just the three hundred miles of wilderness to Nashville , but the fifteen hundred to Washington : of respect without servility , allegiance without abasement to the government which they had helped to found and had accepted with pride but still as free men , still free to withdraw from it at any moment when the two of them found themselves no longer compatible , the old lock meeting the pouch each time on its arrival , to clasp it in iron and inviolable symbolism , while old Alec Holston , childless bachelor , grew a little older-and - grayer , a little more arthritic in flesh and temper too , a little stiffer and more rigid in bone and pride too , since the lock was still his , he had merely lent it , and so in a sense he was the grandfather in the settlement of the inviolability not just of government mail , but of a free government of free men too , so long as the government remembered to let men live free , not under it but beside it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jail . They did it quickly , not even waiting until a messenger could have got back fromthe Holston House with old Alec 's permission to remove it from the mail-pouch or use it for the new purpose . Not that he would have objected on principle nor refused his permission except by simple instinct ; that is , he would probably have been the first to suggest the lock if lie had known in time or thought of it first , but he would have refused at once if he thought the thing was contemplated without consulting him . Which everybody in the settlement knew , though this was not at all why they did n't wait for the messenger . In fact , no messenger had ever been sent to old Alec ; they did n't have time to send one , let alone wait until he got hack : they did n't want the lock to keep the bandits in , since ( as was later proved ) the old lock would have been no more obstacle for the bandits to pass than the customary wooden bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement from the bandits , but to protect the bandits from the settlement . Because the prisoners had barely reached the settlement when it developed that there was a faction bent on lynching them at once , out of hand , without preliminary  --  a small but determined gang which tried to wrest the prisoners from their captors while the militia was still trying to find someone to surrender them to , and would have succeeded except for a man named Compson , who came to the settlement a few years ago with a race horse , which he swapped to lkkemotubbe , Issetibbeha 's successor in the chiefship , for a square mile of what was to he the most valuable land in the Future town of Jefferson , who , legend said , drew a pistol and held the ravishers at bay until the bandits could be got into the jail and the auger holes bored and someone sent to fetch old Alec Holston 's lock . Because there were indeed new names and faces too in the settlement now  --  faces so new as to have ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor past other than the simple years which had scored them ; and names so new as to have no discernible ( nor discoverable either ) antecedents or past at all , as though they had been invented yesterday , report dividing again : to the effect that there were more people in the settlement that day than the militia sergeant whom one or all of the bandits might recognize . So Compson locked the jail , and a courier with the two best horses in the settlement  --  one to ride and one to lead  --  cut through the woods to the Trace to ride the hundred-odd miles to Natchez with the news of the capture and authority to dicker For the xeward ; and that evening in the Holston House kitchen was held the settlement 's first municipal meeting , prototype not only of the town council after the settlement would he a town , but of the chamber of commerce when it would begin to proclaim itself a city , with Compson presiding , not old Alec , who was quite old now , grim , taciturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoldering log in his vast chimney , his back even turned to the table ( he was not interested in the deliberation ; the prisoners were his already since his lock held them ; whatever the conference decided would have to be submitted to him for ratification anyway before anyone could touch his lock to open it ) around which the progenitors of the Jefferson city fathers sat in what was almost a council of war , not only discussing the collecting of the reward , but the keeping and defending of it . Because there were two factions of opposition now : not only the lynching party , but the militia band too , who now claimed that as prizes the prisoners still belonged to their original captors ; that they  --  the militia  --  had merely surrendered the prisoners ' custody but had relinquished nothing of any reward : on the prospect of which , the militia band had got more whiskey from the trading-post-store and had built a tremendous bonfire in front of the jail , around which they and the lynching party had now confederated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . Because the truth was that Comp-son , in the name of the public peace and welfare , had made formal demand on Doctor Peabody , old Doctor Habersham 's successor , and the three of them  --  Compson , Peabody , and the post trader , Ratcliffe  --  added the laudanum to the keg of whiskey and sent it as a gift from the settlement to the astonished militia sergeant , and returned to the I /olston House kitchen to wait until the last of the uproar died ; then the law-and-order party made a rapid sortie and gathered up all the comatose opposition , lynchers and captors too , and dumped them all into the jail with the prisoners and locked the door again and went home to bed  --  until the next morning , when the first arrivals were met by a scene resembling an outdoor stage setting : which was how the legend of the mad Harpes started : a thing not just fantastical but incomprehensible , not just whimsical but a little- terrifying ( though at least it was bloodless , which would have contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door nor even just the door gone from the jail , but the entire wall gone , the mud-chinked , axe-mortised logs unjointed neatly and quietly in the darkness and stacked as neatly to one side , leaving the jail open to the world like a stage on which the late insurgents still lay sprawled and various in deathlike slumber , the whole settlement gathered now to watch Compson trying to kick at least one of them awake , until one of the Holston slaves  --  the cook 's husband , the waiter-groom-hostler  --  ran into the crowd shouting , " Whar de lock , whar de lock , ole Boss say whar de lock . " T WAS gone ( as were three horses belonging to three of the lynching faction ) . They could n't even find the heavy door and the chain , and at first they were almost betrayed into believing that the bandits had had to take the door in order to steal the chain and lock , catching themselves back from the very brink of this wanton accusation of rationality . But the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that it was not the escaped bandits and the aborted reward , but the lock , and not a simple situation which faced them , but a problem which threatened , the slave departing hack to the Holston House at a dead run and then reappearing at the dead run almost before the door , the walls , had had time to hide him , engulf and then eject him again , darting through the crowd and up to Compson himself now , saying , " Ole Boss say fetch de lock " ? not send the lock , but bring the lock . So Compson and his lieutenants ( and this was where the mail rider began to appear , or rather , to emerge  --  the fragile wisp of a man ageless , hairless , and toothless , who looked too frail even to approach a horse , let alone ride one six hundred miles every two weeks , yet who did so , and not only that but had wind enough left not only to announce and precede but even follow his passing with the jeering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? probable  --  despoilers matched only by that for the official dross of which he might he despoiled , and which agreed to remain in civilized bounds only so long as the despoiler had the taste to refrain ) repaired to the kitchen where old Alec still sat before his smoldering log , his back still to the room , and still not turning it this time either . And that was all . He ordered the immediate return of his lock . It was not even an ultimatum , it was a simple instruction , a decree , impersonal , the mail rider now well into the fringe of the group , saying nothing and missing nothing , like a weightless desiccated or fossil bird , not a vulture of course nor even quite a hawk , but say a pterodactyl chick arrested just out of the egg ten glaciers ago and so old in simple infancy as to he worn and weary ancestor of all subsequent life . They pointed out to old Alec that the only reason the lock could be missing was that the bandits had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and that even three fleeing madmen on stolen horses would not carry a six-foot oak door very far , and that a party of Ikkentotubbe 's young men were even now trailing the horses westward toward the river and that without doubt the lock would be found at any moment , probably under the first bush at the edge of the settlement : knowing better , knowing that there was no limit to the fantastic and the terrifying and the bizarre , of which the men were capable who already , just to escape from a log jail , had quietly removed one entire wall and stacked it in neat piecemeal at the roadside , and that not they nor old Alec neither would ever see his lock again . OR did they ; the rest of thjt afternoon and all the next day too , while old Alec still smoked his pipe in front of his smoldering log , the settlement 's sheepish and raging elders hunted for it , with ( by now : the next afternoon ) Ikkemotubbe 's Chickasaws helping too , or anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tameless evictant children looking only the more wild and homeless for the white man 's denim and butternut and felt and straw which they wore , standing or squatting or following , grave , attentive , and interested , while the white men sweated and cursed among the bordering thickets of their punilyclawed foothold ; and always the rider , Pettigrew , ubiquitous , everywhere , not helping search himself and never in anyone 's way , but always present , inscrutable , saturnine , missing nothing : until at last toward sundown Compson crashed savagely out of the last bramble-brake and flung the sweat from his face with a full-armed sweep sufficient to repudiate a throne , and said , " All right , God damn it , we 'll pay him for it . " Because they had already considered that last gambit ; they had already realized its seriousness from the very fact that Peabody had tried to make a joke about it which everyone knew that even- Peabody did not think humorous : " Yes  --  and quick too , before he has time to advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By the pound ? " Compson said . " Pettigrew just weighed it by the three hundred miles from Nashville . Old Alec might start . from Carolina . That 's fifteen thousand pounds . " " Oh , " Compson said . So he blew in his men by means of a foxhorn which one of the Indians wore on a thong around his neck , though even then they paused for one last quick conference ; again it was Peabody who stopped them . " Who 'll pay for it ? " he said . " It would be just like him to want a dollar a pound for it , even if by Pettigrew 's scale he had found it in the ashes of his fireplace . " They  --  Compson anyway  --  had probably already thought of that ; that , as much as Pettigrew 's presence , was probably why he was trying to rush them into old Alec 's presence with the offer so quickly that none would have the face to renege on a pro rata share . But Peabody had torn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly enraged . " That means Peabody will probably pay one dollar , " he said . " Who pays the other fourteen ? Me ? " Then Ratcliffe , the trader , the store 's proprietor , solved it  --  a solution so simple , so limitless in retroaction , that they did n't even wonder why nobody had thought of it before ; which not only solved the problem but abolished it ; and not just that one , but all problems , from now on into perpetuity , opening to their vision like the rending of a veil , like a glorious prophesy , the vast splendid limitless panorama of America : that land of boundless opportunity , that bourne , created not by nor of the people , but for the people , as was the heavenly manna of old , with no return demand on man save the chewing and swallowing since out of its own matchless Allgood it would create , produce , train , support , and perpetuate a race of laborers dedicated to the single purpose of picking the manna up and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  illimitable , vast , without beginning orend , not even a trade or a craft but a beneficence as are sunlight and rain and air , inalienable and immutable . " Put it on the Book , " Ratcliffe said  --  the Book : not a ledger , but the ledger , since it was probably the only thing of its kind between Nashville and Natchez , unless there might happen to be a similar one a few mites south at the first Chocktaw agency at Yalo Busha  --  a ruled , paper-backed copybook such as might have come out of a schoolroom , in which accrued , with the United States as debtor , in Mohataha 's name ( the Chickasaw matriarch , Ikkemotubbe 's mother and old Issetibbeha 's sister , who  --  she could write her name , or anyway make something with a pen or pencil which was agreed to be , or at least accepted to be , a valid signature  --  signed all the conveyances as her son 's kingdom passed to the white people , regularizing it in law anyway ) the crawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snuff and denim pants and osseous candy drawn from Ratcliffe 's shelves by her descendants and subjects and Negro slaves . That was all the settlement had to do : add the lock to the list , the account . It would n't even matter at what price they entered it . They could have priced it on Pettigrew 's scale of fifteen pounds times the distance not just to Carolina but to Washington itself , and nobody ivould ever notice it probably ; they could have charged the United States with seventeen thousand five hundred dollars ' worth of the fossilized and indestructible candy , and none would ever read the entry . So it was solved , done , finished , ended . They did n't even have to discuss it . They did n't even think about it any more , unless perhaps here and there to marvel ( a little speculatively probably ) at their own moderation , since they wanted nothing  --  least of all , to escape any just blame ? but a fair and decent adjustment of the lock . They went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of his dim hearth . Only they had overestimated him ; he did n't want any money at all , he wanted his lock . Whereupon what little remained of Compson 's patience went too . 44 TOUR lock 's gone , " he told old Alec harshly . " You 'll take fifteen dollars for it , " he said , his voice already fading , because even that rage could recognize impasse when it saw it . Nevertheless , the rage , the impotence , the sweating , the too much  --  whatever it was  --  forced the voice on for one word more : " Or ? " before it stopped for good and allowed Peabody to fill the gap : " Or else ? " Peabody said , and . not to old Alec , but to Compson . " Or else what ? " Then Ratcliffe saved that too . " Wait , " he said . " Uncle Alec 's going to take fifty dollars for his lock . A guarantee of fifty dollars . He 'll give us the name of the blacksmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll send back there and have a new one made . Going and coming and all 'll cost about fifty dollars . We 'll give Uncle Alec the fifty dollars to hold as a guarantee . Then when the new lock comes , he 'll give us back the money . All right , Uncle Alec ? " And that could have been all of it . It probably would have been , except for Pettigrew . It was not that they had forgotten him , or even assimilated him . They had simply sealed  --  healed him off ( so they thought ) ? him into their civic crisis as the desperate and defenseless oyster immobilizes its atom of inevictable grit . Nobody had seen him move ; yet he now stood in the center of them where Compson and Ratcliffe and Peabody faced old Alec in the chair . You might have said that he had oozed there , except for that adamantine quality which might ( in emergency ) become invisible but never insubstantial and never in this world Fluid : he spoke in a voice bland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at , frail and child-sized , impermeable as diamond and manifest with portent , bringing into that backwoods room a thousand miles deep in pathless wilderness , the whOle vast incalculable weight of federality , not just representing the government nor even himself just the government ; for that moment at least , he was the United States . " Uncle Alec has n't lost any lock , " he said . ' ' That was Uncle Sam . " After a moment someone said , " What ? " " That 's right , " Pettigrew said . " Whoever put that lock of Holston 's on that mail bag either made a voluntary gift to the United States , and the same law covers the United States government that covers minor children : you can give something to them , but you ca n't take it back : or he or they done something else .

" He did not move even yet ; he simply spoke directly to old Alec : " I reckon you 're going to have supper here same as usual sooner or later or more or less . " " - Wait , " Ratcliffe said . He turned to Compson . " Is that true ? " " What the hell difference does it make whether it 's true or not ? " Compson said . " What do you think he 's going to do as soon as he gets to Nashville ?

He was n't even speaking to anyone , any more than old Alec had been when he decreed the return of his lock : " Act of Congress as made and provided for the unauthorized removal and/or use or willful or felonious use or misuse or loss of government property , penalty the value of the article plus five hundred to ten thousand dollars or thirty days to twenty years in a federal jail or both .

After a while Ratcliffe said , " What do you reckon he aims to get out of this ? A reward ? " But that was wrong ; they all knew better than that . " He 's already getting what he wants , " Compson said , and cursed again . " Confusion . Just damned confusion . " But that was wrong too ; they all knew that too , though it was Peabody who said it : " No . Not confusion . A man who will ride six hundred miles through this country every two weeks , with nothing for protection but a fox/torn , ai n't really interested in confusion any more than he is in money . " So they did n't know yet what was in Pettigrew 's mind . But they knew what he would do . That is , they knew that they did not know at all , either what he would do , or how , or when , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they discovered why . And they saw now that they had no possible means to discover that ; they realized now that they had known him for three years now , during which , fragile and inviolable and undeviable and preceded for a mile or more by the strong sweet ringing of the horn , on his strong and tireless horse he would complete the bi-monthly trip from Nashville to the settlement and for the next three or four days would live among them , yet that they knew nothing whatever about him , and even now knew only that they dared not , simply dared not , take any chance , sitting for a while longer in the darkening room while old Alec still smoked , his back still squarely turned to them and their quandary too ; then dispersing to their own cabins for the evening meal  --  with what appetite they could bring to it , since presently they had drifted back through the summer darkness when by ordinary they would have been already in bed , to the back room of Ratcliffe 's store now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewilderment and alarm ( and something else which they recognized was respect as they realized that he  --  Ratcliffe  --  was unshakably convinced that Pettigrew 's aim was money ; that Pettigrew had invented or evolved a scheme so richly rewarding that he  --  Ratcliffe  --  had not only been unable to forestall him and do it first , he  --  Ratcliffe  --  could n't even guess what it was after he had been given a hint ) until Compson interrupted ? " Hell , " COmpson said : " Everybody knows what 's wrong with him : It 's ethics . - He 's -a damned moralist . " " Ethics ? " Peabody said . He ? sounded almost . startled . He said quickly : . " That 's - bad . How can we corrupt an ethical man ? " " Who wants to corrupt - him ? " Compson said . " All we want him to do is stay on that damned horse and blow whatever extra wind he 's got into that damned horn . " But Peabody was not even listening . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait . " They watched him . He said suddenly to Ratcliffe : " I 've heard it somewhere . If anybody here knows it , it 'll be you . What 's his name ? " " His name ? " Ratcliffe said . " Pettigrew 's ? Oh . His Christian name . " Ratcliffe told him . " Why ? " " Nothing , " Peabody said . " I 'm going home . Anybody else coming ? " He spoke directly to nobody and said and would say no more , but that was enough : a straw perhaps , but at least a straw ; enough anyway for the others to watch and say nothing either as Compson got up too and said to Ratcliffe , " You coming ? " and the three of them walked away together , beyond earshot then beyond sight too . Then Compson said , " All right ; What ? " " It may not work , " Peabody said . " But you two will haVe to back me up . When I speak for the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick . Will you ? " Compson cursed : " But at least tell us a little of what we 're going to guarantee . " So Peabody told them , some of it , and the next morning entered the stall in the Holston House stable where Pettigrew was grooming his ugly hammer-headed iron-muscled horse . 66 E DECIDED not to charge that lock to old Mohataha , after all , " Peabody said . " That so ? " Pettigrew said . " Nobody in Washington would ever catch it . Certainly 1-16t the ones that can read . " " We 're going to pay for it ourselves , " Peabody said . " In fact , we 're going to do a little more . We 've got to repair that jail wall anyhow ; we 've got to build one wall anyway . So by building three more , we will have another room . We got to build one anyway , so that do n't count . So by building an extra three-wall room , we will have another four-wall house . That will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth at each stroke of the brush , like a professional Irislr groom : Now he stopped , the brush and his hand arrested in midstroke , and turned his head a little . " - Courthouse ? " " We 're going ' to ' have a town , " - Peabody said . " We already got a church  --  that 'S Whit-field 's cabin . And we 're going to build a school too , soon as we get around to it . But we 're going to build the courthouse today ; we 've already got something to put in it to make it a courthouse : that iron box that 's been in Ratcliffe 's way in the store for the last ten years . Then we 'll have a town . We 've already even named her . " Now Pettigrew stood up , very slowly . They looked at one another . After a moment Petti- o- said , " So ? " " Ratcliffe says your name 's Jefferson , " Peabody said . " That 's right , " Pettigrew said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Any kin ? " Peabody said . " No , " Pettigrew said . " My ma named me for him , so I would have some of his luck . " " Luck ? " Peabody said . Pettigrew did n't smile . " That 's right . She did n't mean luck . She never had any schooling . She didn't. know the word she wanted to say . " " Have you had it ? " Peabody said . Nor did Pettigrew smile now . " I 'm sorry , " Peabody said . " Try to forget it . " He said : " We decided to name her Jefferson . " Now Pettigrew did n't seem to breathe even . He just stood there , small , frail , less than boy-size , childless and bachelor , incorrigibly kinless and tieless , looking at Peabody . Then he breathed , and raising the brush , he turned back to the horse and for an instant Peabody thought he was going hack to the grooming . Rut instead of making the stroke , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flank and stood for a moment , his face turned away and his head bent a little . Then he raised his head and turned his face back toward Peabody . " You could call that lock ' axle grease ' on that Indian account , " he said . " Fifty dollars worth of axle grease ? " Peabody said . " To grease the wagons for Oklahoma , " Pettigrew said . " So we could , " Peabody said . " Only her name 's Jefferson now . We ca n't forget- that any more now . " Cooler in the Suburbs W IIAT can be expected of a husband and a father who can earn no more than $1,500 or $1,600 ? How is it possible for him to stem the current always running so strong against hint , especially against the refined and sensitive poor of Anglo-Saxon strain ? It is clear that he can not live in the city proper ; he must pitch his tent , as it may justly be styled , in the rear of Brooklyn , along the lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , or amid the pastures of Westchester . He must come and go daily to and from his business in every sort of weather , keeping mind and nerves on the stretch lest he miss the boat or train . His wistful life is regulated by schedule time ; he is ever hurried , planning to save a few minutes , and yet wasting , from the perpetual stress of circumstance , his entire years . He has no leisure , no repose ; he is absorbed in town , feverish in the country ; he sees little of his family , nothing of his friends ; he is engrossed with his petty affairs , which he may despise , but which he can not afford for an hour to neglect . His life is a dull , wearisome round , his most serious thought how he shall get on , and while still thinking of it , the cord snaps and the end comes . ?
