txt WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 ? The Atomic Energy Commission has asked the Budget Bureau to approve an expenditure of $8,500 , - 000 for training nuclear engineers . This amounts to adoption by at least one branch of the Federal Government of the principle of direct Federal financial aid to college students and reflects the Government 's mounting concern with the shortage of trained nuclear scientists . In the preliminary review of the A. E. C. 's budget request for next year it is understood that this figure has been cut slightly . But the principle of such aid has been accepted . About half of the grant would be used to provide what are called subcritical or nondangerous reactors for research and training purposes at several universities . The other half would go to selected postgraduate students . Single students would git $2,500 a year and married students a little more . With the White House Education Conference meeting here this coming week , the Administration has also come to the conclusion that it must make much larger requests for school-building appropriations . It was indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $1,000,000,000 over a four-year period . As in the President 's request last January , which was rejected by Congress , these funds would be allocated on the basis of " proved need and // proved lack of local income . " Details of the allocation plan were not available , however . Though the budget and State of the Union messages are now being prepared , the Administration is still engaged in a sharp debate over how much building meat for extending Federal aid to college students other than those needed in the nuclear field . For example , the President 's Council of Economic Advisers has been discussing a student aid program , although the likelihood at the moment is that almost all Federal aid will be restricted to the school-building program . Lewis L. Strauss , chairman of We Atomic Energy Commission , has insisted , however , that he can not meet his responsibilities for the development of the Atomic Energy Program unless the Federal Government greatly enlarges its system of aid to nuclear engineers . Accordingly , the Division of Reactor Development of . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research and training facilities at several universities with courses in this field . It has the enthusiastic support of the chairman . Nuclear engineering courses are now being given at Columbia University , New York University , Pennsylvania State Unitversity , Massachusetts Institute of Technology and North Carolina State College in Raleigh , N. C. , among others . The idea for the program apparently came from Dr. Lyle B. Borst of New York University . It is hoped at the A. E. C. that it will be extended considerably in the coming years . A small nuclear training program with Federal aid is now under way . Thirty-two students are taking an advanced training program at the A. E. C. 's Oak Ridge , Tenn. , facilities and thirty-two foreign students are training under the direction of the Government at the Argonne Laboratories in Chicago . Work for Experiments In addition , the A. E. C. is providing considerable funds to universities for various types of experimental work . ? Officials estimated that , in the coming budget , all forms of aid to students and universities would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I need for help in training in the nuclear field , there is some feeling that Federal assistance to students should be granted in such a way that it does not benefit just one class of students . Those who feel this way argue that subsidies to universities in the nuclear field inevitably attract students from other fields and encourage universities to establish such courses , perhaps at the expense of other subjects . The answer to this at the A. E. C. is that the need is critical and that the security of the country at this particular time depends more on nuclear engineers than on poets . Chairman Strauss outlined the problem of poor maining at the high school level this week in a speech at West Orange , N. J. He noted that 53 per cent of American high schools did not teach physics , that half of them did not teach chemistry and that many of the teachers who did teach these subjects were unqualified . Moreover , he emphasized that while English or home economics teachers were assuming the burden of trying to teach mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians had a far higher percthitage of mathematics and science students and were working much longer hours at their subjects . Thus , it is admitted at the A. E. C. that its request to the Budget Bureau is merely a stopgap program ' that does not get to the roots of the problem in the lower schools .
