This was one of the times when we moved into a bigger house so mom could take in more roomers She not only took in roomers , she was a wizard at altering cast-off clothing and making it lit her next smallest son . Each garment went right down the line . She kept us fully clothed and we usually looked clean , if not in our right minds . %Vanning , ironing and cooking were the story of her life .

As a finale , she 'd blow the one she 'd taken along to lunch at the Bailey Company , a big Cleveland department store . After lunch , mom and her youthful escort spooned up a gooey ice-cream sundae , then took the Cedar Avenue streetcar home . It was a kick to go with her .

You 'd never know that we 'd come from England . We did n't have much British self-control and reticence . When my brother Jack got mad , he walked out of the house and would n't come back for days . It worried mom to death and she 'd send me to look for him . Not that he headed straight for an opium den or anything like that . I usually found him holed up at the Y.M.C.A.

Il WWI shorter than the nighties the dolls wear today , known as " shorties , " so I must have been quite sexy in a small way . Still asleep . I walked two blocks and a half to the corner of 105th and Euclid and rapped on a drugstore door . What I had on my mind I do n't know . Maybe I dreamed I was having an affair with a double-dip sundae . A policeman recognized me , covered me with his raincoat and led me home . I woke up under him raincoat .

Mom tried to cure me of sleepwalking by tying one end of a rope around my leg and the other and to one of my brother Jack 's legs . I slept with Jack and it was her theory that if I rambled , it would wake him . As a theory it was O.K. , but Jack took exception to being pulled out of a deep sleep and finding himself being towed around the bedroom floor like a Christmas toy on a string . Ropes were always getting mixed up with my sleep . Jack and I slept on the third floor . My pal , Whitey Jennings , had a paper route with me .

Any job that needed a strong back and a weak mind was where you 'd find young Leslie Hope , pointing the profit motive like a bird dog trying out his noee for distance . At one point I sold papers on one of the corner . of 102nd and Euclid . Three of my brothers had stands on the other corners I had the Southwest Gmcery Store corner , Jack had the Cleveland Trust Company owner .

There have been times since when I with I had taken his advice . At twelve I was a delivery boy for Heirsey 's Bakery . I attribute never having been nominated for an Academy Award to the fact that I poured so much acting into that job , it burned me nut . I delivered packages in well-to-do resider-dint sections , where the eilieena amt around risking themselves , " What do you suppose the poor are doing on a 74 TIIK SATURDAY EVENING POST February 241115i day like this ?

I was knocking over quite a stack until I got absent-minded and pulled my exhaustion scene twice at the same house . The housewife got Heisey on the phone and ratted on me . When Heisey discovered that I was making more than he , he suggested that I submit my resignation . " O.K. , Mr. Heisey , " I Fetid , keeping my temper . " If you feel that way about it , I quit .

One thing we could do free was go swimming down on the lake front . I understand that 's been fancied up now . They wear bathing suits . When I was thirteen , I had another job , in a flower stand at Luna Park , an amusement place with roller coasters and love tunnels . Thal flower stand had a tie-in with one of those garnet huilt around tossing celluloid halts into a hole , three belle for a dime . If you tossed one in , you won a flower ; if you sank two , you took home half a dozen ; if you hull's-eyed three , they gave you the whole stand .

Then , when I grew a lit tle older  --  in my late teens  --  as El 111101.1 hustler . I pushed shoes in the shoe department of Wm . Taylor Sons and Co. department store . They gave their shoe salesmen a " premium " if they managed to sell a certain hard-to-move style shoe they had in stock . We were supposed to gain the confidence of a customer , then sell him a brace of those boots . It was good training . There 's still a premium for selling an old routine to as TV sponsor . ca n't recall what came between the Taylors and me , but evidently something did . The Taylorastillremember it .

The foremen , named Whitehouse , was a baritone singer , and it was n't long before we held it men's-room audition and assembled a quartet of service-department employees . Al times we grudgingly stopped singing barbershop long enough to fill a few orders . There was is boom on , zillions of Chandlers were Belling , life was fat and sassy . I guess it was sassy of us to record our singing on the day manager 's dictating machine , then stand and listen to ourselves , entrnnced . We did several numbers in this way . But we made a mistake . One night , afteradmiring our voices , we forgot to break the record we 'd made . Next morning , when the day manager switched on his machine to begin his " Dear Sir : Yours of the sixteenth received and contents ' noted , " 1w not only found himself listening to a quertot he did n't know he had , he heard a few remarks about what a jerk he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chandler Motor Car Company .

" In fact , " I said , " after the first show 1 did for him , he stood out in the alley and pointed out those places . " In addition to our paper route , Whitey Jennings and I worked up a chirp rout ine . Whitey had a good voice , but I was something special , a combination soprano-tenor who knew no range limit . We sang for kicks around the neighborhood and down at the corner after supper when the arc lights hissed and sputtered overhead . But when we tiring in front of the apartment buildings on 101st Street ? a classier reeidenOld neighborhood than ours ? the cliff dwellers there threw coins down at us .

Discovering that even this primitive branch of the entertainment business paid off opened up a new world for me . When I made money singing , I used part of it to buy the boys on the corner is ercritn . Holiman 's Ice Cream Store concocted 13 tasty thing called a Tin Roof Sundae . It was chocolate ice cream , thick chocolate sirup and peanuts on top . It was the best ice cream I 've ever Lasted . In later years , whenever I went back to Cleveland , I dropped in there and stabbed two or three Tin Roofs to death with a spoon . Hoffman 's tinnily went out of business , but my stomach still screams for the ' Aug they sold . Sometimes we took one of the nickels Hung at us from an apartment and blew it on sitting in is nickelodeon to worship Doug Fairbanks . Doug was our boy . We even tried to grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls yelled for their mammas when I leered at them . An hour or two after a Doug Fairbanks picture , 1 was Doug . Inspired by his gymnastics , Whitey and I used a delivery-wagon umbrella as a parachute , jumped from the top of the two-story-high Alhambra Theater building . Fortunately , we were loose-jointed physically as well as mentally , and we landed in a pile of /mind , so that , ! imide from having our teeth jarred , we were n't hurt . Even before the money tossed from apartment-house windows , Charlie Chaplin imitations had made me show-business conscious . I 'd put on my Chaplin make-up and walk duck-legged to the corner past the firehouse , twirling a rattan cane and flapping a pair of battered , oversize oboes . Amateur Charlie Chaplin contests had hit the country 's theaters like a rash , and I got so good at it that I was persuaded to enter a contest at Luna Park . To make sure that I won , my brothers rounded up all of the neighborhood kids and look them along to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his band over the head of first one contestant , then another ; then he 'd cock his ears for the sound of acclaim . When he held his hand over my head , the noise sounded like Indians screeching . The result was a new cooking stove for mom . It was the No. 1 prize . The singing I 'd done with Whitey and at the Chandler Motor Car quartet came in handy when I went to work for my brother Fred at his butcher stall . Fred 's stand was one of fifty or more in a market that looked like n g , ient Quonset hut . The market housed vegetable , meat and fruit stalls . The butchers in the market liked music , so they hired a hand and built a stage for it over the Matte . Then they urged Fred and me to get up and sing with the band . If we wandered oil ' key , the butchers hanged the refrigerator pipes with their cleavers . But working for Fred was n't all sing-ing on a platform above the stalls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour Fred tossed me n key and mid , " Run down to the locker in the basement and bring me up a hind quar-ter of beef , will you ?

I found myself i my 8. staring into the face of a small animal that looked as if it hated everybody . I do n't remember whether its eyes were red or not ; all I knew was it seemed to have nine of them . I ran upstairs yelling , and the butchers and customers were thinking of throwing a net over me and sending for the man in the little white cont to take me away , when they discovered what had thrown me into a panic . The butchers had chipped in , had bought a ferret and had put him in the basement to keep down the rats . All I can say is , if you 've never met a ferret socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of a little animal like that ! " Fred said to me reprovingly . " He does n't take up much room .

" I took some of the money I earned and tried to improve my ( lancing by taking lessons from a colored man named King Raslus Brown on Central Avenue . He did a machine-gun routine with a cane that was a honey . He 'd point his cane at the audience and make a rapid rat-tat-tat sound with his feet . After working with him for a while , I 'd go in for amateur nights , hoping to pick up a first prize of ten dollars or a second prize of five dollars . 1 did all right , except when my teacher himself was one of the entries .

When I was about nineteen , Johnny Root went off to California for his health and let me take over his dancing classes . I remember the cards I had printed : LESLIE HOPE WILL TEACH You How To Dasca  --  Clog , Soft-Shoe , Waltz-Clog , Buck and Wing , and Eccentric . The upshot of all this was that the last year that I worked for Fred at the butcher stand I was n't much use to him Saturday nights ? the only night the Mond was open . I was torn between two different kinds of ham . At seven o'clock I put on my derby , tapped its curling hrim into place with a snapping forefinger , and announced in superior tones , " Sorry , I have an appointment with my public . " Then I 'd saunter off to play a vaudeville date , with my best girl and dancing partner , Mildred Rosequiat , under one arm and my music under the other . Together , we 'd make seven or eight dollars playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we kissed . She did n't really mean to kiss me . I tricked her into it . We were drinking out of the same fountain and I turned the water off . Before long , I gave Mildred up  --  another way of putting it is to say that Mildred 's mother got the notion that I was n't the divinity-student type and she refused to trust her daughter on theatrical tours with me . So I teamed with a kid named Lloyd Durbin . Together , we signed on M4 song-and-dance men with a traveling , capsule musical production known as a tab show . Our tali bore the cheery title , Hurley 's Jolly Follies , for Fred Hurley , who owned it . I want to talk a lot about tab shows . Being in them was exciting to me. and remembering them is exciting to me now . They were a special part of show business with a flavor all their own . Hurlers Jolly Follies played on it famous tab show circuit called Spiegel-berg Time . We also played Gus Sun Time . Gus Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been in vaudeville remembers him . The Gus Sun Circuit was smaller than the Orpbcurn or the Keith Circuit , but it was important in our business . Sun would pay headliners good money and supplied talent for so many theaters that he could work an act all year . For that matter , you could stay on Sun Time for five or ten years . You would n't make a fortune , but you 'd make a good living . He booked Lab shows into such theaters as the Dixie in Uniontown , Pennsylvania , and the Lyric in Morgantown , West Virginia . There were never any wildly enthusiastic crowds to greet t.4.9 when we arrived in a town , and our bus never had to pull in in a protective crouch . Morgantown was the home of Kathleen O'Shea , a pretty girl who was also in the Jolly Follies . When I sighted Kathleen , I filed Mildred Roseiluist and coined a phrase for the way I felt about Kathleen  --  a phrase I was sure nobody had ever used before . " This , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be homely dolls named Kathleen or cold types named O'Shea . If so , I 've never met one . There 's a law that girls with such names are pert , bright-eyed , irresistible . Chances are if Kathleen had been muddy-cheeked and thick-tinkled , I would n't have had the run-in I had with the manager of a hotel in Bedford , Indiana . There 'd been another tab show in Bedford ahead of us the week before , and this other troupe had tossed a wing-ding every night . As a result , the hotel manager was disgusted with show folk . When we arrived , he instructed our manager , " Tell your people to keep quiet and let my tenants sleep or it 's the stream for you . " I contracted a had chest cold in Bedford , and Kathleen suggested that if I 'd come up to her room she 'd give me some hot salve to rub on my chest . That night , after the show , I went uplita in ( to her room . She was just giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" I just  - -   - -   " He pulled a gun , let it dangle by his side , and repeated , " Get downstairs ! " I do n't remember whether I used that helve or not . Things were pretty hot the way it was . In all fairness , that Hurley outfit was an orderly group . Some of them , like Gail Hood , and Bud Brownie , and Frank Maley , were married and had their wives with them . There were only a couple of hooters among us. characters who went for paper hats and noisemakers . My partner , George Byrne , looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio . I 'd drawn George when my first partner , Lloyd Durbin , had died of ptomaine poisoning after eating tainted pie halfway through my first season with Hurley . Kathleen finally quit the show , went home to Morgantown , West Virginia , and opened a dress shop . You might say that we opened it together , since I helped finance her . When Hope and Byrne finally hit the big town to wait for fame and fortune , I pinch-hit as her New York buyer . I 'd cruise up and down Seventh Avenue picking out the $ 0.75 and $16.75 items . I had a vaudevillian 's sense of style . To me , chic meant snappy , so some of those Morgantown girls must have looked unusual when they dolled up in numbers I 'd selected for them .

We placed ourselves in front of a big mirror over the fireplace and clattered through our dance steps , watching our reflection to see if we were working smoothly together . During one such interlude , I taught myself to play Yee , Sir , That 's My Baby on an upright piano . while George stood on top of the piano , plucking a banjo strung like a Wm . In my two seasons with Htirley 'm tabs , I did n't double in brass . Hut I did double in quartet .

Frank Maley would come up to me afterward and say , " O.K. , so it 's funny . But do n't ruin the number with your hyena laughing . " The next time he was more severe . " Stop your laughing , Hope !

George and I had made up our minds to work up an act good enough for the big time . We wanted to be like two of vaudeville 's greatest all-time characters . Duffy and Sweeney . Sweeney 's first name is Fred . I see him around Paramount from time to time , where he still does bits in pictures .

If Sweeney won , he 'd say , " Do n't give Dully any money . He drinks . " If Duffy won , vice versa . The winner would draw the whole week 's pay for the act . Show people loved Duffy and Sweeney 's routine . They ley under the piano and sucked lollipop ' and did things nobody else had enough nerve to do , but they were too crazy for the average audience . I remember seeing them once at Loew 's American in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . They 'd come out with a few eggs , a frying pan and an electric toaster . They 'd remove one of the footlight bulbs , plug in the toaster , fry eggs on it in the pan and eat their breakfast while they were doing their act . But to get back to Detroit , where George and I were breaking in our new act . Not only were we sure we had exactly what the big time needed , we were so elated about our dizzy leap from $100 to $225 a week that it made us dizzy too . We wnlked around in a gold-plated dream , mentally spending our loot . Russ Morgan and his band were playing at the State , where they were a fixture . The M.C. was Fred Stritt . During one of our rehearnids with Rues and Fred , n stagehand told " about n gambling place just across the street . We perked up our ears like Couple of not overly bright mules . " What happens there ? " I asked . " They 've got the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything you want to play , they 've got it . " So between us , George and I lost our Ravings before we even opened at the State . After that , we did our four shows a day with the zest and bounce of a , brace of zombies . The audience could n't understand why the management had hired two performers with no personalities at all . If we seemed preoccupied , it was because we Spent all of our time on stage trying to invent " winning systems . " Finally we had a lucky day , got even and quit . We stayed in Detroit for a couple of months , playing different ' beate ' . Then n Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , agent , Ed Fishman , booked us into I he Stanley in Pittsburgh with To ' Henry and his North Carolinians . It was the custom for a theater to hire a favorite orchestra leader and keep him around indefinitely , like Paul Ash in Chicago and Phil Spitalny in Cleveland . We got $300 at the Stanley . RO we were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cocked and aimed at the big time . We even bought a new theatrical trunk . We 'd had to rope our old one together to get it from one jump to the other all in one piece . One month we almost went broke on rope . But finally we bought an H. &; M. trunk To n vaudevillian , having an H. &; M. was like having sterling engraved on your bottom  --  if you were a teapot . We also Ilossied ourselves up in the costume department . We bought Eton jackets and big white collars . We had beautiful high-wnisted pants and white spats . We had high hats and black canes with white tips . All solid class . Our act opened with a soft-shoe dance . For this we wore the high hats and ; mate and carried the canes . Then we changed into a fireman outfit by taking off our high huts and putting on Wait papier-mache fireman ha 61 . George hod a hatchet and I had a length of hose with a water bulb in it . We danced real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempo , while the drummer rang a tire hell . AI the end of this routine we squirted water from the concealed bulb at the braes section of the orchestru in the pit . It not only made an attractive finish but it had the added advantage of half drowning u few musicians . We could n't believe it at fret , but the big time proved a shifty target and we had to scurry around audition* our act and sniffing for elusive bookings . Keith 's gave us a few tryouts at places like Keith 's Flushing  --  the kind of tryouts for which you were paid the minimum salary so they could see your act . Then we got a job dancing with Daisy and Violet Hilton , the Siamese twins . The biggest factor in our landing that job was the wardrobes we 'd bought . Abe Last fogel , now head of the William Morris Agency , saw our photos in our snazzy getups and booked us on those alone . Summoning us to his office , he told us , " If you 're only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We did our own act in the second spot on the bill  --  known to the trade an the deuce spot  --  then came hack later to dance with the twins . Al first it was a funny sensation to dance with a Siamese twin . They danced beck to lock , but they were wonderful girls and it got to be very enjoyable  --  in an unusual sort of way . The only thing wrong with it . wits that we had to do too many shows a day . The twins ' uncle  --  who was also their manager ? would n't give us a raise , so we finally bounced that . Between jobs , George and I Metered at a flea-bag hotel with a generous credit policy . We picked one near the Palace Theater , in cage we got a hurry call to conic over end save it from n financial panic . We lived on the thirteenth floor of the hotel . I do n't know why any hotel should have a thirteenth floor , especially one populated by people looking for work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest double-bed room in hotel history . It was impossible to squeeze two beds in , but they did it . One day we were waiting for the phone to ring with an offer when the actor in the room next to ours committed suicide . We heard him clunk as he fell against the wall . His body was wedged between the bed and the wash basin , and they had to bring in the fire department to open the door and pry him loose . I 'm a lit tie hazy as to the method he chose for self-destruction . I never knew whether it was poison , strangulation with a sheet , or a razor . Probably the latter . A few years later , when the first electric razor was put on ruffle , I rushed out and bought one . Anyhow , it was a pretty grucentne example to set a young team out of work . Vaudeville eventually sickened . Its trouble was a creeping atrophy of the box-office muscles induced by the Iwo viruses , talking movies and radio . This no-customer disease reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherin , tells about this fellow who once owned a little night club in the San Fernando Valley just over the mountains from Hollywood . You seldom saw any people in there except on week ends , and everybody wondered why it stayed open . Sometimes business was so had on week nights that the owner bought everybody n drink , then closed up . One night when he walked in there were no mummers at all , so he said , " Slam the door . I 'm going home . " Reaching home earlier than usual , he walked in and found his wife necking with another man . " Oh . boy ! " be said . " People ! " and went out into the pantry and shook up a round of welcoming drinks . But lmck when George and I were trying to get started . there was nothing weak about vaudeville . It was a rough , tough and rugged way to earn your cakes . Even with the arrival of an occasional lemon pie , baked , boxed and mailed to me by mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinnest man iii vaudeville . I was down to 130 pounds . When I wore one of those short tOpOitiits so popular at the time , I looked like a group of loud checks walking on Milts . In the vaudeville of those days , you came out battling and you protected yourself at all times . If you did n't , the other acts flattened you . You even had to watch your partner . When I played the lnter-state Time in Texas later as an M.C. , the Cirillo Brothers were an act on my bill . The Centime were four Italian boys who rang and danced . They were hot-tempered , and one night in Dalian while I was introducing them , they had a terrific row backstage and kicked up such ti commotion I could n't make myself heard . Asking the audience ience to excuse me , I went backstage and said , " Sh-h-h . I 'm trying to tell those people out there how lovable and attractive you boys are . " They subsided and I went back on . When I finished my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as 1 introduced the next act , the backstage racket started again . When I finished the introduction , I went back once more and asked , " What 's eating you anyway ? " It came out then . They broke down and told me the reason for their wrangling . The night before , one . if the brothers had taken one bow more than the others . Vaudeville as I knew it was full of extroverts , exhibitionists and " **35;4473;TOOLONG " characters . If one of us made the big time we had 301E DOA 1.1 , Es NOW PLAYING THZ Oarticum TIME painted on our spare tire . We did n't want to keep such important news from the world . " Vaudeville " and " headliners " are spelled with the name number of lettere , but the team of Hope and Byrne give no thought to the fact that " heartbreak " was also impelled with the same number of lettere . We were to find that out before very long .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
