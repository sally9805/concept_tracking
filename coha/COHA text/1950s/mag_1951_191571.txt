In some of its early clinical efforts , the Senate 's Kefauver crime investigating committee seemed interested only in examining the lumps , warts and old tattoo marks on the body politic . But in New York last week , it was intent on deeper surgery . Though its hearings were closed , and could only be followed by buttonholing the doctors at the operating-room door , the committee 's interests were plain . It wanted to know all about 1 ) Underworld Kingpin Frank Costello , and 2 ) former Mayor and present U.S. Ambassador to Mexico William O'Dwyer . <P> Costello was called in to testify twice , for a total of 7 hours . He appeared dressed in the quiet good taste of a Wall Street broker , seemed in fine spirits ( his briefcase , he told reporters , contained nothing but " two bottles of whisky and a pair of pajamas " ) , and acted as though he had just dropped in to see some old pals . The Senators were equally polite . Committee Counsel Rudolph Halley let it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had given information on a dozen politicos of both parties , which was " full of meat , " and had only balked at one mysterious " $64 question . " <P> What Was Going On ? The committee 's references to the former mayor ( who invited one of its investigators to take testimony from him in Mexico City last week ) were also on a diplomatic and neutral plane . Beyond revealing O'Dwyer 's statement that he had met Costello only once , and then in obedience to an order when he was a World War II officer investigating war frauds , the committee publicly made no attempt to link the two men . <P> But the list of subsequent witnesses made it obvious that the committee was going further in checking tie-ups between crime and politics ; that it was well aware that officials of O'Dwyer 's regime ( some of whom were involved in recent fire-and police-department scandals ) had demonstrated such an uncanny propensity for getting into hot water that millions of New Yorkers wondered just what was going on before he resigned . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Anastasia and his brother Albert , the rich Brooklyn mobster and onetime Murder , Inc. suspect who never stood trial , although District Attorney O'Dwyer once described the Anastasia case as " the perfect murder case . " They failed to corral Gambler Frank Erickson ( who preferred to stay in his Rikers Island cell , where he is serving a two-year rap for bookmaking ) . But the committee pulled in Underworld Big Shot Meyer Lansky , Gamblers Gerard Catena and James ( " Niggy " ) Rutkin , who entered the hearings protesting : " I 'm small peanuts . Why do n't these Hollywood investigators retire and get J. Edgar Hoover up here ? He 'll tell them all they want to know in two days . " The committee also called two of O'Dwyer 's intimate friends , <P> Water Supply Commissioner James J. Moran ( whose testimony was considered " vague " ) and ex-Deputy Police Commissioner Frank Bals ( who seemed " sort of hazy " ) .                 @ @ @ @
