This remarkable husband-and-wife team produce tailor-made political campaigns ? and they nearly always win . But for several peculiar reasons , their methods seem unlikely to spread very far beyond their state 's borders . IN THE weeks before last November 's election , a menacing-looking monkey wrench suddenly became a political weapon in California . The unlovely object was flung across billboards , newspaper ads , garish handbills ? accompanied by the slogan , ' ' Defeat the Monkey Wrench Tax Bill . Vote No on 17 . " Proposition 17 was a complex measure which proposed to rejigger the state 's tax system by reducing the sales tax , lowering income tax rates on modest incomes , raising them to 40 per cent on incomes over $50,000 . The measure was of doubtful wisdom , to put it mildly , but it was not precisely a monkey wrench either . The monkey wrench motif , and the " fear campaign " which it dominated , bore the unmistakable touch of Whitaker and Baxter , the remarkable San Francisco husband-and-wife team who have long been the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first in the field in the early ' thirties , have since run eighty major campaigns -- winning all but six . In the last dozen years , they have paid personal income taxes on over a million dollars . The American Medical Association alone paid them a fee of $350,000 for a strenuous crusade against compulsory medical insurance . Their performance in the 1958 election measured up to the Whitaker and Baxter legend . Proposition 17 was defeated after a brilliant campaign that threatened Californians with the wreck of the state 's entire financial structure and ? what was perhaps even worse ? the imposingof burdensome new taxes on food , real estate , and gasoline if the Monkey Wrench passed . While they conducted this crusade in Northern California , Whitaker and Baxter also found time to handle a successful statewide campaign for Proposition 4 ? a $60 million harbor bond issue ? as well as to run Governor Knight for U. S. Senator . They dropped Knight after the primary ? because he had refused to follow their advice . He insisted on attacking Knowland , his running mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not many press agents , one can assume , feel sufficiently secure to fire a Governor . Whitaker and Baxter , however , have an exuberant respect for their own political wisdom ? and they hate a loser . The November results vindicated their judgment : Knight lost badly . By this time , Whitaker and Baxter have been fixtures of California politics far longer than anyone in high state office . Clem Whitaker is a tall , spindly man with a deeply-lined , craggy face who looks older than his sixty years . Ile is something of a non-stop talker in a low , well-modulated voice that is oddly reassuring . Wife Leone Baxter , by contrast , is a surprisingly youthful fifty-two , a pretty redhead with the well-scrubbed , glowing complexion of the ageless American girl . She too is never at a Toss for words , though her tone is sprightlier and she often sounds on the edge of breathless discovery . For a pair of old pros , Whitaker and Baxter are full of surprises . They relish talking about their coups , but betray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their view , professional campaign management is an ennobling effort to raise the level of political awareness in a democracy . " We feel , " Whitaker says solemnly , " that people in our state are better informed , more alive to the issues , are better citizens because of our type of activity . " They carry on these educational chores in close unison . At work , the accordion wall is kept open between their carpeted , paneled offices . A visitor who telephones one will often find himself talking to both partners simultaneously . ' Whenever they have a lecture date , they both perform on the platform . They share profits equally , sign letters together , seldom use the first person singular when the plural will do . There is some division of effort , however . Whitaker usually plots Iong-range strategy , while Baxter invents slogans and labors over pamphlet copy . They both write speeches and hate the job . Before an interviewer , each is meticulous in pointing out the specific contributions of the other , but neither likes to be upstaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both leap forward to answer and will interrupt each other frequently . Clem Whitaker comes naturally by his tone of moral uplift . His father was a Baptist preacher , an uncle a Socialist Baptist preacher . A precocious youngster , Clem covered the California legislature for the Sacramento Union at seventeen , became city editor at nineteen . For a period he was a correspondent for the San Francisco Examiner , then in 1921 launched the Capitol News Bureau ? a political news service for papers around the state which did not have their own Sacramento correspondents . He had worked up to eighty subscribers and was netting $25,000 a year when he sold out to the United Press late in 1929 , He had suffered a difficult siege in the hospital and decided that public relations would be an easier way to make a living . Whitaker ran some minor campaigns ( including a vain effort to abolish capital punishment ) before he came upon Leone Baxter in 1933 . She was a demure widow of twenty-six who had written a little newspaper copy and now was manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought them together was a referendum over the Central Valley Water Project , an irrigation and flood-control development which had been authorized by the legislature . The Pacific Gas and Electric Company , alarmed because the power generated might he sold to public authorities , then forced a referendum . At a meeting of supporters of CVP , Whitaker and Baxter were urged to take on the campaign . It was a tough fight . Pacific Gas was well heeled , but the other side could scrape up less than $40,000 for Whitaker and Baxter ? a sum they would now regard as laughable . They concentrated their energies on the small towns of central California , which would directly benefit from the project , and did a skillful job of gettingtheir propaganda into small-town newspapers . They also made the first extensive use of radio in a state campaign , handling everything themselves ? from the production of scripts to sound effects . When the returns were in , the Central Valley Project had triumphed by 33,603 votes . Impressed by this performance , Pacific Gas and Electric later put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a client to this day . WE WERE SORRY WE HAD TO DO IT THAT WAY C L E M and Leone were now launched as a partnership , though they did not marry until 1938 . Their second year , 1931 , established them as a formidable team . Not only did they put over George Hatfield as Lieutenant Governor , but they had a large hand in defeating old Socialist Upton Sinclair , who was running for Governor on the Democratic ticket with a bizarre program to End Poverty in California , which thoroughly alarmed conservative citizens . A quarter-century later , W Fc B are admittedly embarrassed to talk about the Sinclair campaign . " It was one we hated to handle , " says Whitaker . " Sinclair was an old friend of the Whitaker family . It 's always difficult to fight a campaign against a man you like personally . " Half the Whitakcrs stopped talking to Clem . W ft- , B took the job , they insist , because they regarded Sinclair 's program as a great menace . Hired just two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast job , we had to make a drastic change in public opinion . " Their strategy was the ultimate in what might be called the diversionary technique ? shifting attention from Sinclair 's program to his personal foibles . " Upton was beaten , " Clem says candidly , " because he had written books . " For three days , Clem and Leone secluded themselves with Sinclair 's lifetime production , compiling a mass of damaging quotations . Then they hired an artist named Bill LeNoire who did a series of thirty cartoons on " the blot of Sinclairism , " in which generally a dismaying quotation would be embedded in a big blob of black ink and flung against some typical scene of American felicity . Thus , bride and groom , emerging from church , are assailed by a Sinclair comment that in capitalist society the institution of marriage has the qualities of " marriage plus prostitution . " Or the picture of a madonna and child is defiled by Sinclair 's observation that " of a score of religions in the world ... each is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a huge black ogre labeled " Communism " looms behind Sinclair as he harangues a glowing idealization of Miss California . The Communist charge was frequently thrown at Sinclair , though in that regard he was quite blameless . Whitaker and Baxter had mats made of the cartoons , shipped them to papers around the state . At least 3,000 appeared in print . " Sure , those quotations were irrelevant , " says Baxter . " But we had one objective : to keep him from becoming Governor . But because he was a good man , we were sorry we had to do it that way . " After their imaginative assault on Sinclair , Whitaker and Baxter found themselves in increasing demand . They have handled as many as six campaigns in a single year . They turned back the repeated assaults of the Single Tax , the $30-every-Thursday movement of the /ate ' thirties , the weird pension proposals of " Gorgeous " George McClain , the Garrison Revenue Bond Act , and an effort to reapportion the legislature . They won an anti-featherbedding drive against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times persuaded California 's voters to raise teachers ' salaries , elected one Mayor of San Francisco , kept another from being recalled , ran three successful campaigns for Goodwin Knight , one for Earl Warren . They have handled but one Democrat , George Reilly , who was defeated for Mayor of San Francisco . Whitaker and Baxter , incorporated as " Campaigns , Inc. , " brought a new approach to political public relations . Long before their advent , politicians and pressure groups had of course hired press agents to write speeches and puff their causes in the papers . W B , by contrast , provided the entire management of a campaign ? overall strategy , organization , financial supervision as well as publicity and advertising . California provided an excellent market for these services . Its peculiar cross-filing system ? allowing Republicans and Democrats to run in each other 's primaries ? had effectively undercut party identity . A mushrooming population , nonpartisan municipal elections , and a dearth of patronage made it impossible to build stable political machines based on precinct organization . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each election the individual voter had to be continuously harangued about a multitude of complex issues . Cross-filing and the initiative and referendum , ironically , were reforms of the progressive Republican administration of Hiram Johnson . They were designed , in that distant era before World War I , to break the power of the old-lineparty machines . They achieved their purposeevenrually at the expense of producing chaos in California politics and making politicians more dependent on the mass media than elsewhere in the country . In California , the great game of politics turned into a branch of public relations . Year-round the Whitaker and Baxter operation numbers no more than twelve people ; at campaign time it is likely to expand to fifty . The firm charges $25,000 to $75,000 to handle a statewide campaign , but this fee is supplemented by the /5 per cent commission charged on advertising placed for clients . ( W B have their own advertising subsidiary . ) Annual income is further increased by fees for the public relations " counseling " which occupies the firm between campaigns ; its clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told , W 8 B gross about $250,000 a year ? exclusive , of course , of the money they expend on behalf of their clients . It is not unusual for a statewide referendum campaign to cost $500,000 . The firm 's success can be credited to a variety of factors : shrewd strategy , thorough organization , and an imaginative exploitation of all the media of communications . By the time one of their campaigns is over , the unwary citizenry has nearly drowned in propaganda . Some years back , Whitaker calculated that in a typical campaign they employed ten million pamphlets and leaflets ; 50,000 letters to " key individuals and officers of organizations " ; 70,000 inches of advertising in 700 newspapers ; 3,000 spot announcements on 109 radio stations ; theater slides and trailers in 160 theaters ; 1,000 large billboards and 18,000 or 20,000 smaller posters . THE PARTNERS PAUSE TO THINK THINGS OUT W H E N Whitaker and Baxter take over a campaign , they absent themselves from the office for a few days to work out a detailed Plan of Campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the issues to be stressed , the types and volume of publicity and advertising to be used ? and the timing of each thrust of propaganda . As a guide to their own strategy , W &; B frequently formulate an Opposition Plan of Campaign . They also prepare a budget . The client ? generally a committee ? guarantees the total sum and Whitaker and Baxter handle all disbursements . If the treasury runs low , W &; B arc in a position to advance as much as $100,000 out of their own funds , thus avoiding any slack58 THE SUPERSALESMEN ening in the pace of the campaign because of financial stringencies . Few public relations firms are in this enviable position . A basic part of the strategy of any campaign is to undercut as much opposition as possible in advance . Early in 1958 , W B confronted a difficult problem ? how to win a referendum in support of a $50 million bond issue to improve the Port of San Francisco . The trouble with this estimable undertaking , they felt , was that only San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire state would have to approve . True , the bonds would be repaid out of revenue , and hence would cost the taxpayers nothing ? but this was not an easy thought to get across to more than six million voters . " The more you have to explain , " Clem Whitaker says sadly , " the more difficult it is to win support . " Their solution was enterprising . One morning at breakfast , Leone read a newspaper story about another bond proposal ? a $10-million issue , also self-liquidating , to expand small-boat harbor facilities throughout California . From the look of things , the small-boat bill seemed unlikely to pass the legislature . Whitaker and Baxter had no passion for amateur boating , but they suddenly saw a way of enhancing the attractiveness of their own measure ? namely , by amalgamating the two bond proposals . They mobilized their supporters at Sacramento , got a new bill passed , and were then able to go to the state with a proposal to improve scores of harbors from the Oregon border to Mexico . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " newspaper ads , radio and TV spots ? arid the voters responded hand somely . " A good example , " says Whitaker , " of how you can win a campaign in the board room ? long before it starts . " The design of each campaign is different , but all share certain basic similarities . Timing is very important . A cardinal W B rule is to allocate 75 per cent of their budget to the final three or four weeks of a campaign , when the din of contention has finally aroused the voters . Repetition is equally important . " We assume we have to get a voter 's attention seven times to make a sale , " says Whitaker . " That 's an arbitrary figure , of course , but repetition is the only way to swing someone from no position to an affirmative position . " Every campaign must have a dominant , arresting theme . " The theme , " Baxter has explained , " should have simplicity and clarity . Most of all , it must high-point the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that paints a picture understandable to people in all circumstances . " Simplicity , of course , can verge on over-simplification and even fantasy . The Truman Administration 's proposal for compulsory medical insurance was , for better or ill , exactly what the term implied . W R , however , found it more helpful to crusade against " socialized medicine " ? a term which they have conversationally abandoned , now that the fight is won . In 1950 , California 's voters were presented with a scheme to pay old-age pensions out of the proceeds of legalized gambling . The plan was poorly conceived , but Whitaker and Baxter , who led the opposition , did not confine themselves to attacking its absurdities . Instead they pitched their entire campaign on the theme , " Keep the Crime Syndicates Out ! " But nobody had suggested that the crime syndicates be let in . For each theme , Whitaker and Baxter can of course provide a rationale : compulsory medical insurance would lead to socialized medicine ; legalized gambling could lead to corruption- The virtue of a slogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship that a hypothetical threat becomes an immediate threat . In its printed propaganda ? that is , in the small print ? W Rc B will spell out their rationale . Thus , in 1958 , their newspaper ads warned that if the Monkey Wrench Tax Bill passed , the state would have to impose new taxes on real estate , food , and gasoline in order to raise needed revenues . But their highly effective TV spots eliminated the argument and merely demanded , " Do you want to pay a state property tax on your home ? " Loud voice in background : " NO ! " Announcer : " Then vote NO on Proposition 17 ? the Monkey Wrench Tax Bill . " Campaigns are dominated by themes and themes are in turn highlighted by " gimmicks , " a term which AT 8e B themselves apply . The Monkey Wrench Tax Bill was one such attention-getter . So was the song " I 've Been Loafing On The Railroad " when they were campaigning in 1948 against the full-crew law on trains . It was sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as caption for a widely distributed cartoon of a railway employee lolling in a bed atop a freight car . HOW TO LOOK AGGRESSIVE T ORPOR is the norm in politics , in the view of Whitaker and Baxter . " The average American , " Whitaker once sadly informed a PR audience , " does n't want to be educated ; he does n't want to improve his mind ; he does n't even want to work , consciously , at being a good citizen . But there are two ways you can interest him in a campaign , and only two that we have ever found successful . " Most every American loves contest . He likes a good hot battle , with no punches pulled . . . . So you can interest him if you put on , a fight ! .. . Then , too , most every American likes to be entertained . He likes the movies ; he likes mysteries ; he likes fireworks and parades .... So if you ca n't fight , PUT ON A SHOW ! " The show must never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its thematic simplicity . " Even when you 're on the defensive , you must appear to be aggressive , " says Whitaker . This is not always easy . In 1946 , W Sc B were campaigning to prevent the recall of Mayor Roger Lapham of San Francisco . A recall cam-paign , unlike an election , does not involve two or more candidates slugging it out . There is no opponent ? just the public official defending his record against his detractors . An intolerable situation , W Sc B felt ; their solution was a brilliant improvisation ? Mayor Lapham ns. the Faceless Man , a sinister type with his tilted derby completely obscuring his face , whom they labeled " The UndercoYer Candidate for Mayor . " The Faceless Man , whose non-face was smeared across billboards and newspaper ads , became a target as vicious as any opponent Lapham might have flailed against . Lapham won . The success of a campaign , W &; B believe , is not only dependent on its aggressive pace and streamlined themes . It also requires grass-roots organization for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In each campaign , the firm spends a good deal of energy rounding up its " natural allies " ? local and statewide organizations which have either a direct or peripheral interest in the issue . Thus , in its 1958 campaign for the harbor bond issue , W &; B naturally received endorsements from the Pacific American Steamship Association , the various maritime unions , the California Marine Parks and Harbors Association , and the California Boating Council . But it ventured much further afield ? mobilizing such groups as the California Rifle and Pistol Association , the Associated Brick Manufacturers of Southern California , the Fresno Cotton Exchange , the Chambers of Commerce of over forty cities , and the Orange County Farm Bureau . By the end of the campaign , over 150 organizations had affirmed their approval of Proposition 4 . A concerted effort is made to win the editorial support of newspapers . There is nothing subtle about the approach : W Sc Ws missionaries button . hole editors in their offices . When the firm was fighting a **27;1447;TOOLONG proposal made by Governor Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gratifying : Warren 's proposal lost around thirty of its fifty supporters , and the numbers of papers in opposition increased from about one hundred to 432 . W 8c B do not overlook the helpfulness of advertising in encouraging favorable editorial attention . Reporting in July 1946 to its client , the California Teachers ' Association , as one of its pay-raise referendum campaigns got under way , W Sc B stated : " Every newspaper in the state has received a check to cover 60 inches of advertising space , reserved for our use during the month of 60 THE SUPERSALESMEN October . The individual papers were advised that the schedule was made possible by the teachers in their own communities ? and you can feel very confident , I believe , that no editor is going to develop a distaste for teachers generally or for their publicity stories as a result of it . " Further to increase good will , W gc B do not charge small papers the normal 15 per cent advertising commission . WHAT THEY DID FOR THE AMA A L T H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California , Whitaker and Baxter have proved that the techniques developed there can be successfully applied nationally . In 1948 , the American Medical Association , alarmed at the Truman Administration 's campaign for compulsory health insurance , retained Whitaker and Baxter to turn back the threat . The partners went to Chicago , recruited a staff of around forty people , spent $4,678,000 over a three-and-a-halfyear period . Their approach was strategically sound : organized medicine had to offer a positive program to counter the Administration 's plan . Under W &; B 's prodding , the AMA for the first time enthusiastically backed voluntary group-insurance plans , which provided a persuasive slogan ? " The Voluntary Way Is The American Way " ? with which to belabor " socialized " medicine . Whitaker and Baxter then set about to mobilize the nation 's doctors to arouse their patients , friends , and every variety of local organization to the Socialist threat . An enormous asset , of course , was the network of county and state medical societies around the country . Chicago headquarters provisioned them with canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . In 1949 , over 54 million pieces of literature were distributed , in 1950 over 43 million . In one two-week period in October 1950 , the AMA spent SI , 100,000 in newspaper and radio advertising ( more than $2 million was also spent by sponsors of tie-in ads ) . No angle was overlooked . The personal physicians of Congressmen and Senators were approached to solicit their votes . Doctors who knew newspaper editors were asked to request their support . Over 10,000 endorsements of the AMA position were received from local organizations . These were promptly released to the press and brought to the attention of the President , Congressmen , Senators , and state legislators . In the 1950 Congressional campaign , while the AMA officially remained on the sidelines , " Healing Arts Committees " of doctors and dentists were organized to campaign against advocates of the Murray-Wagner-Dingell bill . The ' Socialists " were clobbered . So was their bill , Whitaker and Baxter could boast , with pardonable pride , that they had organized the " greatest grass-roots lobby in history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now several political PR firms in California , some of whose principals ? like Herbert Baus of Los Angeles and Harry Lerner of San Francisco ? received their training in Whitaker and Baxter 's shop . Alumnus Lerner , in 1956 , handed W &; their stiffest defeat on an initiative measure to " unitize " California 's oil fields and thereby limit oil extraction . W &; B , retained by the " major " oil companies , argued that it was a salutary conservation measure . Lerner , representing the " independents , " attacked it as a restrictive measure designed to favor the huge monopolies . W &; B 's campaign was temperate ( friends said they were rest --  fined by their clients ) , Lerner 's attack was slashing ? in a fashion reminiscent of his old mentors . His most effective gimmicks , displayed on billboards and ads , were two symbols for the " oil monopoly " ? a hog wallowing in oil and a whale swallowing up the independents . His printed copy and TV spots were equally rough ? and he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT ON W II ITAKER and Baxter do not alibi their defeats , but they are of course happier talking about their victories . They have great zest for their work , a quality which they in large part ascribe to conviction . " A campaign is too demanding if your heart is n't in it , " says ' Whitaker . They have never been political neuters , willing to sell their talents to the highest bidder . Republicans from the start , they have regularly worked the conservative side of the street , though certain of their campaigns ? like those raising teachers ' salaries ? had equal appeal for liberal-minded citizens . Dedicated Republicans , they rally spontaneously to any cause which champions Free Enterprise , Personal Initiative , Freedom , or the American Way . Their personal rhetoric at times has a quality of Boy Scout piety , but is so insistent that it inevitably carries the ring of sincerity . Whitaker is fond of Lincoln 's statement , " Public sentiment is everything . With public sentiment , nothing can fail ; without it , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes to create that sentiment , " Whitaker has argued , " we can recall that some of the greatest statesmen in American history went to extremes , too . It was Lincoln who said : This government can not endure permanently half slave and half free . ' That 's what we call ' a fear campaign ' . . . a picture of dire things to come , unless the issue is resolved . And it was Patrick Henry who said , ' Give me liberty or give me death ! ' That 's what we call laying it on with a ladle . . . even in these modern times , that is the kind of dynamic sloganeering that molds public sentiment ? and wins campaigns . " These protestations are hardly persuasive . The sad fact is that their mass manufacture of slogans and wielding of ladles has lecl to a grievous debasement of political debate . It is true that political appeals , long before W B entered the scene , were hardly distinguished for their intellectual sobriety . Oversimplification of issues , attribution of base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most irrelevant ad hominem arguments have long flavored the rhetoric of democratic debate ? especially at election time . Whitaker and Baxter 's peculiar contribution , however , has been to make a precise art of oversimplification , to systematize emotional appeals , to merchandise the images they create through a relentless exploitation of every means of mass communication . Compared to these virtuosos , the old-time politician seems like an amateur . WE 'VE MELLOWED I N THEIR more reflective moments , the partners occasionally betray some anxiety about the inadvertent effects of their work . Asked whether they have ever been disturbed at the tactics they have had to employ , Whitaker replied solemnly , " We search our souls to be sure we are not using tactics that will do damage to society . " Baxter was more troubled : " We 've felt that many of our methods have been used by the most dreadful people ? like dictators . The only protection is that people in this business are decent . " The conversation turned again to the campaign against Upton Sinclair . " We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Whitaker sighed . " I guess we 've mellowed ? but on the other hand , we have n't been faced again with the same kind of fight . " Whatever the character of the fights ahead , W Pc . B can look forward to a secure future . The political atmosphere peculiar to Californiawhich first nurtured their talents still exists : the lack of strong party organization , the personal character of many political contests , the enormous number of initiative and referendum issues at every election will continue to provide a ready market for their services and those of competing firms . This despite the fact that the cross-filing system , which frequently nullified the value of party affiliation , has recently been on the way out . For the last few years , a Democrat or Republican cross-filing in the other 's primary has had to list his own party label on the ballot , which greatly lessened the chances of capturing both primaries . This past April the legislature finally passed a bill abolishing cross-filing entirely . Thus party labels have begun to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , has not brought into existence strong party organization on the traditional model ( despite the growth of influential Democratic Clubs around the state ) . Even if they lost political candidates as clients , which seems unlikely , the professional campaign firms could still keep fully occupied with the endless initiative and referendum campaigns . Outside of California , the Whitaker and Baxter type of operation has not emerged ? nor does it seem likely to . The main reason is that party organization is stronger than in California , even in an era of decline for the big-city machine . To hire a PR firm to manage an entire major campaign would involve an unthinkable degree of abdication for a self-respecting political leader . PR people are of course involved in major campaigns in other states . In recent years , they have been put to increasing use and , depending on the prestige of the individual performer , their advice is often taken on issues of policy . But except in isolated instances they are not granted the range of responsibility which W Sc B take as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the techniques which the California firm pioneered have of course spread throughout the country . The 1952 Presidential campaign ? and more particularly the 1956 one ? saw a sophisticated effort to merchandise politics with all the gimmickry of advertising and public relations normally applied to the merchandising of soap . We can expect that no future Presidential campaign will be able to dispense with the five-minute TV speech , the thirty-second spot , the canned interview , and the carefully scripted political rally ? complete to Hollywood director and three name bands . Whitaker and Baxter can reasonably boast that they have led the way .
