You think Miss Mattie Sue wears pants ? " " I never looked into it , " Jimmy Tallant said . " Have you ? " " Never looked into it . " There was a long silence . Jimmy Tallant turned to warm his back , then turned again . " Well , Willard . I hear that Duncan 's in the saddle now . " " ' Swhat I hear too . " " You moving out ? " " No . Staying in to help him . Duncan 's all right . I got nothing against him . " " I got nothing against him either . Except he thinks he 's Jesus Christ . " " Does he ? " Willard glanced up .

" " Only he was n't , " Jimmy said coolly . " He was talking to Duncan Harper . " " Duncan Harper . What did he ever do for Travis ? Listen , whenever Travis could n't run for sheriff by law because by law he could n't succeed himself , I ran for sheriff for him , but it was him that was running and it was him that was always sheriff , and everybody knew it . I never grudged him . " " Yeah , " said Jimmy , " and when Travis needed a nigger woman , you found a nigger woman for him . " " I went there that day , " Willard recalled .

' The next morning he paid Clem Gates for the Frigidaire , out of his own pocket . " " What 's Ida Belle doing these days ? " Jimmy asked . " Nothing , " said Willard . " She plays nigger blues on the Stromberg-Carlson Travis gave her . There are those that have been up there . But nothing doing . Nothing . Never will be . I 'll bet money on it . It 's the way Travis was . Never another one to fill his bed , or his shoes either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had me a Stromberg-Carlson to play . Instead , I got to show a groceryman what to do with a poll-tax receipt . " " I would n't be surprised you 'll be doing a few more things than that , " Jimmy Tallant said . His tone had not changed , and Follansbee did not look up . Only in the way his hands and face stilled was it apparent that he knew that Jimmy Tallant had stated his business . " I might , " he said at last . When he looked up , through the silence , Jimmy Tallant was holding out his hand . Willard did not take it . " I was just thinking the other day , " he said to Tallant , " that now I 'm going to be doing a good many things Travis used to do , and it do n't seem right not to be getting Travis 's check . " " You might have something there , " said Tallant . " Might ai n't do , " Willard returned . " I 'll say this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's job and yours too , you ought to be getting more .

Mattie Sue Bainbridge returned , hugging herself with cold . Behind her , relaxed and silent as a thought of himself , came Kerney Woolbright.  | He shook hands with Follansbee and Tallant in turn . " When 's Duncan coming over ? " Kerney inquired . All sorts of spiteful things occurred to Willard , but he only said , " Tomorrow , I think . " " Do n't seem right in here with Travis gone , " Kerney said . The two men eyed him . They knew what he was up to , he a college man , a Yale law graduate , going to marry Cissy Hunt if it killed him , going around shaking hands and saying the commonplace thing . They did n't fall for it , but somehow they did n't challenge it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them that he was as sharp about them as they were about him . Maybe a little sharper ? They doubted that . He thrust his gloves in his overcoat pocket and warmed his hands over the stove , a little too exactly like anybody else . Tallant especially surveyed him with the eye of an old actor for a young one . It was Mattie Sue who answered him . She said that it certainly did n't seem right , that every few minutes she caught herself thinking that was Mr. Travis just shut the outside door , and once she looked up thinking she actually saw him come in  --  she was all by herself with nobody else in the office , and it actually scared her . She actually thought about closing up and going home , but somebody came in . Kerney heard this through with such sober attention that she wished there were more to say , and suddenly thanked him for the coffee he had bought her at the drugstore . She observed the two other men watching her and blushed , then began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was something in Kerney for everybody . 10 A Phone Call Cognizant of the merits of the dial system , Kerney went home and telephoned Duncan . " Anybody in the store ? " he asked .  | " Nobody but me and W.B. I 'm closing for lunch . " " I 'd get rid of Follansbee , " said Kerney . The wire was silent for a moment . " I ca n't , " Duncan said . " Sure you can . " " I ca n't add insult to injury , Kerney . He loved Travis like a hound dog . I told him he 'd be staying on to help me . " " Yes , and what thanks do you get ? He 's in there this morning conniving with Tallant . " " What about ? " " You know what about , Duncan . You would n't take protection money from Tallant . " " Willard knows my policy . " " Do I have to bore a hole in your skull ? Do you think Willard 's going to respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to give him the chance . " Kerney could see Duncan as plainly as if he had gone to the store ( which he had n't wanted to do because the eye of the courthouse would follow him as certainly as God 's own ) : Duncan warming his hand on the cat 's fur , and the colored boy across the room like a maharajah 's lackey , cross-legged on the sack of chicken feed , probably picking his nose . Did n't everybody know instinctively the decent thing to do ? Why must Duncan Harper have the gall to insist on actually doing the decent thing ? Kerney knew within an ace what Follansbee would do : the thing that irritated him was that Duncan knew it too . Still , he was for the moment compelled to see what Duncan saw  --  the Follansbee so ugly , so poor , so unimportant , the aging drugstore cowboy , the third best shot at the pool hall , for whom life , like a lucky throw , had suddenly added up  --  its soundlessness suddenly filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the glamour of guns , all because Travis Brevard had looked at him one day and known what he would like . And Travis in death now stood present with Willard , bright as a saint in his simple and adoring heart . A man with his capacity for devotion must have his chance . For what ? For honor ?  | " Okay , " said Kerney . " Okay , okay , okay ! " He hung up and that was when he saw her , his mother , standing in the door with that proud little smile which said how well he looked in the gray suit . " Good God , " Kerney flared . " I thought you were shopping in the Delta . " " I changed my mind , " she said . " You heard everything I said . You could have let me know you were there . " " I do n't have to let anybody know I 'm in my own house , " she returned , passing by him , her feelings hurt . He caught her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you heard just now , it 'll be your own house for sure , all by yourself , because I wo n't be living in it any more . It was that important , do you understand ? No college campus doings any more . I make you a promise : if you tell this , I leave . " " I 'm not going to tell anything , " she said . " I did n't hear anything you said anyway . I was n't even listening . I was thinking how well you looked " ? her voice caught ? " in your gray suit . " " A likely story , " Kerney said . " You did n't lose two husbands over nothing . " " They did n't leave me ; you know very well what happened . I left ? " But he had gone upstairs and slammed the door . He gave himself a ten-year limit to be in Washington , and no eavesdropping woman who thought he was a clever child was going to keep him down . If that was love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she married him . She would . Duncan had lost Marcia Mae , but Cissy would marry Kerney Woolbright . Whom did she know that was better ? Nobody . And on the heels of his confidence , fear came and touched a finger to his heart .  | 69 The Raid Tinker did not know a thing about politics , as she kept on saying , but she did know that one night two weeks after Miss Ada turned over the sheriff 's office to Duncan , the National Guard came up from Jackson to Winfield County to raid the Grantham-Tallant roadhouse . It was misting rain , and cold . The jonquils were in bloom and the flowering shrubs had put out ; but now everything would be nipped . About ten-thirty Kerney knocked on the door . She heard him stamping on the doormat and , switching on the porch light , she marked the rime of white on his shoulders and hat brim , and beyond him , outside , the sparse wet white dots lancing down the dark . " Snow ! " she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the yard , lifting her face skyward and holding out her bare arms . Kerney watched her , smiling , and started to follow , but she came right back in , running with a slightly mannered little gaiety that was nonetheless attractive . " It wo n't stick , " she said . " The ground 's not frozen . " " It never does . " " Sometimes . Once when we were children there was a big sleet and snow here for three days . I expect you were too young to remember , Kerney . They turned out school and none of us went home that I remember for a week . We made sleds and skis and played everywhere . Everything was different . Duncan and Jimmy and Marcia Mae Hunt and I went out rabbit hunting together and all got lost from each other . Come on in , Kerney . Duncan 's not here , but he 'll be back . " " It 's as bad as being a doctor 's wife for you now , I guess , " Kerney said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put on , to keep her spirits up , little gold lounging slippers and velveteen slacks . She  | was practically positive that Kerney already knew where Duncan was . " It could n't do any harm to tell you now , " she said . " They 're raiding the highway place tonight . " " Who ? " " The National Guard . " She spoke with confidence , though she had no idea on earth whether there were five of them or five hundred , whether they had come in convoy trucks and dressed in olive drab with guns at their feet , the way you used to see GI 's moving toward maneuvers during the war , or whether they were in policemen 's uniforms , riding in long black patrol cars with the slender aerial whipping sinuous and bright from the left rear fender . She decided on the black cars and imagined their soft pneumatic shimmer through the dark , the glimmer of the snow that melted when it touched the black metal . " You do n't think anybody will get hurt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was Follansbee along ? " " I do n't know . Duncan would n't tell me anything at all until just before he left . Let me get you a drink . " " No thanks . " " I 'll have one then . " The drink was half gone when Duncan returned . There were no long black cars with him , no men in uniform , not even Follansbee . His Chevrolet sedan skidded and gave an angry snort entering the drive . He came in laughing . Tinker was cross-legged on the floor before the fire . Only her eyes moved to him . He stripped off his overcoat and shook hands with Kerney . " How did it go ? " Kerney asked . " It seems , " said Duncan , " that everybody has got Tallant and Grantham wrong . You know how they make a living ? They sell Coca-colas , Orange Crush , Dr. Pepper , and hamburgers , and they charge a little bit , dollar a couple , for people to come and dance  | to the juke boxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Winfield County ? One half-pint bottle belonging to old Mars Overstreet who runs that little country store . He keeps it there for a cold . He 's a deacon in the Baptist Church and was right embarrassed that we caught him with it . And he really does have a cold . " Kerney 's mouth tightened . " I knew this would happen . I told you . " It was worth a try , " Duncan said . " I had to give Willard a chance . " " You did n't owe him a chance . You did n't owe him anything . " " Well , " Duncan said mildly , " he has more stake in the sheriff 's office than anyone I know . " " He 's no more than the hired help . Travis tolerated him . It 's no more his business than anybody else 's what you decide to do . " " I think it 's probably more his business than it is yours , " Duncan said . " You do n't know anything about politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this out like it was a football game . You want to give everybody a break and play it clean . Did anybody ever offer you anything to throw a game ? " " Hundreds of people . " " But you never took anything . Nothing . You think you can work politics that easy . " " I knew it ! " Tinker said . " I just knew you 'd all be fussing . " " As a matter of fact , " Duncan said , " I did take something once . A wrist watch . When I found out it was meant for a bribe , I gave it back . " " I 'm sure you did . " " Kerney , there 's no use getting worked up over this . " " I 'm sorry , Duncan . It 's only that I 'm for you . I 'm tired tonight . I 've been straining myself all day to keep out of work , and it 's worn me to a nub . For God 's sake , do n't take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together here , we 'll both stand by ourselves , because there 's nobody else we can stick with and be sure of . " I believe that , " Duncan said . " I 'm tired too . Let 's shake on it that way and forget it for now . " Kerney met his clasp with a good grip . " I best get home , " he said . " I 'm Mother 's baby boy and she waits up with the porch light on . " Duncan turned back from the door , saying to his wife , " He is a baby , you know . It would be too much if it did n't dawn on him every once and a while . " He came to the fire . Tinker 's head came level with his knee and he pressed it close against him , moving his hand caressingly through her short dark hair . But he was not thinking of her . He was still out there on the highway where exciting things had been going on for the first time in maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried again to see it all : black cars , men in uniform , neon reflections on the wet gravel , and the occasional glint of snow . The men in uniform were heavy and handsome and she asked him suddenly , " Was Marcia Mae out there ? " In her hair his fingers stopped still . " Yes . How did you know ? " " I just thought she probably was . " ... He did not dare at the moment , considering Tinker 's mood , to remember fully the sight of the Cadillac convertible on the outskirts of the parked cars , or the arm in the window , propped straight up with the hand against the car roof , that way she always put her arm when she was behind the wheel and the car was standing . Then the bare length of wrist between the sleeve and glove , white as the snow  --  the sculpture of it jumped at him and said it was she . He got a remarkable thrill of pride , not thinking she had stopped on his account especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be curious and not ashamed of curiosity , to happen along and then not pass by . She was game and she was , in her curiosity , ageless : little girl , woman , old woman , with the bright interested undemanding eyes that missed nothing . In that  | moment , looking toward her from where he had stopped in the lighted door of the roadhouse , he was overcome with a delight that was all innocence . He was glad that he had known her and loved her and that she had loved him , and for the first time he could take the thought of what she had done without resentment , could step right straight into it and toward her , quickly crossing the gravel , threading among the cars . As he approached , the white shadow back of the arm grew as firm as the wrist . He leaned against the window . " Nothing here , " he said . " Nothing ! " " Nothing . It will be the same everywhere . " " Follansbee , " she said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had to give him a chance . It 's no surprise . " " I see how you felt . " " He would have been sheriff if it were n't for me . " " I see . " " Marcia Mae , I came over to tell you that it does n't make any difference to me any more that you ran off and married somebody else . " " It was an awful thing to do to anybody , " she said . " I just could n't help it . There was nothing personal about it , though . " " Well , " said Duncan with a wry laugh , " I do n't know how personal you can get . " She laughed too . " I mean I would have done it to anyone , for " ? her chin lifted ? " for Red . " " I 'm sure he was a great guy . And I 'm sorry , Marcia Mae , about ? " " Thanks . " The short silence that followed was certainly the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm glad you do n't hate me . I could n't stand that . " " Hate you ? Listen , I do n't even dwell on it any more . I think you 're just a hell of a fine girl , that 's all . I came to tell you ? "  | " You cared the other day , " she said . " That day uptown . I could tell it . You resented ? " " I know . " " Then when ? ? " " Just now , when I looked up and saw your arm in the window . I knew it was you . You always stop that way . It came over me that I did n't care any more . Why ? I do n't know why . Because I was glad to see you . That 's all . " " Glad to see me ? " she repeated . " Yes , glad . Mighty glad . " " Oh . " In the second silence , he knew he should have gone away during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " I got a complaint , sheriff , " Jimmy Tallant said . " One of them big soldier bastards tilted my Miami Beach Bathing Beauty Contest pinball machine and all the lights on the breasts went out . I think you ought to go have a look at it . I heard you was pretty good at fixing up radios , juke boxes , that sort of thing . You might as well accomplish one thing during the evening . " " I 'll get you yet , Jimmy , " Duncan said pleasantly . " You know that , do n't you ? " " I 'll lay money on it , " Tallant said . " I do n't make big money , " Duncan returned , " so I ca n't afford to win big money . But this is just one time I missed , Jimmy . There 'll be other times . " Tallant leaned his face down to Marcia Mae . " Where do you stand on this , old buddy ? " " I side with Duncan , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that gratitude ? After all the whisky I 've got at cost for you . Tell you what , Marcia Mae . Soon as these folks hit the road , let 's you and me have a drink up close to the stove . If Duncan wo n't bet with me , maybe you will . " " I might have a drink with you at that , " she said . " It 's snowing , " Duncan remarked .  | Marcia Mae held out her hand . " Snowing . " She smiled with sudden charm . " Do you remember the time , Duncan , when you and I got lost out in the woods that big snow we had when we were in high school ? " " What do you mean , you and Duncan ? " Jimmy demanded . " I was there and so was Tinker . We all got lost , from town and from each other . " " That 's so , " said Marcia Mae , " but who found us ? I forget . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a nigger house I knew , and Marcia Mae hollered her way toward me with Duncan not far behind . " " And I went back and found Tinker , " Duncan said . " She was crying , down by an old stump . " " I remember now , " said Marcia Mae . " Yes , " said Jimmy , " we found each other .... " So it now seemed to Duncan that every time in life he came on Tinker she had contrived to get herself below knee level . Maybe she looked cute and felt right on the floor , but it made him feel like a fool . " Get up , " he demanded . She came up quickly , like the good dancer she was , rising further than her feet , all the way to the tips of her toes , with that startling quality of lightness she had , as though she had shot up through water . Her eyes were dutiful . " Tinker , " he said , " we are not going to start quarreling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last ten years . The first time was the other day in front of the post office . She happened to be uptown . The second time was tonight . Why she was there I do n't know , but I ought to know her pretty well and I can guess . She saw something was going on and she was curious and ? " " And brave . " She said it instantly , and it made him mad . His jaw tightened , but after a moment he forged ahead . " As for what she did to me , it was terrible at first . It would be for anybody . Later it all boiled away and cooled . There was nothing left but a scar in my mind somewhere . But tonight when I saw her  --  this is important , Tinker  --  I knew that I did n't care any  | more one way or the other . I knew that as the person I used to know , she just did n't exist any more , not for me . " " Not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , now , that 's different , Tinker . And not fair . Lots of women are attractive ; I ca n't help knowing that . The other way around too . Tallant , for instance . You are n't ever in any doubt ? " " Tallant ! He 's got nothing to do with this . " " Well you started it , honey . You brought up Marcia Mae . I only thought I 'd get it said once and for all , so things would n't pile up before we knew it . " " I did n't start anything at all , Duncan . All I asked was if Marcia Mae was out there tonight . You could have answered yes or no . " " All right then . I thought you started it . I thought you had more in mind than that . I was mistaken . " She sat curled in the chair now , the big soft one : she could get as much out of its comfort as a kitten . She was fiddling with a little steel puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to eat Crackerjack . She was also observing his rather monumental efforts at complete honesty . Tinker 's father and stepmother lived in south Mississippi in what Tinker called " the most expensive pigsty in the world . " They had a swimming pool and several long cars and a station wagon with the name of the estate written on the door . They gave drinking parties and so did all their friends . When they were all together , they told dirty stories , and when they separated the men talked oil production and cursed the Fair Deal and the income tax , while the women gossiped . Tinker 's own mother had left her father back in the days when people thought all the oil was in Oklahoma and Texas , and when instead of being filthy rich he was filthy poor . Not that she wanted him back . She had returned to her girlhood home , which stood empty , one wintry fall afternoon , leading Tinker by the hand . There was a red glow among the trees , which stood black  | and wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drenched in red . Tinker 's mother hoisted her in through a window and she unlatched the front door . Indomitable , she called a Negro in off the road to build a fire , and after that sent him , protesting and laboring as though against a physical force , into town for some groceries from Harper 's store . She cooked cheese crackers and toast in a Dutch oven and made hot chocolate on the hearth . There was molasses too , so thick and cold a knife could slice it . Nothing had ever tasted so good . Later they sat on the floor before the fire and played crokinole . The house was not really hers but nobody could stand to move her out , and she was still in it when her ex-husband 's oil money bought it for her . She was in it now . She was a tall thin woman with no figure at all , and heavy hair as dark as the day she married , wound in a rope around her head . Her eyes were gentle , clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If there was anything Tinker did not want to do , it was to go live with either of her parents . At the same time she knew , while she sat in the chair and solved the Crackerjack puzzle , that she was closer to it than she had ever been before . 12 Jimmy Tallant 's Wife " Whisky and sex , " said Jimmy Tallant to his wife . " That 's all there is . Whisky and sex . Not even money . Nobody cares about money , only the best way to throw it away . The best kind of whisky . The right kind of sex . You do n't believe it ? All right , take away whisky and sex and tell me the history of Lacey , Mississippi , since ' seventy-five . Eighteen seventy-five , that is .

" Here I make you a speech that Kerney Woolbright could ride to the senate like coasting in on a pair of angel 's wings , and all you have to ask is whether the governor 's boys rated any cash . Well , I 'm not going to tell you . You do n't get out that easy . You got to tell me that one thing . One historical fact . " He raised a finger . " Historical . " She tried not to laugh . She ground her swollen body down under the pile of blankets and , lips quivering , put the magazine she had been reading when he came in ( a detective magazine full of pictures of beauties like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , up close . She thought he was the cutest , funniest thing she had ever seen in her life . Then , before she knew he had moved from across the room , his long steely fingers closed painfully on her hand .

' " Bud Grantham , her father , had really said that . As if to prove him right , she went off into giggles . Jimmy hitched up his pants legs and sat down on the edge of the bed as impersonally as a doctor . Then he bent her hand backward into her wrist . Her laughter ended in a gasp . " One fact I asked for . One fact I get . " " The Monroe Doctrine , " she said , wild-eyed . This hurt . Did n't husbands sometimes murder the beautiful women ?

We did n't have much . We went to school in the buggy . " " I remember all that .

" " Daddy 's a good man , " said Bella . " I think Daddy 's just a real fine man . " " Ummm , " said Jimmy Tallant . ... A real fine man . He remembered the old cropped bur head hunched down low and the leathery face , which was exactly the same color as his khaki shirt , bent frowning toward the floor , for it always embarrassed him to talk seriously about any woman to another man , much less about his daughter who was already an embarrassment to him .

" What Bud Grantham had in mind when he said " high-class women " was his second wife , a high-heeled , swivel-hipped woman from New Orleans who claimed to be a Creole and draped herself in a fake French accent and , on occasions , not much else . She had disappeared one night  --  come closing time they could n't find her  | ? though she had waited on sonic plush customers from California headed for Florida , and there was not much doubt what had happened . It seemed a funny way to go to Florida , up 82 , and Jimmy kept an ear cocked for quite a while , but he never heard any more . He idly recalled that he had slept with the woman , and reflecting on the ways of sex which always lay like a senseless tangle of roots below the surface of the ground , he thought wryly that if he had known Grantham 's first wife he might have to be wondering not only whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" " Oh . " Grantham sank back . He was sitting on top of the desk in the office , right back of the roadhouse . " That there was a grudge fight they fetched Herman up for . They had no call to meddle in it . " " They will do that , " said Jimmy . " Yeah . " Grantham was getting sleepy too : he yawned , rubbed his eyes , then righted himself decisively .

She 's my little girl , Jimmy , and I 'm your best friend , boy . Where 're all the fine ones you growed up with in Lacey ? What did they do when they got through admiring the chest full of decorations you brought back with you from across the water ? Did anybody offer to take you in as partner ? Nobody but ole Bud ? " " Oh , cut it out , " Jimmy said . They were both well aware that it was Jimmy 's father who thirty years before had led the gang who shot the Negroes down in the courthouse . Jimmy never knew when people were thinking about this and when they were n't . All his life it lay in the back of his mind except during the war when he flew the planes and did the heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lacey because he figured his father had done their dirty work for them once , and then they had turned on him . The Tallants had had a most uncertain status since  --  or was it all settled and nobody had thought to tell them ? Jimmy did n't know . He knew that he and his brother and sister had run with the nicest people who sooner or later had told them what had happened . He was aware of vital statistics : his parents had died ; his brother had been killed early in the war ; his sister had married out of the state and moved away . He had rented the old house , ignored his aunts and cousins , drunk too much , and never cared for any girl but a nice little nobody  --  Louise Taylor , the one they called " Tinker , " old Gains Taylor 's daughter . He had cut a path for the bombers over Germany , and thousands died . He had returned a hero , but his girl  | was already married . She had gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everybody 's love . When Marcia Mae Hunt had deserted him , Duncan had only to turn his head and call Tinker 's name . So what better was there to do , he asked himself , than to go into business with a man he had always liked , a man whose family had been for generations bootleggers , hunters , trappers , owners of small country stores and tiny crazy-shaped farms . He judged wryly that this was where he belonged ; he would say to anybody that the Granthams were the cream of Winfield County . So the match with Bella was a natural . Was it , and everything else in his life , an outgrowth of what his father had done ? He did n't know . He saw it in any case as a joke on Jimmy Tallant , and as such he could accept it . " Cut it out , " he repeated . " I 'll give you the business before I 'll start crying . I 'll marry her , sure . ' thy not ? .. : " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " do n't you ever mention those niggers to me again . It was my daddy that led the gang that did it . " Her eyes got big . " You did n't know that ? " he asked her . " Seems like , now you mention it , I did hear something about it , long years ago . " " You mean folks do n't talk about it now ? " " I do n't know . " She was honest as an animal . " I do n't know any folks that would . " " I reckon not . " " I always say , " she said , " let bygones be bygones . " He did not hear her . " In the army , overseas , " he told her , " I been known to drink with niggers . Some would be together with us at the same party , or maybe enlisted men too , shut up in a pub together during an air raid . That would be a kind of party . We 'd get to talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , the niggers and me , from the Yankee boys that would always be bringing up the Civil War . Do n't fool with me , ' I 'd say ; my daddy shot twelve niggers dead in one afternoon between two and two-fifteen . ' Then they 'd  | all laugh , black and white together , thinking I 'd strung the long bow again , because if you talk to Yankees they never hear you ; all they hear is the accent , so they figure nothing you say could be important , or even true . If it was Yankees he 'd shot instead of niggers , they 'd have a statue to him in the courthouse yard and I could put on my string tie and lay a wreath on it , every Memorial Day . But let it pass . " One night in a pub during the buzz-bomb raid , I said those words , Do n't fool with me , ' I said , and the rest of it , and from way out in the corner there after they stopped laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice a whole lot flatter than mine said , It 's the truth . His daddy shot them dead . ' I said , Where you from and what 's your name ? ' He said , I 'm from Winfield County , out on the old Wiltshire Road near the covered bridge . My name is Sergeant Beckwith Dozer . ' Then everybody hit for cover because it was going to be a near one , and just when the silence carne I walked to the door and outside . They yelled after me , but I was tight , and the way it had all turned up that way , sudden and sharp , I wanted to be right under the damn thing when it fell . If he had n't said that about the old Wiltshire Road and the covered bridge . But he knew it , too , see ? Knew what would get me where I lived . A nigger always does know how to work you . He knew how to get me through that door ; though the rest of them shouted after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice I never heard . The earth rattled and shook me down flat , so I thought I was dead . But I woke up in the night , not even scratched , and walked on back home . The next time I saw him was on the Lacey square and the war was over . But he remembered and I did too , and the bastard grinned , remembering the time he nearly killed me . Do you think if it had worked he would have lost any sleep ? Not Sergeant Dozer . " " Beck Dozer , is that who you mean ? The one who 's all time hanging around ? " " He 's a good man to have . Do n't ever get the man who claims  | to like you to do your work ; get the man who hates your guts , because he 'll see you in hell before he 'll show himself to you as anything less than the best . Sure , he hangs around ; he does whatever I might happen to need him for . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet . " Pull down the shade , " he said . When she leaned to do so , she screamed and jumped out of bed . " That nigger ! " she cried . He was across the room at once , taking his revolver from the desk drawer . She caught hold of him and clung to him , pointing back toward the window . Her knees were literally knocking together . " Turn me loose , Bella . What nigger was it ? " " That Dozer nigger . The one you were just talking about . Quick . IIe 's going , do n't you see ? " " What was he up to ? " " Walking close by the window . Looking back over his shoulder . " " Did he stop ? " " Yes . No . I do n't know . Quick and you can catch him . " " Not if you do n't let go of me . " He steered her to the bed and set her gently down . " Take it easy . You want to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupped his hand to his eye , peering out . He called Beck 's name twice , then lowered the shade , returned to his desk , and replaced the gun . She was quaking under the cover , making noises like a puppy . He began to laugh . " You wanted me to shoot him , Bella ? You actually did , did n't you ? You wanted me to shoot a nigger . All for you . " " It was scary . It was so . It scared me half to death . I do n't like niggers . I 'm here alone so much of the day , way out here in this house by myself , way out from town , way out on the highway . There 's niggers everywhere . Anything can happen . Look at me shake . " " I 'll see him tomorrow , " he said . " Get over . Tonight I 'll sleep  | by the window . " He covered her with another blanket and tucked it round , all she needed to make her happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked him about the incident . " I crossed through your back yard , Mister Tallant , " Beck said . " It happened to be the shortest way home . " " Do n't do it again , " Jimmy said . " We do n't like strangers in our yard at night . " For some reason he had not said niggers . But then his another had brought him up never to say nigger to a nigger 's face .  | 13 It Jimmy Tallant Drives South A week later Jimmy Tallant was driving southwest toward Vicksburg and the River . The snow and freeze had staunched the spring : he drove through misting rain , swamps , and advertisements . The heater smelled . The windshield wipers kicked like a weary dance team . He played the radio until he could n't tell a cowboy song from the lady interview with the dress designer . He wished that Tinker was right there next to him , riding in front of the cigarette lighter . At Yazoo City , after many miles in the flatland , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along the highway now , nearing Jackson , there were many new houses . Some were regular government , FHA styles with the carport , the empty picture window open on the highway , and nothing inside the whole house , it would seem , but the " Gone-with-the-Wind " lamp right in the center of the window . Bella had bought a lamp like this and put it in the middle of her picture window . " It 's a real imitation colonial antique , " she had told him . Other houses were larger and swankier : imitation Southern colonial , imitation Georgian , " ranch type . " They had probably cost a filthy lot of money . For this was oil country now , and what was n't oil was cattle . All the front yards of the new houses were mushy and sparsely covered with grass . The trees in the yards stood hardly tall as a man and had been planted in pairs . He passed some places he liked to see , houses low-set and deep in porches , screens , and tacked-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of a house outward and hardly ever think about how a thing will look to themselves , much less to strangers going by in a car . Theirs was the opposite impulse from the picture window . Heavy trees belonged to them , bare pecan whose intricate branches collected a blue , wet intensity  | out of the cold , and disheveled old cedars . Chairs on the big front porches were propped face to the wall to get them out of the damp . He was glad for places like these . Yet actually he had no desire to know the people who owned them , any more than to know the people who lived in the new imitation houses . Less , in fact , because in the new ones he was liable to find somebody he had been in school with or known in the war , he was liable to be offered a drink . But nothing on earth lured him toward the old places . In Tinker he could have made peace with them . She got on well with country people and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the soup mixture , how long it took to hook a rug , and where an antique highboy came from . The talk would mute and fade and come again  --  old talk you did n't have to listen to any more because you know it by heart already . But Tinker was gone , his link was broken . He sometimes wished now that he had not relied on her so much , or left behind him the road that would take him to the front yard , the shaggy tree , the screened porch , and the big Sunday dinner . Yet left it he had , and he could not go back . The very thought of it bored him to death . He would rather be riding the leaky gray monotony of highway , listening to the windshield wiper and the cowboy song , pursuing his own illegal business . Beyond Jackson , before Vicksburg , he began to look for the station and cafe . He found it right where they said , an ordinary white frame building , trimmed in red , pitched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive . But the others were prompt . He had not entered the cafe before a black Cadillac rose over the hill from Vicksburg and slid into place beside his Ford . Its plushy wheels pressed the gravel tenderly , and its motor purred like a kitten . Three men got out and went with Jimmy into the cafe . They sat down at a table covered with a red checkered cloth which matched the curtains in the windows . The windows were sweated over from the gas radiance which had overheated the upper air of  | the room , though the cement floor , sweating also , was chill . The proprietor came in from the station and said he thought it was too hot in there . He turned the gas down and blew his nose . He had a bad cold . One of the men put a pint bottle of whisky on the table and asked for four glasses . He was chewing on a broomstraw . It seemed unlikely he had been near a broom on that or any other morning . " Hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shifted the straw with his tongue . The skin of his face was extremely thick and of a yellowish-brown color , the consistency and depth of discoloration often seen in sideshow barkers or men from the Southwest  --  it seems to come not so much from the sun as from exposure , and exposure not so much to weather as to every kind of strange affair and person and injury . He wore a dark wool shirt , a brilliant tie and a light gray hat of extraordinarily fine felt . When the glasses came he poured out a scant inch of whisky for himself and took it quickly , then drank a little water . He shoved the bottle toward the second man , who did the same . This one was dressed like the first , and looked a good bit like him , except that he had a squat face that seemed thoughtful but may only have been stupid . His hair was jet-black and very coarse , and grew in spikes out from the crown , each hair making its separate break for the open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked Indian , just as the burnt-faced man looked Mexican : but then you usually thought men like them were part something else . " Excuse me , " the second man said , and pushed the bottle on to Jimmy . " Hair of the dog , you know . " Jimmy shook his head and passed the whisky on to the third , who was young , just a boy , and who wore his coat very roomy . " I 'll jest wait till I get me a Coca-cola , " said the boy , and grinned . There was no doubt whatever where he was from . Jimmy Tallant was probably kin to him . So this was who they got to carry the gun for them . How important were they , then , or how important did they think they were , or hope they were ? " Yeah , the sheriff , " said Jimmy . " He took a notion to die . "  | " Just took a notion , huh ? " " Natural causes , " Jimmy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . " " Yeah , so what about this new fellow ? " " That 's a different thing , " said Jimmy . " What is he ? A Baptist ? A Jesus boy ? " " He 's a sheep dog , " Jimmy said . " He 's going to cross the Delaware if he has to swim through the light brigade . " The second man , the thoughtful one , woke up and looked suspicious . " I do n't get you , " he said . " He 's a football star , " Jimmy said . " He 's trying to make a touchdown . " The second man turned to the first . " If I do n't get it , how is Sam going to ? " The first man took the straw out of his mouth and winked at Jimmy . " That 's right . He was a football star . Won five hundred cold cash for me one time in the last thirty seconds of play . Against LSU in ' 39 . You remember the day ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the word I came to bring you is , he might be better in football than he is in politics . " " I understand you 've been shut down for two weeks . He must be doing all right . Ai n't that what they want up there , the Sundayschool class and the Epworth League ? Ai n't that what they vote for up in them hills ? Wallace here , he 's from up in them hills . Ai n't that the way they are , Wally ? " The boy in the loose coat grinned . " I ai n't from Winfield County . Winfield County , tha 's a crazy county . I would n't be from Winfield County for nothing . " The thoughtful man leaned forward . " How 'd he do it ? We heard you had a inside man  --  a deputy . " " I have , " Jimmy said . " He 's all right and he 's working . He tipped me off when they brought the National Guard up . They scoured the county and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks later he did by himself . Nobody knew it . He just  | drove out in a strange car with his hat pulled down to his nose and ordered a fifth from the carhop . When the boy brought it out , he had us cold . Slapped on the biggest fine in the books , confiscated ten cases of bonded whisky , and fixed it so we ca n't even sell beer for six weeks . " " One man walked in and did you that much damage ? What did he have with him , the atom bomb ? " " I ca n't hurt him , " Jimmy said . " It 's still my place , goddam it , you have n't moved your wheels and tables up there yet . I got my reasons and I stick to them . " " The thing we came to say is , we may not move the wheels and tables up there at all . So Sam says . " " Tell Sam , " Jimmy said , " that by September this man will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August . When there 's an election Harper goes . " " How do you know he will ? " " I 'm going to see to it , that 's how I know . " " You running yourself ? " " We 're running Travis 's deputy . And I 'm fixing it beforehand so he ca n't help but win . " " How ? How are you fixing it ? " " It 's my county and my neck of the woods . I know better how to handle it than anybody else . If you want to get somebody else up there ? " " That 's not it . Just tell us a little something . " " Something we can tell Sam . " " That 's right . Just a little something we can tell Sam . " " All right , " said Jimmy Tallant . " This joker , this Harper , not only wants to purify Highway 82 from one county line to the other ; he 's got principles drawn up about treating the niggers right . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constituency . He thinks he can do a quiet job along those lines without anybody much noticing how liberal he is . I intend to smoke him out . " " So then ? "  | " So then it takes care of itself . Ask the kid here . Nobody with one solitary idea on the Negro question has got a chance in the world of getting elected to public office in Winfield County . " " Tha 's right , " said the boy cheerfully . " They ai n't got a chance . Nor in Tippah County either . " " So everything 's under control , Mitchell , " said Jimmy . " You can tell Sam . " Mitchell sneezed . He went and stood by the gas radiance , and stared at the sweat-covered windows . " God , what a joint . You could n't pay me to live in Miss'ippi . " " There are plenty more just like it , " Jimmy said gloomily , " in Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana and Texas , Montana , Utah , Idaho and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the truth , " said Pilston , the Indian-looking one . " I wonder why Mitchell picked this one . " " I remembered it , " Mitchell said , " because they got a alligator out back . " " A alligator ! " the boy repeated . " That 's right . There used to be a sign up : ten cents to see the alligator . The sign 's gone , so I do n't reckon he 's still got the thing . " " Did you ever see it ? " " See it ? No . I never seen it . " " Maybe he never did have it , " said Pilston . " Why would he put a sign up about a alligator if he did n't even have one ? " the boy asked . The proprietor came in . " Hey , " said the boy , " have you got a alligator back in the back ? " " Sure , " said the proprietor ; " back in the back yard . Go on out and look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter . " The boy got up . " Sure enough ? Can I ? " " Sure . I 'll show you . " The other three men for a moment seemed about to follow the boy and the proprietor . There seemed to be something awful about not having in the room with them a person curious to see an alligator free of charge .  | Mitchell said , " They have them all out West , you know , these roadside zoos and things . They put up signs all along the way about what big Gila monsters and rattlesnakes they 've got . I remember one time I was driving out to Tia Juana with a young fellow something like the boy here and we stopped to get some gas and a hamburger at one of those zoo places . Was n't a soul around . Just a lot of yellow and red signs about what a hell of a fine place it was  --  I can see them yet . The kid went back to the zoo , but he could n't find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all starving and some of them were dead . They did n't have any water . It smelled to high heaven back there , he said . A Mexican came along and said the man that owned the place had died and the woman had hitch-hiked off and never did come back . So the kid could n't stand it . He went in and shot the snakes and the wild cats , and opened the other cages for the things to get out . That 's how come I remembered this place . Everytime I see anything like a zoo place , I think of that other time . This kid here , he had to see the alligator too . They 're all alike , kids like that . " " Wonder why they do n't charge to see him in the winter , " said the Indian-looking man . " Alligators get cold in the winter . They ai n't up to much , " said Mitchell after a time . The Indian-looking man thought it over , then said , " How the hell do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know . I 'm just guessing . It stands to reason , do n't it ? Do n't it , Tallant ? " " Sounds all right to me , " Jimmy said . " I bet he 's ' sleep right now , " said Mitchell . " Cold and sluggish and ' sleep . Lay you four bits on it . " " If this keeps up we 'll have to go back and look at the damned thing , " said the Indian-looking man . " No we wo n't , " said Mitchell . " We 'll just ask the kid . He 'll tell us . " " Okay then . We 'll ask the kid . " When the boy came back , Mitchell asked him , " How was the alligator ? Was n't he cold and sluggish ? "  | " Mighty sluggish , " the boy said , " and he looked cold . " " Was he asleep ? " the Indian-looking man asked . " He was when we came out , but then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking at us or not . " " See , so I do n't owe you nothing . He was n't asleep . " " He was asleep till they woke him up . " " No , we did n't wake him up . He woke himself up . Maybe he was n't asleep . " " See , you ca n't tell . I do n't owe you nothing . Not a dime . " They were still arguing when they got into the Cadillac. 14 ; : Errand by Night Beck Dozer would not tell his wife where he was going . " It 's best you do n't know . If something happens and they ast you , it 's best you can just say , He never said . " " Next time I going to marry me a field nigger , " said Lucy . " Somebody too tired at night to go out and get theyselves in trouble . " " Whar you goin ' , Unker Beck ? " asked W.B. " Blow your nose , " Beck Dozer told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed day . " He put on his town-cut coat , and English-type tweed jacket , ordered by measure from Sears Roebuck . In overalls he was apt to give the impression of being not exactly skinny but skimpy , as if there had been just enough material to make him . But in this coat , and especially when he shined his glasses on the sleeve and put them on , he brought to mind a college classroom and himself with a notebook , ready to walk in and lecture . He took a swallow of whisky from a pint bottle on the mantelpiece , then he went to a large mirror in a gilt frame and examined the knot in his tie , firming it . Just across the room in a matching gilt frame , hung an  | enormous daguerreotype of Beck 's father , Robinson Dozer . He had a thin face , large eyes , and wore a string tie . If Beck Dozer looked professorial , his father 's face brought gentlemen to mind , and a gentleman 's household , and how gentlemen liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whisky in and who drank it . Robinson Dozer had been one of the twelve Negroes shot down in the Lacey courthouse in 1919 . He had been the emissary to the blacks , the one who had said , You all come on in ; they wants to talk this thing over . Beck Dozer had been four years old when it happened : his father 's murder was his earliest recollection of childhood . " You ai n't going to wear your good coat out in this rain ? " his wife asked . " Lucy , " said Beck , " I gots to wear my good coat tonight . " Back in the kitchen where W.B. had gone there was a sudden lot of racket involving a tin bucket top , a pan that had been set under the leak , and a scuttle of kindling . Lucy went back and yelled at W.B. " What you thank you doing ? Jest tell me that ! " She returned with the baby on her arm , cleaning its face on her dress and hushing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go out in this , Beck , " Lucy said . " Hit 's way too bad a night . " Beck Dozer took the baby from her and set it on a pallet down before the fire . He caught her arm and pulled her after him through the door to the hall , then through the hall and front door to the porch . Lucy was thin as a railroad track , a real nigger gal in a straightcut cotton dress , with big bare feet , black greased hair , and a world of softness on the bone . In the big room , through the open doorways , the raining sounds talked loudly . W.B. forgot about his troubles in the kitchen . He ran into the hall and back , then leaned over the arm of the rocking chair by the fire where a pile of petticoats and skirts and an apron lay like an old soft quilt . " Granny , " he said . " Unker Beck hugging Aunt Lucy . Out on the poach . I seen hit and I knows hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand like a daddy longleg 's foot came out and groped for him . " He 's Granny 's Jesus chile , " said the old woman . " He 's Granny 's man . " " I'se a little bitty ole black nigger , " said W.B. , and got the silly giggles . Beck Dozer heard this as he left , and had the impulse to go back and tell W.B. that he was in reality half British . Nobody could have told him except Beck Dozer , nor that Beck was not his uncle but his father . As he double-buttoned his slicker high at the throat and went down the steps into the rain , he wondered now if anybody would ever know . It made him sad to think about W.B. , never knowing whose he was , and sad to think of the plain little English girl who would n't leave a Negro Yank alone , and sad to think of himself who no matter what he argued or said had always wanted a white woman . He thought of his father too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle face , and he thought that dying should not be a public thing . He saw that everything most clear to him was sorrowful , full of Negro sorrow . He included himself in his sorrows , for he always suspected that , like his father , he was going out to deal with white people someday and never come home again . Some hours later , both his hands were bleeding and he was standing on the hill outside a white man 's house . The hill was narrow at the flank , scarcely large enough , it appeared , for the house to rest on it , so that where Beck Dozer stood at an angle back from the lighted windows he had to watch out that he did n't fall off in the gully , down amongst all the vines and varmints . The room he could see into was a bedroom , a children 's room , with an iron white-painted single bed and a crib . A young white woman with dark hair was moving about , putting two children to bed . The older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was white as his skin , turned over the wastebasket meddling in it and got blessed out for it . Beck Dozer circled the house and gained the back door .  | 15 Beck 's Legal Right Tinker kept insisting she heard something until she went to the back door to see for herself , and there stood a Negro out by the steps in the rain . " Duncan , " she called . " Duncan ! There 's somebody here to see you . " Her husband was beside her quickly , leaning out . The Negro had not knocked , but had stood saying , " Mister Harper ? Mister Harper ? " over and over , and now that they saw him it seemed they had heard him for certain all the time , for no telling how long , for it is part of the consciousness of a Southern household that a Negro is calling at the back door in the night . " It 's Dozer , is n't it ? " Duncan asked , shielding his brow and squinting against the rain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the wet . " Duncan held the door for him . He raked the mud from his shoes on a steel mat . " Watch out for the floor , " said Tinker . " A little mud , " said Duncan . " Not mud ; he 's bleeding . Do n't you see his hands ? " " Good Lord , what have you got yourself into ? " " I got in a fight . That 's how come I 'm here . " " You wait right there while I get a towel , " Tinker said . " Do n't they need to be bandaged , Duncan ? " " Looks like it , " he called after her . " Do you need a doctor , Beck ? Are you hurt anywhere else ? " " Just my hands , " said Beck Dozer . In the kitchen , Tinker made him wash in a basin she kept put aside for the children when they hurt themselves , then dabble on some medicine while she cut strips of gauze and adhesive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the curiously  | jagged cuts and scratches , " you got mixed up with some woman owned a crosscut saw . Who 've you been scrapping with ? " " Bud Grantham was who it was , " said Beck Dozer . " I went out there to buy some whisky . " " He ca n't sell you any . I shut him down . " " That 's what you think . It 's going out the back door to anybody comes along . He sold some to a white man just before me ? I seen him leaving with it in a newspaper  --  then he said he did n't have none for me . I said , I gots the cash money , and it 's just as good money as that one just now bought a fifth from you , Mr. Grantham . He spit and says , It 's nigger money ; do n't fool yourself , nigger , it ai n't never good as white money and it ai n't never going to be . He threw in a word or two I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a GI word or two back and he hit at me , but I ducked him and hit back . " " You hit Bud Grantham ! " Tinker exclaimed . The idea of this Negro hitting anybody was more than you could have expected of him , as if a soggy , thin little firecracker , long after the explosion of the pack , had taken a notion to go off . But she saw his face and did not laugh . Beck Dozer blinked behind his glasses . " I had a razor , " he announced . Duncan whistled . " He picked up a butcher knife he had there with him opening a crate of whisky and came at me with it . He started yelling for Jimmy Tallant . That 's when he hacked into my hands  --  they was up like this to save my face from him . So I outs with my razor and gave him the quickest cut I could " ? he made a nasty motion with his bandaged right hand ? " and ran . " " Where 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The hand moved to the side of his neck , below the ear . " But you know you ca n't tell when a razor goes in and when it do n't . It 's so fine and sharp and slices so smooth ? " " That 'll do , " said Duncan sharply , as Tinker shuddered .  | " As I say , I aimed there . " " Yes . " " But I missed . " " That 's good , " said Duncan dryly . " I got him on the shoulder instead , right between the arm and the collar bone . I heard his shirt when the cloth split , but about the flesh , like I was saying ? " " Then you might have hurt him pretty bad ? " " I might have grazed him , sure enough , " said Beck Dozer , studious behind the milky shield of his glasses . " On the other hand , I might have missed him completely . " " Umm , " said Duncan . " Bad . Either way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away in the woods . " Tinker stepped back . Beck Dozer looked down at the snowy bandages and nodded to her . " I thank you , Mrs. Harper . But whatever I done " ? he turned back to Duncan ? " is done . And whatever it was , a Grantham wo n't forget it . " He moved to sit by the stove , the way Negroes coming into the white kitchens always did in the old days when the stove burnt wood and dried them while they smoked like bread , and warmed them , too , clean through to the bone . " If I no more than nicked Bud Grantham , if I no more than fanned the air in front of him , it 's enough for him and all them other Granthams to want my black hide . I 'm scared , Mister Harper . I came to ask you for custody . " " It might have been better , seeing that it 's Granthams we 're dealing with , if you had left town instead of coming to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Beck Dozer . " Getting out of town never solved anything . If a Negro never takes advantage of what legal rights are open to him , he ca n't hope to enjoy those that ought to be open and ai n't . You are the law , Mister Harper . I have come to you . " " That 's all very good reasoning , " said Duncan , " until a Negro picks the toughest white man in Winfield County for fancy razor  | work . If you 're so damned philosophic about this , you should have done about two seconds of thinking beforehand . " " But I did n't , " said Beck Dozer . " It looks that way , " said Duncan . He went to telephone the Idle Hour , Grantham 's house , and Jimmy Tallant 's , but received no answer to any , whereupon he called the Woolbrights ' and discovered that Kerney had taken Cissy Hunt to the picture show in Stark . He reentered the kitchen carrying his hat , his GI slicker slung over his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't agree with me , " inquired Beck Dozer , " that a Negro must use the law in good faith wheresoever and whensoever the opportunity arises ? " " Except for all the soevers , you might be quoting me , " said Duncan . " Okay then . We 'll go to jail . " " Jail ? " said Tinker at once . " I may be late , " Duncan told her . " I 'll try to call you . Lock the house up good . If Kerney calls in , tell him to come up to the jail . " She had been scalding the basin at the sink . Now she went anxiously to him . " Jail ? " Duncan smiled . " He asked for custody , darling . That 's what custody means . I have to put him in jail to keep him safe from the Granthams . " " It 's my legal right , " Beck Dozer explained to her kindly . " I 'm sorry you 're mixed up in any of this , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back door , she leaned out , calling after them , " Duncan , look for Jimmy . " He turned at the car door . " For Tallant ? " " Yes , he  --  he 'll know . " The rain rustled between them . " You 're right . He will . " The car door closed .  | 16 The Jailer Upstairs , the jail was so black you could not even see the iron bars . From below , Mr. Trewolla , the jailer , at last found the switch ; a bulb that hung from a dusty cord shed a thin light about them . All the cells stood empty with the cold , sweaty black iron doors slightly ajar , and when the big door that closed the stair ceased to send forty kinds of echoes walking amongst the shadows , you could hear the coal dust near the stove smashing unpleasantly beneath their damp shoes . But this was an ordinary sound , better than the big door . At the touch of the key , at the pull of the hinges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice stirred ; a little more and it might have formed a word  --  the very one you never wanted to hear . The only person in jail was a Negro woman named Lu , sitting over in the corner on a broken chair . " Oh , Jesus , Brer Beck , " she said , " I never thoughts to see you here . " " What you doing in here ? " he asked her . " I had to eat , " she said . " Anybody ought to eat . How you do , Mister Harper ! " Duncan remembered her well . She was a slump-shouldered Negress who wrapped her head in a rag and carried her chin low and to one side , angling a sour eye at the world . Tinker had hired her , being unable to get anyone else , right after their second child was born . She did not steal or tote , but was of a complaining nature . She had nothing , she said ; her children had nothing ; they had to go to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her and should have furnished her a little from the old age , but they could n't get the old age because they had the law title to that old pieced-together house that all of them lived in ; and her husband should have helped her at least to raise  | the lawyer 's fee to transfer the title of the house so her mama and papa could be legally penniless and get the old age , but her husband took up with a yellow . About this point of hearing the story for the fifth time , Tinker raised up suddenly in bed and told her , " There 's a ten-dollar bill on the mantelpiece . Take it and buy those children some shoes and do n't you ever come in this house again . " " The cawn bread ai n't done , " said Lu . " Then it 'll just have to burn up , " said Tinker . Lu thought . " You firing me ? " " I certainly am , " said Tinker . " O000 ! " said Lu , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief next , " Lu told her , " I has to say how come . " " You can say you talk too much , " said Tinker , and fell back , exhausted . Lu thought again . " Does I ? " she asked . " Your sister has got food , " said Beck Dozer to Lu . " To my personal knowledge . " " You need n't think she 's going to give me none , " said Lu . " What you done done to your han 's ? " " Why wo n't she give you none ? " " She too stingy . Me and her 's twins and she was bawn sucking on both tits . " " You 're not going to want to stay up here long , " Duncan told him , " unless you can find some way to hush her . " He went downstairs . Mr. Trewolla was an old man with liver spots on his hands and a hernia which he thought about tenderly , all the time . He had been the jailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sheriff . He took a dim view of all sheriffs and town marshals . A deacon in the Baptist Church , he had considered Travis a loose character , and had felt comfortably backed up by God when Travis died . He thought of Duncan as a boy who had a lot to learn , but since he understood around town that Duncan would " take a drink , " and that his wife " took a drink " with him , he felt  | the chances of his learning anything were small indeed . Mr. Trewolla honestly believed that anybody who would " take a drink " would do " most anything . " Nobody could tell him : every Saturday night he saw plenty of the kind of thing whisky could do . He held complicated opinions on every arrest , but these opinions , like tortuous country roads that all led to the same dreary hamlet , invariably ended : " Whisky , you know . Whisky . " Mrs. Trewolla , his big fat wife , cooked turnip greens and sowbelly for the prisoners every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bath and powdered , she would go uptown in the afternoons , walking around visiting , telling everybody exactly the things Mr. Trewolla had already said . " Daddy says , " she would begin , then she would quote , all the way through , " Whisky , you know . Whisky . Just like Daddy says . " She did not have the imagination to alter anything . Duncan stood in the hall of the jail and looked through into the living room where a hooded metal lamp was burning beside the armchair . Mr. Trewolla , in his green eyeshade , had gone back to reading the newspaper . Behind him the high old-fashioned windows rattled in their frames when the wind sluiced the rain against them . Duncan had recently read about a man at the university who had made a study of jails and had come up with the information that only five jails in the state of Mississippi took an unskilled person of average intelligence more than twenty minutes to break into or out of . He did not think that the Lacey jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trewolla 's duties to make a yearly report on the condition of the jail . Mr. Trewolla had done this faithfully every year , but every year had always said the same thing  --  that the jail was sound as ever . Duncan entered the living room and laid Mr. Trewolla 's keys on the table . " Have a seat , have a seat , " said Mr. Trewolla . He laid aside his newspaper . Duncan felt too rushed to sit down , but he did it anyway . " Looks bad in Korea , " said Mr. Trewolla.  | " Yes , sir , it does . I 'd hate to be fighting in all that mud and ice . " " They ought to have done what MacArthur told them . It 's enough to make you sick . That fool Truman . Trying to tell the finest general of our time how to fight a war . Trying to tell us down here in Miss'ippi what we got to do for niggers . " " He 's got his faults , " said Duncan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can ask Mrs. Trewolla what I 've said about him from the beginning . Ha ! " " Mr. Henry , about this boy upstairs ? " " Drunk ? " " No , sir , I want to tell you . There may just possibly be trouble . He says he 's been in a scrap with Bud Grantham . He came to me for custody . Grantham and Tallant would bend heaven and earth to give me trouble . They may come for him ? you ca n't tell . " " What was he doing at Grantham 's ? " " Trying to buy some whisky . " " Then it 's dog eat dog , " said Mr. Trewolla . " The best thing you could do was let Grantham handle him . They 've got their ways , those fellows . They deal with rough cases all the time . " " He asked us for nothing but his right . That is , if he 's telling the truth . We 're going to give it to him , even if they try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prove they 're still selling whisky , I can throw the book at them . " " You can what ? " " I can ruin them . Confiscate everything . " " Nothing is going to stop them , in my opinion , " said Mr. Trewolla . " Do n't think you 've cramped their style . There 's just as much going out the back door as ever went out the front . I been knowing that . Said it at the time . " " Mr. Henry , the only thing I want you to do is keep that nigger safe . " Mr. Trewolla 's nervous old man 's hand with the yellowed nails  | fumbled with his eyeshade . He scratched his forehead where the mark of the shade showed red across his indoor skin . " You 'll never get a conviction . You going to carry a nigger 's evidence in front of a grand jury ? " Duncan rose . " I 'm trying to carry out one step at a time what the law says is the right thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of a law against the law , did you ? " Mr. Trewolla followed him to the front door . " And what 's that nigger trying to do ? Commit suicide ? " " I do n't claim to understand it all so far , Mr. Henry , but I hope to before the night 's over . Let 's just keep him safe and do n't let anybody in unless they 've come from me . Do n't you think that might be best ? " " If that 's your orders , why then ? " " I 'd think it might be better for Miss Annie to go over somewhere else . " " I 'm staying right here with Daddy , " said Mrs. Trewolla at once from the other side of the kitchen door . " Whatever you think . Goodnight then , Mr. Henry , and thank you . Goodnight , Miss Annie . " " Goodnight , boy . " " You heard it aIl , " said Mr. Trewolla to his wife the minute the door closed ; " what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of it , Daddy ? " " There 's something funny about it . " " That 's exactly what I said , Daddy . There 's something funny about it . " " You remember Duncan 's uncle , old Philip Harper . He was a Hoover man . The only vote cast for Hoover in Lacey and Winfield County in 1932 was Philip Harper 's . " " But Duncan is sweet , " said Mrs. Trewolla suddenly , with fat conviction . " He sat down and talked to you . He thought about me staying here . You know that was sweet , Daddy . " " I 'm telling you right now , " said Mr. Trewolla , who was far  | more alarmed by an opinion from his wife than by anything Duncan had done , " there 's funny politics mixed up in this . You 'll see . I never thought I 'd wish for Travis Brevard back in office . I know what whisky is , but funny politics ? ! " He shook his head , readjusted his eyeshade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the newspaper . 17 A Call to Kerney Duncan felt the need of Kerney so much that he telephoned the movie house in Clark from the pay station in the drugstore and had him paged . " There 's a nigger in the woodpile , " Duncan concluded , " in addition to the one in the jail . I think Tallant is back of it . " " Then there 's a hook in it somewhere , " said Kerney , " at the very least . " " I ca n't get anybody I can depend on , " said Duncan . " Trewolla is set in his ways and thinks I 'm still in knee britches , and Follansbee is off God knows where , though I certainly do n't want him . " " You can deputize , you know . " " But it makes me look a fool to deputize over nothing . " " Then what are you planning to do ? " " Go look for Tallant and Grantham first , and try to get the straight of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused . " Then I 'll go sit in the jail with the nigger , I guess . What 's the matter , Kerney ? " " Nothing ; I was laughing . Ca n't you lock him in the jail and leave him there ? " " The jail is nothing , " said Duncan . " You could break into it with a can opener . " " Look , " said Kerney , " I 'll take Cissy home now and come up  | and check with you . Maybe we can figure something out . Duncan ? " " What ? " " It 's raining too hard to lynch a nigger . It 's too cold . " " It 's what ? " " It 's the wrong time of year , too . These things are supposed to happen in the middle of September after it has n't rained for forty weeks , after all the cattle have died of thirst and their stench rolls in from the country and there 's so much dust the sun looks bloody all day long . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Duncan . " I never saw a lynching . " " I never did either , " said Kerney . " All I know is what I read in William Faulkner . Duncan ? " " Yeah ? " " I just thought . I never heard of a Negro that would make a farce out of a lynching , let alone his own . " " You never met Beck Dozer , " said Duncan . " No , I never did . See you later , Duncan . " " See you later . " 18 The Squaring Off In Jimmy Tallant 's house on the highway a little light burned through the rain ; it seemed a friendly sight in an otherwise doleful , chill , muddy , self-centered world . Inside , in the bedroom , Jimmy Tallant 's wife Bella was sitting on the arm of the easy chair with a magnifying mirror in her hand , pulling out her eyebrows . Jimmy stood in the door watching her for a while , wondering why she was doing it , until he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What are you trying to do , get rid of all of them ? " " It said in this magazine article , " Bella explained , in her care not looking up , " that I 'm the age to do it this way . "  | " What age is that , and what way do they mean ? " " Well , they said that back in the 1930 'S Marleen Deetritch and Jean Harlow used to know how to make their faces look more sophisticated by refining the line of their eyebrows , but that women finally revolted from that fashion and went in for the natural look . They said that was still all right for young girls up to when they got around twenty-five , but after that that a woman owed it to her maturity and poise to use every device to give herself more sophistication ? " " Yes , but Bella , are you absolutely sure that when you get through there you are going to have a sophisticated look ? " She put down the glass and thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't ever change at all . " " You best stop that kind of changing before you start it . Turn around and look at me . Lord , Bella , you 're going to scare the doctors when you go to the hospital . " " I ai n't done yet , " she said , and picked up the mirror sadly . " I read another article . It was written by a doctor , an M.D. , only he 's a famous psychiatrist too ; I forget his name . Anyway , it said that at this particular point when you 're pregnant , husbands ought to be especially considerate and thoughtful . This doctor said that in his personal opinion husbands were personally responsible for one-third of all miscarriages , and that all that the husbands caused were pure and simple psychological cases . That 's what it 's called : The Psychological Miscarriage . I saved it out for you to read . It 's over there on the dresser . " " God , " said Jimmy , " if everything 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had you thought about that ? " " There is such a thing , " she said earnestly , " as a psychological pregnancy . I know because Elsie Mae Henderson had one , re-member ? " " Just so you did n't read it in another article , " he said . " I have n't got anything to do but read articles , " she said ; " that and True Detective . Just waiting for my time to come . "  | " You might try washing the dishes . I bet you have n't touched them . " " You never did send me the nigger , " she said . " I tell you every goddamned time it comes up . I ca n't get the nigger since the joint shut down . " " You could go and get the nigger ! " she shouted at him , and began to cry . " You 've got so damned important since you 're really going to have that baby there 's not any staying in the same house with you . I never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems like you 've been pregnant for at least a year . You better not give me one of those psychological run-arounds , miscarriage or otherwise . I 'll have this marriage declared so null and void I 'll not only swear you 're a virgin , I 'll even believe it . The kitchen is full of coffee grounds and rotten orange peels . There 's bacon grease all over the sink and a whole raw egg busted in one stove eye . The living room is full of dirty glasses from three nights ago , and there 's a washtubful of cigarette ashes turned upside down in the middle of the rug . " " My back hurts me all the time , " she said . " It hurts me so bad sometime I think I 'll just die . And I 'm all time wanting to wee and then I ca n't . " He advanced on her . " I 'm not going to live in filth . I hate it . There are women who keep their houses straight with pains in the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two or three children to cook for three times a day , seven days a week . You do n't have much to do . So for God 's sake , do it ! " He took a swat at her , but whether he intended it to land was not clear to either of them , because she began to giggle as though it were a romp and caught his hand , dropping the mirror which broke on the floor . It was a ten-cents-store mirror , the kind that magnifies on one side . She spent many hours a day with it , doing minute things to her face . " Stop , stop . Stop , silly . There 's somebody at the door ! Do n't you hear them ? Somebody at the front door . "  | He did hear . He let go her arm , which she began to nurse . He stared at the broken pieces of mirror for an instant . " Seven more years ' bad luck . Well , clean it up . " He shut the bedroom door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorstep stood Duncan Harper , his slicker gleaming with rain . " I 've been trying to call you , " he said . " Your phone out of order ? " " Not that I know of . Come in . " " I 'm looking for Bud Grantham , " Duncan said . " You have n't seen him ? " " As a matter of fact , I have , " said Jimmy Tallant . " He ca n't see anybody , now or later . He had an accident tonight . " " It might have been a fight he had , " Duncan said . " It might have been . " There sounded a wail from the next room . " My daddy 's hurt and you never told me ! " The door clattered open  --  the damp had swelled the wood , so that it stuck on the jamb . " Get on back to bed , honey , " said Jimmy . " You know you ought n't to be up . It 's nothing serious or I would 've told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , wrapper drooping about her shoulders , eyebrows mismatched , and in all her pregnancy so honestly uncomfortable that Duncan felt sorry for her . " Good evening , Bella , " he said . She looked just like one of her cousins who used to sit in front of him in one grade and comb her hair over and over with a pink comb . She had the bobby pins all piled up before her open book and a little mirror propped in the pencil rack , and when the teacher asked her a question all she heard was her name and all she said was , " I do n't know . " " Hello , Duncan . " She looked around the living room . In truth , an oversized ash tray lay upside down in the middle of the carpet , and ash had tracked away from it on either side . " Is n't everything a mess ? " she said . " I know how it is , " Duncan reassured her . But even as he  | spoke he could hear in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the minute of going to the hospital , putting clean things into orderly dresser drawers . " Sure , " said Jimmy . " He knows how it is . " " No , he does n't , " she said quietly , and closed the door between them . " Come on back here where she wo n't hear us , " Jimmy said , and led him into what Bella called the " dinette , " where he lighted a large gas radiance . They stood near it , warming . The rain beat a steady drum . They found it awkward to be alone together . " Well , sheriff ? " " I want to see Bud Grantham . " " All right . I 'll tell you what you do . You follow the old Wiltshire road for ten miles till you get right this side of Black Hawk , then you take off up a hill without any gravel . There 's a bob-wire gap about a half a mile on , that 's how you 'll know you got the right road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch . After that it 's only two more miles to where Bud 's gone to . " " He could n't have got back there in this rain . Nobody could . " " His brother came for him . You see , Granthams are like that , Duncan . Every time one of them gets sick , they figure they 're going to die , and they got to die on the old homestead or they wo n't go to heaven . So Bud heads home if he has to swim the branch with galloping double pneumonia . " The gas heated quickly . In the living room Jimmy drew out chairs for them both and offered Duncan a cigarette . " How about a drink ? " " No thanks . " " If you want to go back there , Duncan , you 'll have to go without me . I tried to get him to stay here ? " " He must have had a doctor ; that is , if he 's so bad off he went home to die . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't hold with doctors . Bud 's a herb man . He 's got an aunt who stirs all  | this stuff up in pots on a stove out in a little outhouse about the size of a pantry . She doctors every Grantham in the county ? no , Duncan , it 's true . You have n't been out in those woods , I bet , since all of us used to rabbit-hunt . You have n't kept up your connections . How should you know ? " " You are n't convincing me of much , " said Duncan . " I 've got my doubts that Grantham is so much as scratched . Still , there 's a nigger come to me for custody . I 've put him in jail and now I 'm answerable for him . " " There 's no answerable to it . A nigger that jumps a Grantham is answerable to the other Granthams . That means me . " " Then you 'll have to deal with me first . There are two types of mess I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic is one , and nigger trouble is the other . " " It 's widely known , " said Jimmy Tallant , " how you feel . " At the scorn in his tone , Duncan rose impulsively . " You 've got no right to play with important things like these . They reach out to be bigger than us or Winfield County . Bootlegging is n't like having a still out in the back pasture any more . It pulls a lot of wires all over the country . I 've heard that you 're going to put gambling in , that a New Orleans syndicate is backing you . What are you trying to make out of Winfield County ? You 're big-talking now about lynching a Negro . Maybe you do n't mean any real harm to him , but suppose the thing gets out of hand ? There 's a national press that stands ready to jump on all such as this , and they never get the straight of things . They make us all sound like a bunch of barefoot morons who love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what you 'd call a public-spirited citizen , for a fact , " said Jimmy . " I care about as much about the national press and the nigger organizations as they care about me and the niggers . And that , as you know , is exactly nothing . " " At least you could care about your own people . " Jimmy narrowed the lids of his foxy eyes . " I 've appreciated  | your hospitality from time to time . I 've taken right much pleasure from your drinking-whisky . " " We 've always been glad to have you . Tinker 's devoted to you , Jimmy . " " In your place I would n't have stood for it , " Jimmy said . " Now you 're after saying I do n't care much about her . If that 's what you mean ? " " I even named her , " Jimmy went on . " Her name was Louise . Louise Taylor . I started calling her Tinker because she was counting off some buttons on her dress one day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let her get any farther . Every time I would say , Who ? Who 's Tinker Taylor ? till she got mad at me and cried . She was a true old compass , Tinker was , and every time I took her out and looked at her , the needle pointed north . Every time I said , Who do you love ? she said Duncan . " He rose and went to the window . " It 's true things never worked out for us the way we thought they would , " Duncan said earnestly . " But what 's done is done . I do n't think our private lives should have anything to do with the nigger in the jail , or the bootlegging business , or the sheriff 's race . I think you 've got to face public things in another frame of mind . " " My father did a public thing , " said Jimmy Tallant . " He shot Robinson Dozer , among others , and that 's Dozer 's son that 's sitting in the jailhouse . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had been looking out the window while he spoke  --  Bella 's picture window she 'd had to have , to be like everybody else ; the imitation colonial antique Gone-with-the-Wind lamp was not lighted . So when he said what he did about his father and turned away from the rainy dark toward Duncan , who stood near the mantelpiece , he looked out of certain long shadows and seemed a greater distance away than he actually was . His face , so sharp when the mind sped , held now a touch of the hound 's sadness , but above all it was a lonely face , pulled in like the rain off the  | wild stretches . He made you think of telephone poles leaning infinitely on along a highway that went forever toward the mountains . You could no more talk to him than you could talk to a song . " I hate to say this , " said Duncan , going toward the door , " but until this election is over and I 've won , or you 've found some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best be dropping by the house again . " Jimmy Tallant did not answer him or protest . He did not bat an eye . It seemed that his face darkened slightly , as though dark had come strongly between them through the front door when Duncan opened it . " I might drop by the jail and get that nigger , " he said . " I 'll be ready for you , " said Duncan . 19 It The Vigil " You gots a long time to wait , " said Beck Dozer . " It 's not but ten o'clock . " " If it 's much later maybe they 'll be too sleepy or too drunk , " Duncan said . " But in the earlier hours , or so I have read , they still have got their daylight minds . It takes the midnight mind to do the black deed to the black man . " " Oh , Jesus , " said Lu . " Do n't make it sound so true , Brer Beck . " Duncan laughed . " All you niggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying Oh Jesus do n't make it sound so true , every time you paused to mop your brow . You could preach them in and out of hell all day long , stop long enough to go outdoors and eat fried chicken , and take a different one home every night . " " And you think that would be the end , " said Beck Dozer , " of the so-called Negro question . " " They call it bread and circuses , " said Duncan .  | " Why , so they do , " said Beck . " This is the first time I done ever darkened a jail door , " said Lu . " And now look . " The two men were seated in cane-bottom chairs on either side of the cold stove . The Negro woman had retreated into the corner of the nearest cell and had begged Duncan until he had locked her in . She wanted to make sure that an iron door stood between her and whoever might arrive . Duncan had tried to make her go home as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S'pose I meets ' m on the stairs ? " she had asked . " But you ca n't now , " said Duncan . " Why ca n't I ? " " Because they are n't there . " " S'pose I meets ' m at the do ' ? " " But nobody 's outside . Look out there ; it 's empty . " " S'pose I meets ' m on the road ? " " You can see the road , too , in the streetlight . You can see nearly all the way around the courthouse . Nobody 's there . " " But when I gets to the turning of the road , what if I meets ' m there ? " Duncan had not answered . It would be just Lu 's luck to meet a pack of drunk Granthams , sure enough , and get hurt by mistake . " With they bob-wire whups , " Lu went on , " and they fat pine kindling wood . With they coal oil and they blow torches ? " " Hush up , woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , it 's me , and anyway I understand that kind of thing is out of date . I hope somebody has told them so . " He sat angled a bit forward in the stiff little chair , keeping his weight off the corner where the cane had worn through . He had placed his hands one on either knee and the white bandages showed annoyingly clear in the dim light . He said to Duncan , " Why do n't you go downstairs with Mister Trewolla ? " " Mister Trewolla 's bedtime is nine o'clock . I let on I was just  | coming up to check on you , then going along home myself . " " You do n't want Mister Trewolla to think you 're casting aspersions on him , in other words . " " No more than I can help , " said Duncan . Lu had found an empty cigarette package in the corner , had spread it out carefully and was dismembering it , piece at a time , with her long picky fingers . You could hear the cellophane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the printed paper , then the tinfoil . " I wonder where is Mister Kerney Woolbright , " Beck Dozer asked . Duncan did not answer . He got up , took a restless turn back past the cell doors , looked up the narrow circular stair that led up to the death cell , the cupola of the jail . " There ai n't a soul up here to help you , " said Beck . " In past time , or so I hear , white folks could raise a number just like each other to stick together on these things , but you ca n't even find one honest deputy . Either you is the only man around with principles , or everybody else is stitching their principles together out of a different bolt of goods . " " It so happens I 'm the only man that 's sheriff , " said Duncan , " and that I have n't tried to deputize . Now shut up . If there 's anything worse than Lu talking every minute , it 's you talking every minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jailyard , the streetlight glow of the hollow square , his own grocery an obscure ridge in the store line along the farther side . He was wondering himself what had happened to Kerney Woolbright. 20 ; f : The Attack It was twelve midnight , as Beck Dozer had predicted , before they came . From the windows Beck and Duncan watched them get out  | of the car , which had arrived stodgily , slushing through the puddles . They piled out endlessly , like the old clown act at the circus , and milled about , turning their big shoulders to the rain 's slant and swapping a word or two until a familiar figure came up wirily from behind the ignition and led them through the gate . By count there were only seven . Lu began to wail , like something way off in the woods before dawn on a clear spring night . The sound , mounting , became less mysterious and more like Lu . " Shut that up , " Duncan said . " I ca n't hear anything that 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beck crossed quickly to Lu 's cell and stuck his face halfway through the bars . He spoke roughly . " It 's that kind of noise they wants out of a nigger . It 's what they 're waiting for you to do . It makes them feel good when you sound like that . It tells them they got you where they want you for another fifty , hundred , two hundred years . I says to shut up because I personally ca n't stand to listen to it , Lu Johnson . Nobody studying you . You think Jesus done forgot you ? " " Jesus , " said Lu , and hushed suddenly . " He ai n't never forgot me yet , Brer Beck . " " Then set there and think about Him till I tells you you can quit . " In the quiet , voices rose to them from the hall below , brushing now and again a tender spot in the iron . Mr. Trewolla was at the door in his bathrobe , trying to explain things without his teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He'th told me not to let you in . " " I just want to talk to him , " said Jimmy Tallant . " Do n't you let him through that door , " Duncan called out from above . " I 've talked to him once tonight already . If he wants to talk again , I 'll come downstairs . " " You thee ? " said Mr. Trewolla.  | " Some things have come to light since I saw Duncan . Grantham 's willing to settle the whole thing with no harm done to anybody . I have to see the nigger too . Five minutes will settle it . Okay ? " Mr. Trewolla sneezed . " Okay , " said Jimmy Tallant . A large young Grantham boy beside him laid a shoulder to the door which Mr. Trewolla had cracked open to talk . The screws that held the chain-bolt locks fixed in the old wood wrenched free , splintering . " You better go put some socks on , Mr. Henry , " Jimmy Tallant advised , as he stepped inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially this kind of weather . " " Duncan ! " Mr. Trewolla called toward the ceiling . " In thpite of everything I could do ? ! " " That 's okay , Mr. Henry , " Duncan answered , this time from behind the iron door at the head of the stair . " Just get on back in the back . " " You come back here to me , Daddy , " Mrs. Trewolla called . " You leave those awful people alone . " " It 's dog eat dog , " said Mr. Trewolla , going to obey Mrs. Trewolla . " Nothing in the world but likker-heads . If I 'd had my gun , now , but whisky'th , whisky , just like I always say . " " It 's a mighty brave man , " said Jimmy , " would come to meet six Granthams without even a beebee gun . Not to mention a Tallant . " The Granthams stood politely about in the hall like Granthams invited to a party in a stiff house . One said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door without no gun . But he sho ' did do it . He did n't have no gun at all . None I seen anyway . " " Turn that light out , " Duncan said rapidly to Beck . " Here 's the key . That little winding stair there leads up to the death cell . They ca n't shoot at you there . Lock yourself in good . " He checked his automatic , and took his stand behind the door .  | The bottom two-thirds of the door was solid iron , plated and bolted like the sides of a battleship , but the upper third was barred . Through the bars , looking down the stairs , which from the first landing upward narrowed to the width of a ladder , he saw Jimmy 's face surface toward him , pale against the dull iron gloss around about , and with that same distance in it he had noticed before , so that , rising steadily toward him , its distance increased  --  just as a star falling seems to be palpably near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as a car hurtling out of a highway gains a point in the glittering light where it seems to still and then reverse , or as a dying face still retreats the closer down you bend to hear the words and stay the breath , or as a man turns from a rainy window to say , " My father did a public thing . " Then Beck switched out the light . Granthams came up the stairs , banging and clattering , and by the time the noise died Duncan could make out Jimmy 's features again , now nearer than ever in the dark . Down near the bottom two Granthams were talking to each other . They used to be just that way , Duncan recalled , when he went to school with them . They were always five grades behind and had never been known to finish out a school year , because they came to school only when cotton picking was done and before spring plowing started , always provided the hunting season was poor . So when the teacher lined the classes up after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even try to quiet the Granthams . They were at the end of the line shoving each other , marveling at the size of their own great big fists , bigger already than most men 's on the town square ever got to be , and the misery and terror of anything not Grantham or Grantham kin that crossed their path was the misery and terror of the Pygmy who got in the giant village by mistake and walked down the street apologizing all the way . A Grantham by himself could be docile , and sometimes discovered sweetness and grew so good it would seem his own goodness was the only thing that amused him . So Granthams who got separated from other Granthams during the war came back from  | the Army sometimes leading fine girls who looked proud to be their wives , and so they moved into town or into other towns , and so the tribe had thinned . But Granthams together were another matter . Somebody had wronged them once  --  perhaps a British king had gone too far . Whatever it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a king ; they were better than a nigger . Nobody ought to forget it . The proud " high-white " servant made them spit . Granthams left living back in the woods now had few friends except each other ; yet a man like Jimmy Tallant , who had shown those foreigners over there how to fight a war , had known who he wanted to be home with when they got through pinning the ribbons on him . Duncan recalled , too , that the day he had entered Camp Shelby , in the same bunch with himself was a boy who happened to fall in beside him after the sergeant had dismissed them . " I think I 'll go back to town , " said the boy . " Town ! " Duncan said . " Did n't you hear what he just said ? We ca n't go outside camp for two days . " " Yeah , well I just thought I 'd go in for a little while . I thought you might want to come . " Duncan stared , then laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is the Army ? You have to take orders . " The boy was mild , but there was flint in him . He regarded Duncan and a mild spark fell . " You do n't want to go , I 'll go ahead on by m'self , " he said , and walked away . They had considerable trouble with him before he would make up his bed the way they had in mind , or keep his effects the way the diagram wanted . It was n't that he did n't understand them . Jimmy Tallant said , " Y'all boys shut up down there . " " Y'all hush , " the Granthams said to one another . " I should have picked up the keys from Trewolla , " said Jimmy . " He has n't got them , " said Duncan . " They 're all on my side of the fence . " " I was prepared for that , " said Jimmy . " Hey , Lewis ! Are you ready with that blowtorch ? " " I 'm ready , Cud'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Duncan said , " and I aim to use it on the first person tries to burn that lock . " " Whereabouts is your gun ? " Jimmy Tallant inquired . " Right here in my hand . " " Everybody knows that Duncan Harper tells the truth . It 's why he made so many touchdowns . Are you ready there , Lewis ? " " Ready , Jimmy ! " " Okay , then , shoot ! " A single brilliant flare illumined the whole interior , and Lu shrieked once from the cell . - 21 t Council of War The night that Duncan Harper felt duty-bound to go sit in the jail and protect that nigger that had been in England during the war , naturally nobody wanted to get mixed up in it . Still , along about eleven-thirty with the town as quiet as snow , a good many people got restless and drove up to the jail . They stopped in the street where they could watch from a distance , and sat in their cars ; and some rode by time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that there would be any trouble , else they would not have brought their children with them . When Kerney Woolbright got to town , he took Cissy Hunt straight home . Marcia Mae was out on the porch swing in the cold , and insisted on riding up to the jail with him . Cissy was prevailed upon to come inside the house , but it was accepted in the family that nobody could do anything with Marcia Mae . She wore loafers and a slouchy raincoat with a hood and sat in the corner of the back seat . She had been walking in the rain , she said , and was wet . She assailed Kerney with certain remarks . " Wonder what his wife is doing all this time ? " " Whose wife ? "  | " Duncan 's . " " Oh , Tinker , you mean . She 's home with the children , I 'd think . " " Has she changed much ? " " You have n't seen her ? " " No . " " I expect she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute girl , " said Marcia Mae . He drove around the corner without replying . " You see her often , I guess , " Marcia Mae went on . " What 's she like ? " " She 's like herself , " said Kerney . " There 's nobody quite the same . " Marcia Mae would have thought that out of all the average American-looking girls she had ever seen , Tinker Taylor was the most average American-looking of them all , but she recognized the rebuff and took it . Maybe Cissy ought to marry Kerney , after all , she thought idly . He had spoken up like a man . They drew up across from the jail , on the side of the street next to the courthouse , at a little distance from the other cars . Watching across the rainy yard toward the jail , they saw when the windows blazed blue-white , heard the woman scream , and saw the windows light a second time ... . As a matter of fact , the light was a flash bulb . Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once gone off in his face all the time . Duncan Harper 's life had taken an unusual course mainly because his nerve centers enjoyed a remarkable balance . Under extreme pressures toward action , he could reason through any number of possibilities and choose one with as much leisure as he might choose lunch from a menu , and all in the five seconds it was said to take a good tackle to rush the backfield . They said that from the stands he seemed not to be moving at all , that he looked dazed or maybe just lazy , as if he might yawn . Then the pass would be  | aloft and landing , or you would glimpse his heels rounding right end . So when he was standing back of the door with the gun in his hand and Jimmy Tallant said " Shoot ! " and the flash bulb went off , he realized he had the best opportunity anybody could ask for killing Jimmy Tallant . He could have said for the rest of his life that he had thought the flash was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot ; he understood now the strange distances he had noted before in the face which as the light glared pressed upward closer to the bars with a look like a high diver 's plunging toward twelve inches of water in a dishpan . But Duncan did not fire . He would hardly have killed anybody , even someone he despised , and he did not despise Jimmy . A second bulb went off . When Lu 's cry died in the iron , there came the splintering of the tiny bulbs , dropped on the hall floor below . After that , they all went away . They filed out the jail door in the dark , tramped through the cinders , and loaded into the muddy car . When they entered the square from the jail drive and saw cars massed silently in the rain , one of the Granthams leaned from the window and fired a pistol . He may have thought he was shooting straight up , and the car lurched , or he may have had his wrist deflected by the narrow opening of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the ventilation window in one of the parked cars . In passage it sang a tune in several ears and , dying , it angled a scar into a brand-new Pontiac fender . The Grantham , when he fired , had sounded the high-pitched exulting yell that some people say is the old Rebel yell . If anybody had asked him why he fired the shot , he would have said that something came over him . Anyway , before whatever it was came over him and he leaned out and yelled and fired , the people in Lacey who were watching were as ready as Mr. Trewolla to speculate unfavorably on the subject of Duncan Harper . But then the bullet made its little music , and they remembered what dangerous people Granthams really  | were . The man who got his ventilator window broken had his wife and grandbaby with him . Granthams were lawless and bad . Nobody left . They all sat waiting after the load of Granthams had screamed away through the rain : you could hear the gears mesh a half mile away on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they waited . When Duncan 's car at last drew out of the jailyard , some of the townsmen alighted to stop him . He stepped out and stood hatless , talking in the rain . Lights in the nearer cars flashed on , and he was plain there in the crossbeams , his fair hair feathery under a bright crust of rain . He had won again . It was easy to idealize Duncan Harper . He was never proud ; you could not spoil him . He was fine yet familiar-looking . He seemed to present no complicated problem . It seemed he always felt just what a person ought to feel . That night when he stepped out into the eyes of Lacey , ranked behind the black car-hoods and rain-glazed windows , he stepped for a second time in heroism . Then Kerney Woolbright had crossed the street and was drawing him aside . " It 's time you came , " Duncan complained . " What in hell happened to you ? " " I had to get hold of the Humphreys County sheriff and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacey would take sides , we ought to have help from somewhere . " " When I was up there waiting for God knows what , I doubted you were coming at all . I 'm sorry , Kerney . " He put out his hand impulsively , and Kerney grasped it . " What did Tallant want ? " Kerney asked . " What was that light ? " " They took two pictures , " Duncan said . " That 's all . " " Pictures ? Of you , of the Negro , of what ? " " When I heard them coming inside , I told the Negro to get himself upstairs to the death cell and lock the door ; then there was so much racket I did n't hear him go . When the flash went  | off , I noticed him standing there by me , just a little to the back . " " Then you think it 's one of Tallant 's concoctions . " " Yes , and I half suspect the Negro of being in on it . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . " " But what will they do with the pictures ? " Kerney asked . " We 'll have to wait and see . " A car roared round the square and drew up short beside them , splashing mud . It was McCutcheon , the Humphreys County sheriff , enormous in his custom-built trousers . He heaved himself out of the front seat and struggled erect to meet Duncan . Standing , he propped himself up on a stout short walking stick . Two deputies were with him . They remarked that in time past Travis would have asked them in the office and offered them a drink , but they understood everything was changed . They said people in Winfield County had to pick a nigger fight every once in a while these days in place of getting drunk . The Lacey crowd had thinned by the time they drove away . Duncan followed Kerney to his car and sat inside for a moment , out of the rain . " So what about the Negro ? " Kerney asked . " It 's custody he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No excitement after all , " said Marcia Mae . Duncan had not noticed her before and he started , turning , and saw her emerging from the dark bundle on the back seat which he had not even taken for a person . She was shaking back the clumsy raincoat hood from her bright hair . " Since nobody else will lynch him , let 's go lynch him ourselves . " The men were silent . Her confident Hunt voice , with the smoky tint it had always held , framed now and again a Yankee crispness on a word , reminding them of her life 's distance since ten years ago  --  no , nothing that happened here could seem important to her . Duncan pointed toward the courthouse whose upper story rose whitely into the rain , while out beyond , whiter still , the inevitable  | Confederate soldier 's statue held a stern guard toward the North . " Upstairs there , " he scolded her , " twelve Negroes were shot down in cold blood . " " When was that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or was it twenty ? Somewhere along in there . " " Oh , " she laughed . " I thought you meant last year . " " You 've heard about it , " said Duncan , " all your life . " " Yes , now that you mention it . I 've heard it and forgotten it because I do n't care . If I do n't care nobody cares . I 'm no different from anybody else . Nobody our age in town could say offhand who was there or why . " " Jimmy Tallant 's father was there , " said Kerney , " for one . " " Yes , " said Duncan , " and Beck Dozer 's father , for another . " Kerney whistled . " They both knew it , " Duncan went on . " Tallant would do a toe dance around a volcano . I could have shot him by mistake tonight when the flash went off in my face . It looks to me he 's been trying to die for years . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was anybody 's secretary in some big city . And that every morning I got up and put on a gray suit and a clean white blouse and went to work in a beautiful soundproof air-conditioned office one hundred and one floors up , with streamlined filing cabinets and a noiseless electric typewriter . I wish I had a little apartment with a view from the window of nothing but skyscraper tops . Then I would be happy . " " No , you would n't , " Duncan said . Now all the cars had gone away but theirs . They were left with the old square . The two streetlights bleared in the wet . The last car , disappearing , jolted in a rut by the filling station . Its taillight described the corner . Then it was nothing . " Why would n't I be happy ? " she demanded . " You 'd have to get up early every morning , for one thing . For another , you 'd get bored . "  | Kerney felt that the two of them were alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So many things are boring nowadays , " she said . " Why is that ? " " It 's part of getting old , " said Duncan . " I take it hard . Harder than most people do . " " I do n't know whether you do or not , " he answered . 22 A Path Leads Backward If any one household was most afflicted by the new law enforcement principles in Winfield County , it was Duncan Harper 's . On Saturday nights , as Tinker had predicted , people no longer wanted to stop and talk . Wednesday-night trips to the next county for bingo had to go as well . And Jimmy Tallant never came . After the heavy rains , the sun had come out and discovered a jungle . To human beings it seemed that their bodies had got involved in the rich growth ; thinking went laboriously  --  the mind seemed to work like a motor under too great a dredge of oil . Vines drew the fences down to earth , and the leaves on every kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had also become suddenly hot . Down on the terrace just back of the house , Tinker found that grass had forced up overnight between the bricks . She went down on Sunday afternoons with her trowel and scissors , working on her knees until the sun lowered . Her little girl Patsy , freshly out of her winter overalls , ran miniature errands for her , talking a blue streak . The work seemed an excuse for getting out of doors and for meeting Sunday by doing a thing that was not everyday . For Sunday , whether you have a hangover or not , is a restless time . There is the thing that Saturday night held out to you and never quite gave , but there is no use complaining to Sunday . It is stone deaf , and does not even know your name .  | Earlier , Duncan had taken his son for a walk in the woods . The boy , who was around ten , had hair so blond as to be white , and for this reason they all called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's banners ; it had been impressed upon him early that he was not to talk about football outside the family . Usually nobody in the family wanted to talk about it either , but at the moment he was enjoying a day of grace and had felt encouraged to reveal , while crossing a barbed-wire fence , that he had changed his life 's ambition to being a big-league baseball pitcher , instead of a football star . " Why ? Do you like baseball better than football ? " " No , I still like football best . But there 's already a Harper that 's an All-Time Great in football . I want to be an All-Time Great in something else . I thought baseball would be the next best thing . Then when Patsy grows up , she could be a girls ' tennis champion . If Mother has another little boy , he could  --  let 's see , what could he do ? " " Track , maybe ? " " I do n't like track . It 's not a game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . Maybe basketball . Lightweight people are good in basketball . " " Why is he going to be so lightweight ? " " Because he 'll be so little . " " What makes you think Mother wants another little boy ? " " I do n't know . I thought maybe she might . " Duncan sat down . They had gained the middle of a roll of pasture underneath a bluff . The cows had cropped the grass short there . He leaned back on the hillside in the sun . " Mother would n't let you do that , " said the boy . " You 'd catch cold . " " But Mother is n't here . Wo n't I still catch cold ? " The boy caught on and laughed . " I do n't know . " " We used to find Indian arrowheads on this hill . " " Who did ? "  | " Oh , your mother and L " " Was she your girl friend , Daddy ? " " Of course she was . " " Your girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " You had another girl friend besides Mother ! " But these matters did not really interest him . He had begun to tumble about on the hillside like a puppy , making foolish noises . " Do n't act silly , " said his father . " Let 's go down to the branch . " " Can I carry the shotgun ? " " You know I 've told you a hundred times . You can not carry the shotgun . " " Maybe Mother could have two more children , " said Cotton . " Oh ? What 's the fourth one for ? " " Well , ice sports are real important some places . Not around here because there is n't any ice , but up North they are . This would make a good ski jump , if there was ever any ice on it . It would make a good place for a swing . " " A swing ! Who told you that ? " " Nobody . I just thought of it . " " That 's funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that big tree limb . " " Let 's build one here again sometime . " " We ca n't . It is n't our land . " " Whose land is it ? " " Let 's go down this path , " said his father . A bank of plum bushes and willows screened the branch from the pasture . The path down to the watering ford was cleft two feet deep or more into the bank , chopped in slowly by the hooves of cattle . A muscle of current curved into the shaggy bank . Duncan and Cotton jumped to an island of sand , then across the stream . They sat down on the sandy farther bank . The small sound of the current filled the open space between the stream and a thicket of willows . " We used to build dams here , " Duncan said .  | " Dam is an ugly word . You said an ugly word . " " Would you like to build a dam ? " " You said another ? " " Cotton , I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sudden change of tone , the child tried hard not to cry , and finally succeeded . They often said to him on such occasions : " Be a man , do n't cry . " He now said this to himself , and found it worked . " I 'll tell you something that 's true , " said Duncan . " When you want to stop acting silly , start doing something . Now think of something you can do . " " All right , I 've thought of something . " " What is it ? " " Go wading . " " Good , we 'll both go wading . " They both removed their shoes and socks , and laid them up on the grass , away from the sand . Duncan unloaded the gun and put it down on his coat . The water was chilly and only the top crust of sand was warm . The boy 's feet were still tender from having gone shod through the long wet spring . His toes curled at the touch of the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly upstream to where an old fence post lay on the higher bank . He loosened it from one end , lifting it as though from its grave , for an outer strip of it had rotted into the earth . Black bugs shot away into the brush and a few maggots made a sluggish , agonized gesture at the sudden sunlight . Duncan observed this for a moment , then he laid the post in the water , across the narrowest neck of the branch . " What 's that for ? " asked the boy . " Go on and wade , " said Duncan . " I 'm going to build a dam . " He scooped out a ditch in the stream 's bed , laid the post there and leveed it in place with dripping handfuls of sand . Then he began to bring heavy damp sand from the bank . Presently the water downstream ceased splashing . Cotton was standing near him to watch . Drops of bright water fell from his fingertips . Little drying rims of sand had formed on his legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , thank you . " " Please , Daddy . " His father straightened and they grinned at each other , understanding the game . " I thought you did n't want to build a dam . I thought you 'd rather wade . " " I changed my mind . " " All right then . You can help me . " They both began to carry sand in double handfuls , holding it out before them like bowls too full of something . The water backed up gradually behind the dam . It hunted patiently , found the weakest place , and struck through . " It wo n't hold , " said Cotton , staunching it desperately . " I saw some rocks over yonder a little way . And some chunks of log from an old pigpen . " Duncan pointed . " Oh boy ! We could build a big dam with those . " " Sure we could . " " Let 's go . " Cotton began to run . " Wait a minute . Listen . This will be good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here and I 'll go down the branch a little piece just around the corner there and build another one . ' When it all backs up good and strong , you can break this one and make a real flood . Then you can run down to where I am and watch the water break the other one . Wo n't that be fine ? That is , if you do n't mind working hard . " " I do n't mind working . I like it . I can beat you finished . " " Do n't forget to leave your spillway running right up to the last . You saw what happened before . " " I wo n't ! " He ran again . " When I 'm almost through I 'll holler . " " Holler loud . And wait till I answer you . You hear ? " " Okay . I 'll holler real loud . " He was hard at work already , trustworthy , concentrated , and happy . Under the sun that fell on the ruined pigpen , his white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down at the crown . He did not hesitate to tackle heavy loads of rock and logs . The  | big thing was that he and his father were working together . This knowledge , like the sound of the branch , filled the open space he moved in , and more than the sunlight , shadow , or greenness , made its quality . He did not feel it when his legs and arms got tired . He enjoyed majestic securities . He laid the last stone , sealing the spillway . The dam was an austere production , tough with stone and thatchings of wood , packed in with wet sand and firmed across the top . He had worked for an hour . He stood straight and called his father . After he had called several times , he realized the truth . His father was playing a joke on him . The water mounted imperceptibly behind the dam , which was holding well . He ran downstream . When he burst through the plum thicket , a new reach of the branch curved before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and far over to the left a fence corner and a wet brown field beyond , empty and taking Sunday . Besides these , there was only a confusion of new leaves up the bank to his right , and a silence full of birds . There had never been the start of a dam . " It 's ready , Daddy ; come out ! It 's ready ; stop hiding ! " He did not know how many times he raced back and forth , people being always foolish as children when they are betrayed , and children being very foolish indeed . He was suddenly frightened , and returning at a walk through the thicket , he began to cry . Then he stopped dead still . His father was sitting on the higher bank beside the path that they had followed down from the pasture above . He was staring at the boy . The darn still held , but the water had backed up behind it in a pool and begun to swirl . Duncan sat with his head lowered . There was green stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clothes were twisted strangely . " Were you there all the time , Daddy ? " There was no answer , and Cotton wondered for a terrible minute if this man was his father at all . He pulled a weed and began miserably to peel it . The water struck free , first a trickle , then a loud gush , which faded .  | " I built it real good , " said Cotton . When the water made the noise it made , the man seemed to come to himself . With an athlete 's decision of movement , he jumped from the bank and cleared the stream and , bending , swung the child affectionately against him . " It was a wonderful dam , " he said . " It was the best I ever saw . " " But where was yours , Daddy ? " " You know when I went down around the corner ? Well , there was a man came by who wanted me to help him head his cow back to the pasture . We had to climb all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave you by yourself . Let 's go home now . " They put on their shoes and walked back . Duncan shot the gun twice to amuse him . On the way they stopped by Duncan 's mother 's , the house that was low in front but tall in the back , with a long wooden flight of steps dropping down into the back yard . They all three sat together on the steps and ate teacakes out of a crock . When they reached home , Tinker was not long in discovering that Cotton had fever and had to be put to bed . " You should n't have let him go wading , " said Tinker . " It 's May , " Duncan said . " I know , but you know what a late spring we 've had , and the water was still cold , I bet . I bet you let him sit on the wet ground too and probably let him get too hot dragging all that stuff around in the sun . You ought to think about things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to sneeze . " I guess that 's my fault too , " said Duncan . " No , it 's my fault . I took her down with me to weed the terrace , and the brick is still damp . " She turned away from the sink . There was a cup towel , as usual , tied around her small waist and she dried her hands on it , found a piece of Kleenex and blew the child 's nose . Later , after she had put them both to bed in the twilight , Duncan 's mother telephoned and told her how Duncan had come by with Cotton and they had sat on the back steps eating teacakes , what Duncan had said , what she had said , what Cotton had said .  | She lived alone and appreciated every little attention , and she was always wanting to remind Tinker of this . Tinker hung up the phone . The twilight in the house , wide open to the outdoors , had just passed gold . The free Sunday quiet of the light called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it the ritualist 's faith in the innocent trappings of the day : a walk in the woods , playing at the branch , a visit to Grandmother 's , children . I 'm foolish and wrong , she confessed to herself , not to trust what I know I can trust . Duncan , she thought , and at his name tears sprang at once to her eyes . She looked in on the children . Tired from the day outside , Cotton slept already , an arm flung wildly out , and Patsy whispered something , as she was apt to do , and shut her eyes again . Tinker closed the door softly . She moved through the filmy light in the hallway and saw how every pretty thing she had cast its long graceful shadow . From the threshhold of the living room she saw Duncan on the couch . His sleeping hand hung toward the floor . She knelt and unbuckled her sandals and , stepping free of them , went and sat on the bit of couch beside him . She unbuttoned his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the red mark in the skin itself , and beside it the lipstick stain . From long habit , out of even so deep a sleep , he threw his arm up around her , and she dropped down to the floor with a little moan . 23 It Picture in the Paper " It 's happened , " said Kerney Woolbright . He stood in the door of the sheriff 's office . Duncan was alone , Mattie Sue Bainbridge having gone across the street for her morning Coke . He looked up from the desk at Kerney once , then taking greater care , he looked again . " What 's happened ? "  | " It 's come out , " said Kerney . " After two months . I kept wondering . I guess you have too . " " I do n't know what you mean . What are you talking about ? " Kerney tossed a newspaper open before him on the desk . It was a Chicago paper for Negroes ; the outer pages were pink . Negroes were always sending the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or others like it , as if they had n't thought what they were doing or there was n't any other paper around the house . " There 's a picture of you inside , " said Kerney , " in quite a prominent position  --  the one they took in the jail . You 've got a gun in your hand and Beck Dozer is behind you . You look real good . Handsome . " " That 's nice to hear , " said Duncan . " Also , " Kerney went on , " there is an article here about you . It tells how proud everybody ought to be of you , born and raised in Mississippi and yet defending a Nee-grow . Nobody can understand it , but they all think it is wonderful . You are a champion of civil rights , you are a defender of the black race . In Chicago , friend , you are solid . In Winfield County you 'll probably be everybody 's least favorite grocer till the day you die . " " ' Lone hero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of a hapless Negro ? ' " ' Nee-grow. ' " ' ... falsely suspected of a minor offense against a local cafe owner , Sheriff Duncan Harper of Winfield County , Mississippi , successfully turned away from the cell door an angry lynch mob .... ' " " I always said , " Kerney remarked , " that you were everybody 's hero . " " Oh , shut up , and try to figure out who might have sent them this article . " " They have reporters all over the South , " said Kerney . " Tallant may have written it himself . " " It 's signed . ' Cuthbert Owsley . ' What a name ! It sounds like  | a Tallant-type invention . How else would they get the names , the dates , all the details ? But we ca n't go on guesswork . We have to know . " " The trouble with that is , it takes time , and we have n't got the time to waste . The first thing to do is to hit back good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print a handbill and show Tallant up for what he is . " " I ca n't accuse him without knowing . " " You do n't have to accuse . You can insinuate . I 'll write it , or rather we can do it together . You can suggest that Tallant bribed the nigger to pose for the picture , then sent the story in . You know that 's the size of it . But you 've got to say it quick . " Duncan shook his head . " I 've got to know first . When I walk back across to the grocery store , I want to go with my shoes clean . " " You got in trouble before by not listening to me , " said Kerney . " You were n't born and raised in Winfield County , Kerney . You would n't know a lot of people around here as well as you do if it had n't been for me . The Hunts , for instance . I gave you a good name with Mr. Jason . " Kerney stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " " I 've always thought we had the same feeling about things . If I 'm wrong , why then ? " " You are n't wrong ; we do . " " I 'm willing to risk losing a race to ? " " But that 's just it ! " Kerney cried with a sudden lost wild boyishness . " It does n't matter to you ! " His picture , labeled Candidate for the Senate , Third District , had just appeared on the telephone poles . He recovered quickly and , stepping toward the desk , laid his hand palm down between them . It was a long-fingered , thin hand , the kind that held the pen that was mightier than the sword . " I 've got to have this county 's record , Duncan . " " I want to see you win , " said Duncan . " I 'll do everything possible to see that you do , that we both do . " " If Tallant and Grantham get back in the saddle ? "  | " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the brains there , and I wonder if he really wants to lick me . " They looked at one another , and both of them thought of Tinker . " Meanwhile , " Duncan continued , pointing to the paper , " I 'll have to work this out in my own way , Kerney . " Mattie Sue Bainbridge came back . " Miss Winfield County Courthouse , " said Kerney , " of 1950 . " He laid his hat across his heart . Mattie Sue wrinkled up her mouth and blushed . " You 're the craziest thing ! " she said . " Give me a piece of tablet paper , Mattie Sue , " Duncan said , when Kerney had disappeared . He bent over the paper at the small desk by the window , writing laboriously with his left hand . " dear Mr. Editor : I am a negroe in Wingfeeld county , Mississippi , who wish to get in tuch with the man who sent in the peice which tell about mister Duncan Harper our sherriff . You say the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of this name in Wingfeeld . It is important to some of us negroes because we have made up a club ( secret ) for our civil rites and wishes to find all who will help us . Yours truely , A. P. Abbott . " He sent Mattie Sue to the post office with the letter along with a note to the postmistress to put any mail for A. P. Abbott in the sheriff 's box . Three days later an answer came . " Cuthbert Owsley is the nom de plume of one of our valued correspondents in your area . His name is Mr. Beckwith Dozer . We wish you great success with your civil rights organization . " Duncan read it over twice and a pair of eyes seemed to be regarding him out of gold-rimmed glasses . " This does n't make any sense at all , " he thought and , catching up his straw hat , went out to find Beck Dozer.  | 24 Beck Thinks It Over Duncan drove to the tie plant , but it was shut down for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then another , until he reached the mailbox with " Dozer " written on it . The ink had bleared under the " Z. " He left his car on the road , close in beside the bank , and climbed the narrow dusty path where a child had been playing with spoons and snuff bottles . The house was a plain two-wing country house with a hall down the middle and a gable to the right . Once at the top of the bluff above the road the ground was flat as a pan and went flatly back into the wood behind . The fence around the front yard was fancy calf wire that had seen better days ; the front gate was weighted with a plowshare . No one was in sight , yet the sense of human presence lay strong everywhere , as in the old story of the ship that is found empty at sea . Duncan minded his country manners and stood by the gate , calling . " Anybody home ? " " Home ? ' " said the wood behind the house . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved inside the gabled window . In the back yard a dog barked and would presently trot around the corner of the house , stand in the front path , and bark again . Duncan waited . After so long Beck Dozer emerged into the hall and came directly down the steps . " Git away , " he said to the dog . He wore new overalls and an old work shirt that clung to his small shoulders . " I 've come to ask who Cuthbert Owsley is , " said Duncan . He held the Chicago paper in his hand . " You already know , " returned Beck . " Do n't you ? " " Then I have another question too . " " Go ahead . " They talked across the gate , standing equal distance back  | from it , not lounging against it as two white men might when they talk together , but looking straight into each other 's eyes , and Duncan commenced to see the advantage of Beck 's glasses . " What crazy streak makes you do business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn if all the niggers in Winfield County get wiped out one way or another as long as he has a free hand on Highway 8z ? " " Mister Tallant and I are tied together on account of what his daddy did to mine . He would n't lose me , nor let me come to harm for anything in this world . He 's my main protection in this life . That and he pays me for what he gets me to do . He 's paid me high as $200 for some jobs . You take that night I was up at the jail with you . That 's what he gave me for it . " " So how did you really get your hands cut ? " " That was the only hard part . I did it myself on somebody 's new bob wire . " " These Chicago articles  --  what are you trying to do with them ? " " They pay pretty good too . I gave you a good enough name , did n't I ? " " You gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the sheriff 's race , and you damn well know it . If you 're trying to help your people ? " " I do n't run in pack , Mister Harper . I 'm not trying to help anybody but me . I said that when I came on back down here to live after the war was over . Any Negro with little enough sense to choose to come back to Mississippi to live , had better hew his own road and not look to right nor left . " " Is that what you call yourself doing ? " " It 's what I does . " " I do n't believe a word of it , " said Duncan with such force the Negro fell silent . " You 've seen a light these days , " Duncan went on . " All of you have . You keep casting around for the best way . You want to deal equally with white men but you do n't know who to trust .  | You 'd rather have Mr. Willard Follansbee in office instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Harper , I prefer the status quo . You can climb the status quo like a step ladder with two feet on the floor , but trying to trail along behind a white man of good will is like following along behind somebody on a tightrope . As he gets along towards the middle his problems are likely to increase , and soon he gots to turn loose of me to help himself . " " I stayed with you at the jail , " Duncan reminded him . " I did n't like it , but I did it . You were the one cheating that night , not me . " " I remember . " He stood blinking for a moment , then he opened the gate . " If you 'd care to step inside the yard a minute , Mister Harper , there 's something I 'd like to show you . " To their right , tall althea bushes framed a path that led down to a house scarcely larger than a privy . Beck unlocked the door and pushed it wide . Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benches and two tables faced a raised platform with a desk and chair . Behind , a blackboard was set neatly into the wall . The three remaining walls were lined with bookshelves , these giving way only to the windows . From an iron stove in the far corner came the scent of coal dust . " I lights a fire in here every so often during the winter . They tell me damp is not good for books . " Duncan glanced over the shelves . They held mainly leatherbound sets , perfectly arranged . Many titles were in Latin with authors he had heard of somewhere ; memories stirred in him of vague desires he had once felt to know what these very books said . His own reading had been largely in the English and American books his professors had talked about most , and later in modern books that Kerney was apt to like mentioning . And he remembered , too , one night in summer sitting in the porch swing with Marcia Mae , how Nan Hunt had come out to bring them coconut cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of time out of the freezer , salt-packed for Sunday . They  | begged her to stay and talk to them , and somehow the talk turned to reminiscence  --  somehow she had come to say , her voice very sweet , " I wonder what happened to the old library Senator Upinshaw gave to Robinson Dozer when he died ? I suppose they must have destroyed it when they killed Robinson . A thing like that knows no bounds . " " They left the library , then , " Duncan said to Beck . " And the school too . " " I used to say that to myself , " said Beck . " At least they left his books the Senator gave him . At least they could n't touch the books . But you know , Mister Harper , it finally came to me why they had n't done it . You know why ? They did n't do it because they did n't care . " " Can you read these books ? " Duncan asked . " No . Can you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man I ever showed the inside to . " " You 're the first Negro I ever invited to my house to talk business with . I need your help . " " Help for what ? " " I want to expose how Tallant got that picture . I want you to be in on it . " Halfway to the gate they stopped . The Negro grew cold right in the sun and shook . He could not answer the white man with any poise , so he stood noticing the sights of the season . The chickens shuffled for worms on the spring ground ; wood smoke came from the washpot out back along with the slap of a sheet being pounded on the board ; jaybirds screamed in an oak tree down near the road . The dog slept , sprawled in the sun . A little naked Negro boy came out the door and halfway down the front steps , where he squatted like a savage . " Git back in the house , " Beck told him . " What you mean outdoors without your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you , Mister Harper , you are the only white man to see inside my papa 's school , but Mister  | Jimmy Tallant knows it 's there because he asked me once what it was . I think maybe he 's thought too , So they left the books , and then I think maybe he 's gone on to think , They left them because they did n't care . Mister Tallant and I , we 're yoked up together , you might say . There is n't anything one of us thinks that the other one has n't thought too . They say a nigger 's got to belong to some white man . " " You believe that ? " " No , " said Beck , and sighed . " I wo n't force you to come , " said Duncan , " or pay you anything for doing it . " " Lord knows , the Granthams will have my hide on the door before night come , if I do this . " " I count on Mr. Tallant , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hurt you . " " You do n't think ! It 's not you , it 's me ! " " It might be me ! It could be me ! Do n't you know it might come to that ? " " All right then . I 'll come . " When the gate stood between them again , Beck asked him , " Why you wants to act like this , Mister Harper ? " and one of his dark cheeks gleamed wet , smeared down from the gold rim of his glasses lens . " No reason , " Duncan returned . " I want to do what 's right , I guess . That 's all . " The slight Negro stood watching the big genial figure of the white man descending the steep path with paced , confident control of motion , and he felt his unease deepen . In a country where the motives for doing things are given names like honor , pride , love , family , greed , passion , revenge , and hatred , " right " had an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought that he had warmed the books so carefully and now needed warmth himself . He entered the house and there sat his wife 's grandmother , Granny ( Aunt Mattie , the white folks called her ) , drawn up to a little low fire .  | " Granny , are the Harpers Yankees ? " He had struck a moment when her mind was clear . " No , son , dey 's here all along . Dey 's cu'us , dat dey is , but dey ai n't Yankees . " " Cu'us how ? " " jes ' cu'us . Jes ' like I say . " 25 Talk on the Lawn " Looks like Duncan 's done him a do , " said Jason Hunt . They had sat out on the lawn since supper and now it was dark , and their shapes in the wicker chairs scarcely impressed another shadow . But they saw each other clearly , through long knowledge . Kerney was there , his long legs stretched out in the grass , elbows propped on the chair arms , fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his shoe he scratched his leg where a mosquito bit him , or a gnat . The gnats were getting worse . Nan Hunt kept a Flit gun beside her and sprayed every few minutes . It was the only time of year , she said , when she approved of her daughters ' smoking . " But you smoke yourself , " said Marcia Mae finally . Everybody had waited so long for somebody to say this , there did n't have to be any answer . Old Mrs. Standsbury , sitting erect with her thick short legs crossed , said , " Yes , she certainly does . " She was wearing her sack against the night air and kept her hands thrust in the folds . She wore a diamond pin low at her throat , which was soft as a girl 's . " You tell them about it , Grand , " said Jason , using the children 's name for her . He had had in him a love for her growing many years . There would never be any need to mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in his life . " I never wanted any of my children to smoke , " the old lady said , " but they all did it anyway . " " Just like Cissy , " said Kerney , wanting her name in it . 129  | " Huh ? " said Cissy , who had not been listening . She knew she was sitting just beyond where Kerney would have liked her . He wanted to hear her breath , or graze her arm as though by accident when he raised his hand . A little out from the rest , in a loose peasant skirt , one knee hugged against her , Marcia Mae sat low in a canvas beach chair , a huddle , darker than the others . " You approve of how he 's handled it , sir ? " Kerney asked . " Duncan ? Yes , I approve in general . I think he might have done it quicker . I think he might have talked to me , to somebody older . " " I talked to you , you remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he never comes to me . " " Must he ? " Nan Hunt inquired . The edge was in her voice . " Apparently not , " said Jason , dryly . " What did he do ? " Cissy asked . " I 've told you three times , " said Kerney . " You do n't listen . " " I 'll listen now , " she said . " What did Duncan do ? " " Oh , Lord , " said Marcia Mae . " You do n't ever read the papers ? " her mother asked her . " I read the funny papers , " she said . They laughed . " Tell me , " she insisted . " Grand does n't know either . " " Do you know , Mother ? " Nan asked , raising her voice . " Know what ? " She was a little deaf . " About what Duncan did . " " The piece in the paper , you mean ? " " That 's right . " " What did she say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . " " Certainly I know . I read the paper every day . " " She keeps up , " said Jason . " Well , you children wo n't let me cook or work in the yard with Jonas . I have to do something . I ca n't crochet all day long . " " There , Mother . You 're exactly right . " " Of course , she 's right , " said Jason .  | " For crying out loud , " said Cissy . " Will somebody tell me ? " " Yes , somebody will tell you , " said Jason , " but where do we have to start ? " " You 'll have to go back to when Duncan was born , " said Marcia Mae . " Then you 'd better tell her , " said Nan . " You 'd know more about that than anyone else . " But Marcia Mae fell silent , and Kerney at once commenced relating : " It was just after Duncan closed up the highway place ? now you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro named Beck Dozer came to him and asked for custody , claiming he 'd got in a fight with Bud Grantham and Bud was sure to get him . It was raining like hell and Duncan could n't locate anybody but Jimmy Tallant , who claimed they 'd taken Bud back up in the hills , maybe to die . Duncan shut the Negro up in jail , but old Trewolla 's not the most forceful character in the world , and Duncan was n't easy in his mind . He did n't want either to sound the alarm over nothing , so he just stayed up in the jail with the Negro . Sure enough , the Granthams came and Tallant with them , walked right by Trewolla and were heading upstairs for the Negro when Duncan stopped them . At that point , they shot two pictures with a flash bulb and went away . " " That was the night , " said Jason , " that one of the Granthams fired a gun out of pure devilment and almost hit old Morris 's grandbaby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cissy home early from the picture show in Clark . " " I remember that . It was raining . " " Yes . Then finally , the picture of Duncan and the Negro in the jailhouse comes out in a Chicago Negro paper , the kind they 're sending out all over the South now , with an article saying Duncan is a defender of the colored . Come to find out the whole show was a put-up job  --  there never was a fight with Grantham ,  | and Dozer was paid a fat fee for his part in it . This lays the carpet for Follansbee to walk into office . It was a stunty way to do it , but Tallant is that kind . " " He likes to play games , " said Jason . " It amuses him . " " Why could n't Duncan just tell everybody how it all happened ? " Cissy asked . " Because in politics , " said Marcia Mae , " everybody agrees to confuse a perfectly simple issue that everybody understands . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did do , Cissy , but he had to tell it in some forceful way , in print . He came out with a paid political statement in last Sunday 's paper , containing along with his own statement a sworn statement by Beckwith Dozer . Is that nigger still alive , Kerney ? " " So far as I know , sir . " " He wo n't be living here much longer , then , " said Jason . " Duncan also stated , " Kerney continued , " that he was not the willing subject of comment from any outside group , that as long as he was sheriff he was managing things for the constituency and nobody else . " " So that 's the size of it , " said Jason . " I suppose he 'll run it again when the campaign heats up and they start circulating that picture and the Chicago article as handbills . " " There 's going to be money poured in against Duncan , " Kerney said . " From who ? " Cissy asked . " Who indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell whisky in Winfield County . " " Then Duncan will have to circulate handbills , " said Jason , " reprints of his article , and the whisky people will go in with the Chicago Negro people to circulate more handbills denying Duncan 's handbills , and the beer people will go in with the Baptist Church , only the Baptists wo n't know it 's the beer people , and circulate handbills saying Keep Whisky out of Winfield County , and Tallant will still make money because somehow or other on election day with everything shut up tighter than Dick 's hatband ,  | everybody is going to contrive to get " ? he slapped a mosquito ? " Goddam it  --  dead drunk . " I have my objections to Duncan , " he went on , " and always have had ; still he 's a decent sort of fellow , and I hate to see him get lost in this sort of mess . " " Is n't there a chance he wo n't get so lost as you think ? " Nan inquired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to go in over his head . I 've noticed that about him . " Marcia Mae stirred restlessly . For a few minutes past , heat lightning had been flashing in the west . Kerney said respectfully but firmly , " I 'm not sure that 's true of Duncan , Mr. Jason . I see a lot of him . He thinks the time has come to progress a little , but he wants to do it in the right way . Does n't that always make people seem slow ? " " Jason means to say you ca n't be right unless you talk to the right people , " Nan Hunt said . " God knows , Nan ? ! " It sometimes seemed to Jason that his wife had turned into evil . The front screen door slammed , and brought them all to notice that Marcia Mae had left them . " So now , Cissy , " Kerney asked , " do you understand ? " " About what ? " asked Cissy . Later she followed him out to the car where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the car and had a cigarette and she let him kiss her a few times . Then she drew away and laid her cheek down in the window , against the metal of the door . Honeysuckle smelled so strong you could not even smell the car . " I know about Duncan and Marcia Mae , Kerney . " After a long silence , he said , " How did you know ? " " She goes back in the woods to walk sometimes , and one day I was out near where the path goes down to the tennis court when I saw her coming up through the trees . She looked pretty and happy and she was singing something , then she saw me . She got mad , and mean  --  goodness ! She said I had followed her . It made  | me so mad I could spit . I went and told Mother on her and Mother said we all had to be patient , that Marcia Mae acted peculiar because her husband had got blown up and she went off by herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't unhappy when I saw her before she saw me . But I did n't say anything to Mother and then I knew about Duncan . Goodness ! " She laughed . " A scandal in the family . You guess everybody knows it ? " " People have been waiting to know it ever since she hit town , " Kerney said . " How did you know ? " " I went by the office to find Duncan a couple of weeks back . He was n't in , so I went to his house . Tinker was sitting out in the back yard with the lawn mower , trying to make up her mind to get up and use it . Then she looked up and saw me and I knew I 'd better not say , Where 's Duncan ? God bless her . " " You feel all that sorry for her ? " " There 's nobody like Tinker . " " It 's funny . Men always feel that about Tinker , but she does n't have any girl friends at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's the only thing . You think , Oh , Tinker Taylor . The one that chased Duncan Harper till he finally married her . She 's nobody but old Gains Taylor 's daughter . " " I do n't think anything of the kind . I just think she 's hard to talk to . I tried to talk to her at the garden party last summer , but she would n't say anything . " " She probably felt uncomfortable in stockings and heels , " said Kerney . " She 's the original woman . All the rest of you are playing paper dolls . " " Well I like that ! " He held her back from opening the car door and they scuffled a moment . " Want to go for a ride ? " " No . " " Want to go get a Coke ? " " No . " " Want a drink ? " " No . " " Want a kiss ? " " No . No , no . " " Cigarette ? " " Umm . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " he asked her . " If it 's true ? " " About Duncan and Marcia Mae ? It 's their business , I guess . It 's her own life . That 's the way she 's always acted . " " But what do you think ? " " I think she 's crazy , " said Cissy . " Where 's the future in it ? " Kerney shrugged . " Maybe they still love each other . Maybe he 'll leave Tinker , and they 'll get married . " " She would n't have him . She would n't before and would n't again . " She said this in her chill proud little voice . He put his hand under her chin and turned her face to his . " But if he was n't married and if you were she , what would you do then ? " " You would n't catch me on a deal like that . I used to have this awful crush on Duncan . I still just think he 's wonderful . But you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go jump in the lake . " " But suppose  --  suppose it was me instead of Duncan ? What would you do then ? " She stared at him a moment and then burst out laughing . " Why , Kerney Woolbright ! If you are n't the craziest thing ! Do you think for one minute  --  Kerney ! " " Hush , " he said . " Stop laughing . " She stopped finally and put her cigarette out , snuffing it carefully in the ash tray . " I 've got to go in . " She turned to him . Her face , serious , lovely , melting , came lifting toward him , and to herself she knew exactly how she looked in her young softness . She saw herself better than she saw him , how her eyes were velvet , her mouth tender , and her dark hair all intricate with the swelling night . So he kissed her and as they drew apart his hand , in midimpulse of caress , fell short and touched her cheek instead . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's terrible deflections . That night he lost more than his usual quota of sleep over her , twisting on the crumpled sheets , eluded continually by a mosquito .  | Cissy , meanwhile , quarreled with her mother about having to go back down and latch the screen , played the radio awhile , filed her pretty nails , and went to sleep . 26 ; The Rejected Ones The blue glitter of Tinker 's little Chevrolet , coming out of the east , was marked by Jimmy Tallant long before he saw her inside or knew she was going to stop there . He stood with his hands in his pockets out in front of the roadhouse , which was now no more or less than a filling station with a couple of gas pumps , a Cocacola cooler , and a snack stand . He or Bud opened the place just enough to keep up their license with the gas company . As a matter of fact , Jimmy liked to be up there by himself . He had his morose side , and alone he watched endlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west , admired the triumphant boom in their descent , or from the long shimmering eastern approach the razzle-dazzle of the new cars in the sun , making such a little sound when they passed , exactly like an ounce of air pressure being released from a tire , and there went a ton of sweet metal , lancing at eighty toward the Mississippi and beyond . It was not the cars themselves that intrigued him , though questioned at any moment he could have said instantly what make , what year , and what model , but the sense of the linked immensities of America , the feeling that he and his two gas pumps and roadhouse were all another flicker in the eye of the traveler who found nothing there out of place . So the long hot hours passed , one after the other : Charleston , Atlanta , Birmingham , Meridian , Shreveport , Dallas , Houston , El Paso , Tucson , San Diego : the sun blazed on them all , and everywhere a man stood before a roadhouse , near two gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he saw the car that looked like Tinker 's and he forgot  | the U.S.A. , for she was slowing down , a quieter dazzle tossed about the blue hood , and the gravel crackled beneath the tires . " Well ! " He leaned into the window . " If it is n't herself . The rich man 's beauty and the poor man 's dream . Get out , lamb child . I wanted to see you most in the world . " Beneath her dark glasses her mouth smiled . She wore , as always , a true lipstick color . For coolness her dark hair was caught up from the nape by a black grosgrain band . " Where 've you been , honey ? " he asked . The red mouth talked to him . " Over to the picture show in Clark . " " The picture show ? Right after lunch on a day like this ? " " Well , I got somebody to keep Cotton and Patsy for a change . I walked right out the door when she walked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The mouth hesitated . " Is n't that silly ? I ca n't even think ? Jimmy , I wanted to ask you if you knew a Negro to do my wash . Duncan is wearing about a dozen shirts a day . I do n't know why shaking hands with people should get so many shirts dirty . " " Everybody asks me about niggers since Duncan shut me down . But hell , I ca n't even find anybody to wash dishes in my own kitchen . You might try Beck Dozer 's wife , though . She 'll take in a little sometimes if she needs the cash . " " I 'll drive by there now . " " You know how to go . It 's the old Wiltshire road , the first cutoff past the covered bridge . " " I remember . Yes . " She did not move to turn the ignition . " But you could n't remember the name of the show . " He still could not see her eyes . He did not need to . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead down on them . " Oh , Jimmy . What am I going to do ? " " I do n't know , baby . You 've just got to ride out the storm , I guess . " " They 'll never come apart . Only she  --  if she 'd been any kind  | of woman she never could have left him before . How can he forgive her now ? " " How can you forgive him ? " " I do n't forgive him . I ca n't stop loving him , that 's alI . " " Then there you are . " " You remember how she used to play tennis when we were all in high school ? All afternoon ; I can see her yet . In white shorts and a black leather belt and a white boy 's shirt . She could hit a ball as hard as a boy . She 'd throw everything behind the racquet , leave the ground . Grit her teeth . I bet when she 's in a rut she gets like that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , " said Jimmy . " Come inside out of this sun . There 's a room in the back where it 's cool . " She opened the car door . " We 'd better drive it around to the back , " he said . " Lacey is another name for the Gestapo . " " You think I give a happy damn ? Let them see the car . Let 's make it all more interesting for them . " But he shoved her gently over and took the car around to the back himself . Just off the office was a bedroom where he and Bud used to take turns about sleeping the morning through when the business was on the boom , and they did n't shut down till dawn came and bled the neon . It was neat , this room , with a linoleum rug , a brass bed , a cane rocking chair with a cretonne-covered cushion , and a pair of straight curtains in the window which the Negro cook had made himself out of a pair of flour sacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chamber-pot set stacked up on the dresser . A Negro had once offered it to Jimmy in exchange for a fifth of whisky . Jimmy had no use for it , but he pitied an honest thirst . Later it came in handy , for Bud had been known to rent the room to couples when the little houses out at the side were all filled . Jimmy raised the window and propped it in place , then turned on the electric fan . " It 's shady back here now . Lie down , honey . It 'll be cool in here in a minute . "  | He brought back two Cokes from the cooler and packages of Nabs . She took a few thirsty swallows and then sat holding the bottle , forgetting it . " Jimmy , what am I going to do ? " " My theory is that you work this kind of thing out so that you live it one day at the time . You do n't see things in big blocks of months and years , or what awful thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's see . What am I going to have for supper ? " " I 've said that already . I already know . " He saw her neat kitchen where there were no gadgets : the smooth marble slab she rolled the biscuits on , the grease-blackened pans she cooked her muffins in , and the big butcher knives , not bought out of a store , but the kind the Negroes made out of scrap steel , the hickory handles steel-hammered in place , and she had a whetstone too . One time during one of her summer parties when they had all gathered down on the terrace she had been slicing some ham in the kitchen and had cut herself . Duncan , who had been drinking more than usual , had picked up the knife . " Look at the size of this thing , " he kept saying . " Her hand is about the size of a baby 's . You would n't think she could pick it up , you would n't think ? . " He held it out before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy remarked , so that Duncan 's hand went tight on the hickory handle . They all knew each other too well . She , meanwhile , had stopped the blood herself , having recalled something she learned in Red Cross class about a big vein ? she forgot its name . Jimmy turned her wrist and there lay a small white line . " The thing is , " she was saying , " no awful thing is going to happen . They can go on like this forever . She does n't want a husband , she just wants a man . You think she wants to cook and keep a house ? You think she 'd love a child if she had one ? " " I think it 's possible that she might . " " She does n't love anything , she would n't know how . She does n't know what love is. "  | " Let 's get off this one , Tinker . Everybody knows about love . Men , women , children , and coon dogs . They all know . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey . I 've loved you all my life , for instance . You think I ever have to tell you or anybody else ? " " Oh , Jimmy . " She began to cry a little and he sat down by her to comfort her , holding her against his shoulder . " It should be after a high-school dance , " she said , even smiling a little . " Except I never got you on a bed before . I suppose I neglected to mention it . " They remembered his long agonized speeches , the times he used to break out laughing at himself . " Yes , you did once before . The night Marcia Mae 's and Duncan 's engagement came out in the paper . I went to Memphis with you and went up to the hotel room with you . " " And then got drunk and then got sick and then passed out . You never gave me a chance . " " I 'm such a common girl . I do such awful things . You did n't think less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " How do you manage , Jimmy ? Duncan always says you like to be unhappy . That if you were happy you would n't know what to do . " " Duncan pursues happiness and I do n't . That 's the whole difference . He need n't talk smug . Right this minute I may be a sight happier than he is . " She sighed and dropped her head . " Men like to talk . " " You think it 's all her fault , do n't you ? " " Of course it 's her fault . She left him , ran off with that lumberjack . " " Honey , he was n't a lumberjack . " " All right , what difference does that make ? The minute she came back she started after Duncan again . " He was silent . " Well , whose fault do you think it was ? His ? "  | " I do n't think she would have left him if he had n't failed her someway . " She stiffened to make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can sit here for hours and say nasty things about them . " He smiled . " Well , let 's do . " " Let 's be mean . " " I hate blondes , do n't you ? " " Despise them . They tell you lies . " " And they 're dumb . " " And stuck up . " " And mean and ? " " Jimmy ! " The shout from outside the empty roadhouse struck them both silent . Jimmy said rapidly , " It 's Bud . I 'll put him off . The door there goes into the rest room and it opens out the side . You can watch your chance and get out that way . " The next instant he was through the door to the office , and she could hear Bud Grantham calling again , and Jimmy answering . 27 A Hasty Conference They met in the office door . " Have they come yet ? " Bud asked . " Has who come yet ? " " Who 's back there then ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't give me that . There 's a car out back . " " Oh yeah , I know . Hanley sent his nigger in the Chevvy demonstrator . Somebody told him his new hog-wire fence was broken down back in the bottom . The nigger left the car up here in the shade . "  | " I thought they might have come . " " Who might have come ? " " Sam called this morning . I left word at the house with Bella . " " I have n't been home . " " You did n't eat at home ? " " I ate uptown , at the cafe . " Bud said , " You ai n't doing right by my little girl , Jimmy . And her with a chap to care for . " " Listen , " said Jimmy , " there ai n't a woman living in this world do n't say Praise God when her husband ca n't make it home to dinner . I was only being thoughtful . You think any man likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his own table ? Now come on . What about Sam ? " " He called from New Orleans , or rather got Mitchell to call for him . He ? " " Jim  --  meee ! " The door far up toward the front of the roadhouse slammed and they heard the drag of loose heels on the concrete floor . It was Bella . They both lowered their eyes , like boys caught in something . Neither one of them ever really wanted to see Bella . As a matter of fact , Jimmy liked her better than Bud did . She frequently amused him ; he sometimes pitied her ; and when he felt both of these things at once he became quite fond of her and could make her happy for weeks at a time by letting her know it once . But the only thing she ever did to Bud was make him nervous . She stood in the door where Bud had moved out of it . She was wearing the flowered wrapper , the one they had told her when she bought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had believed them , and a pair of high-heel sling-back white shoes , grass-stained , with the heels broken inward and the strap that was supposed to hold them up lying under her instep . She wore the baby at her waist as if it were a big bow tie . She said to Jimmy , " Are you back here ? "  | " Looks like I am . Does n't it ? " She giggled . " Silly ! Daddy come by the house this morning . He said to tell you there was a man from New Orleans called ? Daddy ! Are you back here too ? " " Wipe his mouth , " said Jimmy . " I did n't bring nothing for it . " She caught up the hem of her skirt . " I should have worn a tie , " said Jimmy . " We could use that . " He looked at the child . " God damn , what a face . Come here , Buster . " He took the baby and held it folded together under one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew extremely happy and began to sputter . " Miss Annie Miller uptown , " said Bella ; " she told me yesterday he looked exactly like you . " " She must have lost her eyesight , " said Jimmy . " He looks more like an Apache Indian chief than he does me or you or Bud or half-dozen Granthams all put together . " Ile thrust the baby suddenly in Bud 's face . " You notice a resemblance ? " he inquired . " See anything you want to claim ? " The baby was indeed uncommonly dark . He had a thick crop of spiky black hair that stuck out around his brow , saucer fashion . " Koochee koochee , " went Bud , wiggling one tough old brown finger . " Koochee koochee koo . Do n't give him to me , Jimmy . Fannie had seven but I was ever a-scairt to hold one . Koo , baby . Koo , baby . Koo . " " Whose car is that one I saw out back ? " " Huh ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craned out the window . " Hanley 's nigger he sent up to check the fence down in the pasture . Left it up here in the shade . " " Hey , Tallant ! " The door of the roadhouse banged again and a man 's voice rang . " Old home week , " said Jimmy . " I think it 's the Candidate . " " I called him , " said Bud . " Sam will want to see him . That was all right , was n't it ? They aim to put the skids under this Harper thing . We might as well put all we got behind it . "  | Jimmy sighed . " Sure , I know . It 's just that Follansbee is my personal nomination for the man least calculated to put me in a mood for weaving daisy chains . " Willard appeared in the door . " Well , " said Jimmy , " if it is n't the white hope of Winfield County . Only you look more like the black hope than the white one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're running for office you 've either got to look like a one-gallus tramp and slobber tobacco juice , or make a halfhearted pass at looking like a gentleman ? When did you shave last ? " Follansbee touched his chin . It was not really a chin , only a gable on his neck . " This morning , " he said . " I shave every morning . It just grows so fast , that 's all . Means I 'm virile , Jimmy . Full of sap and spark . " " That ai n't the way I heard it , " said Jimmy . " How 'd you hear it ? " " It means you 're going to grass . For a fact it does . Did n't you know that dead people 's hair keeps growing , growing , growing . That 's all they 're busy doing . Going to grass . " " O00000 ! " said Bella . " It 's the truth . I read it in a magazine . " " Bella , my heart , " said Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here ? There must be a whole pile of things the mother of one has to do around the house . " " Travis 's hair , " said Willard dolefully , settling back on his head the hat he had lifted as Bella left ( he lifted it now about a million times a day ) . " I reckon if that 's so what you said , his old red hair must be a yard long by now , with five months to grow in . " It 's laying all around him in the coffin , " Jimmy said . " All around his shoulders . " " Hush up ! " Bud Grantham said . " You 're tempting the devil , Jimmy , you and Willard , talking about the dead . It ai n't fittin ' . " " Well , we 've all got to join him someday , " said Willard . " It 's a fact , " said Jimmy . " I do n't dispute it , " said Bud . " Jimmy , about those folks that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He caught the phone . " " You both know what they want . They want to put money back of Willard . " " Money , yes , " said Jimmy . " But why come up here ? " " Well , " said Bud , " to see where the money 's going to go to , I reckon , just like anybody else . They 've had experience in these things . " " That 's just the trouble , " said Jimmy . " They 've had too much experience . I do n't know if I like it much . " " We 've got to have their money to fight this Harper thing . " " That 's what they want us to think , " Jimmy said . " That we 've got to have it . " " Well , do n't we have to ? " Willard asked nervously . He was at that point in a race  --  about six weeks before the election ? that comes to every political candidate whether he is running for the Presidency or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas : he had to win . It had become a total necessity . " I do n't like the way the wind 's blowing , " said Jimmy . " Look . They come up here , they offer to pour money in . Flow much do you think they 'll offer ? " " We mentioned five thousand , " said Bud , " the first go-round . " " But they 're making a special trip . Suppose they mention ten thousand , fifteen ? What then ? Do we take it ? " " We 'd look silly not to , " said Willard . Jimmy turned on him . " Will you keep out of this ? What do you mean we ? You do n't own a stick of this place . It 's Bud 's and it 's mine , and what we say you abide by . " " I never meant to meddle , " said Willard . " What do you think we ought to do then ? " said Bud . " You got to hurry up , Jimmy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking maybe we should n't take anything . " " Nothing ! " Willard squeaked . " Look , " said Jimmy , " I planned the right way to throw this thing our way and there 's no reason on earth why it wo n't work . All you got to do is keep it up and keep it up and keep it up that  | Duncan Harper is a nigger lover . The keystone is the picture we took : we embroider from there , we quote him , we tell stories about him , and maybe none of it is quite the truth , but we 've always got to lead back to that picture which is down in black and white and nobody can dispute it . " On the other hand , if we get scared and take this money , what then ? We win the race , but we 've sold ourselves . We 've sold our right to say how much gambling equipment we want to put in , who we aim to hire and why ; pretty soon we wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the cash . They can sweet-talk all they want to about there are n't any strings on this money , but you know and I know , Bud , that there are always strings . It 's exactly like taking federal funds to build your houses , to plant your land , to buy your cotton nobody else wants . No strings on that either except pretty soon the government owns your soul and you sit and cuss it till you 're blue in the face , but if somebody mentions taking that precious parity away from you , you squall like the last of a noble line threatened with imminent castration . I 'm sorry but I 'm too much of a states-righter to see this any other way . If you 're subsidized you 're sunk . I 've got a natural love for the business Bud and I had built up here together , and I 'm enough of a Winfield County citizen to want to tell those sons o ' bitches to go back where they came from . " " It 's your business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't know , " said Willard gloomily . " All that talking is all right , Jimmy , but when the time comes you have n't been coming down the line . " " What do you mean ? " " You pulled that one off after I tipped you the National Guard was coming up : they did n't find a drop . Okay . But two weeks later Harper comes out singlehanded and shuts you down . There were those standing by to cart him off neat and quick that night , but you stalled . Then up at the jail , okay , you wrapped that one up , picture and all . But two weeks later Harper gets the nigger  | to come out and say it was a put-up job and what then ? You do n't lay a finger on the nigger . You do n't let anybody else tend to him either . It ai n't like you , Jimmy . There are those that keeps on saying you 're just projecking around , that you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harper 's wife 's got the Indian sign  --  now , I never said it , Jimmy . I never even thought it . But if people are saying it , then you ought to know about it , is the way I feel . I honestly do . " " He sho ' do n't lay a finger on that nigger , " said Bud . " And wo n't let nobody else . " " Seems like it 's you that 's the nigger lover , " said Willard . " If a nigger double-talked me that way I 'd have me a showdown before nightfall . " " All right then , run it without me , " said Jimmy . " I 'll get out right now . Walk out of here and never come hack . Bud , you can write Willard 's speeches . Willard , you can bargain with Sam and his crew . Both of you can decide how much money you want , how much share you 're willing to give for it . I 'm tired anyway . It 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , Here I am thirty-five years old and I 've never seen Niagara Falls or Mammoth Cave . Or maybe I 'll go West . There 's things to see ? " " Jimmy , for God 's sake , " Willard said , " I think I hear the car . Whatever I said , I take it back . " Bud Grantham hauled his shoulders together . " It 's nothing to prank about , boy . Old Bud would n't know his own name without you to tell it to him . " The screen door far out front slammed and numbers of footsteps sounded and stopped . There came a murmuring , but this time no one called . Jimmy went out to greet them . He hoped to hell that Tinker had seen her chance and taken it , but he had not heard the car .  | 28 ; t . The Gang Visits Lacey This time there were four of them . There were Mitchell again and the Indian-looking man , Pilston , and the boy who carried the gun for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who did not weigh very much , and though all the I men were taller than he , he did not seem short either . He wore a light blue Palm Beach suit , crisply pressed , a white shirt , and a navy tie with a maroon figure . He was bald with a benevolent rime of white hair , and his eyes were a clear blue . He gave a sort of definition to the two older men who were with him : Jimmy had not thought of them as thugs before . But he failed somehow to define the boy who carried the gun . He only made him seem younger than ever , and chewing gum that way made it seem a toy pistol that he wore beneath his arm , probably one that had come full of candy . Jimmy shook hands with the boy heartily . " Hello , Wally . Still like your work ? " " There ai n't any work to it , " said Walter . " All I do is ride around in the car and look out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thing yet ? There ai n't been anybody mean enough to shoot ? " " It looks like it , " said Walter . " Only it ai n't shooting anybody they got in mind . No more than a policeman shoots people . I 'm kind of like a policeman , see ? " " That 's a new one , " Jimmy said . " What about that , Mitchell ? The kid here says he 's like a policeman . " " We explained it all to him , " said Mitchell . " We talked it all over with him and we all came to that conclusion . That 's right , ai n't it , Wally ? " The boy grinned , shifting the gum to the other jaw . " ' At 's right . " " This boy here , " said Sam to Bud Grantham with pride , " can  | shoot a gun better than anyone I have been privileged to observe . I 've had some idle time in recent months and I 've spent pleasant hours watching the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . He simply does not miss . " " Is he really that good ? " Jimmy asked Mitchell . " He can shoot all right , " said Mitchell . " How good are you , Wally ? " Jimmy asked . He liked Wallace . He felt he knew him by heart . Wallace grinned . " Well , up in Tippah County where I'us bawn , that 's where I learned to shoot , from my Unker Chollie Klappert  --  up there they usta say I could take the middle claw off a kilidee 's foot on the far side . It always come easy to me , shooting . " " Chollie Klappert your blood uncle ? " Jimmy asked . " Sure is . " " I 'm kin to them myself . That makes us cousins . " " Well I swan , " said the boy . He was pleased . Sam said , " I dislike to change the subject , but I think we 'd best get down to business . This office is all right , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now if we could have some light out in your main room and pull two of the tables together ... ? " He gestured toward where Jimmy sat in the window , blocking the larger part of the view with his shoulders . " Sure , " said Jimmy , " We can do all that and we can serve you a drink of whisky for real hospitality . But we better tell you first off that Bud and Willard here and me been talking this deal over and we 've decided that we 're against it . We 've got this election sewed up anyway ; there 's no need for outside help . As for the business we do with you after the election , we 've discussed that months ago , before Travis Brevard died , though I never got to sound him on it . Willard here has been sounded and is agreeable provided certain interests of his own are protected . Bud and I , we deal with Willard , and we deal with you and we deal with Duncan Harper . We do the dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink on former contracts and call it a day . I 've got ? "  | " Jim-mee ! " The screen had banged again and the heels were sounding on the concrete . Bella was back . She would have the baby with her , Jimmy knew . He took advantage of the moment to look out the window , and he could stop sweating , for Tinker had got away . Bella stood in the door . She always wanted to look at people up close . She used to meet everybody that stopped even long enough to use the rest room back when the roadhouse was open , and now she was lonesome , and to add to it she needed a certain number of people every day to tell her how cute the baby was . She had on make-up this time and a proper dress . Jimmy spieled out the introductions without even uncrossing his knee . Sam was smooth as butter  --  it was enough to make you cry ; and Mitchell got clumsily to his feet . The boy from Tippah County took Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it would seem that women carrying babies had showed up in most situations of his life . So the turn passed round to the fourth , the Indian-looking man , and Jimmy still could not remember his name . It was the name that stopped him , and while he was still staring trying to think of the name , he found instead that the face he was looking into , framed with spiky black hair , was more familiar than it had any right to be and still be on a man whose name he could n't call . He saw that the face was muting like the coils in a juke box from scarlet to purple , the way a baby 's face colors when it screams its head off at night for nothing but pure unadulterated meanness . The room had grown deathly silent , until at last Bella , who had apparently been hard put also to remember the man 's name , burst into a smile of innocent delight . " If it ai n't George ! George Pittman ! " " Pilston , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure . What on earth made me say Pittman ? I declare , I said to Jimmy the other day that I 'm alltime getting ? " She trailed off , seeing that they were all silent and downcast , and at last her face burned ( for memory walked as slowly into Bella 's brain as a solitary hen in midafternoon deciding for some  | reason to climb the crosswalk and hop into the henhouse ) . She looked wildly from Pilston to the baby , who were staring at each other in primitive horror , the baby 's face unfortunately reflecting not only Pilston 's every feature but his emotions as well . Then she said , " Oh . " It was a little sound uttered in a little girl 's honest voice , and on it she turned and fled . After a time Jimmy Tallant gave a short laugh and walked out of the room . Every so often things happen to a person which are like others that have happened , and in these things , even if they are bad or foolish or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he is at peace . He had grown up in the shadow of what his father had done  --  all his growing indeed had been raising his head closer to that knowledge . Tinker had not chosen him . Even in the blind senseless dark of poor Bella another man 's seed had contrived to run home and lock the door against his own . But not being really a bitter person , it was not that he thought so much about it as that he felt cast back again into his old lonely freedom . So as he went down through the field to the woods back of the roadhouse , having recalled an appointment to meet Beck Dozer , he went whistling absently , and once picked up a stone to see how far he could throw it . Back up the hill in the roadhouse office , Bud Grantham at last straightened from where he had been leaning against the desk with his shoulders hunched to let his old tough brown head sink low between them . When he stood up he looked gravely around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best go and see about my girl . Her mother died when she was scarce the size of that one with her and I was never the one to raise a pack of little chaps , as time over and again it 's proved to me I was never the one for it . " Leaving , he drew out a great handkerchief , and from outside they heard him honk his nose . Sam , all the while , had sat cleaning and paring his nails with a nickel-plated gadget . His hands were white , clean and firm , like a surgeon 's and he cut the hangnails cleanly free on all ten pure  | white , without a trace of blood . He at last folded the gadget back upon itself and dropped it into his coat pocket . He dusted his knees . Then he looked at Mitchell . " Ignoring various family complications which have arisen , I conclude that Mr. Grantham and Mr. Tallant do not wish to do business with us today . " " It looks like it , " said Mitchell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long hot drive ahead , and before someone or other of them decides to come back and shoot Mr. Pilston here , I suppose we had best be on our way . " He made a gesture of rising , when Willard Follansbee , who had been thinking in the corner for some time , said , " Wait " in a tone of despair . " Yes ? " said Sam . " He do n't want to win the race , " said Willard . " He ai n't going to lift a hand to win it . Everybody knows it . " " Not want to win ? Why on earth not want to win ? " " I 'll tell you , but do n't you say I told you . He 's crazy about Duncan Harper 's wife . She can turn him any way . " Sam sat thinking . " That clears it . I thought myself , he does not want to win . " He straightened . " Go get him , Mitchell . " " Where from ? " Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . " " He did n't go home , " said Wallace , the boy , who had been sitting where he had a glimpse out the window . " I seen him head down that field and towards the woods . " " You go with Mitchell then , Wally . And quickly , please . " 29 3f , ' The Point of Panic As Duncan had once before , Tinker came to Beck Dozer 's house , saw where the " Z " had run on the mailbox and drew her car into the shallow curve out of the main road . She ascended the path to the gate and stood outside it .  | " Anybody home ? " " Home ? ' " said the wood . A young Negro woman , thin and straight as a broomstick , dressed in a straight-cut gingham dress , came down the steps and out to open the gate for her . Her head was wound in a white rag and she wore straws in her ears . " Come on in , " she said to Tinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day . " Tinker accompanied her to the house . The Negroid effluvium touched her round , mingled with a drift of wood smoke from the back , and the scent of spring water which draws itself clean out of the earth and brings with it of all earth only its black odor . " Does Aunt Mattie still live with you ? " she asked . She had suddenly , by the smell of the house , remembered the old woman , though she had not thought of her for years . She had been very sick once when she was a child , and Aunt Mattie had invited herself in and stayed with them and nursed her . When the fever left her , she was weak as a baby and had to learn to walk again . Aunt Mattie would take her up in her lap and sit near the window with her . It was April and the spring was just turning to a deeper warmth  --  this was a new time and Tinker felt herself new again . With fever 's sensitivities she had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking it too , but Aunt Mattie had not wavered and had had no time for them : the spoon with the food in it had come at her in the black hand with the nails bluegray like the silver spoon , had come at her , and come again . Her mother cried in the kitchen , " You put bacon grease in it again ! " and wept she was so vexed . In bed Tinker heard it and her tongue came out and licked . That was why it had tasted so good and strong and black , not because it came off the blackness of the hand with the spoon . When she sat weak in the window and Aunt Mattie held her feet together under an old piece of cotton blanket , she thought she had been born out of Aunt Mattie 's lap . Aunt Mattie was not a bit modest . " Mattie done save this precious , " she told her . " Had n't been for Mattie you 'd be gone from here .  | Yo ' mamma don ' know nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Yes 'm , Granny 's here . You wants to come and speak with her ? " Tinker followed her inside , through a dim hallway where a door led off into a large room with a bed in the corner and chairs grouped around a cold fireplace . In the far rocker , the largest , Aunt Mattie was waiting out the time under an old pile of quilts . Her thin hands kept together on her lap , and her head leaned to one side as if trying to catch a little light from the window . The hair was white , kinky and very short : it hugged the old skull and made a neat fitting of itself , all the way around . The wrinkles ran downward and were cleft deep ; Aunt Mattie had not played around with age . She was so nearly blind she was aware only of strong sunlight . Yet she could hear well enough . " Here 's somebody come to see you , Granny , " said Lucy . Tinker put her hand on Mattie 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aunt Mattie . " The old hands moved caressingly , exploring the fingers and wrist with a fine tremulous dry touch . " I doan ' know you , chile , but doan ' tell me . Talk twel I hears your family voice . " " When I was sick one time you came and nursed me . " " They ai n't a chile in this town ca n't say I did n't . White folks doan ' know nothing about they churen . " " I 'm married now myself , Aunt Mattie . I 've got two children of my own . " " I hears your voice now . You 's Emmie Taylor 's chile . " " That 's right . " " I mind the mawning they tole me you 's sick . I was down by the branch at the ole place , boiling sheets . They come down the heel and say to me , You know Miss Emmie Taylor 's little girl ? They had to keh her home from school today she took so sick . So I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmie Taylor Cain ' keh for no sick baby . So that 's when Mattie come , honey . " " You saved my life , Aunt Mattie , " said Tinker , kneeling down so that her hand rested comfortably between the fingers that held so lightly , pressing now and again to emphasize a word . She had not meant it so , but when she knelt tears came easily , rushing , and fell warm oh Mattie 's hands and her own . Mattie did not question her . " There , baby . There . Hit 's going to be all right . " Her head sank then and she cried all over . Mattie groped across her head , her shoulders , caressing her . " There , baby . There , baby . She Mattie 's chile . " She rose when she was done and found her bag for a handkerchief . Lucy had retired , who knew when , or would ever know ? She was a Negro , and her tact was of this quality . The room rested deep in twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back fondly toward Aunt Mattie , but did not return . She knew that Mattie now perhaps thought she had come yesterday or last year , and would not know her if she spoke again . The tears had left her exalted and hushed . She thought with a gratitude as immense as a clear sky that today there had been Mattie and Jimmy to ease her . She sat down gravely on the porch steps . A man ran into the house from the back steps . It seemed that Lucy had entered the hall from some side door the instant that he was calling , " Lucy ! Lucy ! " Tinker sprang up and saw him say , " I gots to run , Lucy . It 's Mister Jimmy Tallant . Somebody shot him ? " " Lawd , Beck , was it you ? " " No , but they 'll think so . They thinks so now . " " Who thinks ? How come they thinks ? " " I was coming along the path , hoping to see did Mister Tallant have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a shot , right close , but I never thought nothing except it was somebody  | out hunting , till I looked over in the edge of the pasture and there was a man laying and nobody else near . I come up close to see who and there was blood running out and I says , ' Oh God , it 's Mister Tallant ! ' " " Was he dead ? " " I do n't know . There was n't time to see . Then 's when I saw two white men walking away up at the rise of the hill toward the highway , and I thought I better get away from here , but one was coming back already , pointing at me and hollering , You can say what you want to , but we know you did it , nigger . We saw you and we know and you sure better run ! You better get lost , nigger ! ' " " Oh Jesus , Beck ! " " What chance I got , Lucy , if they say it was me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy , as fast and far as I can .... " Tinker was running herself by then , back along the path to the woods that Beck had fled from . She was the first after Beck Dozer to find him . Bud Grantham , some little time after the New Orleans car had driven away , had begun to look for him here and there , and so came upon them both in the dewy ' corner of the pasture just at dusk , she on her knees in blood beside him , tearing cloth from his shirt . " Call an ambulance ! " she cried across the field . He ran at once to obey , not completely understanding . He felt that day that his tough old heart had been grieved once , and now again , beyond anything it had been fitting to expect . To Bud nothing seemed to be happening decently , and it was at this , as much as for fear that Jimmy was seriously injured , that he almost wept as he made for the telephone .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
