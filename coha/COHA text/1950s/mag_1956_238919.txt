Newly arrived from Antarctic waters , the Soviet whaling factory ship Slava and the U.S. icebreaker Glacier lay within hailing distance of each other last week alongside the broad quays of the Montevideo waterfront . Russian Captain Alexei N. Solianik paid a courtesy visit . He was gravely received on the quarterdeck by Rear Admiral George J. Dufek , got an illustrated lecture on the Glacier 's part in Operation Deepfreeze , and a copy of R. B. Robertson 's 1954 bestselling memoir . Of Whales and Men . On his way down the gangway , he invited the U.S. officers to pay a return visit . <P> Two days later Admiral Dufek , Commander Eugene Maher and Ensign John Wilson stepped aboard the Slava , were promptly whisked to Captain Solianik 's cabin for a few fast rounds of whisky and vodka . After weathering several toasts , Admiral Dufek explained that he was a vegetarian and could not stay to lunch . He departed with Commander Maher , leaving Ensign Wilson to represent the U.S. Navy . <P> Seated at a table under a large picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through an eight-course meal ( including caviar , crabmeat , mushrooms , capers and sturgeon ) , rose repeatedly to respond to vodka toasts . Three hours after he had arrived , he retrieved his cap with dignity from under a picture of Stalin and walked firmly down the gangway , carrying himself like a piece of priceless porcelain and bearing farewell gifts of caviar and whale 's teeth . " Do n't bother our distinguished guest , " said genial Host Solianik to pier-side reporters . " He 's still enjoying the pleasures of the table . " <P> Ensign Wilson 's feat impressed even Uruguayans , themselves no mean trenchermen . Montevideo 's daily La Manarta called him a " hero of the cold war . "
