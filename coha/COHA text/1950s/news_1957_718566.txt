txt COLLEGES CHART EXPANSION HERE $250,000,000 Will Be Spent in Next 10 Years to Meet Rapid Enrollment Rise By BENJA5IIN FINE Public and private colleges in New York City , on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties will spend $250 , - 000,000 in the next ten years to meet rising enrollments . The quarter-billion-dollar program includes $100,0012,000 for public institutions and $150,000 , - 000 for independent and churchaffiliated colleges . Virtually all the colleges in this area have planned " expansion programs . St. John 's University estimates that its expansion program will cost $25,000,000 . Fordham University 's proposed construction in the Lincoln Square project will require about $12 ; 000,000 , according to the university . Projection of Enrollment The $250,000,000 will be spent both for buildings and teachers , but the bulk of the money will be earmarked for construction . The colleges already know the number of graduates they can expect from the high schools in the next ten years . In 1956 the high schools in the metropolitan area graduated 73,040 students . Ey 1960 this will rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . High school rolls are not only increasing but more of the graduates are going on to college . Present enrollment in the'sixty colleges in the metropolitan area is 200,000 , including full and part-time students . It is considered possible that this number will double by 1970 . This ratio would be in line with estimates // of a national college registration of 6,000,000 in 1970 , about twice the current number . Both private and public college officials are aware of this potential growth . Under the direction of Mayor Wagner , a joint coordinating committee drawn from private and public colleges has been formed , with the city underwriting the cost of an executive director and other personnel . The municipal colleges here get the largest number of high school graduates . The four city colleges  --  Hunter , City , Queens and Brooklyn  --  have a combined day session enrollment of 27,000 ; the over-all enrollment , including evening and special sessions , is 78,425 . City Program Under Way According to Dr. Joseph B. Cavallaro , chairman of the Board of Higher Education , the facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next five to ten years . The municipal colleges have a $51,000,000 capital budget program under way . A new School of Technology building is planned on the uptown City College campus ; the Bronx campus of Hunter College is building a new classroom , library and administration building . Queens College will construct a health and physical education building , a music and arts structure and a classroom building . Dr. Cavallaro is hopeful that part of the state 's proposed $250,000,000 bond Issue will be earmarked for the city , especially for its teacher-training program . " If we receive a fair share of this issue , " he said , " we will be able to admit many more students preparing to be teachers . " Standards for admission to municipal colleges are ' higher than those for most private institutions . High school students must have an academic average of 82.6 per cent . The cut-off point varies ? it depends on the number of applicants . During the war it was as low as 75 per cent . Brooklyn College for several years has frozen its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit expansion . The buildings are in use from early morning until late at night . A year ago a limit of 8,500 was placed at the School of General Studies. , State Bond Issue Pending Dr. Harry D. Gideonse , president of Brooklyn , said that 2,500 students were denied admission Iast fall to . the General Studies School because of inadequate facilities . 4.4'For the community , " said Dr. Gideonse , " this means that 2,500 students  --  and manty more to come in succeeding years ? who would have qualified for admission to some type of educational program in the past , were now deniedfati opportunity to prove themselves . It is a significant warning of the pressure that is ahead for all of us . " The $250,000,000 program involving pubic and private colleges is in addition to the vast building program that will spend about $417,000,000 to expand the State University . A $250,000,000 bond issue will be submitted to the voters this fall to start that five-year program . The State University of New York , whose president is Dr. William S. Carlson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the needs of the rapidly growing college enrollment . But the expansion has been held insufficient to meet the new needs and in the $417,000,000 venture the state is planning its greatest building program for public higher education . Established in 1948 , the State University is highly decentralized now , consisting of thirtyeiqlit units spread over the state , with a total enrollment of 30,000 full-time and part-time students . The greatest expansion to take place on the public college level in this city and in the suburbs will be in the area of two-year community colleges . Dr. John ? J. Theobald , president of Queens College , ano Deputy Mayor , is the liai-in officer between the public and private institutions . Dr. Theobald said the community college could fill the growing gap for collegiate facilities . New York City may get five or six community colleges . A two-year college opened on Staten Island last fall . Another is planned for the Bronx , and a two-year college is planned for Queens . Although Manhattan has its Fashion Institute of Technology ? a community college Operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general nature is under consideration . " The costs to provide all the college facilities needed within the next ten years will be prohibitive , " said Dr. Theobald . " We must plan ahead and provide a coordinated program for the public and private institutions . Unless that is done , we will find that it will be impossible to get enough space for those who will seek higher educational opportunities . The twoyear community college appears to be the best answer . " Program Variety Suggested The best method to meet the expected college growth , said Dr. Laurence J , , president of Fordham University , is to offer a variety of educational opportunities , not only the traditional four-year liberal arts program . Dr. is president of the New York . State Association of Colleges and Universities , comprising all the higher educational institutions in the state . Full cooperation between public and private institutions is essential in planning new facilities , he said . Both types , he continued , need financial strengthening for the task head . He noted that all students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education ; those who can not should be helped through a public and private scholarship program , Anticipating Enrollments Many of the existing colleges have mapped plans for a substantial increase in their enrollments . New York University reports , for example , that by 1966 it will have grown from its current 38,000 students to 50,000 . A long-range program of physical development is in progress . Dr. Carroll V. Newsom , president of N. Y. U. , stressed in common with the other educators that new community colleges could play an important role in suburban areas where the number of high-school graduates will increase considerably . " Such local colleges , " he said , " could offer both two-year terminal programs and the first two years of regular college instruction with students going to fouryear institutions for the last two years . " The colleges demonstrated their ability to handle many more students after World War II when the G. I. Bill brought large numbers of - veterans to the campus . We are much better prepared now than we were then to handle large numbers of students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island must brace , itself for a heavy increase in high school and college students . Last year Nassau and Suffolk Counties had 9,900 high school graduates . By 1960 this number ' will go to 21,080 and by 1970 to 47,330 , according to a ; study made by the Board of , Trustees of the State University of . New York . The trustees estimate that by 1970 the Island will need facilities ? for 24,400 four-year and 10,800 two-year college students . The existing facilities in Long Island today are able to cope with only a fraction Of the expected demands . All institutions combined provide facilities for about 5,000 students and they expect 10,000 by 1970 . Adelphi , Hofstra and C. W. Post on Long Island now provide the major share of higher educational facilities . Adelphi has an undergradaute enrollment of 1,885 , but a total student body of 4,213 . Paul Dawson Eddy , president of Adelphi , reports that , if funds were available , his college would thcpand by 50 per cent in five years and 100 per cent'in ten . Hofstra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several million dollars worth of construction is under way . Plea , for Cooperation The demand for more facilities can be met , said Dr. John Cran- ' ford Adams , president of Hof stra , by cooperative expansion by Federal , state and local agencies on the one hand and by private institutions on the other . " Community colleges , " Dr. Adams said , " sensibly located and integrated with other institutions , private and ' public , will ease pressure and resolve a number of problems . " The State University has proposed three community colleges ' and one senior college for Long Island . The senior , college would be a three-year ' institution , providing courses for the upper two years and for a graduate year . In addition , the Board of Regents has approved a teachers college at Stony Brook , L. I. Long Island University , with its C. W. Post campus in Nassau County , plans a heavy expansion . Its present enrollment of 250 is scheduled to go to 1,375 by 1960 , and to - 2,300 by 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centre , L. I. , opened a year ago with forty-three students , is slated to enroll 600 three years from now , and 700 by 1970 . In New York City , the private colleges are prepared to expand on both undergraduate and graduate levels . Yeshiva University , for , example , with an undergraduate enrollment of 1,353 , will go to 2,500 by 1970 . The university announced last week the founding of a graduate college of education to train teachers . It also plans to expand the medical facilities at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx . " Community colleges , " said Dr. Samuel Belkin , president of Yeshiva University , " can play a vital bole in providing a stopgap education . for many students . It can help , raise the level of education for the many thousands of students who terMinate their education at the high school level . " Some Holding to Line Some of the larger private colleges do not intend to increase their enrollment to any substantial degree . The Columbia University undergraduate division will not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bronxville . Dr. Harold Taylor , president of Sarah Lawrence , observed that the possibility of expansion for the private liberal , arts colleges with a resident population was much slimmer and involved an enormous investment of capital sums not easily available . " The private liberal arts college , " said Dr. Taylor , " has an essential role to play in the development of the system of higher education . The expansion program for them will be a severe struggle with many more problems than the state and municipal institutions . They may need outright grants for buildings , scholarship programs and increased facilities . The grants should come either from the Federal Government or from the states , preferably the latter . " Most educators and college administrators , believe that . the greatest expansion in New York and the suburban area will come through a two-year community college program . The attitude on community colleges is summed up by Dr. Hollis L. Caswell , president of Teachers College , Columbia University , who notes : " It is my judgment that the substantial expansion of community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected growth in college enrollments . This solution , is the most economical one in that students can often remain at home for the additional two years . Studies in California have shown that graduates of junior colleges succeed as well in later study as those who ' take their full course in four-year , institutions . "
