txt No company putting out is product is likely to cheer when the price of an essential ingredient goes up . But the company is on dubious ground if it tries to elevate the price increase into a kind of moral issue . This tendency has become unhappily noticeable in the newspaper industry , though by no means confined to it . A Canadian manufacturer has just announced a boost in the price of its newsprint , and other producers are expected to follow suit . The American Newspaper Publishers Association , as well as various individual publishers , promptly denounced the action . One- note that runs through the criticism is this : Profits of newsprint manufacturers are high , hut those of many newspapers are not . This discrepancy , it 's suggested , makes the new increases " unjust and unjustifiable . " What manner of argument is this ? Is it the duty of the steel mill to see to it that the auto maker is able to maintair a specific profit margin ? We would have little steel and few cars if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user 's profit has little to do with the considerations which cause a producer to raise prices . That is not to say that a newsprint producer , or an ' , comparable manufacturer , can be oblivious of his market . If he r. sensible he vitt not ask a prire higher than he thinks the market will pay . And if he mad% ertentiv does that , he will shortly enotn , i , rectify his mistake by lowering his price At least , that is the way it works in a free economy . The trouble with much of the criticism along these fines is the assumption that newspapers , because they perform a special and essential function in a free society , are therefore in a special business category . A newspaper , however , can be free only by being a going business enterprise . To try to give it special treatment through price controls or other state intrusions is to begin to undermine the very freedom of the press about which so ninny profess to be concerned . If there is price-fixing in the newsprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities can take care of . But we think the habit of assailing every price increase with irrelevant arguments of " injustice " is unjustified .
