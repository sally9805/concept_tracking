For their discovery of the ability of the poliomyelitis virus to grow in cultures of different tissues , as the citation dryly put it , three U.S. scientists last week won the coveted 1954 Nobel Prize ( $36,000 ) for medicine . They were Harvard 's famed Virologist John Franklin Enders , 57 ( no M.D. but a Ph.D . in bacteriology and immunology ) , and two who had worked with him on the project : Dr. Thomas H. Weller , 39 , of the Harvard School of Public Health and Dr. Frederick C. Robbins , 38 , now of Cleveland 's Western Reserve Medical School . <P> Recognition of the great accomplishment of Enders &; Co. came because it served as a steppingstone for Pittsburgh 's Dr. Jonas E. Salk ( TIME , March 29 ) , who developed the actual polio vaccine . But to Connecticut-born John Enders , the polio virus discovery is an incident in a life dedicated to battle against the minutest and most insidious of man 's microbial enemies , the viruses . To find better ways of combating such children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polio , it was necessary first to find better ways of growing the offending viruses in the test tube . The polio virus was an especially bad actor : it seemed willing to grow only in brain or nerve tissue of men or monkeys , and any vaccine prepared from such a growth would be potentially deadly . <P> Enders ' team had some success growing it in tissues from human embryos ( after therapeutic abortions ) , but these are hard to get in the U.S. Next they tried human foreskins , which are more plentiful . Finally , they found a way to do it in tissues from monkey kidneys . Equally important , they perfected a mechanical technique which has been adapted to assembly-line mass production , and gave Dr. Salk and other researchers enough viruses to work with . <P> Laboratories around the world are full of other viruses growing happily in Enders tissue cultures . For years to come , progress against many another disease besides polio will be made by researchers standing on Enders ' steppingstone.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
