The scene is the interior of an old but now renovated farmers ' hotel , the village of Rockbottom , in Eastern Pennsylvania . Specifically it is the interior of two rooms on the main floor , the lobby and the bar . At about centre is a dividing wall in which are swinging doors . At Right in the upstage wall is a double door , the main entrance to the hotel from the porch , which is presumed to be four or five feet above sidewalk level . To the left of the main entrance is the desk , curved , old-fashioned , with a registry , ink-stand , tap-bell , pigeonhole mailbox , old-time gas cigar lamp , etc . This desk is continued through from the lobby to the bar , the bar and the desk being one piece . In the lobby are a few comfortable chairs and a pot-bellied stove . In the bar are a few tables and bentwood chairs , and behind the bar are the usual bottles and glasses and an old-fashioned National Cash Register . The time historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark outside . At rise we discover IRA STUDEBAKER , the owner and proprietor of the Farmers Hotel , with a dustcloth in his hand , and busily polishing here , dusting there , trying light switches , straightening the registry , etc . At the moment he is alone , and permitting himself a pleased smile whenever a light switch actually works , standing back to admire this and that . He is a likeable man well past middle years but not an old man . He is wearing a vest but not a coat , and a gold watch chain is strung across the upper part of his vest . He is a man who would be likely to wear a vest on the hottest day of summer . He wears high-laced black vici kid shoes and , at the moment , a black bow tie . He is far from stylish , yet he is rather neat and certainly clean . Between little acts of polishing and cleaning he pauses to examine his work , rubbing his hand down his vest as he does so , a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is whistling  --  no tune  --  in a preoccupied way and his general manner is that of a person who is putting the finishing touches to his work . In one of his pauses he suddenly goes to the desk and taps the bell , which is one of those tall , authoritative ones seldom seen nowadays . He taps it three times , spacing out the taps and smiling at the bell . As the sound of the third tap is dying down , a man in a white linen jacket enters from the dining-room , which is offstage Right . ( In entering he passes the stairway in the lobby , detailed description of which is to be made by the Author for the Set Designer . ) The newcomer is CHARLES MOULTRIE MANNERING , a tall , thin Negro , with handsome features like a Confederate cavalry officer in an old family portrait . He limps slightly , not in the seriously handicapped way . He carries a feather duster . CHARLES Yes sir , Mr. Studebaker. p. 3 IRA Oh , I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I was n't doing anything . Just sitting back there in the kitchen . This duster , it ai n't even for show . Just did n't think to put it back in the closet . IRA Well , everything seems all right to me . All in readiness . CHARLES Appears to be . IRA The only thing I did n't test was the bell . CHARLES It came loud and clear all the way back to the kitchen . That is , if it was three times you rung it . Three times was what I heard . IRA Three times is what I rang . But not too loud , I hope . I would n't want it to ring too loud . CHARLES I would n't let that worry you if I was you . I always like to hear the bell ringing in a hotel . You know : " Bing ! Front , boy . " I always like that . IRA Yes , that 's right . CHARLES In a hotel , that bell means business . It means they 're getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I owned a hotel I 'd like that bell going from morning till night . IRA I never thought of that before , but it 's a fact . CHARLES Personally , I even like to hear the bell ringing when I 'm passing a fire house in the city . p. 4 IRA You do ? CHARLES It means they 'll be rolling , the fire trucks . It do n't always mean a serious fire . Sometimes a false alarm . Sometimes  --  Mr. Studebaker , did you ever happen to take a look in the newspaper , where they have a list of yesterday 's fires ? IRA ( thinking back ) : Mmm-mm CHARLES You take a look some day . Most of the time it says , Loss , trifling . Loss , trifling . You take a look at one of them big hook and ladders on their way back from a fire . Those firemen , hanging on there , waving and smiling . I always get a wave out of them . IRA Yesss CHARLES Those firemen , they 're glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the way I figure , they 'd rather be at a fire than sitting around the fire house doing nothing . IRA Oh , they keep busy . I understand they do a lot of work repairing toys , broken children 's toys , for the poor children at Christmas . Repairing , painting CHARLES Mr. Studebaker , if you signed up to be a fireman , would you want to spend most of your time repairing children 's toys ? IRA No , I guess I wouldn't. p. 5 CHARLES No sir , you would n't . Not judging by the work you put in on this place . No sir . On the other hand , if you took a job in a toy factory  --   --  IRA I would n't want to spend my time fighting fires ! CHARLES Exactly . I studied you pretty closely these last few weeks . No , I like the sound of a bell because it mostly means something . Speaking of which , I have a little suggestion . IRA Every time you made a suggestion it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , sir . This is my suggestion , on that bell . We ought to arrange some system . Signals . IRA Right . CHARLES One ring , maybe that stands for " Front , boy ! " IRA Mm-hmm . CHARLES Two  --  I do n't know what the two should stand for . IRA Two could mean , somebody is checking out . CHARLES Okay . IRA Three ? CHARLES We do n't need a three . IRA We do n't ? CHARLES The one for somebody checking in , the two for somebody checking out . Three is too many anyway . Try it . p. 6 IRA ( tapping three times ) : Yes , it is too many . Unnecessary . CHARLES Unnecessary . Three sounds like a fire house . IRA Yep . Well , we 've got that settled . Shall we fling open the doors and welcome the public ? CHARLES Fling open the doors ? You want me to fling open the doors in this weather ? I 'll fling ' em open , if that 's what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( going to the door and looking out ) : Well , I 'll be ! Look at that snow ? When did that start ? CHARLES Shortly after two o'clock this afternoon , it started lightly . IRA Well , I 'll be . It just shows you what concentration . I 've been so busy around here I never gave a thought to how it was outside . Never even looked out the window once , all afternoon . CHARLES I said to myself around ha ' past three , I said if this keeps up we 'll start out busy . The transient trade . We ought to do a big supper business . I said so to Mrs. Fenstermacher . IRA I do n't know . We 're pretty far from any main road , Charles . CHARLES Yes , you said that all along . But when you get a heavy fall of snow , like this one here , people get lost from not being able to read the signs . Some fellow gets a flat tyre and he do n't want to fix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get somebody to fix it for him . And if he sees a nice cheerful hotel he 's gon na come in and ask us is that garage the only one in Rockbottom , and where can he get in touch with the man that runs it ? Takes off his overcoat and has a toddy . Nice warm stove . Two or three more toddies . We serve supper here ? Do we have rooms ? Why should he walk all the way back to that car in all that snow ? Spend the night here in this nice warm hotel , with all these surroundings . Where 's the telephone ? Calls up . Ed  --  or maybe he calls his wife , Betty . Ed , or Betty , my car broke down in a place called Rockbottom . Snowing like hell here , so I 'm gon na spend the night at the Farmers Hotel . Call you in the morning . Then he hangs up , orders another toddy , says where can he wash up , and settles down and relaxes . p. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? CHARLES If there 's a man in that predicament . I ai n't saying that 's the only way , but I guarantee you , we 'll have rooms occupied tonight . I bet we do a good supper business . That 's what I told Mrs. Fenstermacher . IRA Well , I guess she 's prepared for it . CHARLES Prepared , all right , but sceptical . She said that 's the way it 'd of been when there was horses and carriages . But automobile people , they want to hurry to one of them modern hotels in Allentown or Bethlehem . But I said yes , but maybe they 'll hurry themselves into a ditch . And any port in a storm . So she said to me , Charles , you been right about so many things , maybe you 'll be right about this . IRA I hope you are , not that I want to get any business out of people 's misfortune . CHARLES I look at it the other way . What a lucky thing for those people we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Honest people running it . In the olden days , you heard about merrie England . A traveller that stopped at the first inn he came across , he run a pretty good chance of getting his throat cut and nothing more ever heard of him . That was a common practice . If it was me I 'd be mighty pleased to have a little mishap and discover a place like this . p. 8 IRA That 's true . CHARLES Sure . IRA You speaking of England reminded me of something . ( He goes to front door and extracts a large brass key and holds it out to CHARLES . ) Throw this as far as you can . Your arm 's better than mine . CHARLES Well , I 'm no Satchel Paige , but  --   --  You mean outside ? IRA Right . I remember reading somewhere , they had this old custom in England , I think it was England , where they threw away the key the day they opened a new hotel . CHARLES I remember . ( They move to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw it ? IRA Suit yourself . CHARLES Let 's see now . Doctor Graeff 's house there . If I throw it over his roof . That 's a pretty good throw . IRA Better than I could do . Charles goes out , winds up and throws , while IRA stands in the doorway watching . CHARLES comes back in the doorway . IRA Let 's get inside , Charles . That 's a very thin jacket you 're wearing . They close the door and amble slowly to the bar , thinking their thoughts . p. 9 CHARLES ( as they amble ) : Oh , I 'm use to being out in all kinds of weather . Tropical hurricanes . I been in them . And arctic blizzards . Well , subarctic . I never was in any those expeditions where they ended up eating the dogs . Mr. Studebaker . That little ceremony , throwing the key ? IRA Yes ? CHARLES That means we 're open for business . IRA The Farmers Hotel , Rockbottom , P A , is now officially open for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . I 'd like to buy the first drink under the new management . IRA I 'll buy the drink , Charles . CHARLES That 's giving . I 'd like to buy the first drink . I 'll buy you a drink and me a drink with this little dollar bill , then you can have it framed and hung up there over the cash register . IRA I kinda like that . Do you want to ring it up ? CHARLES No , sir . I want you to ring it up . I 'll sign my name on it , and what 's the date , and you can have it framed . IRA ( going behind the bar ) : Well , what 'll it be ? CHARLES A shot of bourbon , please . Water for a chaser . Have something yourself . p. 10 IRA Thanks , I will . Take a bourbon myself . ( Pours them . ) CHARLES ( raising his glass ) : Success to the Farmers Hotel ! IRA ( returning the toast ) : And may you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink ) : I 'll just write my name on the dollar bill , then I better start swinging the old snow shovel . ( He signs the bill . ) IRA You got a pair of arctics ? CHARLES Oh , yes . I come fully prepared . I know this Pennsylvania weather . Got the shovel and the arctics in that closet-under the stairs . They move to the lobby where CHARLES takes out the arctics and snow shovel and sits down to put on the arctics . IRA stands watching him , with a cigar in his hand . IRA Bundle up good and warm now , Charles . CHARLES Yes sir . IRA And do n't try to do too much . You know , they say shovelling snow is one of the hardest things on a man 's heart . CHARLES For some men . The ones that do n't do any physical work but one day of the year , the day it snows . There we are . Now which coat will I put on ? My old mackinaw . For shovelling snow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHARLES My old sealskin cap . IRA Have n't seen one of those in years . CHARLES Given to me by an employer I was coachman for . Very well-to-do gentleman in Dutchess County , York State . IRA Well , take it easy , now , Charles . CHARLES I 'll start around by the side entrance and work my way to the front door . He goes through the bar to door at Left , followed by IRA , and exits . IRA is lighting his cigar as a man in an old-fashioned well-made ulster enters the lobby by the double doors . He is J. HENRY GRAEFF , M.D. DR . GRAEFF ( calling out ) : Hey , there ! Ira ? Anybody home in this crazy place ? IRA ( starting toward lobby ) : Who 's that ? DR . GRAEFF Me . Henry Graeff . IRA ( in the lobby ) : Why , good evening , Henry . DR . GRAEFF I think I got something belongs to you , Ira . Very mystifying . Does this belong to you ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I suppose it does . HENRY You know damn well it does , Ira . The only other place this key 'd fit is the old Moravian Church over at Flour Mill . IRA That so ? HENRY That 's so , and you know it . IRA Have something to take the chill off . HENRY Later , maybe , after office hours . Right now I want to clear up this mystery , or you clear it up for me . I was sitting in my back office , trying to bring my records up to date for the young fellow that does my bookkeeping . I have this young fellow come down from Allentown and does the real bookkeeping , but I 'm supposed to keep track of visits and office patients . Well sir , I was sitting there when all of a sudden , clang ! I heard something hit my car . I could n't imagine what it was , but I did n't like the sound of it . I only have the one car , and I do n't want anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I went out and took a look around and I happened to notice there was a hole in the snow on the hood , then down the side of the hood was this line through the snow , and there lying there on the running board was this key . I looked at it for a minute and I knew right away where it came from , but how did it get there . Now then , how did it get there ? p. 13 IRA Well , I hope it did n't do your car any harm . HENRY Do n't worry about the car . Worry about me . I 'm a practical man . I do n't believe keys just drop down on my sedan . IRA I can easily explain it . I threw it there . HENRY You threw it there . Well , I suppose you think that makes everything clear . IRA There 's an old English custom they used to do when they opened up a new inn . They 'd throw the key away , signifying that the inn would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people thought you were crazy when you took over this place . And now I know you 're crazy . What else are you thinking of throwing away ? IRA Nothing . Nothing else . HENRY Just money , and brass keys , eh ? That 's all , eh , Ira ? IRA ' T 's all . HENRY Ira , you do n't think I ought to have you locked up for your own good ? I could go to old Judge Laubenstein and get a court order and have you put away some place where they put harmless cases like you . They 'd treat you kindly . You could pretend it was a hotel , and you were running it . They 'd humour you . IRA Well , there 's only one thing wrong with that idea , Henry . p. 14 HENRY What 's that , Ira ? IRA Well , if you went into court to get an order to have me put in the crazy-house , old Judge Laubenstein , he 's a pretty wise old fellow . I think Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to lead you away . All I 'm doing here , I 'm trying to have a little fun running a country hotel in my old home town , but you go into court  --  I do n't know , Henry . The judge 'd be liable to think to himself : this man 's going around treating sick people . He 's dangerous . No , Henry , I 'd stay out of court if I were you . HENRY Suit yourself , Ira . I only made the offer in a kindly spirit . But if you 're thinking of throwing any more things , be careful you do n't hit Elsie Zumbach 's property . You know Elsie does n't think you 're harmless . She thinks you want to open up a whore house , that 's what she thinks this place 'll turn out to be . Of course maybe Elsie 's right . Still too early to tell . IRA If that 's what it 's going to be , I think I can guess who 'd be the first customer . HENRY Hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give me back the key . If you want to get rid of it I 'll drop it in Schaeffer 's Dam . IRA Thanks , Henry . And say , do n't say anything about this to Charles , my coloured fellow . p. 15 HENRY Oh , I wo n't say anything to Charles . I 'm counting on him to shovel the snow in front of my place , and I do n't want him to think we 're all crazy around here . HENRY , during the preceding speech , is standing with the door open a little . IRA Listen , come in or go out , but do n't stand there with that door open . HENRY I think you 're getting a customer . IRA Well , close the door , or you 'll be getting a patient . HENRY Yep . Looks like a customer . IRA Close the God damn door ! HENRY , smiling , goes , closing the door behind him , but it is immediately reopened by a tall man in a polo coat and fox-hunting habit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , wo n't you ? IRA Excuse me , I was barking at my friend . POMFRET I know . Have you got a telephone booth here ? IRA Yes , there 's the booth over there , but I 'm not sure it 's connected . Just had it put in yesterday and I have n't tried it yet . POMFRET I 'll give it a try for you . Will you give me a dollar in silver , please ? p. 16 IRA ( taking out a snap purse ) : Surely . Twenty-five , fifty , you 'll need some nickels and dimes . Sixty , seventy , eighty , eighty-five , ninety , ninety-five , one dollar . To Philadelphia is thirty-five cents . POMFRET ( suspiciously ) : What makes you think I 'm calling Philadelphia ? A handsome woman , also in hunting habit , enters on this speech and goes directly to the stove . IRA Well , just a guess . I 'd say you look more like Philadelphia people . The man and woman exchange quick glances . POMFRET Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies ' room ? IRA Just up those stairs and to the right . To the left , I mean . She exits . IRA ( to the foxhunter ) : You wish the imported or the domestic ? POMFRET The imported . IRA Do you wish it like a highball , or in one of those small brandy glasses ? ( He holds up thumb and forefinger . ) POMFRET ( reproducing the gesture ) : In one of those small brandy glasses , and you can bring me mine here in the booth , if you do n't mind . p. 17 IRA Another thing about that telephone . It 's a different system here . You do n't put the money in till the operator tells you to . In other words , not like city phones where you deposit the coin first . Here you wait till the operator speaks to you first and then you give her the number you want and she 'll tell you how much to deposit . You know what I mean ? POMFRET I think I can manage that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise you lose whatever you put in . That 's the system they have around this part of the country . I understand they 're changing it , but it wo n't be put through for quite a while . POMFRET It may be put through before I put through this call . He closes booth door . IRA goes to bar , and with noticeable unfamiliarity finds the brandy ponies , the imported brandy , and pours two drinks , and takes one back to the lobby and taps on door of booth and hands the drink to the FOXHUNTER , who takes it and quickly closes the door . IRA returns to the place behind the bar , awaiting the reappearance of the LADY , which occurs almost immediately . She gives a passing glance at the booth , but proceeds to the bar . IRA Your husband 's still talking . LADY I see he is. p. 18 IRA Your brandy . You want something by way of a chaser ? A glass of water ? LADY A glass of water , fine . And while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? IRA With brandy ? LADY ( handing him a silver pint flask ) : Mm-hmm . The imported . IRA A pleasure . Now let me see , a funnel . Funnel , funnel , funnel . Here we are . Uh-uh . This spout wo n't fit into the mouth of your flask . But I 'm pretty sure Mrs. Fenstermacher will have a smaller one . LADY Oh , I would n't be too sure . IRA Do you know Mrs.  --   --  Oh , you 're kidding me . LADY A little . IRA Mrs. Fenstermacher does the cooking . I do n't want to call her the cook . She would n't like that much . More of a sort of partner . I 'll be right back . He comes out from behind the bar and crosses to the dining-room door at Right and exits . The LADY pours another brandy , and the FOXHUNTER enters the bar . POMFRET Caught in the act . LADY God . Do n't say that . p. 19 POMFRET What ? Oh , I see what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's expected back in a half to three-quarters of an hour . ( He puts his polo coat on a chair . ) LADY Who did you talk to , the butler ? POMFRET Yes , I guess so . It sounded like a butler . LADY Did he sound English , or Irish ? POMFRET Good Lord , I do n't know . He could have been English , or , he could have been Irish . It was a servant . LADY Oh , you ascertained that ? POMFRET Sure I ascertained it . What difference does it make whether he was English or Irish ? LADY If he was English it was the butler . I do n't trust him . If it was the Irishman , he 's the chauffeur and a friend of mine . Patrick would lie for me . Walter , the Englishman , he might tell a lie , but in such a way that you 'd know he was lying . POMFRET Well , we can try her again in a few minutes . Give us a kiss . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately . They stop embracing before IRA re-enters the bar . p. 20 IRA One of these ought to do the job . LADY I helped myself to another brandy while you were in the kitchen . IRA That 's all right . Mister , you ready for another ? POMFRET I think I 'd like something to eat . How about it , do you serve sandwiches ? LADY Sure . Mrs. Fenstermacher . POMFRET What ? LADY Mrs. Fenstermacher does the cooking here . IRA That 's correct , and you can take my word for it , anything prepared by Mrs. Fenstermacher , you 'll never forget it . That 's why if I might make a suggestion to you folks . POMFRET What 's the suggestion ? IRA My suggestion , unless you 're going to somebody 's for a regular dinner and you only want a little something to fill in , I suggest you eat one of Mrs. Fenstermacher 's dinners . I guarantee you you 'll never regret it . The LADY puts her coat on a chair . LADY I 'm afraid we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad . Mrs. Fenstermacher 's famous around here , but if you do n't have time , you do n't have time . What could I get you in the way of a sandwich ? At least take a steak sandwich . p. 21 LADY I 'll go for a steak sandwich , cut thin , though . POMFRET Make that two . IRA French fries come with it and a nice tomato salad . How does that sound ? POMFRET I 'll skip the potatoes and salad . LADY I think I 'll skip the potatoes , but I will have the salad , French dressing . And I 'm going to switch to a cocktail . POMFRET You are ? LADY I 'm going to have a Side Car . POMFRET A Side Car ? LADY Has brandy in it . IRA For that I 'll have to get Charles . I 've drunk every kind of cocktail , but mix them is different . Charles is the man to mix you a cocktail . I 'd only spoil it . POMFRET Well , will you get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car too . IRA goes out to fetch CHARLES and the man and woman are left alone . They seat themselves at one of the bar tables . Their manner is that of being strongly in love and beginning to like the Farmers Hotel . He touches her cheek and she touches his . LADY You 're beginning to need a shave. p. 22 POMFRET No wonder . Do you know what time I shaved this morning ? LADY No . What time did you ? POMFRET About six o'clock . LADY I was up at six , too . This must be Charles . CHARLES ( entering bar , removing coat , etc . ) : Good evening , ma'am . Sir . Not a very good day for hunting . LADY Good evening . No , it was n't . Do you know about hunting ? CHARLES A fair amount , a fair amount . I had one of my employers years ago , he had a private pack . My understanding , he gave it up in ' 29 , due to circumstances . I was always raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 17 . POMFRET Were you in the cavalry ? CHARLES No sir , I was n't . I had a kind of a strange career in the Army . I went overseas as a trombone player . I played trombone with Lieutenant Jim Europe 's band , the 369th Infantry Band . I got a Purple Heart , and I got a dishonorable discharge , but I can vote or get a passport just the same as anybody . POMFRET That is quite a career . CHARLES ( going behind the bar ) : Mr. Studebaker says you wish a Side Car . p. 23 POMFRET Mr. Studebaker ? CHARLES Gentleman you been talking to . Owns this place . You like to know how I can vote and all , even with the dishonourable ? POMFRET By all means . CHARLES ( starting the cocktails ) : Well , with Lieutenant Jim Europe I was stationed in Paris . The summer of ' 18 I happen to get a parcel of socks and chocolate , steel shaving mirror was inside , a deck of playing cards . That parcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . The note enclosed said if I ever ran into their son I was to write and tell them all about it . Well , of course I knew the son very well as a boy , and he I knew was in the Fifth Marines . So I just happened to get a furlough from the band and through a staff officer I knew , a major , I asked this major if I could be his chauffeur , because I knew this major used a general 's Cadillac when he went up front , up behind the front lines on liaison . He was doing liaison with the French . That 's how it happened , how I got my Purple Heart . The medal , it did n't come till much later , ten years later , but the wound I got on the 13th day of September , 1918 , at St.-Mihiel , sitting in the driver 's seat of a Cadillac automobile . I got it in the leg and like to bled to death , but at that I was better off than my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same shrapnel hit me . Took off his whole head . I never did get to see the young man I went looking for . Never seen him to this day . I always meant to write to his mother , but by the time I got through my own troubles the war was over and everybody was back home , everybody that was gon na get there . p. 24 POMFRET Quite a story . CHARLES Taste these . I make a pretty good Side Car . LADY ( tasting ) : Fine . Perfect . CHARLES They 'll never get to tell all the stories happened in that war . That was some war . The Second was bigger and more global , but the First was more like an old-fashioned war . An officer could be sitting having his aperitif at a sidewalk caf , late in the afternoon . Mud on his boots . Why did n't he get the mud taken off his boots ? Because he was going right back to his aerodrome in fifteen minutes and they 'd only get muddy again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . POMFRET You told us about the Purple Heart . What about the dishonourable ? CHARLES That . Well , I went back to Lieutenant Jim Europe 's band after I got fixed up , and I guess I began to think I was John J. Pershing himself . Not making excuses for myself , but by the time I got back a lot of the boys were pretty uppity , so I got just as uppity as any of them . I decided it was time for me to light out for home . The war was over and I wanted to see my family . So I just went down to Brest and borrowed a pack and came home with a Pioneer outfit . I was all the way to New York Harbour before they caught up with me , one advantage of being a Negro in the midst of two thousand other Negroes . Then there was a lot of red tape , court martial and all that , and depriving me of my citizenship . But a former employer of mine took an interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed Woodrow Wilson . I never even set foot in Leavenworth. p. 25 POMFRET Probably because you 'd been wounded , do n't you think ? CHARLES Exactly . There 's men I know , knew in the band , they never did come back . When it came time to come home in ' 19 they said to themselves : " Why should I go home ? I never had it so good at home . " Some of them married and settled down with the French natives , and now I guess they got grandchildren , for all I know . LADY Do n't you ever hear from them ? CHARLES I do n't want to hear from them . I sowed a few wild oats in Paris . I was a young fellow , and wartime . But I had a family , my wife and in those days the one son . I wanted to get home with my family and make a future . LADY And that 's what you did ? CHARLES Yes , ma'am , that 's what I did . Here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want another ? POMFRET You know we do . LADY ( lightly ) : Yes , I guess we do . POMFRET We 're going to have to gulp it down , because here 's our food . IRA enters , carrying a tray , and presently is assisted in serving by CHARLES . The FOXHUNTER and the LADY become silent as the food is placed before them and CHARLES , unbeknownst to them , signals IRA to go out to the lobby with him . p. 26 CHARLES ( in the lobby ) : I think they want to be by themselves . IRA Did they give you the hint ? CHARLES No , but I can tell . IRA Leave it to you , Charles . CHARLES ( going to swinging door ) : If you want anything just call out . I 'll be in here . POMFRET We 're fine , thanks . LADY Charles is being tactful . POMFRET Why should he be tactful ? LADY They 're both being tactful . They suspect illicit romance . POMFRET I do n't believe that for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Charles does . POMFRET Well , what if they do ? LADY Oh , I 'm not worried . It 's rather fun . At least now , this minute . It may not be later , but it is now . I wish we could stay here , all night . POMFRET Well , we can forget about that right this minute . LADY Oh , I know , but it would be nice . POMFRET ( abruptly ) : Say , have you any money ? p. 27 LADY Not a cent . POMFRET It just occurred to me . I do n't think I have enough to pay this bill . I know I have n't . LADY We can always cash a cheque . I 'm sure Mr. Studebaker trusts us . POMFRET Not if he suspects illicit love . LADY Illicit romance . POMFRET ( calling out ) : Charles ! CHARLES ( appearing not too quickly ) : Yes sir . POMFRET Would you ask Mr. Studebaker to come here , please . CHARLES ( exiting ) : Yes sir . POMFRET ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll handle this whole thing . IRA ( appearing ) : Yes sir ? What can I do for you ? I can recommend all our pies , all home made right here in our own kitchen , if you care for pie . POMFRET Nothing more to eat , thanks , but I have a favour to ask you . IRA That 's what we 're here for . POMFRET Wait till you hear what it is , first . You might not be too eager . p. 28 IRA You mean you want to cash a cheque ? POMFRET That 's right . IRA How much ? POMFRET Fifty dollars ? IRA Fifty is all right . Do you have your own cheque , or do you want a blank ? POMFRET No , no cheque , and no identification . But I 'll tell you what I 'll do . ( Undoing his wrist-watch ) : You can take my word for it , this watch is worth a damned sight more than fifty dollars , or ten times fifty dollars . IRA ( smiling ) : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your watch be to me ? If you were n't honest the watch could belong to some other person , so if you were n't good for the cheque , all I 'd get was stolen goods . POMFRET I must have an honest face . LADY I never thought so . POMFRET No , you never thought so , but apparently Mr. Studebaker does . Mr. Studebaker , my name is Pomfret , and I live in New York . The H. P. on the back of this watch , that of course does n't prove anything , but those are my initials . Howard Pomfret . That 's the closest I have to identification . I left my wallet in my other clothes , back at  --  where I changed . Quite a few miles from here . p. 29 LADY Is n't there a label inside your  --   --  POMFRET Yes , that 's right . Here 's my name on this label . IRA Mr. Pomfrey , you 're the one that 's doing all the talking about identification , not me . I did n't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , but I was in another business for over thirty years and I did n't go broke , and most of my business had to be done on credit . I 'll get you a blank cheque and a pen . If you want to make it for a hundred , that 's all right too . ( He keeps talking while getting the blank cheque from the desk . ) If I did n't know how to size a person up I could have easily gone broke the first year I was in business . POMFRET I have something else to tell you , quite candidly . IRA What 's that ? POMFRET Well , if you 're doing this for good will  --  you know I may never get back this way again . IRA Why , I do n't expect to see you again , you or the lady . POMFRET You do n't ? Why not ? LADY Yes , why ? IRA Well , am I right ? You folks do n't expect to come here again . p. 30 LADY Unfortunately , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person credit for some intuitions . LADY You mean we 're not married . IRA ( wishing this were over ) : At first I thought you were . LADY What made you change your mind ? We did n't have that married look ? IRA I guess that 's it . You two people , you 're not kids . LADY Say no more , Mr. Studebaker . Our guilt is written on our faces . IRA I did n't say anything about guilt . POMFRET ( to her ) : I think you may be embarrassing Mr. Studebaker . IRA ( quickly ) : Or I did n't say I was embarrassed , either . He takes the cheque , which POMFRET has been filling out , stuffs it in his vest pocket , and from his wallet takes five ten-dollar bills and hands them to POMFRET . POMFRET Thank you very much , Mr. Studebaker . We were just about out of everything , money , and gas . Our tank is down to E for Empty . IRA ( frowning ) : How far do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me where you 're going , but how far in miles ? p. 31 POMFRET How far would you say , Sweetie ? LADY Lordy , I do n't know . We took so many wrong turns , and I 've never been in this part of the state before . IRA Judging by your clothes you must be from somewhere near the Main Line . LADY In that general direction . A little to the west . IRA I was in business in Philadelphia before I bought here . I never lived on the Main Line , but we used to go out there on drives . I always had to live in the city because of my business . LADY And what was your business , may I ask ? IRA Wholesale fruit and produce I was in . LADY Then you may have had business dealings with some of my family . You had to see people that owned orchards , did n't you ? IRA Personally very seldom , unless they had a big orchard . The ones with the big orchards , sometimes it was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . If you have some relation that owned one of the big orchards , maybe I knew him . But only in a business way , not socially . Half of my life I got up at four o'clock in the morning , that 's the way our business works . LADY ( getting bored ) : Fascinating . I know I 'd love to hear about it some time , but I suppose I never will . p. 32 IRA ( catching on ) : No , I do n't guess you ever will . LADY ( immediately repentant ) : I 'm sorry , Mr. Studebaker . I did n't mean to be rude . IRA Well  --  that 's all right . I guess you 're worried . LADY I am . POMFRET To get back to our original discussion , or one of our original discussions . IRA ( ignoring him ) : Worrying wo n't get you home , ma'am . Let Mr. Pomfrey and I do the worrying . POMFRET That 's it , and I am doing some of the worrying . IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sits down . ) The first thing is the gazzoline . Across the road over there , maybe you noticed a gazzoline pump , but a pump locked up is as good as no pump at all . I know this friend of mine that owns the grodge garage . Dewey Kemp . I 'll try to get in touch with him . He goes out to the phone booth , during which LADY puts watch back on POMFRET 'S wrist and kisses his hand . IRA returns . IRA ( shaking his head ) : Dewey Kemp , the fellow that owns the grodge , sometimes when he 's working on one of his inventions he wo n't answer the phone . Dewey 's an inventor , working on some patent and hates to be interrupted . And tonight I guess he figures it 's a good night to lock up and go home , work on the patent . p. 33 POMFRET A garage ought to be like a hotel . If you were n't open we 'd most likely be stuck in the snow . IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Original Mister Independent , and you got to admire him for it . POMFRET You admire him , then . IRA Well , you 're pretty independent yourself , Mr. Pomfrey , and I admire that . POMFRET Mr. Studebaker , if you 'll take another look at that cheque you so kindly cashed , look at the signature . My name is Pomfret . Pomfret . Howard Pom-fret , not Pom-free . It 's not a hard name . LADY Howard , let 's you and I stop being surly with this really nice man . He 's trying to help us , and without his help we may be in a very , very , very nasty little jam . Will you get that through your arrogant skull ? POMFRET All right , you handle it . LADY All right , I will . Mr. Studebaker , it 's absolutely necessary that we get back to my house before at the latest eleven or eleven-thirty tonight . IRA That you can easily do , as far as distance is concerned . It depends on the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we go ? p. 34 IRA ( rubbing his belly ) : Well , the way I 'd go would be take that road that intersects us here at the corner , and head for Wheelwright . Mind now , it 's a country road and maybe it 's all drifted over , but we can find out if it 's passable , and if it is , that 's your road . At Wheelwright you 'll hit 335 , and if you stay on 335 that 'll end you up in Norristown . LADY It 's as simple as that ? I wonder where we went wrong . POMFRET I could answer that question , but it would n't have anything to do with highways . LADY ( not annoyed , but continuing ) : And if the road is n't clear to Wheelwright , then which way ? IRA Then you 'll have to go east on the Dieglersville road , but not all the way in to Dieglersville . You turn right about half a mile before Dieglersville and that puts you on the road marked Doylestown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LADY Oh . Three-thirty-five ! IRA That 's correct . LADY Will you write it down , please ? Both ways ? IRA ( getting some paper ) : I 'll write the directions down and draw you a rough map . I 'll just put down the principal places to look out for , because once you 're on 335 you 're headed home . ( Takes out matching pen and pencil set . ) These were a present from my drivers and helpers when I sold out to my partner . I always like to show them off . I kind of expected a little something from the people in the office , and they gave me a cigar humidor I have up in my room . But from the drivers and helpers , they used to give me a lot of trouble . They went out on strike on me three times and cost me a lot of money . But the day before I was retiring , leaving for good , they all came in my office and presented me with this pen and pencil set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there for a minute I could n't think of anything to say . And they could n't either . Then O'Leary , the big Irish fellow that was supposed to make the presentation speech , he and I started talking all at once . p. 35 LADY What did O'Leary say ? I 'd like to hear . IRA ( modestly ) : Oh , I do n't know . It was so flattering . LADY I 'll bet it was no more than you deserved , Mr. Studebaker . IRA ( with a delighted grin ) : That 's about what O'Leary said , ma'am . That 's just about what O'Leary said . Well , now , this is n't getting you to Norristown . I 'll go and find out about the roads . Would you care for a little libation ? LADY I do n't think so , thanks . IRA Mr. Pomfret ? POMFRET Not at the moment , thanks . Ira exits to lobby , and puts on overcoat , muffler , arctics and gunning cap with earlaps . IRA ( to the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemp lives , I might find him home . POMFRET I 'll go with you . IRA No , no , you stay here and keep the lady company . He exits . LADY ( after a pause ) : How old would you say he was ? POMFRET Oh , I do n't know . He said he was in the grocery business  --  how long ? I 'd say he was around fifty-eight . He 's kind of a nice old bird . p. 36 LADY You know something ? He 's about the same age as Alex . POMFRET Your Alex ? Alex Paul ? LADY I 'll bet there is n't more than a year or two 's difference in their ages . In other words , I 'm married to a man about the same age as Mr. Studebaker . I 'm getting on . POMFRET Oh , hell , you married young and you married a guy a hell of a lot older than you . LADY The fact remains . You see , the difference between this man and Alex , Alex is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex when he was n't sunburned ? POMFRET Never , I guess . LADY And Alex , no lines in his face , or practically none . Good food , the outdoor life , no worries . POMFRET No worries ? LADY Not so far . The only thing that 'll bother him is if people say I just nipped off with you . POMFRET But you 're not just nipping off with me , Martha . MARTHA If we get away with this little excursion I think I can handle it so he 'll give me the divorce . POMFRET And Esther . MARTHA And Esther . I 'd live with you openly , but he 'd take Esther away from me , and I do n't even want him to share her . I do n't want him to have anything to do with bringing her up . I 've fought it all her life and I do n't want to see her spoiled now , and this 'd be just the time , too , just the time he could spoil her . You do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat bitterly ) : No , but I 'd be willing to learn . MARTHA I saw it happen . A girl I know tried to bring up not one but two daughters with that kind of money . What happened ? She and her husband parted company and he did n't get custody , but he began it very subtly , loads of little presents , then bigger presents , trips abroad , 21 , El Morocco . Well , one of those girls is only a year older than Esther , but she 's pregnant and getting a divorce . The older sister , twenty-three years old , she 's already divorced and living with an actor that has a wife and a couple of children . That 's what the father did with his God damn money . And they began as wonderful kids , lovely . POMFRET And what about the mother ? MARTHA A drunk , a falling-down , hopeless alcoholic . POMFRET Is she married again ? MARTHA Heavens no . All puffed out , lost every vestige of her looks , plays around with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? Do I know her ? MARTHA Kitty George . I guess you 've probably met her . POMFRET I saw her last week at a dinner party . I hardly recognized her . p. 38 MARTHA It could happen to me . POMFRET Not to you , Martha . MARTHA It might . It could . Nobody ever thought it could happen to Kitty , either . But it did , it did . So far we 're not actually in trouble , serious trouble . If we get through to Eleanor she 'll cover up for me . I 'll tell her to call Alex and say I had one too many this afternoon , taking a little nap at her house , maybe spending the night . Alex will believe anything Eleanor says . As a matter of fact , Eleanor is his favourite cousin . POMFRET I did n't realize that . MARTHA They 're all related . POMFRET Wo n't he want to go over to Eleanor 's and take you home ? MARTHA He 'll want to , but she 'll take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Charles , I think I 'd like a Scotch and plain water , please . MARTHA ( rising ) : While I use the telephone . He hands her coins and she goes to booth . CHARLES ( serving drink and looking at dishes ) : Nothing wrong with the meat , I hope . p. 39 POMFRET No , we just were n't as hungry as we thought . CHARLES Because Mrs. Fenstermacher , she do n't like to see anything left on the plate . You want me to warm up the rest of Madam 's sandwich ? POMFRET I do n't think so , thanks . You can take it away . CHARLES Hmm . Well , I 'll just tell Mrs. Fenstermacher you had those sweet cocktails , took your appetites away . POMFRET More or less the truth . CHARLES Yes sir , more or less . POMFRET Hmm ? CHARLES I imagine , worrying about getting home , that would take some of your appetite away . POMFRET Oh , yes . CHARLES Did you take notice to where Mr. Studebaker went ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and rouse up the man that owns the garage . CHARLES Mr. Kemp ? I could have told him that . Mr. Kemp drove up to Allentown this morning . He wanted to get some tools or something for his invention . He 's an inventor , working on some invention . POMFRET How the hell can he afford to run a garage that way ? p. 40 CHARLES Afford to ? Mister  --   --  POMFRET Pomfret 's the name . P. o. m. f. r. e. t . CHARLES Oh , the same as the prep school . POMFRET That 's right . CHARLES I had one of my employers sent his son there . He did n't do very well . You ? ( Implying " You related ? " ) POMFRET No connection . CHARLES It 's a good school . But you asked me how could Mr. Dewey Kemp afford to run his garage that way ? POMFRET Yes . CHARLES Around these parts whenever you see a man living in one of these little villages like Rockbottom , or Wheelwright , or Flour Mill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamlets , you can be doggone sure the man made his little pile . He 's living retired . If he 's in business , he 's living semi-retired , do n't have to worry about if the business makes money . Just something to keep him occupied . You take Mr. Studebaker , a very well-to-do man . POMFRET I understand . CHARLES All this around here is farming country . Mostly the men that live in the villages , they 're retired farmers . p. 41 POMFRET I see . MARTHA ( returning ) : Charles , I think I 'll have a Scotch and soda , please . POMFRET What 's the story ? MARTHA ( with a fast look at CHARLES ) : Well , good , and bad . CHARLES serves her drink and tactfully goes to lobby . POMFRET Let 's hear the bad first . MARTHA Alex called Eleanor two or three hours ago and she was out . She called him back to find out what he wanted and he said he was worried about me . He said I had n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio about a blizzard . It 's not snowing badly down there , but it 's snowing . Well , Eleanor stalled . She said she was expecting me , which she was n't of course , dear Eleanor . And she said she heard me tell somebody I was going to their house for a cocktail , so he was n't to worry about me . She made a little joke of it . She told Alex I might have had two cocktails , but anyway . He believed her , but just as a precautionary measure he was going to call the police and have them keep their eye out for the station wagon . POMFRET Oh , God . The cops . MARTHA The cops . The good part is : she 's calling Alex now and telling him I 'm at her house , taking a bath and then a nap . Nothing to worry about . She 's telling him that she 's going to try to persuade me to spend the night . p. 42 POMFRET Pretty shaky . And what did you tell Eleanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months that I 'm in love with you . ( She laughs a little . ) POMFRET What 's funny ? MARTHA Eleanor . She has a good dirty mind . She said we could n't have had much fun if we were both in riding breeches . POMFRET Little does  --   --  MARTHA ( putting her hand over his lips ) : Never mind , now . This would have been a wonderful place . I 'd like to spend a weekend here , would n't you ? POMFRET Yes . Just about this time of year . Have the maid come in and close the window and serve us breakfast . MARTHA Not in bed , though . I do n't like breakfast in bed . POMFRET No , but a cup of coffee in bed . MARTHA That 'd be all right . Then breakfast in our dressing-gowns . POMFRET Then we 'd decide what to do that day . Go for a walk and see the sights . MARTHA I do n't imagine that 'd take very long , here . POMFRET I would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hay . p. 43 MARTHA Are n't you exaggerating your prowess ? We just got up , and after the night before POMFRET You may be right . I need a little more rest . We could both rest . Maybe no stroll . Just back to bed after breakfast and rest till lunch . MARTHA Lunch in our room ? POMFRET Sure . Spend the whole week-end in our room . MARTHA Have you ever done that ? POMFRET Yes , in Atlantic City . MARTHA You did n't have to answer so quickly . You might have pretended to give it a moment 's thought . POMFRET After a moment 's thought , yes , in Atlantic City , I think it was , or Coney Island , it might have been . Or maybe it was the Ritz Hotel in Paris . MARTHA It was Atlantic City , and you know it . And it was n't your wife . Who was it ? POMFRET Not my wife , and not anybody you know , and in fact , and this is God 's honest truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty . MARTHA That 's all you remember ? POMFRET Of a statistical nature . One other statistic . I gave her a hundred dollars . p. 44 MARTHA Oh , she was a whore . POMFRET No , she was n't a whore . She was kind of a girl around New York . A photographers ' model , well paid . I gave her the money because she cancelled a couple of jobs . MARTHA ( sarcastically ) : Did you take her picture ? POMFRET ( laughing ) : No , but frankly , I thought of it . She was quite a dish . MARTHA Yes , and she was probably used to posing for that kind of a picture , too . POMFRET Listen , girl , it was so long ago . I do n't want to remember her . I 'm with you . You 're my last love , my final love . MARTHA I am ? Why ? POMFRET Because you have a thin nose and sad eyes , and you 're the picture of health . MARTHA My eyes are sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I mean it you are . Your eyes were the first thing I ever noticed about you . MARTHA I do n't believe that . I remember the dress I was wearing , and in that dress nobody noticed my eyes . POMFRET I did , though . You were sitting down and you had your hands folded in your lap , and you were listening to Joe Lyle . Like this . ( He pantomimes. ) p. 45 MARTHA And you thought I had sad eyes . POMFRET I 've thought so ever since . Wisdom , tenderness and sympathy , and love . I did n't know who you were or anything about you , but I knew there was love there . MARTHA There is for you . There is n't for anyone else , but there is for you . POMFRET I know . I say that because we have n't got time to kid around with each other . MARTHA No , but thank God we do have the time we have got . POMFRET You 're worried , and I 'm worried for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . IRA , stomping , enters . MARTHA Get your breath first , Mr. Studebaker . IRA ( puffing ) : Certainly wish you folks could stay here for the night . MARTHA But you know ( Taps her ring finger and shakes her head . ) IRA ( taking a drink of water ) : Well , I do n't know about that . I guess if we looked back in the history of this old hotel , I would n't be surprised if we found one or two couples without benefit of clergy . ( Sitting with them ) : Be that as it may . Here 's my annual report to you folks . Went over to Dewey Kemp 's grodge . Nothing . He 's got a light going in his office , but not a sign of life . Next I took a walk down the other end of town where Dewey lives . First I banged on the door , front door . Then around the kitchen door . Even tried the cellar door . Scraped some snow off the cellar door and stomped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No answer . So  --  we do n't get any gazzoline from Mr. Dewey Kemp . However , on my way back I remembered . My tank is full . I filled her up the day before yesterday and did n't use the car since , so I could easily spare you ten-fifteen gallons . Ten gallons 'll surely take you to Norristown . My goodness , ten gallons ought a take you to  --  Baltimore , easy , in case you took a notion to drive to Baltimore . So what we can do , we can siphon out ten-fifteen gallons out of my car and you 're all set . p. 46 POMFRET ( to MARTHA ) : Is there a siphon in your station wagon ? A rubber hose ? MARTHA I doubt it . IRA Oh , we can always find something around here . I 'll bet Charles 'll have a siphon . Charles ! Oh , Char-rulls ! ( As CHARLES enters ) : The other thing , I spoke to one of the neighbours down the way . From what he tells me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between here and Dieglersville you have a steep hill , up one side and down the other and a pretty narrow road , so you better put your chains on . As to the Wheelwright road , just forget about that . Nobody 'll be coming or going that way for a couple days . POMFRET ( to MARTHA ) : Chains ? MARTHA No chains . I keep meaning to buy them . IRA Well , what 's that you have out there , what make ? POMFRET Buick station wagon . IRA I think my chains 'll fit it . Mine 's an Oldsmobile sedan , about the same year . Forty-nine ? MARTHA Forty-nine , that 's right . POMFRET I 'd have thought you 'd own a Studebaker . IRA On account of the name . Oh , I guess we must be related . They 're of course Indiana people . South Bend , Indiana , is where they ended up at , but I guess there must of been some connection farther back . I do n't remember whether my father said we were related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studebaker wagon and a Studebaker manure spreader when I lived on my parents ' farm . p. 47 POMFRET Well  --  if Charles will give me a hand I 'll steal some gas from your car and we can put on the chains . You know , there 's no use my even trying to thank you , Mr. Studebaker . MARTHA Try , though . POMFRET No , I wo n't even try . But you can . IRA Nobody has to thank me . I used to read those ads in the magazines , you know for the Statler hotels ? Like how they have the railroad people hold a train for somebody ? Or for instance the man that was making a speech at some other hotel and forgot his false teeth , but the Statler people sent one of their bellboys with the man 's plate . You know those ads . They make good reading . Well , that 's real hotel service , and we want to do as good . POMFRET Except that we 'll never be back . MARTHA We might be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then POMFRET and CHARLES go out . The silence continues , not awkwardly . MARTHA ( quietly but suddenly ) : I 'm a married woman with a young daughter . My husband is quite a few years older than I am and very rich . IRA ( letting her talk ) : Mm-hmm . p. 48 MARTHA My husband is essentially a good man , kind . But if he knew where I am now he would n't want me to see my daughter ever again . My daughter is sweet , quite pretty , and we get along fine . But if her father were to bring her up , without me , I do n't think it 'd be good for her . IRA Did you want to say anything more ? MARTHA No , I was just letting you know a little more about  --  me . Why ? IRA Well , just thinking . Your husband must be a good man . You ca n't even make yourself say anything against him . So you told me something about him , and about your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Have you children , Mr. Studebaker ? IRA No children . We lost the one , and then my wife had to have her tubes out . Does Mr. Pomfret have children ? MARTHA Two girls and a boy . The oldest girl 's the same age as my daughter , then a girl sixteen and a boy eleven or twelve . They 're all with their mother . He 's been divorced about three years . IRA On account of you . MARTHA No , I did n't know him then . IRA It 's a hell of a situation . p. 49 MARTHA Up at Yale . IRA What ? MARTHA Nothing . Tell me about this hotel , how you happened to buy it . I think we 're on safer ground there . IRA Yes . Well , I buried Irma on the tenth day of January , this year . She 'd been very poorly for a number of years . When she had her tubes out that was a long time ago , and modern science did n't know as much about cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then later the one breast removed , and I 'll tell you  --   --  What would you like me to call you ? MARTHA Well , my name is Mrs. Alexander Paul , my first name is Martha . Mrs. Paul or Martha , whichever comes easiest to you . IRA I like the name Martha . Well , Martha , so Irma lingered on , but it was a merciful thing for her the day she died . I 'd like to have a dollar for every time I was tempted to give her an overdose of some dope and end her suffering . But she always knew what I was thinking . She said to me more than once : " Ira , " she 'd say , with that sweet smile of hers on her face , " Ira , I know what you 're thinking , but do n't do it . I could do it myself , or we could do it together , but I 'm happy being with you , " she 'd say . " If we took our own lives , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're together and we 're sure of that . " Then I 'd be the one that would break down and cry like a baby , and all the time she was the one in pain . I buried her on the tenth day of January . p. 50 MARTHA Mm-hmm . IRA One thing the doctors did know , they knew when she was gon na die . They told me how long she had , and I began making plans to sell out to my partner . I told him , I said I did n't want to be in Philadelphia once she died . The memories . But then what did I do ? I brought Irma back here to Rockbottom , to the family plot . Both of us were from here , born here , courted here , married in that church across the way . Except for the one year I was at Normal and another year I was with the Reading we spent all our lives either here or in Philadelphia . We only ever lived in but three houses all our married life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried Irma there were one or two things had to be taken care of and I took a room over at the hotel in Dieglersville . This old place was an old place when I left here as a young fellow starting out , but I do n't know , I liked it , so I decided to look into the matter . Well , the bank was only too willing to let me take it off their hands and put my own money into it . My partner thought I was crazy with grief . He told me to take a rest and all , and when I told him I was going through with the deal he said if I went broke he 'd always offer me a job with the old business . I do n't know , maybe I 'll be back selling bananas in a year or two , but a man 's got ta keep himself occupied . And here I can remember Irma before she ever had any suffering . I remember her more as a young girl . p. 51 MARTHA Mm-hmm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I did . I signed up Marie Fenstermacher to do the cooking and act as sort of a housekeeper , and I hired Charles , Charles Mannering . Charles Moultrie Mannering . Mrs. Fenstermacher 's uncle owned this place once and I always knew her . Charles I hired through asking around among my customers , hotel and club men in Philadelphia . He was with one of the society clubs in the city . I can just sit and listen to Charles by the hour . I put over a hundred and twenty thousand of my own money in this place , the way you see it now . I tried to keep it as much like the old-time farmers ' hotel they used to have around here . You ought to take a look around if you had the time and see how this place is built . No nails in the timbering , not a nail , all pegs . Joists , some of them eighteen inches thick . MARTHA ( politely ) : Really ? IRA Oh , my . Ira Studebaker , you certainly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any person since Irma passed away . How about a nice cup of coffee ? You 're going to want a cup of coffee before you go , and Mr. Pomfret will too . I wish I had a Thermos bottle to send you away with , but I do n't think there 's one anywhere around . MARTHA I 'd love a cup of coffee . He goes out and she stands up and strolls about purposelessly , lighting a cigarette , and in a good mood . She returns to her chair . She is just seated when the lobby outer door opens and a LITTLE MAN enters , rather tentatively as to entrance , but not vocally . He looks about , sees no one , and calls out . p. 52 MAYO Tillers of the soil ! I say there , tillers of the soil ! My good host ! ( He proceeds to the bar and sees MARTHA .

MAYO Well , yes . We are of the theatre , one could say . Not Noel Coward , but we do take an occasional ad in Billboard . IRA appears with the additional coffee and sandwiches .

TRUCKER You wanted to hit me with the ketchup bottle . MARTHA I 'm sorry about that , but please go and see if you ca n't do something about the station wagon ? You want to go just as much as we do .

CONCHITA PICKWICK starts to cry and MARTHA gets up and puts a hand on her shoulder and the others try to comfort her. @x The scene is the same as Act One . The action is continuous . At rise the people are in the same positions as at end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby , in a pensive mood , rubbing his hands up and down his vest , frowning . He is concerned about his duties as boni-face , his responsibilities to these people . He comes to a decision , goes to the swinging door and beckons to MARTHA PAUL . IRA Uh  --  Mrs. Paul , could I see you a minute , please ? MARTHA ( rising ) : Of course . Excuse me . ( Joining IRA in lobby . ) IRA I want to get your advice on something . MARTHA Yes ? I 'm going to have to ask yours , too , but you go ahead . IRA No , you go ahead . Ladies first . MARTHA Well , I want to know first of all , how does that state policeman get around if the roads are blocked ? IRA Why , he has a jeep with snow tyres . MARTHA I see . You do n't think my station wagon ? IRA I 'm afraid not . p. 69 MARTHA But he seemed to think the big truck can get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 'd it be if we followed the truck ? The truck would make a path for us and we could follow it . IRA Well , of course you got ta take into consideration , the truck is much wider than your station wagon , a wider tread . MARTHA You know how important it is for me to get home tonight . IRA Yes . I know you ca n't help worrying , but I have this feeling something will turn up . I just have a feeling . MARTHA I wish I had . What were you going to ask me ? IRA Well , I was wondering  --  to take people 's minds off their troubles . I was thinking I 'd set up a buffet here , everybody could help themselves to something to eat , or we could serve it at the tables in the bar . MARTHA Hm-hmm . IRA First I thought of the dining-room . MARTHA It does seem the logical place . IRA It does . But if we have it in the bar , we 're closer to the liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their troubles is to get a few snorts in them . They wo n't eat much anyway . p. 70 MARTHA A party . IRA On the house , naturally . Everything on the house . MARTHA As far as that goes I 'd just as soon give the party  --  if you 'll take my cheque . IRA No , now this was my idea . MARTHA All right . IRA You 'll earn your supper . MARTHA How ? IRA Well , I was hoping you 'd act as the hostess . I 'm no good at those kind of things , but you , I imagine , you often give those big dinner parties . You know how to run things , make people feel at home . MARTHA But what about Mrs. Fenster  --  Fenster  --  IRA Mrs. Fenstermacher ? Oh , she 's worse than I am . She said when I hired her , Do n't count on me to do anything but the kitchen and housekeeping . I do n't want to have to talk to people , she said . Very shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IRA You 're different . She meant drummers . She still calls salesmen drummers . She do n't hold a very high opinion of salesmen . ( He goes to dining-room door and calls out ) : Maria ? Mrs. Fenstermacher ? MRS . FENSTERMACHER appears , a woman in her late fifties , wearing a big apron . She is stout , dignified . p. 71 MARIA Uh-huh ? IRA Maria , this is Mrs. Paul . Mrs. Paul , this is Mrs. Fenstermacher . MARTHA How do you do , Mrs. Fenstermacher ? MARIA Pleased to meet you . ( She tries not to be rude about MARTHA 'S attire , but can not keep her eyes off the breeches and boots . ) IRA Mrs. Paul and a friend of hers got lost and they 're miles from home . Also we got in the bar two young ladies and a man that also got lost and they 're on their way to Reading , only the roads are out to Reading . MARIA That 's how many ? MARTHA Two of us , and three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARIA Well , we 're in that business . The rooms are ready . We can take care of them all . IRA Before that I was thinking  --  You explain it , Mrs. Paul . MARTHA Mr. Studebaker thought we might have a buffet , here or in the bar . MARIA For how many ? MARTHA Yes , we did n't decide that , Mr. Studebaker. p. 72 IRA Everybody . MARIA How many is everybody ? MARTHA Yes , I think for instance we ought to invite the truck driver . IRA Everybody . Henry Graeff , the truck driver , Charles . MARIA Charles ate . He put nearly a whole roast chicken away . IRA Well , maybe he can put away another one . MARTHA No , not if this is to be buffet . MARIA She 's right . No roast chicken for buffet . I have a ham and I can give you cold roast beef from yesterday . ( To MARTHA ) : Was there something the matter with my steak ? MARTHA It was a beautiful steak , Mrs. Fenstermacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about getting home . MARIA ( subtly ) : I would be , too . MARTHA ( trying to overlook the crack ) : Well , now . Five of us already mentioned . Doctor Graeff is six . The truck driver is seven . Charles is eight , and you two makes ten . MARIA Henry Graeff is lucky if he eats a piece of bread and butter . He never eats . p. 73 IRA I 'll make up for him . MARIA You eat too much , that 's the difference . I had my supper . MARTHA But at least you 'll sit with us . Mr. Studebaker wants this to be a party . MARIA Mm . Well , I have enough to feed you . I 'll put on the sweet and sour relishes , some somer-sausage , bologna , liverwurst , I have this ham and the cold roast beef . Potato salad , I may run a little short there . I have a dozen pies on the window-sill cooling . Oh , they 're cool by this time . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup ? I have a bean soup on the range and soup 's good on a cold night . IRA Her soup 's a meal in itself . MARIA It 's a good thick soup , and with home-made bread , fresh butter . And I have a couple dozen hard-boiled eggs I could easily devil them . It wo n't be a regular meal , but it 'll be filling if you eat it all . MARTHA ( enthusiastically ) : It sounds wonderful . MARIA A good thick brown gravy for the cold roast beef . IRA We can put it in here and eat in the bar . MARIA I do n't understand why you want to eat in the bar . You put all that money in the dining-room . ( To MARTHA ) : He put all that money in the dining-room furniture and now he does n't want to use it . p. 74 MARTHA I think the idea is it 'd be more informal in the bar . MARIA Yes , and the liquor 's closer . Was that Henry Graeff 's idea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like Henry Graeff . IRA Well now , I 'll start setting up the table . I 'll get a couple planks and horses , get that little fellow to help me . ( To MARIA ) : This one little fellow , he looks like one of those barkers on the Midway during the Allentown Fair . MARIA When was I ever at the Midway at the Allentown Fair ? MARTHA What can I do to help you , Mrs. Fenstermacher ? MARIA Thanks , but I 'll be better off by myself . IRA She do n't like to have anybody in her kitchen . MARIA I 'll need help later , but not now . She exits and IRA and MARTHA enter the bar . IRA Folks , we 're going to have a party . MAYO Yummy !

MAYO ( to PICKWICKS ) : Eat up , Pixies , it 'll probly be your last good meal for a month . MARTHA Mr. Mayo , you 're delegated to help Mr. Studebaker set up the table . MAYO All right if he shows me how . PAULETTE What can we do ? CONCHITA Yes ? MARTHA At the moment , just make yourselves pretty . MAYO That 'll be a day 's work . PAULETTE Oh , you . CONCHITA You .

CONCHITA I 'll have one , please . MAYO Without even asking what it is ? PAULETTE I know what a Side Car is . It has brandy in it . CONCHITA See ? IRA There you are . Well , come on , young fellow . They exit through the dining-room door . PAULETTE ( to MARTHA , as they sit down ) : Were you in some horse show ? MARTHA Today ? No . I was fox-hunting . Mr. Pomfret and I. Are you interested in horses ? PAULETTE I stard out to be an equestrienne . MARTHA You did ? PAULETTE I was born with the John show . MARTHA I do n't think I know what that is . PAULETTE The John Robinson Circus . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps you heard of them ? p. 77 MARTHA I do n't think so . PAULETTE I thought you would because they were a famous act .

LaRue and LaRue . CONCHITA ( helpfully ) : Dancers . MARTHA ( faking ) : I think I did . CONCHITA A standard on the Sun time . They were my father and mother . Fatally injured in a train wreck outside of Fresno , California . DR . GRAEFF ( serving drinks , humorously ) : If you 'd care to hear about my background . I was born across the street and I 've never been any place else . How 's that for a dull life ? PAULETTE One of my parents was almost fatally injured in a train wreck near Lebanon , P A. My father . DR . GRAEFF That 's not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my aunt in Glendale , California , or I'da been killed . p. 78 MARTHA Heavens . PAULETTE My father lost the use of his right arm and we sued the railroad for over a hundred thousand dollars . CONCHITA You never told me that , Polly . PAULETTE But it happened . MARTHA Did you win ? PAULETTE Win what ? MARTHA The hundred thousand dollars . PAULETTE ( humorously ) : If we'da won that do you think I 'd be here ? No , all my father got was they paid the doctor bill and I think around six hundred dollars is all . MARTHA It does n't seem fair . PAULETTE My mother always said the lawyer we got , she was sure he was in the pay of the railroad company . MARTHA Was it the Reading Railway , do you remember ? PAULETTE I think it was , I 'm pretty sure it was , why ? MARTHA Then I 'm embarrassed , because  --  some of my family have stock in the Reading . PAULETTE ( quickly ) : Then I take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 79 MARTHA Thank you , Paulette . The only trouble is , your mother was probably right . HOWARD , JOE ROGG the truck driver , and CHARLES enter the lobby , look at their hands and exit to the washroom . DR . GRAEFF ( to PAULETTE ) : Did your father have to retire ? PAULETTE Retire ? DR . GRAEFF After he lost the use of his right arm . PAULETTE Well , he had to retire from the act . DR . GRAEFF Then what did he do ? PAULETTE Well , let me think a minute . For a while he played piano for the DeZito Brothers , the carnival show . GRAEFF ( making a gesture of playing the piano , especially broadly playing the treble part , none of which PAULETTE can see but which is seen by MARTHA ) : Indeed ? That 's interesting . PAULETTE Then after that he was in a ticket booth selling tickets . GRAEFF goes through a routine of selling tickets off a roll , making change , etc . DR .

I was raised by my grandmother till I was fourteen , then I ran away . I never thought about that . Maybe I ought to find out . HOWARD enters bar , goes to MARTHA and kisses her . HOWARD What goes on ? MARTHA A party . Mr. Studebaker 's having a party for the snow-bound . IRA Just a little get-together , take our minds off our troubles . The highway patrol says you ca n't get through . HOWARD Maybe not , but we 're going to make a try . The station wagon 's okay . The truck driver fixed it , and we 've got the chains on , gassed up , ready to roll . MARTHA The policeman said we ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is if the big truck will break the snow for you .

What will you have ? JOE ROGG Nuts , I 'll buy you a drink . DR . GRAEFF It does n't make any difference . The drinks are all on the house .

But you , with that big Diesel , you can probably get through , and I can follow you with the station wagon , in your tracks , so to speak . JOE ROGG ( thinking ) : Yeah . Uu-huh . What 's the favour ? HOWARD Just that we started fairly soon . JOE ROGG Yeah ? How soon is fairly soon ?

Seven hundred . Eight hundred . And not counting some small change in my pants pocket . Over eight hundred bucks . p. 83 MAYO That 's quite a bundle . JOE ROGG You 're God damn right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of cash to carry around . HOWARD That 's what I was thinking . JOE ROGG Somebody take it off me , you mean ? HOWARD Well , as What 's His Name said , it 's quite a bundle , and if somebody saw you with it they might want to try . In fact , I 'm tempted myself . JOE ROGG Aah , you old son of a bitch , you 're too honest . I can tell by lookin ' at you . HOWARD Well , thanks . That 's not an opinion generally shared , but I 'm glad you think I have an honest face . JOE ROGG You would n't have to stick me up or like that . Here , you want a hundred dollars ? Here . HOWARD Be careful , I might take you up on that . JOE ROGG What 's a hundred dollars to you ? I can tell a millionaire when I see one , and not only the horseback-riding outfit . I knew a joker in the army , and all of us wearing fatigues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by looking at him . ( Puts his hand on IRA 'S shoulder . ) This fellow , he got a little , but no millionaire . The Doc there , Christ he never saw a million , and the little fellow there , I bet he never had five hundred bucks at one time in his whole life . Am I right ? p. 84 DR . GRAEFF As far as I 'm concerned you are . IRA Mm-hmm . JOE ROGG But what about you , you old son of a bitch ? You 're not saying if I was right or wrong . HOWARD I guess my father may have had a million at one time or other . JOE ROGG That 's what I 'm saying . Your old man had it , and you blew it , you blew it on dames and booze . HOWARD I got rid of a fair sum , but not a million . JOE ROGG Maybe Charlie there , Charlie , you a millionaire ? CHARLES All in gilt-edged securities . JOE ROGG You 're all right , Charlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe . Only do n't go around offering us millionaires those C-notes . JOE ROGG Do n't you worry , I ai n't offering C-notes to anybody that 's liable to take them . HOWARD What if I 'd crossed you ? I could have crossed you , you know . JOE ROGG But I knew you would n't . ( Puts money back in pocket . ) You guys wonder how a guy pushing a truck , how he happens to go around with over eight hundred bucks in his pocket . p. 85 HOWARD Why , I thought you fellows made that much every week . JOE ROGG Aah , you old son of a bitch . We do all right , but no eight hundred a week . No , the way I got this dough . I bet . HOWARD You bet . The horses ? JOE ROGG The horses ? The horses is for chumps . Nobody ever beat the horses . I bet on football games . I got twenty or thirty bets going every Saturday . The garage where I work out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys that push trucks , they bet with me . MAYO You make book ? JOE ROGG I make bets . I do n't make no God damn book . I bet with guys and they know me . You might say I run a private betting establishment . HOWARD Is n't that dangerous ? JOE ROGG On account of the law ? HOWARD I was n't thinking so much of the law . JOE ROGG You mean I 'm muscling in ? You 're right . I am muscling in . I 'm muscling in on the syndicate . HOWARD That 's what I meant by dangerous . JOE ROGG Yeah , but I 'm pretty tough too . HOWARD Do you always know who 's going to win ? p. 86 JOE ROGG Pretty near always . HOWARD How 's Harvard going to do this Saturday ? JOE ROGG Harvard I can count on . Harvard always loses . MARTHA ( entering bar ) : Gentlemen , dinner is served . JOE ROGG ( putting his arm around HOWARD and nodding towards MARTHA ) : You son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this time . He kisses MARTHA , and the people begin the business of picking places to sit , helping themselves to plates and to food , with MARIA behind the tables , also CHARLES and IRA . After a certain amount of milling about MARTHA takes charge . IRA Mrs. Paul , will you take care of the seating arrangements ? MARTHA Well , let 's see . The table has room for twelve , and without Charles we 're nine . Nine means two men will have to sit side by side , somewhere . We 'll start at the head of the table , Mr. Studebaker . Then me , I 'm putting myself on your right . Mr. Mayo next to me . Howard , you next to Mr. Mayo , then Mrs. Fenstermacher at that end . On her right , the doctor . Next to the doctor Conchita , then Mister Rogg , and on his right Paulette. p. 87 IRA Perfect . Perfect . MARTHA Not quite perfect , but  --   --  DR . GRAEFF Works out fine , I think . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTHA speaks to IRA to get the conversational ball rolling . MARTHA Well , I think this is very pleasant . I 'm not only a guest at your first dinner , but I 've even had the honour of helping with your party . IRA Helping . Without you there would n't be any party . Attention now goes to ROGG and the PICKWICKS . PAULETTE Are you from this place ? JOE ROGG No , where you from ? PAULETTE New York . JOE ROGG New York City ? PAULETTE That 's right . JOE ROGG Is this here kid your sister ? She do n't look like you . PAULETTE We 're supposed to look a lot alike . We do an act together in show business . JOE ROGG Yeah ? What does he do ? The little fellow . MAYO ( overhearing ) : I 'm a weight lifter. p. 88 JOE ROGG You a weight lifter ? MAYO Military press . Snatch and grab . Sure . JOE ROGG How much can you lift ? MAYO I was only kidding . I could n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then what do you do ? Is he your pimp ? PAULETTE Lay off , now . Be nice . JOE ROGG Hell , if he can kid I can kid too . The moment of uneasiness passes , but not for ever , and with some reservations about the future the others eat and sip as the CURTAIN is lowered for the end of the scene . p. 89 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO As the CURTAIN rises on this scene which in time follows the preceding by an hour or so , the women are removing the last of the dishes , the men are seated , sprawling in some cases , full of food and with enough to drink to make them feel good , but no one is drunk , although JOE ROGG is not unaware of CONCHITA 'S walk as she carries out some dishes . MAYO Just right . Just right . I do n't even want another cuppa coffee . IRA ( going to bar ) : Cigars ? Who 'll have a cigar ? CHARLES ( rising from a chair ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : The  --  uh ? ( Implying the expensive cigars . ) IRA nods . CHARLES gets cigars and starts to pass them . CHARLES Wo n't find a cigar as good as this within fifty miles , gentlemen . DR . GRAEFF I can vouch for that . Ira , you know all the children I delivered in this community  --  I do n't mind getting up at four o'clock a.m. and so forth and so on , but the next day , usually it 's the next day , the proud poppa always forces some El Ropo on me . Or used to till I began telling them I did n't smoke . p. 90 JOE ROGG ( To MAYO ) : Do n't let it throw you there , little fellow . MAYO ( trying to be pleasant ) : Do n't worry about me . I smoked cigars when I was ten years old . O P B 's we used to call them . Other People 's Butts . Man 'd throw away a cigar and us kids grab it before it hit the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure did stunt your growth . MAYO Maybe . Something did . I got a brother over six feet tall . JOE ROGG Yeah , but how do you know he 's your brother ? DR . GRAEFF ( covering up ) : There are satisfactory explanations for those uh , differences in size . JOE ROGG If I was married and my wife  --   --  HOWARD How big was your father ? JOE ROGG My father ? I guess you 'd call him about medium height . HOWARD How big was your mother ? JOE ROGG Small . Only about  --   --  Come on , you old son of a bitch . You 're trying to trick me . Huh ? Trying to trick me ? HOWARD Right . p. 91 DR . GRAEFF As I say , there are satisfactory explanations for these discrepancies . CHARLES ( wisely ) : Mm-hmm . They can always be explained , especially where I come from originally . IRA ( puffing at his cigar ) : Charles , how about a little music ? CHARLES Sure , why not ? What on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRAEFF Do you play the trombone , Charles ? IRA Name something he does n't do . CHARLES I play a little trombone . DR . GRAEFF Slide , or valve ? I used to play valve in the Rockbottom Boys Band , forty , forty-two-or-three years ago . CHARLES Yes sir , I played a little slide when I was with Lieutenant Jim Europe 's band . That was in World War One . MARTHA enters , going to HOWARD 'S side . MARTHA Electric dish washer . As big as the Waldorf 's , I 'll bet . HOWARD We 're going to have some music . MARTHA We ca n't stay too long , you know . p. 92 CHARLES ( bringing trombone from behind bar ) : A few scales . My embouchure is a little out of practice . JOE ROGG Let 's have a crap game . HOWARD Let 's have the music . IRA No gambling , please . I like a friendly poker game , but anybody comes in and sees a dice game , it would n't look right . JOE ROGG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you heard what Mr. Studebaker said . ROGG starts to sulk as CHARLES plays " Getting Sentimental Over You " . JOE ROGG ( at the end of the solo ) : Play " Tiger Rag " . MAYO Oh , God no . JOE ROGG Who the hell asked you ? CHARLES plays " Tiger Rag " and all through it ROGG shouts " Hold that tiger " and bangs on the table . CHARLES Mr. Studebaker ? Any requests ? IRA Well  --  there 's one I always liked . A hymn . " Nearer My God to Thee . " JOE ROGG Jesus Christ ! MAYO Yeah , that 's the general idea . p. 93 HOWARD ( to MAYO ) : Do n't needle him , he 's liable to pop you . CHARLES plays the hymn while ROGG sings " Nero My Dog Has Fleas " . CHARLES The ladies have any preference ? Mrs. Fenstermacher ? MARIA Well  --  how about " There Are Smiles " ? MARTHA and MAYO sing two-part harmony to the song . PAULETTE Can you play  --  " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special key , ma'am ? MARTHA I have an idea . Why do n't the Pickwick Sisters sing a duet ? Do n't you usually sing together ? MAYO They sing together when they sign together . PAULETTE Get him . JOE ROGG That 's right . The dames sing . PAULETTE ( to CONCHITA ) : Will we ? CONCHITA Sure , I do n't care . I be glad to oblige . PAULETTE ( to MAYO ) : We do a number from the act ? What about a piano ? MAYO I got one in the car . ( To the others ) : Paulette 's a girl that one time she lost two bass drums . ( This is a sarcastic reference to her failure to notice a covered piano in the bar. ) p. 94 PAULETTE I never lost no bass drum , let alone two . CONCHITA No , you should n't say that , Jerry . HOWARD and GRAEFF push the piano to centre , taking off the cover as the PICKWICKS smooth their tight dresses and assume the professional manner . JERRY plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little song entitled Father Lost His Choon Gum on the Bedpost Overnight . PICKWICKS Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak . JERRY A little song , a little song entitled Father Cut Your Toenails You 're Tearing All the Sheets . ( To MARTHA ) : A class act , you know what I mean ? PICKWICKS Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak . MARTHA sits close to HOWARD , they unconsciously take hands . JERRY ( as though to a large audience ) : What this number did for Crosby  --  it 'll never do for us . Goes into " Mississippi Mud " , with the girls . Throughout the song ROGG bangs on the table , never on the beat . The three finish the song and MARTHA goes to them and shakes their hands . THE COMPANY Encore ! Encore ? p. 95 JERRY No encores , thanks , but I got a sneaking suspicion , something tells me we give Mrs. Paul a hand , how about it folks ? Applause . MARTHA I 'd love to sing . Uh  --  do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JERRY Sure  --  and maybe we 'll get better acoustics this time , you know what I mean . ( A reference to ROGG 'S banging on the table . ) MARTHA sings , and at the end JERRY says : JERRY How about the boys ? Wuddia say , lads ? DR . GRAEFF Sure , I 'll sing if the others will , but not by myself . JERRY There 's safety ( pronounced say-fifty ) in numbers , eh Doc ? DR . GRAEFF Right . Ira ? Mr. Pomfret . Uh  --  you . ( Meaning ROGG . ) JOE ROGG No singing for me . POMFRET Sure . IRA All right . " By the Old Mill Stream " ? JERRY ( as though to a large audience ) : Ladies and gentlemen , we are now in for our annual dry spell . " By the Old Mill Stream . " They sing , not well . p. 96 JERRY How about our friend the milkman . Got any songs , dances or witty sayings ? JOE ROGG No singin ' or like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of beer ? JERRY Now where would we find a bottle of beer in a saloon ? What a question . HOWARD ( cautioning him ) : Watch it , Mayo . CHARLES Here y'are . Shall I open it ? JOE ROGG No , no . That 's the trick . ( He puts the bottle to his mouth and removes the cap with his teeth , and there is polite applause . ) JOE ROGG Show you another trick . ( He lifts a bentwood chair by the left rear leg and holds it at arm 's length , shoulder high . ) CONCHITA I bet I could do that . JOE ROGG Yeah ? What 'll you bet ? A little kiss ? CONCHITA I 'll bet you fifty cents . JOE ROGG Who wants fifty cents ? I got plenty of money . Come on , bet the kiss . CONCHITA What if I win ? JOE ROGG Then I 'll give you fifty cents . p. 97 CONCHITA Aw-right . ( She tries , but is unable to lift the chair . ) CONCHITA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . CONCHITA Collect now . JOE ROGG Not me , not in front of everybody . I 'll collect any time I want to . You did n't say nothin ' when I was to collect . MARTHA But neither did you . She 's ready to pay off . She did n't bet a necking party . JOE ROGG Did anybody ask you for your advice ? Keep your nose out of it . MARTHA I volunteered my advice . Conchita , give the man his kiss and that will be that . CONCHITA goes slowly to ROGG , and when she is very close he grabs her and kisses her and mauls her . She struggles , POMFRET gets up and shoves ROGG hard , separating him from the girl . ROGG throws a punch at POMFRET but misses . JOE ROGG ( laughing ) : You wanta fight ? POMFRET Just leave her alone . MAYO He 's been a God damn nuisance all evening . MARTHA He has indeed . p. 98 DR . GRAEFF Ever since he came , I knew there 'd be trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time for you to go . JOE ROGG Who 's makin ' me go ? You ? You and who else ? CHARLES Me , maybe . JOE ROGG You ? You , for God 's sake . CHARLES Me . And this . ( He holds out his hand , in which lies a .38 automatic . ) This ai n't no water pistol . ROGG stands still , all the others hold their positions for a matter of seconds . JOE ROGG ( pointing to the pistol ) : If yizz did n't have that He goes to the lobby , picking up his cap and jacket , and goes out . PAULETTE Good riddance . Good riddance to bad rubbage . MARTHA ( to CONCHITA ) : Are you all right ? Did he hurt you ? It is noticeable that MARTHA is the only person who goes to CONCHITA . The mauling has embarrassed the other women , MARIA and PAULETTE . CONCHITA No , I guess not . I was scared more than anything . p. 99 IRA Half a mind to call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that I give a damn what happens to him , but you know he 's breaking that path for us , whether he wants to or not , and we 've got to be under way . MARTHA Yes . The conversation here is stiff , the gay mood has departed for ever with the violent action . MAYO Would you of shot him ? CHARLES Oh , I'da shot him . I 'm a firm believer in do n't point a gun if you are n't prepared to shoot . I'da shot him . MARTHA Thank the Lord you did n't have to . CHARLES I thank the Lord I did n't have to , ma'am , but that ai n't saying he wo n't never get shot . Or cut up . Or hit over the head . Something . People like him do n't live long . MARTHA Well  --  darling ? POMFRET Right . IRA I wish you folks did n't have to go , but I guess you have to . POMFRET Charles , you want to come out with me while I make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 100 MARTHA ( to PICKWICKS and MAYO ) : I hope we 'll run across you somewhere again . MAYO You probably wo n't . MARTHA I 'm not so sure . I go to night clubs , in New York . MAYO Lady , we do n't work many night clubs . Especially ones you 'd go to . PAULETTE You do n't have to tell her everything you know . MAYO Why not ? She 's a hip dame . Give her credit . She do n't think we travel all the way from New York to Reading P A just to do that lousy Mississippi Mud routine  --  do you ? MARTHA ( smiling ) : Well MAYO We only do that bit when we think maybe there 's cops in the house . MARTHA I see . MAYO Yeah . The Pickwicks work better with their clothes off . MARTHA Now , Mr. Mayo , I think you 're embarrassing the girls . CONCHITA Yeah , you do n't have to tell everything you know . MAYO She do n't mind , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen strip teases , if that 's what you mean . p. 101 MAYO That 's what I mean . MARIA Excuse me . ( Exits . ) PAULETTE See what you did , Mr. Big Mouth ? ( Starts to leave . ) MAYO Where you going ? PAULETTE To square it with her . Maybe we might have to spend the night here . Come on , Conchita . MAYO ( as they follow MARIA ) : You 're not kidding her , but go ahead . MARTHA Not that it 's any of my business . MAYO But what ? MARTHA But which one is your girl ? MAYO Well  --  Paulette and I , we been shacked up for five years . MARTHA Oh , you 're married to Paulette . MAYO I only said shacked up . No , she never got a divorce from her husband . Maybe just as well , or we would have been married . MARTHA What 's wrong with that ? MAYO Come on , you got eyes . MARTHA You 're in love with Conchita . MAYO Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102 MARTHA That 's really a problem . MAYO Yeah , it ai n't only the rich that have problems like that . The men return . POMFRET Okay . Runs like a watch . Turned over right away . All set , whenever you 're ready . IRA Charles , do we have a Thermos bottle around ? CHARLES No sir . IRA I was thinking of giving these good people a Thermos bottle full of coffee . POMFRET Oh , thanks very much , but there 'll be places on the way . IRA I suppose so . I 'd just feel better if you had a bottle of coffee to warm you up . CHARLES I could give them like a Mason jar or something on that order . POMFRET No thanks , we 'll be fine , thank you . Mr. Studebaker , this has been one of the pleasantest days of my life . MARTHA It certainly has . Really , I do n't know how to thank you . IRA Well , maybe I can look forward to your next visit ? How about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll see us. p. 103 POMFRET You certainly will . Good-bye , Doctor . DR . GRAEFF Good-bye and good luck , both of you . ( Shaking hands . ) POMFRET Mr. Mayo . MAYO Mr. Pomfret . ( Shaking hands . ) MARTHA I 'll go in and say good-bye to the others . Good-bye , Charles , and many , many thanks . ( She shakes hands with CHARLES . ) And Mr. Mayo , the same good luck to you . You know ? MAYO Likewise , ma'am . They shake hands , MARTHA exits . POMFRET exits through lobby door , followed by CHARLES , with IRA and GRAEFF going as far as the door with them and watching until MARTHA comes out of the kitchen . On an impulse she kisses IRA , then goes out to the car . IRA Well , Henry . DR . GRAEFF What 's that , Ira ? IRA Did you ever have a kiss from a lady with riding pants on ? DR . GRAEFF No , I can safely say I never have . IRA Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss from a lady ? p. 104 DR . GRAEFF At my age I 'm not gon na start telling professional secrets . IRA Well , there they go . ( IRA and GRAEFF wave , then they turn slowly and go to the bar . ) Care for a cigar , Henry ? DR . GRAEFF Do n't mind if I do , Ira . IRA ( to MAYO , who has waited in the bar ) : Mr. Mayo , care for a cigar ? MAYO No thanks . Uh , Mr. Studebaker . What are your rates here ? IRA Why , three dollars single , five double . MAYO Eight bucks . Do you give professional courtesy ? IRA Professional courtesy ? MAYO Some hotels give a reduction for theatrical people . IRA Oh .

( Chuckling . ) So far I 'm the only one spent a dollar here tonight , and I work here . IRA Well  --  even a bank you know , the first day in business they usually used to give away carnations . CHARLES We'da done better if we gave away carnations . I was wrong . That truck driver , he bought a couple drinks . With the profit on him we ought a be able to put in a couple solid gold bathtubs .

IRA makes a stab at putting things away  --  glasses , etc.  --  then switches out lights in bar and goes to lobby and switches out lights and sits in chair near stove , where he is joined by CHARLES . p. 108 IRA In the morning you have to show me how to disconnect that beer pump . CHARLES ( seating himself ) : Yes sir . IRA I know quite a little about refrigeration . When I was in the wholesale produce business , refrigeration , we had to know about that . CHARLES Yes sir .

IRA Mrs. Fenstermacher go out the kitchen door ? CHARLES No . Sleeping here tonight , in the room next to the young ladies . IRA I see . p. 109 CHARLES Uh-huh . That 's it .
