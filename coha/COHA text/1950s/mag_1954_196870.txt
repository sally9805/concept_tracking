One of the most influential leaders of U.S. Protestantism is a lean , white-haired man with bushy black eyebrows and a startlingly soft voice . Dr. Samuel McCrea Cavert 's parish has , from his youth , been almost the whole U.S. ; as much as any other man , he has been responsible for the movement toward unity among the nation 's Protestant Churches . Last week , at 65 , he had a new job-tending the garden of unity among the Protestant and Orthodox Churches of the world . <P> <P> Sam Cavert was a small-town boy , son of a farmer-businessman of Charlton , N.Y . ( pop . 100 ) . After Union College in Schenectady , N.Y. , he headed for Union Theological Seminary , graduated summa cum laude in 1915 , and was ordained a minister in the Presbyterian Church . His first ecumenical job came two years later : assistant secretary of the General Wartime Commission of the Churches . <P> <P> After World War I , Unionist Cavert joined the Federal Council of Churches , by 1930 became its executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly formed National Council of Churches , of which the Federal Council became a part-a vigorous collaboration of 30 churches representing a total membership of some 35.5 million . Presbyterian Cavert 's delicate balance of diplomacy and decision was indispensable in the council 's triumph over the formidable opposition of inertia and denominational differences . Cavert 's approach : " A council of churches is not so much an attempt to create unity as to practice such unity as we already have . " . After World War II , Cavert took a six month leave of absence from his job to help organize the World Council of Churches . Last month he retired from his old job to become U.S. executive secretary of the World Council , just in time to help plan its second assembly next August in Evanston , 111 . <P> " The National Council is the kind of organization that should be run by young people with a lot of ambition and drive , " said Sam Cavert last week . " The World Council should be headed by people who have a lot of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more appropriate for a man of my age . "
