In the hustle of U.S. railroads to buy diesels , the Pennsylvania Railroad was highballing along faster than ever . Only last November it ordered 226 locomotives , costing $38 million , to give it the largest number of diesel locomotives ( 820 ) of any U.S. railroad ( TiME , Nov. 21 ) . Last week the Pennsy increased its lead even more , signed up for an additional 214 locomotives costing $55 million , the biggest diesel order on record .
