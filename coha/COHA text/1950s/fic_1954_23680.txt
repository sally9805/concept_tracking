No Enemy but Time A Story by Maurice Rowdon Drawings by Sol Le Witt T HEv were sitting on a bench at Crewe station , waiting for the train going south , an old man and his wife . Their daughter kept a continual lookout She was calmer than either of them , middle-aged and rather red in the face . When the old man asked her a question , which he did very frequently , she only nodded dreamily , soothing him . At last the express train came in to the platform and , after a word from one of the guards , she called out to her parents : " This is the train ! Come on ! " She took up their cases , which were each of them strapped and labeled most neatly , and carried them onto the train . But the old man stayed where he was . He always had a little smile strangely , his eyes , which seemed to be listening rather " Is it the right train ? " He asked this question of the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his wife , a small woman dressed in black , sat meekly at his side looking the other way , unable to hear his words . Only when he bent toward her and enunciated his words very clearly and slowly could she hear what he said , and then she would smile , just as if someone had given her an affectionate touch . But her face had not the persistent , wondering smile of her husband . He was brown andfairly agile for his age , while she had become rather helpless , with the years gradually smothering her . It was clear that he did not believe this to be the train . His smile seemed to say , Thcy are playing some kind of joke , it is a fancy of the young , this can not he the train . He required courage . He got up from the bench and himself went to speak with one of the guards . Yes , it was the train . He succumbed now . His daughter , coming down from the train again , had seen him ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior , for she said , with a perfectly serious face : " Well , good-by , Mum . Good-by , Dad . I 've put the cases up on the rack . " He climbed into the train slowly , still doubtful . The matter had perhaps passed too smoothly . He peered at all the compartments and the people in them as he went by , with the same smile , not quite sure of his ground but smiling to keep up a certain polite contact with the deceiving world . He caught sight of a dining-car steward and went and touched his arm . He spoke softly , out of earshot of his daughter , who was attending to the old woman : " Excuse me . Is this the nine-thirty ? " The steward nodded and was about to pass on when the old man put to him a statement , more complicated and tentative than the question : But what I 'm looking for is the through-train to Blacksmith , arriving seven-fifteen . " He seemed to be tracking down his train by means of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steward , with a homely look in his eye , nodded again : " You 're all right . This is the train . " They kissed their daughter at the door of the compartment , where a young man and a woman with blond hair were already seated , strangers to each other . The daughter went back to the platform , calmly and seriously , and came level to the window so that she would see diem as the train drew out . The old man looked about the compartment . " Now where has she put the cases ? " he asked . He looked up at the racks and saw them , one on either side . His smile had something of admiration in it , but always it was the same smile . And though the cases were perfectly secure , fitting squarely into the racks , he went to each one of them and shifted them a little , pushing them with both hands , though the racks were not deep enough for them to go any farther . Then he sat down , opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The train drew slowly out of the station , and they waved briefly . W HEN the platform was no longer in sight he got up and tapped his wife on the knee . He felt it would be better if she sat next to him . He seemed happier with her at his side , and they faced the journey together . Their attitude was now solemn , as if they were present at an event which required tact , sympathy , and a certain poise . They were waiting , though the journey must last five hours . A question posed itself in his mind : What am I to do with my mackintosh ? The fields were very green after rain , and the sky was low and dark . He arrived at a decision . He took the mackintosh off and folded it carefully , swaying as he did so . He put the sleeves inside , shaking them down , then placed it on top of the cases . He did everything slowly , giving each of his movements the utmost consideration , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hard and strong , unlike the skin of his face . They were cruelly crackedand broken . He had worked for thirty years as clerk to a small engineering firm at the edge of his village , and he had put in almost an equal number of hours during his life as a gardener , doing odd jobs for the bigger houses . He had been sick three times during those thirty years . The first illness had kept him away from work for five days ; the second , eight weeks ; and the third , not long before his retirement , a month . Each morning he rose at five o'clock , and he was never in bed later than half-past nine . He had been married for the last forty years . The grass outside the window was not lovely to him : it was the world . T HE young man was at his side , near the window , and he was alone , more so than anyone else in the compartment . He was also better dressed , and probably he knew more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment : he gave him a guarded , appraising look , as if he could not properly credit him with existence , as if the young man was so much a foreigner that the thought of him made him giddy . And for a brief moment he did experience a certain giddiness as he looked at the young man 's jacket , at his crepe-soled shoes , and saw his frown . The train passed a small town , and the young man leaned forward suddenly , as if he had caught sight of something in the distance , behind the village . He leaned forward close to the window , then , mistaken perhaps , slowly leaned back again . The old man did not understand the significance of this gesture , though for him it was without doubt a public and professional one . Sometimes he would speak to his wife . He would bend down to her car as they passed the freshly watered fields and say his words slowly and loudly : We have half-an-hour , half-an-hour for the connection " ; " We change at Bletchley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At Bletchley we must ask . " Whenever one of the other people in the compartment got up to go to the lavatory , he would lean forward and shift his legs , looking up at them as they passed , as if something were now required of him , as part of the dignified ritual of being on a train . He even shifted sometimes when people passed by in the corridor . A thought occurred to him . Perhaps he was 63 intended to take an interest in his surroundings , for both the blond woman and the young man were looking through the window ? no , more than looking , craning their necks and staring very intently . In fact , they were thinking , and the trees outside were only the cradles of their thoughts . But the old mart knew , for himself , that they were closely studying the passing landscape , and with a certain academic intentness . So , accordingly , Ile leaned forward of a sudden , as if to take a closer look at something that had caught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the smile of one who admired himself for having just complied perfectly with a rule of professional and public conduct . He leaned back , for the moment satisfied . A T ONE of the subsidiary stations his wife made as if to get up , and this move caused him immediate alarm . In one instant all his confident assumptions about the connection to Blacksmith , the length of their wait at Bletchley , and the time of their arrival , folded up and sank in his mind , leaving him sick and anxious . The rituals of this journey , made by other creatures than himself , by those who caused him giddiness , were beginning to overpower him , and he felt for the first time that . he was fighting a losing battle on this journey . He drew his wife back in her seat , but this gesture came from his early confidence , which her movement destroyed only a moment later . " No , no , " he told her . " There are two hours more . " The poise he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . and he was no longer even sure whether they were traveling south . He knew none of the names of the stations , and it was possible that  --  this was his nightmare fear  --  they might be voyaging farther and farther into the land of other creatures , and never regain their foothold in the real , but really real world , namely , their cottage in Blacksmith . His wife had not heard him , so lie said again : " This isn't. our station , I do n't believe . " His voice ' was light and subdued ; during his life it had commanded nothing , precisely nothing . The old woman - nodded , understanding at last , but his anxiety continued , even as the crisis passed  --  or abated  --  and the train drew authority , the other side , the impossible . And lunch itself , somewhere in the deeps of the train , far down the limitless corridors , among the evil , quaint , and unknowable , lunch itself was impossible , not really real , just between you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the steward was only a symbol of a word , like a bell rung by an acolyte , and when the old man musingly repeated it to himself he was only catching at the symbol , turning it over in his hands , wondering at it , before he cast it out on the scrap-heap of dreams most absurd . He did not believe . He refused to be put upon . So there was in his constant smile - the confidence of one who knows , even while-he is obeying , that he is also being deceived . That was why he asked again and again about the train at Crewe , because he so rarely felt able to bestow the gift of his belief . MAGAZINE When the others had left the compartment a proposal formed itself in his wind : Let us eat . It was in no way caused by the dream-word lunch which had tinkled down the corridor . It was a proposal issuing out of nothing quite suddenly . He turned to his wife and , bending to her ear , called out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , and he chuckled lightly . There was no need to disturb the two cases on the racks . They were in their final and everlasting form , so to speak . They were strapped round , and from the handle of each hung a label , with the following address written in the neatest and slowest hand : " Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Cheameley , 5 , Eddison Terrace , Blacksmith . Traveling from Crewe to Blacksmith . " These cases need not be disturbed because there was a sling-bag which the old woman carried , and this contained , in separate paper parcels , their food for the journey . With the most devoted care she unwrapped two of the parcels , and they began to eat . There was also a Thermos flask , and a small silver tin containing saccharine tablets . This is not to say that his anxiety was over . It was only suspended . ow came a singular event which took his mind from the journey . It happened when they had poured tea into the small chromium cups . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now looking for the spoon to stir with . She looked in the side pockets of the sling-bag , then into the body of it , but the search yielded nothing . He watched her hands all this dine , holding his own cup , waiting . ? For the first time she spoke : " Did you say the side pocket ? " He smiled and nodded , so once more she felt inside the two pockets , and once more she found nothing . " I think it 's with the food , " she added , almost inaudibly . " But no , " he answered , warming to the joke . " I put it there myself . Lil saw me . " Then he put his cup on the floor of the compartment : " Give it to me . " His hands trembled as he took the bag . His search was more careful and slower . He did not look down at the bag , but sat with his abstracted smile , staring in front of him as he fumbled among the little articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those same listen-ing eyes , knowing you for the deceiver you were , clever enough , no doubt , and it was just like his quest for the one and only , the true and proper , the really real train of that day in all the world and the stars beyond . He was forced to realize that the spoon was in neither of the side pockets , and now he opened the main part and began fumbling among the parcels of food . His first search was useless . A Further decision was clearly required . He would take out each parcel in turn and lay it on the seat opposite : the spoon was sure to be there , at the bottom , hidden at present by the paper . " I know it 's here , " he murmured . " I remember plainly . " But he said this most to himself , and his wife did not look up at him . She was looking at the bag sleepily as he took . out each parcel in turn and laid it on the scat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcels , or to break the thread with which each was tied . She did not touch her tea , being too interested in the outcome of this search . But when the bag was quite empty of parcels he found no spoon , and his smile sect-tied to say , as he leaned back with the empty bag before him , that at last the deception had been discovered and that it was indeed right to withhold belief . It was almost clear that this latest deception had something to do with the train , and its prohibitive rituals . His realization that the spoon was lost stunned him . Slowly he put the parcels back into the bag , placing them squarely side by side along the base , then one on top of the other . lie took up his tea again and turned to his wife : " The spoon is gone . " She had understood him . " lArhat do we stir with ? " he asked . But this second remark she failed to hear . He bent farther toward her and asked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep did not pass from her face , but there was recognition in her eyes  --  the trace of cleverness lost long years ago  --  as she answered : " It 'll melt . " Nevertheless , the loss of the spoon was like the absence of a favorite companion , and they became thoughtful as they sipped their tea . W HEN the other occupants had returned to their corner seats after lunch , the old man took out his hand watch and glanced at it . He calculated , still gazing down at the great watch face , that there was little more than an hour to run , and lie realized in the same instant that so far there had been no indications of their actually traveling towards Bletchley . Now his anxiety grew . For what indication had the landscape given that this was the true train : what indication had been given by the other people in the compartment , by the passing stewards , by the subsidiary stations with their uncommon names ? Now there was only an hour more to run , and the signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great station drew near , there should be an increase of indications , a bustling , as it-were , and people warning each other . But there was only the same train on the same course , passing through landscape that looked much the same from hour to hour . The blond woman and the young man seemed in no way disturbed , for they were clearly at one with the train , not at all in his predicament , and almost able , in a mysterious way , so calm and powerful did they appear , to direct themselves of their own accord to their destination , and the train with them . Whereas he would only come upon his station by accident , after skirting many ambushes . H E FELT that at least he should now pre- pare himself for the end of the journey . An - hour was none too long , and even supposing that the deception was successful and that this train were destined for quite some other place than Bletchley , they would he wise to get down at the next station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mackintosh from the rack . It was his intention not to wear this mackintosh at the next station , and he realized that , since they had two cases with them , apart from the sling-bag , which his wife always carried , it would be a nuisance : more , it might make the carrying of the cases impossible . It must be remembered that at Crewe there had been his daughter to help . He took down one of the cases from the rack . He had attracted the notice of the blond-haired woman , and she was looking at him as he unbuckled the strap , clearly wondering whether , being old , he needed her help . Very deliberately , the strap now open , he folded his mackintosh and laid it over the case . He intended to pull the strap tight over it , so that it would no longer be an extra piece of luggage . He was about to buckle the strap when he grew dissatisfied with the arrangement of the mackintosh and began folding it again . Then it was ready and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swaying against the seat , and pulled it as far as he could . He wanted to reach the second hole , since he knew only this would secure the mackintosh beyond all doubt . The third hole would do , it was tight enough , but he wished to be quite sure that , perhaps as he ran for another train , the coat would not slip away from the case and be lost , like the spoon , for ever . So he released the strap again , rested , then pulled it as hard as he could toward him . This time he reached beyond the third hole , but still lie was not strong enough for the second . The blond woman was watching him and at last she put out her hand and helped him with it . Together they pulled the strap to the second hole , and the buckle went home . He looked into her eyes and said : " We have two cases , you see . " She smiled and nodded . It occurred to him that in her lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was about to put to her his anxious question , but she had already turned away and was looking out of the window . The train began to cross a valley , still and dark under clouds , and he sat quite still , staring before him , being rushed at seventy miles an hour into the unknowable . When he looked at his watch again the crisis happened for which he had been waiting during the whole trip . For he now knew , as a result of suddenly becoming aware of the time , that the train could not be bound for Bletchley . The journey , they had told him , would last five hours ; but five hours had already gone by , ten minutes ago , and still there was this terrifying lack of visible indications . He leaned forward . He wanted to fidget . His wife was quite unaware of his feelings , which were now those of a feverish man , for she only wanted to be allowed her old dreams , and the minimum of worldly events . At last he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with the stern brow . He turned to this young man , as being more reliable than the blond woman , as being calmer and more powerful , more at one with the intentions of the train , more able to understand the impossible . " Excuse me , " he said . The young man turned , his stern eyes full upon him . " We are making for Bletchley . But I do n't think this can be the right train . I think we must have passed it . " II E LOOKED from one window to the other , as if to point out that the countryside lacked proper indications . The young man stared into his rather watery blue eyes and asked him : " Bletchley ? Is that the station between Oxford and Cambridge ? " But these were only fresh dream-words , much the same as lunch , and there was nothing in them for the old man to grasp on . Indeed , he did not really hear the question . His eyes were abstracted , as if his anxiety were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer : he could only ask questions , and pass on to a further question before he had a reply . This he did . " I do n't think it can he stopping at Bletchley . It has been five hours already . " He shook his head meekly , and this time he smiled across at the blond woman , involving her . " We should have been there quite a time ago . " " Bletchley ? " the blond woman asked . She had the face of a healer as she turned to the window and saw the sign . " This is Bletchley . Look . " Among the trees the words in black could be seen , first on one board , then , two hundred yards later , on another : BLETCHLEY . The old man did not answer her , so sudden had been the verdict of providence . He simply looked her in the eyes as the train drew slowly into the waiting station , and at last Ile began to understand . Suffering a terrible relief , he took down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was indeed remarkable that so much deception should , at the very last moment , have worked round to his advantage . He did not speak to his wife as lie carried their cases one at a time to the platform , nor did he instantly make his inquiry about the next train . His reprieve required a brief celebration , and this was silence . T HEY reached their village that evening , soon after 7:30 . They were both tired as they left the station , among the deep-green , dripping leaves , and the utterly silent bushes . It was an ugly village , with a narrow main street consisting mostly of identical cottages built with red brick . Each cottage had its fOur windows , its brown front door , and its ornaments in the lower rooms . They saw no one on their way through the village , which lay in an evening repose , quite forlorn after rain . They walked slowly , lie with the two cases , and she with the sling-bag . She opened the door , while he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the weeds which during their two weeks ' absence had begun to put up their heads . He was recollecting gradually how each thing was placed , and once inside the cottage he began to pore over every heavy , aging object there , reviving it , entering the world again , a world at last where things could be touched and not denied . For here he was able to believe . He touched his row of old pipes , which he no longer smoked , and he took a duster devoutly along the crowded mantelpiece , among the ornaments , while the old woman brought him tea . He sat facing the window , sipping . He had taken down a book belonging to his father , and it lay on the table before him . It was the one book he possessed , and he had never before opened it . Though it was not particularly well bound , it had become one of the accepted ornaments in the room , with its special place near the silver trophy , which was also a gift from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even now he was hardly conscious of it at his elbow . But a moment later he opened it , and before him , near the foot of the page , he saw the words : The innocent and the beautiful Have no enemy but time . His eyes were rested for the first time . They were dreaming . He looked up from the page and stared into the distance , beyond the flowery wall , catching at something , seeking something far beyond himself . And at last his discovery came . He got up from his chair , his eyes still fixed on the wall , and murmured quietly : " That spoon . I 've just remembered . I 've got it in my mackintosh . " And the evening grew darker . Easter Morning BRENDAN GILL M AGDALENE saw Him first . He called her name And she ran to meet Him . " Touch me not , " He said . Something had happened worse than His being dead . Like any woman , she held herself to blame .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
