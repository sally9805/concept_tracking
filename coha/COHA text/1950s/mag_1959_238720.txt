Some of the modern architect 's best customers are the U.S. 's expanding schools and colleges . But one of his most difficult problems is how to blend modern architecture with the traditional style enshrined in many an ivy-covered wall . Last week Eero Saarinen , probably the most versatile of living architects , unveiled the best solution yet . <P> Commissioned last year to design two new colleges for Yale University , Saarinen ( Yale ' 34 ) quickly discovered that the standard vernacular of modern architecture would not do . First , the site was odd and irregular . Furthermore , the new colleges would have to exist cheek by jowl with two of Yale 's most determinedly pseudo-Gothic structures : the ten-story Payne Whitney Gymnasium and the Yale Graduate School . Talking with students , Saarinen discovered that undergraduates want their rooms to be as individual as possible , decided that the rooms should be " as random as those in an old inn rather than as standardized as those in a modern motel . " In addition , Saarinen was determined to discover an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like stripped-down cousins of the older structures built in the days of low construction costs . <P> <P> Courts and Crescents . Last week , as Yale released its plans for the two new colleges , it was clear that Saarinen had indeed turned his back on modern architecture 's shibboleth of repetition , regularity and smooth surfaces . Instead , Saarinen had produced two irregular structures of crescents and courts built of earthy , monolithic masonry . For the exterior walls , he devised a method of rubblestone construction that would do away with expensive hand labor . Stones varying in size from three to eight inches are placed in wood forms ; then cement mortar is pumped in through hoses . Before the cement has completely set , the wall surface is hosed off to expose the stones . The result Saarinen compares to " the walls of old Pennsylvania houses or the stone walls of the Cotswolds in England . " <P> About 250 students will be housed in each of the two new colleges . Their rooms , hardly any two of them similar , are variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open passageways that Saarinen feels are " not unlike a small Italian hill-town street . " The interiors , done in stone , oak and plaster , will be designed to suggest the scholar 's study rather than the clubman 's rumpus room . <P> <P> Bottles in the Buttery . For prestige , each college will have its own tower . For conviviality , each will come equipped with cellar-type butteries around whose round oak tables students and masters can gather . " It is hoped , " Saarinen added , " that television will be kept out of these rooms , so that they become centers of conversation and discussion rather than areas where people sit drugged by canned entertainment . " As for the name " buttery , " Saarinen made clear that he was not thinking of dairy products , pointedly cited the Oxford Dictionary derivation : " Buttery , sb . ME. ( app. a . OF . boterie - bouteillerie : - late L. botaria , f. bota , var. of butta cask , bottle ; see BUTT ) . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
