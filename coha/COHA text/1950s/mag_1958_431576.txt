95 TV 's New Trick : Hidden Commercials @# PROBABLY you 've heard about ? perhaps even worried about ? a revolutionary new way to beam messages into the human mind . Especially suited to TV and movies , the new idea-injecting technique is said to work while you , all unawares , are innocently enjoying the program . The idea-words appear superimposed on the picture images too fast and too dimly to be seen in the normal way . Yet they register on your mind . Despite rejection by the national networks , uneasy skepticism by the F.C.C. and alarm from people who fear that this strange development may bring wholesale invasion of privacy and risk of political tyranny , two means of reaching people 's subconscious minds by television are currently being tested . This month one of them , called Precon TV , was scheduled to be tried out on a large audience of TV watchers in and around Los Angeles . It was to have been Precon TV 's first big showing . Its rival , Subliminal Projection , about which almost no technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air in Bangor , Me. , and on a Canadian national hookup . Results for Subliminal Projection : inconclusive . For its debut on independent Station KTLA , Precon TV did not plan to use advertising . Instead , public-service messages ? like " Drive Safely , " " Support Your Community Chest , " or " Do n't Be a Litterbug " ? were to be tucked away into the telecast picture . But after this plan was announced , so much public criticism of the new technique boiled up that the trial was postponed . Controversy over these idea-injecting systems has swirled around three issues : ( 1 ) Are they legally proper ? ( 2 ) Are they ethically acceptable ? ( 3 ) And do they really work at all ? PRECON TV has a long history behind it . ( The trade name comes from the word " preconscious , " meaning " below the level of conscious awareness . " " Subliminal "  | means the same thing . ) Its inventors , Dr. Robert E. Corrigan of Los Angeles and Prof. Hal C. Becker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been testing the theories and working parts of Precon for the past eight years . Patents were applied for early in 1955 , but have not yet been issued . Consequently , the inventors decline to tell everything about their creation , though they have revealed the essentials . The basic equipment , the means of sprinkling television programs with invisible but receivable messages , is contained in a rectangular metal box about half the size of a standard table-top TV set . Its power unit , in a separate , much smaller container , runs on house current . This equipment is a kind of electronic mixing bowl , where printed information can be subtly stirred in with pictures . Inside the ma4n Precon TV cabinet , along with 17 vacuum tubes and a photo multiplier , is a little flying-spot scanner and , in front of its round face , a small frame for holding the text to be scanned . The text is printed on a transparent plastic slide , on a three-by-four-inch space . Picture signals from image-orthicon tubes in studio cameras focused on live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piped into the Precon TV apparatus on their way to the station 's antenna . To understand what happens to them in the Precon blender , remember that it takes one-thirtieth of a second for a cathode-ray tube to project one complete picture image on a televi- sion screen . In that time it has to scan the picture twice , each perusal taking onesixtieth of a second . INSIDE the Precon TV cabinet , with the aid of the pulsed light emitted by the flying-spot scanner , the printed message is superimposed on the incoming picture signals every other one-sixtieth of a second . ( The rate of mixture can be varied , as can the intensity of the pulsed light , which normally is less than onethird as bright as that of the picture signals . ) The well-mixed video brew then flows on to the station 's antenna , to which the program 's sound signals , not involved in Precon TV , proceed independently . Prof. Becker , an electronics engineer and physicist who teaches experimental neurology at Tulane University , points out a fascinating quirk : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can find out what the hidden message is by spreading the fingers of one hand and moving them rapidly up and down in front of your eyes . By varying the rate of this movement , you 'll soon find and match the rate at which the Precon message is being pulsed . Then you 'll be able to read it . THE two questions we are most often 1 asked about Precon , " said Dr. Corrigan , a former fighter pilot who is now a psychologist for the Douglas Aircraft Co. , " are How do you know that it works ? ' and Is it dangerous ? '  | " We have found ample proof that it works , " he continued , " in exhaustive experiments at Tulane University that we have been conducting since 1950 . In the course of finding that proof , we also became convinced that the Precon technique of communication ca n't be dangerous . There is no possibility of brainwashing by means of Precon , for each man is his own censor . His preconscious mind responds to Precon messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no better chance of putting something over on his preconscious mind than there is of hoodwinking his conscious mind . " Corrigan and Becker discovered people 's built-in censorship in tests in which three different types of words were very rapidly projected on a screen . Some of the words were neutral ? like " stove , " " table " and " rug . " Some had emotional impact ? " scream , " " blood , " " hate . " Others were obscene words . In repeated trials , the speed at which each word was flashed on the screen was slowed until the person being tested could say that he definitely had seen it . The researchers found that the emotional and obscene words had to be shown two or three times slower than the neutral words before people watching the screen could recognize them . Corrigan and Becker took this as firm evidence that the people were resisting and censoring upsetting words . Next , in addition to calling out when they could identify a word , the subjects were asked to press a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only did they push the lever sooner than they reported seeing the word ? thus proving preconscious perception ? but they reacted preconsciously to emotional and obscene words precisely as they did when conscious of them . They were censoring them without being aware of it . FURTHER tests showed , they contend , that people can be taught preconsciously . Corrigan and Becker arranged to give their subjects tiny electric shocks whenever certain neutral words were flashed on the screen . Then the shocks were stopped , but when the words that had been associated with them appeared again , the subjects reacted to them preconsciously as if they were words highly charged with emotion . They had learned , without realizing it , to attribute a new and painful meaning to harmless words . The Precon developers gave groups of people jumbled letters to rearrange into actual words . Before the test began , they showed the answers on a screen , too fast for anyone in the room to see . Preconsciously they were seen , however , and comparative tests indicated that the subjects solved the puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been slipped to their subconscious minds in advance . Finally , Corrigan and Becker expanded their experiments to theater-size audiences . They showed movies color cartoons ? in which printed information was hidden from conscious view . In one case , geometric symbols ? a triangle , a circle @# @#  | and a square ? were used . In the other . gasoline trade names were used . After the audiences had seen the film .. they were asked to tell whether they liked . felt indifferent to , or disliked each movie They were then shown the symbols and the trade names and asked to give their reactions to them . The results suggested that the way people had reacted to the symbols and trade names influenced the way they reacted to the movies . If they felt " positive " toward the preconscious information , they liked the movie ; if they felt " negative " about the information . they objected to the movie . The Precon inventors feel this point . then , is amply proved : Our preconscious likes and dislikes are the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to convince us by Precon TV to buy something we do n't want to buy , or do something we do n't want to do . Corrigan and Becker began their experiments with Precon apparatus with the thought that the technique would be wonderfully useful in education ( training films ) and psychotherapy ( reaching the consciously withdrawn patient by tapping him on the subconscious ) . They still are ardently convinced of this . The commercial possibilities occurred to them later . Already the inventors . through the newly created Precon Process &; Equipment Corp . of New Orleans . have marketed a counter-top or windowdisplay electrical device for flashing Precon advertising at passersby who think they are merely looking at an attractive illuminated color photograph . There is a strong likelihood that there 'll be Precon movies , too . Dr. Corrigan is convinced that if emotion-charged words suitable to the action of a movie are included in the film but are not consciously visible to its audience , the movie will gain in impact . Prof. Becker says the trick can be turned by superimposing the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better way would be to synchronize a special Precon movie projector with each theater projector . A leading motion-picture studio has indicated seriously that it would like to be shown how a Precon movie could be made . And a wag has already suggested what to call it ? a " feelie .
