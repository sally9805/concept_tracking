INDOCHINA <P> Cap St. Jacques is the Atlantic City of Indo-China , a city of palms and black sandy beach , at the mouth of the Saigon River . There , a group of French officers on sick leave were dining one evening last week with their families . A war was going on 800 miles to the north , but none of the officers was armed , nor were their sentries . At the entrance to the dining hall , Elysabeth , Nicole , Christian and Michel , children of M. Jean Perrin , vice president of Air Viet Nam , played hide &; seek . <P> While white-clad Vietnamese waiters served the course , a column of native soldiers in the green French Union battle-dress emerged from the jungle-covered mountain which overlooks the Cap and marched up to the lighted dining hall in columns of two . They were armed with regulation grenades and Sten guns and carried machetes . The first grenade , thrown from the kitchen , killed Bartender Tuyen instantly . Vietnamese Cook Nguyen Van Loc played dead , but a green-clad soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shot him . In the hallway other green-clad soldiers shot down the Perrin children , caught little Michel running away , hacked him to death with machetes . They hurled grenades and emptied Sten guns into the crowded dining room . Then they waded into the shambles , machetes swinging . After robbing the dead , they disappeared as quietly as they had come . <P> The killers were Communists . Wearing stolen uniforms , they were carrying out orders issued by the Central Committee of the South Viet Nam Communist Party from its secret headquarters in the swamps . The order : indiscriminate terrorism . The Communists ' aim : to frighten people from supporting the new Nguyen Van Tarn government . In the eight weeks since the government was formed , they have committed 67 murders , 87 attempted murders , and nine kidnapings . But no outrage yet matched that at the Cap St. Jacques . When French soldiers reached the dining room , they found eight officers , six children , two women and four Vietnamese servants dead and 23 wounded men , women &; children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dead woman to simulate death and a small boy who had hidden behind a chair remained uninjured . <P> Next day , before the coffins of the Cap St. Jacques victims , a French army chaplain , clenching his fists , warned the onlooking soldiery that Christian charity forbade that their vengeance be turned against innocent people . The French grimly noted that no such restraints bound their efforts to run down the guilty .
