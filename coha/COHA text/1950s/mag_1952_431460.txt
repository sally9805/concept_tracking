THE biggest underground railroad in the world is n't big enough . If you could make a single , straight track of New York 's 239 miles of subway lines , it would reach from New York to Alexandria , Va . Yet work is to begin this summer on a new line that will add 29 miles more , extending beneath Second Avenue from Manhattan 's lower East Side , past the gleaming United Nations Headquarters and the fashionable East River residences uptown , to connect with existing lines in The Bronx . But even this will be only the beginning of a new expansion program . Every weekday , more than 13,170 subway trains travel under New York streets . It would take every last locomotive on the Chesapeake &; Ohio , Baltimore &; Ohio , Denver &; Rio Grande Western , Southern Pacific , Chicago &; North Western , Missouri Pacific , New York Central and Northern Pacific railroads to haul that many trains . From Monday through Friday , the New York subways daily carry more than 4,700 , -  | 000 passengers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico and Utah combined . Yet long-range planners are seriously considering proposals to lure a lot more people into traveling to and from Manhattan Island underground . One plan calls for building a beltlike subway connecting New jersey railroads with certain key points in New York City . This subway would require two tunnels under the Hudson River and a new route under the city from the Radio City area to the lower tip of the island . Fastest Subway in the World Of the 17 subway systems in the world , New York 's is the fastest , running a train every two to four minutes during peak traffic hours . ( Rome 's is the slowest , sending a train threading its way among the foundations of two-thousand-year-old buildings every two hours . ) Except in case of an occasional breakdown , passengers on the main routes are never kept waiting more than 20 minutes for a train , even during the middle of the night . The New York subways have a rolling stock of 6,800 cars . more passenger cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern , Santa Fe , Union Pacific , Atlantic Coast Line , Southern and Wabash railroads could muster altogether . Subway trains are made up of from three to 10 cars , each one regularly inspected every 1,000 miles , and are not allowed to travel faster than 50 miles an hour . Over 3,500 motormen drive the trains , and 4,344 conductors control the car doors , taking care not to leave any arms or legs sticking out as each train departs from a station . More than 260 dispatchers and as many more assistants control subway traffic , following the progress of trains between stations by means of consecutively flashing lights on control boards . Cheapest Train Ride on Earth Of New York 's 500 subway stations ? nearly as many passenger stations as the world 's largest surface railroad , the Pennsylvania , has along its 25,000 miles of track ? the busiest is at Times Square , center of the theater district . More than 48,000,000 people , as many as there are in the entire South , passed through its turnstiles last year . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalks , and strollers above can often feel the rumble of  | passing trains in the soles of their feet . One station , however , is 184 feet below the street , a distance equivalent to the height of a 14-story building . Though the cost of riding on the New York subways rose from a nickel to a clime in June , 1948 , they still provide the cheapest long-distance train ride on earth . For 10 cents a passenger can travel 231/4 miles , in 74 minutes , without having to change trains . The . outermost points of the huge underground railroad are 27.27 miles apart . Brother , Can You Spare 700.000 Dimes ? It is a long-standing , sour joke among New Yorkers , grateful as they are to be able to ride so far for so little , that their subways always run at a loss . For instance , in the six months ending December 31 , 1951 , though the subway system had collected nearly S75,000,000 in fares ? considerably more than the U.S. Treasury collected in taxes in any wear prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red . Passengers who dropped slugs or foreign coins into the subway turnstiles ? one in every 26,500 fares ? were a minor source of financial loss . The city 's Board of Transportation used to clump this dubious revenue periodically into New York Harbor . Last December , however , it finally recouped some of its loss . It sold 37,803 coins from 29 foreign countries to a Broadway dealer for about $1,700 . A much more impressive source of income for the New York subway system is its slice of the sale price of all goods and services ploy provided on hundreds of its station platforms . Here passengers can buy peanuts , candy bars , packaged crackers , chewing gum and soft drinks from vending machines ; purchase flowers , bakery products , mixed nuts , boxes of candy , books , magazines , newspapers , and complete light lunches from shops and stands ; have their shoes shined ; store their packages in coin-operated lockers ; and avail themselves of pay phones and pay toilets . From this commercial hurly-burly the city in 1951 extracted slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned newspapers and wads of gum left in the wake of subway riders pose a major housekeeping problem . Thousands of waste- paper containers are placed in strategic spots on the platforms , but the passengers ' aim is often poor and their instinct for neatness weak . It takes 1,502 porters to clean up the daily mess and to wash off the wall drawings of some of the system 's more artistic young patrons . The cost of this constant tidying-up process is several million dollars a year , but there is a shred of financial return . The city disposes of more than 100 tons of waste paper from the subways every month . In one recent year the total income from this strange by-product of underground transportation was $21,000 . Has Anybody Seen My Snake ? Passengers lose more than their tempers on the subway ? forgetful riders have left behind thousands of items of property , ranging from $11,800 in cash ( never recovered ) to the body of a snake , carefully preserved in a jar . Last year 50,000 items were collected , including 6,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other years the residue has included false teeth , a wooden leg , a bass viol , crutches and guns . As the unclaimed property accumulates , the Board of Transportation auctions it off . People are sometimes moved to write to the Board and tell its members how to improve subway travel , including proposals for smoking cars ( no smoking is allowed underground ) and dining cars ! Regular passenger cars , costing $66,000 , arc 67 feet long and seat 80 people . No one has risked a guess as to the maximum number of standees that can be jammed into a car , but , inadvertent attempts to find out are made nearly every day . The Board of Transportation cheerily estimates that at the present time during rush hours there are 165 standees to every 100 passengers seated , a figure that calloused subway regulars are inclined to think low . More Room ? Standing Room Sitting in a subway car seems to be going out of style , anyway . Cars of a special eight-car , stainless-steel train , built in 1949 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for standees . Cars similar to these will undoubtedly be purchased for the forthcoming Second Avenue line and perhaps someday will be run- ping over a belt line from New Jersey to New York and back . Until these additional lines and trains are available , thousands of subway passengers during rush hours will have continued reason to exclaim , as did Tallulah Bankhead in a recent radio skit . " Sir , kindly remove my eye from your el-bow ! " Subways May Ease Auto Jams Anyone who has ridden on a New York subway train during a rush hour , trapped in a strait jacket of perspiring human bodies . can sympathize with the widespread longing among regular passengers for the extra elbow room that more rolling stock and additional routes would afford . But the main reason more subways are needed lies above the heads of the subsurface sufferers . Too many commuters and visitors , inspired b ' the handsome bridges and vehicular tunnels available , are driving into the city or arriving on out-of-town buses . Add their vehicles to those normally operating in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is threatening to send New Yorkers out of their minds ? and , worse yet for local business , out of New York . No one yet has thought up a workable way to untangle the snarl . Rerouting traffic has caused confusion and raised howls from merchants without taking out the kinks . Now New York and New Jersey planning commissions have begun to wonder if a new subway , linking the two states at the Hudson 's banks , might not be the solution . Overcrowding Isn ' ' t New New York 's subways have been a source of wonder and irritation . right from their start , on the afternoon of October 27 , 1904 , when Mayor George B. McClellan ( son of the famous Civil War General ) ran the first subway train nearly all the way to the end of the nine-mile line . The lure of the new subway drew so many people that the few station platforms were " packed to suffocation , " wrote a N.Y . Herald reporter . Another newsman reported in astonishment that " men fought , kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station at the end of the line soon became so great that police reserves had be be called . " Hats were broken and coats torn off . " Variations of that scene have been enacted every day ever since .  |
