The angriest running battle for control of a major U.S. movie company reached a climax last week . At a special stockholders ' meeting , the management of Hollywood 's infirm old lion , Loew 's Inc. , owners of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios , outvoted the forces of Millionaire Canadian Contractor Joseph Tomlinson , Loew 's biggest ( 5% ) and unhappiest stockholder . By 3,449,446 ballots to 519,435 , shareholders gave President Joseph R. Vogel a solid grip on his board of directors by increasing its membership from 13 to 19 . Then they voted in nine management nominees to fill ten empty seats ( including four recent resignations ) . The tenth seat fell to the management 's critics , who put all their cumulative votes behind Veteran Movie Executive Sam Briskin , 60 , onetime production chief for Columbia and RKO . Final count : 13 directors for Vogel , six for his critics . <P> One notable byproduct of Vogel 's victory was his apparent defeat of two mighty Wall Street investment houses-Lehman Bros , and Lazard Freres-who are dissatisfied with Loew 's management ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control about 3,000,000 of the 5,336,777 shares outstanding . Yet last week they voted only 150,000 shares for the rebel cause . A Lehman-Lazard spokesman contended that the two firms can still control approximately 3,000,000 shares . But they do not appear to want to lead a proxy fight themselves , nor do they support Tomlinson 's bid to power . Actually , the bankers aimed only to joggle Loew 's management by placing more real movie pros on the board ; in this case their choice was Briskin . <P> It will take harried President Vogel more than a friendly board to put Loew 's tangled affairs back in order . Despite many economies , he admitted that Loew 's last quarter , ending Aug. 31 , " was very bad . " Wall Street buzzes that the company had to borrow $5,000,000 recently to meet payrolls , that its moviemaking operations are losing $1,000,000 a month , and that Loew 's may be forced to pass its usual 25 cash dividend this quarter . Said Millionaire Tomlinson , who sees his $5,000,000 investment in Loew 's growing slimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my biggest mistake was to buy into this company . "
