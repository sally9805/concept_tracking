txt William Saroyan , the Pulitzer Prize winning author of " The Time of Your Life " says his has come to the time when he has to go abroad to earn money to pay his back taxes so he can come back home again . Mr. Saroyan , noted for his bright outlook about most things , is pretty gloomy about Uncle Sam 's tax bite . Like his daring young man on the flying trapeze , he ca n't get anywhere ; he owes $30,000 in back taxes , not even including 1958 and he says " I do n't have anything except old clothes . " He figures it will take some $200 , - 000 to put him back on his feet . He did n't squander his money , he claims ; Uncle got too much of it . " I wanted to produce a play and the Government took that money away from me .
