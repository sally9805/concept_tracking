My Shipmate  --  Columbus By STEPHEN WILDER We 've been taught from childhood that the earth is round and that Columbus discovered America . But maybe we take too much on faith . This first crossing for instance . Were you there ? Did you see Columbus land ? Here 's the story of a man who can give us the straight facts . The laughter brought spots of color to his cheeks . He stood there for a while , taking it , and then decided he had had enough and would sit down . A whisper of amusement still stirred the room as he returned to his seat and the professor said , " But just a moment , Mr. Jones . Wo n't you tell the class what makes you think Columbus was not the ' bold skipper ' the history books say he was . After all , Mr. Jones , this is a history class . If you know more or better history than the history books do , is n't it your duty to tell us ? " Illustration : He clutched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " I did n't say he was n't , " Danny Jones said desperately as the laughter started again . Some profs were like that , he thought . Picking on one student and making the rest of the class laugh and think what a great guy the prof was and what a prize dodo the hapless student was . " I said , " Danny went on doggedly , " Columbus might not have been  --  maybe was n't  --  the bold skipper the history books claim he was . I ca n't prove it . No one can . I have n't a time machine . " Again it was the wrong thing to say . The professor wagged a finger in front of his face and gave Danny a sly look . " Do n't you , " he said , " do n't you indeed ? I was beginning to think you had been willed H. G. Wells ' famous literary invention , young man . " That one had the class all but rolling in the aisles . Danny said desperately , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for sure if Columbus was born in Genoa . They just think he was . So they also could be wrong about  --  " Abruptly the professor 's face went serious . " My dear Mr. Jones , " he said slowly , acidly , " do n't you think we 've had enough of fantasy ? Do n't you think we ought to return to history ? " Danny sat down and for a moment shut his eyes but remained conscious of everyone looking at him , staring at him , evaluating . It was n't so easy , he decided , being a sophomore transfer student from a big city college , where almost everything went and there was a certain amount of anonymity in the very size of the classes , to a small town college where every face , after a week or so , was familiar . Danny wished he had kept his big yap shut about Columbus , but it was too late now . They 'd be ribbing him for weeks .... On his way back to the dorm after classes he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , a fellow named Groves , who said , " How 's the boy , Danny . Next thing you 'll tell us is that Cortez was really a sexy Spanish broad with a thirty-eight bust who conquered Montezuma and his Indians with sex appeal . Get it , boy . I said  --  " " Aw , lay off , " Danny grumbled . The other boy laughed , then shrugged , then said , " Oh yeah , forgot to tell you . There 's a telegram waiting for you in the dorm . House-mother 's got it . Well , see you , Vasco da Gama . " Danny trudged on to the Georgian-style dormitory and went inside , through the lobby and behind the stairs to the house-mother 's office at the rear of the building . She was a kindly-looking old woman with a halo of white hair and a smile which made her a good copy of everyone 's grandmother . But now her face was set in unexpectedly grim lines . " Telegram for you , Danny , " she said slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered it . " She held out a yellow envelope . " I 'm afraid it 's some bad news , Danny . " She seemed somehow reluctant to part with the little yellow envelope . " What is it ? " Danny said . " You 'd better read it yourself . Here , sit down . " Danny nodded , took the envelope , sat down and opened it . He read , MR . DANNY JONES , WHITNEY COLLEGE , WHITNEY , VIRGINIA . REGRET TO INFORM YOU UNCLE AVERILL PASSED AWAY LAST NIGHT PEACEFULLY IN HIS SLEEP LEAVING UNSPECIFIED PROPERTY TO YOU . It was signed with a name Danny did not recognize . " I 'm terribly sorry , " the house-mother said , placing her hand on Danny 's shoulder . " Oh , that 's all right , Mrs. Grange . It 's all right . You see , Uncle Averill was n't a young man . He must have been in his eighties . " " Were you very close to him , Danny ? " " No , not for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grange smiled . " Well , when I was eight or nine , I used to see him all the time . We stayed at his place on the coast near St. Augustine , Florida , for a year . I  --  I feel sorry about Uncle Averill , Mrs. Grange , but I feel better about something that happened in class today . I  --  I think Uncle Averill would have approved of how I acted . " " Want to talk about it ? " " Well , it 's just he always said never to take any so-called fact for granted , especially in history . I can almost remember his voice now , the way he used to say , ' if ever there 's an argument in history , sonny , all you ever get is the propaganda report of the side which won . ' You know , Mrs. Grange , I think he was right . Of course , a lot of folks thought old Uncle Averill was a little queer . Touched in the head is what they said . " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkering around in his basement . Funny , nobody ever knew on what . He would n't let anybody near the place . He had a time lock and everything . What nobody could figure out is if he was trying so hard to guard something that was in the basement , why did he sometimes disappear for weeks on end without even telling anybody where he went . And I remember , " Danny went on musing , " every time he came back he went into that harangue about history , as if somehow he had confirmed his suspicions . He was a funny old guy but I liked him . " " You remembering him so vividly after all these years will be the best epitaph your uncle could have , Danny . But what are you going to do ? About what he left you , I mean . " " Uncle Averill always liked promptness . If he left something for me , he 'd want me to pick it up immediately . I guess I ought to go down there to St. Augustine as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll have to take an emergency leave of absence . " " Under the circumstances , I 'm sure the college will approve . Do you think your uncle left you anything  --  well  --  important ? " " Important ? " Danny repeated the word . " No , I do n't think so . Not by the world 's standards . But it must have been important to Uncle Averill . He was a  --  you know , an image-breaker  --  " " An iconoclast , " supplied Mrs. Grange . " Yes 'm , an iconoclast . But I liked him . " Mrs. Grange nodded . " You 'd better get over and see the Dean . " An hour later , Danny was at the bus depot , waiting for the Greyhound that would take him over to Richmond , where he would meet a train for the south and Florida . * * * * * It was a rambling white stucco house with a red tile roof and a pleasant grove of palm trees in front and flame-red hibiscus climbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him at the door . " I 'll get right down to business , Mr. Jones , " Tartalion said after they had entered the house . " Your uncle wanted it that way . " " Wait a minute , " Danny said , " do n't tell me they already had the funeral ? " " Your uncle did n't believe in funerals . His will stipulated cremation . " " But , it was so  --  " " Sudden ? I know , the will was n't officially probated . But your uncle had a judge for a friend , and under the circumstances , his wishes were granted . Now , then , you know why you 're here ? " " You mean , what he left me ? I thought I 'd at least get to see his  --  " " His body ? Not your uncle , not old Averill Jones . You ought to know better . Sonny , " the lawyer asked abruptly , " how well did you know the old man ? " The sonny rankled . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer and girls and I 'm no sonny anymore . He sighed and thought of his history class , then thought of Uncle Averill 's opinion of history , and felt better . He explained the relationship to Mr. Tartalion and waited for the lawyer to speak . " Well , it beats me , " Tartalion admitted . " Why he left it to a nephew he has n't seen in ten or eleven years , I mean . Do n't just look at me like that . You know that contraption he had in the basement , do n't you ? How he would n't let a soul near it , ever ? Then tell me something , Danny . Why did he leave it to you ? " " You 're joking ! " Danny cried . " I was your uncle 's lawyer . I would n't joke about it . He said it was the only thing he had worth willing . He said he willed it to you . Want me to read you the clause ? " Danny nodded . He felt strangely flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contraption which no one but Averill Jones had ever seen  --  had been the dearest thing in the old bachelor 's life . Actually , he was not Danny 's uncle , but his grand-uncle . He had lived alone in St. Augustine and had liked living alone . The only relative he had tolerated was Danny , when Danny was a small boy . Then , as Danny approached his ninth birthday , the old man had said , " They 're teaching you too much at school , son . Too many wrong things , too many highfalutin ' notions , too much just plain old hogwash . Why do n't you kind of make yourself scarce for a few years ? " It had been blunt and to the point . It had made Danny cry . He had n't thought of what had happened that last day he 'd seen his grand-uncle for years , but he thought of it now . * * * * * " But why ca n't I come back and see you ? " he had asked tearfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why , uncle ? " " Hey , come on now and stop your blubbering all over me . If you ca n't you ca n't . " " You have to tell me why ! " " Stubborn little critter . Well , I like that . All right , I 'll tell you why . Because the machine has a funny kind of fuel , that 's why . It does n't run on gasoline , Danny , or anything like that . " " What does it do , uncle ? " But the old man had shaken his head . " Maybe someday after I 'm gone you 'll find out . If anyone finds out , it will be you , and that 's a promise . " " You still did n't tell me why I have to go away . " " Because  --  well , do n't go telling this to your folks , son , or they 'll think old Uncle Averill has a screw loose somewheres  --  because that machine I have downstairs runs on faith . On faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they think is important and do a lot of talking and sermoning about , but a different kind of faith . Personal faith , you might say . Faith in a dream or a belief , no matter what people think . And  --  you know what ruins that faith ? " " No , " Danny had said , his eyes very big . " Knowledge ! " cried his uncle . " Too much so-called knowledge which is n't knowledge at all , but hearsay . That 's what they 're teaching you . In school , other places , every day of your life . I 'll tell you when you can come back , Danny : when you 're ready to throw most of it overboard . All right ? " He had had to say all right . It was the last time he had ever seen his uncle , but those were n't the last words Averill Jones had spoken to him , for the old man had added as he got up to go : " Do n't forget , son . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is propaganda  --  from a winner 's point of view . If a side lost the war and got stamped on , you never see the war from its point of view . If an idea got out of favor and stamped on , the idea is ridiculed . Do n't forget it , son . If you believe something , if you know it 's right , have faith in it and do n't give a mind what people say . Promise ? " Danny , his eyes stinging with tears because somehow he could sense he would never see Uncle Averill again , had said that he promised . " ... to my nephew , Danny Jones , " the lawyer was reading . " So , you see , you 'll have to go right down there and look the thing over . Naturally , I 'll have to leave the house while you do so and I wo n't be able to return until you tell me I can  --  " " But why ? " " Were n't you listening ? " " I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clause says you 're to examine the machine alone , with no one else in the house . It 's perfectly legal . If that 's what your uncle wanted , that 's what he 'll get . Are you all set ? " Danny nodded and Tartalion shook his hand solemnly , then left the room . Danny heard the lawyer 's footsteps receding , heard the front door open and close , heard a car engine start . Then , slowly , he walked through the living room of his dead uncle 's house and across the long , narrow kitchen and to the basement stairs . His hands were very dry and he felt his heart thudding . He was nervous , which surprised him . * * * * * But why ? he thought , why should it surprise me ? All my life , Uncle Averill 's basement has been a mystery . Let 's face it , Danny-boy , you have n't exactly had an adventurous life . Maybe Uncle Averill was the biggest adventure in it , with his secret machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling job when you were small , because that machine means mystery to you . It 's probably not much more than a better mousetrap , but you want to believe it is , do n't you ? And you 're nervous because the way Uncle Averill kept you and anyone else away from his basement when you were a kid makes it a kind of frightening place , even now . He opened the basement door with a key which the lawyer had given him . Beyond the door were five steps and another door  --  this one of metal . It had had a time lock in the old days , Danny remembered , but the lock was gone now . The metal door swung ponderously , like the door to a bank vault , and then Danny was on the other side . It was dark down there , but faint light seeped in through small high windows and in a few moments Danny 's eyes grew accustomed to the gloom . The basement was empty except for what looked like a big old steamer trunk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had childhood visions of an intricate maze of machinery cluttering up every available square foot of basement space , but now he knew that whatever it was which had taken up so much of Uncle Averill 's time could fit in the odd-looking steamer trunk in the center of the floor and thus was n't too much bigger than a good-size TV set . He walked slowly to the trunk and stood for a few moments over the lid . It was an ancient-looking steamer : Uncle Averill must have owned it since his own youth . Still , just a plain trunk . Danny was in no hurry to open the lid , which did not seem to be locked . For a few moments , at least , he could shield himself from further disappointment  --  because now he had a hunch that Uncle Averill 's machine was going to be a first-class dud . Maybe , he thought gloomily , Uncle Averill had simply not liked to be with people and had used the ruse of a bank-vault door and an empty steamer trunk to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history class , Danny decided that  --  after all  --  sometimes that was n't a bad idea . Finally , he called himself a fool for waiting and threw up the trunk-lid . A small case was all he saw inside , although the interior of the trunk was larger than he had expected . A man could probably curl up in there quite comfortably . But the case  --  the case looked exactly like it ought to house a tape-recorder . Danny reached in and hauled out the case . It was heavy , about as heavy as a tape-recorder ought to be . Danny placed it down on the floor and opened it . What he saw was a battery-powered tape-recorder . His disappointment increased : Uncle Averill had left a message for him , that was all . Dutifully , however , he set the spools and snapped on the switch . A voice from yesterday  --  Uncle Averill 's voice  --  spoke to him . * * * * * " Hallo , Danny , " it said . " The way the years roll by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seventeen ? Eighteen ? Twenty ? Well , it does n't matter  --  if you still believe . If you have faith . Faith in what ? Maybe now you 're old enough to know . I mean faith in  --  not having faith . That is , faith in not taking faithfully all the silly items of knowledge they try to cram down your throat in school . See what I mean ? Remember what I always said about history , Danny : you get propaganda , is all , from the winning side . If you got faith enough in yourself , Danny , faith enough not to believe everything the history books tell you , that 's the kind of faith I mean . Because such a faith gave me the most interesting life a man ever lived , make no mistake about that . " I 'm dead , Danny . Yep , old Uncle Averill is dead . Because this tape-recorder wo n't be left you in my will until I am dead . But , no regrets , boy . I had a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're about to find out . Do you believe ? Do you believe the way I have in mind ? Make no mistake about it now , son . If you do n't believe , you might as well burn these spools and go home . " Danny considered . He remembered what had happened in his history class . Was n't that the sort of faith Uncle Averill had in mind ? Faith not to believe in historical fairy tales ? Faith to doubt when one ought to doubt ? Faith to be skeptical .... " Good , " said the voice from the past . " Then you 're still here . Look in front of you , Danny-boy . The trunk . The old steamer . Know what it is ? " " No , " Danny said , then clamped a hand over his mouth . For a moment he had actually believed he was talking to the dead man . " It 's a time machine , " said his Uncle 's voice . There was a silence . The tape went on winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the voice continued : " No , your old grand-uncle is n't nuts , Danny . It 's a time machine . I know it 's a time machine because I used it all my life . You expected some kind of complicated gadget down here , I know . I made everybody think it was a gadget . Going down to your basement and tinkering with a gadget is fine in our culture . Hell 's fire , boy , it 's approved behavior . But locking a bank-vault door behind you and curling up in a steamer trunk , that is n't approved . Now , is it ? " I 'll tell you about this here time machine , sonny . It is n't a machine at all , in the strict sense of the word . You can see that . It 's just  --  well , an empty box . But it works , and what else ought a fellow to care about . " Funny how I got it . I was eighteen or twenty , maybe . And my Grand-uncle Daniel gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Averill to Daniel . So when you have a grand-nephew , see that his name 's Averill , understand ? Keep it going , Danny . Because this trunk is old . A lot older than you think . " And you can travel through time in it . Do n't look at me like that , I know what you 're thinking . There is n't any such thing as time travel . In the strict sense of the word , it 's impossible . You ca n't resurrect the past or peek into the unborn future . Well , I do n't know about the future , but I do know about the past . But you got to have faith , you got to be a kid at heart , Danny . You got to have this dream , see ? " Because you do n't travel anywhere . But your mind does , and it 's like you wake up in somebody else 's body , drawn to him like a magnet , somebody else  --  somewhen else . Your body stays right here , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended animation . But you  --  the real you , the you that knows how to dream and to believe  --  you go back . " Do n't make the mistake I made at first . It 's no dream in the usual sense of the word . It 's real , Danny . You 're somebody else back there , all right , but if he gets hurt , you get hurt . If he dies  --  taps for Danny Jones ! You get me ? " * * * * * The dead man 's voice chuckled . " But do n't think this means automatically you 'll be able to travel through time . Because you got to have the proper attitude . You 've got to believe in yourself , and not in all the historical fictions they give you . Now do you understand ? If you 're skeptical enough and if at the same time you like to dream enough  --  that 's all it takes . Want to try it ? " Suddenly the voice was gone . That was all there was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bitter disappointment enveloped him  --  not because Uncle Averill had left him nothing but an old steamer trunk but because Uncle Averill had been , to say the least , off his rocker . The fabulous machine in the basement was  --  nothing . Just a steamer trunk and an incredible story about time-traveling . Danny sighed and began to walk back toward the cellar stairs . He paused . He turned around uncertainly and looked at the trunk . After all , he had promised ; at least he 'd promised himself that he 'd carry out his peculiar uncle 's wishes . Besides , he 'd come all the way down here from Whitney College and he ought to at least try the machine . But there was n't any machine . Try the trunk then ? There was nothing to try except curling up in it and maybe closing the lid . Uncle Averill was a practical joker , too . It might be just like Uncle Averill to have the lid snap shut and lock automatically so Danny would have to pound his knuckles black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , sonny ? would be Uncle Averill 's point . You believed me , and you should have known better . Danny cursed himself and returned to the trunk . He gazed down at the yawning interior for a few seconds , then put first one foot , then the other over the side . He sat down and stared at a peeling blue-paper liner . He rolled over and curled up . The bottom of the trunk was a good fit . He reached up and found a rope dangling down toward him . He pulled the lid down , smiling at his own credulity , and was engulfed in total darkness . But it would be wonderful , he found himself thinking . It would be the most wonderful thing in the world , to be able to travel through time and see for yourself what really had happened in all the world 's colorful ages and to take part in the wildest , proudest adventures of mankind . He thought , I want to believe . It would be so wonderful to believe . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but his history class was very important . It was crucial . Everything depended on his history class . Because he doubted . He did not want to take Columbus ' bravery and intelligence for granted . There were no surviving documents , so why should he ? Maybe Columbus was a third-rater ! Maybe  --  at least you did n't have to worship him as a hero just because he happened to discover ... Now , what did he discover ? In absolute darkness and a ringing in the ears and far away a dim glowing light and larger and brighter and the whirling whirling spinning flashing I do n't believe but strangely somehow I have faith , faith in myself , buzzing , humming , glowing ... The world exploded . There was a great deal of laughter in the tavern . At first he thought the laughter was directed at him . Giddily , he raised his head . He saw raw wood rafters , a leaded glass window , a stained and greasy wall , heavy wood-plank tables with heavy chairs and a barbarous-looking crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in front of him and he raised it to his lips without thinking . It was ale , the strongest ale he had ever tasted . He got it down somehow without gagging . The laughter came again , rolling over him like a wave . A serving girl scurried by , skirts flashing , a rough tray of clay mugs balanced expertly on one hand . A man with a sword dangling at his side staggered to his feet drunkenly and clawed at the girl , but she shoved him back into his seat and kept walking . The third wave of laughter rolled and then there was a brief silence . " Drink too much , Martin Pinzon ? " Danny 's companion at the long board-table asked . He was an evil-looking old man with a patch over one eye and a small white spade-shaped beard and unshaven cheeks . " Not me , " Danny said , amazed because the language was unfamiliar to him yet he could both understand and speak it . " What 's so funny ? " he asked . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped his back and the mouth parted to show ugly blackened teeth and the old man laughed so hard spittle spotted his beard . " As if you did n't know , " he managed to say . " As if you did n't know , Martin Pinzon . It 's that weak-minded sailor again , the one who claims to have a charter for three caravels from the Queen herself . Drunk as Bacchus and there 's his pretty little daughter trying to get him to come home again . I tell you , Martin Pinzon , if he is n't ... " * * * * * But now Danny was n't listening . He looked around the tavern until he saw the butt of all the laughter . Slowly , drawn irresistibly , Martin Pinzon  --  or Danny Jones  --  got up and walked over there . The man was drunk as Bacchus , all right . He was a man perhaps somewhat taller than average . He had a large head with an arrogant beak of a nose dominating the face , but the mouth was weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could not have been more than seventeen . The girl was saying , " Please , papa . Come back to the hotel with me . Papa , do n't you realize you 're sailing tomorrow ? " " Gowananlemebe , " the man mumbled . " Papa . Please . The Queen 's charter  --  " " I was drunk when I took it and drunk when I examined those three stinking caravels and  --  " he leaned forward as if to speak in deepest confidence , but his drunken voice was still very loud  --  " and drunk when I said the world was round . I  --  " " You hear that ? " someone cried . " Old Chris was drunk when he said the world was round ! " " He must a ' been ! " someone else shouted . Everyone laughed . " Come on , papa , " the girl pleaded . She wore a shawl over her dress and another shawl on her head . Her blonde hair barely peeked out , and she was beautiful . She tried to drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was too heavy for her . She looked around the room defiantly as the laughter surged again . " Brave men ! " she mocked . " A bunch of stay-at-homes . Wo n't somebody help me ? Papa sails tomorrow . " " Papa sails tomorrow , " said someone , miming her desperate tones . " Did n't you know that papa sails tomorrow ? " " Not sailing anyplace at all , " the father mumbled . " World is n't round . Drunk . Think I want to fall over the edge ? Think I  --  " " Oh , papa , " moaned the girl . " Wo n't someone help me to  --  " And she tugged again at the man 's arm  --  " to get him to bed . " A big man nearby boomed , " I 'll help you t'bed , me lass , but it wo n't be with your old father . Eh , mates ? " he cried , and the tavern echoed with laughter . The big man got up and went over to the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , taking hold of her arm . " Why do n't you forget this drunken slob of a father and  --  " Crack ! Her hand blurred at his cheek , struck it like a pistol shot . The big man blinked his eyes and grinned . " So you have spirit , do you ? Well , it 's more than I can say for that father of yours , too yellow and too drunk to carry out the Queen of Castile 's bid  --  " The hand flashed out again but this time the big man caught it in one of his own and twisted sideways against the girl , forcing her back against the table 's edge . " I like my girls to struggle , " he said , and the girl 's face went white as she suddenly let herself go limp in his arms . The man grinned . " Oh I like ' em limp , me lass . When they 're pretty as a rose , like you , who 's to care ? " " Papa ! " the girl screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blotting out the oil-lamp lights , the thick lips all but slavering .... * * * * * " Just a minute , man ! " Danny cried , striding boldly to them . Hardly pausing in his efforts to kiss the again struggling girl , the big man swatted back with one enormous arm and sent Danny reeling . Whoever he was , he was a popular figure . The laughter was still louder now . Everyone was having a great time , at Danny 's expense now . Danny crashed into a chair , upending it . A bowl of soup came crashing down , the heavy bowl splintering , the hot contents scalding him . He stood up and heard the girl scream . Instinctively , he grasped two legs of the heavy chair and hefted it . Then he sprinted back across the room . " Behind you , Pietro ! " a voice cried , and at the last moment the big man whirled and faced Danny , then lunged to one side , taking the girl with him . Danny could n't check his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down with a crash against the edge of the big plank table . The chair shattered in Danny 's arms . One leg flew up and struck the big man in the face , though , bringing blood just below the cheek bone . He bellowed in surprise and pain and came lumbering toward Danny . Danny was aware of the girl cowering to one side , aware that another of the chair 's legs was still grasped in his right hand . He was but a boy , he found himself thinking quickly , desperate . If the giant grabbed him , grabbed him just once , the fight would be over . The man was twice his size , twice his weight . Yet he had to do something to help the girl .... The giant came at him . The big arms lifted over the heavy , brutal face .... And Danny drove under them with the chair-leg , jabbing the tip of it against the man 's enormous middle . Pietro  --  for such was the man 's name  --  sagged a few inches , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But still , he got his great hands about Danny 's throat and began to squeeze . Danny saw the wood rafters , the window , a bargirl standing , mouth open , watching them , the drunken man and his daughter , then a blurry , watery confusion as his eyes went dim . He was conscious of swinging the club , of striking something , of extending the club out as far as it would go and then slamming it back toward himself , striking something which he hoped was Pietro 's head . He felt his mouth going slack and wondered if his tongue were hanging out . Exerting all his strength he struck numbly , mechanically , desperately with the chair-leg . And slowly , the constriction left his throat . Something struck against his middle , almost knocking him down . Something pushed against his legs , backing him against the table . He looked down . His eyes were watery , his throat burning . The giant Pietro lay , breathing stertorously , at his feet . A small hand grabbed his . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't  --  do n't even know who you are , but I want to thank you . I thank you for myself and the Queen , and God , senor . You better come quickly , with us . Does it hurt much ? " Danny tried to talk . His voice rasped in his throat . The girl squeezed his hand and together with her and the drunken man who was her father , he left the tavern . The giant Pietro was just getting up and shaking his fist at them slowly .... * * * * * It was a small top-floor room in an old waterfront building in the Spanish port of Palos . Or , Danny corrected himself , the Castillian port of Palos . Because , in this year of our Lord 1492 , Spain had barely become a unified country . " Are you feeling better , Martin Pinzon ? " the beautiful girl asked him . He had given the name he had heard , Martin Pinzon , as his own . The room was very hot . The August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl 's father was resting now , breathing unevenly . The girl 's name was Nina . One of the small caravels in her father 's three-ship fleet was named after her . Her full name was Nina Columbus . Nina brought another wet cloth and covered Danny 's swollen throat with it . " Does it hurt much ? " she said , and , for the tenth time , " we have no money to thank you with , senor . " " Any man would have  --  " " But you were the only one . The only  --  never mind . Martin , listen . I have no right to trouble you , but ... it 's father . Tomorrow is the second day of August , you see , and it is all over Palos that tomorrow he sails with the Queen 's charter .... " " Then if you 're worrying about that big man , Pietro , you can forget it . If you 're sailing , I mean . " " That 's just it , " Nina said desperately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , do you believe the world is round ? " Danny nodded very soberly . " Yes , Nina , " he told her softly . " The world is round . I believe it . " " My father does n't ! Funny , is n't it , Martin ? " she said in a voice which told him she did not think it was funny at all . " All Spain  --  and Genoa too  --  think that tomorrow morning my father , Christopher Columbus , will journey to the unexplored west confident that he will arrive , after a long voyage , in the East  --  when really my father , this same Christopher Columbus , lies here in a drunken stupor because he lacks the courage to face his convictions and ... oh , Martin ! " Her voice broke , her pretty face crumpled . She sobbed into her hands . Gently , Danny stroked her back . * * * * * " There now , take it easy , " he said . " Your father will sail . I know he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little Nina ? " " Yes . Oh yes , yes , yes ! " " He will sail . He will prove it and be famous . I know he will . " " Oh , Martin . You sound so sure of yourself . I wish I could ... " " Nina , listen . Your father will sail . " " You 'll help us you mean ? " " Yes . All right , I 'll help you . Now , get some sleep if you want to wake up and say goodbye to him in the morning . Because I 'll be getting him up before the sun to  --  " " Are you a sailing man too ? Are you going with him ? " " Well ... " " Wait ! Martin , I remember you now . Martin Pinzon . At the meeting of the organization to prove the Earth 's round shape . You ! You were there . And once , once when he was not drunk , father said that a Don Pinzon would command one of our three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears my name . Are you this Don Pinzon ? " Slowly , Danny nodded . He remembered his history now . The Nina had been commanded by one Don Pinzon , Don Martin Pinzon ! And he was now this Martin Pinzon , he , Danny Jones . Which meant he was going with Columbus to discover a new world ! A nineteen-year-old American youth going to witness the single most important event in American history .... " Yes , " Danny said slowly , " I am Don Pinzon . " " But  --  but you 're so young ! " Danny shrugged . " I have seen more of the world than you would believe , Nina . " " The Western Sea ? You have been out on the Western Sea , as far as the Canary Islands , perhaps ? " she asked in an awed voice . " I know the Western Sea , " he said . " Trust me . " She came very close . She looked long in his eyes . " I trust you , Martin . Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . I 'm going with you . I have to go with you . " " But a girl  --  " " He is my father . I love him , Martin . He needs me . Martin , do n't try to stop me . I want you to help me aboard , to see that he ... oh , Martin , you 'll have so much to do . Because the rest of our crew  --  some of them being hired even now by the three caravel pursers  --  will be a crew of cut-throats and ne'er-do-wells embarking into the unknown because they have utterly nothing to lose . Father needs you because the others wo n't care . " " The three caravels will sail west , " Danny told her . " Believe me , they 'll sail west . Now , get some sleep . " Her face was still very close . Her eyes filled with tears , but they were not tears of sadness . She took his cheeks in her hands and kissed him softly on the lips . She smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . His arms moved . They went around her , drew the softness of her close . She murmured something , but he did not hear it . His lips found hers a second time , fiercely . His hands her shoulder , her throat , her ... " Flat , " Columbus mumbled . " Flat . Abs'lutely flat . The Earth is  --  flat as a pancake .... " " Oh , Martin ! " Nina cried . * * * * * It was raining in the morning . A hard , driving rain , pelting down on the seaport of Palos . The three caravels floated side by side in the little harbor and a large , derisive crowd had gathered . The crowd erupted into noisy laughter when Columbus and his little party appeared on foot . " I need a drink , " Columbus whispered . " I ca n't go through with it . " " Father , " Nina said . " We 're with you . I 'm here . Martin is here . " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ! For yourself and for the world . Now , stand straight , father . They 're looking at you . They 're all looking at you . " Columbus , thought Danny . The intrepid voyager who had discovered a new world ! He smiled grimly . Columbus , the history books should have said , the drunken sot who did n't even have the courage to face his own convictions . They walked ahead through the ridiculing crowd . Danny 's throat was still sore . He was not frightened , though . He possibly was the only man in the crew who was not frightened . The others did n't care what their destination was , true : but they wanted to reach it alive . Danny knew the journey would end in success . The end of the journey meant nothing to him . It was written in history . It was ... Unless , he suddenly found himself thinking , I came back here to write it . He grinned at his own bravado . What would they have said in freshman psych  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whitney College , Virginia , U.S.A. , could have anything to do with the success or failure of Columbus ' journey . They reached the small skiff that would take them out to the tiny fleet of caravels . The crowd hooted and jeered. " ... going to drop off the edge of the world , Columbus . " " If the monsters do n't get you first . " " Or the storms and whirlpools . " Columbus gripped Nina 's hand . Martin-Danny took his other arm firmly and steered him toward the prow of the skiff . " Easy now , skipper , " Danny said . " I ca n't  --  " " There 's wine on the Santa Maria , " Danny whispered . " Much wine  --  to make you forget . Come on ! " " And I 'm going , father , " Nina said . " Whether you go or not . " " You ! " Columbus gasped . " A girl . You , going  --  " " With Martin Pinzon . If  --  if my own father ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you  --  " Danny began . " Be quiet , please , " she whispered as Columbus climbed stiffly into the skiff . " It may be the only way , Martin . He  --  he loves me . I guess I 'm the only thing he cares about . If he knows I 'm going . " " To the Santa Maria ! " Columbus told the rowers as Danny and Nina got into the skiff . " To the New World ! " cried Danny melodramatically . " What did you say ? " Nina asked him . His face colored . " I mean , to the Indies ! To the Indies ! " The skiff bobbed out across the harbor toward the three waiting caravels . Departure time had arrived . Two hours later , they were underway . * * * * * The sea was calm as glass , green as emerald . The three caravels , after a journey of several days , had reached the Canary Islands where additional provisions and fresh water were to be had . " This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain of islands . " This is as far as a mere man has a right to go . There is nothing further , ca n't you see ? Ca n't you ? " He was sober . Danny had come over in a skiff from the Nina to see that he remained sober at least for the loading and the departure . It was as if he , Danny , was going to preserve Columbus ' name for history  --  single-handed if necessary . " We will not go on , " Columbus said . " We 're going back . The only way to the Indies is around the Cape of Storms , around Africa . I tell you  --  " " That 's enough , father , " Nina said . " We ... " " I 'm in command here , " Columbus told them . It surprised Danny . Usually , the drunken sailor was not so self-assertive . Then it occurred to Danny that it was n't merely self-assertiveness : it was fear . Danny called over the mate , a one-legged man named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg leg . " You take orders from Columbus ? " Danny said . " Would you take orders from me ? " Juan shook his head , smiling . " You command aboard the Nina only , Martin Pinzon . I heard what the Captain said . If he wants to go back and give up this fool scheme , it 's all right with me . And you know the rest of the crew will say the same . " Nina looked at Danny hopelessly . She said , " Then , then it 's no use ? " Danny whispered fiercely , " Your father loves you very much ? " " Yes , but  --  " " And does n't want to see anything happen to you ? " " But  --  " " And believes the world is flat and if you sail far enough west you 'll fall off ? " " But I  --  " " Then you 're coming with me aboard the Nina ! " Columbus gasped , " What did you say ? " " She 's coming with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the western route to the Indies , we will . Right , Nina ? " he said , taking her hand and moving to where the rope-ladder dangled over the side of the Santa Maria to the skiff below . " Do n't take her from this deck , " Columbus ordered . Danny ignored him . " Don Juan ! " cried Columbus , and the peg-leg came toward Danny . " I 'm sorry , Don Martin , " he said , " but  --  " Still holding Nina 's hand , Martin stiff-armed him out of the way and ran for the side . Someone jerked the rope-ladder out of reach and someone else leaped on Martin . For , he was Martin now , Martin Pinzon . His own identity seemed submerged far below the surface , as if somehow he could look on all this without risking anything . He knew that he was merely a defense mechanism , to ward off fear : for , it was n't true . If Martin Pinzon were hurt , he would be hurt . He hurled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed in the sun . Martin-Danny ducked , felt the blade whizz by overhead . " Jump ! " Martin-Danny cried . " But I ca n't swim ! " " I can . I 'll save you . " It was Danny again , completely Danny . He felt himself arise to the surface , submerging Martin Pinzon . Because the Spaniard probably could n't swim at all , and if Danny made promises , it was Danny who must fulfill them . He squeezed Nina 's hand . He went up on the side  --  and over . The water seemed a very long way down . They hit it finally with a great splash . Down they went and down , into the warm murky green depths . Down  --  and finally up . Danny 's head broke surface . He was only yards from the skiff . He had never let go of Nina 's hand , but now he did , getting a lifeguard 's hold on her . He struck out for the skiff. * * * * * Fifteen minutes later , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny told the crew . " Is that correct ? " " Aye , sir , " said Don Hernan , the mate . " Even if Columbus tells you different ? " " Columbus ? " spat Don Hernan . " That drunkard is in command of the Santa Maria , not the Nina . We follow Martin Pinzon here . " " Even if I give one set of orders and Columbus another ? " " Even then , my commander . Yes . " " Then we 're sailing west , " Danny cried . " Up anchor ! Hurry . " " But I  --  " Nina began . " Do n't you see ? He thinks I 'm abducting you . Or he thinks I 'm sailing west with you to certain death . He will follow with the Santa Maria and the Pinta , trying to rescue you . And we 'll reach the Indies . Columbus will sail across the Western Sea to save his daughter , but what 's the difference why he 'll sail . The important thing is , Queen Isabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's making history . You see ? " " I ... I think so , " Nina said doubtfully . A heady wind sprang up . The square-rigged sails billowed . The Nina began to surge forward  --  into the unknown West . Tackle creaked aboard the nearby Santa Maria and Pinta . The two other caravels came in pursuit . But they wo n't catch us , Martin knew . They wo n't catch us until we reach  --  Hispaniola . And then , pursuit will be no more . Then , it will no longer matter and we 'll all be heroes .... * * * * * Which is the way it turned out  --  almost . The Santa Maria and Pinta pursued all through August and September and into October , but the Nina kept its slim lead . The ships were never out of sight of one another and once or twice Columbus even hailed them , imploring them to return to Spain with him . When they ignored him , his deep voice boomed to his own crew and the crew of the Pinta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was these words , Danny knew , that history would record . Not the others . One morning in October , he awoke with a start . Something had disturbed his sleep  --  something ... " Good morning , captain , " a voice said . He looked up . It was a giant of a man , with a hard face and brutal-looking eyes . He knew that face . Pietro ! The giant of the tavern . " But you  --  " " I was aboard all the time , my captain , " Pietro said . " An auxiliary rower . You never knew . " He said nothing else . He lunged at Martin 's bunk  --  for I 'm Martin again , Danny thought  --  a knife gleaming in his big hand . * * * * * Martin-Danny sat up , bringing the covers with him , hurling them like a cloak at Pietro . The giant 's knife-hand caught in the covers and Danny swung to his feet , shoving the big man . Pietro stumbled into the bunk , then lashed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt it grating across his ribs hotly , searingly . He staggered and almost fell , but somehow made it to the door and on deck . He needed room . Facing that knife in the close confines of the cabin , he was a dead man and knew it . He hit the stairs and headed for the deck . He reached the door  --  tugged . It held fast . He heard Pietro 's laughter , then threw himself to one side . The knife thudded into the wood alongside Danny 's shoulder . Then the door came open , throwing him back . He stumbled , regained his balance , plunged outside . With a roar , Pietro followed him , knife again in hand . Danny backed away slowly . Only a few crew members were on deck now , and a watch high up in the crow 's nest . The watch was crying in an almost-delirious voice : " Land , land ! Land ho-oo ! " But Martin-Danny hardly heard the words . Pietro came at him  --  Suddenly Don Hernan was in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then down and a knife arced toward Danny . He caught it by the haft , swung to face the giant . But , he thought , I do n't know how to use a knife . I 'm Danny Jones , I ... Pietro leaped , the knife down , held loosely at his side , underhanded , ready to slash and rip . Danny sidestepped and Pietro went by in a rush . Danny waited . Pietro came back carefully this time , crouching , balanced easily on the balls of his feet . For all his size , he fought with the grace of a dancer . Danny felt warm wetness where the blood was seeping from his ribs . Feet pounded as more of the crew came on deck in response to the watch 's delirious words . Instead of crowding at the prow , though , they formed a circle around Danny and Pietro . Danny thought : But I 'm the captain . The captain . They ought to help me ... they ... He knew though that they would not . They were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would apply even to the captain who had piloted them across an unknown ocean . Pietro came by , attempting to slash with his knife from outside . Danny moved quickly  --  not quick enough . The knife point caught his arm this time . He felt his hand go numb . His own knife clattered to the deck as blood oozed from his biceps . Once more Pietro charged him . Weaponless , Danny waited . Pietro was laughing , sure of himself  --  Careless . Danny slipped aside as Pietro brought the knife around in a wicked swipe . He spun with it and when he came around Danny was waiting for him . He drove his left fist into the great belly and his right to the big , bearded jaw . Pietro slumped , disbelief in his eyes . He swung the knife again but only succeeded in wrapping his giant arm around Danny . He bent his head , shook it to clear it of the sting of Danny 's blows . And Danny rabbit-punched him . Pietro went down heavily and someone shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wearily , Danny shook his head . He went with Nina to the rail and saw the green palm-fringed island of the New World . Nina smiled at him , then ripped something from what she was wearing and began to bandage his ribs , his arm . * * * * * They heard a splash . Danny looked around , saw Don Hernan and a member of the crew gazing serenely down . Pietro was down there , where they had tossed him . For a while the body floated , then the limbs splashed wildly as Pietro regained consciousness . He drifted back away from the ship . He went under , and came up . He went under again , and stayed under .... " The Indies , " Nina said . " The Indies , " Danny said . He did not make the distinction between east and west . They must learn for themselves . The Pinta and the Santa Maria came up alongside . All thoughts of pursuit were gone . Columbus waved . He was very close now on the deck of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something changed . Columbus was a new man now . He had been shamed . He had followed his daughter and Martin Pinzon across an unknown ocean and he was changed now . Somehow , Danny knew he could now make voyages on his own . " Martin , " Nina whispered . " They may say it was father . But it was you . I 'll know in my heart , it was you . " Danny nodded . She put her arm around his shoulder , and kissed him . He liked this slim girl  --  he liked her immensely , and it was n't right . She was n't his , not really . She was Martin Pinzon 's . He let the Spaniard come to the surface , willed his own mind back and down and away . She 's all yours , Pinzon , he told the other mind in his body . She  --  and this world . I 'm a  --  stranger here . But once more he kissed Nina , fiercely , with passion and longing . " Goodbye , my darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He let Martin Pinzon take it from there . " Hello , " said Martin Pinzon . " I mean , hello forever , darling . " She laughed . " Goodbye to your bachelorhood , you mean . " " Yes , " he said . " Yes . " But it was Martin Pinzon talking now . Completely Martin Pinzon . He was back in his grand-uncle 's basement . He was in the trunk and he felt stiff . Mostly , his right arm and the right ribs felt stiff . He felt his shirt . It was caked with blood . Proof , he thought . If I needed proof . What happened to Pinzon happened to me . He stood up . He felt weak , but knew he would be all right . He knew about Columbus now . At first , a weak drunkard . But after the first voyage , thanks to Martin Pinzon and Nina , an intrepid voyager . For history said Columbus would make four voyages to the New World  --  and four he would make . Danny went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trunk was Danny 's now , the time trunk . And he would use it again , often . He knew that now , and it was wrong to deflate a dream . Columbus was a hero . He would never say otherwise again . THE END
