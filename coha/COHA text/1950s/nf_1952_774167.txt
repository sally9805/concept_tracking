txt  | He made a fix on these , the Turtle Hills , which are actually on the 100th meridian and nearly three hundred and fifty miles beyond the westernmost point he himself had reached . For the Sioux with whom he wintered and the miscellany of tribes he met at Prairie du Chien and along Lake Superior told him many true things . He heard much about New Mexico , including the Villasur massacre . ( Spanish horses were now shod with silver . ) But what counted most of all was the Shining Mountains , a conception of which Carver managed to work out . He concluded that they were three thousand miles long and ran from Mexico northward , east of California , and ended at about 47 ? or 48 ? N. ( To provide comfortable space for the sea-level Strait of Anian . ) They separated the waters that fell into the Gulf of Mexico from those that fell into the Gulf of California , and the Mississippi watershed from that of the Pacific . They were , in short , the Continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly phrased by Sir Humphrey Gilbert . Most ( but not all ) formulations of theoretical geography had to assume some kind of fundamental divide and it was especially necessary to conceptions of the River of the West and to the teleology by which the eighteenth century 's right reason imposed a beautiful symmetry on North America . But Carver was the first man who ever expressed a conception of the Continental Divide that approximately corresponded to the actual one . The trouble was that he had two sets of Shining Mountains which he understood as one . One supplied the actual parting of waters , he heard about it in reports of Indians who had heard about it , and he did exceeding well to analyze their reports as he did : these were the Rocky Mountains . The other set was the Turtle Hills , which he took to be only a few miles away and which for him not only separate the Mississippi drainage from that of the Pacific but also separate it from the rivers that " fall into Hudson 's Bay or the waters that communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific and Hudson Bay were the Northwest Passage , which he identified as the Strait of Anian . The same bay whence it leads eastward holds the mouth of the two-thousand-mile-long Oregon , which has rounded the northern end of the Shining Mountains after flowing from the country of the Sioux through  | " plains that according to their account are unbounded and probably terminate on the coast of the Pacific Ocean . " That Carver was able to get so much right which Verendrye did not shows that the accretion of knowledge had been considerable , but his cardinal misconception diverts him into apocalypse . The mountains are called Shining because of an " infinite number of chrystal stones of an amazing size with which they are covered and which , when the sun shines full on them , sparkle so as to be seen at a very great distance . " Beyond them lies the future , waiting for new Columbuses and Raleighs to open their incalculable wealth to mankind . Carver is clear that it will be American mankind : La Salle 's Garden of the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical answers and European and American cartographers adopted them . But far beyond this still fogbound part of the world map , out in the Pacific Ocean and along its bounds , a new great age of discovery dissolved away huge areas of ignorance as the 1760 's ran out and the ' 70 's came on . Western man learned much about the earth he intended to organize when the British Empire challenged Spain for the Spanish ocean , and when Spain found in Charles III a king who gave promise of meeting the challenge and restoring the glory of the great reigns . Fundamental in this harvesting was the fact that various sciences had achieved finer accuracies . In 1744 Cassini de Thury presented to the French Academy the first eighteen sheets of an outline map of France , a triangulated , checked , dependable map such as there had never before been of any moderately large area anywhere . Various prime meridians were fixed and their land relationships examined . A century of effort by gifted men to make possible the determination of longitude at sea reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more brilliant one with his great Number Four in 1759 . Such advances as these are the bench mark of a new era . Though unknown areas of great extent remained , cartographers were mapping the Pacific Ocean far more accurately than before , and now they would begin to get the western coast of the United States located . But they would not refine the Far West beyond Carver 's Shining Mountains and River Oregon . Even before he wrote his book his fellow colonials who were  | in the fur trade had amassed empirical knowledge that revealed the falsity of his logical derivations . But their knowledge was of the Northwest , not as yet of the West . By 1766 Canadian traders had reached the southern part of Verendrye 's domain , Lake Winnipeg , the Red River , the Assiniboine , Lake Winnipegosis . They proved the soundness of his commercial strategy and , like him , cut deeply into the Hudson 's Bay Company trade in this plains area . They went on to the Saskatchewan country , as Verendrye had done , and learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strategic portages . One " Franceway " was at The Pas in 1769 , James Finlay at Nipawin ( 150 miles upstream from it ) in 1769 , and Thomas Corry at The Pas and Cedar Lake as advance agent for the formidable Frobisher brothers in 1771 . In this short time they deprived the Company of so great a bulk of the furs it had been getting that it was at last coerced into changing its hallowed and by now solidified system . In spite of very great difficulties of supply and transport , they were taking the trade to the interior of the great fur country , as Verendrye and his successors had done . They were getting such returns that a couple of seasons would make a man rich and the total return of what was so far only a few traders was notably increasing the capital wealth of Montreal . Since Henday the Company had sent out many of its servants as public relations officers , to travel with the Indians , create goodwill , and encourage them to come to the Bay . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it had to do what the great Radisson had wanted it to do from the beginning . In 1773 it sent its Matthew Cocking to make a circuit of the interior and report on the activities of the Pedlars and the next year it took the revolutionary step at last and packed off Samuel Hearne to build the first post it had ever had far inland . On the Saskatchewan the Pedlars learned about a country even wealthier in furs and prepared to move into it . So they set up still another deadly competition with the Company , passed the farthest French penetrations , and arrived at new things . North of the Saskatchewan the dry plains ended and the forest  | began again , a forest thickly sown with streams , swamps , and lakes . North ( and northeast ) of the forest belt stretched the tundras , whose map looks like the Milky Way , all lakes , all streams , all muskeg , all barrens . Winters lengthened to seven , eight , nine months . The summer nights were only twilight . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms of mosquitoes grew thicker and deadlier till you longed for the terrible cold that would put an end to them . There were new Indians , a medley of Athapascan tribes , the babiche people who made from deer and caribou hide long skeins of infinitely versatile rawhide cord and who were masters of travel by snowshoe and sledge . The first whom the Pedlars met were those whom the Hudson 's Bay Company called " the Northern Indians , " the Chipewyans . Beyond them were tribes and subtribes whose names are so confused that they can seldom be confidently identified , such names as Red copper Knives , Hares , Dog Ribs , Caribous , Quarrelers , Beavers , Slaveys . They were a shy , baffling people . They seemed timorous and seemed to grow more timorous farther north . Yet they were violent and murderous ( though never toward white men ) and their wars were revolting . The squalor of their barren country made them seem revolting in many ways , but their adaptation to that land was superb . If they were primitive among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and today they live much the same kind of life they lived before the white man in a country which he has never been able to occupy . The snowshoed Bedouins of the West , the Crees , had been raiding them for a century , irresistible with Hudson 's Bay Company iron and guns , shoving them farther into the drowned lands and selling them goods at a ferocious markup . The Chipewyans and others on the southern fringe had gradually become direct customers of the Company , paddling the endless distance through the maze of waters to the Churchill River and down it to Fort Churchill at its mouth . So they became middlemen for the still higher tribes . The goods they took back with them worked farther into the desolation , to Lake Athabaska , Slave Lake , beyond the 65th parallel , and on toward the Arctic Ocean . From the base of the lower Saskatchewan the Canadians began to work toward this country . They were so far from  | Montreal that now it took two seasons to get the goods to the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be made in a single season and they had to work out a way of forwarding goods from an advance depot . On the plains no one ever lacked food for long but game was scarce in the northern forest and at the posts there was no food but fish all the long winter and but little else at any time . The posts had to be built on lakes where fish were abundant and the garrisons had to spend the autumn seining them , mostly whitefish but whatever else there might be , carp , pike , lake trout , and the huge sturgeon of the region . " The freshwater hog , " David Thompson called the sturgeon , explaining that it was abundant only in muddy waters . " Whatever is not required for the day is frozen and laid by in a hoard , and with all care is seldom more than enough for the winter . " There was seldom quite enough , in fact , and every winter at every post beyond the buffalo country there were periods of very short rations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , for the short season when the streams were open was a frenzy of transporting furs , goods , and supplies between the depots and the posts . ( A new kind of food for the canoe fleets had to be found and a system of distributing it developed . ) Travel was by snowshoe and dog sledge , under threat of blizzards and sudden drops of temperature from the normal thirty below to sixty or more . But one welcomed this necessary business of intercommunication for life at the posts was monotonous to the verge of the wilderness anxiety for which the American language has found such names as snow fever , cabin fever , moonwalking , and the like . A hundred miles through gales and snowstorms was a small price for the sight of a different log hut , the sound of English words , and a chance to get drunk with a man whose thought ran in the same images .

Rivals who would bully , beat up , or take potshots at one another would also carefully forward through the snow whatever London magazine of three years ago might have turned up in a bundle from York Factory or Grand Portage . Indeed the frequency of conversion to the  | Christian life among these casehardened men is to be explained by the escape from boredom , world-emptiness , and drunken Indians provided by the King James Bible . They came to hate their voyageurs not only for their slovenliness but for their acceptance of the wilds , their high spirits , and their cordial if verminous brotherhood with the Indians . They themselves had no trouble with Indians this side of the Gros Ventres and Blackfeet ( so long , that is , as they were sober ) for good customer-relations had to be preserved and the Indians were cordial to the providers of goods . But most of them despised the customers and treated even the women they bought like foul animals .

Thursday October 10 . This is the Vermonter Daniel Harmon , who for a long time postponed the convention , from qualms which few besides him ever felt . This day a Canadian 's daughter , a girl of about fourteen years of age , was offered to me ; and after mature consideration concerning the step which I ought to take , I have finally concluded to accept her , as it is customary for all gentlemen who remain for any length of time in this part of the world to have a female companion , with whom they can pass their time more socially and agreeably than to live a lonely life , as they must do if single . If we can live in harmony together my intention now is to keep her as long as I remain in this uncivilized part of the world , and when I return to my native land I shall endeavor to place her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can pass the remainder of her days much more agreeably than it would be possible for her to do were she to be taken down into the civilized world , to the manners , customs and language of which she would be an entire stranger . Her mother is of the tribe of Snare Indians , whose country lies along the Rocky Mountains . The girl is said to have a mild disposition and an even temper , which are qualities very necessary to make an agreeable woman and an affectionate partner . They were a tough breed in a tough business . The trade was hardening into the most brutal practices , but if they could stand theft , hijacking , and occasional murder , their finances could not . The new conditions required concentrations of capital that could underwrite credits of three or even four years , investment in sloops for the Great Lakes which lowered the overhead on freight , larger payrolls , and the storage of goods  | and food in depots for the high country . But the price wars of competitors were threatening them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profitable business but the Northwest demanded the organization and methods of big business . The Canadians stumbled toward the solution , the first American trust , in great part by extemporizing small co-operations against the Hudson 's Bay Company . The Company was both reluctant and ill prepared to meet the competition from Montreal that in the early 1770 's was getting its best customers and its best furs . It was staid , handcuffed by tradition , imprisoned in a rigorous caste-slavery that gave its servants no incentive to be enterprising , with few wilderness men and entirely without rivermen . Its first reaction to the Canadian invasion of the Saskatchewan was to increase its advertising there , to send more agents to persuade the Indians to scorn the Pedlars and resume trading at York Factory for auld lang syne . It was wasted effort and the Company i had to imitate the Pedlars . The remarkable explorations of Samuel Hearne were part of the new adaptation but at first a temporizing part . The first effort was to try to increase the trade in the far North and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yet been made . His principal objective was to drum up more business but he was also to reach the Northwest Passage if it existed there , and to find a big river about which the Company had long been hearing , a river of unknown direction but apparently rich in virgin copper . After two failures Hearne made a third journey which in 1771 took him to the rumored river , the Coppermine , and across the Arctic Circle , down to the Arctic Ocean , and on the return trip to Great Slave Lake . It was a tremendous feat . It practically proved that there was no Northwest Passage but some time passed before anyone who was interested understood , even , that it narrowed the possibilities . It accomplished little for the Company 's business and the Pedlars had to be met . In 1774 the Company sent Hearne to meet them , in the heart of the country they had taken over . On Pine Island Lake , between the Saskatchewan ( which , having changed its channel now flows through it ) and Cumberland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . With the Pedlars all  | about it , the Company was for a long time still outmaneuvered , outguessed , and out-traded but the establishment of Cumberland House marks the beginning of what was to become the most violent competition in fur trade history . It also hastened the big combination that would be called the North West Company . But something intervened . Thomas and Joseph Frobisher , who had already done a rich business in the Northwest , had solved some of the problems of further advance , and were beginning to solve others , spent the winter of 1773 ? 74 on Cumberland Lake , not far from the site where Hearne was to build Cumberland House . The next spring , having arranged to be supplied by associates in the plains country , Joseph Frobisher went on north up the Sturgeon-Weir River and the long crooked lakes at its upper end to the carrying place which led to the Churchill River . Here he met Indians in large numbers coming down from the North to descend the Churchill for their annual trade at Fort Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable a business with them that from then on the carrying place was called Portage du Traite , Trade Portage . In 1775 two Americans , Alexander Henry and Peter Pond , abandoned the Great Lakes trade where they had both been eminently successful , and joined the increasing company on the Saskatchewan . They were first-rate men and Pond was rather more than that , a man who was to cast a long shadow and initiate great actions . They met at Lake Winnipeg , traveled together toward Saskatchewan , and presently fell in with the Frobishers . Cumberland House had been built , the Hudson 's Bay Company was in the Pedlar 's best territory , and it would not do to cut each other 's throats ? hence the first combination . ( Pond did not join it this year but went to Lake Dauphin on his own . ) Henry and the Frobishers pooled their goods and agreed not to cut prices . . . . Henry lists some of those prices . A beaver skin would buy ten musket balls or half a pint of gunpowder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroud blanket ten , a trade musket twenty . Compared with Mackinac prices these are , except for the musket , unholy . Henry set about mastering the conditions of the plains and the northern forest . He had an adventurous winter , with mass  | drunks for the customers and a couple of grueling journeys . In the spring he visited some Assiniboins on the plains and then accompanied the Frobishers to the vital Portage du Traite , between Saskatchewan and Churchill waters . They went on past it to Lake Isle-a-la-Crosse and presently met some northern Indians . They had come from a country far beyond any the white men had heard of , beyond the reach of rumor and guess , all the way from Lake Athabaska . They talked about a previously unheard of river which came down from the Stony Mountains , the Rockies , and they had a name for it ; it was the great Peace River . They said that beyond the mountains was a big salt lake , the Pacific . They went on to say that from the lake into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sea , but whether the same sea as the one beyond the mountains they did not know . They were decorous people , and a little sad . They asked for rum but wanted it diluted , lest the young men get too drunk . It had already been diluted to an appalling profit but Henry could bring himself to meet their wishes . First appointing guards to stay sober and protect this lordly bringer of iron and red milk , they had a quiet , rather melancholy two-day drunk . Then they traded their skins and slipped away into their brown , barren land . Thomas Frobisher stayed here , preparing to go on to the distant Lake Athabaska . Joseph Frobisher and Henry turned back , heading for Grand Portage and next year 's goods . The day they started out was July 4 1776 . Beaver Lake , the Saskatchewan , Lake Winnipeg , Lake of the Woods ? all that long way east . Their start was late but they reached Grand Portage on October 15 , a tremendous trip whose speed was made possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Lake of the Woods that they heard the world had changed again . The Indians there told Henry " that some strange nation had entered Montreal , taken Quebec , killed all the English , and would certainly be at the Grand Portage before we arrived there . On my remarking to Mr. Frobisher that I suspected the Bastonnais had been doing some mischief in Canada , the Indians directly exclaimed , Yes , that is the name , Bastonnais . ' " The American people had become the Americans and had  | made a nation . As a nation they were fighting a war to establish in politics the independence they had achieved in fact . As imperialists they were breaking up the British Empire in North America to organize an empire of their own from its fragments . What Henry heard about at Lake of the Woods was their capture of Montreal , the center of the fur trade , and their first attempt to conquer Canada .  | THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS for Trade and Plantations formally represented to the ministry : that " the great object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve and extend the commerce , navigation , and manufactures of this kingdom . " They pointed out that His Majesty 's Proclamation of 1763 , to which certain moot questions might properly be referred , was intended to keep the colonies in subordination to and dependence on the mother country and to make sure that settlement should extend no farther west than the kingdom 's trade should reach . No one could have more completely or more justly summarized the mercantilist principle that had opened a cleavage line across the British Empire in North America . The Commissioners proceeded to exemplify the insensitiveness to colonial realities that characterized the government of Great Britain in good King George 's glorious days . They took judicial notice that there was important capital in Montreal and a rich trade in the Indian country . So , the extension of the fur trade depends entirely upon the Indians being undisturbed in the possession of their hunting grounds and . . . all colonizing does in its nature , and must in its consequences , operate to the prejudice of that branch of commerce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing to take the scalp of the Commissioner who wrote the report , must have felt that the Lord had delivered his adversary into his hands when he read the further admonition , " Were they the Indians driven from their forests , the peltry trade would  | decrease and it is not impossible that worse savages would take refuge in them . " Colonial savages . The Commissioners ' report was of 1772 . Two years later , following hard upon the " Intolerable Acts " that undertook to punish an already rebellious Massachusetts , the policy thus formulated became law in the Quebec Act . In the provisions that secured to seventy thousand Canadians the Catholic establishment and their inherited legal institutions , this Act was as enlightened a measure as any that a British government has ever adopted . ( Even so , it gave the rebels of Massachusetts , whose Protestantism had the highest voltage , a propaganda beyond all price . ) But the rest of it was consummate folly . Ratifying the Proclamation of 1763 , it decreed the persistence of Yesterday in an era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Empire to the support of furs as opposed to land , it triply sealed the West to settlement and to speculation , and it legislated mercantilism as the reef on which colonial expansion would be shattered . Great Britain undertook to confine the colonies east of the mountains . That was precisely the policy that had forced Great Britain to erase the French Empire from the map of North America . The Quebec Act was a decree that the motion of the stars should cease . In its final form it passed the Lords in June 1774 . In that same month a Pennsylvanian named James Harrod at the head of thirty men went up the Kentucky River , crossed over toward the head of Salt River , and began to build the stockade and cabins of the first settlement west of the mountains . The ghost of La Salle need no longer revisit the glimpses of the moon : the people who were to fulfill his imperial dream had reached the Great Valley . All the way across the continent there would be an advance screen of long hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create would not come from furs . These were settlers , farmers , builders of communities . Throughout the war that now broke out they kept following where Harrod ( and Henderson , Boone , and Logan ) had led . The war splashed their wilderness stations with their blood but they kept coming , mostly to Kentucky , and at least twenty-five thousand of them were settled west of the mountains when it ended . From the beginning it was a world war . And from the be-  | ginning the West was the stake of four empires . Great Britain , which had risen to world dominance in 1763 , might be reduced to a second-class power , and if it lost North America might lose India too . The France of Louis XVI hastened its own downfall when it lined up beside the United States , made official the war it was already fighting unofficially , and in February 1778 signed a treaty of alliance . The aid which Spain was supplying to the United States was almost as vital as that which came from France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern flank of Spain , which was historically the great colonial power of the Americas , a colonial revolution and the threat of an expanding nation . Spain could tolerate neither , but first things first . The United States could be used as a weapon to break British colonial power ? and in the process it would conveniently exhaust itself . So there were Spanish harbors for American privateers and credit for munitions . Arms and especially powder went up the Mississippi from New Orleans , up the Ohio , on to Fort Pitt where it was invaluable to the border defense , and some went over the mountains to the Continental Army . At the arch of the continent the village of St. Louis dominated the Indian trade south of the Great Lakes . Spain had a lieutenant-governor there , it had Laclede and Chouteau , and it had the sense to adopt French methods of dealing with Indians and to let the emigre French manage the frontiers . If British traders illegally ( though with the approval of Spanish officials when money was short ) reached toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Spanish went up the Mississippi and traded to the eastward with British tribes . In 1774 Peter Pond had noted at Prairie du Chien " a Large Colection from Eavery Part of the Misseppey . . . . Even from Orleans Eight Hundred Leagues Below us. " 1 When the war came activity on this commercial frontier was intensified and Americans soon arrived to help out . Meanwhile there were southern Indians to incite against scattered loyalist settlements , and when groups of American rangers on the same errand came within reach they could count on the Spanish for sanctuary and supplies . In 1779 Spain entered the war against Great Britain ? but not as an ally of the United States ? and the attack on the British Empire became overt .  | Both France and Spain intervened in the War of the Revolution for realistic reasons of imperial policy : not to help the Americans make the United States but to halt British expansion . There was no intention that the United States should long survive the war : politics hath bubbles as the water has and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If it should remain an independent nation at the end of the war , it would be a weak one too and it could not last . It would break up into its component parts and disappear , or it would attach itself to a stronger power , or when the next war came it could be picked off . And imperial strategy committed the French and Spanish to the same principle as that of the British : the United States must not extend into the heartland , the West must not be American . The military actions in the West were microscopic and exceedingly important . They were not decisive in American survival but the very nature of American nationalism turned on them . So did the area of the American empire ; so did the greatest national wealth the United States was to have . Here was an action in delicate equipoises , constantly oscillating . Extemporized organizations of frontiersmen , ranging across great distances and seldom acting for very long at a time , provided just enough weight to turn and keep the balance American . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans undertook to make allies of such Western tribes as they could get and to buy the neutrality of the others . The British had many advantages : the posts and forts all the way to Lake Superior and beyond , possession of the entire lake frontier , unmatchable quantities of trade goods and munitions , and what counted fully as much , the policy of the Quebec Act which guaranteed to the Indians the country between the Ohio and the Lakes . The United States was now the threat that the British had been , and British Canada the promise of security that the French had been . The tribes clearly understood the Quebec Act and had learned that the Americans meant land companies and land companies meant extinction . So the tribes north of the Ohio gave American legendry the belief that the word " Kentucky " means " dark and bloody ground . " Before the war ended most of them were raiding the Kentucky stations and reaching on to the Tennessee country  | and the Wilderness Road . The most tireless were the Shawnees . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to characterize the American frontier murdered their chief Cornstalk , and from then on they were never to be at peace with the United States till Wayne broke the last confederacy in Washington 's second term . The Delawares also chose the losing side as was their custom , though they too began as allies of the Americans . Piankeshaws , Miamis , and Illinois raided with both tribes . They were directed by the British commandants of the Western posts , especially Henry Hamilton at Detroit , whom the Americans probably hated more than any other British officer . The British decision to use Indian auxiliaries in the general war ? a foolish blunder for it meant a net loss to them and much worse to the Indians ? at once involved the far tribes too . Ottawas , Chippewas , Hurons fought in the border campaigns and took the ancient war road down the Lakes and the St. Lawrence to fight in the East . So , though in smaller numbers and as pro-British factions of divided tribes , did Sauks , Foxes , Potawatornis , Menominees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon in the East , though a terrible one , but they became the principal British I. force in the effort to hold , subdue , and extend the West . The decisive stay to that effort was provided by one of the suddenly disclosed geniuses shaped to the need and the hour whom the American Revolution was able to supply in such amazing numbers . He was George Rogers Clark , a Virginian , a neighbor and friend of Thomas Jefferson 's . He acted as a military officer of Virginia , not of the United States . In fact he was working to bring Richard Henderson 's Kentucky government , Transylvania , under Virginia jurisdiction when he perceived that the West was in danger of being lost and that there was a way to save it . It was 1778 , the year following Burgoyne 's surrender and the dolorous winter of Valley Forge . Twenty-six years old , a lieutenant colonel of Virginia , promised more money than was ever appropriated for him and authorized to raise more troops than would join him , Clark set out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had four companies , one hundred and seventy-five frontiersmen . News of the French alliance reached them just before they started and they shot  | the falls of the Ohio during a total eclipse of the sun ? it was just that histrionic . On the night of July 4 they captured the small post of Kaskaskia without a fight , Cahokia followed , and they had won the Illinois . Its French inhabitants , who had been but indifferent subjects of Great Britain , gladly became Americans . Moreover , Clark had made contact with the Spanish at St. Louis , not yet declared enemies of Great Britain but at his service . Munitions and supplies came from them only , and the expenses of his occupation were thereafter mostly paid by the Spanish and mostly with private capital . . . . The trader and ex-soldier Francis Vigo , who spent a sizable fortune to maintain the conquest , has been memorialized with a number of statues , and heirs of the speculators who bought up his claim against the United States were paid off ninety-eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to a council . In spite of frantic British efforts to make it futile some four thousand of them gathered at Cahokia in August . Most of them were factions of tribes that also had pro-British factions but they represented formidable power . Clark proved to have genius at dealing with Indians . Not Perrot , Duluth , or Frontenac himself had achieved a more brilliant success than that won by Clark 's speech of martial flattery , scorn , defiance , and invitation to ally themselves with the new-risen star , the victorious Americans . " Hear , " his own note of the peroration runs : all the Clarks were inspired spellers , " hear is a Blody belt and a white one take which you please behave like men . " They took the white belt . That he was able to make American or at least Spanish-American Indians out of the Sauks and Foxes ( who may be thought of as by now a single tribe ) proved to have decisive importance , and it was only less important that the majority of Potawatomis stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other tribes came to the council too , but he did not win many of them over . Nevertheless his success was so impressive that minorities along the vital route of the Wabash River , where the British had abandoned the commanding position at Vincennes , changed their allegiance . In two months Clark had permanently changed the align-ment of forces in the West . He had also forestalled a grandiose  | British plan of invading it from several directions at once . At Detroit Hamilton , " the hair-buyer , " had been sending Indians on raid after raid against the Kentucky border.2 ( It was now that the three renegade Girty brothers , of whom Simon became the most notorious , began to earn their reputation for savagery . ) He had planned a campaign against Fort Pitt , the way to which had been opened by the failure of an American foray in the direction of Detroit . He himself did not have enough force for it but he hoped to bring to his support the loyalist bands that were scouring the Tennessee country , such Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fluctuating war in the Carolina piedmont . The loss of the Illinois , which established the Americans on the right flank of his invasion , could not be tolerated . Summoning the Northern Indians , Hamilton moved with negligent slowness on the key post , Vincennes . He occupied it December 17 ? Clark had been too weak to garrison it ? and then dispersed most of his force , planning a spring campaign to clean out the countryside and confident that he was invulnerable during the winter . Hamilton was thus poised on the frail and vital line that connected the United States with its imperial frontier . The winter proved less than a safeguard for him . A hundred and eighty miles stretched between Kaskaskia and Vincennes , a third of it " drowned " with the winter floods of prairie rivers . In as resolute a feat of leadership as our military annals contain , through two and a half weeks of February 1779 Clark led across this wilderness of mire and ice a small force that was half American and half Illinois French . Never warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loyal inhabitants of the town they had come to recapture , they completely surprised Hamilton and captured him and his whole force . That did it . On the far frontier American power and prestige could now withstand anything brought against them . When Spain entered the war , the British undertook to invade Louisiana and capture St. Louis . The movement was based on Mackinac and utilized the Sioux , whose firm attachment to the British was to be a conditioning influence in the West for the next quarter-century . Besides Sioux there were Ottawas and Chippewas in the force that was assembled ; it was so impressive that the Sauks and Foxes were pressured into neutrality and a few  | of them persuaded , with a scattering of Menominees and Potawatomis , to join up . Moving south , the Indians and the small British contingent captured various Spanish detachments , took a few scalps , and appeared before St. Louis , where the commandant had dug trenches and built some crude fortifications . On the morning of May 26 1780 they made their attack but with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and became a retreat . This failure of a well-planned effort , which had sufficient strength to overwhelm the town , has never quite been explained but may have been due to the Sauks and Foxes . Except for brief periods they had always been enemies of the Sioux , they had become partisans of the Spanish , and they had been impressed by the Americans . They simply omitted to fight and this appears to have deterred the Sioux , who had any Indians ' reluctance to storm fortifications . Across the Mississippi a parallel move on Cahokia was stopped short by the arrival from downriver of Clark and some of his men . The invaders hurried northward , burning what they could and taking some scalps . This outcome so discredited the British that their influence collapsed . Upper Louisiana remained Spanish , which is to say permeable by the United States . The commandant at Mackinac , anticipating a counterattack , withdrew the fort from the mainland to the island , where it remained thereafter.3 Thus the British effort to encircle the United States from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the geopolitical ground plan , and the Spanish now undertook to effect the same strategy . Their riposte to the attack on St. Louis , a brilliantly executed raid up the Illinois River , was in consideration not of the military present but of the imperial future . They were asserting Spanish sovereignty east of the Mississippi , that is eastward from Louisiana . Spanish policy was necessarily committed to the theorem that the United States did not extend west of the mountains . If the British colonies had ever had even a shadowy claim to the Mississippi Valley , the theorem ran , the Proclamation of 1763 and the Quebec had extinguished it . To support the policy the government of Louisiana seized a number of places on the east bank of the Mississippi ; then it made a conclusive demonstration by capturing West Florida . The full extent of the claim thus affirmed , sovereignty over the  | entire Mississippi Valley , might not be made good during the war or at the peace settlement when it ended . But Spain was nevertheless established on both banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every imperial thinker assumed , implied control of the American empire and would very likely destroy the United States . A friction bound to be deadly was thus insured . When hostilities ended , the Spanish policy was continued by other means : the incitement of Indian trouble along the southern border to keep the West weak and conspiratorial activity to detach it from the United States . The remainder of the war in the West was an episodic seesaw , a stalemate determined by Canadian and American geography . The Americans were never able to make the sustained attempt on Detroit which would have split Canada in half , might have given them all of it , and would certainly have changed the conditions of the western and northwestern fur trade . The British were never able to make the reciprocal attempt on Fort Pitt that would have detached the Vest and enabled them to combine with the loyalists of the South and East . The Indian fighting that continued nearly everywhere had no effect on the outcome . After the victory at St. Louis saved the Illinois , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in Kentucky , in time to take a strenuous part in turning back another invasion by the British and their Indians . A year after the surrender of Cornwallis , he led an expedition against the Shawnees at Chillicothe that held the central frontier against the last raids boiling out of Detroit . He had built a fort at the falls of the Ohio , the future site of Louisville , and there he was , in command of a small body of troops which fluctuated in size and was nearly impotent of itself but constituted a force in being , a nucleus round which the frontier militia could always form . There he was , a curious resultant of many energies that all but neutralized one another and yet were just threat enough to the Canadian West . Nothing much was said about him at the peace conference but everybody there and elsewhere knew where he was .  | Lord North 's " Oh God , it is all over ! " when word of the surrender at Yorktown reached him was right . The end had come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun in 1607 . Immediately the West exerted its imperial leverage . Washington began to plan a campaign west of the mountains . As the commissioners for peace prepared to meet at Paris the common interest of three enemies was manifest to everyone . The United States had proved that a nation existed but the three empires were resolved that there must not be a fourth one . Washington might cross the mountains but the nation must not . And a Kentuckian went to Pennsylvania , loaded a boat with flour , floated it off down the Monongahela , passed Fort Pitt with the shades of Contrecoeur and Braddock watching impassively , passed the falls of the Ohio , drifted into the river of De Soto and Jolliet and La Salle , reached the New Orleans Iberville had founded , and exchanged his flour there for furs . He took the furs to Havana , exchanged them for ' he entucky , e cIzant  | sugar , sold the sugar in Philadelphia , and crossed the mountains to Kentucky . That was why there would be a fourth empire : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty might come out of Paris , there would be no settlement of the continental strategy till 1804 . But the Virginia roads converged on Cumberland Gap and the village of Wheeling , and the Pennsylvania roads on Pittsburgh . The buffalo began to leave Kentucky . John Jay , straight from the frustrate humiliation of trying to negotiate with Spain ; John Adams , feverish with suspicion of the British that only his distrust of the French kept short of explosion ; Franklin , far subtler than either and thinking of more extensive territory than they dared to , thinking indeed of all Canada as the great prize of the war ? the American commissioners were a strange and striking trio . But however diverse they were , all three had beyond the margin of consciousness the unconscious feel of the continent , the continental will , that shaped a demand . And they set a precedent that has held for American diplomacy ever since : they got more than there was any realistic expectation the United States would be able to get . Their triumph was possible because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger United States meant a weaker France intersected the belated British recognition that the United States , even though independent , remained the principal market for British manufactures . They got the whole West ? all the way to the Mississippi . With the West the United States got the most cohesive force of nationalism and got its empire . The French and Spanish Empires were left with no weapon but conspiracy to use against it till there should be another war . Nobody doubted that another war would come tolerably soon . There was a period during the negotiations when the 45th parallel might have been made the boundary . . . . That would have made the Michigan peninsula Canadian and the Ontario peninsula American , and would have satisfied the powerful interest of Montreal by keeping the canoe route west from Lake Superior entirely free from our control . . . . Many considerations made it instead the line of the Lakes and from the end of Lake Superior the established route , " the water communica-  | tion , " to Lake of the Woods . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism had agreed on the " natural channel " ? though the United States got a valuable , and to Montreal very disturbing , dividend in that Grand Portage lay south of this line . Here , however , ignorance of geography took over . The terms agreed on were that the United States was to extend to Louisiana . Louisiana was undefined except that its northeast corner must be the source of the Mississippi . How , then , to fix the western boundary of the United States ? David Thompson ascribes to Peter Pond , whom he calls " an unprincipled man of a violent character , " an intention to injure his former associates in the fur business by advising the American commissioners to insist that the Mississippi lay due west of Lake of the Woods.4 He appears to have remembered something that never occurred and the true explanation was the insufficiency of the maps , though in fact no one knew where the source of the Mississippi was . John Adams said that " it was the Mitchell 's map upon which was marked out the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Mitchell 's " Map of the British and French Dominions in North America , " originally published in 1755 but almost entirely unchanged in the edition used at the peace conference . On the whole it was the best map that had yet been drawn but Mitchell showed the Mississippi more than two hundred and fifty miles west of Lake of the Woods . He did not show its source ? he inserted a detail map in the upper lefthand corner where it would have come ? but made a note saying , " It is supposed to arise about the 50th degree of Latitude . " So they decided it : " Thence through the said lake to the most northwestern point thereof , and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi . " Since the source of the Mississippi is well to the south of Lake of the Woods , the northwest corner of the United States was to be at an intersection that did not exist . The French minister at Philadelphia had clear sight . He wrote to his chief , Vergennes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the Lake of the Woods , are preparing for their remote posterity a communication with the Pacific . " The treaty made the West as far as Louisiana American , and the states with claims to the intervening lands had already re-  | linquished them to Congress , to the Congress which governed the United States under the Articles of Confederation . The possession of this area was the most powerful centripetal force the nation had . It proved to be just strong enough to hold the United States together under the Confederation , while every year increasing thousands of Americans crossed the mountains to develop the empire , which in turn strongly conditioned the nation that made the Constitution . Of several final determinants established under the Confederation one was a momentous provision first embodied in the resolutions of 1784 " for a temporary government of the western territory " and fully expressed in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 . The latter stipulated that from three to five states were to be created from the lands north of the Ohio and that these states should be admitted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states in all respects whatever . " The American empire would not be mercantilist but in still another respect something new under the sun ; the West was to be not colonies but states . The peace settlement gave the Floridas to Spain , which thus flanked the United States at the south . But it fulfilled the most ominous threat to Spain by bringing to the east bank of the Mississippi , separated from Louisiana by only that traversable water , a nation that was both a democratic republic and an expansionist empire . Necessarily Spain had to assert the thesis that Americans had no right to navigate the river . The settlement also appeared to cut off at least half of the Canadian fur trade . The routes west remained secure and the route from the West to the Northwest had been guaranteed . But Detroit , St. Joseph , the Sault , Mackinac , La Pointe , La Baye , Prairie du Chien , and Grand Portage were American . The economic shock was severe and was increased by the promptness with which American competition appeared in areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or none at all . The Montreal traders , who had the bulk of Canadian capital and were the energy of Canadian expansion , seemed likely to be bankrupted forthwith . There was also a sincere concern about the Western Indians . The period of transition to American control would at best inflict scarcity and therefore anarchy on them , and of course they must  | slowly die , for whereas Canada was Indian furs the United States was Indian land . Montreal , then , which had been unable to influence a ministry that was determined to make peace , succeeded in asserting its influence as soon as the peace was made . It made powerful representations : there would be a general Indian war , the British Empire would have a bankrupt Canada on its hands , it would lose half its imperial wealth or more than half . The reasoning sufficed . The treaty had bound Great Britain to evacuate the still garrisoned military posts it held on American soil , various unimportant ones but mainly the strategic centers at Oswego , Niagara , Detroit , the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the payment in sterling of private debts owed to British merchants and to do what it could to make the states restore to the loyalists the estates that had been confiscated from them . The United States had done nothing to carry out either provision and clearly was going to do nothing . The breach of faith made a sufficient rationalization for another one : Montreal got its way and the garrisons remained where they were . As long as they did so the trading posts and the fur trade seemed safe . Peace treaty to peace treaty , 1763 to 1783 . Through the two decades of turmoil the accumulation of knowledge had powerfully accelerated . The Age of Reason rocked societies as much as the wars did and the dynamics of expanding knowledge were preparing additional upheavals . . . . As minister plenipotentiary to France , Benjamin Franklin was commissioner of American privateers in European waters . One of his first officials acts , March 10 1779 , was to issue a " passport " for a man who he could not know had been murdered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Americans on the high seas to consider Captain James Cook and his two ships ' companies " common friends to all mankind , " to afford them all possible assistance , and to speed their return to England without hindrance or delay.5 Cook 's Resolution is one of history 's great ships and she was  | following the wake , two hundred years old , of a greater one , the Golden Hind . At daybreak on March 7 1778 she made a landfall on the coast of Oregon somewhat to the north of Coos Bay , stood out a little , and began to coast northward along the shore that Cook recognized as Francis Drake 's New Albion . One hundred and ninety-nine years before , June 17 1579 , standing to the south from about the same vicinity , Drake had anchored the Golden Hind in a California bay. ? Among the secret purposes of Drake 's voyage , though he made no effort to carry it out , was to discover the great Southern Continent . This was one of Western man 's oldest myths , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent that extended to the pole from southern Africa and stretched a hypotenuse to join with Asia and make the Indian Ocean a lake . As Terra Australis Incognita it was among the richest of the horizon lands and though the centuries shrank it inward a little , it lay gigantic and fair as a bride to be possessed just behind the curtain of mist to the southward , in the unimaginable distances of the Pacific . The great mariner who now followed Drake to the Northwest coast was on his third voyage of discovery in the Pacific . His second voyage there had ended in 1775 and in the course of it he had laid the myth forever : there was no Southern Continent , no Terra Australis. ? Another purpose of Drake 's voyage had been to find the Pacific gateway of the Northwest Passage . About this too he had done little but , circumnavigating the globe , he had kept secret the route of his homeward passage . It had been widely believed ever since , especially by officials of Spain and New Spain , that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed the Northwest Passage , probably the shape of it that was called the Strait of Anian . To settle once and for all whether that strait or any other Northwest Passage existed was the primary purpose of Cook 's third voyage . Belief that one led across Canada ? or taking off to the south of Canada in the hazy and extensible New Albion ? would not down . Maps of North America not dry from the press when he sailed showed such a continental passage in various latitudes , by various courses , among various archipelagoes , though most often as the Strait of Anian and in the high north. ? Maps showing its eastern portal at Hudson Bay were drawn in all countries in  | spite of the fact that there were people with open and certain knowledge that they were wrong . The Royal Society and the Hudson 's Bay Company ? at least some members of each ? knew that they were wrong . If surveys before that of Middleton in 1741 had not proved that no passage led to the Pacific from the western shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds except those drugged with fantasy . In 1746 the expedition to the Bay of William Moor and Francis Smith had proved it again , and Samuel Hearne 's magnificent descent of the Coppermine River to the Arctic Ocean in 1771 had clinched it once more . The believing mind can not be dissuaded , however , and from various conjectured entrances imaginary straits still continued to reach Hudson Bay . Moreover , one logical possibility remained and it had lately been made attractive by a theory that the Arctic Ocean was an open , ice-free sea . It might be that the strait which Bering had almost discovered and which had been named for him led to the Arctic . ( It does . ) Or it might be that some other passage led from the Pacific to the Arctic in the unknown area west of the Coppermine . If there were such an entrance to the ice-free northern ocean , then it would be possible to sail near the Pole to Baffin Bay , to Davis Strait and on to the Atlantic . England could at last end Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China . Or rather to India , for India counted more than China since the Seven Years ' War had made it almost wholly British . The clearest minds foresaw that the British Empire was going to be oriented on the Pacific . Was the Arctic in fact open in winter ? Was the land west of the Coppermine River continental and how far did it extend ? Was it an archipelago ? Was there , indeed , any land there ? Was there anywhere in the high latitudes any kind of passage from the Pacific to Hudson Bay or Baffin Bay ? Was there one to the Arctic ? Such questions could now be so asked as to be capable of being answered , whereas previously there had not been enough knowledge to give the phrasing reality . Cook was directed by the Admiralty and the Royal Society to answer them , and the terms of the standing offer of twenty thousand pounds to anyone who would find the Northwest Passage were changed to permit a naval officer to receive the award . Cook  | sailed on his third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what had happened in Philadelphia eight days before . As the Resolution worked northward from her Oregon landfall Cook noted that there was no opening where Martin Aguilar , of the Vizcaino expedition of 1602 , was believed to have seen one . " In the very latitude where we now were geographers have been pleased to place a large entrance or strait , the discovery of which they take upon them to ascribe to the same navigator , whereas nothing more is mentioned in the account of his voyage than his having seen in this situation a large river , which he would have entered but was prevented by the currents . " ( And Aguilar had seen his river only with the eyes of faith . ) Fog and weather that kept him well out from shore prevented him from seeing the river mouth which , unknown to him , another Spaniard , Bruno Heceta , had seen at 46 ? 17 ' . The same weather made him miss the important entrance to what would eventually be called Puget Sound . On March 29 he found an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound . Juan Perez , for the viceroy of New Spain , had preceded him there five years before , probably anchoring in the same strait but not landing , and had called it San Lorenzo . It was to come down as Nootka Sound . At first Cook supposed that the shore less than a hawser 's length away was the mainland but later learned that Nootka Sound and a series of similar narrow inlets made an island of it . He never suspected that the far shore was that of a greater island , which was eventually to be named for one of his young gentlemen , George Vancouver . Cook had been a warrant officer in the fleet that supported Wolfe in the campaign against Quebec , and so he thus became the first Englishman since Drake who had seen both coasts of North America . And with him on the Resolution was a corporal of marines , part genius and part moongazer , John Ledyard , a native of Groton , Connecticut , twenty-six years old . " It was the first time I had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time I at first left it , " he wrote , " and though more than two thousand miles this , though Cook 's determinations of longitude were exact distant from the nearest part of New England , I felt myself plainly  | affected . All the affectionate passions incident to natural attachments and early prejudices played round my heart , and I indulged them because they were prejudices . I was harmonized by it . It soothed a homesick heart and rendered me very tolerably happy . " This was the continental consciousness speaking . Thirty-three hundred miles from Connecticut , Ledyard had touched home . As soon as Cook anchored , big canoes put out from shore and the English met a new kind of Indians . They were the tribe who gave their name to the island , the Nootkas , of the culture that extended from Oregon to Alaska west of the coastal mountains . Seafaring Indians . The big canoes were made from the big cedars of the forest that came down to the water 's edge , and their navigators had such consummate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Cook , he said that his voyageurs , of the breed that had mastered the Western waters , were tyros in comparison . They lived in houses made of split planks and were master craftsmen in wood , the only Indians north of the Aztecs who ever were . They were also fine artists ; many artifacts in museums today are instantly recognizable from Cook 's descriptions . They lived in a country of gentle climate , rich with easily procurable food . Fishermen , sealers , even whalers , they had an economy that centered on the regional fish , especially the salmon , just as that of the Plains tribes centered on the buffalo . They were affluent and Cook said they were lazy ? he thought all primitives were . They had an intricate ceremonial system and a hierarchy of social castes from slaves to plutocracy . Cook noted that though phlegmatic they had violent tempers . He may be granted authority about tempers , being himself a perfected specimen of the type which the naval victories of the eighteenth century had created , God 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . ) He noted too that they were unawed and unfrightened . Right : they were a tough race and it was just as well , for from now on they were going to have to deal with sea dogs and with the equally basaltic American equivalent.9 They swarmed around the ship , haranguing the white man , singing their chants of welcome and exorcism , and disinfecting him with the sacred pollen . Some of them wore grotesque masks , ceremonial , totemic , or plutocratic , of carved and painted wood . Some had garments made from the skins of sea  | otters and these were momentous . Cook had an idea of their value ? the Admiralty and the Royal Society had had them in mind ? but it fell far short of the reality . " The fur of these animals , as mentioned in the Russian accounts , is certainly softer and finer than that of any others we know of ; and therefore the discovery of this part of the continent of North America , where so valuable an article of commerce may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference . " He was very right . Since the Indians wanted metal , preferring brass , the crew bought sea otter skins at bargain rates . " Whole suits of clothes were stripped of every button ; bureaus of their furniture , and copper kettles , tin canisters , candlesticks , and the like went to wreck . " Linen hung up to dry could be left unguarded but everything metallic disappeared ? twenty-pound hooks cut off the tackles , all the fittings of small boats . And the local chamber of commerce kept visitors away from the English , in order to turn a profit on the metal . Within a few days Cook perceived that the native trading system he had touched here was intricately ramified and extended far into the interior ? eastward . " The most probable way . . . by which we can suppose that they get their iron is by trading for it with other Indian tribes who either have immediate connection with European settlements . . . or receive it , perhaps , through several intermediate nations . The same might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ledyard , making the same observation , decided that they must come from a great distance and were " not unlikely from the Hudson 's Bay Company . " Cook guessed as much too but allowed for the possibility that the stuff might come up from Mexico and added " Canada . " The last was right : the Pedlars , out of Montreal . But wherever the iron originated , a circle had been closed . On the Pacific coast an Englishman and an American saw trade goods that had crossed the continent . His ships watered and new masts set , Cook got about his business . He made for 60 ? N. , where Vitus Bering had fixed a point on the American mainland . It was the peak called Mount St. Elias , at the place where the modern boundary of the Province of Yukon turns eastward in order to keep the coast Alaskan . From here on Bering had established practically nothing about the American shore , and the maps by his polyglot chroniclers and commentators were so full of guesses that Cook repeatedly  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of North America ; at any point one might perhaps sail northeast to the Arctic Ocean . All of Alaska , that is , might be islands and most of it might be open water . So from here on Cook carefully explored the coast . Once he thought he had found something and sailed two hundred miles up a big estuary that might be " a strait communicating with the northern seas . " But no ; it narrowed , " the marks of a river displayed themselves , " and the water was " very considerably fresher than any we had hitherto tasted . " Thick and muddy water , " with large trees and all manner of dirt and rubbish . " He sent out two boats to make sure . " We were now convinced that the continent of North America extended farther to the west than from the most reputable charts we had reason to expect . " This was a fact of basic importance and he was glad he had explored the estuary , for otherwise " it would have been assumed by speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea to the north or with Baffin 's or Hudson 's Bay to the east , and been marked perhaps on future maps of the world with greater precision , and more certain signs of reality , than the invisible , because imaginary , Straits of de Fuca and de Fonte . " By thus ending one hope , however , he created another . The estuary was Cook 's Inlet , which the 60th parallel crosses at 152 ? W. At its eastern end a complex of unimportant rivers flow into it . Cook assumed that their sum meant there was " a great river " there , and when his maps were published this suggested to the Northwesters at Lake Athabaska that they could reach it from their far country and go down it to the Pacific . He went on , turned the Alaskan peninsula and the long scythe blade of the Aleutians , and entered Bering Strait , having established that there was no other route to the Arctic . Hard and sudden storms struck , vast mountain ranges rose from the shore , glaciers crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin smoke , the natives showed a strong tincture of Eskimo culture and then were true Eskimos ? he was in the terrifying , desolately beautiful Far North . On August 9 he passed the narrows of the Strait , and later Ledyard expressed the awe of seeing a different continent on either side . Bright ice was everywhere . On August 18 it was " compact as a wall " and rose ten or twelve feet out of the water . He was half a  | degree north of the Arctic Circle , he could go no farther , winter was closing in . He turned south , calling the nearest point of land Icy Cape . He had proved to the hilt that Alaska was mainland . Reaching the Aleutians again , on Unalaska he twice got messages carried by amiable natives and written in a language no one could read . It was certainly Russian and he sent Ledyard to find the authors . The born cosmopolite found them , fainted in their steam bath , was revolted by the stench of their stewed seahorse and bear meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tribute ) , and had a fine time . He helped them drink the liquor Cook had sent with him , for of many novelties the most amazing was that they were Russians and yet had no alcohol . He took three of them back to the ships and the leader followed with most of his outfit . They were fur traders of course , commanded by one " Erasim Gregorioff Ismylof , " whose Arabian Nights autobiography Cook could hardly bring himself to believe . He found them a genial , boisterous , naive folk and got only hints of the incredible life they led and the incredible massacres of Aleuts they had perpetrated . Considering that no one could speak anyone else 's language , he got an astonishing amount of geographical information from them , copying their charts and correcting his . What was almost as important , he learned where their knowledge ended . He had proved that neither the Strait of Anian nor any other form of Northwest Passage existed . But the ice had prevented him from determining whether it was possible to sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his instructions had foreseen , he would have to try again next year.10 He was supposed to winter at Kamchatka but did not care to spend the long months doing nothing , so he sailed from Unalaska for the Sandwich Islands , intending to explore them . He had discovered and named them earlier this same year , 1778 . ( The Spanish had once glimpsed the archipelago from afar , more than two centuries before , and had long forgotten it . ) Cook had landed on several islands but not the Island of Hawaii itself . He did so now and was received as a god . But it was as an Englishman teaching natives their place that he got himself killed there in February 1779 . Cook was , James A. Williamson says , " the greatest explorer of his age , the greatest maritime explorer of his country in any  | age . " He forever destroyed two shining myths , erasing the Southern Continent and the Northwest Passage from the map of human ignorance . He added great stores of knowledge to the intellectual estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculations that made him the first man who had ever known for certain how wide North America is . Cook 's appearance on the Northwest coast was the first fuIfillment of a threat against which the Spanish had begun to take action nine years before . The threat was Russian as soon as Bering directed the attention of his employers , who had expanded across Siberia with amazing speed , to the Aleutian furs . At almost the same time it became a British threat , with a naval expedition appearing in the Spanish ocean in 1742 and capturing the Manila galleon . When the Seven Years ' War focused the imperial energy of the greatest sea power on the Pacific , the threat became acute . So at last Spain and New Spain turned to California . For generations Spain had lacked both money and energy for frontier expansion , and the west coast was fenced off by the peninsula of Lower California and the deserts of Arizona . The pioneering spirit seemed dead , though a renewal of zeal among the Jesuits just before their expulsion had established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was enough to hold the New Mexico settlements and to develop the silver mines . In fact it was to protect the mines that action was taken at last . They were the greatest concern , the constant anxiety ; they seemed always to be threatened from somewhere , from New Orleans , from St. Louis , from Canada , and now from Alaska or the Strait of Anian . That was the impetus . And Charles III of Spain found in Jose de Galvez , whom he sent to reorganize the finances of New Spain , a man of vigor and vision much like his own . Galvez , who had some of the imagination of Cones as well as the cynicism of the wearier age , conceived and launched the last Spanish expansion in North America . For a few splendid years the sixteenth century seemed to live again . Since the Vizcaino expedition of 1602 the Spanish had had a  | reliable chart of the California coast as far north as Cape Mendocino . Almost no one had touched the coast in all the years since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight and sometimes desperately needed a harbor there . All other knowledge of California belonged to a time even earlier than Vizcaino and , such as it was , had been lost under encrustations of legend , myth , and conjectural geography . But it was known that the Northwest Passage took off from somewhere on this coast . In fact , a wide choice of Northwest Passages . The Strait of Anian was already a century old when a rumor that Portuguese mariners were using it provided the chief stimulus for Vizcaino 's voyage . Its entrance was then supposed to be at about 48 ? N. ( Just below the actual entrance to Puget Sound . ) The latitude of 60 ? N. ( that of Mount St. Elias ) which appears so often in speculations about it was the one commonly attributed to a certain Maldonado , who in 1609 reported that he had sailed through it in 1588 . The imaginary Admiral de Fonte was supposed to have entered it ? or a river , or something ? at 53 ? ( halfway up the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinthine passage to high above the Arctic Circle . Drake was believed to have taken the Golden Hind and the Spanish gold through either it or still another passage , " the Englishman 's strait , " and no one could say where , except that it must be above 43 ? or above 48 ? . ( The southern boundary of Oregon is 42 ? . ) Juan de Fuca 's supposed entrance was between 47 ? and 48 ? . Any of these entrances could be moved to any latitude the dream required . The Pacific end of the fantasy whose Atlantic portal had been any inlet north of Florida , they constituted the " Northern Mystery " which must be dissipated if New Spain were to erect California into an outpost-stronghold to defend the silver mines . For the entrance of the Northwest Passage , or rather the exit , was one site that must be held at any cost , however great . Galvez worked out a plan and in 1769 ordered it carried out . He was using the threefold instrument with which Spain had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the colonist . Because the Jesuits had been expelled from New Spain his religious were the Franciscans . His good for-  | tune was to find at the head of them in Lower California , where the effort must be based , the American saint who has not yet been canonized , Junfpero Serra . And in Gaspar de Portola he found a first-rate captain . The first objectives were the known harbors of San Diego and Monterey . The expedition moved on the former in four divisions , two by land and two by sea . Despite the mountains and desert the colonization should have been no more than difficult , but all the breaks were bad . The land parties were in good health but almost starved . Those on the ships ate well but were decimated by scurvy ? accepted as inevitable by everyone except Cook , who found out how to prevent it ? and a mysterious additional epidemic.l ' Late in 1769 , which made it a hundred and sixty-six years after Vizcafno , the first California mission was founded ; it was San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navy recognized the bay at Monterey , though the ancient description of it was exact . The search for it was what brought the first white men to the Golden Gate , a scouting patrol under a sergeant named Francisco de Ortega . Eventually Monterey was located and there on June 3 1770 the second mission , San Carlos de Borromeo , was founded and with it the first presidio . California had begun . Two necessities remained : to connect it with Sonora by a trail and to push exploration up the coast . Portola 's naval commander was Juan Perez . In 1773 he was ordered to sail to 60 ? N. , the Strait of Anian . Scurvy and the storms common in these parts kept him from quite making it . He coasted Queen Charlotte Islands , without recognizing them as islands , and then was forced to turn back . On August 7 1773 he anchored in Nootka Sound , San Lorenzo to him , and gave Spain the claim to it that antedated Cook by five years . The regional fogs kept him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from checking the imaginary ones . Two years later Perez was back as chief pilot of an expedition dispatched with renewed urgency and headed by Bruno Heceta , the corvette Santiago and the schooner Sonora . They proved that there was no inlet at the latitude which Juan de Fuca had given as that of his passage inland . Somewhere on the Washington coast north of Gray 's Harbor they anchored and , as Bancroft says , " on July 14 Europeans set foot for the  | first time on the soil of the Northwest coast . " They made other landings and found the Indians viciously hostile . The stormy season was coming on , the inevitable scurvy had broken out . The captains decided to make as much northing as they could before weather and sickness drove them back to California . The schooner , captained by Bodega y Cuadra , who was to have a further career in these waters , made a very high one . He reached 58 ? , landed , and claimed Alaska for Spain . In the Santiago Heceta and Perez reached about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship leaky , the crew very sick . They ran along the shore when they could but again fog hid the entrances . But on August 17 ? this is 1775 , two months to the day after Howe 's regulars won the battle of Bunker Hill ? Heceta " discovered a large bay , to which I gave the name of Assumption Bay . " He could not land ; " if we let go the anchor , we should not have men enough to get it up . " He lay to , currents swept the ship out to sea during the night , and in the morning he was so " far to leeward " that he could not enter his bay . But he had fixed and described the two bold headlands that define it . He named the northern one Cape San Roque and his 46 ? 17 ' is exact to the mile ; the other one he called Cape Frondoso . They are Disappointment and Adams now . Having arrived opposite this bay at six in the evening and placed the ship midway between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four brazas twenty-three fathoms ; the currents and eddies were so strong that , notwithstanding a press of sail , it was difficult to get out clear of the northern cape , towards which the current ran , though its direction was eastward , in consequence of the tide being at flood . These currents and eddies of water cause me to believe that the place is the mouth of some great river , or of some passage to another sea . . .12 At last someone was right about a great river on this coast . This was the river that flows more water than any other in the United States except the Mississippi . There never was the Great River of the West but Heceta had found the reality that corresponded to the fantasies men had made up about it . To the pure fiction of Le Page du Pratz and many others , to the logic and desire of Verendrye and Carver and many others , to the felt necessity of Champlain at Georgian Bay thinking west-  | ward toward the Sea of China , to nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist of thought and dream . For seventeen years after Heceta no one would recognize it again or enter it or give it a name . Then it would be the Columbia . Meanwhile the route from Sonora to California had been worked out by a series of superb explorations . The hinge must obviously be the long-known junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers . In 1771 another great Franciscan , the saintly , desertloving Francisco Garces , set out from there , went down the Colorado almost to the mouth , and crossed the chaos of Lower California and its most northern mountains . He won the friendship of the Yuma Indians , a powerful tribe at the river junction . The next year , 1772 , the governor of Upper California , pursuing deserters eastward across the San Joaquin Valley , which was thus entered for the first time , pushed on to Cajon Pass and the Mohave Desert . In 1773 the same rumors of British and Russian activity that sent Perez toward the 60th parallel instigated an effort to break the overland trail from the Gila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the greatest of all Spanish frontiersmen , and he had Garces with him . In 1774 with magnificent skill and endurance they took a large party to the Gila and across the deserts , and forced the crossings of the Cocopas and the Sierra . Anza came out at San Gabriel , the mission that had been founded in 1771 just north of Los An ; el es . The next year he took a larger company of colonists to Monterey and on to San Francisco Bay and settled them there . The Arizona-California trail was marked and there was a watchtower on the Golden Gate . The final chapter must be called poetry . In 1761 the New Mexicans had at last entered the Rocky Mountains , more than two centuries after Coronado and with the same motive , to find gold and silver and precious stones . The pioneer was named Juan de Rivera and he made at least three journeys . They were all northward from Taos to Colorado west of the Continental Divide , and his farthest penetration was the junction of the Uncompahgre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punitive expeditions against the Indians entered the same region . Some knowledge of the country and of the various Ute bands that lived in it was amassed . In Coronado 's land of Cibola , at the pueblo of Zuni , the Franciscan missionary at Our Lady of Guadelupe was named Silvestre Velez de Escalante . He was zealous , energetic , restless , insatiably curious . He collected all the stories and rumors he could , a great bulk of them , about the deserts and the tribes who lived in them . Off to the westward , across the chromatic wasteland of bare rock , were the Hopis , who were mysterious , sullen , suspicious , and hostile . They must be converted or , as he at last came to believe , conquered . North of them and west of the area in Colorado that the New Mexicans had visited was an expanse about which it was hardly possible even to make guesses . The usual stories of horizon-land floated out of it ; among them the bearded Indians make their last appearance on the Spanish stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be descendants of Spaniards who had been wrecked on the California coast and worked their way inland . Deep in the rock desert there really were some Indians who wore mustaches and a kind of beard and eventually he found them . The Gila-Monterey trail was long , difficult , and exposed to raiding Apaches . Perhaps a shorter or a better route to Monterey could be developed from New Mexico . The idea was logical and naive ; it succinctly expresses the ignorance of the interior West that the Spanish had maintained since 1541 . In 1775 ( Daniel Boone was founding his station on the Kentucky River ) the authorities determined to find out about this postulated route through the unknown void . Instructions went to Garces , who was with Anza , and to Escalante , who forthwith made a spirited journey to the Hopis . They remained recalcitrant and heathen ? apostate rather , for long ago they were supposed to have professed Christianity ? and would have nothing to do with him . He picked up further rumors about the deserts but got some information too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from him Escalante heard about the big river on which his people lived . Escalante correctly identified it as the Colorado and conceived that it might have some bearing on the new route to Monterey . At any rate , that route must avoid the Hopis until they were disciplined .  | It must detour them ? to the north . Perhaps it could circle round to the Havasupais and certainly it must strike into the unknown land . So Escalante was convinced ; he was also convinced that God intended him to make the great entrada . The poem , dramatized against the backdrop of the rock deserts , is of the summer of 1776 . Liberty fires marked the routes of couriers from Philadelphia bringing word that the colonies were and of right ought to be free and independent states , and General Howe followed the defeated Washington out of New York so sluggishly as to suggest that he agreed with the Declaration . The first fantasy in colored stone was by Games , who set out to find the Hopis from the West and try his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him from tribe to tribe across the chromatic spectacle , he went from the mouth of the Gila to the Mohaves near Needles and from there across northern Arizona to the Grand Canyon country . So he found the Havasupais . That he could reach Cataract Canyon where they lived and descend its vertical wall is against reason but he did so . He spent five days with this remote tribe , who even today are no part of the known world . A gentle people , they responded to his gentleness and invited him to stay with them and forsake his foolish , heretical ideas . When he would not , they guided him to the south rim of the Grand Canyon ; no other white man had seen it since Cardenas two hundred and thirty-six years before . Gradually deserted by all his Indians except a child and an old man , he went on to the Little Colorado region and eastward across what is now the Hopi Reservation till he found the apostates he was looking for , at Oraibi . They would not listen to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went away . ( This was Independence Day . ) His poem ends with a three weeks ' canto of thirst and weariness that took him back to the Mohaves . It is a great work of art , this traverse of the unbelievable country , but a greater one began immediately.13 It will always bear Escalante 's name , though he was outranked by the civilian leader , a veteran frontier captain with a distinguished record named Miera y Pacheco , who was a good man with an astrolabe and a good cartographer , and at least technically by his superior in the New Mexican missions , Father Francisco Atanasio Dominguez , who was as active as he  | on the journey and did most of the preaching to Indians . Escalante would earn that reward of authorship anyway , for he kept the journal , but there can be no question that he was the principal person of the expedition and its principal sustaining force . The reasons for the expedition were mixed and curiously vague . The route to Monterey was the principal one , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor how , from that northing , they expected to reach the Havasupais and their river . The journal occasionally seems to have in mind another great river too but it was not one they ever found ; perhaps there was some idea they might reach the inland shore of the Strait of Anian , which of course would make the northern route to Monterey simpler and more valuable . There was the constant desire to take the Cross to the Indians who were known to be in the region they would cross and to others who would probably be found there . Among these last may have been a tribe which the rumors said lived by a lake , for when Escalante first meets the ones he calls the Lagunas he seems to have heard of them before . Besides Escalante , Dominguez , and Miera , there were seven others , several of whom had been to the western Colorado country before and one of whom could speak Ute . They were well supplied with horses and mules for mounts and with presents for the Indians and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 1776 and got back there January 2 1777 . They traveled more than fifteen hundred miles ; most of the route lay through country as difficult as any in the United States and some of it may fairly be called the most difficult . From Abiquiu , the New Mexican outpost west of Taos , they crossed northwestward into Colorado . Sometimes in the Southern Rocky Mountain Province of geographers , sometimes in the Canyon Lands , they worked north across a landscape that is shattered like the landscape of the moon . Much of it is high plateaus rimmed by higher peaks , much is naked rock gashed by canyons or the smaller arroyos that are heartbreakingly beautiful with their explosive opulence of trees and flowers . They reached the Uncompahgre River and the Gunnison , which is where the known country ended . For a considerable time they met no Indians but finally bands of lethargic Utes  | showed up and pointed the way for them when they did not know it themselves . And the way was begemmed with the names of holy saints , scores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of shade from stunted junipers where they nooned . The journal is all arroyos , gulches , canyons , mesas , mountainsides , ridges , labyrinths , mazes , rock slides . It is all untroubled too , certainly the most serene document in the annals of American exploration . He gave his angels charge over them lest they dash their feet against a stone , Now they heard that some of the Laguna Indians were visiting a near-by band of Utes . They heard something about the lake these Indians lived beside too , and the story was that they had pueblos there . They sought them out ? the Utes they were visiting were on the Gunnison in the vicinity of the Grand Mesa ? and , determining to visit their country , hired one for a guide . The journal gives small reason for the decision ; everything is tranquil , sunny , and of God 's favor but has little speculation about how to get to Monterey . They crossed White River to the Yampa Plateau and reached the southern edge of what is now Dinosaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian style : pyramidal , terraced , painted with brushes of comet 's hair . The Uinta Mountains , the one great range of the Rockies that has an east-west axis , stretched a barrier across the north ; the trail to Monterey would have had to turn west here even if the Indians at the lake had been left out of account . Less than a hundred and fifty miles farther north is the abrupt end of an even mightier range , the Wind Rivers ; at its base is South Pass , the portal through which the American odyssey would reach the interior west toward which Escalante now turned . A river comes down to the northern base of the Uintas , skirts them eastward for a space , and then cuts a way through them by a series of spectacular gorges , the last of which is called Split Mountain Canyon . This too is a great river and the fathers reached it where it hurtles through the scarred gateway of Split Mountain . They named it San Buenaventura . It would be called the Spanish River as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siskadee , and eventually Green River . It should be called the Colorado for it is the parent stream but governmental edict has bestowed that name on the Grand , which they  | had crossed on the way to the White . Escalante had no awareness that either was the river of the Havasupais which he was seeking . Beyond the Green they traveled the eroded Utah plateaus , easier going than most country they had crossed so far but with lung-straining slopes and terrifying gulches nevertheless . It got more fertile and more beautiful as they traveled west , reached the Wasatch Mountains , and on September 21 crossed the divide into the Great Basin . It was already autumn in the Wasatch , with nipping winds and a crystalline sky . At the shoulders of the peaks the fading silver of aspen would make the evergreens black and on the lower slopes oak brush would be scarlet fire ; the lavender of canyon shade would be purple hours before sunset . They had reached the valley of Utah Lake at the season of its greatest beauty ; small wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they travel with the smokes of signal fires alerting the timid bands who lived there , his journal describes the promising soil , the water and timber , the grazing , and what he says about it could be smoothly fitted into the first official American report on Utah Valley , which is Fremont 's . On September 23 , they reached both its lake and its Indians . It is not clear whether the Lagunas were a band of Utes whose culture had decayed or of the humbler Paiutes . Escalante rendered their native name in several spellings and ethnologists make it Timpaiavats , but the variant that has come down is Timpanogos . The Valley of Our Lady of Mercy of Timpanogos ? that is the name Escalante gave to the plateau which a more prosaic religion would cover with harsher names . The Indians were kindly , timorous , and feckless , and they did not live in pueblos as the Colorado Utes had said they did . They seemed eager for conversion , however ? in such a promising country any Indians not actually on the warpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back and establish a mission . ( In a burst of optimism Escalante said that this single valley was so rich it could support more pueblos than all New Mexico . ) They agreeably consented to supply guides for the trip to Monterey , though they had no notion where it was or how to get there . They explored the eastern shore of Utah Lake . The Lagunas  | told them about a river that flowed out of it northward to another , larger lake , whose waters were salty and harmful , in so much that anyone who washed with them would find his skin inflamed.14 They were strangely uninterested in this news . The other lake was nature 's loyal realization of Lahontan 's fantasy , Great Salt Lake , though there were none of his magnificent Tahuglauks rowing galleys down canals between houses thatched with gold . Escalante could have reached it in less than two days ' travel and that he did not make the journey is inexplicable . It is all the more so because , as Miera 's report makes certain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a very large and navigable river flowed west from it , and surely their first duty was to explore any such river as a possible route to Monterey . Miera thought it must be the Tizon , which he believed ( Mate had discovered and named ; but Tizon was Melchior Diaz 's name for the Colorado . When he drew his map he showed it flowing west from the larger lake ? and so created a cartographer 's myth , for later maps would show just such a river flowing out of Great Salt Lake to the Pacific and would give it the name that Escalante had given Green River , the San Buenaventura . They knew that Monterey was somewhere to the west , and knew little or nothing more . They made off southwestward , the direction forced on them by the mountains , and straightway were in the Utah deserts . For a time it was merely desert travel , requiring the minutely vigilant skill that they took to he God 's favor but not such a nightmare as the Canyon Lands had been . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanishing point , snowstorms blew out of the mountains , and the two priests had to acknowledge that , God having sent no guidance , they knew neither where Monterey was nor where they were . They were afraid of being caught for the winter in such deserts as they were now traveling or in the passes of ranges farther west , without food or Indians to get it for them . ( A brawl in camp had scared their guide into deserting . ) Their decision to head toward Santa Fe across the desert was the right one but it angered the laymen , who were for sticking to their orders and going on to Monterey , which was just over yonder a little way . Miera and his men , in fact , objected so violently that the priests determined to leave it to God . Bidding every-  | one put himself in a reverent state of mind , they said the rosary and some litanies and then cast lots . It came out Santa Fe . There has always been a suspicion that Escalante nudged divine wisdom by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey is out of the apochryphal books , incredible to those not greatly gifted with belief . They passed to the east of St. George and into the Arizona Strip along the Hurricane Cliffs , then northeastward through a gigantic lacework of stone , to the Paria Plateau and on to the Grand Canyon wilderness . " The descent to the river is very long , high , rough , and rocky , and has such bad ledges of rock that two pack animals which went down to the first one were unable to climb up in return , even without pack saddles . " Many days were like that ? many descents , many ascents , and no sure trail . They found their bearded Indians , who were frightened as all tribes hereabout seemed to be , and others as well ; but though all were fluent with advice none would guide them very far . Frequently in danger of death from thirst , sometimes with only sickening dried seeds or cakes of " sunburned " cactus to eat , they kept on going with serene assurance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel they went alone . There was only one place where the Colorado could be crossed , an immemorial ford used by Utes and Navahos . It was frequently described to them but they had no idea where it was . They missed it when they at last got down from the cliffs to the river and so had to go back for a time into the apochryphal geology . At last one more narrow canyon , where " it was necessary to cut steps in the rock with axes " so that the horses could make it , led out to a place where the Colorado looked slack enough . It was the ford . " About five o'clock in the afternoon the last members of the party finished crossing the river , praising God our Lord and firing off a few muskets as a sign of the great joy which we all felt at having overcome so great a difficulty . " No white man had crossed it before them . They named the ford for the Most Holy Conception of the Virgin Mary but ever since Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fathers . After that it was an anticlimax in fortitude that they had to cross similar country till they reached the sullen Hopis and could go on from there to Santa Fe in something like comfort .  | ... Nothing came of this sunnily stupendous journey . Thirtyodd years later , traders out of Santa Fe and Taos took to using some of their route in Colorado , and on the way to California crossed their trace in the Parowan country . Little is known about these shadowy figures , whose pathway came to be called the Old Spanish Trail . But no one followed Escalante into the Great Basin now , to baptize the Utes and Timpanogos whom he had promised salvation . The brilliant promise of the Spanish reawakening turned out to be a sunset color after all and it had already begun to fade . That power and energy and desire alike had failed , events at Nootka Sound would soon demonstrate . California itself became a dreamy anarchy . The Spanish made no effort to explore beyond Escalante 's pathfinding or to colonize the Valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the next century , William Ashley and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company , and Brigham Young and the Latter-Day Saints . After the islanders killed Cook , Captain James Clerke succeeded to the command . In the summer of 1779 he tried Bering Strait again but the ice stopped him and he concluded that the assigned task was hopeless . Presently he died and the American-born John Gore took the ships to England , ending the great voyage in October 1780 . But in December 1779 he touched at Canton , and the sea otter furs that had been so casually and cheaply acquired at Nootka and up the coast sold for a small fortune . At least two-thirds of them had been spoiled or given away ; the remnants , which were certainly disposed of at much less than their value , fetched two thousand pounds sterling in China goods . " The rage with which our seamen were possessed to return to Cook 's River and , by another cargo of furs to make their fortune at one time , was not far short of mutiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition 's journal . Forthwith in two and a half pages he sketched out , practically to the last detail , a trading plan that adventurers of England were to put into effect , a plan for the Northwest Trade . The first British trading ship went to Nootka in 1785 . The American marine John Ledyard also saw the oppor-  | tunity in full . In December 1782 , a year after Yorktown but a year short of the peace , his ship anchored off Huntington , Long Island , and he deserted the King 's service . He wrote his book and turned with terrible intensity to the ambition that dominated the rest of his life . It was twofold : to put the United States into the Northwest trade , whose triangularity he foresaw , and to cross North America eastward from the Pacific coast.15 Ledyard was the first American to understand the possibilities of the Northwest maritime trade and the first to propose it . The time was propitious . Shipping interests had been all but ruined . by the peace treaty . The fisheries barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British West Indies was closed and the development of a satisfactory smuggling system would require years . The United States was being forced to the high seas and especially to the Pacific . Ledyard , like King before him , conceived just such a system as the merchants presently worked out . But he was misfortune 's godchild : many times he seemed launched on his way but each time something beyond his power to affect stopped him short . Shipping interests in New London were impressed and stimulated but would not invest . At Philadelphia Ledyard convinced Robert Morris , who undertook to execute his whole plan and make him its director ? but then withdrew and instead backed the Empress of China , which in 1784 actually opened the China , but not the Northwest , trade for the United States . He could get no American backing and went to France , where Cook 's discoveries had produced furious activity . Merchants of Lorient prepared to send him to the Northwest coast but this enterprise too failed , being blocked ( probably ) by the official voyage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went on to Paris and there formed a partnership for the great endeavor with a man whose career was even more romantic than his own , John Paul Jones . His star would not rise : this too failed . Meanwhile Ledyard had met Franklin , who was retiring at last from the American ministership , and his successor Jefferson . Ledyard told Jefferson his plan for exploration . All other ways of getting to Nootka having failed , he now proposed to go to Russia , cross Siberia , and at Kamchatka or elsewhere find a ship engaged in the Aleutian trade . When he reached the  | North American coast , he would cross the continent to New York on foot . He would do this with no outfit and no white companions : he would be Moncacht-Ape in reverse . Apart from his effort to establish the Northwest trade , this intention is the principal reason for his celebrity.16 Jefferson warmed to the idea , though he understood how much of it was fantasy , and they saw much of each other . Suddenly there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time he actually got to sea on a ship bound to Nootka Sound but its papers were irregular ( it was infringing on the chartered monopoly ) and it was overhauled and forced to return . This was in 1786 , the British trade to the coast had begun , and Ledyard came under the highly important patronage of Sir Joseph Banks , Cook 's original backer , who was about to become head of the Royal Society . He could have got Ledyard a place with the Colnett expedition but gave it to another favorite instead . Eventually there was nothing left but the trans-Russian plan . In December 1786 he set out without a passport and with only a few pounds to travel on ? ever since leaving the United States he had lived by the penurious favor of rich men ? and when Jefferson heard from him from St. Petersburg he had " only two shirts and yet more shirts than shillings . " Ledyard 's frenzied , tragic , and the truth is half-mad , journey does not come within the purpose of this narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Irkutsk . He had had various companions and he was being watched . Now he came under the scrutiny of Russian fur traders who were developing the Aleutian field and at that moment were preparing to expand southward along the coast to California . They could not let him carry out his plan and they did n't . They let him make a slow descent of the Lena to Yakutsk but forced him to spend the winter there . In February 1788 he was arrested on orders from St. Petersburg ? technically for espionage , actually to keep him from reaching Okhotsk or Kamchatka  --  and was hur. ried all that long way back to Europe . Less than a year later , while on an expedition to Africa for Banks , he died in Cairo . p 300 Alexander Henry and the Frobishers had taken a momentous step , economically and geographically , when they moved from Saskatchewan waters to those of the Churchill basin , but they learned at once that an even more important one was indicated . In 1775 they had heard about distant Lake Athabaska , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1776 told them still more about it , and about Peace River and another river that ran northward to some sea . There was word about the Rocky Mountains too ( which would sometimes be called the Chipewyan Mountains because of these same Indians ) and the people who lived west of them . Some of those people were with the Chipewyans as captives , and their owners said that the Pacific could be seen from their country . But the main thing was the big lake farther north , whose name everyone would spell differently from now on , and its wealth in furs , which evidently was greater even than that which the Pedlars had found on the Saskatchewan and the Churchill . When Joseph Frobisher and Alexander Henry turned back to Grand Portage in 1776 , it was with the purpose of reaching Lake Athabaska that Thomas Frobisher stayed behind . He did not make it ; he had to return to Lake Isle-a-la-Crosse and spend the winter there . For not only the furs grew more numerous as you went north : so did the difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 ? , but it had taken them eight days to get there from their temporary post at Beaver Lake ? and Lake Athabaska was much farther north , so much that the route to it from Grand Portage was 1850 miles long.17 They had crossed into another geographical province , the subarctics . God had not sufficiently divided the land from the waters there . In a ten-mile square there may be a hundred lakes big enough to be mapped and a hundred smaller ones making the spaces between them impassable . Rivers widen into lakes for miles at a stretch but the channel through them is narrow and twists like the threads of a screw , with a gashed canoe if you miss a bend in it . Infrequent hills are naked granite , except for an occasional slope of dolomite which has a welcome covering of grass . But mostly the shores rise only a few inches above the water . Near the water they are sandy and so , like patches farther inland that have been burned , they are heavily timbered with  | jack pine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor water nor mud but a scrofulous compound of them all , patch after patch of it to infinity , each patch ringed with black spruce . The country is four-fifths drowned and when not frozen is halfhidden by mosquitoes and black flies . To get beyond the Saskatchewan had strained the system to the utmost ; to go into the high north would necessitate radical innovations . One necessity was to solve the problem of sustenance ; as it was , canoes could carry no more food for their crews , and winterers lived exclusively on fish , smelled like Winnebagos , and sometimes came close to starving . To get to Portage du Traite , the Frobishers had had to arrange a timed meeting with canoes bringing them pemmican from the Assiniboins . And pemmican proved to be the answer , worked out by the Frobishers and the crabbed genius Peter Pond , Indian pemmican , the greatest of all concentrated foods . It could be made from any meat and some of that which Pond bought in the North was made of deer and elk and even reindeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was dried by sun and wind or over a slow fire , pulverized , sometimes flavored with dried fruits and berries , mixed with melted buffalo fat , and then sealed with more fat in parfleche bags . So packed , it would last for years and took up a minimum of space . It was a complete diet in itself , it could be eaten raw or cooked , and it never palled on a man as the frozen fish always did . The woods buffalo ranged as high as Great Slave Lake , far beyond Lake Athabaska , but the North was not a sufficiently large source of supply as the trade grew larger and a complexly interdependent system of procurement and transport was worked out . So the Plains tribes became the principal suppliers , the trade with them became more important , and for the first time the South Saskatchewan , which flowed through the plains , became an important highway . Soon the North West Company was itself manufacturing pemmican in enormous quantities . Production centered at Pembina on the Red River and was mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English traders who became the Metis of Canadian history . Supply depots where it was stored were set up at the posts that held the important crossings of the canoe routes . Pemmican enabled the Pedlars to enter the farther country  | and Pond himself was the first . The stringencies of competition and overhead expense had already suggested such combinations as Henry and the Frobishers formed in 1775 . Now in 1778 four Saskatchewan traders pooled their surplus goods and sent Pond north . He went where Thomas Frobisher had been unable to go , to Lake Athabaska . Churchill River , to whose drainage system Lake Isle-a-la-Crosse belongs , flows into Hudson Bay . Pond 's route took him from that lake to the one that is now named for him ? " very shallow , " Mackenzie says , " and navigated with difficulty even by half-laden canoes " and on to Methy River and up that to Methy Lake . From here a thirteenmile portage led across the height of land ; it ended in " a very steep precipice whose ascent and descent appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eight hills , some of which are almost perpendicular . " It was climactic for it led to Arctic drainage : beyond it lay the Clearwater River , which flowed into the big Athabaska River , which emptied into Lake Athabaska . At 59 ? N. , in a different kind of world , Montreal reached its richest subtreasury ; it was so full of furs that Pond could take back only half of those he got . There was a new name now . The combination of 1779 , composed of eight partnerships , was temporary but it was called the North West Company . It fell apart ; the merchants were not yet convinced that it was stupid to take a quick profit from undercutting one another , nor their winterers convinced that price-slashing , piracy , peonage , subornation , mayhem , and occasional murder would not pay off . But the duress of the facts produced other temporary combinations which became another North West Company in 1784 , and three years later a reorganization gave it permanent shape . There would always be opposition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this was the dominant amalgamation . It was Canada 's trust , it was trying to become a monopoly in the country of the chartered monopoly , its methods were as ruthless as that country , and it was the answer to a tremendous question , the right instrument for expansion . Or almost the answer . For from the beginning its best minds , and Pond first , saw that another step was necessary for completion , one that would make it bigger and more powerful and enable it to go farther .  | Pond organized what was to be known as the Athabaska Department . All the North West Company had an aggressive esprit de corps ; management could hardly have got the underpaid lower ranks to spend their lives in labor , hardship , and danger at the extremity of endurance if they had not had pride of craft . But the greatest pride and the lordliest demeanor were those of the Athabaska men . All the other departments were based on Grand Portage . ( Later on Kaministiquia , when the company moved its headquarters out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route west and built Fort William there . ) But not the far northerners . A special depot for them was set up at Rainy Lake and a special caste of porkeaters carried their goods to it . No one disputed their preeminence or challenged their privileges and immunities . They came down to Rainy Lake with the furs as soon as the streams were open , and their renewal by saturnalia had to be brief for the race was to get back before the streams froze again . They left Rainy Lake in August ; they and the first film of ice reached Lake Athabaska in October . In January they sent out the Winter Express , the letter and report that began here and circulated , growing as it traveled , among the lower posts and on to headquarters . They were the northern anchor but they were also the northern spearhead and as the years passed they worked on to Slave River , Great Slave Lake , and beyond , and westward to Peace River . Pond 's stay in the North was broken at least twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country he himself saw . It does not matter , either , for what counts is his thinking . Genius has chosen few odder habitations than this half-illiterate , quill-bearing brawler . David Thompson was wrong to call him unprincipled but less than severe when he added " of a violent character . " If there had been law west of Grand Portage Pond could be said to have murdered a partner and shared in the murder of a competitor , and as it was , the latter violence forced him to withdraw from the country he had pioneered . But in full measure and beyond any of his associates he had the continental consciousness ? which must be seen as having two levels , of thought and of the feel for the land 's reality that underlies thought . At his post forty miles up Athabaska River from the lake , he directed the rich trade and the meshed activi-  | ties that supported it . He grew garden stuff , in the shortest of seasons , as an experiment in simplifying the problem of supply . But most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the still farther country . His mind was set westward and , if his spelling was eclectic , it was as powerful a mind as any that had ever grappled with the mysteries of the continent . He has to be followed , mostly , in his maps and in the thinking and reports of minds he fructified and the actions of men who took leading from him , but wherever one touches him there is an urgent and even desperate will to find out , to break through , to solve the last problem of Canada . Curiously this intelligence working in the interest of commerce is driven by the desire that is for its own sake only : to know the nature of things . The last problem was the Pacific Ocean . What routes led to it ? How did the Arctic Ocean fit in ? Pond learned of a lake farther north than Great Slave Lake , which , God knew , was far enough north of him . The farther one was the huge Great Bear Lake , which extends beyond 67 ? N. He learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually he learned that this was not the Coppermine which Hearne had descended . He learned a lot about the Rockies and a lot that was not true about what lay beyond them . He could not put it together right but he spent years trying to and his thinking has as solid importance as any in the record of the westward thrust . A stiff man whose blood was as cold as his was hot , and who disdained him , was to reap the reward of that thinking , which centered on the great river farther north than his fort at the ridgepole of the hemisphere , and on the possibility that it might lead to the Pacific . ' s Meanwhile competition with the big rival and the small ones multiplied activity in the regions to the south . Before 1790 a good many posts were built in the sector between Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan . In this country the Hudson 's Bay Company could use the advantage that cheap transportation gave it and the additional one provided by the nearness of York Factory , as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading season earlier . That was the sum of its advantages , however ; it fought hard but unskillfully and under heavy handicaps . Institutional rigidity , caste stratification , failure to provide incentives for its servants , unimaginative and  | even stupid management , slowness to learn from competition , a mild queasiness about violence , disregard for what the customer wanted ? all such products of chartered privilege worked against it . Even more basic was the fact that the Pedlars had the inherited French system and the French Canadians who were its foundation , whereas the Company 's Orkneymen did not like the country and seemed unable to master its skills . The Northwesters hired away its best men , they had the briskness and ingenuity that it lacked , they had no conscience , and when the Company met them head-on by building posts opposite theirs , they cut prices , intimidated the rival bourgeois , stole their Indians , and ranged deeper into the wilderness to intercept more customers and find new ones . The Company had no choice but to follow and imitate ; by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come tumbling down . There was a cluster of posts at the great crossroads of The Pas and another one at the higher crossroads where the Saskatchewan forked . From there both companies leapfrogged up the river . The northern branch became a highway to the upper country , which had hitherto been reached by way of The Pas , Sturgeon Lake , and Cumberland House . This highway led through Assiniboin country toward the Blackfeet , the suspicious and belligerent customers who would not hunt beaver but did make pemmican and who by now had won ascendancy over the Snakes . The southern branch , which was exploited more slowly , also led to the Blackfeet but by way of their congeners the Fall Indians . The Company 's melancholy William Tomison was the first to go very far up the South Saskatchewan but the Northwesters ' Peter Pangman leapfrogged him , a man much like Pond , intransigeant , a pioneering explorer , alternately a partner and a leader of tempestuous oppositions . Farther south was the Assiniboine River . The Northwesters used Verendrye 's route to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company reached it more directly , west across Lake Winnipeg below , by Lake Winnipegosis and Swan River higher up . Posts spread up the Assiniboine to the big bend , beyond it to the Elbow , in the quadrangle south of Red Deer River , on the Qu'Appelle River . ( Crying River : it had a spirit that mourned at night . ) Unbridled and unprincipled competition produced a buyer 's  | market , but the buyer was controlled by intimidation and debauchery . If the Company was somewhat the slower to use gunfire , it had as much rum as anyone else . ( The Northwesters averaged two hundred gallons per canoe , most of it " high wine , " that is rectified spirits , 180-proof . ) All traders stole one another 's customers as often as possible . Sometimes they took the Indians ' furs from them at the point of a musket , sometimes they beat up their own or strange Indians on suspicion of trading with someone else . The Indians liked the rise in the price of furs and the increasing frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliate them . So in a country where the white man had previously had no trouble with Indians there was a flurry of rebellion in 1780 . It was touched off when a trader solved the problem of a drunken chief by giving him a dose of laudanum that killed him . It cost the trader a pitched battle , his goods , and his fort . This was on the North Saskatchewan and it seemed to Indians so excellent an innovation that they attacked a couple of posts on the Assiniboine , killed some more white men , and gave some indication that they might make a general war . Pedlars and Company men found reasons for a more cordial amity than they had practiced , abandoned exposed posts , and supported one another . If any uprising was in the making , the winter of 1781 ? 82 put a stop to it . War parties from the upper Missouri country brought smallpox north with them to tribes that had never had it before , and it spread across the Northwest . The country came close to being depopulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mackenzie wrote , " but to submit in agony and despair . To aggravate the picture . . . may be added the putrid carcases which the wolves with a furious voracity dragged forth from the huts or which were mangled within them by the dogs . . . .

At least half the Mandans died . The survivors abandoned the ill-omened villages at the mouth of Heart River ? the center of the world ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There they built villages near those of the Minnetarees , who were also called Gros Ventres but were not related to the Gros Ventres who were called the Fall Indians . Their withdrawal left the Missouri open to the Sioux , who up to now had conducted themselves humbly or were easily frustrated when they were belligerent , but who were coming west and embracing the Plains culture in increasing numbers . The Mandans were never a vigorous people again and presently they began to be afraid of the Sioux . Within a few years trading posts for them , their Minnetaree neighbors , and their visitors from the West had been built on the Souris River . The first British advance to the Mandan villages , which was entirely illegal since they were on Spanish soil , appears to have been made in 1785 . ) The trade of the Northwest was at a standstill for a year after the smallpox . It had already been seriously inconvenienced by difficulties that had piled up from the Revolution , since the necessities of defense and the fear of capture by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods . The Hudson 's Bay Company suffered a disaster in 1782 , when in a last-act oddity of the war Admiral La Perouse took a French naval squadron into Hudson Bay , captured Fort Churchill , and burned York Factory to the ground . The Northwesters were struggling with the problem of costs ; the overhead , especially transportation charges , increased multiply and complexly as the distance increased . ( As a single item : in the vicinity of the Saskatchewan the Alaska white birch takes the place of other varieties . The trees are smaller and have more branches . Bark must be taken in smaller strips , which meant more labor , and it had more holes in it . Canoes therefore cost more and did not last so long. ) 20 These were the forces that had impelled the Pedlars to combine , had produced the North West Company and given it , in 1787 , its final form . But the same forces impelled them to other actions and plans . The cost of transportation showed that a connection with the Pacific , and deep-sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with news of Russian activity on the coast , of Cook 's discoveries , and of the  | rich trade that the sea otter made possible . As early as 1781 Pond 's associate and apt pupil , Alexander Henry , proposed to the influential scientist Joseph Banks , of the Royal Society , an expedition that would reach the Pacific by traveling northwest in the high latitudes.21 Henry 's details were necessarily vague but , using Pond 's geography , he was confident that a route from Lake Athabaska could be found . Four years later , in 1785 , the North West Company called on the government to give it a monopoly of the trade in the regions which it would discover , in return for an exploration to the Pacific . Henry 's letter to Banks had foreshadowed a further step : a demand for a merger of the North West Company and the Hudson 's Bay Company or , if the latter would not make terms , then a revision of its charter that would permit others to use the Bay and the rivers that flowed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This idea , revolutionary but as it ultimately proved inevitable , was already in Henry 's mind and Pond 's and would become Alexander Mackenzie 's fixed purpose . But , essential as the Hudson Bay connection was to the full implementation of trade imperialism , the Pacific was even more fundamental . It seemed such a short distance from the markets which the Northwesters now reached by that infinitude of portages from Montreal : to get there had become the paramount necessity . The geographical problem obsessed Pond at Lake Athabaska . As he went on talking to Indians from beyond , as he studied Cook 's text and maps and more imaginative maps by other hands , he changed his ideas . He had first supposed that the still unvisited river which he knew flowed out of Great Slave Lake must empty into the Arctic . He now concluded that , instead , it must flow to the Pacific . It must be , in fact , the big river which Cook had supposed accounted for the fresh water at the eastern end of Cook 's Inlet . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final barrier , must end somewhere south of it . He decided that the Pacific , as Henry put it , " ca n't be any Great Distance " away . . . . It never had been any great distance away since Champlain , since Verrazano . Pond 's post was in fact only a few degrees south of the latitude of Cook 's Inlet but , because he was unable to determine longitude , he thought it was a great deal farther west than it was . At any rate , he prepared to test his theory , to find Cook 's  | River and go down it to the Pacific . Or rather , since he was fifty , to send down it a man half his age who was his second in command and whom he had made letter-perfect in his ideas . He sketched a complete plan for this young man ? he was Alexander Mackenzie . Mackenzie was to go to Great Slave Lake and follow the river which flowed west out of it ? Cook 's River ? to the Pacific . From there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kamskatka , and thence to England through Russia . " 22 Mackenzie , that is , was to exactly reverse John Ledyard 's dream . But Pond could not stay at Athabaska while he did so . He was held responsible for a clerk 's murder of a rival trader and , in a sudden conversion to comparatively peaceful methods which resulted in the final redistribution of North West Company partnerships , feeling against him got so strong that he had to leave the high country . In 1789 Alexander Mackenzie was twenty-five years old . That he had been a North West Company partner for four years amply proves that he was a first-rate man as well as a wellconnected one . He had ample experience of the high country too , for he had spent two winters there , though that was a slight apprenticeship compared to Pond , the ancient of days . He had mastered business principles and the geography of trade . Now he was to work out a fully articulated conception of commercial imperialism . Well in advance of anyone else he determined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of the last imperial struggle that was implicit in continentalism . In courage , in the faculty of command , in ability to meet the unforeseen with resources of craft and skill , in the will that can not be overborne , he has had no superior in the history of American exploration . But he is a hard man to like . The Scots who were nine-tenths of the North West Company 's aristocracy average remarkably high in arrogance , caste brutality , and the paralysis of personal emotions that is called reserve . Mackenzie had them in a measure that raised him above the rest . All that softens him is the desire for knowledge ? knowledge for its own sake ? that got scant respect from the primordial capitalists who were his partners . Clearly he got the desire by infection from Pond , to whom he felt a contemptuous superiority that can still be perceived , a hundred and fifty years later , in the accents of his prose .  | In 1789 Mackenzie built a post on the shore of Lake Athabaska , to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single canoe with five voyageurs and the squaws of two and an Indian guide , accompanied by a second canoe filled with trade goods and a scattering of other Indians , he set out for the Pacific Ocean . In his mind he was going to go to Cook 's Inlet and on to Unalaska : he was beginning a continental crossing . It would have been the first one since Cabeza de Vaca . One hundred and two days later he was back . Out of Lake Athabaska , the Slave River led to Great Slave Lake , which is larger than Lake Erie . ( The name is from the Indians on the lower reach of the river , which was a war road to the Hares still farther north . ) Flowing northward out of Slave Lake was one of the biggest rivers on the continent , with a drainage basin of a million square miles . Mackenzie reached it on June 29 and it has his name now , but he took it to be what Pond had supposed it was , Cook 's River , flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course bore westward as it should , a most hopeful omen . But on July 2 " at nine we perceived a very high mountain ahead , which appeared on our nearer approach to be rather a cluster of mountains stretching as far as our view could reach to the southward , and whose tops were lost in the clouds . " They were the Rockies . Rivers came down from them and the big river he was descending never led into them . An enormous range would eventually bear his name , like the river , but the sum of them was what Pond 's thinking had been unable to conceive . . . . What all thinking about the western crossing had been unable to conceive . This was the barrier to navigation that traversed the whole extent of the continent from north to south . It was not a slight barrier , a half-day portage for bark canoes , it was something for which no earlier experience could prepare the mind . Mackenzie 's was the first attempt that put it to the empirical test . He drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows from an even larger lake , past the Hares , past the Quarrelers , into country where the bellicose Eskimos could be expected but never appeared . He traveled with a fury that was imposed on him by the shortness of summer and by the fear which his Indians and voyageurs felt increasingly in this most hideous of desolations . Even though he underestimated the distance he  | was traveling ? for it was a swift river and he pushed his men to the utmost ? he was disheartened by the long northing that never turned into the mountains at his left or revealed a passage through them . On July 12 , with the mountains still there , he reached salt water . It was the Arctic Ocean , though he was not sure he had gone all the way . But he got the point : the river he had traveled was not a route to the Pacific . But also his route had not intersected the Northwest Passage . He was certain that he had driven the last nail : surely no one could continue to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of his partners , and they continued to believe in it after his next expedition and on into the nineteenth century . He spent three days pushing his canoe among islands and ice floes , chasing whales , and trying to measure tides ? tides which he still was not sure were of the open sea . Then he summed up his defeat by naming his river Disappointment and turned back . On the way north he had heard fabulous stories about the far side of the mountains ; on the way back he got more solid stuff . The Indians said that beyond the ranges there was a river that ran into the white man 's lake ? so big a river that compared to it Disappointment " was but a small stream . " They must have been talking about the Yukon but when they sketched a map in the sand they rearranged geography and said that the white man had a fort at its mouth . The people there " make canoes larger than ours , " which agreed with Cook 's report , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost red , " which was unmistakably the sea otter . A conclusion was forced on him : " This I took to be Unalaska Fort and consequently the river to the west to be Cook 's River , and that the body of water or sea into which this river Disappointment : the Mackenzie discharges itself at Whale Island communicates with Norton Sound . " At the farthest north the West continued to generate marvels . The Indians said that the people who lived beyond the mountains were " of gigantic stature " and had wings , though they did not fly with them . They could kill you with the glance of an eye and they ate big birds which were also man-killers . And at the farthest north the way of nature held . His informants were the most miserable Indians he had ever seen , and  | yet though " to the eye of a European they certainly were objects of disgust . . . there were those among my party who observed some hidden charms in these females which rendered them objects of desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon dissipated their alarms and subdued their coyness . " He had found and now he phrased the irreducible core : " The sources of those streams which are tributary to both the great rivers are separated by the mountains . " It was the end of the pyramidal height of land . Even so , even though the land westward was upraised in those gigantic peaks , it was not very wide . " By the Indian Account the Pacific Sea is but a short way to the westward . " And there must be a seaway too ; he believed that only the ice would keep one from getting there from the mouth of the Mackenzie River . He would have himself forced a way over those mountains right now but he could not hire anyone to guide him . Mackenzie 's journey to the Arctic had final importance . Unhappily the truth it disclosed was the most frustrating kind , negative proof , and the mystery remained unsolved . And he had unlocked no new profits for the North West Company , to whose summer meeting of partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Directors believed no more readily then than now that knowledge as such is a capital asset . The imperial vision which Mackenzie was opening to them would have given them a corner on the furs of a hemisphere but he could make no down payment . " My expedition was hardly spoken of but that is what I expected . " Thus the partners , though it would be a heroic story at the posts from now on , and a few years later their continuing indifference would drive him from the company into the opposition . The reasons for his journey still held good and his indomitable spirit had been polarized . The mystery still had to be solved , the facts still had to be dug out , the way to the Pacific still had to be found . Now he would make it exact . " I was not only without the necessary books and instruments such as star-tables , an accurately calibrated sextant , a chronometer but also felt myself deficient in the sciences of astronomy and navigation . " He determined " to procure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | THE PARK RIVER , after meandering eastward across North Dakota , is about forty miles south of the Manitoba boundary when it empties into the Red River . Alexander Henry the younger built a trading post near its mouth when he commanded the Red River Department for the North West Company ? he was a nephew of the Henry who has appeared in this narrative and had bought his uncle 's shares . He then built a small feeder post farther up the Red at the site of Grand Forks , where the Red Lake River comes in from Minnesota , and another one downstream exactly on the Manitoba line , at a site where already there had been several evanescent posts . The latter was to become famous as Pembina but for a time Henry 's headquarters were at Park River . His customers were Crees from the north , and Assiniboins from west and north , but mostly Chippewas . The Chippewas were at their farthest west here and they were uneasy outside the forest , which ended a little farther east . As a result they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement might be a threat of massacre , even a drift of cloudshadow across the edge of the plain . Let anyone come in sight above the horizon or along the edge of an oak grove , let a horse stumble in the brush or leave a hoofprint in the mud of the riverbank , let a squaw have a painful dream or a bird dart low over a cook fire ? it was enough to start the women screaming and digging foxholes and the braves running in circles and firing muskets at the sky . There were Sioux to he afraid of ; they were now coming to the Red , their ancient war road , from  | the south as well as from the east . But the Chippewas suffered fifty alarms per possible Sioux . A party would leave the vicinity of the post for a hunt , or just on one of its seasonal wanderings , and come stampeding back because someone had heard something . A child playing by the river heard an unfamiliar bird call and everybody got ready to die ? but played it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone could start a panic by merely remarking to someone else that he had a notion the Sioux were coming . The Red River , the Assiniboine , the Saskatchewan , and their tributaries swarmed with fish . Even the flabby sucker was eaten but the staples were whitefish , catfish , and sturgeon . In the spring sturgeon were so thick that the canoes practically grounded on them and they were big fish , fifty , sixty , up to a hundred and fifty pounds . As soon as the spring floods receded ? then as now they inundated hundreds of square miles ? you began to seine sturgeon or stretched nets a hundred yards long from bank to bank . Promptly the change from a meat diet gave everyone dysentery . Spring and fall , such flights of ducks , geese , and swans as no one will ever see again darkened the sky . Pelicans , cormorants , the eagles which the Indians trapped , many other populous species of water and land birds stayed all year . Grouse and quail were as numerous as the fleas you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body with welts . There were even more bears . Grizzlies came hurtling out of the brush on their inexplicable , manic sprint but the regional infestation was black bears , which were everywhere . You could shoot them from horseback , or on the way to the river , or while strolling in the evening . " Bears make prodigious ravages in the brush and willows ; the plum trees are torn to pieces and every tree that bears fruit has shared the same fate ; the tops of the oaks are also very roughly handled , broken , and torn down to get the acorns . . . their dung lies about in the woods as plentiful as that of the buffalo in the meadows . " Henry raised a cub to maturity . The dogs got along with it amiably and it followed the engages across the plain and through the groves . When winter came on it refused to hibernate in the holes Henry dug for it , insisting on scooping out its own den . A bear carcass tried out many gallons of oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a clear fat that kept indefinitely , a good seasoning or soup stock or even a meal in itself . It was a necessity to the Indians ' personal life , a foundation cream for paint , a pomatum for the hair , a remedy for all distempers , and a sacred ointment which when rubbed on the body gave them a bear 's ferocity and an odor that traveled ahead of them for some distance . Buffalo tallow , which had to be boiled too , was even more valuable . It was indispensable for pemmican but could also be eaten like bread or as a dessert . In the winter cuts and sides of buffalo were frozen and hung in the ice-house ? every post had one which was filled as soon as the river and lakes froze . " Piece meat " would not last long in warm weather , so there were always drying stages where it was hung for jerky or pemmican . The squaws brought in many kinds of greens , savories , berries , and fruits . They gathered the " prairie turnip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long twists that hung from the lodgepoles like onions in your grandmother 's cellar . ( Psoralea esculenta and related species ; it was , the white man reported , " windy . " ) The Sioux and some other neighboring tribes thought dog meat a delicacy but white men fell back on it only in starving times . Best castrate a male as soon as it was killed , to prevent a rank taste . The great buffalo plains began here ; winter or summer there were usually herds at no great distance . A tall oak near Henry 's post served him as a watchtower . Climbing it , he could see a dozen small herds on their slow way nowhither or in the rutting season herds too big to be counted , moving like the tide , shaking the earth , bellowing all day and all night . The Indians were always hunting for meat , hides , and the innumerable byproducts . The Crees , however , were indifferent leatherworkers and the Assiniboins clumsy , which meant business for the skilled tribes of the upper Missouri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin tipis but clung to their traditional bark lodges , here where trees were much scarcer than bulls . Buffalo were so easily killed that white men found the sport dull ; horses were still uncommon and so they did not get the drama of the chase . One novelty the Indians practiced was to drive them out on the ice when it grew rotten toward spring , and bunch them till they broke through it and drowned ; they floated downstream under the ice and at the  | next opening squaws dragged them out . When the ice started to break up they drowned innumerably and as they decomposed became a delicacy for Indian gourmets , who thought buffalo meat best when it turned green and began to liquefy . At the end of March , " great numbers of dead buffalo from above , " and two weeks later , " drowned buffalo still drifting down the river but not in such vast numbers as before . " Henry found the stench along the river intolerable and on the way to one of his posts had to skip supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of May , John Macdonnell spent a day counting them . He made it " 7360 drowned and mired along the river thirty miles at most and in it . . . in one or two places I went on shore and walked from one carcass to the other , where they lay from three to five files deep . " . . . Prairie fires were just as hard on them . " Blind buffalo seen every moment wandering about . The poor beasts have all the hair singed off them ; even the skin in many places is shrivelled up and terribly burned , and their eyes are swollen and closed fast . It was really pitiful to see them staggering about , sometimes running afoul of a large stone , at other times tumbling down hill and falling into creeks . . . . In one spot we found a whole herd lying dead . " But good roast buffalo , if you got there before the wolves . Above the Qu'Appelle streams might freeze as early as midOctober ; below there they were sure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze till December . Winter closed in with blizzards and abysmal cold spells . ( Worst along the Missouri , where for three weeks or more at a time the temperature might not rise to twenty below . ) Firewood had been stacked ? 120 cords for four fireplaces at Park River ? but winter was the time to cut it for next year . All jobs were welcome , meat-making , ice-harvesting , repair and renovation , blacksmithing , whatever could be thought up , for boredom closed in too . The engages went coasting on the sledges that were used for hauling wood , the squaws joining in this odd white man 's sport , and the ice games of Canada , Scotland , and the Indians produced strange mixtures of skills . It was a time for hair-raising kinds of hunting and marksmanship contests , for anything that would break the dull , dead-level stretches when the snow and ice deepened and the sun might  | not show itself for days at a time . " The country affords no tallow for candles nor fish oil for lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read or work by . " There was not much to read ; word that someone had a different book would make a man travel a hundred miles , risking blizzards and mal-deraquette ( the agonizing strain produced in tendons by unskillful or too violent snowshoeing ) to borrow it . There was great satisfaction when a bitch in heat brought the wolf packs around or the post dogs boiled out after a bitch wolf . " Some of my men have amused themselves by watching their motions in the act of copulation ; rushing upon them with an axe or club , when the dog , apprehending no danger , would remain quiet and the wolf , unable to run off , could be despatched . " Any Indian ceremony that involved dancing was welcome , and most ceremonies did . If it also involved a medicine man 's prestidigitation it had the drawing power of a Broadway opening . The magicians were good . They turned leather belts to snakes which coiled and rattled , then turned them back to leather . They had themselves bound with sinew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moose or buffalo robe and again bound with rawhide , and inclosed in a small tent from which , after the spirits had howled for a while , they emerged unbound to take a bow . They swallowed broken arrows and coughed up whole ones , cleft each other 's skulls with hatchets , sawed the beautiful wench in two , and fired a dozen bullets or thrust a spear through her . She bled gallons and " the spectator really believes that he sees the feathers gradually enter and the arrow , all bloody , come out on the other side , under the shoulder blade . " It was easy to believe things in winter . The windigo walked the frozen snowfields , the spectral cannibal who terrified Indians and made a winterer 's spine crawl when a gale out of the north shook the fort at midnight . The Qu'Appelle 's spirit wailed . Up at Lake Isle-a-la-Crosse Mr. Grame told John McDonald of Garth that in the light of a full moon he had seen a coach drawn by two white horses drive toward him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake ; one day next spring they found his canoe at the mouth of that creek but they did not find Mr. Grame , for the coach had taken him away . At Rocky Mountain House even the steel-nerved Alexander  | Mackenzie wrote to his cousin Roderic that he could hardly bear the dreams he had . At Cumberland House Mr. Hallet bade Mr. King , who was going on a journey , beware of La Mothe , thus amusing Mr. King a great deal for La Mothe was a clerk and in the Hudson 's Bay Company caste was caste . The second night he was gone Mr. King 's little girl ( of course a halfbreed ) told her mother , " There is my father at the foot of the bed , his neck all red .

" On her first voyage , " Morison says , " the Columbia . . . solved the riddle of the China trade . On her second , empire followed in her wake . " 3 On the second voyage she had as fifth mate a Bostonian named John Boit , with a nasal twang that got into his prose style ; he was six months short of eighteen when she cruised the Oregon coast in the spring of 1792 . His admiration of his captain , Robert Gray , was governable ? none of Gray 's mates of record thought he was a good mariner but the facts refute them ? and he had not liked being ordered to burn the village at Clayoquot Sound , a few miles south of Nootka Sound , as punishment for the Indians ' attempt to capture the Columbia and massacre its crew . Leaving Clayoquot in the spring she coasted southward , stopping to trade with various tribes who had a lot of furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern boundary of Oregon she turned north again . Boit 's journal entry for April 22 1792 records a latitude of 46 ? 39 ' and says , " Still beating about , in pursuit of anchorage . Sent the boat in shore often , but cou 'd find no safe harbour ... . Experience strong currents setting to the southward . We have frequently seen many appearances of good harbours , but the Currents and squally weather hindered us from a strict examination however Capt . Gray is determin 'd to persevere in the pursuit . " Six days later , April 28 , Boit says , " this day spoke his Brittanic Majestey 's Ships Discovery and Chatham , commanded by Capt . George Vancover and Lieutenant W. Broughton , from England on a voyage of discovery . And to receive from the Spanish commandant at Nootka a small hut and some supposititious acreage , in token of contrition for a useful if uncommitted insult to British honor . . . we gave them all the information in our power , especially as respected the Straits of Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by others before Gray which they was then in search of . " Captain Vancouver did not visit the Columbia himself but sent his Lieutenant Puget and the naturalist Menzies instead . Returning to the Discovery , they reported Gray as saying that he had sailed only fifty miles into the Strait of Juan de Fuca and not all the way round the island now called Vancouver , which was what had been reported in England . " He likewise  | informed them , " Vancouver 's narrative says under date of April 29 , " of his having been off the mouth of a river in the latitude of 46 ? 10 ' , where the outset , or reflex , was so strong as to prevent his entering for nine days . Nine days mean Gray 's summary of his efforts to find a harbor , not to enter this particular one . This was , probably , the opening passed by us on the forenoon of the 27th ; and was , apparently , inaccessible , not from the current but from the breakers that extended across it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were across the mouth of Deception Bay , with Cape Disappointment , which was Heceta 's Cape San Roque , at its northern extremity . The new names had been bestowed by John Meares , a former British naval officer who had first come to the Northwest coast to trade for sea otter in 1786 . A first-rate navigator , sometimes on the gray side of the law , and a vivid but unreliable chronicler , Meares had set out in 1788 to check Heceta 's statement that he had seen the mouth of a river there . The breakers had convinced him that Heceta was wrong , that " we can now with safety assert that no such river as that of St. Roc exists , as laid down in the Spanish charts . " As against a Yankee , Vancouver would stand on the judgment of a British officer . He himself , the day before his ship spoke the Columbia , had identified Deception Bay and Cape Disappointment from Meares 's description . He wrote , " The sea had now changed from its natural to a river-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay , or into the ocean from the north of it , through the coastal lowland . Not considering this opening worthy of more attention , I continued our pursuit to the n . " The Yankee had been taken in by appearances . The Columbia continued northward and on May 7 sighted an entrance that Gray could get into . Boit says , " The Ship stood in for the weather bar and we soon see from the Mast head a passage in between the breakers . " So they entered the big indentation of the Washington coast that has been called Gray 's Harbor ever since , anchored , and began to trade with Indians who " was stout made and very ugly . " They were also charged with the antipathy to sea captains that the tribes had been learning for seven years . The next day " heard the hooting  | of Indians , all hands was immediately under arms , " and those who first ventured close got muskets fired over their heads and withdrew . But " at Midnight we heard them again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see the Canoes approaching to the ship . " Gray fired a warning cannon but " at length a large Canoe with at least 20 Men in her got within 1/9 pistol shot of the quarter , and with a Nine pounder loaded with langerege and about 10 Musketts , loaded with Buck shot , we dash 'd her all to pieces , and no doubt kill 'd every soul in her . " The Northwest trade had its ruggedness : you killed a large percentage of the customers in order to do business with the rest on terms you considered proper . When the Columbia left Gray 's Harbor , she headed south for the river which Gray had been unable to enter the month before , and it was ready to happen now . Boit for May 12 1792 : N. Latt. 46 ? 7 ' W. Long . 122 ? 47 ' . This day saw an appearance of a spacious harbour abrest the Ship , haul 'd our wind for itt , observ 'd two sand bars making off , with a passage between them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and followed with the Ship under short sail , carried in from t , /2 three to 7 fathom , and when over the bar had 10 fathom Water quite fresh . . . . The river at this place the anchorage was about 4 miles over . We purchas 'd 4 Otter Skins worth five hundred dollars in China goods at Canton for a Sheet of Copper , Beaver Skins 2 spikes each , and other land furs , 1 Spike each . And the Columbia 's log : At four A. M. , saw the entrance of our desired port bearing eastsouth-east , distance six leagues ; in steering sails , and hauled our wind in shore . At eight , A. M. , being a little to windward of the Harbor , bore away , and run in east-north-east between the breakers , having from five to seven fathoms of water . When we were over the bar , we found this to be a large river of fresh water , up which we steered . ... At one , p . M. , came to with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white sand . . . . Vast numbers of natives came alongside ; people employed in pumping the salt water out of our water-casks , in order to fill with fresh , while the ship floated in . So ends . So ends a very great deal : Gray had sailed into the great river that Bruno Heceta had sighted . He named it Columbia 's River ; the possessive did not last . And with the events so  | simply narrated much else begins . In the last year of Washington 's first term , Mr. Thomas Jefferson being Secretary of State , the Republic had flown its flag in the river of the West . The Western lodestone intensified its tug as the voltage of a current is stepped up by an induction coil , and for the second time the hard Yankee captain had greatly served his country . In doing so he displayed the attributes of American traders and sea captains which , with the help of the East India Company 's restrictions , soon enabled them to take the Northwest trade entirely away from the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as what it was , the mouth of a river , and then insisted on entering it , succeeding on his second trial . Vancouver saw the same signs and identified " rivercolored water " but knew that there could be no more than a congeries of creeks hereabout . He was sure that no one could think there was a river which amounted to anything except a " theoretical geographer " who believed in a mythical " mediterranean sea , " a Sea of the West . ( He was using language he had learned from his master James Cook , but Cook 's skepticism had been exercised more critically . ) Therefore there would be no point in investigating and he went about his business as he saw it . Gray would not be deceived or accept disappointment without having a try at it . So he gave the United States a claim recognized by the polity of nations . Discovery and entrance of a river mouth gave the discovering nation sovereignty over the valley and watershed of the river and over the adjacent coast . The two empires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perimeter had met on the Pacific shore . Inland Great Britain was far in the lead ? but the Americans had reached Oregon first . Vancouver went on to the Strait of Juan de Fuca . The English captain William Barkley had discovered and named it in 1787 , Meares who knew of Barkley 's discovery had seen it the next year and blandly claimed to have discovered and traversed it , and Gray ( in 1791 ) and at least two Spanish mariners before him had entered it . Two Spanish ships were charting some of the related waters when Vancouver sailed up it now . He met them in the Strait of Georgia , which he named but which the Spanish had entered the year before , and here he missed another river . He went on to make the first entrance into Puget  | Sound , which he named for one of his lieutenants . He thoroughly explored it , sometimes in the company of the two Spanish mariners . He set up a counter-induction for the westering empires by claiming all his discoveries for Great Britain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent . In September , after sailing round his island , Vancouver was back at Nootka , where Gray had meanwhile put in after a profitable trip up the coast . The Spanish commandant , Bodega y Cuadra , told Vancouver that Gray had found a river at Deception Bay after all and gave him a copy of Gray 's chart . He sailed south to investigate , though sure that the Yankee could have found only a small river at best . The Columbia confirmed him a little in that the water at the bar which caused the breakers was not as deep as it had been in the spring flood . He sent Lieutenant Broughton in the brig Chatham over the bar on October 19 1792 but found no channel he thought it safe to take the Discovery into and two days later sailed for California . Broughton found that it could not be called a small river and decided that Gray had not entered it . Gray 's chart showed that he had gone thirty-six miles upstream . By triangulation , computation , and divination Broughton scaled this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river had not narrowed enough to be called anything but a sound . A fresh-water sound that opened on the ocean would be unusually interesting geography but it would do to peg down an imperial claim . Broughton anchored in what he took to be one of Gray 's anchorages and went on by small boat to a total of a hundred miles above the bar , almost to the mountains and with the river shoaling to three fathoms . That ought to do it , and the names he gave to peaks and other landmarks ought to stick . He claimed for Great Britain the river Gray had named , all its watershed , and the adjacent coast . Vancouver accepted his findings , " having every reason to believe that the subjects of no other civilized nation or state had ever entered this river before . " So did British diplomacy down to 1846 . Two expanding empires had now made claim to the Columbia River and the unknown area it drained . For both of them the immediate value was the trade in sea otter furs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade with the Columbia 's  | earlier voyage to this coast.4 John Ledyard 's earliest inheritors were British ; the first one to reach the coast for sea otter skins to take to China got there in 1785 . The ship cleared from China and in 1786 there were others from Bengal , Bombay , and England . They were by or by leave of the East India Company , a chartered monopoly like the Hudson 's Bay Company . The market for furs , Canton , was in its territory . The trouble it could cause independents , the tribute it could extract from them , and the delays and expedients necessary to circumvent it were a force in the loss of the Northwest trade to the United States . But Great Britain would have lost it anyway , for the great American maritime age had begun and ships out of Boston , Salem , Philadelphia , New York , and the Chesapeake ports were outsailing the British in all the seas . The Yankees had already made much headway in the China trade by 1788 , only four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Columbia reached Nootka for the first time . She was then captained by John Kendrick , Gray having her tender , the sloop Lady Washington . They had been sent out by a group of Boston merchants to trade in the pattern that Cook 's successor King had sketched out . The ships spent the winter of 1788 ? 89 at Nootka . ( The first President of the United States under the Constitution took the oath of office April 30 1789 . ) The following summer Kendrick , staying behind in the sloop , put the furs they had acquired into the Columbia and turned her over to Gray . Gray took her to Canton , exchanged the furs for tea , sailed round the Cape of Good Hope , thus making the first American circumnavigation of the globe , and reached Boston in August 1790 . Toward the end of the Columbia 's winter stay the Americans had witnessed the incidents that produced the " Nootka Sound Controversy . " Vancouver Island , which was not yet so named , was Spanish and all ships that touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( This was quite clear and the East India Company acted in accordance with it , sending its first ventures there under the flag of Portgual , which had treaty privileges . ) In 1788 Meares built some earthworks and a shack  | on a site which he claimed to have bought from the local chief for two pistols , and announced that he was setting up in business . In the spring of 1789 the Spanish commandant seized the shack , searched , seized , and released several British ships , and ended by again seizing several ? one of which belonged to Meares ? and keeping them . Since the great value of the Northwest trade was now understood , the British government demanded restitution , reparation , and recognition of the right to trade . Spain answered with a demand that her sovereignty be acknowledged . It was an explosive situation in a jittery world and would have led to war ? but the beginning of the French Revolution had cut off the possibility of French help and Spain had no choice but to accede to the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growing likelihood that the two nations might have to combine against the destroyers of legitimate dynasties had convinced the British that it was desirable to take no further advantage of the situation so opportunely created . Vancouver 's expedition to the Northwest coast was intended purely for exploration but his instructions had recognized the possibility that he might be called on to officiate at the ceremonies of Spanish penitence . He was , and Spain named Cuadra to perform them in place of the commandant who had committed the original offense . They were conducted with operatic courtliness and a vast mutual consideration , in so much that when both representatives found that their instructions could not be carried out as written , they agreed to refer the questions to their governments , forgot about them , and got on with the agreeable business of exploring the coast . They became so friendly that Vancouver temporarily forgot he was a sea dog and named the land he had sailed round Cuadra and Vancouver Island . Thus Spain abandoned her claim to exclusive sovereignty over Nootka Sound . In effect she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VI drew his demarcation line in 1493 , and the breakup of the Spanish Empire had begun . The Spanish concession had the utmost importance for the United States . California remained entirely Spanish but how far north did California extend ? The Republic began to engross the Northwest trade and , as the wars of the French  | Revolution developed , went on to appropriate a steadily increasing part of the world 's carrying business . Though it was so weak a political and military power that the crises of the 1790 's seemed likely to break it up , it was becoming a great maritime nation . The biggest business it was engaged in was the triangular trade with China . This was based on the Northwest coast , and the Northwest coast was the width of the continent away from the seaboard cities . From now on no American statesman and no continental thinker could forget for a moment that Spanish Louisiana lay between the western boundary of the United States and Captain Gray 's river . Vancouver 's instructions from the Admiralty were dated March 8 1791 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland to get schooling for his final exploration . He did not arrive in time for the Admiralty to share the knowledge he had acquired on his descent of the Mackenzie River . He had , and was always to retain , confused and erroneous ideas about the great mountain ranges that had shut the West away from him as he traveled toward the Arctic . But he did know that those mountains existed and he conjectured that , somehow , they were continuous with the Rockies , about which his North West Company partners had extremely confused ideas . When the Admiralty planned Vancouver 's exploration it had only North West Company ideas about the mountains . It pretty thoroughly disregarded them and accepted worse ones . Some of the Admiralty 's intentions must be quoted . Vancouver 's first objective was to acquire " accurate information with respect to the nature and extent of any water-communication which may tend , in any considerable degree , to facilitate an intercourse , for the purpose of commerce , between the northwest coast and the country upon the opposite side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's subjects . " This was a clear recognition of the most advanced North West Company ideas , those of Pond , the elder Alexander Henry , and Mackenzie . The fur trade of the interior was to be given a continental connection with the maritime fur trade , the North West Company with the Northwest coast . The connection was to be by the venerable hope , a " water-communication . " It would be " of great importance , " the document went on , if  | Vancouver should find " any considerable inlets of the sea , or even large rivers , communicating with the lakes in the interior of the continent . " This either erased the mountain barrier or cut a wide and useful corridor through it , and there was no Continental Divide or at most one you could carry a canoe across . That the Admiralty 's geographers meant exactly what the words say is patent in the direction to disregard any opening too small for him to sail his ship up . They had the rumor that Gray in the Lady Washington had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the big island north of it , thus proving that it actually was an island . Vancouver was to determine whether this could in fact be done . And " the discovery of a near communication between any such sea or strait , and any river running into or from the lake of the woods would be particularly useful . " For " lake of the woods " read Lake Winnipeg , and note " into or from . " This allows for the possibility that a short portage between Atlantic and Pacific drainage may be required . Nevertheless , in 1791 it still seems to England 's best geographers wholly likely that a River of the West may flow directly from the interior to the Pacific . They knew that the Saskatchewan flowed into Lake Winnipeg at its northern end by way of Cedar Lake and the Assiniboine at its southern end by way of Red River . Both these were known to be big eastward-flowing rivers and they must come down from somewhere . Yet a river may flow west to the ocean from Lake Winnipeg , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plains southwest of it between the Assiniboine and the Missouri , which also flows east . For all that had been learned since Verendrye , and that knowledge stretched to the Rockies and the Arctic , this is the same possibility that was hidden in the unknown when he headed west from Rainy Lake . The Rocky Mountains had not impressed their factual existence on the thinkers in London . The Admiralty alludes to another route , the one Peter Pond had worked out by postulate and deduction . If Vancouver should find no such continental water route south of Cook 's River , " there is the greatest probability that it will be found that the said river rises in some of the lakes already known to the Canadian traders and to the servants of the Hudson 's Bay  | Company . " ( Lake Athabaska , Great Slave Lake , Great Bear Lake ? Possibly a northwestern outlet of the Lake Winnipeg complex ? And on the basis of what the traders and servants had learned by now , just how ? ) Vancouver is to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the geographers hope it wo n't run to that . " The discovery of any similar communication more to the southward ( should any such exist ) would be much more advantageous for the purposes of commerce , and should therefore be preferably attended to . " There was no water route leading to the interior for Vancouver to find . There was no gap in the Rockies , no mountainwalled Northwest Passage to Lake Winnipeg or anywhere else . There was , however , something notable which he might have found but did n't . He simply was not a lucky man with rivers . Following the commandant 's seizure of ships at Nootka , the Spanish busied themselves exploring the related waters under the direction of Francisco Eliza . Early in 1792 one of his captains by the name of Narvaez followed the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the Strait of Georgia and turned up that . Off its eastern shore , the continental coast , he saw what he took to be unmistakable signs of a river and judged that it must be a big one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in May two more of Eliza 's ships , whose captains were named Galiano and Valdes , reached the same mud flats that he had been passing when he saw his signs . " We were already in water which was almost fresh , " the report reads , " and we saw floating on it large logs , which indications confirmed us in the idea that the bay which we called Floridablanca the name Narvaez had given it was the estuary of a considerable river . " 5 On June 22 Vancouver met them in these selfsame waters and showed them his sketches for a chart . " They seemed much surprised that we had not found a river " and pointed to the location of their Floridablanca . He was not impressed . He had been there only nine days before and had described the coast as " very low land , apparently a swampy flat " and had seen no such significance as they had in beached " logs of wood and trees innumerable . " So he had missed another river , as he had missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused mouths , but no one would know anything about it for sixteen years more . Then Simon Fraser would descend it and bequeath it  | his name . The city named Vancouver includes that swampy mud flat now . In 1793 , after making valuable surveys elsewhere Vancouver was on the coast north of Vancouver Island . On June 3 his small boats made soundings in an inlet and he called " the canal we had thus explored Dean 's Canal . " It is Dean Channel on modern maps . They were six weeks too early to witness an arrival that would have astonished them . On July 20 , in a large , leaky canoe manned by coastal Indians Alexander Mackenzie came down one of the arms of the Bella Coola River and out into salt water in Dean Channel . The problem of the United States was elementary : to survive . To survive the clash of domestic interests and philosophies , the rivalries of states and the resistances of citizens unused to a federal government , and conspiracies in New England and west of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive British , French , and Spanish efforts to destroy the nation by breaking it up from within , by making war on it , or by getting it involved in war . To survive the hazards created by the French Revolution , which kept the world at war for a quarter of a century and might have destroyed the Republic in almost any month . The dangers were orchestrated to a climax in 1794 . Thereafter there was some confidence that they might be contained but most of them remained threatening through the rest of the decade . From posts maintained on American soil and protected by the garrisons of illegal forts , British traders dealt with American Indians and crossed Wisconsin and Minnesota to trade illegally with Spanish Indians . At the time of the Nootka incident Washington and his Cabinet had to consider the possibility that Great Britain would request permission to march an army across the American West to take Natchez ( illegally held by the Spanish ) , West Florida , New Orleans , and indeed all Louisiana . Or that it might make the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire on our western as well as our northern flank . And from the Great Lakes posts , both north and south of the boundary , the governors of Canada  | and the military commanders continually incited the Indians to make war on the Americans and supplied them with munitions . The minimum hope ? preached to the Indians , discussed with other foreign offices , and agitated by the underground ? was to keep all the lands north of the Ohio River an Indian Country . That is , to make it a buffer state between the British and American empires , empty of Americans , populated by Indians who would be tributary to British sovereignty and British trade . The full hope was to attach these lands to Canada when the next war should come . Some thirty thousand emigrants , sprung from God knew where , were crossing the mountains every year . Only a few of them settled north of the Ohio and these few mostly at Marietta and Cincinnati : the everlasting Indian war made settlement elsewhere impossible . The principal tribes engaged were emigre Iroquois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piankeshaws and the Wyandots , the Kickapoos , the Miamis , and always the Shawnees . They had it pretty much their own way . The Kentucky frontier could not sustain lengthy operations . Under the Articles of Confederation the national military establishment had withered away . The Republic organized only a feeble and bad one . Neither the Americans nor the Indians would make a treaty in good faith ; both knew they never would . In 1790 General Josiah Harmar led a kind of militia army against the Shawnees along the Scioto and on to the confederated tribes near the Maumee . He destroyed some abandoned villages and much stored grain , won some skirmishes , lost bigger ones , and failed so badly that the West seemed lost . ( In Canada officials interpreted the expedition as a first move to repossess the illegally held posts , prepared for war , and increased the flow of supplies to the warring tribes . ) In 1791 Arthur St. Clair , who had been a general in the Revolution and was now Governor of the Northwest Territory , blundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Miami chief Little Turtle shattered his forces , killed some six hundred of them , and dispersed the rest in panic . These were mostly regulars ; the Republic 's first army had begun by suffering the most humiliating defeat Americans had ever taken . The Indians , coached by their backers , announced that the United States did not exist west of the Cuyahoga and the Muskingum ? Cleveland and Cincinnati .  | The British minister refused to discuss the return of the Western posts ; the boundaries of the newly created department of Upper ( western ) Canada were left undefined . Washington and Knox raised a new army , calling Mad Anthony Wayne from retirement to command it . Kentucky became the fifteenth state in 1792 ? Vermont had been admitted a year earlier ? but there was no warranty it would stay in the union . Not until Napoleon 's more dynamic empire took over Louisiana did Thomas Jefferson write his famous aphorism , " There is on the globe one single spot , the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our territory must pass to market and from its fertility it will ere long yield more than half our whole produce and contain more than half our inhabitants . " But he was saying the same thing in other words as early as 1790 , and indeed the truth was selfevident . The existence of the United States as an economic entity west of the mountains depended on water transportation , the Mississippi , and on free access to the ocean , the mouth of the Mississippi . The endless procession of emigrants on horseback or in Conestoga wagons , in broadhorns , keelboats , scows , flatboats and more unlikely craft , kept building up a tension that was certain to explode . There is no space here to analyze or even to list the various movements , plots , and conspiracies that the tension created : to seize New Orleans or break the Spanish stranglehold by some other means , to detach the West from the United States and set up a separate nation that could make its own terms or its own war with Spain , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Canada and the British Empire . But they boiled furiously , in high places and low , agitated by statesmen and adventurers , frontier floaters and the secret agents of three powers . There was a multitude of military schemes , commercial ventures , land speculations , and efforts of the imperial undergrounds to trap the new nation in a war that would destroy it . The Kentuckians were the first half-horse , half-alligator Americans , nature 's premature attempt to create Texans . They viewed their fellow countrymen and the foreigners across the river with equally contemptuous disregard . Of the plots to settle the issue by force some used , and more tried to use , George Rogers Clark . The hero 's hour had passed ; bankrupt ,  | his just claims unpaid , all his land speculations unsound , he slipped into gaudy imperial fantasies , drunkenness , and sedition . But westward expansion was as implicit in him as courage and he remained a great name on the frontier . He had already suffered betrayal from a lifelong betrayer of everyone , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilkinson was the focus , or front , of many feints and plots to make the West Spanish . He had already converted Spanish faith in his power and connections into a steady source of income , had got valuable commercial privileges at New Orleans as a bait to lure the West into revolution , and was and would remain on the Spanish payroll as a conspirator and spy . He had been in the Revolutionary army ? good script-writing attached him to the Quebec expedition with Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr ? and he had usually held some military or political appointment ever since . Now he joined up as Wayne 's second in command and of course began to intrigue against Wayne . While Wayne 's army was training , in 1793 , the governor of Louisiana ( Carondelet ) wrote to his chief that the Americans were " advancing with incredible rapidity toward the north and the Mississippi and they will beyond doubt force Spain to recognize the Misuri as their boundary within a short time . Perhaps they will even pass that river " unless decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable ? to arrest American expansion , if not at the Alleghanies then somewhere east of the Mississippi . Behind this imperial necessity there was , besides the actual American threat , a wholly fantastic fear ? of military action against Santa Fe as a step toward the conquest of northern Mexico , where the silver mines were . Those mines had to be defended from St. Louis , San Luis de Ylinoia , as they were being defended from San Francisco Bay . The reports of the Spanish governors , lieutenant-governors , and army officers sandwich Santa Fe between proposals to fortify the east bank of the Mississippi and to keep the Civilized Tribes raiding Tennessee.6 Spanish policy was largely conspiratorial , involving a network of espionage agents , agitators , and suborned American officials . This underground cost much more than it was worth , spread across the West , and extended into the American Congress . Policy also kept in a state of exacerbated impotence the negotiations about the boundary between the United States  | and East and West Florida , employing the Spanish genius for inconclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war against the American settlements which though less continuous than that north of the Ohio was sometimes even bloodier . But the most effective weapon was manipulation of the right to navigate the Mississippi : threatening to close the river , closing it , opening it a little for purposes of bribery and subornation , keeping full privileges constantly before Western eyes as a threat and a promise . To his contemporaries Thomas Jefferson did not seem a bemused ideologue , the role that one of our most durable literary traditions has cast him in . His opponents thought of him as the embodiment of realism and even opportunism , as pragmatism 's pope . " Spain is so evidently picking a quarrel with us that we see a war absolutely inevitable with her . " Or at least war was inevitable and " we should keep ourselves free to act in this case according to circumstances . " The world of the early 1790 's was a powder magazine on fire and the flames were spreading . On the outbreak of any war the United States would immediately seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jefferson knew as much and said so . If a war with Spain should break out we would win it , but it would provide a tempting opportunity for France or Great Britain to attack us and was therefore ? up to a point ? to be avoided . In 1790 as Secretary of State he was willing , in return for the cession of the Floridas and New Orleans , to guarantee Louisiana against British aggression . This was , however , purely because the Nootka incident might enable Great Britain to " completely encircle us with her colonies &; fleets , " and when the tension abated he repudiated such a guarantee , which was against his instinct and the whole set of his mind. ? And " were we to give up half our territory rather than engage in a just war to preserve it , we should not keep the other half long . " He wanted to acquire the island of New Orleans but would settle ? though only temporarily ? for freedom of navigation on the Mississippi and the right of deposit at or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increasing population in the West to force one or the other solution peacefully ( though down to 1793 he would have had only formal objections if the Westerners had gone filibustering ) but knew that if that pressure came to a head , the government could not wait  | upon peace . " The nail will be driven as far as it will go peaceably , and farther the moment that circumstances become favorable . " The West in domestic politics may be oversimplified as : Federalist interests , themselves in part separatist as regarded New England , were antiexpansionist and remained tranquil about Western separation , though not so passive as the Republican West believed . ( Jay 's despairing proposal to settle the long negotiation by conceding the closure of the Mississippi for a period of years , which really would have amputated the West , met opposition in his own party . ) Domestic divisions were intensified , complicated , and confused by the French Revolution . Enthusiasm for the overthrow of despotism and what seemed the extension of our own Revolution by the people who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even New England , till 1793 . But the news that Citizen Capet 's head had dropped into the sack produced widespread revulsion . The ships that brought it had hardly docked when others arrived with word that the French Republic had declared war on Holland , Great Britain , and Spain . World war instantly made the chronic crisis acute . At any moment the United States might be forced into war with France , Spain , or Great Britain . With the last two , thus made allies , our relations were already at the breaking point . Postponement of war from day to day while such power as the nation had could be mobilized and some adjustment of the dangers worked out was an absolute necessity . Little more than a month after news of the war arrived American foreign policy was given the base it would retain for more than a century . Washington , backed by the two arch-realists in his Cabinet , Hamilton and Jefferson , issued the Declaration of Neutrality . Before it was published , a minister from France landed at Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever represented a nation anywhere . Genet was charged with launching the United States into war with Spain and if possible Great Britain . He and the Committee of Public Security that was governing France ( presently superseded by the Committee of Public Safety ) apparently expected the United States to become unanimously Girondist if not Jacobin . When it did not immediately do so , Genet undertook to overthrow the government by crying a rescue to the  | people . His inflammatory foolishness discredited him before he reached Philadelphia and presently it was easy to demand his recall . ( In fear of the guillotine , he stayed here and made a rich marriage . ) Meanwhile he had made war with Great Britain all but certain by commissioning American vessels as French privateers and basing a campaign against British shipping on American ports . Also he spun an espionage network across the West and commissioned Americans in the French army to raise forces for the conquest of the Floridas , Louisiana , and perhaps Canada . George Rogers Clark thus became a major general of France and in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper army of conquest . The situation worsened as 1794 came on . The war had created a glistening commercial opportunity by making the French West Indies dependent on American trade and of necessity also opening the British islands . The British navy seized American vessels to a total of three hundred and so roused the war spirit in New England , which though it was the center of Federalism was also the center of investment in shipping . With one eye on these seizures and the other on Wayne 's now magnificently trained army in the West , the governor of Canada publicly declared that war was inevitable . The Canadian military establishment was increased , the army was readied for the war , and a detachment was sent to build a new fort on American soil squarely in Wayne 's probable path , on the Maumee River . Now domestic turmoil produced what looked like an insurrection . Pennsylvania west of the mountains had mutinously ignored one of Hamilton 's revenue measures , a confiscatory tax on whiskey , the one product that could be transported eastward at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 1794 federal authority was suspended in four counties . The frontiersmen forcibly adjourned the federal courts , raided the mails , and burned the houses of marshals . In August a halforganized mob marched into Pittsburgh , threatened to burn it , and talked ( boastfully , drunkenly , and sometimes in words furnished by Spanish or French agents ) of crossing the mountains for direct action . They confronted the administration , governing a nation unaccustomed to centralized authority , with a challenge which it  | must meet if it was to survive . But they also gave it a priceless opportunity , the chance it had not so far had to reduce the all-inclusive crisis to manageable size . Washington raised an army of 13,000 , only 3000 less than the combined Franco-American force at Yorktown . He named to command it two brilliant Revolutionary generals , Light-Horse Harry Lee and Daniel Morgan , with Hamilton as his personal representative . No such numbers were required to collect an excise . The clue was Pittsburgh , at the forks of the Ohio River , one of the pivotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in an amiable spirit and without punitive action ? and at the Forks of the Ohio there was a large American army to deter Westerners from acting on behalf of France , and to impress conspiratorial Spaniards in New Orleans and belligerent Englishmen in Quebec . Twenty-five hundred of them remained in Pittsburgh , on one route of easy access to Canada , through the winter of 1794-95 , while Wayne with a force nearly twice as large was poised on another invasion route farther west . Meanwhile in August Wayne climaxed a brilliant campaign by breaking Indian power north of the Ohio when he defeated the confederated tribes at Fallen Timbers . Fleeing Indians sought refuge in the new British fort . Its commander had orders to fight if Wayne should attack and Wayne would have attacked if the fort had been opened to the Indians . It was n't ; Wayne by-passed it , cleaned out the countryside , and began an ultimately successful attempt to intimidate and cajole the tribes into submission . The two armies so close to the border were a blatant , very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Canada . Whatever else might happen , the possession of Canada would put the Americans in a formidably strong trading position at the peace conference . Meanwhile it would give them the fur trade . There could hardly have been a more powerful deterrent to the British war party . To prevent war was a necessity for the United States , and through 1793 and the early part of the next year it seemed impossible . The situation had all but hopelessly degenerated in April 1794 when Washington made his final , despairing effort . He sent Chief Justice Jay , a veteran if frequently frustrated diplomat , to England to negotiate the settlement that the American minister had been unable to procure . The negotia-  | tion was set before a backdrop of the world war and the Terror . ( The 9 Thermidor translates as July 27 . ) Fallen Timbers was fought on August 20 , the new army reached Pittsburgh in November , British distaste for the alliance with Spain grew steadily . The result was Jay 's Treaty , which was so offensive to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the debtor tobacco planters ? that Washington feared he could not get it past Congress . But Jay had got from the desperately beset British a good deal more than there was any likelihood he would be able to get . He got the survival of the United States , peace , territorial integrity at last , and the secured and bolstered basis of future power . It was as successful a negotiation as any in our history . Although the West did not at first understand , it was a victory for the West . In a way similarly obscured at first it was a triumph for Jefferson 's ideas too , though he promptly left the Cabinet . As intensely as he wanted anything , the Secretary of State had wanted to get the British off American soil ? out of the Western posts which they had continued to hold and from which they not only incited Indian raids but blockaded a large area to American traders . He could have got this early in the negotiation by accepting the British demand in regard to the northern boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1783 , from the northwest corner of Lake of the Woods west to the Mississippi , was an aberration . Montreal exhausted its political resources to procure a rectification that would make Grand Portage and the canoe route west entirely Canadian , and the British commissioners offered various lines that would join Lake Superior with the Mississippi . Hamilton was willing to sacrifice the canoe route and a portion of Minnesota . Jefferson was not ; he held out , Washington supported him , and Jay got the evacuation anyway.8 But the treaty left a large loophole for the future to rush through . It left the boundary west of Lake of the Woods indeterminate , to be determined by a future commission and survey . The agreement to evacuate the Western posts thirteen years after the original agreement was the core of the treaty . By this agreement Great Britain , saving Canada without having to fight for it , abandoned forever the dream that the country north of the Ohio could be either neutralized or reacquired . It withdrew armed protection from the Mackinac trade across the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it threw its unacknowledged mercenaries , the Indians of the Northwest Territory , to the wolves . However rough on the Indians , this cleared the channel down which the main stream of American development would flow . The treaty had another immediate effect . Thomas Pinckney , dispatched from his post in London to Madrid , got a settlement from Spain which accepted the American definition of the southern boundary , withdrew all but hazardously secret Spanish support from the southern tribes , opened the Mississippi to American commerce , and granted the right of deposit at New Orleans . The Spanish problem , which had risen to a critical peak , now lapsed into mere annoyance . Besides its political and economic denotation , the phrase " territorial integrity " has a meaning that transcends logic . Few Americans knew anything about the Western marches of the United States . Few could imagine them or envisage any future for them apart from spreadeagle rhetoric . Exceedingly few had ever seen them . But insistence that the political organism called the United States must secure inviolate and hold inviolable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else , an embodiment of the continental consciousness . The nation might know little about the boundary that separated it from the Spanish lands but knew that it was a river which could be crossed , and that beyond it the land continuum stretched to the Pacific . In the tense year 1793 , while the unstable equilibrium of international tensions threatened anew every twenty-four hours to break up in war , Thomas Jefferson arranged his first expedition to explore Louisiana . It has ambiguities which the records do not explain and which do not yield to analysis , for the instructions are in good faith but the preparations are perfunctory . Jefferson had only a small part in the preparations and it is not clear to what extent , if any , he ever expected the expedition to succeed . His instructions for the conduct of the expedition were written in April , 9 when the protracted and exasperating negotiations with Spain had deteriorated almost to the point of  | abandonment . This fact is certainly not without bearing on an exploration of Louisiana . But that enterprise had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? by Jefferson perhaps longer than anyone else ? and it was intended to be a peaceful enterprise . Jefferson was acting for an organization that deeply interested him , the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia . Its membership included many of the best minds in the United States , its influence extended throughout the country , and it was interested in the Western wilderness and in the great additions to geographical knowledge that had been made in the last quarter-century . Now it was raising a fund to support a project proposed to it by a French scientist , Andre Michaux . A talented botanist , he had been a resident of the United States for nine years and of South Carolina for seven . He had made wilderness journeys in the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains and the Florida swamps . In 1792 , entering another wilderness , he had followed his botanical specialties through northeastern Canada to the vicinity of Hudson Bay . On his return he proposed to the Philosophical Society " to make discoveries in the Western country " : to travel overland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which harks back to Carver and Rogers and beyond them to Charlevoix , is significant to the utmost . In 1793 the existing knowledge is committed to the Missouri as the best ? and the American ? way west . On March 23 , as Secretary of State , Jefferson wrote to his commissioners who were negotiating with Spain that the government had learned of a proposed French expedition that was to offer independence to the Spanish colonies on the Mississippi . He observed that France would not be displeased if those on the east bank , in particular West Florida , should be added to the United States . On April 30 , as the Philosophical Society 's committeeman , he delivered his instructions for the exploration to Michaux . Earlier in April , his espionage web already spun , the egregious Genet had reached Philadelphia . He promptly enlisted Michaux in the network and , using his well publicized expedition as a front , ordered him to Kentucky to get in touch with Major General George Rogers Clark of the French army and with others , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the government had heard  | in March . Later , on July 5 , Genet told Jefferson , " not as Secy. of state but as Mr. Jeff. , " what he was up to . He was careful to say , falsely , that the army which was to be raised would muster outside American territory . " I told him , " Jefferson wrote in the Anas , " that his enticing officers &; souldiers from Kentucky to go against Spain was really putting a halter about their necks , for that they would assuredly be hung , if they commd. hostilities agt. a nation at peace with the U. S. That leaving out that article , I did not care what insurrections should be excited in Louisiana . " Not even " as Mr. Jeff . " could he say that this might provide the United States with leverage for securing the right of deposit at New Orleans . By making Michaux a secret agent , Genet aborted one more exploration of Louisiana . Michaux left Philadelphia July 15 1793 , his self-esteem so delirious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone knew what he was up to , loafers at crossroads doggeries and the Spanish in New Orleans . His trip through the West had a coloration of Graustark , with innumerable observers reporting every move he made to both the American and the Spanish officials , and innumerable agents of new-budded filibusters and real-estate speculations trying to decide whether he was worth joining . He reached Lexington on September 5 and eventually got to Kaskaskia but got no farther . His great plot was spent and though he was in touch with the French underground in St. Louis he did not even cross the river . Any attempt on New Orleans would have had to be both American and purely on speculation , for Genet lacked funds to support one . Whether the only one that was seriously intended , Clark 's , would have got started in any circumstance is doubtful . The administration took it seriously enough to forbid it , to direct the governor of Kentucky to stop it with militia if it should start , and to order St. Clair to have regular troops ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentuckians were willing to speculate in futures while paying for their own rations , and the principal interest is the unfortunate Clark . He had now engaged in all but one of the possible variations , the Spanish one . He had had visions of conquering New Orleans for the United States , for Kentucky , and for France , and of detaching from the United States the West he had saved for it in order to make it independent and in order to make it French .  | ... In March 1794 Genet 's successor publicly called off the expedition ; it had died of anemia long before . Jefferson 's instructions to Michaux while he still intended to be an explorer express the geographical ideas of the bestinformed American minds in April 1793 . ( The Columbia would not return with news of Gray 's discovery till the end of July . ) Michaux is to " find the shortest and most convenient route of communication between the United States and the Pacific ocean , within the temperate latitudes . " That route , however , is predetermined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it extends , presents itself under circumstances of unquestioned preference . It has , therefore , been declared as a fundamental object of the subscription ( not to be dispensed with ) that this river shall be considered and explored as a part of the communication sought for . " Michaux is to go to the Missouri from Kaskaskia , traveling to the north of St. Louis lest the Spanish stop him . When he reaches it he is to " pursue such of the largest tributaries as shall lead by the shortest way and the lowest latitudes to the Pacific ocean . " ( At this moment the Spanish in St. Louis were preparing their own exploration of the Missouri . The partners of the North West Company were discussing whether they should not do the same thing , and were only three years short of deciding to . Both the Spanish and , at this time , the Northwesters accepted the same hypothesis about the Missouri as Jefferson did . It has to be called a hypothesis for it was worked out by logical interpretation of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a guess based on a mental map of the Missouri which , in 1793 , was still so fantastic that an entirely blank map would have been more useful . ) And mark an assumption which has not been shaken in two centuries , which in fact has been strengthened by late eighteenth-century theorems of symmetrical geography : " When pursuing these streams , you shall find yourself at the point from whence you may get by the shortest and most convenient route to some principal river of the Pacific ocean , you are to proceed to such river and pursue its course to the ocean . " The full assumption is this : the shortest distance between watersheds , and as a corollary therefore the distance most easily to be traveled , is the shortest distance between the headwaters of their principal streams . It is neat and economical ; it is per-  | suasive ; it can be demonstrated by constructing an ideal model of sand or plaster . But it does not happen to be generally true . Jefferson goes on to note that according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri for a considerable distance . " He adds that he and his colleagues know the maps can not be trusted and Michaux must act as the facts he will find out may indicate . But in the thinking of Jefferson and his fellow scientists , two cruxes remain that are unchanged since the discovery of the Missouri . The possibility that the height of land may be wide or may consist of difficult mountain ranges is not imagined , and the Atlantic and Pacific watersheds are assumed actually to interlock . On the day when Michaux , bound toward his Kentucky operetta , reached the foothills of the Alleghanies , the first transcontinental crossing north of Mexico ended at the Pacific shore . Alexander Mackenzie had found a Northwest Passage , albeit a useless one , by land . In the summer of 1792 Mackenzie sent men from Fort Chipewyan ( at Lake Athabaska ) up Peter Pond 's other river , the Peace , to prepare timber for a winter post where the Smoke River empties into it . With a small crew for the post and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though only some six hundred and fifty miles from the Pacific ? since there was a gap in Cook 's observations he could only guess at this distance ? the site was far north , rising 56 ? . That was part of the idea : it was still conceivable that he might be going to reach the ocean by Cook 's River . He had studied Cook and Meares and probably had their books at his winter post . He had all the knowledge the Northwester had amassed , having himself found out the most useful of it . For what it was worth , he had too all the information they had acquired from Indians . He went on questioning Indians through the fall and winter , knowing that none of what he heard was entirely dependable and that he might have badly misunderstood much of it . That , in short , he knew nothing surely about what he was to face . One trouble was that he kept hearing about two big rivers , not one .... He had proved that there was no inland  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed that the River of the West existed , somewhere south of Nootka , perhaps far south . His adjutant was a North West Company clerk of two years ' service , Alexander McKay.10 He also took two veterans of his Mackenzie River journey , four other voyageurs , two Indians for hunters , and a dog . They used a four-fathom ? twenty-fivefoot ? birchbark canoe and their outfit , including goods for presents , weighed three thousand pounds . At seven in the evening May 9 1793 they headed up the Peace River into the unknown and those who stayed at the post " shed tears on the reflection of the dangers which we might encounter . " In late afternoon six days later the snowy peaks of the Rockies rose above the horizon . British traders had seen the Rockies at long intervals as far back as Henday . How far the engages of Niverville had ventured from the westernmost French post just before the French and Indian War is not known , but one Northwester had gone all the way to the foothills . Three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site of Rocky Mountain House where the north branch of the Saskatchewan has become a plains river after issuing from the mountains , Peter Pangman had carved his name on a tree . The tree remained a landmark for years but even Pangman had not entered the Rockies . No white man ever had entered them from the east . Even in the upper stretch Mackenzie had been traveling , the Peace is a big river , frequently a thousand yards wide or more . Now it narrowed and May 19 is a decisive date . On that day his voyageurs took the canoe into Peace River Canyon and the whole complex of skills which had sustained the fur trade for two centuries , and which had brought it from La Chine to the Rockies , collapsed . The voyageurs had mastered all the waters up to here but they had never faced a mountain river . The birchbark canoe is not a craft for mountain streams , which in fact are not navigable . Peace River Canyon is not even in the mountains ; it is a narrow gulch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detached ridge east of the range , a horror where the river is , in Mackenzie 's words , " one white sheet of tumbling water . " They knew nothing to do except to force it as they forced the rapids west of Grand Portage , but they had no resources except will and courage . It came to tow-  |  ing the canoe by handlines with the river hurling gigantic masses of swift and deafening water at them from all directions , and to portaging its lading far up clifliike banks that at every moment threatened them with the loss of their outfit and their lives . They did it in six days , in the unintermitted hazard of death . Few except Mackenzie would have kept on . The six days broke the morale of his crew ; the voyageurs , their tradition rendered impotent , presented two spectacles that were almost inconceivable , terror and rebellion . Even McKay , of the master caste , faltered . Mackenzie held them to the purpose but he himself was in constant fear , not of death but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains and most of the going was just as bad . They met Indians , most of whom had never seen white men and were as dangerous as the river . Mackenzie handled them superbly , though taut with anxiety . In deep canyons where toil and terror were at the extremity , they told him about westward-flowing rivers , the sea beyond , the hostile tribes and the white men on the coast , and their own trade routes ? told him with artistic disregard of the facts . On June 9 he first saw iron that had come up those trade routes from the ships . He had talked with an aged Indian during the preceding year and had been impressed by what he said . When he reached the forks of Peace River , he held by the old man 's instructions and , against appearances and the judgment of all his party , turned up the one that came in from the south , the Parsnip . It was a crucial decision : the other fork , the Finlay , would have led him to a chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so battered that it had to be patched several times a day , meat was scarce in the canyons , every quarterhour had its hazard . On June 12 , paddling across a little lake , they reached the carrying place their guide had described and " found a beaten path over a low ridge of land eight hundred and seventeen paces in length to another small lake . " Here was another climax : the second lake was Pacific water . For the first time north of the tablelands that separate Colorado River drainage from that of the Rio Grande , white men had crossed the Continental Divide . Next day they were in a stream which the second venturer this way , Simon Fraser , would justly name Bad River . Soon it wrecked the canoe and came within a hair of drowning every-  | one . " Every yard on the verge of destruction .... I was on the outside of the canoe where I remained till everything was got on shore , in a state of great pain from the extreme cold of the water . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his satellites but I had not a sufficient horizon , from the propinquity of the mountains . " His steel will , appeals to the voyageurs ' pride as Northmen , and a big slug of rum at the nightly campfire kept them from dissolution . Battered in canyons filled with huge rock fragments , carrying canoe and outfit along cliffs , hip-deep in mud , through woods where axemen had to clear a way , they at last reached a big river . Indian guides ( they were always getting new ones , who were always deserting ) said it flowed west , though for a long distance its course was south or southeast , through canyons that were not majestic but only terrifying . Mackenzie decided that it was one of the rivers he had heard about and thought it might be , at last , the River of the West . . . . It flows down the trough between the Rockies and the Coast Range : the Fraser River . Presently it catapulted them into one of the worst stretches of water in North America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians who were essential to success , the tribe called by ethnologists the Takulli . Their neighbors called them the Carriers ; they cremated their dead and a widow had to carry her husband 's ashes on her back for three years before she could remarry . They spoke a Dene language which Mackenzie and his interpreters , familiar with the kindred Chipewyans , could use ; one of their women was a Cree in whose tongue most Northwesters were fluent . Hostility so vicious that massacre hung in the balance yielded to Mackenzie 's skill ; the Carriers would accept presents and be friends . They said that the river did indeed lead to the sea . They added that he could not go down it by canoe or on foot . Better turn around and go back to the long overland trail which they themselves used . And by the way , the coastal Indians were very terrible ; they would kill his whole party . The crisis had come . Mackenzie was convinced that the river he was on " could not empty itself into the ocean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . " ( It must therefore be that river and its mouth might be as far south as San Francisco Bay . ) So it must be very long , he could see that it was violent to the utrnost , and how could he bring a canoe up it on  | his return ? If he stuck to it there was no possibility that he could get back to Lake Athabaska this year . His supplies , mostly pemmican , were running out ; powder and lead were dangerously low . His men were terrified , had been pleading with him to turn back , had rebelled several times , were on the edge of mutiny , might well slip into the wilderness panic that means death . He himself was hellridden with fear of failure . It seemed to be a full stop . The wilderness had defeated him , and with him the North West Company and Great Britain 's effort to reach the Pacific . But there was one possibility still . Perhaps the overland route through the mountains that the Carriers described did exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't he might take the route and still fail . Not only river craft had broken down when in the person of Alexander Mackenzie the westering white man reached the Rocky Mountains . Geographical thinking had broken down too , its postulates upset , its extrapolations proved worthless . Neither the French , the British , the Spanish , nor the Americans had taken into account the possibility of a considerable land-traverse . A portage of a couple of miles , or up to half a day , might separate the river routes , ocean to ocean , but the watersheds must interlock and travel would always be by canoe . Mackenzie would go to the Pacific . He called his men together and told them he intended to retrace the route to where the land-carry started . If they should fail by that route , as the unreliability of guides made more than possible , then he would come back here and start down this big river and go on to its mouth , " whatever the distance might be . " If the men would not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long portage but would stick to this river now and go down it from this spot . Throw away the scabbard . " At all events , I declared in the most solemn manner , that I would not abandon my design of reaching the sea , if I made the attempt alone , and that I did not despair of returning in safety to my friends . " The measure of Mackenzie is that he enforced his will on a party of men whose private discipline had been undermined by terror of the unfamiliar . The canoe was now worthless ; at the bottom of this ferocious canyon they had the crazy labor of making another one . His about-face alarmed the Carriers who had advised it and for a while they turned hostile again , more  | deadly than diamondbacks . He got back their belief . Upstream then , amid hostile Indians and the threat of mutiny , to the Blackwater River and up that to the portage . They cached supplies , hid the canoe , and made packs ? ninety pounds per man , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first mountainside of the Indian trade route . New guides and pace-setters always appeared in time , the increasingly strange tribes responded to his diplomacy , evidence that he was nearing the ocean and its Indians and its white men multiplied . The forests of the western slope , much rain , much cold and occasional ice , peaks , cliffs , valleys , marshes , lakes ? and ebbing strength as the food ran out . Indians clustered round them now , eaters and worshipers of the salmon . They came down to a river " of the color of asses ' milk " and a village of antic Indians who were on the whole friendly , the Bella Coola River and the tribe it is named for . On July 18 he succeeded in getting some of them to embark with his party in one of their big canoes . ( " I had imagined that the Canadians who accompanied me were the most expert canoemen in the world , but they are very inferior to these people , as they themselves acknowledged , in conducting those vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , a frantic ant heap of curiosity about them , cluttered with fishing gear and rich in European goods . Mackenzie induced them to return to the river , they made thirtysix miles , lost his little dog ( which they would find , half-crazed , on their return ) , and passed a landmark which he was later able to identify as having been visited by Vancouver 's Mr. Johnstone six weeks earlier . Then on July 20 , sixty-eight days out from the winter post , " at about eight A.M. we got out of the river , which discharges itself by various channels into an arm of the sea . The tide was out and had left a large space covered with seaweed . " They went on , passing sea otter , till two in the afternoon , when big swells forced them to land . It was done . There is no knowing who first dreamed of crossing North America , but it was an old dream in 1534 when Cartier first heard of a big river that would be called the St. Lawrence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years earlier the amazed slave hunters had led Cabeza de Vaca into Culiacan . The fear of his men still held , and was intensified by the uneasiness of the Indians who had come with them . Now they  | met Indians who were aggressive and contemptuous . One of them had a grievance : lately there had been a ship and some white men in these waters and one of them , " Macubah , " had fired at him and another one , " Bensins , " had struck him with the flat of a sword . Though Mackenzie had no way of knowing it , he was talking about Vancouver and his naturalist Menzies . This was actually the most dangerous moment of the entire journey but Mackenzie insisted on seeing as much of the archipelago as he could , and he would not leave till he had made enough celestial observations to be sure of his figures . His Indians grew more afraid of the coastal tribe and his own men were " panic-struck . " On July 22 he had all he wanted , the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite checked by one of its first satellite . " I had now determined my situation . " No sail had appeared in Dean Channel and at last he turned back , against a powerfully ebbing tide . First , however , he mixed some vermilion with melted grease and painted an inscription " in large characters " on the face of a rock . It read : " Alexander Mackenzie , from Canada , by land , the twenty-second of July , one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three . " Mackenzie 's book was published in 1801 . No one read it more attentively than the new President of the United States , Thomas Jefferson , for it stated Mackenzie 's matured plan for transcontinental trade imperialism . The principal reason why he had written and published it , in fact , was to put pressure on the British government to act on his vision and secure this great commerce , the route it must use , and the territory it must cross before the American imperialism could secure them . But an attentive reader of the passage that described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger brother William . And when William Clark read it both he and its author , and Jefferson as well , believed that the big river which Mackenzie had left in order to make the land-carry , the Fraser River , was the one which , after his return , he learned that Captain Robert Gray had discovered and named the Columbia . The tensions of the 1790 's produced in Upper Louisiana , which was now the Spanish Province of Illinois , an effort to  | strengthen the frontier similar to the one that had been made in the preceding two decades in the Pacific Northwest . It had the same purpose , to protect Santa Fe as the outpost defense of the Mexican silver mines . As the passage ( written in 1793 ) already quoted from Carondelet shows , the officials knew that the Mississippi in itself could not stop the westering Americans . They had " the unmeasured ambition of a new people , who are vigorous , hostile to all subjection , and who have been uniting and multiplying . . . with a remarkable rapidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little cornmeal in a sack is sufficient for an American to range the forests for a month . " If they got to the Missouri , or even in force to the Mississippi , nothing could prevent them from going farther . New Mexico was too thinly populated to stop them , and indeed it provided a danger of its own which was abhorrent to Spanish thinking . The New Mexicans would " unite willingly and eagerly with men who , offering them their aid and protection to become independent , to govern themselves , and to impose their own taxes , will flatter them with the spirit of liberty and with a trade free , extensive , and lucrative . In my opinion a general revolution in America threatens Spain .... " The Spanish hold on the Province of Illinois was far from secure . The French who comprised almost all its population thought of themselves as but temporarily subjects of Spain and looked forward confidently to a day when French power would be restored . Though Genet was discredited and his General Clark did not get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West and corresponded with all the underground plots , however crackbrained . Some of them turned Jacobin and organized revolutionary clubs . In 1796 a French general who had toured much of Louisiana and the West on what was patently a military reconnaissance was turned back from the Missouri , arrested in New Orleans , and deprived of his notes and sketches . The British military threat subsided for a space but the Canadians forged steadily farther ahead in the trade war . Handicapped by the incurable lack of funds and by the creeping paralysis that had overtaken Spain 's administrative system , the officials at St. Louis went on making inadequate annual presents to many tribes . The Chouteaus and their associates maintained an active trade along the rivers that en-  | tered the Missouri from the south . The Osages , the diminished Missouris , the Kansas , the Wichitas , and the populous Pawnees remained Spanish . But the British dominated the trade of the upper Mississippi , they had reached the upper Missouri from Canada , and they had almost monopolized the trade in the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle and that fact requires a full statement . At the beginning of the 1780 's the North West Company , the Hudson 's Bay Company , and opposition firms traded with the tribes of the upper Missouri at posts on the Assiniboine River . Sometimes they established temporary posts on the Red River and the Souris , and some years before the end of the decade they had made brief visits to the upper Missouri itself , at the villages of the Mandans and the Minnetarees . By this time too competition out of Mackinac was beginning to visit the same region from the Des Moines River , crossing Iowa on the way . Wisconsin and Minnesota as far as the Mississippi were American territory ; the rest of Minnesota , Iowa , and Dakota were Spanish . The culture transformation of the western , migratory Sioux divisions was now complete ; they were Plains Indians . They had reached the central stretch of the Missouri River , were warring with the river tribes , and were beginning to raid farther west , in the direction of the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeyed to the Minnesota River and , presently , to the nearer Des Moines . South of the Sioux were the lowas . The British traded with them direct and it was through them that British goods reached other Missouri tribes . Those concerned were the Otos , the Omahas , the numerically small but troublesome Poncas , and the schizophrenic Arikaras . They were all displaced victims of the western surge of the Sioux and they all lived near the Missouri . The Spanish movement up the Missouri was intended to regain the loyalty and trade of these tribes , to clear Spanish territory of the British , to hold the river as a frontier defense of New Mexico ? and to discover a route to the Pacific . " All the maps printed both in England and the United States , and in France , are absolutely false , especially in regard to the course of the Misisipi and Misuri Rivers , " the governor wrote to the home office . Spanish ignorance of the far country was astonish-  | ing . Madrid had always governed the Indies compartmentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and this was late afternoon getting on toward evening ? the empire , sunk in poverty , apathy , cynicism , and graft , was dying . As late as 1787 the mouth of the Big Sioux River was the northern limit of empirical knowledge ; few traders had ever passed the Platte . Knowledge of the country north and west of there , except for some distance up the Kansas River , remained what it had been in the Illinois seventy years before , in de Bourgmond 's time . Such knowledge as had been acquired since then darkened counsel instead of enlightening it . For whereas the Northwesters were widening the map of North America , the Spanish had contracted it . The governor describes to the commandant of the Provincias Internas the lands that lie between Louisiana and the Californias . This is 1785.11 ... No one has ascended the Missouri beyond the mouth of the Big Sioux River . The Arkansas have told our traders that , at a distance of five hundred miles upstream from their villages , the Missouri comes down a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that begins a little to the east of Santa Fe and runs to Quivira . ( No one who had actually been to Quivira ? Kansas ? had reported mountains there . This conjecture joins the detached Wichita Mountains , which the Louisianans knew in Arkansas , to the Sangre de Cristo of New Mexico , seven hundred miles west of them . ) Rivers from the eastern slope of this range empty into the Arkansas and the Missouri , from their western slope into the Rio Grande . ( The Front Range of Colorado has been added to the mountain system ; exactly this configuration occurs in maps of the third quarter of the sixteenth century , two hundred years earlier . ) In this same New Mexican range the Platte , the Niobrara , and the Teton ( known only on hearsay ) also have their sources . Furthermore the Missouri rises somewhere in the same range and cuts through it . Its source is somewhere north of the Rio Grande headwaters ; it flows west , quarters northwest , and as it goes on swinging toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arikaras have described . West of the mountain range , at its southern end , is the country called Teguayo . ( Coronado 's Thayguayo of 1540 , now generally shown on the Pacific coast near the country of Anian . There is no awareness of anything that has  | happened in the Spanish Far West in two and a half centuries . ) But west of Teguayo this range is coastal , and therefore though it is cut across by the Missouri in one place , the river must rise in some other part , " because to the west of these mountains the sea or the Bay of the West almost washes its base . " ( Ten years later Carondelet widened this strip west of the mountains , which resembles what the Bow People had told the Verendrye brothers in 1742 , to forty leagues , a hundred miles . ) The indications here accepted as certain make it a small country . The Spanish in New Orleans do not know what those in New Mexico had learned about the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is no conception corresponding to the actual Rocky Mountain system . Such as it is , this chain of north-south mountains is traversed by the Missouri about five hundred miles upstream from the Arikara villages . They were at , approximately , Pierre , South Dakota ; five hundred miles farther would be Williston , North Dakota . That is why the Spanish officials were afraid that the British would invade New Mexico by boat or by an overland march . It is also why when they sent men out in the spring to go up the Missouri to the Pacific , they expected them to be back before winter closed in . Since they could not have more positively believed in the distances and dangers , some real distances may be stated . From the Arikara villages near Pierre the airline distance to Santa Fe is upward of 700 miles , from Lake Winnipeg to Santa Fe 1100 miles , from Hudson Bay to Santa Fe 1 500 miles . A route feasible for military invasion would be several hundred miles longer than any of these . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of actual rivers , it seems first to have conceived the movement as coming down the Missouri to the Platte , ascending the Platte to a convenient distance from Santa Fe , and then moving on the town direct . Such a movement would have had to be based on Lake Winnipeg or the Assiniboine River . The invaders would have had to travel from fifteen hundred to nineteen hundred miles , depending on whether they rowed the pirogues across the plains and desert or over the mountains . In 1787 a St. Louis fur merchant sent a young man named Joseph Garreau on a trading venture up the Missouri . How big a party he took or how far he got is not known . If the  | Arikaras were in their villages when he found them , then he was farther upriver than anyone before him had ascended it . He offended the Arikaras by violence and dishonesty and stored up trouble for the future . In 1792 a trader of long experience , Jacques D'Eglise , at last went all the way , closed the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , he took his pirogues to the Mandan villages ? Stanton , North Dakota , sixty miles above Bismarck ? and found them well supplied with British goods from the posts farther north.12 A Frenchman named Menard was living with the Mandans and said that he had been for fourteen years . A mysterious , substanceless figure in the literature of the upper river for the next decade , Menard has no explanation but he was obviously of the type who preferred savagery to civilized life and adopted it . He seems to have got goods from the British posts on the Assiniboine and Souris and to have traded them at the villages ; he must have been , irregularly , a contact man for the British companies . David Thompson , who saw him five years after D'Eglise , describes his fair-skinned Mandan woman and says " he was an intelligent man but completely a Frenchman , brave , gay , and boastful ; with his gun in one hand and his spear in the other , he stood erect and recounted to the Indians about us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coups and eventually died of it ; now he was boasting about his antiquity and lying about it , for he certainly had not been with the Mandans since 1778.13 D'Eglise was back in St. Louis in October 1792 . On October 6 some unnamed traders returned from the Kansas Indians , along the Kansas River , bringing with them three Spanish subjects whom their customers had been holding prisoner , a naturalized Frenchman named Vial and two New Mexicans . They had been sent out by the governor of New Mexico to establish communication with St. Louis and by virtue of the Kansas ' forbearance in merely capturing them had now done so , fifty-three years after the pioneering expedition of the Mallet brothers in the other direction . ( Since then Frenchmen from New Orleans had occasionally reached Santa Fe by more southerly routes ; there is evidence that others had tried to get there from the Missouri and perhaps succeeded , but without accomplishing anything . ) Vial 's march-diary is brief and very vague but he followed , roughly , the route that was to be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to have completed the 1541 journey of Coronado , who when he turned back from Quivira had learned that ahead of him were the Mississippi and the Missouri . Vial had lived in New Mexico for a long time and was an experienced frontiersman , but that the governor had sent so small a party may indicate that distance had shrunk in Santa Fe thinking too since the time of Villasur . Vial confirmed the shrinkage and so confirmed the misconceptions held in St. Louis . He said that if the Kansas had not captured him he could have made the trip handily in twenty-five days . He could not have done it in fifty days , but to the officials in St. Louis here was further evidence that Santa Fe was wide open to British troop movements from Hudson Bay.14 Then D'Eglise came back with news that the British were on the upper river . Everything he had to report to the authorities was momentous . The Mandans were rich in furs , he said , and therefore they presented a great commercial opportunity . ( He added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been tolerably swarthy . ) Furthermore , since they had Mexican saddles , bridles , and other goods , they must trade directly with New Mexico or with tribes that did . The conclusion was as obvious to St. Louis as it had been to the French on the Assiniboine River in Verendrye 's time : here was still another kind of evidence that New Mexico was close to the Missouri . And in this , the first eyewitness account of the upper Missouri that St. Louis had ever had , he made an exceedingly important declaration , one which St. Louis was to hold to and which was to govern its thinking from now on . The lieutenant governor ( who complains that D'Eglise is ignorant and illiterate ) reports it : " The Missouri flows always from a western  | and northwestern direction , with sufficient water for navigation by any of the larger boats of these the locally known rivers . " By now the locally known rivers were being navigated not only by large pirogues but by still larger keelboats . In 1792 , the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mackenzie 's transcontinental crossing , one of the most valuable servants the Hudson 's Bay Company ever had , Peter Fidler , set out from its westernmost post , Buckingham House , which had been built in 1791 on the south branch of the Saskatchewan River . He crossed Alberta to the Rocky Mountains somewhere near the head of the Little Bow River , southwest of Calgary . The first white man who had ever penetrated that region , he traveled extensively , though he can not be followed with as much accuracy as would be desirable , and spent the winter with the Piegans , one of the Blackfoot tribes . Next year , returning to Cumberland House , he used a different route . For a long time it was supposed that his journey south along the foot of the Rockies had taken him below 49 ? , into lands that are now American , and this idea still persists as a legend . He appears , however , to have gone no farther south than about a hundred miles north of the Montana border . The reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had miscalculated some of his latitudes and distances . Though the Hudson 's Bay usually kept its knowledge securely locked up , it was at this time performing a valuable public service by turning over some of what it learned to the London mapmaker Aaron Arrowsmith . Fidler 's data were given to Arrowsmith , as the more important ones of David Thompson 's surveys were presently to be . In 1795 Arrowsmith published the first edition of his great and influential map of North America . Fidler 's erroneous latitudes appeared on it . In the event they were to exercise a strong influence on the thinking of Thomas Jefferson and the actions of his explorers.15 The report of D'Eglise , misconceiving or embroidering parts of what he had seen , called for action and produced it . Mean-  | while in 1793 lie started up the river again with two pirogues of goods , accompanied by Garreau . Somewhere below the Teton River he ran head-on into a fact more important than any lie had discovered last year : either the Sioux or the Arikaras , refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 They had closed it to the Spanish as effectively as the Spanish ever closed the Mississippi to the Americans and the blockade was to last longer . D'Eglise , who covered his backers ' investment during the winter trade but made no profit , blamed the disaster on Garreau . He had a " turbulent and libertine spirit " and used his employers ' goods " for indecent purposes other than those for which they had been designed . " That Garreau was an offensive and unruly man had already been established and he forthwith added to his reputation . D'Eglise 's accusation is probably true but Garreau was not the cause of the blockade . As the next few years were to show , this was a contention among the tribes for their neighbors ' trade . Neither the Arikaras nor the Sioux wanted their enemies to get guns and powder unless they themselves could control the supply . If there were to be St. Louis goods on the upper river they wanted them in quantity for themselves , and they wanted for themselves the profit to be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge was a preference for the better and cheaper British goods that were coming from the Mississippi . And if it was the Sioux who said no , there was also their strong pro-British partisanship . Tribes not so far upriver had the same idea . As a result of D'Eglise 's report the Commercial Company for the Discovery of the Nations of the Upper Missouri had been formed in St. Louis . It is usually called the Missouri Company . An association of St. Louis merchants , it did not include the Chouteaus or their associates and that was one reason for its failure . They were doing well enough on the lower river , they had no taste for distant risks , and they were hostile to competition . The Company was subsidized by the government , though far from enough , and was granted a monopoly of the Missouri trade above the Poncas . The government offered a prize to the first Spaniard who should go all the way and reach the Russian settlements on the Pacific coast . For " Spaniard " read " Spanish subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa was French or Canadian English . The discoverer of the Pacific route would travel , naturally , through the notch  | that the river cut in the Rocky Mountains , and if anyone had consulted a map that showed the latitude of the Aleutians he had made nothing of it . In 1794 the Missouri Company sent out its first expedition , under Jean Baptiste Truteau.17 He was the first schoolmaster of St. Louis but had had much experience as a trader on the Des Moines River and elsewhere . In the same year D'Eglise went up the river again and was again stopped by the Arikaras . He returned to St. Louis with the news that his earlier trips had stimulated the British to build a small post between the Mandan and Minnetaree villages , and took with him two French engages who had fled from the British companies . ' $ Other traders were on the middle river the same year , Munier at the Poncas where he had first gone in 1789 and one Solomon Petit in the same vicinity . The attempt was too weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods were sparse and of poor quality . He took two pirogues up the unpredictable , ever shifting river , with its innumerable " crossings " of the channel from bank to bank , sandbars and the islands and matted embarras , snags and sawyers and planters , stretches where the boats had to be cordelled by hand , and long periods of degrade when high winds forbade travel . By luck or stealth he got past the Omahas and Poncas , whom the directors had expected to rob him . At the end of September 1794 , sixteen weeks out of St. Louis , he was approaching the Grand Detour where the river twice doubles on its course round narrow points of land . He expected to meet his first customers , the Arikaras , just beyond it . But as he reached the lower end a party of Sioux stopped him . Three lodges of them were Yanktons , at this period comparatively amiable folk , but mainly they were Tetons , who were the quintessential Sioux . They threw the party into just such a panic as Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them than he ever managed to do with any other Indians . Recognizing Yankton chiefs he had known on the Des Moines , he demanded sanctuary and got it , thus preventing complete pillage and probably massacre as well . When he proclaimed the authority of Spain , they told him that they had no Spanish father . The British alliance held in Louisiana ? the Sioux were a resistance movement . They got him to admit that he intended to trade with the Arikaras . ( One of
