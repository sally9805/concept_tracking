When a child in an apparently normal family of good reputation develops such habits as setting fires , stealing , truancy , vandalism or sexual misconduct , the chances are that he was stimulated by his parents ' unconscious approval . This is the conclusion set forth in the A.M. A. Jour nal by two psychiatrists , the Mayo Clinic 's Dr. Adelaide M. Johnson and the University of California 's Dr. Stanislaus A. Szurek , after a ten-year study . Their explanation : in such cases the parents have not been able to resolve their own antisocial impulses , so they can not deal firmly with their children 's . In fact , they get vicarious satisfaction from them . The result is tacit approval and implied encouragement of the budding delinquent . <P> On the surface , delinquency in " good " families ( where slum conditions and juvenile gangs are not a factor ) seems hard to explain . But where the two psychiatrists were able to study both child and parents , they reported , the child 's " defect " was always traceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conscience is made , not born , " and during his first six years of life , his conscience is molded chiefly by the parents . A defective conscience in the child is often allowed to develop " so that the parents unconsciously can achieve pleasure by permitting the child to misbehave seriously . " And a child is only too quick to sense parental pleasure . <P> Such sanctioning ranges from encouraging a child to lie about his age , so as to enter a movie at cut rates , to more profound forms of implied approval , e.g. , " inordinate maternal curiosity regarding daughter 's experiences with boys . . . misguided , too exciting discussions about sex . . . encouragement of display of undue degrees of nudity at home . " In many " respectable " families , an attitude of " frankness " about procreation " is carried far beyond the needs of the curious child . . . and much of this spuriousness is perpetrated in the name of Freud , who advocated moderation and restraint ; the parent was to answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurid oration . . . He never encouraged exhibitionistic displays of nudity . " <P> Treatment for the parent in cases where his bad influence is more or less conscious is usually impossible , say Psychiatrists Johnson and Szurek . Where the influence is unconscious , the parent can be helped to understand what he has been doing . This may lead to parental shock and neurosis , but , say the researchers , such conditions can be treated more easily than antisocial behavior , which can be transmitted from generation to generation .
