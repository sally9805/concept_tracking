Industrial Chaplains <P> In Lone Star , Texas this week , the Lone Star Steel Co. will open a new $40,000 building where the company will make no steel , transact no business . The building is a chapel . There , a fulltime , specially trained Methodist chaplain will spend his time primarily offering aid and counsel to troubled workers . Similar pastor-counselor or devotional programs are fast spreading to dozens of other U.S. corporations . Next week in Cleveland , a prime topic at the National Council of Churches meeting will be the new industrial chaplain . The Northern California Council has already drafted a program to spread the gospel of industrial chaplains as its " No. 1 objective for 1956 . " <P> The strongest argument in favor of industrial chaplains is made in the plants where they are already at work . North Carolina 's Fieldcrest Mills started its program six years ago , and neither management nor workers has regretted the move . At Fieldcrest , the Rev. James K. McConnell visits sick workers , keeps in contact with retired employees , tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need help to solve their troubles . All counseling is strictly secret , strictly voluntary . Chaplain McConnell , a Southern Baptist , has an average of three counseling talks a day with Fieldcrest workers on problems ranging from alcoholism to unruly children . In the same manner , neighboring Reynolds Tobacco has been running a successful chaplain program since 1949 and thinks that it makes important business sense : absenteeism is down , production up , plant morale higher than before . <P> Le Tourneau , Inc. maintains full-time chaplains at both its Vicksburg , Miss , and Longview , Tex . plants for on-the-job spiritual guidance ; the chaplains also hold weekly services which 85% of the workers attend . Tulsa 's Sunray-Mid Continent Oil Co. has employed a chaplain since 1947 , and his advice is so heavily in demand that he will soon get a second assistant . The story is the same at San Diego 's Solar Aircraft , Dallas ' John E. Mitchell Co. , Dearborn Stove Co. , Ohio 's Pioneer Rubber Co . At Solar Aircraft , the program was so well liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build the Rev. Tipton L. Wood a chapel . <P> Despite the obvious successes , however , a good many critics challenge the idea . Some businessmen feel that chaplains are useful only in small , centralized plants , or question the whole idea of mixing business and religion . Many thoughtful churchmen also have reservations . They fear that too much time can be devoted to public relations , morale and production-boosting projects having little to do with religion ; others worry that industrial chaplains steal away parishioners from established local pastors . But by far the biggest complaint comes from union leaders , who fear that management will use religion as a weapon against labor and to talk down justified complaints and demands . Said the Protestant Christian Century : " The first danger in a company-paid chaplaincy is that the chaplain may become a company-paid errand boy for bolstering company policy , pacifying complaints , playing on religious predilections to keep workers happy . The church should not condone such prostitution of its ministry . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
