The weekly National Guardian ( circ. 47,000 ) , though it follows the Communist Party line almost as faithfully as the Communist Daily Worker , claims to be a " progressive weekly affiliated with no political party . " Started in 1948 , the Guardian parrots the Communist charges of germ warfare in Korea , consistently berates U.S. " imperialist " expansion , runs special dispatches from Communist correspondents in North Korea , and has even printed a list of prisoners of war in Korea ( TIME , May 21 , 1951 ) that was available only to the world Communist press . <P> Fortnight ago , Guardian Editor Cedric Belfrage , 48 , a British subject who has lived in the U.S. for most of the last 16 years , was summoned before Congressman Velde 's Un-American Activities Committee . The committee wanted to know about a job Belfrage had held after World War II , working in Germany for the British under U.S. military authorities as press control officer , licensing new German newspapers . Had Belfrage. asked the committee , given out licenses to Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belfrage refused to say anything about his job in Germany . <P> When the committee asked him about a charge in a book by former Communist Spy Elizabeth Bentley that Belfrage had been a spy himself in 1943 , Belfrage again refused to answer . As soon as Republican Congressman Bernard W. Kearney heard his testimony , he demanded that the Immigration Department , which had already begun looking into Belfrage 's record , take steps to deport him . <P> Last week Editor Belfrage appeared before Joe McCarthy 's Senate Investigating Subcommittee along with the Guardian 's executive editor , Allen James Aronson . This time the committee asked Belfrage directly whether 1 ) he was or had ever been a Communist , and 2 ) he had engaged in espionage against the U.S. <P> Once again Belfrage refused to answer , pleading the charge of selfincrimination . <P> Executive Editor Aronson , who had also worked in Germany licensing news papers with Belfrage , was only slightly more talkative : he admitted that some Communists did get licenses to start pa pers with the aid of U.S. Government cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he flatly refused to discuss his present job or to say whether he was ever a Communist . <P> At week 's end the Immigration authori ties swung into action . They picked up Belfrage , charged that he was an alien engaged in Communist activity in the U.S. , and took him to Ellis Island to await deportation under the McCarran Act .
