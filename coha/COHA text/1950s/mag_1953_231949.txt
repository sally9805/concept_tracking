Until his 40th birthday , Roy Herbert Thomson never owned a newspaper or hoped to . But once started , Thomson made up for lost time as few publishers have . After he bought a tiny paper in Northern Canada ( with $3,000 he borrowed ) , the newspaper business looked so easy to Thomson that he confidently told a friend : " I 'll be a millionaire some day . " It was an accurate prediction . At 59 , Publisher Thomson owns a string of 18 dailies all over Canada , close to one-fourth of Canada 's English-language newspapers . Last year he pushed into the U.S. by buying the St. Petersburg ( Fla . ) Independent ( circ. 25,754 ) , and this year he reached across the Atlantic to start the Canada Review , a weekly for Canadians in Britain and Britons with business interests in Canada . <P> Last week Canadian-born Thomson crossed the ocean again for the biggest newspaper deal of his brief but spectacular career . For about $3,000,000 , he bought control of Scotland 's small but influential 136-year-old morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Edinburgh Evening Dispatch ( 71,000 ) and the Weekly Scotsman ( 66,000 ) . In taking control of the papers from old Scottish family ownership , Thomson gets a staff of 800 , a 13-story Renaissance-style building that cost $2,400,000 in 1904 , and the prestige of a pioneer publishing company . On the Scotsman 's hundredth birthday the London Times conceded that the paper " is , so to speak , the Times of Scotland . " <P> The Chain Store . No newsman himself , Thomson concentrates his energies on the business side , lets individual editors run their own show up to a point . The point : the paper 's profit &; loss statement . But Thomson 's mechanical improvements have made it easier for editors to show profits . In Canada , he has connected most of his papers with a teletype circuit . Thus , when one has a successful feature or circulation-building idea , other papers in the chain can promptly pick it up . At first his chain-store methods set conservative Canadian publishers against him . But they changed their minds when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a better newspaper as well as a better investment for him . Three years ago he was elected president of the Canadian Daily Newspapers Association . <P> Thomson , the son of a Toronto barber , learned how to read a balance sheet the hard way . He quit school in Toronto at 14 , began to clerk in a fishing supply store , starting at $5 a week . Within ten years he had invested his small savings so shrewdly that he had $20,000 , which he lost in a pie-in-the-sky Saskatchewan land deal . During the Depression he sold radios in northern Ontario , quickly found that in some remote Canadian towns reception was so poor that few people would buy his sets . Thomson knew how to solve that . For $500 , he bought his own transmitter , started broadcasting recorded programs from North Bay , Ont. ( pop . 15,599 ) . When he moved 230 miles north to Timmins ( pop . 28,790 ) to start another station in 1934 , he ended up with a weekly newspaper too , within three years had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers .
