txt Mayor Wagner signed yesterday the local law imposing a 5 per cent amusement tax . The new levy will become effective July 1 and is expected to yield $16,700,000 in 1954-55 . The tax will be administered under regulations now being drafted by Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa . The 5 per cent levy will apply to admissions to places of amusement and the use of facilities in such places . It will also apply to membership and initiation fees of sport and social clubs . Boxing and wrestling matches and horse racing are exempt from the tax because they now pay taxes to the state . The tax will not apply to admissions or charges not exceeding 10 cents , nor will it apply to admissions to amuse // ments or performances in cases where the proceeds are for charitable-purposes . The Mayor also signed a companion law exempting night clubs and cabarets from the city 's 3 per cent sales tax . The exemption was granted because night clubs and cabarets are still paying the 20 per cent Federal excise tax while other amusement activities subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Federal tax reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent , as of April 1 . In a statement issued after he signed the law the Mayor declared that Governor Dewey 's rejection of the city 's own fiscal program left him no alternative except emasculation of the 1954-55 budget by cutting salaries or eliminating vital services . The Mayor signed the law soon after closing a five-hour public hearing at which the proposed tax was assailed by various segments of the amusement industry , with the motion picture houses leading the assault . Bitter Clashes Mark Hearing The hearing took on at times the aspect of the Army-McCarthy hearings in Washington . It was marked by bitter clashes between Budget Director Abraham D. Beame and spokesmen for the motion picture industry over the accuracy of estimates of the tax yield . There were cries of " let me finish " ; one speaker raised " a point of personal privilege " and the Mayor on two occasions was forced to pound his gavel to restore order . The only thing missing was a demand for monitored telephone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield of $5 , - 500,000 from motion picture admissions , as against the industry 's estimate of only $3,500,000 . He stood by his estimate of $16 , - 700,000 for all areas covered by the tax , as against the $8,800,000 estimate made by opponents of the levy . A representative of Governor Dewey 's special commission on reorganization of state finances took copious notes as Mr. Beanie and the motion picture groups slugged it out . The commission , headed by Frederick L. Bird of Dun &; Bradstreet , was asked recently by Mr. Dewey to look into the fiscal aspects of the amusement tax , including its probable annual yield , and to submit a report that might be the basis for the Legislature 's repeal of the city 's power to impose the levy . In his statement blaming Mr. Dewey and the Legislature , the Mayor declared that his original fiscal program , " callously and hastily rejected " by Mr. Dewey , would have made the amusement levy unnecessary . He accused Mr. Dewey of " fiscal containment " of the city ; issuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's efforts to raise funds to balance its $1,639,438 , - 325 budget for 1954-55 . This policy of containment , the Mayor charged , was carried into the recent special session , which ignored the city 's final request for fiscal aid . Mr. Dewey 's reference of the amusement tax to the Bird Commission for study was ridiculed by the Mayor , who found it " odd " that the surveying agency should be a group appointed by Mr. Dewey and listing among its members the State Controller , State Budget Director and the chairman of the State Tax Commission . " These gentlemen , " the Mayor said , " have , I fear , long since prejudged the issues they are now asked to study . " The Governor 's reference of the problem to the Bird Commission is another indication of the State Administration 's policy to inject itself into local affairs only in the familiar role of an obstruc-1 tionist political critic . " At this time there is left only the alternate of approving the bill or emasculating the budget by reducing salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good conscience choose any other course but to approve it . " The possibility of Congressional retaliation for the city 's 5 per cent amusement levy after the Federal tax had been cut from 20 per cent to 10 per cent , was raised by Representative Emanuel Celler , Brooklyn Democrat . He told the Mayor that some members of Congress would regard a 5 per cent tax by the city as " flouting the will of Congress . " The result , he intimated , might be a corresponding cut in Federal aid to the city . Mr. Celler told reporters that he appeared at the hearing as an individual , although admitting that the law firm of which he is a member , represented the Indendent Theatre Owners Association , one of the leaders of the fight against the amusement tax . Among those who opposed the tax were spokesmen for motion picture and legitimate theatres , outdoor amusement resorts , bowling alleys and private luncheon clubs . Opposition was also expressed by a representative of the New York Yankees , New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgem . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hearings before the City Council and the Board of Estimate , on the argument that it would force the closing of many theatres , resulting in widespread unemployment and serious damage to retail business in many local neighborhoods.
