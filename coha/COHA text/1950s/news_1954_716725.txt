txt The congressional report on Federal Housing Administration scandals would have come with more force had remedial action not already been taken , in the meantime , in the new housing law . This law was being written almost simultaneously with the committee hearings , and the disclosures of that time strongly influenced - the- framing - of that legislation and elimination of loopholes contained in previous measures . The long-awaited report of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee is sharply critical of past administration of the FHA ; takes the building industry to task for an " ostrich-like attitude " during the whole episode , and takes occasion to reprimand seven attorneys appearing before the committee for conduct unbecoming to their profession . Congress absolves itself from blame in the report , claiming it was maladministration of the law , rather than any defect in the law itself ? which ? was , . re ? - sponsible for the " unconscionable windfall profits " and the fleecing of homeowners under the home-repair program . Senator Critical Senator Homer E. Capehart ( R ) of Indiana , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing record over the past 20 years ... the biggest scandal in the history of our government . " The " most amazing fact " about the program , in his opinion , was the hiring and retention of a man with a " long previous police record " to head the agency . He referred to Clyde L. Powell , who has since been convicted of contempt for refusing to give information to a grand jury regarding the . FHA scandals , and has been sentenced to a year in jail . These . scandals revolved aa'ound two specific provisions in the previous law , one providing for government-insured loans in the building of rental housing , and the second concerning special loans for home repairs . The now notorious " windfall profits " evolved from the first , and a home-repair racket under which homeowners were charged several times the actual value of the work . The report charges the FHA with laxness in permitting these " .. - auds " to continue , maintain ing that it could have prevented them had it been more alert to false applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . Moreover , it claimed that the FHA actually prevented the Federal Bureau of Investigation from taking up the investigation . Democratic View While the Deraocratie , s.zninorr , ity on the committee did not challenge the release of the report , it felt the document was much too sweeping in its accufzations . Democrats felt it did " not make it sufficiently clear that only a relatively few in the industry and in the FHA were guilty of malfeasance , obstruction , or deliberate misrepresentation . " As a result of its long investigation into the program , during which the committee held hearings in many cities throughout the country , it discovered that out of 543 projects investigated , some 437 involved " windfall profits . " These profits ensued when the money borrowed , on the basis of government - insured loans , actually exceeded the final cost , with builders pocketing the difference . The loan must be paid eventually , of course , but it is actually the tenant who must pay it , through rents based on the original higher cost estimate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgages , " was the way the committee put it . Prosecution Barred It was figured that this excess may total $6,500,000 over the next 30 years . Most of this " windfall " . profittaking occurred in the years 1950 and 1951 , the committee discovered , and not during the 1946-48 housing shortage . The most frustrating aspect of all , however , is the fact that nothing can be done now to prosecute in ' these cases , for the rental housing program expired in 1950 and the statute of limitations bars further action . With reference to the home-building industry , the committee took it to task for having failed to apprise Congress of the existence of wrongdoing . Going further , it deplored the " few greedy and sometimes dishonest builders " who had taken advantage of the government 's housing program . Seven attorneys appearing before the committee during the hearings were criticized for conduct which had not been " conducive to that standard of truth and justice which lawyers have , and must advocate .
