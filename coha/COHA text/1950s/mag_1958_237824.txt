" We 've been on so many retreats lately , " said a Glenview , Ill. housewife last week , " that I 'm beginning to feel like retreating myself . " The kind of retreat she was talking about-a program full of organized " activities " - would not have been recognizable to most U.S. Christians of a generation ago . But her Glenview Community Church , and the faith it fosters , is symptomatic of a kind of Protestantism that is burgeoning in the suburban nondenominational churches all over the U.S. The International Council of Community Churches now has 217 members , estimates that there are at least more than 1,500 other community churches in the U.S.-many of them , like Glenview , dedicated to the new-time religion . <P> Glenview Community Church has no simple pastor with assistants but a " team ministry " of four clergymen , all equal in authority . Their church is a believe-as-you-like , worship-as-you-please fellowship of searchers , and the ministers ' language often sounds less religious than sociological . Christians should develop a " relationship with God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye must be kept on " fringe individuals " ; the church is " **27;16525;TOOLONG " and its beliefs are " anchored but open-ended . " <P> The open end is filled with dozens of beaver-busy organizations in a daily boil of dances , pageants , picnics-holding " buzz sessions , " helping out with " sicking " ( i.e. , sick calls ) and organizing " casserole brigades . " There are hunting and fishing groups , a men 's discussion group named The Carpenters ( " they try to face real realities " ) , a Woman 's Association , a boys ' hot-rod group , " family festivals , " camps for all ages , a radio program , a chatty church newspaper , ten choirs ( " SING ! SING ! SING ! " says a recruiting pamphlet ) . In a recent sermon , one minister ruefully quoted a newcomer as saying to another : " I guess I 'll have to join that damned church to get acquainted . " <P> Real Fellowship . Glenview Community Church is 17 years old , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only 50 members in a community of 2,000 people . Today the community has mushroomed to 16,000 , and the church estimates its adult membership at 2,000 , with an additional 1,500 who have not yet joined but take part in church activities . Some 2,200 youngsters engage the full-time efforts of two of the four **28;16554;TOOLONG Clinton Ritchie , who handles the teenagers , and Baptist-ordained Theophilus Ringsmuth. who concentrates on the youngsters below the seventh grade , also has " primary responsibility " for the families of his moppets.
