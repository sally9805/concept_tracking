 | How We Dropped the A-Bomb @# IN THE middle of the morning of Aug. 4 , 1945 , I walked into the office of Col. Paul W. Tibbets at headquarters on Tinian Island in the Marianas . Capt . Chuck Sweeney and a couple of other B-29 pilots were already there . So were Capt . William S. Parsons , a Navy technical expert , and a handful of scientists . I knew then that they were going to let us in on the secret . I could tell by their faces that it was going to be big , but I had no idea that I was going to be asked to help fly the plane that would open the Age of Atomic War . This was a preliminary briefing for the pilots ? in case something happened to Tibbets ? and it did n't take long to fill us in . Col. Tibbets , CO of the 509th Group , showed us some films of the first A-bomb explosion at Alamogordo , New Mexico , which had taken place less than three weeks earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explosion of 20,000 tons of TNT . " The brass thinks this one bomb will shorten the war by six months , " he said . As I look back on it now , I remember that he did not use the word " atomic . " After 11 months of total blackout , the Security Branch was letting us in on only part of the secret . We were n't to hear the magic words " atomic energy " until after we had dropped the bomb . " Silence " had been the key word since we first organized the 509th Composite Group at Wendover Field , Utah , in September , 1944 . The day we arrived , Tibbets had mounted a sound truck and told us that we were an extra-special unit in many ways . He said , first , that we would be completely self-sustaining , that we would have our own engineering , troop carrier , and ordnance groups ? even our own control tower . He ended by saying , " You will not talk about this project A flight ends and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves . If pinned down , say that you 're in a heavy bombardment at Wendover and that you 're flying B-29s . No more . ' He paused . " Anyone who does not want to stay those conditions can get a transfer right now . " Some of the guys took him up on it . The whole proj an unreal air about it that made us uneasy . Mission accomplished , the Boeing B-29 Slperfortress Enola Gay returns to Tinian , Mariana Islands But now the strain of holding it in ? and waiting ? was most over . Tibbets said : " We 're scheduled to take off 0245 hours the day after tomorrow . " The next morning , Aug. 5 , I eased the Enola Gay ging off her hardstand and swung onto the taxi strip . This was be her final test flight , and I was jittery . Four B-29s f other groups on Tinian had crashed and burned that ? on the runway .

Parsons pointed that a crash on takeoff with a live atomic bomb aboard co conceivably kill several thousand pilots and crewmen blow up several hundred B-29s . Farrell said , " Well , maybe you could put the thing gether after takeoff . You know how ? " Parsons answered , " No , sir , I do n't ? but I 've got all aft noon to learn . " He was in the air-conditioned Quonset hut with a gro of scientists , writing out cryptic instructions to himself , wh I took off .

" Midnight , Aug. 5 Two hours and 45 minutes to go now before takeoff time . r om church , we filed quietly through the tropical darkness : o the briefing room . There was no chatter . The steaming room was dead quiet when Tibbets stood up . " Everything is moving according to plan , " he said , " except for one thing . There are B-29s returning to Tinian at the middle and upper altitudes . We 'll have to fly our first leg at an altitude of 4,000 feet instead of 9,000 . " I did n't like that . At that altitude , we were sure to run into cumulus ? puffy , bumpy clouds . They 'd throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooking up the wires on the Gimmick. 1 a.m. , Aug. 6 Chow . And it was good . Real eggs , not powdered . No one said much . We knew now that Tibbets would take over my plane as Aircraft Commander , and that I would fly as pilot in the right seat . Capt . Chuck Sweeney would be flying The Great Artiste . He would come in over the target about four miles behind us and drop recording equipment to gauge the intensity of the blast . These readings , telemetered by radio to Sweeney 's plane , would be given to the scientists at Tinian . And Maj. George Marquardt , in the unnamed No. 44-191 , would lay back about 40 miles and fly in behind us taking pictures . The three of us would rendezvous first over Iwo Jima. 2:15 a.m . The flight line was blazing with light . Spotlights drenched the Enola Gay . A hundred cameramen swarmed around her and around us . They did n't know yet what our special mission was , but they had been told by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . " As we broke away and moved toward the plane , cameramen and reporters pulled us aside and asked us to wear @#  | their watches , their rings anything ? so they could have keepsake that went on " The Big Mission . " 2:27 a.m . We started the engines . Tibbets went down the check list slowly and carefully . Then we taxied her off the ha stand out of the bath of newsreel lights and into the Tinian darkness . " Dimples One-Two to North Tinian Tower , " said Tibbets " Request taxi and off instructions . " " North Tinian TowerDimples One-Two ; Take off east on R. way A. Good luck . " 2:45 a.m . Exactly on sched we eased the brat : and poured on coal . Tibbets held down for the full t miles of the runway , so long , in fact , that spoke to him quietly " Come on , Paul . Let ' go . We were 16,000 lbs .. over max gross , and she came off sluggishly . As we broke ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for another full minute to build up speed , and I began milking the flaps . At 200 feet , we swung to the left to our heading of 338 degrees . Iwo Jima was 622 miles away . 2:50 a.m . " Colonel Tibbets from Captain Parsons . " " Yes , Captain . " " If it 's all right with you , sir , I 'll begin . " " Oka " Y ? I looked back through the half-gloom of the B-29 's fuselage and saw Capt . Parsons absent-mindedly knock the bowl of his cold pipe against his heel . He took a last look at the indicator lights on the bomb-control panel by his station . then slid his long frame down into the bomb bay . Lt. Morri , , Jepson , Parsons ' assistant , disappeared behind him . I looked over at Tibbets , but he was staring straight ahead . 3:13 a.m . Something went wrong with the intercom . With the switch on " Inter , " we were getting both intercom and outside VHF radio transmissions . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibbets ordered us to cut all intercom chatter , but he maintained radio contact with Gen. Farrell back on Tinian as long as he could . They had a code in which each word stood for a sentence . Farrell asked , " How is Parsons doing ? " " He has n't come up yet . " We droned on , logging 215 m.p.h. , dodging the towering cumulus as well as we could , trying to make it easy for Parsons . He and Jepson were crammed into a small space be-@#  | hind the bomb . The light was bad . And we knew his toughest job was hooking up dozens of wires in correct sequence , for most of the firing system was electrical . Actually , an atomic bomb is a fairly simple thing . As Dr. Robert Williams , one of the earliest atomic scientists , said , " You merely take several pieces of fissionable material that are as pure as possible and unite them as quickly as possible . " But uniting the materials is tough . You bring together two portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount . " If you have less than the critical amount , nothing happens . If you have more , you get a chain reaction so rapid that the material explodes . During the reaction , which takes about 1/10,000,000 of a second , neutrons fly off . If enough escape , the reaction runs down and there is no explosion . To contain the escaping neutrons , you surround the U-235 with a high-density material , such as gold . This reflects the neutrons back into the mass and keeps the reaction going . 3:20 a.m . Slowly and painfully , Capt . Parsons hauled himself up out of the bomb bay . He said nothing , merely nodded , but we knew the A-bomb was armed . At the same time , we lost radio contact with Ed Dahl , a civilian scientist back on Tinian . There would be no further help for us now if we got into any kind of trouble . 3:32 a.m . We still did n't know what was the matter with the radio . I could hear our navigator , Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Sgt. Joe Stiborik , checking each other 's estimate of the wind . Sgt. Bob Shumard and Sgt. Wyatt Duzenbury were paralleling the generators. 4:20 a.m . Dutch sent me up an estimated time of arrival at Iwo at 0552 , and Tibbets , exhausted after 24 hours without sleep , slipped aft to curl up for a catnap . I checked " George , " the autopilot , once again , and settled down warily in my seat . 4:45 a.m . Still at 4,700 feet , still dodging cumulus . Then the moon rose . Somehow it was reassuring to see at least a spot of light in the heavy darkness . After a short try at a nap , Tibbets came back . I crawled aft to get some pineapple juice and a roast-beef sandwich . On the way forward again , I stopped beside Parsons ' station . He was reading his instructions again . The lights on his control panel were glowing a steady , unwinking green . " What the hell do all these green lights mean ? " I asked . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " if all those lights are green , we 're in good shape . If some of them go off and the red ones come on , that 's not so good . " And I knew he would n't tell me more . " Is it fully armed ? " I asked . " I guess it would go off , " he said , " but before we drop  | I 've got to make two more quick changes in the wiring . " 4:59 a.m . Heading , 340 degrees . Indicated air peed , 217 m.p.h . The sun climbed into the sky on our right . It was the last dawn for Hiroshima . We started our climb for the rendezvous t Iwo . We would slip into our lonely ree-plane formation at 9,000 feet . 5:55 a.m . Three minutes behind schedule we icked up the Great Artiste and No. ' 91. hey joined up slowly and carefully and we thundered off toward the northwest , leaving Iwo snugly asleep . Low stratus clouds began to thicken underneath us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercast. 7:4O a.m . Capt . Parsons crammed his lanky frame down behind the A-bomb once again . In minutes , he had completed arming it . Now the bomb was " live . " It could be dropped at any time . Capt . Parsons put away his sheet of instructions . We poured the coal to her for the last climb . We would strike from an altitude of 31,000 feet . 8:30 a.m . We had maintained complete radio silence since we broke off from Ed Dahl . Now a coded message came in to us from Capt . Claude Eatherly in one of three weather planes . " Ten miles visibility , 2 10 cloud cover at 15,000 feet over Hiroshima . " Because the weather was clear , Hiroshima was chosen . One of the alternate targets was Nagasaki . Hiroshima , population 344,000 , headquarters of the Second Japanese Army , site of the largest quartermaster depot in the world , and a large and important port of embarkation , had 45 minutes to live . 9:00 a.m . We had made our landfall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east in a feint . We turned the radar off . From then on , we flew manually , taking the headings that Ferebee fed us as we neared our target . Parsons , his high forehead sweating a little now , picked up his instruction sheet and squeezed down into the bomb bay AUGUST 1957 21  | for a last anxious look at his handiwork 9:12 a.m . We were at our IP , initial point , and heading almost due west . Maj. Ferebee took over for the three-minute bomb run Radioman Richard F. Nelson , PFC. sent out one long beep to advise Capt Sweeney and Maj. Marquardt in the other two planes that we had only two minutes to go . With 20 seconds to go , he would send out a steady tone that would be cut o$ only when the bomb was released . 9:15 a.m . Bomb away ! Tibbets yanked off the autopilot , hauled the plane over into a 60-degree bank , and nosed her down to pick up speed . We had 43 seconds to get away before hell broke loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew had put on his welder 's glasses , but now , in this crucial moment , we found that we could not fly the plane with them on . We threw them aside and rolled out on a heading of 60 degrees . . . and the cockpit filled with a sickening purple light . Almost immediately , the Enola Gay . now 12 slant-miles from the burst , bucked and dropped earthward , caught in the shock wave . A few seconds later , the echo of the shock wave slapped her side and tossed her up again , only to let her drop . Within three minutes , the mushroom cloud that was to become the symbol of the atomic age had climbed to our altitude , 30,000 feet . Below us , 78,150 men , women and children lay dead or dying . 13,983 would be reported missing . And 37,425 more were wounded . The code word went out for " Mission Accomplished , " and we headed southeast . sober at first , then chattering like a bunch of school kids . Hopefully , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered , but it did not come . Only after the same chaos had been unleashed on Nagasaki three days later would the fanatical Japanese war lords capitulate . At 1500 hours that afternoon ? 5 hours and 45 minutes into the age of atomic warfare ? we touched down at Tinian . It had been a long flight . SCIENCE
