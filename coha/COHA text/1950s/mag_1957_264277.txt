After seven years of often bitter debate , the Federal Communications Commission said last week that it will " consider " applications from any television station that wants to take a try at pay-as-you-see TV . FCC opened the door to all the many pay-TV systems now being developed instead of okaying only one or two , as telecasters had expected . Each system thus will scramble to sign up stations for its service and to corner the limited supply of performing talent and first-run movies . This may pinch the viewer ; since his set can be adjusted to receive only one pay system , it will be blacked out of the good shows on the other systems . The sweaty competition will also spur attempts by the established free TV networks to muscle out the pay-TV upstarts . Yet some of its most ardent opponents were pleased that pay TV will be put to a three-year test . Said American Broadcasting Co. ' s Vice President Sterling C. ( " Red " ' ) Quinlan : " I hope pay-TV falls right on its rump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it has got to be tried . " <P> Static . Many FCC commissioners predict privately that not enough of the public will pay for toll TV to make it practical . Although the FCC 's decision will help resolve the issue , it will also set up many hurdles for pay-TV proponents . <P> Each station that wants to try pay TV will have to petition FCC for permission . Furthermore , the commission will not entertain any applications until after March 1 . Thus it skillfully tossed the problem to Congress , many of whose members oppose pay TV because powerful pressure groups , e.g. , unions and veterans ' organizations , have protested that it will be an added expense on family budgets . Congress could effectively discourage pay TV by setting up rigid standards for performance . Arkansas Democrat Oren Harris said that his House Commerce Committee will investigate , and Brooklyn Democrat Emanuel Celler has authored a bill to make pay TV illegal . <P> The powerful TV networks will wage the strongest campaign against the pay system . So will their admen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They argue that pay TV will drain the free networks of talent , penalize the majority in favor of the minority that would be able to pay for a better show . Cracked CBS President Frank Stanton : " Television could not long remain half free and half fee . " <P> Scramble . The problems are compounded because only one of the many experimental pay systems is likely to survive , and stations that bet on a loser will suffer . New systems are coming out all the time . Solomon Sagall , a founder of Britain 's TV-pioneering Scophony , Ltd. , last week filed to patent a system that will send a clear picture but add sound only when a subscriber flicks a switch . Says Sagall : " The picture teases you to buy . " <P> Nevertheless , the race centers on three major companies : Manhattan 's Skiatron Electronics and Television Corp. , Los Angeles ' International Telemeter Corp . ( 88% owned by Paramount Pictures ) , Chicago 's Zenith Radio Corp .. which pioneered toll TV in 1947 . All three transmit scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins into a box affixed to the set or by slipping a billing card into a slot on the set .
