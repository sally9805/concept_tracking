In the great mosque at Fez , religious capital of French Morocco , the bearded priests of the Prophet met one day last week to give nationalism a religious blessing . To France 's Resident General in Rabat , the political capital , they sent this solemn message : " A sacred religious obligation is imposed upon us to counsel the right , to reprove the wrong . . . We judge it opportune to demand in the name of Islam and of the Moroccan people the return of their legal sovereign , Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef , to the throne . " Then , in secrecy , the priests reached another decision . Suicide is a deadly sin in Moslem theology , but the conclave decided to sanction the use of cyanide capsules by any Moroccan patriot who might be captured by the French . <P> Bloodshed was one result . After a generation of unfulfilled French promises to move towards home rule , Morocco crackled with sporadic murders and riots . Its 5,000,000 Arabs ( 60% of the total population ) demanded that the French restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faithful , whom the French deposed a year ago this month and exiled to Madagascar with a retinue of concubines . The rebels were led by an outlawed party of once moderate nationalists : the underground Istiqlal . <P> Colonial Police State . Sultan Ben Youssef 's crime had been to lend his royal support to the nationalist movement . His mortal enemy was cunning old El Glaoui , the Pasha of Marrakech and leader of Morocco 's 3,000,000 Berbers , a mountain people who hate the Arabs . The French backed El Glaoui , and replaced Ben Youssef with a stooge loyal to both France and the Berbers : Sidi Mohammed ben Moulay Arafa , who is aged , weak and unpopular . <P> Twice , Arab extremists have tried to assassinate Ben Arafa ; he no longer stirs from his palace in Rabat . The French , in turn , have outlawed the moderate Istiqlal , jailed 5,000 of its members ( whom they could catch more easily than the terrorists ) , and have come close to turning Morocco into a colonial police state . From these events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wave of Violence . Reported TIME Correspondent Frank White from Casablanca : <P> Morocco 's new wave of violence began one morning at 9:30 . A crowd of Arabs gathered in the market place at Fez , bearing crudely painted portraits of the deposed Sultan and shouting : " Long live Ben Youssef ! " When the police used tear gas , the Arabs showered them with stones . The police opened fire : five Moroccans fell dead and 25 were wounded . <P> The next outburst came in the oil town of Petit jean ( pop . 70,000 ) . The rumor ( entirely false ) had got about that Ben Youssef had escaped from Madagascar and was on his way home . A mob collected , and in half-patriotic , half-religious frenzy , turned on Jewish shopkeepers , killing six and burning their bodies .
