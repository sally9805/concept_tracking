The Wild Heart ( Powell-Pressburger ; RKO Radio ) , a picturization of Mary Webb 's 1917 novel , Gone to Earth , lets passion spin the plot in turn-of-the-century England . Jennifer Jones is a simple child of nature who likes to cuddle up with her pet fox . Just when she has settled down to a calm marriage with a parson ( Cyril Cusack ) , along comes Squire David Farrar , a virile type , who whisks her off to his outsize estate . But Farrar has a crude habit of fox hunting , so Jennifer soon cools toward him . The ending is drenched in predictable melodramatics . <P> The Wild Heart often turns out tame in its preordained plotting , but the story has been imaginatively told by Britain 's **28;3956;TOOLONG team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger ( Colonel Blimp , The Red Shoes ) . * The picture has a warm , earthy flavor with handsomely photographed Technicolor scenes of the rolling Shropshire countryside . And a strong cast helps cover up some of the story weaknesses : David Farrar swaggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately pale and wan as the deserted parson . But it is in Jennifer Jones 's lush , wide-eyed performance as the passionate girl that The Wild Heart beats most strongly on the screen . <P> Clash by Night ( Wald-Krasna ; RKO Radio ) is a vapid variation on the old triangle . Based on Clifford Odets ' 1941 play about a Staten Island husband who kills his wife 's lover , the picture adds a sunshiny ending , a Pacific-coast fishing-town setting , and some fishy dramatics . <P> For purposes of movie morality , the husband ( Paul Douglas ) , after unsuccessfully attempting to strangle the other man ( Robert Ryan ) , understandingly takes back his suddenly repentant wife ( Barbara Stanwyck ) . As Barbara unconvincingly regenerated , the drama degenerates . And in Fritz Lang 's turgid direction . Clash by Night emerges as a pretentious movie melodrama swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight . <P> Paul Douglas plays the cloddish but honest fisherman husband with a good deal of earnestness , while Barbara Stanwyck gives one of her regulation good performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Ryan plays a motion-picture projectionist who speaks some grade-B movie dialogue , e.g. , to Barbara : " Your husband 's the salt of the earth , but he 's not the right seasoning for you . " Also on hand , in a minor role : shapely Marilyn Monroe . as a fish-cannery employee who bounces around in a succession of slacks , bathing suits and sweaters . <P> <P> * Filmed in 1949 , The Wild Heart has been delayed by a variety of production and post-production problems . The horsy set of the town of Much Wenlock ( pop . 2,087 ) . where much of the movie was filmed , was uncooperative during the shooting because of the novel 's anti-fox hunting message . In 1950 , dissatisfied with the finished product , Producer David O. Selznick ( who got the western-hemisphere rights to the picture in return for allowing wife Jennifer Jones to appear in it ) sued London Films Producer Alexander Korda to enjoin release of the film overseas . A British law court decided against Selznick . Last year Selznick hired Director Rouben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood for U.S. release .
