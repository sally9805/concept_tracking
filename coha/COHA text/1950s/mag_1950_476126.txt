AS ONE of his descendants remarked , the twentieth of June , 1897 , was marked by public rejoicings throughout the Empire : Ezra Quaggin had died in the night . It was also the day of Queen Victoria 's diamond jubilee . He had lived alone on his farm , working it with hired labor , sending out occasional blasts of hate at the male members of the family . Then one night when he was concealing money in the chimney he was choked by a mouthful of soot , fell , fractured his hip , and began a lingering end . He was visited in the hospital by fat Tom-Billy Teare the joiner , who had married the old man 's niece , and was troubled . But Ezra presently told him he had forgiven the females , who could not be expected to know better . " I 've seen to it that your Sallie 's all right . Now listen : me will is in a proper black box on top o ' the kitchen dresser . They all know I 've made one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do the ? th ' arrangements , y'self , Tom-Billy . Keep it in the family , like . An ' then maybe the cost . . . ? " His niece 's husband was an undertaker on occasion . Teare went away happy , full of his executorship . He told his wife Sallie , and she was content , and stayed in town on market day to buy a black dress . Five days passed . Then the sad news came from the hospital and she was able to put it on . After Teare had informed the relatives , carefully penciling down the expenses , he and his wife shut up their home in the village and moved quickly into the Quaggin farmhouse to look after it . They found the flimsy black deed-box in its place on the dresser . Having no lock it invited a look inside . Under a layer of old receipts , a backless prayer book , and letters dealing with an unsatisfactory grubber , was the will . A long sky-blue paper . It was in the old man 's handwriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meaning . Teare hugged his wife delightedly . She had been left the farm itself ! A few small bequests disposed of the Quaggins . " We 're made , woman ! " he said . But later he fell into some small dispute with the heiress when she wished to cut down expenses now that there was nobody worth pleasing . He considered a heavy meal would be necessary to keep the family quiet during the will-reading . Particularly this will . 0 N THE day of his funeral , the old man lay clean and tidy in the coffin Teare had made for him , ready for those who came to make sure he was gone . They arrived earlier and in greater numbers than expected , causing the waiting meat plates to be recast in more and smaller portions . Teare received the mourners at the door . Quaggins , most of them , the men short and sandy , sharp-nosed ; the women pale-faced and shiftily prim . Black clothes , hastily dyed , showed smothered patterns . And expectation showed through the reverence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields for valuation . People went to the windows under pretence of admiring his industry , and gazed hungrily out . The mourners ' conduct was sober while in the house ; sober , too , in the black varnished carriages as they crept in line behind the hearse ; sober and musical in the drafty little church , as they listened to a long-winded service . At the graveside they began to cheer up , for the unpleasant part of the day was almost over . On the return journey talk in the carriages grew bright . Quaggin the . Cruelty , the animals inspector , thrust his red whiskers out of a window to hail a friend . From another vehicle Teare thought he heard something suspiciously like song . He frowned at his wife . The little procession trotted briskly along the road that ran behind the village , and turned up toward the farm . A tense proprietary excitement filled each jogging group . Eyes were fixed with modest greed on every field they passed . The Dutch barn , the old pigsty , the cows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . As it drew in toward the house , he saw a figure moving near the rose-covered porch . As if coming from the side where the dairy was , and the back entrance . Teare had visions of unlocked doors . He scrambled out of the carriage . " Well , who ? ? " " Hallo , there ! " called the man . " I missed the pour ould fella , eh ? " Short and sandy , with a sharp nose . A Quaggin , undoubtedly . " Do n't ye remember me , Tom-Billy ? " " Uh ? yes . Of course . " Teare shook hands dubiously . Now he knew ; it was some sort of cousin , a man they called Lawyer Quaggin because he had once worked as an advocate 's clerk . Then a sign-writer or something , and for a time , they said , he had tried to live by raising ferrets . A spry man . " Hallo , all ! " called Lawyer Quaggin . People were descending from the carriages . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train for me , an ' I came too late for to see him under ! " The relatives hailed him , crowding round . Teare hurried in after his wife . He motioned her into the kitchen . " Sallie , just a minute --  " Outside in the hall they could hear old Mrs .. Kneen weeping over " the beautiful interment " and the bass voices of her three sons . " Well ? " said Sallie . Teare jerked his head and whispered , " Did y ' see that Lawyer character ? Skulkin ' round the house just as we come up . Keep an eye on him ? he 's fit for anythin ' , that fella ! " The parlor was already seething . Teare dodged about , fitting people into places for the meal . The three huge Kneen boys were prowling gloweringly about , comparing the size of the platefuls . A child cried to be taken home . Then somehow a chicken had got into the room , fluttering among the black legs . Women pulled their skirts out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation Teare grabbed a thin arm that led to a long face . " Mr. Cain , for pity 's sake start a hymn or somethin ' ! " The thin man struck a fork on a plate and began to sing " Abide with Me " in a grating voice that struck piercingly through the uproar . Gradually silence came . The Quaggins sat , unwillingly , one by one . " So beautiful , " said old Mrs. Kneen in the hush that followed the solo . She added , to the thin man 's confusion and anger , " I mean the way the table is Iaid . Look at it , boys. - Soon Sallie had the tea-urn working and there were polite murmurs of appreciation . Every one held back patiently while cups joggled perilously round . Then the food went down with a rush , Quaggin the Cruelty called for a second cup through steaming whiskers . The Kneen boys tore seriously at their cold beef . Pickle glasses emptied . Faces bulged . Tom-Billy glanced round . Lawyer Quaggin was at the second table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quiet . Teare shifted back uneasily . The meat was tasteless in his mouth . " My boys say they 're enjoying it ever so much , my dear , " called Mrs. Kneen . Her sons chewed on , unnoticing . Teare whispered to his wife , Is anybody out watchin ' the kitchen ? " She shook her head . His face sagged . " Come , come , Mr. Teare ! Eat up ! " said a neighbor . " Do n't let the sad business distress ye too much ! " Plates were collected and fresh courses sent round . Creamy cakes and scones oozing with butter . As appetites grew less , droning reminiscences began . Teare heard everywhere the working-out of remote family connections . He suddenly stiffened . His wife had nudged him . She whispered , " Look ? Lawyer ! " He screwed round , trying to make his face seem lightly interested in the company . Lawyer Quaggin 's place was empty . He was not in the room . ' Tom-Billy half rose . He sat again , heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " " No , I just turned round . and ? oh , look , look ! Here he is again . " The short sandy man was sliding into his seat , a strange look upon his face , it seemed to Tom-Billy . A mixture that might have been self-conscious innocence and satisfaction ; uneasy satisfaction . He caught Teare 's eye and grinned . A nervous smile that suddenly became too hearty . Torn-Billy felt his face tighten . He stood up . One or two people looked at him , and his wife 's hand touched him warningly . " Uh ? get more bread , " he mumbled , and pushed his way between the chair-backs . Once the door was safely shut behind him , he ran the few steps to the kitchen . He pulled a stool up beside the dresser , climbed on to it , and clutched the tin deed-box down from its place . A bead of sweat fogged his eye as he opened the lid . The heart folded up inside him , and he grasped a shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E STUMBLED down , and scattered across the table all the contents of the box . The loose papers , the prayer book , the letters . He swayed as the empty black bottom of the tin stared back at him . A moment later an old chair 's wicker seat split under his sudden weight . Like scalding steam , a stream of explosive , hissing curses reddened his face . Then the remembered need for silence bottled up his fury , and drove it into his head and muddled his thoughts . They took several minutes to clear . It was Lawyer all right ! He must have found out the will 's hiding place by spyingthrough the kitchen window during the funeral . And now he had stolen it ; the guilt was there on his face when he sneaked back into the parlor just now . Tom-Billy sat trying to control himself and picture the next move . The other room was full of Quaggins waiting to hear the thing read . If he showed the empty box , they would rend him , the keeper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything ; each man jack of them would fancy himself cheated out of a huge legacy . Go in there and denounce the thief ? No , that was as bad . Lawyer would be ready , knowing the Quaggins distrusted him nearly as much as they did Tom-Billy . He would have the will hidden somewhere , and brazenly deny everything . And later , in his own crafty time , he would tell the Quaggins in secret what it said . Either way , the will would never be seen again . The farm would be divided amongst the whole brood . Tom-Billy groaned with anguish . Something must be done immediately ; he had no idea what . Often he had wondered what a fattened beast felt when it sniffed the smell of slaughter . Now he knew ; it prayed for the neighborhood to be struck with catastrophe , to give it a chance of escape . An earthquake . At least a whirlwind . Words were dancing in front of his eyes . " All your problems solved , " they read . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seemed to be printed on a packet lying by the wall . A little more cold sweat formed on his face . He rose . He approached the improbable packet . " Vesuvius Brand Lighters . All your fire-lighting problems solved ! " he read . So he still had his senses . His pulse slackened . He saw he had been tricked by the crumpled label . A bag of patent things that Sallie must have bought : old Quaggin would have died of cold before spending money on them . " Vesuvius Brand . " There was a clumsy little picture of people in long nightshirts running about clutching bundles and boxes , and a flaming mountain in the background . He slowly picked up the smelly packet . A desperate idea was coming . The most desperate he had ever had . Through the smoke faces were hard to recognize . He felt a small draft of despair ; if Lawyer had run away , the whole plan was wasted . Suddenly he saw the little clerk on the other side of the kitchen , jostled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked nervous . T ERRE sprang for the dresser and snatched down the black box . Almost in the same movement he had Lawyer held fast in the hug of a thick arm , and rushed him strongly through the burning room to the yard door . Into clear earshot of everybody ; particularly the women . " Here , take this ! An ' keep it safe ! " he shouted . " Uncle Ezra 's will is inside it ! " For a moment their eyes locked . Seeing the fury in Lawyer 's , Teare knew he had been right . There was a tense pause in the clattering and fuss and sluicing of water . The word " will " had struck home . Every jealous eye was on the little foxy man clutching the box . " Watch it close and no monkey business ! " Teare yelled after him , with a wink round at the rest . He felt that the wink was a good touch . Now he had to make sure Lawyer was left alone with it . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With something like cheerfulness , he flung himself at the dying fire . The Quaggins followed suit . Torn-Billy busied himself in the yard , finding work for every pair of hands . Except one . Lawyer sat alone in a strawy corner , the box on his knees . But there must be no witness to say he had not meddled with it ; Teare kept every one on the move , shouting at them , directing , comforting . His flannel shirt was soaked with sweat as well as water . Once he caught sight of Mrs. Kneen approaching Lawyer as if to sit and share his guardianship . He ran and caught her arm . " Oh , Mrs. Kneen , would ye look to the child yonder ? I think she 's taken with fright ! " Lawyer glowered . A minute or two later , when Teare turned from dousing the last smoldering remains of the table , the corner was empty . He thought he glimpsed Lawyer , slipping round a corner of the cowhouse . The idea must be working ! " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys from inside . Water dripped from everything in the kitchen and swilled across the stone floor . The ceiling was blackened . Otherwise damage was small , though wives ' voices rose when they saw their men 's singed suits , and the Cruelty was anxiously feeling the shape of his beard . Dye had run on splashed dresses . Tom-Billy pulled a sack over his shoulders and looked round . There must be no waiting . " Where 's ? who did I give it to ? The will box ? " He hoped his frown looked honestly puzzled . They knew . " Lawyer ! " shouted voices . " Where 's Lawyer ? I seen him a minute ago ! " The unmistakable cry of hungry , suspicious animals . " Where did he get to ? Lawyer ! Did you see him go ? " " Lawyer , the fire 's out ! " shouted Quaggin the Cruelty . " Where the divil have ye put yeself ? " " Lawyer ! Lawyer ! " There was a hush . T . HE little foxy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in his hands . His hair seemed a brighter ginger , or his face was whiter . Suspicious eyes were all on the tin . Without a word , expressionless , Lawyer handed it to Torn-Billy . This time his eyes told nothing . " Ah ? thanks , " Teare said . " We would n't have had this lost for the world , eh ? Thanks for keepin ' it safe , Lawyer . " There was a chorus of excited approval . " Good oul ' Lawyer ! Bad job if the will had gone on fire ! " " If they found even a singe --  " " Better make sure it 's safe , " said the man who had suggested the reading . Torn-Billy 's hands trembled violently as he put the box down among the trickling water and singed cushion feathers that covered the yard . " Heat injures the nerves , " murmured Mrs. Kneen , interestedly ; nobody noticed her . The black box squeaked open . Tom-Billy 's hand went inside and fumbled quickly . A pause . . He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This aforesaid document , " he read shakily , " is the only will whatever of me , Ezra John Quaggin , pig , general , dairy , and poultry farmer --  " His head sang with relief as he looked THE ISLE OF MAN 9 round the yard at all the grimy , eager faces . " Go on ! Go on , Tom-Billy , " they cried . He found the place , cleared his throat , and read again . Soon , he knew , the real fun would begin . Oh , Mirror , Mirror T HERE 'S no call to start so , Judith . It 's only your auntie . Lie back in the bed now . Let me pull the covers round you against the draft . And a sip of water : your forehead 's hot . No , you 're wrong , dearest . It 's hot , not normal . So often that way ; I do n't like it -- Oh ! You must n't listen when I say such things , talking to myself . I 'm such a silly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it feels cool to you , but then ? never mind ! Poor little Judy ! I 'm going to sit with you for a while . There ! What jolly cane chairs you have in your room , have n't you ? I think they are two of the cosiest in the whole house . Age does n't matter with really good articles , you know that . Do n't you ? And fumbling repairs sometimes spoil things we 've grown used to , and fond of . Now I want you to lie quite still and restful . I 'm going to talk to you , dear . Yes , it 's about what happened yesterday afternoon . Wo n't you tell me why you did it , Judith ? You may as well . Because I know anyway ; more than you do . No ? No ? Do n't hide your face like that ! Oh , it hurts your auntie more than you can tell when her little girl wo n't speak to her . Yesterday I was arranging her tea , and wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , clean napkin for her tray and I was cutting bread thin as thin , and cornerwise , because that is how she likes it . And then I looked out of the window . What I saw upset me very much . It was my little girl running , was n't it ? Running far down the garden to where the wall joins the big door . And peeping behind her to see if I watched . But I was behind the curtains . Then I felt something inside me . Here . A tight , cold feeling all round my heart . Because of two things . One was that she should go so terribly against my wishes . So many times I have said , since she was quite tiny , " You must n't go outside the garden , Judith , " and , " You ought never to run . " But there she was , in spite of all I had said and done for her . It made your auntie extremely unhappy , Judith . But the second reason was sadder still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying to myself , " Now she will have to be told everything , and it may break her heart . Something wicked has made her do this , and she must know , so that she can resist it . " That 's what I said to myself as I was running down the path . " She will have to be told , " I said . You were n't able to go very fast , were you , dear ? You are so young , and I am your old aunt , and yet I caught up with you among the pear trees . Was it really that you slipped upon the path ? Or was it , perhaps , something else ? Now I want you to take another sip of water ? there ! ? are you quite comfortable ? You must be very brave . Give me your hand , dear . Such a frail little hand , tight in mine . Very brave indeed , Judith . I 'll have to tell you something that will be a very great shock . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will still be a shock . Let me see . You remember that fairy tale from when you were very small ? " The Ugly Duckling " ? It looked so odd and different that the other ducks and everybody drove it away . And then it changed and grew into a beautiful swan . Do you know what " beautiful " is , Judy ? You liked that story very much , though . Now just think , dear . Supposing ? just supposing that the duckling had n't changed at all . Supposing it became a still uglier one ? That would n't have made a happy ending , would it ? Hold your auntie 's hand very tightly , my love , and try to be ever such a brave girl . You see , Judith , I 'm afraid you 're that kind of duckling . There , there ! Ever since you came here as a tiny tot with no mother and daddy , I 've known some day I 'd have to tell you that you were ? different from other people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why I have to have a high , safe wall round the garden , that you never go outside . And why your auntie takes such care of you , every minute of the day . I SUPPOSE you 've often wondered why it was like that . Have n't you ? But you 've always been so good , and done as auntie bid , and auntie loves you so very much . It would have been the same if your ? parents had lived . Your lovely mama would have done what I did : we understood each other so well , as sisters do . I knew everything she should have , every single thing that was best for her . And then she married your father ? she had no right --  We ? we 'll not talk about that . It 's only what I said before . He was n't really for her . Not for her . That 's it , he was n't ? good enough . And so , they 've both gone a long time ; and poor old auntie 's minding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know why she can not go out and see the world at last . Because she 's grown to fifteen years old . Well now , just wait a minute . Here 's the mirror , down from its hook . I can rest it against the foot of the bed . Carefully does it when the frame is loose . Can you see into it , Judith ? Raise yourself a little , dear . There . See the precious duckling clearly ? This is the part that is going to hurt , even with her auntie 's arm right round her . I want you to look at that shape in the mirror , Judy . Such a slender , curvy body , is n't it ? So soft and pale . Those swollen little breasts . Did you think that was right ? Did you ? Now look at me , dear . I 'm not like that at all . See how strong and solid I am , straight everywhere , in every line ? That 's the way people are , Judith . People outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly like the bed sheets , except for two pinky cheeks and red lips . Eyes as blue as ? copper rot . Mine are dark brown , and my skin is dark and tough . And hair ? look in the mirror , dear ; see that thin , soft , shiny yellow , like fading grass ? Not thick and black , like other people 's . My little Judy ? crying ! Oh , what sobs ! You just did n't know how ? different you were . I 've always kept it from you . That is why there are no pictures of people in the rooms . I did n't want you to be hurt . Brown-skinned and hard , they are , with strong black hair . I 'm one of them . So I can go out and talk among them . And they do n't know about you , these dark people . Only I think of my little girl at home that 's ? different . Now , Judy , do you know what would have happened if your old auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop you and guide you back to this house ? Do you know what would have happened if you had gone past the pear trees and the green water-tank , and up to the big door ? And if it had n't been locked ? but it always is ? and you had opened and walked outside ? Something very horrible , Judith . You would have seen people like me ? all like me , Judy , only not smiling , I 'm afraid . You would have seen them halt in the distance , and point , and murmur to each other in their dry , gray roads ; and move softly in the shadows . And presently as you walked , you would hear tiny shufflings and mutterings . And you would glimpse a head of a person on the other side of a wall , keeping pace with you ; or a gray hand signaling in a doorway . And then things would come quietly through the hot dust . They would be people . And they would be following you . Because you were different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duckling ? People can be far crueler . You might speak to one of them ; but your voice would be tiny with fright . His head would turn away , with eyes remaining on you , and he would talk loudly and hard . Not to you : to the others . You would feel the whisper run through , sealing them against you , and teeth and eyes would shine out from the whole band of them . Then they would be thrusting , jostling , screaming ; and all the roads clattering with laughter . " Look at the eyes ! " they would shout . " See it ! How it cries ! There , it is running ! " And the shouts would become the echo of your own feet beating along the middle of the lanes , and the stones ringing under them . Running until you could n't go any longer ! And behind , they would be coming , closing on you ! Like one of those dreams auntie calls nightmares ; but this time it would be true , Judy . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible to be different . But your auntie 's here . She understands . And there 's a high wall , and nothing to be afraid of , if they do n't see inside . And when you make that singing , or sit watching the clouds and wondering , or tremble at the thunder , there 's only auntie to know that you 're doing what no one else does . Is n't there ? And auntie 's your friend who understands . . My Judith is brave , and she wo n't cry any more now , will she ? Just one last look in the mirror at that strange little face , so that she 'll know finally what her auntie meant . Oh , my poor girl ! Ca n't she bear to look ? Ca n't she , then . Do n't hide in the bedclothes , dear . You 're never strange to me , you know . Take the mirror away ? Wait , Judith . I 've something for you . I knew what a horrible shock it would be , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There . Right in her little hand . Do you know what it is , dear ? A bottle of stain ? quite harmless brown stain . It smells rather sweet . If she wants , she can add a little to her washing water . To darken those hands and those pink and white cheeks . And when she looks in the mirror , she wo n't seem so different after all . She can pretend to be like me . Ca n't she ? And after that we must simply be patient , and auntie loving , because we have n't so very long in the world , have we ? And if we 're not ordinary --  Now if the little girl stops crying , and lies quietly and still , she shall have a plate of bread and butter cut just as she likes it . And some little secret treat . Her auntie will sit with her in this beautiful cosy room , and we shall have a game of ludo . For I understand . And she 's my very own . For always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
