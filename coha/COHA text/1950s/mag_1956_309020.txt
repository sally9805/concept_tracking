The bulletins from Washington that were front-paged across the nation one day last week held sensational legal and social implications : the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that segregation is unconstitutional even on buses operating within single states , on the basis of the Fourteenth A.mendment . <P> That was enough to send many a major and minor Southern politician , including the governors of North Carolina , Georgia and Virginia , and the attorneys general of Texas , Virginia and South Carolina , into a spate of purple phrases . " I hereby defy the ruling of the Supreme Court , " snapped C. C. Owen , president of the Alabama Public Service Commission . Yet , elsewhere in the South , e.g. , in Richmond , Little Rock , Dallas , many a bus driver calmly removed signs directing Negro passengers to the rear . In the North there was a crackle of excitement : newspapers front-paged the story , and editorial writers pontificated about constitutional law and the new need for wisdom and forbearance on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line . <P> It all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years , triggered by a U.S. Supreme Court order so terse that the entire Washington press corps misunderstood it . " The appeal is dismissed , " the Justices said , as they refused to accept an appeal of a case in which a lower court had held South Carolina 's bus segregation law unconstitutional . Then the Supreme Court cryptically cited an obscure , 27-year-old Nebraska civil case , Slaker v. O'Connor , that touched off the bulletins . Actually , the only relationship between Slaker v. O'Connor and the case at hand was that both had reached the Supreme Court improperly , i.e. , before being tried in lower courts . <P> As the last clich died away , a sheepish realization dawned that about all the U.S. had witnessed was a demonstration of how tautly its racial nerves are stretched . There was , nonetheless , a silver lining : some of the Southern bus lines that prematurely took down their segregation signs found the new arrangement working so well that they decided to leave things that way .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
