At their Manhattan convention last week , U.S. newspaper publishers took up a growing problem : " creeping censorship , " notably by Government departments . Said Charles F. McCahill , general manager of the Cleveland News and president of the American Newspaper Publishers ' Association : " Many bureaucrats in government appear to prefer to function without knowledge of the people . . . We have had too many instances of efforts to suppress information . . . " <P> The bureaucrats were encouraged by President Truman 's often belligerent attitude towards the press and by his executive order ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) giving each bureau authority to declare any of its information secret . As the publishers knew , the order had encouraged bureaucrats to 1 ) keep more &; more information from the press , 2 ) put statements " off the record " which did not belong there , and 3 ) try to intimidate reporters in quest of the news . <P> FBI agents have repeatedly questioned or investigated columnists , and Pentagon reporters are frequently followed by the Army 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter wanted to give away genuine military secrets . But stories had been held up for " security " when the real reason was interservice rivalry , e.g. , the Air Force has tried to suppress stories on the guided missiles which the Army had already approved . In many cases , no question of military security is involved . In civilian areas , Government tax agents hide most of their activities , including shenanigans , under an official policy of secrecy . And Presidential Assistant John Steelman recently set up barricades in the corridors outside his offices to keep reporters from getting to steel-strike negotiators to find out what was going on . <P> As if taking their cue from Washington , local officials are trying to keep their doings out of sight of the public . At last week 's meetings , publisher after publisher told of closed meetings held by school boards , city councils and others handling public funds . Not all the reasons were sinister ( explained one alderman : " If you quoted what we said , we would sound like fools " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the public 's business . Samples : <P> In Danville , Va. , police suppressed , for " security reasons , " the fact that General Mark Clark was arrested for speeding , <P> In Providence , it took the Journal &; the Bulletin four years and seven court actions to force tax officials to open their records of tax abatements . <P> Illinois ' attorney general ruled that reporters may be barred from committee meetings of county boards of supervisors . <P> In Shreveport , La. , the Planning and <P> Zoning Commission meets in secret , for no valid reason . <P> In &; around Albany , N.Y. , 368 bars had been caught watering their whisky . The Internal Revenue Bureau let them off with token fines , and the bureau 's Chief Counsel Charles Oliphant declared that such " confidential compromises " were none of the public 's business . ( Oliphant resigned during the investigation of tax scandals. )
