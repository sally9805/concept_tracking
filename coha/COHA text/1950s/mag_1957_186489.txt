A blonde , 25-year-old woman walked nervously into a large classroom in Geneva one day last week for one of the most exhausting ordeals of her life . Before her sat six facultymen , including experts in English , French and Italian . Behind , a crowd of students waited eagerly to see her perform . They had good reason for wanting to do so : of 750 students at the Interpreters ' School , Giovanna Cuirlo of Genoa was the only one found qualified this term to try for the school 's highest prize-the conference ( or parliamentary ) interpreter 's certificate . <P> As Giovanna took her seat and opened her pad , the school 's Dean Sven Stelling-Michaud launched into a twelve-minute speech in fast-paced French ( " The new member-state of Viet Nam is particularly happy to be able to participate in the work of the World Health Organization . . . " ) . With scarcely a second 's delay , Giovanna read back the speech in Italian . After that a professor delivered another speech in <P> English which Giovanna read back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Common Market . These Giovanna translated into English and French . <P> Only a Handful . Having passed the first hurdles , Giovanna was ordered into a U.N.-type interpreter 's booth for a more difficult test : the simultaneous rendering into Italian of a speech in French , a second in English . Finally she took her place behind a " delegate 's desk " and was ordered to do the same thing all over again , this time translating the text on sight . The ordeal over , the professors made their decision : Giovanna had passed . <P> In its 16 years the Interpreters ' School has turned out only a handful of Giovannas . Since 1951 only 35 have made the grade . But the school 's standards are so high that even students with the less difficult translator-interpreter 's certificate or the simple " language certificate " find jobs without trouble . As a matter of fact , to have completed the school 's courses at all is proof enough that a man or woman is much more than an ordinary linguist . Today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate words and sentences instantly ; they must also have background enough to be able to render shades of meaning and to place emphasis where the speakers want it . " We know our requirements are difficult , " says Dean Stelling-Michaud , " but they have to be . " A translator who is merely a babbling robot can endanger a whole international conference . <P> So Many Conferences . Founded by a Belgian-born League of Nations interpreter named Antoine Velleman , the school began with only 20 students in one of the buildings of the University of Geneva . By 1951 , when Dean Stelling-Michaud took over , Geneva canton authorities were so impressed by it that they agreed to help finance it . Stelling-Michaud added modern equipment for simultaneous translation , built up one of the largest dictionary libraries in the world . By 1955 the school had become an autonomous part of the University of Geneva .
