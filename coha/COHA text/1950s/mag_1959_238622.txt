The open season on culture in Manhattan used to begin with the first stroke of a Metropolitan Opera baton . But last week , with the Met season still a fortnight away , the town was jumping with cultural high jinks to satisfy almost any taste . Among the early season successes : <P> Symphony . The New York Philharmonic returned in triumph from its ten-week , ANTA-sponsored tour of Europe and the Near East , was greeted at Carnegie Hall with a red carpet , laurel-draped boxes , and placards reading " Welcome Home , International Heroes ! " All told , the orchestra had played a brain-fogging total of 50 concerts in 29 cities of 17 countries . Unfortunately , the pace showed . The program was one that Bernstein and crew had played repeatedly in Europe : Beethoven 's " Egmont " Overture and Triple Concerto ( with Lenny conducting from the piano ) , Shostakovich 's Fifth Symphony . Conductor Bernstein gave it all his familiar body English , and the orchestra plugged hard , but the sound was sometimes edgy . And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own garish pretensions . Nevertheless , Lenny and the orchestra won a standing ovation . <P> Opera . The New York City Opera , which sandwiches its six-week fall season into the post-Labor Day lull before the Met 's opening , was offering one of the most imaginative seasons of its inventive career . For his opening , Director Julius Rudel presented an improbable but highly successful pairing of Igor Stravinsky 's austerely stylized Oedipus Rex and Carl Orff 's lightly lyrical Carmina Burana , both conducted by Leopold Stokowski . The audience took to the double feature so enthusiastically that an additional performance was scheduled for last week . The season 's second big hit : a superb production of Mozart 's crystalline comic masterwork , Cosi Fan Tutte . Vienna-born Director Rudel , 38 , is also offering the standards-Madame Butterfly , Boheme , <P> Carmen , Traviata-plus Kurt Weill 's Street Scene and a new production of The Mikado . The very variety of the season , he thinks , is a tribute to an audience that cheerfully accepts City Center 's small-scaled , tightly budgeted productions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this audience , " says he . " They do n't want just to sit back and feel gorged . "
