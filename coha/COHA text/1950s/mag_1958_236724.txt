During the wave of rapes and stabbings in New York City schools this winter , the South 's segregationist dailies pounced jubilantly on the story as a Yankee-sent sermon on the evils of mixing the races in the classroom . When a Brooklyn principal killed himself during a grand jury investigation of violence at his junior high school ( TIME , Feb. 19 ) , Mississippi 's extremist Jackson Daily News front-paged the story with a picture of a Negro policeman guarding the school . Caption : " Mixed school violence led to this . " <P> The facts did not support such racist conclusions , and despite pressure from Southern editors , the wire services refused to give that slant to their reports on Northern school delinquency . Many Southern editors nonetheless echoed the Montgomery Advertiser 's taunt that the real story was being suppressed by ' ' such deluded racists as the New York Times . ' ' ' ' A widely distributed series of cartoons in the Nashville Banner derided " Mixiecrats " and " Bleeding Hearts , " pictured the North 's " objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages . When newsmen such as the Atlanta Journal 's Managing Editor William Ray tried conscientiously to dig deeper by demanding a racial breakdown of the 644 students expelled from New York schools as troublemakers , they ran afoul of school regulations that forbid such identification . <P> A Place in Society . Last week the Southern editors finally got firsthand coverage of the racial angle in New York 's school problem from a first-rate Southern reporter . To cover the story in depth the United Press assigned able , Georgia-born Alfred G. Kuettner , the U.P . ' s longtime Atlanta bureau chief . Promised the U.P . ' s Executive Editor Harry Ferguson : " If there are any squawks , I 'll be your lawyer . " <P> Hard-driving Reporter Kuettner , 44 , spent a week prowling the city from the cluttered streets of East Harlem to the seedy side of Brooklyn , talked to school officials and students , white and Negro members of teen-age gangs , storekeepers and social workers , judges and Mayor Robert Wagner . Result : a perceptive , carefully documented three-part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in honesty find that actual racial conflict is causing the rampage of juvenile delinquency . You can not but admit that Negroes , white children and Puerto Ricans get along amiably in their classes . " <P> Al Kuettner also reported that the racial issue is " at least partly to blame , " that Negro and Puerto Rican children cause " a huge percentage of the crime and violence . " But , he found , " mixing of the races is not the basic cause . " As a tough-minded Brooklyn principal told him : " This problem is not because Negroes are Negroes , it is because they are newcomers . They are often at the bottom of the economic scale . " The school man added an observation of equal relevance to the South : * " It is a sociological truth that until a person finds his place in society , he is rebellious . "
