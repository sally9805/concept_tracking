The black financial magic by which governments raise or lower the value of their currencies amid incantations of economic mumbo-jumbo is apt to baffle all but the most sophisticated spectators . But last week the government of " backward " Indonesia , whose guilder was badly inflated , devised an ingeniously simple new method that anyone could grasp , for letting the air out of their currency . Indonesian Finance Minister Sjafruddin Prawiranegara ordered Indonesians to get out their scissors and cut in half their paper money above five guilders . <P> The left halves of the banknotes will be legal tender at half their face value until April 9 . Then they are to be turned in for a new currency , worth half of the old . The right halves will , " in due time , " be redeemable for 3% government bonds . At the same time , the government 's magical scissors also cut the Indonesians ' bank accounts : half of all accounts over 400 guilders ( $100 ) , with some exceptions , will be set aside as a forced loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut sharply the effective demand for goods in Indonesia . This , in turn , will bring the Indonesian price level in line with that of other countries . <P> All the Indonesians needed now was scissors and some money-and a great many of them had neither .
