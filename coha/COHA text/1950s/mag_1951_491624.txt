+Ala WW1 . CI : In a rifle company of 180 men , 37 cook , Legit records , or do something besides fight . HIS is a report on a long and difficult inquiry . It began in Korea , at the front , some months ago . It continued in the Pentagon , through a maze of statistics , a dreary wilderness of tables of organization and equipment . It ended with some exceedingly unpleasant discoveries . Everyone sees today that the defense of the United States demands the calling up of millions of men , the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollam . But very few people see that this country 's defense also deritands drastic changes in our military habits , which are out of date , and radical reforms of our military services , whose organization reflects these out-of-date habits . To put the horse of conclusion before the cart of proof , we can not hope to survive the present world struggle so long as a Pentagon investment of men and resources earns only about one third the return in fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why great changes and reforms are now urgently needed . Never before in history have Americans been required to think about these complex problems of military methods and organization , which have been considered the private preserve of professionals in uniform . We must think about these problems now because , since the Korean aggression , the immense contest between the free and slave parts of the world has been moving with breath-taking speed toward a final showdown . The showdown may occur this spring , this summer , next fall , next year , the year after that . It is entirely possible that this summer will be the time . The Kremlin is forcing the pace ; and who can be sure of anything , except that the showdown will probably come soon ? In these grim circumstances , every American ought now to face two vital facts , which most people still prefer to leave in the class of things better left unsaid . First , by its very nature , the showdown is likely to offer this country the hardest of all choices . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to war with the Soviet Union , and accepting a ten-times-magnified Munich that will insure our own eventual destruction or surrender . Second , the Kremlin is forcing the pace for an obvious reason . The planners o f Sov ie t world domination want this showdown before we can complete the rearmament of our allies under the Atlantic Pact . We must not be deterred from getting on with the task that General Eisenhower symbolizes with all possible speed , so that the greatest possible number will stand by our side in the final test . But if war comes in the near future , we Americans must expect to carry the heaviest share of the initial burden of fighting . If war comes in this way , moreover , we shall have hardly more margin in the first stages of the struggle than Britain in 1940 . We may hope  --  we must expect  --  that the strategic air arm and atomic stockpile which constitute our primary military asset will be used at the outset to cripple the vast Soviet war machine . But even cripples must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet vital centers have been most ruthlessly attacked , we shall still confront the Red Army , with its 175 peacetime divisions , its wartime potential of 300 divisions , its stupendous artillery , its 40,000 tanks , its substantial air arm and all its supporting satellite forces . This great power will roll outward over an almostdefenseless Europe and Asia until it is halted . And it will still be needful to roll back and defeat this Russian power before its new conquests can be organized against us . This job will be possible to do . Those who say it can not be done are cravens or misguided souls who , if their advice were followed , would in the end bring about the defeat of this country and the cause of freedom in the world . But those who say that the job will be easy to do are fools . If we are to do this job which may be forced upon us , every American man put into uniform or left in industry , every ton of steel or barrel of petroleum used in America or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , unfortunately , the Korean experience has warned us that our military investments of men and resources do not count to the full today . One of these reporters watched and was with the American troops in combat in Korea . No assignment has ever been more moving . But while it was deeply reassuring to see how ordinary Americans met the harsh tests of battle , it was the opposite of reassuring to see the outcome . In the first phase in Korea , after our early buildup , the North Koreans outnumbered our forces by no more than three to two . Yet this primitive enemy came close to inflicting disaster upon us . In the second stage , in the battles immediately after the first massive Chinese intervention , the Chinese and North Koreans together again outnumbered our forces by only about three to two . Yet in that November fighting we suffered a severe defeat . Throughout all this fighting , furthermore , we had on our side heavy superiority in artillery fire power , a virtual monopoly of motor transport and , most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . With these decisive advantages we ought to have made an immeasurably better showing . There was nothing wrong with the way our men fought . Hence the inference was plain : something must be very wrong indeed with the methods and organization of our armed services . In trying to find out what has gone wrong , it is best to begin at the beginning , with our own basic beliefs about ourselves , which provide the climate , so to speak , in which our armed services work and live . Specifically , almost all of us believe that the American kind of society , with its majestic industrial potential , is in all ways fundamentally stronger than the Soviet kind of society , with its limited industrial potential . " You ca n't beat American production in the end , " they say , like parrots . But the plain truth is that from the purely military standpoint there are considerable advantages on the side of the iron Soviet society , which builds a twentieth-century war machine on a lower-thanmedieval general level of life . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yardstick of every industrial society , free or tyrannical , warlike or peaceable . Soviet steel capacity is now about 25,000,000 tons per year . American steel capacity is now above 100,000,000 tons per year . The steel capacities of our allies and the satellites weigh the seeming balance still more heavily in favor of the West . Even the late James Forrestal , whose vision of the future was too correct to be bearable , used to argue that limited steel capacity would always prevent the Soviets from risking a general war . But look beneath the hopeful surface and you find a very different picture . Nazi Germany began the second World War with a steel capacity of only 23,000,000 tons , and almost won . The Nazi war planners built up the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe by allocating no more than 40 per cent of their steel output to war purposes , direct and indirect . Even in the final agony of Germany , they still set aside almost half the steel of the Ruhr for essentially civilian uses . In contrast , the masters of the Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes Hitler and his crew look like a set of triflers . While their people groan and go without , the Soviet war planners are in fact using at least 80 per cent of the whole steel output of Russia and the satellites for their war preparations . On the basis of these figures , no less than 20,000,000 tons of Russian steel are now being used , directly or indirectly , for war purposes . As recently as two months ago the American contribution of steel to the defense of the West was at the annual rate of only 7,000,000 tons . With four times the potential , We were then making one third the effort of the Russians . Yet even two months ago our economy Was already feeling some strain , while the Soviet System , after unremitting , total dedication to war , either present or future , for over twelve years , showed no signs of dislocation . This is possible for the Kremlin , not only because of the terrible controls over the Russian people but also because of the actual character and pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERE HERE the best illustration is the case of oil . Every- must recall the optimistic predictions at the beginning of the last war  --  that the Nazi war effort Would soon collapse because of its poor petroleum sources . Yet the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe were easily maintained in combat , principally by the synthetic-oil production of the Leuna and related Plants , until the end of the war , when our bombers Put these plants out of action . The optimistic Prophets had estimated Nazi oil requirements as though Germany were America , using oil to heat her houses , to fuel all her motor transport and to operate much of her industry . But , in fact , Germany used oil chiefly to make war , and thus Germany could make War on an oil income of only about 350,000 tons per Month . As for Russia , the Soviets are also short of oil , depend on the output of the highly vulnerable Baku-Batum oilfield . But they use oil for noth ? ing whatever but war . Hence the Soviet war machine can survive and fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock that would not keep the United States going in wartime for more than a couple of Weeks . In effect , the Soviet kind of economy is thus seen to have two military advantages . it can concentrate its production for war far more completely than we can , even if we mobilize . And it can withstand shortages that would cause almost instantaneous breakdown of the whole industrial and military machine in America . To be sure , we also have advantages on our side . Our main weapon is carefully calculated to destroy Soviet war output at its very sources . And even now , before any such attack , the Soviet system has severely limited productive reserves . In Russia all is sacrificed to war preparation ; there is little but war industry , and war output could not be immensely increased , even though our atomic bombs should fail . In America , on the other hand , if we have time to Mobilize , time to convert juke-box factories into military resources , war output can reach the great heights we know . Thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? our leading soldiers , like our people , have grossly underestimated the Soviet advantages and gravely overestimated the American advantages .

( Continued from Page 23 ) side  --  as though , in short , wars could not be lost in the beginning . And the bad effects of all these wrong assumptions have been heavily compounded by another influence . We have required our services to exist like desert plants , which die down for years to mere dry roots , and then burst into fantastically lush growth when the rain falls at last . The habit of lush sudden growth leads to excess , superfluity and waste , as does the conviction of having inexhaustible wealth to draw upon . The generals and admirals can not be blamed for this ; the main blame belongs to all of us as a people . But we must also realize that , whereas we could once afford the lavishness with manpower and resources that is symbolized by putting Only one man in the fighting line out of every ten or twelve in uniform , this American military lavishness has now become an easy road to national suicide . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army , Navy and Air Force , for all the services are alike in the character of their organization and methods . But the quickest way to see the danger we are in is to compare the numbers of /lien needed to maintain a Soviet and an American infantry division in battle . For our purposes , this single comparison may stand as the type of our problem . To begin with , both the Pentagon and the Kremlin have been hard at Work redesigning their divisions since the end of the second World War . The Pentagon , for its part , has continued the basic wartime models , but has festooned them with a great quantity of additional equipment , ranging from Mobile bath units to more bazookas . Thus the mere initial cost of military hardware has risen , staggeringly , for a Lou closed her eyes . Johnny said , " Yes , sir . " " Shenanigans . Cartoons . " " Yes , sir .

" new infantry division , from $14,500 , - 000 to $74,300,000 , and for a new armored division , from $30,000,000 to $200,000,000 . ( These astonishing totals were figured on a mass-production basis before the post-Korean price inflation had had much effect . They do not include the cost of the food , dry goods and other necessities for training and maintaining the men , which is figured at more than $5000 per man per year , including pay . ) Inevitably , the additiOns of equipment have set up extensive requirements for more men . In the last five years the muster roll of a full-strength American infantry division has grown ? or swollen  --  by more than a third . The ? Kremlin , meanwhile , has scrapped its old divisional model . In the last war the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving as superb cannon fodder , but not required to perform any specialized tasks , which were left to the mechanized and armored divisions . Now tanks and artillery and transport have been added to the Soviet infantry division . The organization has been changed . The muster roll has almost doubled . Tactically , the Soviet infantry division has become very similar to our own . The question remains : Whose additions have paid off ? In seeking to answer this question there are three rules to go by . The battle is the pay-off . With equally-wellled troops of equal skill and courage , what counts in battle is firepower  --  the weight of bullets and shells and rockets that can be thrown at the enemy . Weapons that are not normally used in battle and soldiers who do not normally fight in battle do not count at all . If the battle is the pay-off , our comparison must begin in the line of battle itself . Here we run into the peculiar structure of modern armies , which very few people who have not seen combat even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the interior , which is the United States , supports the zone of communications  --  Japan in the Korean war . The zone of communications , in turn , supports the combat zone . The rear area of the combat zone supports the divisions in combat . And even in the rear area of the division itself , great numbers of men are uncomfortably , but often relatively peaceably employed , supporting the nine battalions which constitute the actual battle line . The foxhole dwellers in the battalions and their constituent companies have the primary fighting task . Go behind battalion , even as far as the regimental command post , and you are leaving the line of battle in most cases . Starting then with the American and Soviet infantry battalions , certain curious differences are immediately revealed . Even here , in the front line among the foxhole dwellers , our Army assigns remarkably large numbers of men to the category of " administrative overhead . " In an American rifle company of a little more than 180 men , there are thirty-seven men whose chief jobs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or keeping records , rather than shooting at the enemy . There are fifty-six such men in our heavy-weapons company . But the Soviet rifle company has only two such men who are not mainly occupied with shooting at the enemy , and the Soviet heavy ! weapons company has only nine . Our Army also employs more men to do the same job . Our 81-mm. mortar , to give a simple instance , is served by seven weapon-crew men and ammunition carriers . The comparable Soviet 82-mm. mortar is served by only four weapon-crew men and ammunition carriers . Then , too , our Army makes considerable outlays of manpower on weapons which are primarily defensive . And our Army even allocates substantial numbers of men to distinctly questionable weapons , like the American light mortar , which most soldiers think not worth the powder to blow it to There are other , similar differences which it would be tedious to explore . The whole story is summed up in a simple set of statistics , which , since they come from an official American Army source , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry battalion of 555 men has a total firepower of 1370 pounds per minute . The American infantry battalion of 837 men has a total firepower of 1200 pounds per minute . Over all , our divisional line of battle comprises just over 7600 men with a per-minute firepower of 5.4 tons ; and the Soviet line comprises just under 5000 men with a per-minute firepower of 6.15 tons . In other words , even here in the line of battle itself , our Army uses 50 per cent more men than the Soviet army , yet achieves 13 per cent less firepower . Anyone who has seen the American armed services at work will now be prepared for the next and even more important fact . This infection of organizational elephantiasis , which first shows up in the front lines , grows more and more acute as you move toward the rear . Even in the rear area of the division , it is already very had indeed . Here , to be sure , precise comparison grows more difficult . While they have beefed up their infantry divisions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of keeping their main power of artillery , armor and transport in separate organizations , to be used by the corps or army commander wherever the fight is hottest . We , on the contrary , have adopted the practice , criticized by many military theorists , of dispersing our main power of artillery , armor and transport in " penny packets " within the infantry divisions themselves . Thus our infantry divisions have substantially more guns than the Soviet divisions . Our divisions have vastly more transport ; although the Soviet division is now wholly mobile , except that the front-line soldiers are trained strictly as foot soldiers  --  an advantage , judging by the Korean experience . And our divisions have considerably more tanks ; although the 120 American Pershings or Pattons are still at least partly balanced by the forty-four Soviet T-34 's and the twenty-three highly effective , heavily armored Soviet mobile assault guns . In this rear area of the infantry division , beyond doubt , the firepower advantage is on our side . But in this rear area of the division , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries , we employ no less ( Cont ' 41 on Page 88 ) ( Cattit d from Page 86 ) than 11,300 men , as against 5800 men in the rear area of the Soviet division . The Pentagon , in a recent release , has sought to gloze over all these facts by claiming for the American infantry division one and one half times the total firepower of the Soviet division . But the claim can only be based on all the useless carbines of the divisional cooks and bakers , all the machine guns expensively mounted on trucks and jeeps , all the showy weapons of the MP 's . In battle , these weapons behind the line are seldom or never used , unless a disaster has already occurred , and the clerks are dragged from their typewriters and the bakers from their ovens in a desperate effort to restore the situation . Following the rule that the battle is the pay-off , and taking line-ofbattle and rear areas together , the Soviet infantry division of 10,800 men appears to be almost a standoff for the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this report could be more comprehensive , it would go behind the division to the rear area of the combat zone , where corps and army headquarters , artillery and tanks exist among a welter of malaria-survey detachments , ordnance medium automotive-maintenance companies , and other recondite developments of our military art . It would go to the zone of communications , where the vast rear echelons flourish and the plump majors and balding colonels of the depots and base commands have never had it so good . It would go to the zone of the interior , where the majestic Pentagon surveys the pleasing prospect of training camps and indoctrination centers and port battalions , and God alone knows what else . But instead of trying to thread a way through this military jungle , it is easier to sum up the situation in terms of the " divisional slice . " The divisional slice is simply the total number of men an army needs to support and maintain a single division in combat . It is everyone engaged in commanding , or supplying , or caring for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon all the way to Private Jones in his foxhole with an M-1 . It is , in short , the ultimate test of how much fighting power an army gets from a given investment in man power . Significantly , when you examine their divisional slices , you soon discover another characteristic difference in Soviet and American military practice . In peacetime , the Soviet army keeps its fighting power and reduces its service elements , while our Army sloughs off its divisions and retains its service elements . Our experts say that in wartime , when the Soviet army strengthens its services to meet the strain of fighting , the Russian divisional slice will reach 22,000 men , well above the current level . Our military leaders hopefully promise , by the same token , that the American divisional slice in wartime will be 60,000 men , far below the present level . But responsible officers in the Army Field Forces privately admit that on the basis of present plans , 70,000 men is a more realistic figure for this divisional slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is clear . As of today , the United States must call up between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 men to put 100 divisions in the field . The Soviet Union . meanwhile , can produce and sustain in battle the same force of 100 divisions with only 2,200,000 men . Such is the unhappy indication that the Kremlin is getting somewhere near three times more fighting power than the Pentagon from the same military investment . Such are the bleak statistics which now foretell future misfortune for the United States , future good fortune for the Soviet Union . Fortunately , in Korea there were many plain hints that this suicidal condition can be cured by reform . Even the inexpert observer could spot ways and means of taking corrective action . In our battalions , to begin where any sound military reform must begin , there is the obvious case of the 103 communications personnel , who form the largest group of those assigned to " administrative overhead . " Communications absorb almost one man in every eight in each American infantry battalion  --  and thus divert almost one eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the enemy . Meanwhile , our battalions have two largely duplicating communications nets , radio and telephone . Although less extensive , the telephone net , with its heavy switchboard , its numerous linemen and technicians , is very costly in men . Owing to the incredible unreliability of the equipment , both nets together now do a pretty poor job of tying together the battalion , its companies , their platoons and the regimental headquarters in the rear . But why should there be two nets , one dating from the first , the other from the second World War ? Why not ask the Bell laboratories or the research division of the Radio Corporation of America to design really dependable , really sturdy , really light , portable radios to do the whole job ? If a new radio net worked even 90 per cent of the time , its performance would represent a substantial improvement on the combined performance of the present duplicating nets . The battalion could thus throw away its telephones , except for a link to regiment . If the battalion radios were simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seventy communications men per battalion . We should then approach the standard of the Soviet infantry battalion , which has only a portable radio net manned by twenty-five men . Obviously , in the abstract , it is preferable for the battalion to have duplicating communications nets , just in case , so to speak . But in practice , a saving of seventy men per battalion means a saving of 630 men in the division 's nine battalions . Any economy of men in the line certainly ought to result in proportional economies in the rear areas . By this rule , a saving of 630 men in the division 's nine battalions would mean a saving of nearly 6000 men in a 70,000-man divisional slice . And if this process worked , one third of the man power for a brand-new division would thus he released . The process could not work , of course , in the extremely crude fashion of the illustration given . Careful study might even justify our existing communications arrangements , although this is difficult to believe . What matters is the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a question that ought to be searchingly put to all officers charged with leading American soldiers in combat : " Would you rather have these pieces of equipment in your outfit , or would you prefer to go without them and have your front narrowed by the creation of additional divisions ? " This is the only way the combat value of any military investment can be practically tested . For the reasons already given , our services have never made this sort of test . They have been like the White Knight in Alice Through the Looking-Glass , adding any weapons or units they happened to like , just as the White Knight carried a beehive on his horse because he thought he might one day want some honey . At the beginning of the last war , the Army Ordnance actually defended the third turret that in those days made our tanks look like mobile skyscrapers , on the ground that this high silhouette might one day be valuable for fighting in fields of sugar cane . Today , the table of organization and equipment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to drive and maintain all of them ; yet the Swarmer exercise conclusively proved that when these divisions did their air-borne job , 600 vehicles was the absolute maximum that could be dropped to them . And once again , when you get into the rear areas , where the mobile-bath units and malaria-survey detachments operate , the headquarters grow vaster and more vast and all the innumerable little empires are built , the condition is far more serious than it is at the front . There are few weapons here . But here the competition is to see how many units can be created , and how many men can be stuffed into each unit , and how many specialist assignments can be invented to ornament each unit . The wrongness of the whole process is being constantly shown up , as in Korea itself , where a single man in the rear area of the combat zone did the job of supporting the divisions in the line that our tables of organization and equipment officially assign to three Men . But even in Korea the process was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Counting only the foxhole dwellers engaged , full time , in shooting at the enemy , we had hardly more than one fifth of our total manpower in Korea in the actual line of battle . The Chinese and North Koreans , who are of course more primitively organized than the Soviets , probably had about four fifths . Thus , although the enemy 's over-all manpower superiority was only three to two , his numerical superiority in the fighting line must often have approached five to one . In these conditions , since divisions were also asked to hold and even attack on immensely long fronts , serious breakthroughs became inevitable , despite our compensating advantages in artillery , transport and airpower . Enough has now been said to indicate that something can be done about this grave disease of military elephantiasis which so acutely afflicts us . Manpower is the scarcest commodity in the United States , the cheapest in the Soviet Union . No matter how much our atom bombs accomplish , economy of manpower will be the first requirement , if we are to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of divisions , we must have at least a few score of our own . At the same time , there are several evident reasons why we can not expect simple economy of manpower , however drastic , to achieve miracles . In brief , we can not tolerate in our Army the perfect cold-bloodedness which is the Soviet rule . A Soviet infantry division may get by with a medical battalion of eighty men , and can leave the families of the dead to learn of their losses by the long failure of the young men to come home to the villages . Our divisions can not . Again , we may expect equal bravery and far more initiative and technical proficiency from the American soldier , but we can not ask him to endure the same customary hardships as the Soviet infantryman . Another of the military advantages of the iron Soviet society is that its citizens are trained from birth as beasts of burden , and think themselves lucky to receive the Red Army rations of coarse black bread , twist tobacco and an occasional sup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally and most important of all , we can never wholly overcome the difference in mission between our Army and the Red Army . The primary mia ( Con t " ed on Page 91 ) ( Continued from Page 89 ) &ion; of the Red Army is to overrun Western Europe from prepared bases in the satellite area where great stocks of ammunition and all other supplies may be accumulated in advance . The Primary mission of our Army is to take the lead in the defense of the free world , which means fighting on the other side of one or both oceans . In effect , therefore , the Red Army needs a striking radius of only 1000 miles or so , whereas our Army needs a fighting radius of somewhere between 4000 and 5000 miles . When American general ' Acerb blame our military elephantiasis on the " softness " of our people , as is their scornful custom , about 90 per cent of what they say is mere cover-up . Rut when the same general officers point out that operating a transoceanic supply pipe line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Men than operating an overland supply Pipe line 1000 miles long , they can not be argued with . Take all these excuses together . They do not add up ? they can not be permitted to add up  --  to an excuse for the existing state of affairs . The American divisional slice must be greatly reduced . We must get more fighting Power for less manpower .
