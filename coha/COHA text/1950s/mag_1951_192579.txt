On the ninth day of the nationwide copper strike , President Truman reluctantly trundled out a Taft-Hartley injunction for the first time since Korea , sent 53,700 members of the left-wing International Union of Mine , Mill &; Smelter Workers back to their jobs . Already back at work were 8,300 employees of the huge Kennecott Copper Corp. , which had made a separate peace with the union five days before . Kennecott 's terms : a raise averaging 15 an hour ( just a fraction of a cent more than its last offer before the strike began ) , and an additional 4 an hour in pensions . When the union and the other three major companies failed to follow Kennecott 's lead , the President acted . <P> Though the nation 's copper production was almost back to normal this week , the strike will cost the defense effort an estimated 30,000 tons of copper-scarcest material in the defense stockpile-as well as the zinc and lead mined with it . Result : a complete reshuffling of defense production schedules .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
