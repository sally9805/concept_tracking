txt Radiation detection devices in the Eastern United States and Canada , at least 2,300 miles from the Atomic Energy Commission 's testing grounds near Las Vegas , Nev. , have indicated a slight increase in the amount of radioactivity in the atmosphere during the last few days . All reports , which came from widely separated points , emphasized that the radiation detected was far below the level dangerous to human or animal life . Scientists attribute the increased radioactivity to the Las Vegas tests . Speculation is that tiny radioactive particles from the atomic blasts have been carried by winds . The radioactivity is expected to persist for a week or so . The first atomic test explosion took place last Saturday . There was another Sunday , another Thursday and a fourth yesterday morning. , Radioactive snow has been falling all week in Rochester , N. Y. , two University of Rochester physicists reported . Dr. Henry A. Blair and Dr. Joe W. Howland said that the Rochester radioactivity was not detected until several pounds of snow had been boiled down , and then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to The Associated Press , Robert Conan , Professor of Chemistry at LeMoyne College , voiced doubt that the radioactivity in the snow at Rochester originated in Nevada . He cited a textbook , " Radioactivity , " by Sir Ernest Rutherford , published in 1904 , saying that " snow will carry down radioactive material that is always present in the air . " Radioactive snow also fell at Cincinnati , a physicist at the University of Cincinnati said . " Traces of radioactivity " also were found in snow that fell recently in the Fredericton area in New Brunswick , Canada , a Professor of Physics at the University of New Brunswick said . And at Quebec City , Laval University scientists reported radioactivity in snow that fell Monday . At Schenectady , Dr. Kenneth H. Kingdon , technical manager of the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory , which is operated by the General Electric Company for the Atomic Energy Commission , reported " a slight increase in atmospheric radioactivity presumably due to the same sources as that noted in Rochester . " " It should always be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to radioactivity than is the human body and that , therefore , the detection of radioactivity by sensitive instruments is not a cause for alarm , " he said . Dr. Kingdon pointed out that small amounts of radioactive materials , principally the result of cosmic ray bombardment from outer space , were always present in the air . This natural radioactivity is the " background noise " heard in detectors and is measured daily in the calibration of the detectors for scientific experiments using radioactive matter . At the Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton , L. I. , spokesmen acknowledged that there had been a " slight increase in background noise during the last few days " detected during the course of regular experiments . This radioactivity probably came from the tests near Las Vegas , they , added . Slightness Emphasized Similar increases in radiation count were reported from the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago and from the National Research Council station near Ottawa , Canada . All reports emphasized that the amount of radioactivity measured was very slight and the fact that it was detected at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The radioactivity may last a week , and then the air-borne particles will have disintegrated , according to the reports . In Las Vegas , the Atomic Energy Commission , in response to an inquiry , released the following statement : " With reference to all test detonations since the first on Jan. 25 through this morning we are able to say that no levels of radiation have been found anywhere , which could conceivably produce any damage to humans , to animals , or to water supply . " This was reiterated by the New York Operations Office of the Atomic Energy Commission . A spokesman , however , said the Rochester report and others were " being investigated . " The New York office emphasized that weather prediction facilities of both the United States Weather Bureau and the weather service of the United States Air Force were used in planning the atomic tests . Detonations are planned for times when the pattern of winds aloft will spread atomic blast products to safe levels .               @ @ @ @ @ @
