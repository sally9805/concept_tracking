Hananiah Harari is a slick , meticulous commercial artist whose sharp-focus Coca-Cola ads , whisky displays ( Old Sunny Brook ) and magazine covers ( FORTUNE ) look even more real than the photographs he often paints from . He is also a solemn abstractionist . Last week Harari 's " serious " paintings were on exhibition in a Manhattan gallery . They looked like nothing so much as houses built of cards for a game unknown to Hoyle . <P> Born in Rochester in 1912 , " Dick " Harari had " a routine academic training " there and later a modern schooling under Fernand Lger and Marcel Gromaire in Paris . Back in the U.S. he did both realistic landscapes and abstract murals for the WPA , exhibited fool-the-eye still lifes at the Museum of Modern Art and sold an abstraction to the Whitney Museum before he discovered his flair for commercial work . <P> His present double life clearly troubles Harari . Pale and frail-looking , he keeps two easels and two drawing tables in his studio at Croton-on-Hudson , N.Y. , uses one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial jobs . Like any artist , Harari longs to be both independent and popular : " I 'd like to be close to people , but you know how the ordinary Joe feels about abstractions . Without being patronizing I 'd like to be akin , to express what people are feeling . For example , there were 6,000,000 Jews killed in Europe . I 'd like to paint about that but not in a trite , illustrative way . I 'd like to paint abstractions that will move people . . . " <P> How does he plan to go about it ? Says Harari anxiously : " I just do n't know . " Meanwhile , he has a lot of work piled up ahead of him , painting pretty teen-agers and frosted Coke glasses .
