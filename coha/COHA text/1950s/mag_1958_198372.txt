What burns Dr. Fred Whipple , head of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at Cambridge , is that the U.S. shows Russian scientists its equipment for computing satellite orbits , while the Russians do not reciprocate . Dr. Whipple has just returned from two scientific conferences in Russia , where he got the " runaround " when he asked to see Russian equipment . " We were not shown , " he said last week , " any of the satellite computing equipment or centers , in spite of great efforts and many requests to see them . We saw none of the installations except the moon-watch program , which is copied from ours at the Smithsonian Observatory . " <P> Whipple does not know why the Russians were so secretive . It might be that their computing centers are part of a military program , but he has no evidence of this . Russian scientists did not explain . Several of them , embarrassed , claimed that the Soviet Union has no satellite computing center .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
