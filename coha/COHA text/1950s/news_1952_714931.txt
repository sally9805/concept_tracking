txt Cov . Stevenson , the Democratic Presidential nominee , today refused to name the officials who benefited from his special contributors ' fund in Illinois . He told a breakfast audience in Baltimore that no purpose would be served by disclosing the names or the amounts each received . breakfast ended his eastern campaign swing after which he returned to his headquarters here . He will leave Friday for a tour of midwest cities . Rejects 2 Questions The governor rejected two of seven questions asked by a reporter yesterday . The questions , given William I. Flanagan , Stevenson 's press secretary , were : 1 . How much has been in the governor 's private fund ? 2 . Who were the contributors ? 3 . Who have been the bene-ficiaries ? 4 . Did employe contributions go into this same fund ? 5 . What were the " general political purposes " for which the money was used in addition to salary supplementation ? Who Keeps Fund ? 6 . Who has been the keeper of the fund since Mulroy resigned ? The late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one fund used for special political purposes , Flanagan acknowledged to a TRIBUNE reporter early this week. 7 . Was there a balance in the fund when the governor was nominated for President , and how was it disposed of ? While Stevenson rejected the second and third questions , efforts to get answers to the others in press conferences or in statement form have failed . Questions Nixon Fund The questions were put after Stevenson asked these questions concerning Sen. Nixon 's special expense fund : " Who gave the money ; was it given to influence the senator 's position on public questions , and have any laws been violated ? " In his Baltimore speech , Stevenson said his fund , which he contended began with a balance from his 1948 campaign fund , " supplemented by additions contributed , " was used to make gifts , usually at Christmas , to key employes . " No official knew the source of the money he received nor any donor to my campaign fund the identity of the officials to whom gifts were made , nor so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided in this manner or in what amount , " Stevenson said . Drop Foundation Idea The problem , Stevenson said , has been to attract men of real competence into government Salary levels set by states are too low , he said , and he criticized the uniform salary rates set up by legislative appropriations , as against the flexible system of salaries employed for executives in business . He initiated a study of " some permanent and systematic means " to increase the compensation of key officials , Stevenson said . A suggestion to have contributions directly to the state or to a foundaticn was abandoneil as im ? practicable , Stevenson said . Besides , he added in an interpolation which was not included in his notes for the speech , the legislature would have to appropriate the money . He did not say what was wrong in that . Stevenson said he finally adopted the practice of making gifts , usually at Christmas , to selected officials . Such practice has resulted in a loyalty unexcelled , he said , citing some of the sacrifices his officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the principles of this plan I see no purpose to be served by disclosing the names ' of the officials to whom gifts were made , or the amounts . To do so would subject them to publicity which they do not deserve , and would , I believe , be a breach of faith on my part to them . " Charges Workers Tapped Altho Flanagan has told reporters the governor used contributed money for a special political purpose , such as travel and gifts , the governor has not said whether such money came from the same fund he discussed today , or from another one . Flanagan has given both answers . N. H. Hollingsworth , Republican state chairman of Illinois , has charged that state employes , in , eluding civil service employes , have been tapped for money for political purposes by the Democrats . THE TRIBUNE has established that earlier this year , before Stevenson 's Presidential nomination , state employes were asked to contribute to the " Stevenson for goy. governor " fund . It has not been shown whether that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
