Paris was set this week to welcome 2,300 musicians from the U.S. and Free Europe for a month-long festival in celebration of human freedom . The idea behind the festival , billed as " Masterpieces of the 20th Century " : to show some of the good things produced in the past 50 years " by independent creators , exercising the priceless gifts of freedom and self-expression . " The U.S. will be represented by the Boston Symphony and the New York City Ballet , by the music of such native American composers as Samuel Barber , Aaron Copland , Charles Ives , Walter Piston and Virgil Thomson and of such adopted Americans as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith . <P> From the beginning , the Paris public has been enthusiastic . When tickets went on sale in March , 700 music lovers queued up the first day . Some well-known intellectuals held conspicuously aloof . Existentialists Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir ( " We are not that anti-Communist " ) turned down bids to speak . But plenty of other certified intellectuals accepted , e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy 's Ignazio Silone . <P> Had the festival directors thought of performing any Russian music ? Director Nicholas Nabokov , Russian-born citizen of the U.S. , answered with a story that epitomized the whole point of the festival . Nabokov wanted to present part of Dimitri Shostakovich 's opera Lady Macbeth of Minsk , the story of a murderous hussy of Czarist days who winds up in Siberia . But the Kremlin had banned Lady Macbeth in 1937 , and for that reason Nabokov ran into trouble with his project . Even though the opera was performed at the Metropolitan in 1935 , there was no score available in the U.S. Nabokov cabled Artur Rodzinski , who had conducted the performances at the Met . Rodzinski replied that he had surrendered his copy long ago , after repeated requests from the Soviet embassy . Finally , Nabokov found a copy in Vienna . Now Paris will get to hear a concert excerpt played by the Berlin RIAS ( American zone radio ) orchestra under the baton of Hungarian Exile Ferenc Fricsay.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
