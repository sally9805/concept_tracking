txt Contempt citations will be sought this morning against the union and the union officials leading the strike at six private hospitals here . Attorneys for the hospitals . will argue that the union , Local 1199 of the Retail Drug Employes Union , ordered the strike of nonprofessional workers in contempt of restraining orders by the state Supreme Court . This plan was revealed as the hospitals sharply denied charges that Negro and Puerto Rican workers , who comprise more than 80 per cent of the strikers , were being exploited by " sweatshop wages . " Increasing bitterness . apparent early yesterday when Mayor Wagner recessed a long , angry session with union and hospital representatives at City Hall , was intensified by the racial exploitation issue . Slap at . Minority Seen The issue was raised at . the City Hall mcetimz by Harry Van ArAale Jr .. president of the Neer York City Central Labor Council . Mr. Van Aisdale said that the continued rot-n:411 of the six voluntary nonprofit hoz , - pitals to recognize the union could be a slap at " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. , Buttenwieser , chairman of the ' , board of Lenox Hill Hospital , denounced the exploitation charge as " wild and irresponsible . " As spokesman for the six struck hospitals , Mr. Euttenwieser said : " How ridiculous can you get ? " Our hospitals all operate at deficits . These deficits are accounted for mainly by the costs of rendering out-patient department services and maintaining in-patient wards which provide the only charitable hospital services available to many thousands from the very groups we are accused of exploiting . " But a union spokesman , Moe Foner , pressed the charge . " If these self-righteous phiIlanthropiSts would stop exploiting thousands of Negro . and Puerto Rican workers at ! $23 and $30 for a forty-hour , week , their employes would n't need their charity . " Mr. Buttenwieser 's financial , contributions to the hospitals , are exempt from Federal tax . ' The truth is that the workers , are the biggest philanthropists in the hospitals . They are striking to put an end to a system in which they are , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . " Today at 3 P. M. , Mayor Wagner will resume the City Hall talks . But the raising of the racial issue and the decision of the powerful Labor Council to support the strike dimmed hopes of an early settlement . Support Voted Mr. Van Arsdale , who had represented the union in prestrike talks at City Hall , announced the council 's decision to support the strike after a meeting of the executive board ' Saturday . He said the board had voted " food , money and . moral support " to the hospital ) workers , whose pay ranges ' from $32 to $38 a week . The hospitals were equally , adamant . Speaking for the six ! institutions , Charles H. Silver , president of Beth Israel Hospital , called the strike a failure : " All service is normal , and we are encountering no difficulties . " Mr. Silver , who is also president of the Board of Education , denounced the walkout as " an outrageous and completely illegal attempt on the part of union professionals to force recognition so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues from nonprofessional hospital employes . " He said that lawyers for the hospitals would seek contempt citations against the union " first thing tomorrow morning . " 2 Orders Involved The union will be charged with violating two restraining orders in staging the walkout Friday morning . The orders were issued Wednesday , but the union contends that they were not properly served on its officers . Leon J. Davis , president of Local 1199 , has disappeared . An order by the State Supreme Court in Manhattan directs the union to delay any walkout at five of the hospitals until a hearing at 10 A. M. tomorrow on an injunction action brought by the hospitals . These hospitals are Mount Sinai , Lenox Hill , Beth David , Beth Israel and the Bronx Hospital . A similar order by the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn directed the union to postpone a strike at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital pending an injunction hearing at 9:30 A. M. tomorrow . The third day of the strike passed without serious incident . although Beth Israel officials complained that pickets had cried " scabs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought an unusually large number of visitors . Two of the struck hospitals tightened security . Beth David ' had three city policemen stationed inside the building . Lenox Hill hired twelve men from a ' detective agency to augment its own uniformed guard . Mr. Silver , in his statementl for the six hospitals , contended that public indignation against the strikers was increasing . " This public indignation is , expressing itself in a veritable , flood of volunteers for hospital ' duties , many of them mernbersi of other unions who are incensed at a strike against the sick and ' suffering . " he said . Mr. Silver said that " only , about 1,000 nonprofessional ern- : ployes out of approximately ' I 3,500 " in the six hospitals were ! striking . He said that a count of personnet at the six hospitals showed that of Sunday 's dayv shift , totaling 2,400 nonprofessional employes , " about , 800 " had failed to report for work. , Mr. Silver said the eighty-one ' voluntary nonprofit hospitals in ' the city were " now prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the union to spread the strike to other hospitals . " Local 1199 has threatened to strike nine other hospitals . And a rival union , Local 237 of the teamsters union , threatened New York Hospital Saturday with a strike " without notice . " Mr. Silver 's statement was ; challenged by Local 1199 . AI spokesman said that the union ' would not call off the strike on the threat of legal action by the hospital management . " Their efforts to use - antilabor injunctions to thwart the legitimate aspirations of their workers in order to perpetuate sweatshop exploitation of Negroes and Puerto Ricans will meet the united opposition of the labor movement , " he said . Mount Sinai Replies Last night , Joseph Klingenstein. president , of Mount Sinai Hospital , replied to the union , charge of racial exploitation . He said that all races and nationalities were served in the hospital " with no thought other than to care for those who are sick and turn to us for help in such large numbers . " When the talks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twelve hours of negotiations , Mayor Wagner conceded that " no significant progress " had been made in settling the walkout of nurses ' aides , orderlies , kitchen help , elevator operators and other housekeeping workers . The strike was called by the union to enforce a demand for recognition as bargaining agent for the nonprofessional workers .
