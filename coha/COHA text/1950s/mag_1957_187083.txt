Bareheaded in the sunshine , President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines stood and waved one morning last week as his open Packard purred past more than 1,000.000 shouting citizens of Mexico City . At the Chamber of Deputies the President launched into his yearly report on the state of Mexico . By custom established in his four previous reports , the President spoke in his flat voice for more than three hours . But from time to time he dropped hard facts of progress that stood out like milestones . Items : <P> Gross national product for 1956 was more than $7.5 billion , up 12% from the previous record year . Production of most foodstuffs was up , with bumper crops of wheat , sugar and beans . Livestock production climbed 11% in 1956 ; fish nets bulged 48% fatter . <P> The budget was neatly balanced ; in the first six months of 1957 half the year 's $606 million had been spent . <P> Public education expenditures are more than double those in 1953 . During the past year , 1,353 primary schools were built and 270,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruiz Cortines did not pretend that the picture was uniformly bright . From September 1956 to June 1957 the country piled up an unfavorable trade balance of $55.8 million , although , said the President , 82% of it was the result of temporary expenditures ( spare machine parts , industrial equipment ) necessary for economic expansion . Even excluding Indian communities , 300,000 children have no schools and one out of every two Mexicans is still illiterate . The population of the Federal District , now 4.5 million , will probably hit 7,000,000 by 1966 , causing serious food , water and school shortages . And because of drought and population increase , corn-eating Mexico has been forced to import corn from the U.S. for its tortillas , tacos and enchiladas.
