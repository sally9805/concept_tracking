NOBLE SAVAGE : THE LIFE OF PAUL GAUGUIN ( 299 pp. ) - Lawrence &; Elisabeth Hanson-Random House ( $5 ) . <P> Every reader of Somerset Maugham 's The Moon and Sixpence knows who Eugne-Henri-Paul Gauguin was : the middle-aged Paris stockbroker who callously turned his back on business and family , fled to Tahiti and became a great painter amid the palm trees and dusky native maids . Devoted Gauguinists have damned the Maugham novel ( in which the thinly disguised Gauguin is actually an Englishman named Charles Strickland ) as six-pennyworth of moonshine . But they have never managed to scotch it . They never will , because the tale is essentially true . <P> Gauguin 's latest biographers , the Hansons , are a British husband-and-wife team who have successfully sunk their teeth into some big , meaty subjects , including Necessary Evil : The Life of Jane Welsh Carlyle ( TIME , May 19 , 1952 ) and Chinese Gordon ( TIME , May 31 ) . Gauguin is an even tougher order , not only because he needs explaining as an artist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a symbol of the conflict between art and breadwinnery , artistic duty and normal social responsibility . In their fine study , the Hansons ' own sympathy is with the artist , but never to a point where they try to suppress or distort the other side of the conflict . <P> Nudists at Tea . " I had no idea that he had a leaning toward the arts , " Mme. <P> Gauguin used to wail , in later years-much as a lifer 's wife might wail : " I had no idea he was going to Sing Sing ! " Mette Gad was a Danish civil servant 's daughter , a handsome , white-skinned Juno ( Gauguin favored husky women ) who met her fate on a jaunt to Paris in 1873 . Paul Gauguin was a strapping fellow with a bull neck , a great beak of a nose , and hooded , blue-green eyes . His stockbroker 's black business suit sat strangely on him because he looked like a pirate chief and walked with the rolling sway of a seaman .

" Oh , I was a great rascal ! " he would later say , " a remarkable liar . " In the early years of marriage , painting was one of several Gauguin hobbies ; he also fenced and played billiards . Mette thought Paul 's pictures were very pretty and perfectly respectable ( at first , they were ) . The clash came when Paul began buying paintings by a group of eccentrics who were called Impressionists-Manet , Monet , Pissarro , Renoir . They were then looked upon by the French art world as something like a bunch of nudists at a bishop 's tea . By the time Mette had borne her third child , father Gauguin had joined the Impressionist club . <P> His Study of a Nude ( 1880 ) " came into being like a bolt from the blue " and shattered a tradition " established through centuries .
