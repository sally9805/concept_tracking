Illinois ' Senator Paul Douglas knows the political risk of discussing racial tension . But last week , after a Cook County grand jury failed to indict Cicero , Ill. race rioters , and indicted instead the lawyer for a Negro mob victim , Douglas spoke a few plain , courageous words . <P> " What we need in this country , my own state included , " he said , " is a greater realization that the interests which all of us have in common are far greater than the points of difference between us . This is true for Democrats , Republicans and Independents , for the native-born and the foreign stock , for the Catholics , Protestants and Jews , for Northerners , Southerners and Westerners , and for the black and white as well . All of us are inheritors of our American traditions . We can not ignore conflicts of interests . But I ask that we meet them with understanding , not with hate ; with orderly procedures , not with mob violence . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
