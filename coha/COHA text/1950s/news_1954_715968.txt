txt Mayor Rules in Favor of Disputed Bid Mayor Kennelly ruled yesterday that the city will accept the bid of the American Incinerator corporation , D e - troit , . to construct a refuse incineration plant at Medill and Ashland ays. for $381 , - 864 . Awria.n . Kennelly thus sided with Aid . Merriam 5th , his most persistent critic in the city council , and apparently ended abruptly one of the biggest controversies over a city contract matter in recent years . Rejects Johnson 's Views At the same time he rejected the view ? of Lloyd M. Johnson , commissioner of streets " and sanitation , and administration leaders in the council . Johnson , a council subcommittee headed by Ald. Sain 27th , and the finance committee had recommended the city reject all five bids on the contract obtained last July 29 and re ? advertise for new bids on a plant twice as large . Kennelly made his decision after a 90 minute conference in his office attended by Ald. Cullerton 38th , finance committee chairman ; Theodore C. Eppig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; John F. Ward , city purchasing agent ; Samuel M. Clarke , consulting engineer ; Johnson , Merriam , and SaM . " My recommendation is that the present bid be accepted , " Kennelly announced . Then he turned to Johnson and said : " You can work from there for greater tonnage . For years we 've been trying to build up the reputation of our purchasing department . When we reject bids after they practically have been accepted we create the wrong impression . It is n't good for the city 's reputation . " Go Ahead with Plans . Council leaders promptly made clear they interpreted Kennelly 's " recommendation " as a decision . They went ahead with plans to award the contract to the Detroit company , which will build two incinerators at the site . Each will have capacity of 180 tons of refuse daily . The plan is then to seek bids on construction of two additional incinerators of the same capacity at the site , giving the plant a capacity of 720 tons daily . A complication developed in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American Incinerator , which arrived while the meeting was in progress . Smauder served notice to Kennelly and Ward that if the bid is not accepted by Jan. 15 , it should be considered as with : drawn at that time . The next meeting of the council , which must approve the contract , has been set for Jan. 15 . Cullerton said a special council meeting might be arranged to act on the matter if Smauder would not extend the deadline . In Detroit , however , Smaudensaid he would come to Chicago this week , possibly tomorrow , for conferences with city officials . If satisfied the way is cleared for the company to go ahead , he said , he would be willing to extend the deadline . He estimated the cost of constructing such incinerators has gone up 21/2 to 3 per cent since the bid was submitted . At the council meeting last Thursday , Merriam charged Sain 's subcommittee had put pressure on Johnson to change an earlier recommendation that the Detroit company 's bid be accepted . He charged the subcommittee made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excuse for rejecting the bids was laughable .
