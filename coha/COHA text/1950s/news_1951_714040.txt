txt The House of Representatives rejected today a Republican proposal to remove Dean Acheson from the Federal payroll by withholding funds for his . salary . The vote ! was 171 to 81 The method of ousting him as Secretary of State , rather than the objective , was the main issue . The decision , culminating one of the most heated debates of this session of Congress , consequently was regarded by no one as a vote of confidence in the much-criticized Cabinet officer . The " get-Acheson " effort , backed by Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , the minority leader , and other key Republicans , was pressed in the form of an amendment to a bill providing funds for operation of the State , Justice and Commerce Departments and the Judiciary in the current fiscal year . The bill was later passed and sent to the Senate on a voice vote after approval of a number of economy proposals , including one to limit this Government 's contributions to international organizations to one-third of their budgets . New attempts to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill As passed the measure carried $1,045,940,115 of appropriations , compared with President Truman 's request for $1,258,296,141 . The amendment aimed at Secretary Acheson and sponsored by Representative John Phillips , Republican of California , specified that none of the money provided by the bill could be used to pay the salary of any department head who within five years before his appointment had been a member of a professional firm that had derived income from representing a foreign government . Mr. Phillips said that Mr. Acheson 's former law firm had represented Poland , Greece and Iran , among other governments . Democrats fought the proposal as a " camouflaged bill of attainder . " A bill of attainder is punitive legislation aimed at an individual . It is forbidden by the Constitution . The showdown came on a standing vote that found only seventynine of the 200 Republican mem- bers of the House supporting the amendment . The other two affirmative votes were by Representatives E. E. Cox of Georgia and John Bell Williams of Mississippi , Democrats . Standing in opposition were all other Democrats and twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that the version of the amendment approved at a meeting of the Republican membership yesterday , 71 to 33 , was ruled out of order when it was offered in the House today . As revised to permit its consideration , the proposal omitted a provision that would have permitted the payment of Mr. Acheson 's salary on the condition that President Truman resubmit his appointment to the Senate for congirmation . Since the final version was different from the one approved at yesterday 's party conference , Mr. Martin said , it could not be regarded as carrying the official hacking of the House Republican organization and consequently failed to attract as many Republican votes as it would have otherwise . House debate on the anti-Acheson move grew so acrimonious at one point that Representative John J. Rooney , Democrat of New York , was temporarily deprived of the floor when Representative Martin angrily made a point of order that the New Yorker was violating House rules by reflecting on the integrity of Republican members . " The people in my district do not like slippery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of the bill , asserted , continu-ing : " They believe that the may to handle a situation is to walk up to it and face it squarely , unashamedly and straightforwardly ? not peep through keyholes , hide behind doors and tremble at the first sign of opposition as they did at yesterday 's Republican conference . * * * " Impeachment Is the proper course if you feel the present Secretary of State unfit for the office he holds . " By this devious attempt to cut off the salary of the Secretary of State by a new and snide version of the bill of attainder method , the gentlemen are saying nothing less than ' lynching is the proper neans of justice . " We must , ' they are saying , ' take justice into our own hands , for the American sysem is inadequate . ' " It was at this point that Mr. Martin protested and was upheld by Speaker Sam Rayburn . Mr. Rooney was permitted to retain the floor by unanimous consent , however , after he had withdrawn the offending remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again today . The few Republicans who spoke in opposition to the amendment based their arguments on the proposed-method of removing the Secretary . Aside from the anti-Acheson drive , the billion-dollar appropriations bill precipitated the harshest fight over funds for the State Department 's international information program , mainly the Voice of America radio broadcasts . As reported to the House , the measure provided $85,000,000 for those activities , or $30,000,000 less than President Truman had requested . Republican efforts to make an additional cut of $15,000 , - 000 were rejected , first by a standing vote of 167 to 136 and finally on a roll-call ballot of 245 to 141 . The amendment sharply restricting this country 's contributions to international organizations , sponsored by Representative Williams , was adopted by a vote of 155 to 137 , Yesterday , the House had approved a direct cut of $2,300,000 in the bill 's funds for such contributions . This came on top of a committee cut of $1,384,476 in the $29,300,000 budgeted by President Truman . All told , the House voted $5,775 , - 000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appropriations Committee . It also wrote Into the bill an indirect savings formula sponsored by Representative Ben F. Jensen , Republican of Iowa , that had been embodied in five other appropriations bills . The Jensen amendment would ' prohibit any agency from filling more than one out of every four job vacancies occuring in the present fiscal year , with specified exceptions .
