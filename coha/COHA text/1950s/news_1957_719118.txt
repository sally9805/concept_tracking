txt May , 1959 , is the Boston target date for completion of the proposed municipal auditorium at the 100-million-dollar Prudential Center in the Back Bay , Mayor Hynes disclosed today . The Mayor 's statement followed Senate passage of House-approved legislation authorizing Boston to borrow 12 million dollars outside the debt limit to finance the project , Only formal House and Senate enactment and Governor Furcolo 's signature on the bill , already assured , are needed before the city can proceed full steam on the much-needed facility . " The auditoriUm and the 1,000-room hotel planned as part of the Prudential Center will project Boston to the top as a convention city . Although Boston has long been among the six cities people most want to visit , lack of modern convention facilities has been a major handicap , " Mayor Hynes said . Meeting Slated Within 10 . days , he added , the auditorium commission , headed by Glenwood J. Sherrard , hotel operator , will meet with Prudential Insurance Company representatives to determine the city 's proportionate share of the center 's foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land the convention hall will occupy . At the ' same meeting Mayor Hynes expects the commission will name architects to prepare final plans for the convention hall . Already Hoyle , Doran &; Berry , associate architects for the entire Prudential Center , have been at work on preliminary plans , he said . The Mayor anticipates the commission will engage the same firm to produce final working plans . Opera Facilities ? The convention hall is to be located on a 21/2-acre section the present Boston &; Albany Railroad yards , close to the present Boston Technical High School , Although originally the land now occupied by the school was to be used in part for the auditorium , urgent need for the auditorium as fast as possible resulted in a change in plans . The Mayor said the school may not be relocated for two or more years and the city hopes to complete the auditorium within a year and a half . When the school is relocated the site will be used for parking , landscaping , and roadways . Mayor Hynes said he ' hopes construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it will be completed nine months later . However , he said , attaining that goal will depend upon conditions and elimination of delays . With future Metropolitan Opera seasons in Boston endangered by plans to tear down the Boston Opera House on Huntington Avenue , Mayor Hynes fervently hopes the new auditorium will include facilities for staging the opera season . The big stage required for opera productions will be costly , and considerable financial maneuvering will be required to fit such facilities in within the money limits available to the commission . " I want to do it , " the Mayor said . " The auditorium commission wants to do it and will do it if it is at all possible . " The Mayor foresees a longer annual Metropolitan Opera season in Boston , if the convention hall includes adequate opera facilities . The season could be two or three weeks instead of the present one , because the auditorium will seat 6,500 persons compared with 4,000 at the Opera House . he added . Exhibition Space , Too The auditorium commission , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been at work for some time . It already has had two or three preliminary meetings , the Mayor disclosed . Under the present plans the convention building will include 150,000 square feet of exhibition space in 11/2 stories as well as the auditorium itself . The Mayor believes the commission will have no trouble floating the 12-million-dollar bond issue within the 4 ' , per cent interest ceiling set by the legislation just passed by the Senate . In fact , he expects the bonds will sell at an interest rate of not more than 3% per cent in today 's bond market . The auditorium is an important part of the planned 100-million-dollar Prudential Center . The chief structure in the development . will be a 50-story building housing the company 's northern district offices . The site was purchased from.the Boston &; Albany Railroad . Along with development plans pending for the West End and the New York streets area in the South End , the Prudential Cen- ; ter is being counted on to give new vigor to the city 's over-all economy .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
