Did Romans wear false teeth ? Is Alaska bigger than Texas ? Will a turtle 's egg bounce ? <P> Radio 's Answer Man has been carefully answering such questions ( Yes to all three ) for the past 14 years . Started in Manhattan , where it is now heard twice daily ( 1:30 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. , Monday through Friday , WNBC ) , The Answer Man quickly spread across the nation , is now broadcast at varying times in 51 U.S. cities . <P> Questions pour in at the rate of 2,500 a day , and all of them-even those used on the air-are answered by mail . About 40% of the queries deal with local subjects or can be readily handled by thumbing through a standard reference book . The remaining , tougher 60% are forwarded to The Answer Man 's Manhattan headquarters , appropriately located across the street from New York City 's 5,000,000-volume Public Library , to be solved by 50-year-old Producer Bruce Chapman , his 40-man staff and a postal panel of 20,000 obliging experts , <P> Floating Beer Keg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) " Commons , " e.g. , " Do rattlesnakes always rattle before striking ? " ( No ) ; <P> 2 ) " Unusuals , " e.g. , " How many muscles in an elephant 's nose ? " ( 40,000 ) ; <P> 3 ) " Helpfuls , " e.g. , " Is drip coffee stronger if you pour the water through twice ? " ( No , weaker ) . <P> Some puzzlers can be answered only by experiment . Golfer Sam Snead obligingly proved that it is possible to drive a golf ball through a Providence-Pawtucket telephone book . An entomologist held a stop watch on a parasol ant , reported its rate of travel as 720 ft. an hour . Chapman , asked whether a wooden keg full of beer would float in sea water , dropped one into New York Harbor , found that it did - just barely . <P> Americans seem to have a consuming interest in snakes . They must be told repeatedly that there is no such thing as 1 ) a hoop snake , which is supposed to put its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2 ) a milk snake , which is supposed to sneak into barns and milk cows , or 3 ) a cannibal snake , which supposedly eats its young . Another bump of curiosity is excited by the Old Testament . Questioners want to know if Adam was divorced ( from Lilith , according to Jewish folklore ) ; whom Cain married ( possibly his sister Awan ) ; who was Noah 's wife ( probably Naamah ) . For no reason that Chapman and his associates can figure out , the most recurrent question is : " Do Indians have beards- ? " ( Yes ) . <P> L ' Homme Qui Saif . Last spring backed by EGA , The Answer Man crossed the Atlantic . He broadcasts to Great Britain over Radio Luxembourg ; in Germany as Der Antwortmann ; in France as L'Homme Qui Salt ; in Holland as De Antwoord-Man ; to Poland as Dr. Wszech-wiedzki . A surprising number of questions pour in from behind the Iron Curtain . Those not answered on the air are answered by letters sent in plain envelopes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cleared through the State Department .
