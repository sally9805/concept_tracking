txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : Mrs. Frances E. Bolton , able Congresswoman from Ohio and a Republican , estimates that there will be a deficit of nurses amounting to 49,000 by 1954 and she is pushing a bill for $47,000,000 in annual federal aid in the recruiting anti Mining of nurses . The powerful , ' 4 " . ve2l.tla &need; lobby of the American Ilatga . Association is fighting this , a .. 0 in crio , last session of Congress it successfully fought a bill to help provide us with more doctors . This campaign illustrates what a distinguished physician told me was the " paranoid " character of his colleagues ' opposition to what they call " socialized medicine . " It now appears that certain county medical societies , constituents of the American Medical Association , are worse than the national organization in that they are putting difficulties in the way of the most efficient conduct of the all-important blood drive on which General Marshall laid such eihphasis just before his resignation as Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time ago involving counties in New York and New Jersey . Finally , after difficulty , I won from officials of the Red Cross confirmation of the fact that in important cities their plans for central blood banks had been blocked largely by reason of the opposition of county medical societies . After the Second World War the Averican Medical . Association itself made difficulties about the Red Cross ' plans for carrying over into peacetime the fine work done in war . The Red Cross ' basic plan was that a donor of a pint of blood would be entitled to claim from the bank a pint of blood for himself or one of his immediate family in an emergency within the space of a year after his original gift . This plan is in effect in many places and at no time have the return demands exceeded 5 per cent , so that the Red Cross has a very large margin for war or disaster . The A. M. A. 's objections were finally removed by an agreement that the county medical societies in each case should approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come in . In some places existing arrangements were good enough so that there was no need of the blood banks . There is virtually no area in which it is impossible to give blood for the armed forces . But the best estimates of civilian and military needs are to the effect that if the supply is to be kept ample the number of donors must be increased , and that requires the best and most efficient means of collecting blood . The difference between the blood given by soldiers , for instance , at Fort Monmouth , N. J. , through the blood bank that it operates , and the blood given by civilians in Monmouth County , which has no such well-organized facilities , is impressive and stfggestive . In Newark , almost ever since the beginning , of the Korean war , that is for ; more than a year , there has been wrangling about a central bank . Objections have been such that now a bank will probably be opened in Plainfield . Need for Central Bank Nominally , the Essex County Medical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there already exists an Essex County Blood Bank . The Red Cross is aware of that fact and no one has urged the discontinuance of that particular bank . But it was felt that a central bank for a larger area , with particular reference to the needs of soldiers , should be opened , and this opening has been blocked at a time when the need for blood is great . The Red Cross officials also mentioned Dallas and Houston and Minneapolis in reply to my questions concerning places in which there had been difficulties with the county medical societies . I think the American public is entitled to these facts and to better explanations of the attitude of medical societies than it has had . By no means should reluctance of some county medical societies to set up efficient Red Cross blood banks be made a scapegoat to excuse our failure to give blood . NORMAN THOMAS . New York , Oct. 7 , 1951 . Aneurin Bevan 's Role Assessed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your Oct. .4 editorial on Bevan is , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to say that he and his friends won " four of the seven political seats on the National Executive " of the Socialist party might just possibly be misleading . They won four of the seven seats elected by the constituency parties , which leaves them in a heavy minority in an Executive of twenty-seven members . Twelve of the balance of twenty members are elected by the trade unions , whose leaders are strongly opposed to Mr. Bevan . The " fraternal " delegate of the unions to the conference , Sir William Lawther , took the opportunity to draw a comparison between " those who weave theories " and " the horny-handed trade unionists who keep the party in operation . " The trade unions are the main financial support of the Socialist party , and who pays the piper expects to call the tune . Finally , let me point out that conference disposes altogether of 6,192,000 votes . The constituency parties represent 1,147,000 of , these , while the trade union leaders control 4,987,000 . Mr. Bevan has a long way to go before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read with interest your editorial " Sanitation Slowdown , " particularly that portion which deals with just complaint against the city . ? ? The firemen of this city also have just complaint against the city . We have repeatedly brought to the attention of the city administration the appalling salary conditions of our members , only to receive the stock answer : " Where is the money to come from ? " We have shown where the city could raise enough for an immediate stopgap raise for firemen , only to be told that the problem is not one for firemen alone , but a general Civil Service problem requiring $100,000,000 . We are professional firemen charged with the responsibility of protecting life and property in the City of New York . We are not fiscal experts . The city administration is charged with the responsibility of giving consideration to the salary needs of its employes . We have tried to negotiate , to arbitrate ; we have asked that an impartial mediation and arbitration board be established  --  all to no avail . It becomes increasingly obvious that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritating due to the fact that the Mayor , the Budget Director , the members of the Board of Estimate , the City Councilmen , the Citizens Budget Commission , the newspaper editorials and the minority leader , Councilman Stanley Isaacs , are in agreement that firembn should be receiving higher salaries . However , the stock answer still is " there is no mpy in the budget for salaries . " This the face of the fact that since 1940 the cost of living index has risen 90 per cent , as compared to ? ? the salary raises of 47 per cent for our members . On Aug. 13 Robert Moses , as a member of the Mayor 's ' committee surveying Civil Service , released to the newspapers a report and a reply by Controller Lazarus Joseph , in which he outlines a $100,000,000 program of salary increases for Civil Service employes . Mr. Moses states that this should be an absolute minimum . The raises proposed by Mr. Moses do not begin to meet the high cost of living , but most certainly would serve to bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no recommendation has been made as to where or how this money is to be added to the budget . The firemen ask only for fair treatment . We require an immediate stopgap raise and a memorandum of agree-. ment for a raise to be included in the next budget . This action on the part of the city would certainly bolster the morale of the firemen . Unless something constructive is done soon the Uniformed Firemen 's Association can not be responsible for the actions of our members . ANTHONY J. TINT .

Appointment of German Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : An item appeared in THE TIDIES of Oct. 7 stating that " Dr. , Walter P. Schreiber , former German general who spent three and a half years as a prisoner in the Soviet Union , has joined the faculty of the United States Air Force School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field . " This news item states further that " during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science division of the German Wehrmacht " ( armed forces ) . According to your report , Dr. Schreiber , as chief of the Wehrmacht 's medical division , " served through the entire war " until captured by the Russians in Berlin . The fact that after being returned to East Germany in 1948 he " escaped into the American Zone " and *served as a ' surgeon " in a D , P. camp is no proof that he had opposed the unspeakable brutality of fellow-physicians at prison camps and extermination centers under Nazi rule . What were the Herr Doktor 's feelings about the heinous crimes of German medical scientists in the Second . World War ? MAURICE WINOGRAD . New York , Oct. 7 , 1951 . Monthly Income The statement that monthly income of families of four or five is 13,000 yen or $50 may be a typographical error , a as 13,000 yen is only $36.11 , This eor ? rected munificent sum is not the actual ' take-home pay , as there are deductions. consisting of withholding taxes , Social Security deductions and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not simply that of the family head , but may be the aggegate income of the household . The sum may include substandard wages derived from home work amounting to as little as 60 yen a day , or less than 17 cents . It may , include income derived from selling family possessions such as unseasonalg clothing or derived from black-marketing activity such as selling one ' rice ' ration and buying cheaper or more , bulky food . And it may include in- , come from other activities repugnant to Western culture . However , the Nippon Times and Mainichi have both deplored the rising venereal disease rates , , and have indicated that this is due in , some measure to the " sacrifices " that , some " beloved wives and daughters " make in endeavors to help support ' their families . While the income described and ana -- lyzed may be considered low by American standards , statistics on public ) assistance reveal that recipients receive , on the average , 600 yen per month , or $1.67 . For a family of ftYR : this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8.33 . This is considerably . less than the monthly earnings YOf 13,000 yen , or $36.11 , There are In Japan about two million persons re- ; ceiving public assistance in part or as K whole . These consist mostly of widows with small children , dependent children , the aged and diseased . Use of Milk Baths While I regret that I am unable to offer a solution for the difficulties pointed out , I am anxious to bring them to the attention of your readers . A prefectural welfare chief pointed out to me that I would be more shocked if I examined the income of people not on public assistance than I was shocked at the income of those receiving public assistance . Some of my spot checiis verified this . I do believe , however , that a country that has so . little food should use what little it does have as wisely as possible . Anyone knowing the public welfare situa. tion in Japan at first hand should look askance at the practice of milk baths at exclusive Turkish baths in Osaka , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program ? Why not also make less powdered milk for confectioners and bakers ? Malnutrition is a factor in tuberculosis and Japan haa. more than its share of this disease . By helping itself , Japan can win greater ' sympathy and cooperation from U. N. I. C. E. F , and other organizations functioning in the health and welfare field .

Arab Aggression Stated To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK Taos : I refer to the letter by B. S. Bowdish , published in your issue of Sept : , 29 , in which the statement is made that the Arabs were " forcibly driven " from their homelands , presumably in , Palestine , Although repeated at intervals dura ing the last three years , no amount of repetition of this charge can change HS inaccuracy and falsehood into truth . The Arabs were not forcibly driven . from their homes , but left them at the instigation of their own leaders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1948 , the local Arab : leaders were offered a truce with the Jews which provided that the Arabs should remain and continue their life normally , The Arab leaders refused to accept these terms , however , and chose instead to lead a mass evacuation of some 70,000 Arabs from Haifa . It should never , be forgotten in the discussion of this problem . that the Arab League nations attacked Israel . ' The purpose of their aggression waif : described by Azzam Pasha , the Seers. tary General of the Arab League , 111 the following statement which he made in Cairo on May 15 , 1948 : " This wilt be a war of extermination and a me. mentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and , the Crusades .

The mast of us know what America did fo- Is in the war and has done for us since , and know also that civilization and freedom and human dignity depend upon our partnership . May I add how deeply touched we have been by American genuine understanding of the character of our King and the sympathy shown in our days of anxiety for him . LORD WINSTER . London , England , Oct. 8 , 1951 , Increase Asked for Firemen Fair Treatment Urged , With a Stopgap Raise Granted Now Japan 's Food Problem Better Use of Any , Available Food SuPplies Is Advocated . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I read with sympathetic interest the report in THE TIMES of Oct. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Having returned only recently from Japan after a sojourn of almost three years , where I was em . ployed as a welfare official under the Civil Affairs Division of G. H. Q.-S . C. A. P. , I should like to make the following comments : School lunches are particularly essential for Japanese school children in view of the country 's limited food situation and the comparatively low incomes of the large families . Powdered milk is one of the school lunch items and was contributed by U. N. I. , C. E. F. ( United Nations International Children 's Emergency Fund ) to elementary schools and nurseries . Direct United States Arrily relief may also . have provided some of the items of the school lunches . In some instances it was the one nutritious meal that many school children were able to have and was free only to children whose fami- " , lies were recipients of public assist . ' ance . Liberty of the Press To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In this fair city of Boston , the cradle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Gazette , the earliest newspaper advocating American independence . Attempts to suppress its bold utterances called forth this declaration by the Massachusetts House of Representatives : " The liberty of the press is a great bulwark of the liberty of the people .
