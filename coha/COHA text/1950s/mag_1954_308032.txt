FOR nine years past , Ivan Le Lorraine Albright has been laboring over the same painting ( opposite ) . He hopes to finish it in another three . The painting more than justifies Albright 's dedication to it even now : it is at least as able as it is odd . The overworked word unique fits Albright 's accomplishment exactly . <P> The artist himself is a brisk , cheery little fellow of 57 bearing an amazing resemblance to the dwarf named Doc in Walt Disney 's Snow White . Like Doc , he is white-haired , baldpated , plump , restless and has a stammer . His sad brown eyes are partly hidden behind horn-rimmed spectacles . He laughs a lot . His art , of course , seems as out of this world as any hobgoblin 's . <P> Things Are Nothing . Albright paints in an old wooden house in a dreary down-at-the-heel section of Chicago . " I like this neighborhood . " he says . " I can think here . " An ingenious system of black window shades enables him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his still-life in turn . The still-life actually exists , whole , in his studio . Albright built the moldy brick wall himself , and assembled all the vast assortment junk that makes up the rest of the picture . The major items are on wheels , so that they can be shifted about the studio . But Albright does no more shifting than neccessary ; he lets things lie until richly coated with dust . He loves them chiefly for their melancholy aura of vanished life . " Things are nothing . " he says . " It 's what 's happened to them that matters . " <P> No fool-the-eye realist , Albright paints each object in the light most flattering to it . To paint the whole picture in a single light would make it " static , " he believes . Another Albright idea 5 to paint different objects at different angles . He will turn the canvas upside down to paint a bottle on a bureau , then turn it sidewise to paint the bureau . At first glance , everything in his pictures seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start spinning . <P> Results Are Something . Albright 's brushes are the smallest obtainable . For really fine work he uses one lateral spine of one chicken feather , tied to a handle for him by a man who specializes in tying fishermen 's flies . His first step , which may take years is to cover the canvas with a very detailed charcoal drawing . After fixing the charcoal with a spray , he begins applying thin glazes of oil color , sometimes spending weeks on a square inch . When I get sick to death of painting glass " he says " I paint wood for a while . Then when I get fed up with that'I 'll paint bricks . . . and so forth . " <P> When he gets sick of painting altogether . Albright taxies home to Chicago 's fashionable North Side ( his wife is Josephine Medill Patterson Reeve , daughter of the late founder of New York 's Daily News ) or goes off to his Wyoming ranch At such times of rest , Albright readily confesses that he does " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . with my eyes wide open . But I do like getting the results I want . I 'd rather paint one good picture than a hundred bad ones . Anybody can paint bad ones-including me. "
