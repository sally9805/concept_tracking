The real-estate lobby 's most energetic spokesman is a solemn-looking Midwesterner named Herbert U. Nelson . As the $25,000-a-year executive vice president of the National Association of Real Estate Boards , he once undertook to set the populace straight on the postwar housing shortage : there was no shortage at all , he said , just an " overconsumption of space . " He was also the first man alert enough to link that stalwart Ohio conservative , Bob Taft , with the Communists-because Taft sponsored a public housing bill . <P> Last week Nelson appeared as a witness in a House committee 's inquiry into Washington lobbies . He had barely started to testify when Pennsylvania Democrat Frank Buchanan , the committee chairman , pulled out a letter and asked whether Nelson had written it . He had . It was addressed to the 1949 president of his organization , and it said : <P> " I do not believe in democracy . I think it stinks . I believe in a republic operated by elected representatives who are permitted to do the job , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but direct taxpayers should be allowed to vote . I do n't believe women should be allowed to vote at all . Ever since they started , our public affairs have been in a worse mess than ever . . . " <P> The Real Estate Boards ' counsel leaped to his feet in protest : Nelson 's letter was a confidential communication which had nothing to do with the lobby investigation , and it had been pinched from the files when his outfit had been kind enough to let lobby investigators rummage through its records . But his protest was too late : one lobbyist 's effectiveness had been cut down to size .
