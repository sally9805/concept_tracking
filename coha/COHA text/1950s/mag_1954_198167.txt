A Bullet Is Waiting ( Welsch ; Columbia ) . In old-fashioned movies , when an innocent girl was trapped with two desperate men in a cabin miles from anywhere , the bad guy made his grab and wound up on a slab , while the good guy took the lady to the preacher . But times have changed . In this picture , for instance the cabin serves as a sort of alchemical vessel in which all the characters are essentially transformed . As a matter of fact after sitting in that cabin for about 85 minutes the moviegoer may never be the same again , either . <P> Rory Calhoun is a killer wanted in Utah . Stephen McNally is a deputy sheriff who is bringing him in . Lost in the California hills , they stop at Brian Aherne 's sheep farm . Brian is away , but Jean Simmons , his daughter , fills the office of host - and her blue jeans , too-very nicely ' Father taught at Oxford , " she informs her guests . Rory asks politely : " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickened m , Jean goes on , " and he came out find peace and isolation . " Then she reads to them from father 's works . <P> With the carrot of sex before and the lash of culture behind , the killer is soon trotting docilely down the straight and narrow . Even an unattractively moral collie , who obviously thinks he is more intelligent than anyone else in the picture ( and may be , at that ) , condescends to lick his hand . Moreover , Sheriff McNally -a character who has to be unpleasant on principle , since the scriptwriter forgot to give him any specific motivations-mellows a little , too , and in the end they all charge off to Utah together as cheerily as vestrymen to a box supper on the church lawn . " Great Britain and the State of Utah , " says Rory to Jean in a wobbly voice . " It 's impossible . " <P> Bengal Brigade ( Universal ) . The British laid down the white man 's burden in India seven years ago , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bengal Brigade is the second Hollywood picture this year to be concerned with the period of the great Sepoy Mutiny of 1856 . <P> As in King of the Khyber Rifles ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) , the hero ( Rock Hudson ) is a British officer , who in this case has a Midwestern twang to his speech . He affects to defect to the enemy , but only in order to diddle some secrets out of a raja ( Arnold Moss ) with a slight New York accent . Add to the linguistic confusion a Hindu girl ( Ursula Thiess ) who has a German accent , and even the children for whom the movie is intended may suspect that the action is not quite faithful to history . <P> On that score , moviegoers of all sorts and ages have the right to an honest gripe : movies about India might do well to be more faithful to history . The truth about the British raj* might make hearts pound - and turnstiles whir-far faster than they do at the conventional buncombe under the banyans.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
