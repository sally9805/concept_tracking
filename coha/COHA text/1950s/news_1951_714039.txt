txt Carran , Democrat of Nevada , the subcommittee chairman , later told reporters : " I do n't think we 'll cite him for contempt . He has enough troubles as it is . And the testimony he did give was even more incriminating than the responses to the questions he refused to answer . We got more out of him than we expected . " Although Field refused to answer many questions on the ground that if he did so he might incriminate himself , he did reply to all inquiries touching on what services he might have given to the Communists or what associations he might have had with them . Field , who described his present occupation , with a bleak smile , as that of " prisoner , " estimated that in a period of fifteen years he had contributed about $60,000 to the Institute of Pacific Relations . This organization is under inquiry by the subcommittee in its investigation to determine whether subzersive influences shaped American foreign policy in the Far East .

Leading Points Set Forth Among the principal points brought out in the interrogation of Mr. Carter and in correspondence produced by the subcommittee counsel , Robert Morris , from the institute 's seized files were the following : 1 . In 1940 , Philip C. Jessup , then Ian official of the institute and now a United States Ambassador-atLarge , had hoped to bring Field back to work for the institute once AT SENATE HEARING - swogow Frederick Vanderbilt Field testifying yesterday in Washington . The New York Times his new task was completed " he would return to the institute . " The chairman Dr. Jessup read a long telegram which he had received from Mr. Federick V. Field in Chicago on September first , " said the minutes of this meeting , " in which Mr. Field indicated that he had been called to the secretaryship of a new society which was being created to strengthen the forces of democracy . " Mr. Carter testified that both he and Dr. Jessup had told Field he was making a mistake that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Jessup was one of those attacked last year by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin , in his campaign to try to show Communist or pro-Communist infiltration of the State Department . The Ambassador and all others accused were cleared by the Democratic majority of a Senate investigating committee . Among these was Mr. Lattimore , whom Senator McCarthy called " the top Soviet agent " in the United States . The four Chinese concerns that Field acknowledged having served as agent were the Bank of China , the China National Aviation Corporation and two Chinese postal and savings banks . He agreed that the majority control was in the Peoples Republic of China , the Communist regime . He disputed , however , that these enterprises could be considered as inseparable from the Chinese Communist Government itself . Never mentioning directly the Chinese Communist intervention in Korea last November , except in a phrase about " international developments , " he nevertheless testified that it was in November that he began the process of cutting loose as American agent . This was completed in last December . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lattimore and Mr. Currie , all asa t t he had completed a task with the American Peace Mobilization . This latter organization , while the Hitler-Stalin pact was in force and Britain was standing almost alone against the Nazis , followed the Soviet line that the British and Germans were simply two sets of " imperialists. " 2 . In 1938 , Earl Browder , then head of the Communist party in the United States , was recommended by Mr. Carter to a Canadian friend , as a speaker and  --  a " one hundred per cent American . " 3 . In June , 1941 , during the life of the Hitler-Stalin pact and just before the Nazis broke it by attacking Russia , Mr. Carter had a " most illuminating " two-hour luncheon here with Constantine Oumansky , one-time Soviet Ambassador here . 4 . Prof. Owen Lattimore had been at that luncheon , and Mr. Carter , in a later note to Mr. Lattimore , had regretted that a then army colonel , later a brigadier general , Philip Faymonville , had not been present . Hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been associated with the institute , had expressed admiration for " the incisive mind " of Ludwig Rajchman , who later became an official of Communist Poland , and believed it might be well for him to participate in an institute conference in Canada . Hiss , convicted of perjury in denying giving aid to Communist espionage , is serving a prison term . It was shown that Mr. Carter invited Mr. Rajchman to take part , but later found that there would be difficulties in his re-entry to this country and dropped the project . Mr. Carter then asked a subordinate to pass this information " on informally and orally to Hiss. " 6 . Mr. Carter , by two telegrams and a letter to a Washington employe of the institute , had sought to put a correspondent for the Soviet news agency Tass in touch with Hiss , who then was in the State Department , and with Lauchlin Currie , then an aide to President Franklin Roosevelt . It also was brought out , however , that Mr. Carter had suggested that the correspondent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judd , Republican of Minnesota , and J. William Fulbright , now a Democratic Senator from Arkansas and then a Representative . 7 . Hiss had told Mr. Carter 's Washington agent , Rose Yardumian , that he " could not make the first advance in arranging a private talk with Rogoff " with the then head of the State Department 's Far East Division , Stanley Hornbeck. 8 . Mr. Rogoff instead had a talk with Mr. Lattimore , John Carter Vincent , a State Department career man , and Carl Remer , then a Government official and , now a professor at the University of Michigan . Mr. Morris produced records to show that by 1950 Miss Yardumian , the intermediary in these matters , was writing for Communist publications in Communistcontrolled China . Lamont Refused to Sign 9 . In June , 1945 , Mr. Carter and Professor Lattimore had tried to get Thomas W. Lamont , the Morgan banking house partner , to sign a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES that they had prepared . Mr. Lamont immediately refused . The letter was intended , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kai-shek articles by Max Eastman in The Reader 's Digest . It was shown that in the course of the negotiations , Mr. Carter tried to obtain the help of Mr. Lamont 's son , Corliss Lamont , and that in writing to Professor Lattimore he never referred to the younger Lamont with any other term than " the son . " It also was shown that Mr. Carter suggested to Professor Lattimore that in his draft of the proposed letter he should make certain changes so that no one could say that " even Lattimore admits that Manchuria is to become a part of the Soviet Union . " 10 . In February , 1947 , Mr. Carter had written to Hiss that " yesterday , at your suggestion , I had delightful talk with Robert T. Miller , whom I hope to see again . " Mr. Morris put into the record a statement that Elizabeth Bentley , an admitted former courier for Communist espionage agents , had estified in 1948 to the House Committee on Un-American Activities hat Miller was a Communist and nvolved in espionage .
