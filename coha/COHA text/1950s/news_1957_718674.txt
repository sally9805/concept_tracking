txt The- action of the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday in approving , without a dissenting vote , President Eisenhower 's nomination of Brig . Gen. Ralph W. Zwicker to the temporary rank of major general is only the most recent indication of the contempt in which one Joseph R. McCarthy is rightly held by his colleagues . It was at Senator McCarthy 's spiteful insistence that General Zwicker 's promotion has been held up since January  --  incidentally delaying some sixty other promotions on the same list . Senator McCarthy has never dropped his feud with General Zwicker over the famous Peress case , which preceded and in part led to the Army-McCarthy hearings that rocked the country just three short years ago . Now the Armed Services Committee has heard Mr. McCarthy 's reiteration of charges of perjury against General Zwicker , and in two days of questioning has heard the general himself . ? Yesterday 's vote of twelve to nothing , with two Senators not voting and one absent , has demonstrated to the Senate and to the world at large how much substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations . Other recent incidents tend to demonstrate the same thing . After Williarii Joseph Brennan Jr . had been nominated to be associate justice of the Supreme Court , he was subjected by Senator McCarthy to a disgraceful series of questions which should never have been allowed , arid which , incidentally , Mr. Brennan did not distinguish himself in answering . Mr. McCarthy accused Mr. Brennan on the Senate floor of conducting " guerrilla warfare " against Congressional investigations of communism ; but when the vote came Mr. Brennan received unanimous approval from the Senate , with the sole and audible exception of Mr. McCarthy . Again Mr. McCarthy 's colleagues showed what they thought of his views when they confirmed James D. Zellerbach as Ambassador to Italy a few weeks ago over Mr. McCarthy 's lonely protests . There can be no doubt that Mr. McCarthy 's influence remains nil , as it has been virtually since the . Senate 's vote of censure on Dec. 2 , 1954 . The decline of Mr. McCarthy is indicative of  --  and coincidental with  --  the gradual return of equilibrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . The greatest strength of this democracy is its common sense ; and common sense took a fearful beating when Mr : McCarthy was riding high . The exaggerated fears of internal subversion and betrayal , fed and fanned by demagoguery , played havoc in weakening our country in the face of a genuine threat from Communist Russia . But since 1954 the fears have been brought increasingly under control ; and reason is returning . An intelligent balance between- the real needs of national security and those ' of constitutional rights and individual liberties is once again being achieved . The courts , which by and large have been a citadel of freedom , , have played an indispensable part in this process . But it takes a long time for specific issues to be adjudicated in the courts ; and meanwhile much unnecessary damage may be and has been done . This is particularly so in the area of Government security cases . As the latest annual report of . the American Civil Liberties Union points out , there has indeed been great progress , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is always unfinished business , " and this truth ' should eliminate any trace of complacency . For example , the whole area of Negro civil rights , of segregation , of equality of opportunity , is in a state of ferment ; and , although a beginning , has been made , the road ahead is long and difficult . In other phases of civil liberty , particularly in respect to the First Amendment , the course of law and judicial opinion is still obscure . Despite some excellent court decisions , the internal security program as it affects both Federal and private employes needs greater clarification and liberalization . So do the regulations affecting such matters as passports and censorship . There is plenty to do and there is plenty of injustice to be undone ; but the outlook and the atmosphere are more encouragingly in tune than they were a few years ago with the ideas of liberal democracy that America has stood for throughout most of its history .                 @ @ @ @
