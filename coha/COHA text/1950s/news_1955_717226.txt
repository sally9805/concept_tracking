txt The House of Representatives passed today a bill to liberalize social security benefits for women and disabled persons . The bill also would admit more than 200,000 self-employed professional persons to the program . The House approved a 25 per cent rise in employer-employe contribution taxes to foot the bill . The vote was 372 to 31 , with Republicans jumping unhappily on the bandwagon . Twenty-three of the 203 Republicans , and eight of the 232 Democrats said " No . " It was a Democrats ' measure , put through the House Ways and Means Committee and taken to the floor under rigid restrictions . Only forty minutes of debate was permitted . No amendments could be offered . It required a two-thirds majority for passage . This was attained easily . It was not a bill that members of any political party could vote against without probably finding trouble within their constituencies . The measure now goes to the Senate . It was doubted that it could get through the Senate before Congress adjourned its first session . There was a possibility that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provisions The bill provides for these programs : CA reduction of the age eligibility of women for Social Security benefits from 65 to 62 years . ' Monthly benefits for disabled insured individuals at the age of 50 . ' Continued monthly benefits for disabled children after they attain the age of 18. 41An expansion of Old-Age and Survivors ' Insurance to cover self-employed professionals including lawyers , dentists , osteopaths , chiropractors , veterinarians , naturopaths and optometrists . Physicians would remain excluded . This expansion also would in- ' elude some 20,000 turpentine and gum workers at naval stores , and 13,000 employes of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Federal Home Loan Banks . Admitted , too , would be those qualified under sharefarming arrangements ? " sharecroppers , renters , tenants and lessees . " Republicans denounced the measure as dangerous to the whole Social Security program . It was a bill , they contended , born in politics and " crammed down the throat of the House " by " preposterous ' and " rotten " tactics . House Republican leaders , headed by Representative Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rank and file of the party to vote " aye " as the roll was called . Republicans , in justifying the votes they cast in favor of a measure they had denounced , expressed hope that the Senate , with its unlimited debating power , would compose a " better and safer " bill . Senate action appeared to be far away . This measure , the Republicans held , was written in " star chamber sessions . " They said it disregarded the impacts on the whole Social Security program resulting from the billions of dollars of cost it would build up , with its strain on the Social Security fund . Increases in the present schedule of contributions would , be one-half of one per cent each on employers and employes , and three-fourths per cent on the self-employed . Tax Rises Charted To finance the multi-billion dollar program Republicans contended , the payroll tax , now 2 per cent each from employers and employes , would have to be raised almost immediately to 23 ; per cent . They emphasized that each of the periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined tax on employer and employe to 9 per cent-432 per cent each . The levy on the self-employed , they added , would rise to 6% per cent by that time . Representative Jere Cooper , the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Ways and Means panel , told the House that these new benefits were " sorely needed . " Women , he said , as an example , usually run three or more years behind their husbands in age . The proposed earlier eligibility of wives , he emphasized , would prevent a necessity for both husband and wife to exist on the benefits of the husband alone while the wife waits to reach the age of 65 . Totally disabled individuals , Mr. Cooper added , should not have to wait until the age of 65 before benefits start . Nor , he argued , should benefits for a disabled child be cut off at the age of 18 , when the family responsibility might be increased instead of diminished .                  @ @ @
