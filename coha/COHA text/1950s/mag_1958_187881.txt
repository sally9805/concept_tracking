BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED ( 147 pp. ) - Aldous Huxley-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> To the Space Age , Aldous Huxley , one of its prophets , has sent a message : " Have second thoughts , will not travel . " <P> It is barely more than a quarter of a century since Huxley had a vile vision of mankind 's future , in which a scientific power elite of cads presided over a proletariat of test-tube-bred sub-morons kept happy on a tranquilizer called soma . The elite could dispose of heretics by sending them to exile in rockets . Huxley lived to see the title of his book , Brave New World , pass into common language as a wry cliche . Now he argues that his nightmare is becoming a waking reality . Looking about today , Utopiarist Huxley is appalled to find how obediently the world has grown to his fictional clippers . Why this is hell , he says with Marlowe 's Mephistophilis , nor are we out of it ! <P> With the strangled sincerity of a man who would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Huxley says it is . <P> Singing Theologicals . In this verbally sparkling but essentially dismal exercise in self-vindication and world indictment , Huxley has assembled a mass of evidence to suggest that the human race is approaching his dread vision of total togetherness much more quickly than he estimated . ( Huxley set the time of his soma-happy society in the 7th century A.F. , or After Ford . ) Institutes for Motivational Research , hidden persuaders and singing commercials make Huxley think man is being nudged closer to the dark side of the moonstruck world he once described . <P> His other examples range from brainwashing techniques of the Chinese Communists to the more beneficent therapies of a Californian penal system . In Brave New World Huxley had his director of Hatcheries and Conditioning use a technique called hypnopaedia , by which subjects got moral training during sleep . In 1957 the warden of the Woodland Road Camp of Tulare County , Calif , was doing just that . With pillow loudspeakers , the warden was able to reach certain delinquents in their sleep , and from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The black arts of hypnosis , subliminal commercials and so on are becoming an accepted part of the machinery of civilization . To Huxley , even a hymn is a " Singing Theological . " <P> As for the advantages of man 's mastery of space , Huxley has this to say : " All our exuberant post-Sputnik talk is irrelevant and even nonsensical . So far as the masses of mankind are concerned , the coming time will not be the Space Age ; it will be the Age of Over-population . " In a parody of the old song , Huxley asks : <P> Will the space you 're so rich in Light a fire in the kitchen , Or the little god of space turn the Spit , spit , spit ?
