" Time for jazz , " says the deep voice carefully . " Time for jazz , " echo tens of thousands of loudspeakers around the world , as the strains of Duke Ellington 's Take the A Train die into the background . For the next hour , seven nights a week , 52 weeks a year , the world 's most widely heard disk-jockey program has the attention of listeners in 80-odd countries . It is the second and more popular portion of Music U.S.A. ( the first half is pop tunes ) , the Voice of America 's only regular music program . The words come from Disk Jockey Willis Conover ; the music comes from all over America . <P> A typical show , recorded on tape in Washington to broadcast from ten Voice stations a month later , includes such diverse items as Count Basie 's swinging Straight Life , Joe Newman 's Midgets , Charlie Parker 's Air Conditioning , the Modern Jazz Quartet 's Django , oldtime Trumpeter Papa Celestin 's When the Saints Go Marching In , legendary Cornetist Bix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number called I 'm All Bound ' Round with the Mason Dixon Line , by the day 's interviewee , Dixieland Trumpeter Jimmy McPartland . Between numbers , Conover quietly and succinctly tells about the next record or gently nudges his guest to talk about his life and times . " While they 're learning to admire Americans as performers , listeners around the world are learning to admire America , " says Conover . The show almost never tries to peddle overt pro-American or anti-Communist propaganda , is put together in the belief that " jazz is its own propaganda . " <P> Not the Legs . The Voice was almost totally tone-deaf until two years ago ; officials doubted the propaganda value of music . But it had at least a couple of staffers who were jazz buffs . Program Manager Eugene King and his deputy , John Wiggin , eventually made the point that , like it or not , jazz is a valuable exportable U.S. commodity . To sweeten its sometimes pungent flavor , the Voice decided to introduce the jazz with an hour of good pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , selected Buffalo-born Disk Jockey Conover , 35 . His qualifications : a pleasantly resonant voice , the ability to speak slowly enough to be understood by foreigners with a little English , and an intimate knowledge of jazz ; he owns a phenomenal 40,000 records , and draws from his collections for the Voice show . In most parts of the world , jazz is a kind of Esperanto to the young generation from 15 to 25 , and even countries with boiling anti-American prejudices enjoy and respond to it . In Communist-dominated centers , jazz was a more or less secret pleasure for years - the commissars labeled it capitalist depravity-but it is now permitted openly and apparently without prejudice . <P> No Poison . Music U.S.A. has only a handful of taboos : no " physically suggestive " lyrics ; nothing that might be racially offensive ( Conover never identifies his Negro performers as such ) , and absolutely no rock ' n ' roll . Says Conover : " I see no reason to poison the ears of overseas listeners . " <P>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
