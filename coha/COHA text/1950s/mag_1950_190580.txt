You saw the map on this page in TIME 'S issue of July 24 . That was the end of the third week of war in Korea . U.S. troops were still falling back . Their defense position was breached ; on the south bank of the Kum River they were threatened with envelopment from the flanks . It was obvious that they would have to pull out of the salient around Taejon and continue to fight a long delaying action . How far would they have to retreat before they were strong enough to make a comeback against the North Koreans ? <P> TIME 'S editors attempted to answer that question with a map ( herewith reprinted ) . It shows the week 's combat zone , and the zone that U.S. troops would have to fall back to in order to hold off the enemy . The perimeter of this " Comeback Zone , " as it turned out , was almost exactly the same as the line of the beachhead subsequently held by U.S. &; U.N . troops . The beachhead covered the maximum area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean troops could hold . <P> In a story accompanying the map the editors explained that it looked now like a three-phase war . The first phase was to fight a delaying action toward Pusan and establish a perimeter around this excellent port with both flanks resting on the sea . U.S. &; U.N . forces , with control of the air and sea , ought to be able to hold such a protected beachhead indefinitely . The second phase was to build up U.S. strength inside the perimeter . The third phase , as outlined by the editors , was the break out from the Pusan perimeter supported by Allied amphibious attacks behind the North Korean lines . <P> Two months later the assault on Inchon bore out the editors ' mid-July estimate of the situation and kicked off the third phase of the war . <P> <P> A five-man team of TIME Inc. reporters and photographers covered Operation Chromite at Inchon . Like most other newsmen , they had a tough time of it . Correspondent James Bell , who went in with the third assault wave on Inchon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked up in a jeep accident ( see PRESS ) and is now in a Tokyo hospital . Tokyo Bureau Chief Frank Gibney , one of the first four U.S. correspondents to hit the beach at Wolmi Island with the marines , went along with them across the Han River and into Seoul before returning to Tokyo to file copy for this week 's issue . Gibney , who was injured in a Han River bridge explosion on the fourth day of the war , has been ordered home for a well-earned rest . <P> As this issue of TIME went to press , **26;7430;TOOLONG Carl Mydans , who had accompanied General MacArthur during the first stages of the Inchon operation , was with the marines on the outskirts of Seoul-as were LIFE Photographers David Duncan and Hank Walker . Duncan missed the Inchon landing when the bombers of the Far Eastern Air Forces , which he had planned to cover , were grounded by bad weather . Walker almost missed it , too , when his landing craft was rammed and nearly sunk by a South Korean gunboat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staff writer Dwight Martin , who was a TIME correspondent in Shanghai , Formosa and Hong Kong in 1948-49 , has moved up to the Seoul front . And Hugh Moffett , National Affairs editor of LIFE and a former TIME Inc . Chicago bureau head , is on his way to take over Gibney 's job as Tokyo bureau chief . <P> Cordially yours ,
