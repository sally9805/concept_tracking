A man who has just been elected governor of a state as large as Pennsylvania can be expected to show elation , at least in private . But David Leo Lawrence , the governor-elect of Pennsylvania , wasted no time on celebration the morning after his election last fall . Just before three A.M. , a photographer asked him for " one more " victory picture . A thin edge of frost showed in Lawrence 's pale-blue eyes . " Come back in four years , " he said . " Then we 'll see how many victory pictures you 'll be taking . " Lawrence , probably the toughest old professional in the Democratic Party , has little use for pointless ritual or gestures of public sentiment . On that early November morning Last year , he was thinking not of yesterday 's victory but of battles yet to he fought as governor . He had got in by a winning margin of only 76,000 votes  --  a tough fight . And the next four years might be tougher . The photographers found Lawrence where he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , sitting in the same cramped county headquarters , at the same battered desk . He was coldly composed , a stocky , lion-headed figure wearing a dark-gray suit and the politician 's blue-for-television shirt . He had put on these clothes at eight A.M. the day before . Nineteen hours later the suit was unrumpled , the shirt showed no signs of wilt , and his thinning white hair lay in perfect order . If there was a film of sweat on his forehead , the television lights were to blame , not inner tension . But the characteristic Lawrence gesture  --  rhythmic finger drumming on the desk top , punctuated with slaps on the wood  --  was sharp and clear . Those who knew him recognized it as a sign . Lawrence , in the habit of a lifetime , was keeping his own counsel while he assessed what lay ahead . David Lawrence has survived fifty-four years in the sometimes brutal arena of politics . He knows it at every level , from work in the wards to the closed-door meetings where Presidential nominees are chosen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . Lawrence himself is author of the statement that " in Pennsylvania we 've been lax as hell . We 've let our coal industries run down . We 've sat by while our natural resources faded out . We 've let other states raid us for our factories and plants . We 've let slums challenge the very existence of some of our areas . Almost everywhere you look you can see the problems that face the governor of Pennsylvania . " Problems , of course , are not found only in Pennsylvania . Around the nation there are other governors of big states who also face hard decisions  --  a ( Cominunl from Pop : 75 ) The entire receipts after taxes  --  some S I 0.12 I .4D  --  were turned over to me . The new owners of the Royals , headed by Thomas E. Wood , did n't deduct a penny for their expenses and neither did the three visiting teams  --  the St. Louis Hawks , the Boston Celtics and the Detroit Pistons . As t explained earlier , money is no serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalized , my food , clothing and shelter are all included in the hospital expenses being paid for by Ohio workmen 's compensation . However , as Jack Twyman , who is looking after my affairs as my legal guardian , has foreseen , when I leave the hospital I will have all of my personal expenses to pay , plus some extra services that l will have to buy . These things may eat up my funds before I begin to support myself again . How 1 hope that it wo n't be very long after 1 get out of here before I 'm strong ? enough to go back with the Royals ! They have had their troubles in the N.B.A. this Rockefeller in New York , a Brown in California , a Williams in Michigan , a Meyner in New Jersey . But there is a difference between them and Lawrence of Pennsylvania . These men know that what happens to them in the next eighteen months will affect their chances of running for the Presidency in 1960 . Lawrence , at sixty-nine , is driven by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a future President ( " He outvoted Al Smith in New York , and that 's a vote-getter " ) , Lawrence has enjoyed the political power reserved for those who pick the men to live in the White House . Lawrence is at home with that power ; he does not plan to lose it . Success as a governor can only emphasize that he is a key force , without whose help it would be difficult for any man to get his party 's nomination for the Presidency . The jockeying to become the Democrats ' big hope in 1960 has already begun , and Lawrence , a veteran of twelve national conventions , is well able to assess the ploys , the claims and the maneuvers of would-be candidates . But in Lawrence 's eyes the man to watch is the only one who has said he is not a candidate for the nomination  --  but has stopped short of saying he would n't take it , if offered . The man 's name : Adlai Stevenson . " In Stevenson , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either party . But  --  and it 's a big ' but ' ? he 's been defeated twice . And that 's a hard thing to overcome . " Past defeats , however , do not take Stevenson out of the picture . Lawrence says , " We will have to wait and see how the sentiment goes . Many people are coming around to his way of thinking . He , remember , was the first to say that atomic tests should be ended . Things such as this are in his favor . As the convention comes near , we 'll have to decide whether the handicap of two defeats by Eisenhower is fatal . " Lawrence does not rule out Massachusetts ' Sen. John Kennedy , his party 's charm boy . But Kennedy is a Roman Catholic . Lawrence , being of the same faith himself , knows from experience the problems of a Catholic running for office in a dominantly Protestant state . " I did not know how much in this day and age people could think about religion in politics when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along in January . I believe I could help them . Basketball has been the biggest thing in my life since I was a little boy . It was responsible for my getting a college education . Ten colleges offered mc scholarships , I 'm glad I chose St. Francis . have n't forgotten my years there , and the school has n't forgotten inc . My fraternity brothers at Tau Kappa Epsilon have been pulling for me . The Franciscan fathers have said prayers for me and sent me Mass cards and scapulars . Coach W. T. Hughes and the entire St. Francis basketball squad visited me at the hospital twice when they were in Cincinnati to play Xavier last month . It was Coach Hughes and my high-school coach , Willard Fisher , who did the most to teach me basketball . I 'm grateful to every single person I 've named in this article , and to many others I have n't mentioned . There 's Father Scanlon , of Holy Name , who comes to fore the voters . Look at 1958 . Pat Brown won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were voting against the Republicans and the right-to-work law . They never thought about his Catholicism . The same thing was true of Mike DiSalle ( now governor of Ohio ) . He , too , had the big issue of the right-to-work law , so nobody thought about his religion . In my state we had no great issue ; we won by only 76,000 . When think of a national campaign I 'm sure a Catholic running for the Presidency must have an issue so big , to strong , so completely overriding that his religion is never thought of . It 's got to be bigger than vicuna coats , Oriental rugs or a golf-playing President . It 's got to be something that touches the people 's hearts  --  an appeal to their passions . " To Lawrence , the ability to touch men 's hearts and their passions is essential to the politician  --  no matter what his religion . If Lawrence has decided that the Democrats have such a man for 1960 , he 's told no one . One of his closest associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both the capitcil and the governor 's mansion  --  has said : " Dave has given me no indication whom he 'll back for the Democratic nomination in 1960 . But I do n't expect hint to say anything to me  --  or to anyone else  --  until he feels its the right moment , the moment of big drama . Truly is he a practical man . He would never back a candidate who would not make the big race  --  either because it was not his year or because suddenly there was the mistake that ruled hint out . In my own mind , however , I believe that Dave has made personal winter book on a candidate . " If this is so , Lawrence has given no public indication of it . He says the Democratic Party has a " number of high-level statesmen " ? in which rank he includes Kennedy . Lawrence , however , places only Stevenson at the very top  --  an opinion lie 's held for some time . In 1952 , despite word from the White House that Harry Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Lawrence was in the vanguard of those who pushed Stevenson into the nomination . In 1956 he was again one of the principals in Stevenson 's nomination . Moreover , it was his voice that tipped the scales in favor of the extraordinary decision to let the convention delegates see Me and pray with me at Christ Hospital ; Bill Nettles , my barber before I got sick , who keeps on cutting my hair out of friendship ; my buddy , Winston Brown , who does so many personal things for me ; my cousin , Jane , in Cincinnati , and Mrs. Hicks , my aunt in Montclair , New Jersey . Then there arc all the professional baseball and basketball men who have visited me when they were in town . I wish there were room to list every . body I 'd like to thank . That includes the more than 5000 warmhearted strangers who have written me get-well letters . I intend to answer them all just as soon as I can . Some of these good people have even enclosed money  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to read sympathetic letters from people who had the same sort of trouble as mine . Generally their progress was slower than mine has been , but they recovered completely . 1 know I can do it too . I 'm only twenty-five years old . I 've got a lot of living ahead of me. choose the Vice-Presidential nominee without dictation from Stevenson . The circumstances of that decision show the character and persuasiveness of Lawrence in national politics . It was reached at a meeting in Chicago 's Stock Yard Inn , only thirty minutes after the convention had nominated Stevenson . The meeting began with four men : Stevenson and his campaign manager , the late James A. Finnegan , of Philadelphia ; Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn , and the Democrats ' majority leader in the Senate , Texas ' Lyndon Johnson . By then it was obvious that a real move was under way to get the Vice-Presidential nomination for Sen. Estes Kefauver ; it is said Johnson and Rayburn wanted Stevenson to name Senator Kennedy as his running mate . Finnegan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , to let the delegates choose whom they would . The meeting was stalled . Finnegan , who had gone to work for Stevenson with Lawrence 's encouragement , went to Lawrence to ask his help . " I do n't think I can handle those fellows , " he said , referring to Rayburn and Johnson . Lawrence joined the meeting . What Lawrence said was never recorded , but he recalls the gist as something like this : " Anyone running against Eisenhower has an almost impossible job to win . In 1952 the Southerners dictated the choice of Senator John Sparkman of Alabama for the Vice-Presidential nomination . And it was done in the old back-room tradition . This time we should do something new . It would be dramatic to have the convention pick the man . " Lawrence 's word carried , and Stevenson threw the Vice-Presidential contest open . Kefauver won , and a key element in his victory was Lawrence 's politicking . Not until later  --  much later  --  was it disclosed that Lawrence had a hand in Kefauver 's earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence promised that if Kefauver withdrew from the fight he would have Lawrence 's support for the Vice-Presidential spot . The man who could organize a deal like that qualifies as a wise old pro ; observers , looking back on Lawrence 's career , are tempted to mistake him for an old-fashioned big-city boss . Indeed , the facts might seem to justify such an opinion . Lawrence 's father was a precinct leader MI held a county job in Pittsburgh . Law , arice came from a poor neighborhood , and took a two-year commercial course astead of completing high school . His list job  --  at fourteen  --  was with William ? , Brennen , the Democratic boss of Patsangh , He sat in on political meetings ; he istened and he learned . Equipped with a ' ad for polities , he rose from ward worker o county cha innan to state cha rma n . He married a local girl , had a family of five ; iwo boys , however , died in an automobile accident . Yet the public 's picture of him was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was in his office every weekday and every Sunday afternoon . For years he was the man who picked the man to run for public office in Pennsylvania  --  not the man who ran himself . The political pattern is familiar , but it does n't entirely explain Lawrence of Pennsylvania . He does n't operate like the old-time bosses  --  Curley of Boston , or Hague of Jersey City , or Kelly of Chicago . Lawrence knows that the first rule of politics is survival , and that the politician who does n't move with the times is doomed . The genius of Lawrence  --  and the word is not lightly used  --  is his quick understanding of issues that touch the minds and hearts of men . In 1932 , when Roosevelt came to Pittsburgh for a campaign speech . Lawrence 's friends advised using a small hall because it would be easy to fill . Instead he rented Forbes Field  --  capacity , 30,000 ? and packed it . His reason : " It was a depression year . The people wanted to feel hope . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new deal with security for all . " That same insight gave him his issue in 1945 , when he was elected to the first of his four terms as mayor of Pittsburgh . The issue ? Reviving a sick city . " The smoke was ruining us , " Lawrence says . Our industries were pulling out . I knew we had to put the P for Pride back in Pittsburgh . " And with this campaign he won the support of Democrats and Republicans alike . Today Pittsburgh is a city reborn , perhaps the nation 's finest example of postwar recovery . The pride is back . Industries have stopped moving out ; instead they are expanding at home . Rivers have been spanned and mountains tunneled through . New housing is everywhere : the Golden Triangle , where the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers come to feed the Ohio gleams with new office buildings of stone and steel , glass and aluminum . Last year , when Lawrence ran for governor , the three Pittsburgh newspapers  --  all of them independent  --  endorsed him . The common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had done for Pittsburgh . There are only a few who believe the work in Pittsburgh could have been done without Lawrence ; Lawrence would be the last to say he could have done it alone . While campaigning for governor on the Democratic ticket he said again and again that in Pittsburgh he had had the co-operation of the biggest Republican industnalists  --  men such as financier Richard King Mellon and president Clifford Hood of the United States Steel Corporation . As he points out , he had the support of labor unions too . " We were all together , " he has said , " and without that ' all ' there would have been nothing . " An old-time boss would n't have been so generous in sharing the credit . But the old bosses are gone ; Lawrence has survived . Along his way he has set some records . He is the first Roman Catholic elected governor of Pennsylvania . He is the oldest man to win the governor 's chair . So far as Pennsylvania records show , he is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political practices and go on to be elected governor . Those trials took place twenty years ago , in the backwash of Pennsylvania 's first Democratic administration in forty years , when George H. Earle was governor . In Earle 's time , 1935-38 , Lawrence held office as Secretary of the Commonwealth , functioning unofficially as Earle 's closest adviser . In 1938 , when the Democrats quarreled bitterly over who would he the organization 's next choice for governor , Lawrence was savagely attacked . Running in the primary as an independent candidate , the late Charles J. Margican , a onetime Republican who had served as Earle 's attorney general , accused Lawrence of bribery and of mating state workers for campaign funds . Lawrence 's wing of the Democratic Party was attacked also by United States Sen. Joseph Guffey , who for years in the party had been his close friend . Lawrence , denying all charges , answered in kind . It was , as President Roosevelt put it , a " latter-day Dante 's Inferno . " When the votes were counted , the Lawrence-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked . That fall the Republicans won . Meanwhile , the G.O.P. had been paying careful attention to Margiotti 's charges against Lawrence . A Republican district attorney opened grand-jury investigations that led to indictments and two trials . In the first trial , a jury acquitted Lawrence of charges that he had 11 ) extorted 5000 from a contractor in what the state called blackmail ; ( 2 ) conspired to " cheat and defraud the Commonwealth " on road-building material and ( 3 ) helped to give a contractor preferential treatment on state bids . In the second trial , another jury acquitted him of charges that he conspired to " assess the public payroll for political contributions " ? mating . By that time Lawrence was back tending his Pittsburgh insurance business . He was still Democratic state chairman , but there was only the wreckage to control . Under the circumstances , an ordinary man might let bygones be bygones . Not Lawrence . When the announcement came that he had been cleared of the mating charge , Lawrence said , " For the second time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calumny and lies spread against the Earle Administration in the 1938 primary by the Margiottis and the Guffeys and their slimy speech writers and press agents .... This complete vindication of both the Earle Administration , my associates and myself makes me very happy .... " And Lawrence said this , even though Guffey in one of the trials had appeared as a character witness for him . Lawrence forgets neither friend nor foe . Last fall Lawrence refused all invitations to speak at public functions for a week after his election . According to one of his friends , there was a good reason . " Dave , " says the friend , " did n't want people coming up and fussing over him . He knew that there 'd be a lot of congratulations and ' we-knew-you'd-win ' talk . It 's not that he was n't grateful to those who helped him get elected  --  it 's just that he is n't a man who wants people to fawn over him . " Some politicians affect this plain-manof-the-people routine when there are important people around to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign trip from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh last fall , he took a cab from his hotel to the airport , alone , He went into the cafeteria and drank a cup of coffee , alone . And he boarded the airplane alone  --  just one of thirty-odd passengers . He opened his newspapers and read them . And when the plane landed in Pittsburgh , he left for his city-hall office accompanied by no one except the driver of his automobile  --  a 1950 model with a hole that 's been worn through the floor of its trunk . That hole is nothing to Lawrence . What 's important to him is , " That car 's in good running condition . " That night he had to speak at a political rally thirty miles out of Pittsburgh . He left his office at six P.M. , still wearing the brown suit and striped shirt he 'd had on when he boarded the plane at seven-thirty in the morning . He went to the meeting , ate the traditional chicken dinner , made his speech and returned to Pittsburgh with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked not about his speech or the crowd 's reaction to it but about politics and people and the Presidents he has known . " F.D.R. , " he said , " was the greatest when it came to handling people . He knew exactly how to get them to do what he wanted . " Then there was a sudden gentling of the voice which normally has a slight rasp . He was talking now of the first national convention he 'd ever attended  --  in 1912 ? when Woodrow Wilson was nominated . " Wilson " ? he said ? " Wilson was the real class . " One of Lawrence 's friends says that Lawrence , w h o never got to college , would naturally admire Wilson , a college president . In his time as mayor of Pittsburgh his interest in education was intense . One man says that when Lawrence became a member of the board of the University of Pittsburgh , " I think he was more touched than when he was elected mayor . " Educators have always found his door open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has never turned down an invitation to speak in school or college . Those who have heard him talking with students see a side that few politicians know . His whole manner mellows . His rugged features soften , and his smile , not often seen , comes quickly and easily . And he answers impertinent questions with candor . " The kids , " says Walter Giesey , who 's been Lawrence 's executive secretary since 1954 , " can ask him things that no one else would dare , " To Lawrence , talking to youngsters is relaxation . Bridge , golf and the country-club life do not interest him ; nor is he a poker player . Gin rummy and two-handed pinochle are enough . During the 1957 street-railway strike in Pittsburgh , he brought together a small group of men to help him in his efforts to settle it . During the long hours of waiting , they would play gin rummy for small stakes . And in his city-hall office there 's a tribute to his skill  --  a television set from the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIN RUMMY You CA N'T RE BEAT . BUT IF IN THE FUTURE WE CHANCE TO MEET , WE 'D RATHER NOT JUST LOSE OUR DOUGH , BUT TURN THIS ON , AND WATCH THE SHOW . In Pittsburgh , Lawrence began a daily ritual that he says helps him relax . After his twelve to fourteen hours at work he would go to the local for a steam bath , " That makes me feel tine , " he says . " Then I can go home , hii  --  e my dinner , read for a while and go to bed . " Home in Pittsburgh is a large stone house in a typical middle-class section of the city . He has lived there for the past fifteen years . His wife , Alice , who seldom appears with him at purely political functions , cooks his dinner . Their son . Jerry , is on hand , when he 's not attending La Salle College in Philadelphia , and one or both of his married daughters may drop in . But Lawrence does not parade his family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family life is his belief that drama is needed in politics . In 1944 , when Lawrence was pushing for Harry Truman to run with Roosevelt for F.D.R. 's fourth term , Lawrence showed that belief . The Democratic convention was in its second night . Labor forces led by Sidney Hillman were determined to win the second spot again for Henry Wallace . The galleries in Chicago 's big arena were jammed with Wallace supporters  --  a stampede was planned to crush Truman 's hopes . But that stampede never came . Lawrence arranged for the chairman , Sen. Samuel Jackson , to call on him as a delegate from Pennsylvania . When he was recognized , Lawrence promptly moved for adjournment . In the voice vote that followed , the noes buried the ayes , but the chairman ruled that the vote for adjournment had carried . " It was dramatic , " Lawrence says and adds with a smile , " It also gave us the time we needed . " And he had gauged the situation correctly ; by the next day the big steam had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1960 Democratic convention , just as in 1944 , Lawrence will be thinking of the dramatic  --  and the time to make it work . He is quite familiar with smoke-filled rooms and knows how men use the corner buffet , with its choice of Scotch , bourbon , gin or rye , and the cigars dotting desks and tables , there for the taking . But Lawrence does n't smoke , and his drinking is limited . He has said , " I 'll have a bottle of beer  --  not cocktails or hard liquor . I 'm not a prohibitionist . But I have Irish blood in my veins , and I do n't think the Irish know how to carry whisky . " Of a certain acquaintance who tipples , Lawrence taps a finger against his temple and says , " Slave . " Lawrence 's self-control would let him be slave to nothing , not even ambition . He says , " I have seen too many men  --  fine men  --  who 've been bitten by that bug , and been ruined as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in politics as if they were yesterday instead of fifty years ago , " I 've never forgotten watching the men who 'd been beaten in elections . Just a few days before , everybody had been rushing up to shake their hands . But when it was over and they 'd been defeated , nobody bothered much to speak to them . And that they did n't know how to take . I was just a kid , but it taught me a lot . " Ambition for any public office beyond that of mayor of Pittsburgh was something few could believe Lawrence possessed . Before 1958 he had twice turned down his party 's offer to be its candidate for governor of Pennsylvania . Only a handful thought of him for that office in 1958 , before one cold March day last year . Gathered in a second-floor room of the Democratic state headquarters at Harrisburg were the party 's top state leaders . There were Governor Leader , Sen. Joseph Sill Clark , Mayor Richardsorn , Dilworth of Philadelphia , state chairman Joseph Barr , Philadelphia 's city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in delivering the vole  --  and , of course , Lawrence , It was a setting made for drama . Time was running out . The Democrats had to pick a candidate . Everyone in the room knew that Leader had said he would accept one of only four men : Dilworth , Senator Clark , his attorney general , Thomas D. McBride , or Lawrence . Clark had said he would n't run . Dilworth was opposed by his own city chairman , Green , the vote getter . McBride was a noted lawyer in the state , but he was a political newcomer and a Catholic to boot . He said he was not seeking the nomination , but when the Catholic iSSUC had been raised against his candidacy he thought that " an abomination . " No party , he said , could be committed to any crusade to prove that a Catholic could be governor . And , he said , he knew the decision would be based on no such crusade . He said he was supporting Dilworth . As the session broke for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches were being brought in . Green left for a private talk with his closest adviser , James P. Clark , owner of a trucking firm . Returning , he said , " We could agree on Lawrence . " All the others said this was their man . Lawrence sealed the decision . " If 5ATIIUDAy EVE.NIN , ? r.i a my running will keep the party together , he said , " I 'd be willing . " An hour later the reporters were calk in to hear the governor announce tha Lawrence would make the race . Whil Leader spoke , Lawrence sat calmly look ing at the floor , a slight smile on his fact if he was elated , it showed in no way . 0 ; this occasion , as on many others , he gay the impression of a carefully curbed man There are some in Pennsylvania who in sist that Lawrence , the political expert had set his ducks in line long before th meeting , and then watched them fall a planned , one by one . But Lawrence say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw himself as the candi date  --  a harmony candidate behind whom the party could unite . In his campaign Lawrence talked al ways of the importance of Pennsylvanian working for Pennsylvania , without grea regard for party labels . There were mo ments when his campaign made Thoma E. Dewey 's high-level effort in 1948 seen hell-lire and brimstone by comparison Nothing , not even the Sherman Adam affair , could bring Lawrence down fron the cool heights of nonpartisan oratory It might have been dull  --  but in Law . rence 's thinking he played it right . lo Republican could fairly take of fense at his campaign . Since taking oft ( his approach to the Republican Party ha been , as one newspaper put it , " witt olive branch in hand ... entirely fitting and intelligent . . . . " Pennsylvania , tom in the Republican ranks , has a conservative tradition . Lawrence 's record show that he has great talents for working witt conservatives when they aim at a corn . mon goal . His predecessor , Governor Leader , was buffeted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not plan to run the sacs course . " Political arrogance , " he ha ! said , " is political suicide . " He must dea with a Republican state senate . Therefore he appointed Republicans as well a Democrats to an all-important tax-polic3 committee to suggest new ways of raising money for the financially strapped slat ( government . Within twenty-four hours of taking of fice , Lawrence adopted a Republic.ar suggestion  --  that there be a cut-to-the. bone policy in state spending . Among tht early casualties  --  Lawrence . The Leader Administration , in the usual tradition 01 an outgoing regime , had arranged for tht state to buy a $10,000 car for the incom , ing governor . Lawrence ordered the bid canceled . Instead , he said a state-ownec car , which had already been driven 90,00 ( miles , would do nicely . But when the Susquehanna River wen on a flooding rampage  --  and drownec twelve miners  --  Lawrence won the legis lature 's approval on a $3,000,000 retie program that passed with incredible speed . Lawrence knew of the disaster : heartbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours after he had been sworn in as goy governor . Typical of Lawrence , he called meeting of his cabinet on Sunday night so his program would be ready for the legislature the next morning . To Law rence a Sunday-night meeting is not un usual . Politics , in his view , is a seven-day a-week operation . But even with the problems he faces ii his own state , Lawrence can /lever be to tally insular . He thinks , as he always ha of the national picture . Even before Ii was sworn in as governor , Lawrence wa meeting with other top party leaders t , discuss 1960 . Lawrence of Pennsylvania the Democrats ' tough old pro , knows tha now is the time to begin setting the stag for the political drama yet to come .
