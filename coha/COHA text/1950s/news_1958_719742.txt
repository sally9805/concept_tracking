txt Just as it seemed to be evident that no steel executive ; would , or could , speak out in favor of a hold-the-line in steel wages and prices , it happened . A particularly respected man in the industry , R. L. Gray , president of the Armco Steel Corporation ? fourth in steel sales , seventh in steel-ingot capacity  --  breezed in from Middletown , Ohio , and almost casually dropped the heretofore forbidden words : steel management , said Mr. Gray , is in favor of a wage-price hold-the-line . Mr. Gray commented that steel people agree it would be a good thing to hold the line " but the contract says we have to raise wages and every time we raise wages , we raise costs . " Armco Spokesman Mr. Gray , of course , was only giving his opinion on how he felt aU of the steel people thought . He carries only formal credentials to speak for Armco . And in his quiet , modest manner he was in no way professing to be speaking for United States Steel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  --  and this is significant ? Mr. Gray , in almost nonchalant tones seemed to be saying that , most naturally , all these gentlemen would be of one mind on this important subject . The weight of Mr. Gray 's remarks is obvious : At the very minimum he was speaking for himself and his ? own company , and no one else his . . ; at level in the steel industry ? has been so courageous . And Mr. Gray , patently , felt he was speaking out in the public interest well as his company 's interest . Furthermore , his words certainly held true for a number of other companies  --  some of which have indicated their off-the-record sentiments to this reporter . Also , one big company , completely behind the scenes , 1 has even approached David J. I , president of the United Steelworkers of America . on the wage-price deferral subject . Labor Relations Good Now the hidden hopes , the quiet desires of the steel industry have found expression . Perhaps Mr. Gray did n't realize the full import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Gray is a most knowledgable executive and a real veteran in the business . He has , however , only been at Armco 's helm for the past two years . Armco 's position with its own labor people is particularly strong , its record of good relations with its own labor people particularly good . Perhaps it was from this position of strength that Mr. Gray spoke . Mr. Gray said that steel would have to raise prices if , the automatic raise comes about in July . " It is pretty much up to , " he said . " If he insists , then the steel companies . must raise prices . " Concern on Inflation When interviewed in the offices of the National Supply Company here ( a new subsidiary now of Armco ) , Mr. Gray said : " Labor and business of the country must really stop inflation . Otherwise it will ruin our competitive position here and all over the world . " He said that management in steel is as much concerned about inflation as anyone else . Wages , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. , president of National Supply , at this point contributed his viewpoint on the subject : he said there could be no wage increase without a steel-price increase at-this time -- in the foreseeable future . Mr. Gray said , " I do n't see how we can raise wages without raising prices . " Then referring to poor earnings records turned in by a number of steel producers in the first quarter , he added that " it would be a pretty sorry looking picture if the steel companies did n't raise prices " when their costs rise July I. Unanimity Seen Occasion for some of Mr. Gray 's remarks was a press luncheon at the tradition steeped Duquesne Club  --  a get together linked to Armco 's recent merger with National Supply . It was the merger , in fact , that moved Armco up to fourth position in steel sales  --  the company thus displacing Jones &; Laughlin on the fourth rung in the steel industry . On two other occasions in his interview Mr. Gray emphasized his viewpoint on the unanimity of steel management 's viewpoint : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel industry agrees with it ? to hold the line . " Later he said , " I feel all of the steel people feel there should be a hold the line . " Perhaps the real significance in the Gray remarks is that it now seems to open the way for other steel executives to speak out and perhaps even urge that some hold-the-line agreement be vigorously explored .
