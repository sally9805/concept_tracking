In spite of the easygoing luncheon chatter that day in 1955. the four Chicago educators were obviously worried . How , they wanted to know , could the city 's colleges and universities , already jammed with 100,000 students , take care of the double enrollment expected by 1970 ? Then John W. Taylor , onetime president of the University of Louisville and now executive director of Chicago 's new educational TV station , began to outline a plan . Though no city had ever tried it . Taylor 's three companions-Chancellor Lawrence Kimpton of the University of Chicago , President John Rettaliata of the Illinois Institute of Technology and Chairman Lenox Lohr of the Illinois governor 's commission on higher education-decided that the idea might be just the thing to help solve their problem . <P> A Dozen Stars . Taylor 's plan involved putting a full two years of college on TV . With School Superintendent Benjamin Willis , he decided to work through the city 's four junior colleges , whose teachers would start out by giving four freshman courses over WTTW , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one course or all four , could work for credit ( and an Associate of Arts degree ) or merely audit . The response was greater than even the most optimistic officials anticipated . When the nation 's first TV college began this fall , it had 1,364 students . <P> The junior college faculties and WTTW 's staff worked all summer preparing for their opening . For the first experimental year , they settled on four subjects : English , biology , political and social science . Though the academic content was left entirely to the academics , each course was treated as a " show , " with its own producer and technical staff . Out of more than 30 faculty volunteers , the colleges and TVmen picked twelve who seemed both able and telegenic enough to go over . Then , after a series of auditions , they chose each show 's " star . " But behind the four stars is a staff of about 60 colleagues who help prepare lectures , grade papers , and counsel students . <P> A Wider Audience . Since there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover in half an hour what would take him 50 minutes in class . Otherwise , the teachers ' performances are just as they would be at their colleges . They use no gimmicks , speak from a set that looks like an ordinary classroom lecture platform . Each daytime lecture is put on film and shown again for students who can study only at night . <P> If Chicago 's experiment continues as successfully as it has begun , the TV college may well become a standard part of the U.S. educational system . Though it can never take the place of a live campus , it may be a way to present top academic talent to a wider audience and help relieve the nation 's classroom and teacher shortage . In any case , WTTW is giving scores of men and women , including 52 who are handicapped , their only chance to go to college . Among the handicapped : a totally paralyzed 22-year-old who must depend on a rocking bed to breathe ; a deaf girl who finds that she can easily read her professors ' lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each lecture , plays it back to herself until she has mastered it . Says she : " I do n't care if I flunk . These courses are giving me something I was starved for-intellectual intercourse . I have contact with these people . "
