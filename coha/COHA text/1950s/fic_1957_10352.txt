sounds of Tokyo were nearly indistinguishable , now , from those of a European city , but he could not rid himself from watchful tension or from the intuitions which no one could help developing in the business . He was full of the old malaise that told him that a net was closing . The elderly man in San Franciscoand the Nisei Japanese boy were parts of it , and so was the middle-aged Japanese named Moto who had picked him up at the airport . You developed a seventh sense for spotting opposite numbers ; he would have bet his last dollar that Mr. Moto was in the business , except for the clumsy use of a name that , as Bill Gibson had pointed out , was not a name at all . It was so obvious that it might have been a signal , but there was no way of being sure . And then Pender was another strand of the net . If he had not said that he was a former U.S.O. entertainer , the Beretta in the car was indicative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the run . The net was closing on Bill Gibson , and Bill knew it , but it might be , Jack Rhyce thought , that he and Ruth Bogart were still out of it . He was almost positive that Mr. Pender had accepted them . Mr. Moto was due to call at six . There would be a chance then to evaluate and handle him , and until six there was nothing to do but rest . Then suddenly he realized he had forgotten something , and immediately he pushed open the adjoining door . Ruth Bogart was asleep . The hardness which he had occasionally noticedon her face was gone . The tenseness about her mouth had relaxed . Although her eyes were closed , she had a half-cheerful , half-expectant look . She was a very pretty girl now that she was asleep , the way she would have looked on the outside , and he was sure that her dreams had taken her there . He was sorry to bring her back into the business.  | " Sorry , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had been at the girl 's branch of the Farm from the way she awakened . A second before she had been on the outside ; now her right hand had moved toward her handbag , but it was only a half-conscious gesture . " Okay , " she said softly . " What ? " " This Moto character who 's calling at six , " he said . " I think he 'll ring the house telephone and not barge up like Pender . I 'll leave our door open . The bell will wake you . Get up and close the door but listen , and keep that fountain pen handy . It might just be we 'll have to use it . Do you follow me , Ruth ? " " Yes , " she said . " I 'd have covered you anyway , Buster . Now go and relax or you 'll be fidgety when he comes , and leave the door wide open . Do n't be so delicate . I need company . " He could not tell whether she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he felt a twinge of annoyance because he had never liked the name , and also the mere fact that he was annoyed worried him . He would not have given the matter any thought if he had not been tired.  |p102HE  STILL could not sleep when he lay down again . The truthbegun to dawn on him that he was not physically the man he had been , that his old resilience and iron were wearing thin , and that he would have been better even three years earlier . Everyone in the business burned out eventually . Either their physical reflexes slowed up first , or their ability to keep concentrated on a single line . He knew it was the worst possible time to put his thoughts on a personal basis . It had been the girl 's face that looked so young and happy in its sleep that had disturbedhim . He began thinking , just when he should not have , of the outside . If he had stayed on the outside he would undoubtedlybe married by now . He would have been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he would have been a decent man  --  warm-hearted and genuine  --  not a suspicious , machine-tooled robot who had been through too much , a man who had played under so many covers that it was becoming impossible to guess what he could have been . Of course there had always been people like himself who could not easily adjust to civil life after having faced the violencesof war . There had been wonderful moments and triumphs . There was always the satisfaction of knowing that in ten years he had made a place for himself in a highly exacting profession , but in the end , what was there of real value ? Very little ,  |p103exce|pt  what might lie in a set of disconnected memories , very little of which to be proud . And what was he in the end ? He was a spy , or a secret agent , if you cared for a politer word , trained to live a life of lying and of subterfuge ; trained to submerge his individuality into something he was not  --  to be a sneak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger and let his best friend get it , if it helped the business ; to kill or be killed inconspicuously ; to die with his mouth shut , in the dark . There was only one loyalty  --  loyalty to the business . It was , by outside standards , a contemptible profession , and in the end , everybody in the business paid , because deceit was the same as erosion of character . Why had he not gotten out of it , before it was too late ? He raised himself on his elbow . The whisky flask was in his bag and the glasses were on the table . He could even see the traces of Ruth Bogart 's lipstick on her glass . She should have been more careful . He sat up , with his eyes still on the bag , but then he leaned back again . Drinking was always dangerous in the business  --  it was far safer to indulge in bitter thoughts . It was too late for him to leave the business now . He remembered what she had called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get from the inside to the outside once you were a pro . He wished to heaven he could sleep as she did . It meant that she still could get out of the business ; he hoped she would . He resolved to tell her so , if they came out of this safe . He must have been thinking of what he would say to her just as he fell asleep . He was convinced that he was not the man he had been once , when the telephone awakened him . He heard Ruth Bogart close the adjoining door before he was on his feet . First he had not been able to sleep . Then he had slept too heavily , and like Ruthp104Bogart , he must have been on the outside , too , in his dreams . It was something that should never happen in the field . " Hello , " he said . " Jack Rhyce speaking . " At any rate , he was back under his cover again , hearty voice and everything . The time on his wrist watch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also rested . He was on the beam again . " Please . " It was undoubtedly Mr. Moto speaking . There was the slow , gentle modulation he remembered , and also the monotonyof speech that even excellent Japanese linguists sometimesfound hard to escape . " I hope I did not awaken you , Mr. Rhyce . " " Oh , it 's you , is it ? " Jack Rhyce said . " Do I sound sleepy ? " There was a nervous laugh that went with conventional politeness . " Just a little in your voice , Mr. Rhyce . " He had to admit that the man downstairs was a damned smart Jap , and when they were , it was hard to find anything smarter . " ' Well , you win , as a matter of fact , " Jack Rhyce said . " I have been having a little shut-eye . But come on right up , you 've got the room number , have n't you ? " " The room number ? Oh , yes . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was time for jack Rhyce to tie his shoes , and put on his seersucker coat . As he did so he realized he had not unpacked anything . He hastily opened his Val-pak and pulled some clothes out , because he did not want to give the impression that he might leave at any moment . Then he left the door to the hall half open because a locked door might be conspicuous , and thenp105his heart gave a startled jump . He had completely forgotten the three glasses on the table , but as he moved toward them he saw that only two were there , one with the lipstick smears , and another . Ruth Bogart must have been in when he was asleep , and he felt very much ashamed . He should have thought of the two glasses himself  --  one of them with lipstick . The tap on the door was gentle and discreet . Jack Rhyce was accustomed to Japanese manners , and he had listened for many wearisome hours to lectures by social anthropologists on Japanesepsychology , but from his own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correctness of many of the lecturers ' conclusions . The background and the thought process of Japan were so different from his own that he had alwaysavoided a confident appraisal . When Mr. Moto knocked , Jack felt a species of nervousness . He knew too much about Japan , yet he must not show it . Japanese were always sensitive . " Well , well , " Jack Rhyce said , " step right in . You 're right on the dot , I see . " He spoke loudly and deliberately , as one should to a foreigner . Mr. Moto 's features were finely chiseled . His hands were slenderand graceful . In native dress , he would have been a fine figure of a trusted Samurai , and it was very possible that his familyhad held that feudal rank . But the hideous , purplish blue business suit , aggressively pressed and arrogantly neat , ruined this romantic picture , and so did the very light tan shoes . Mr. Moto was more a figure of low comedy than a representative of old Japan . Then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Moto might both be impersonating clumsy people . If you took it one way , the hissing intake of Mr. Moto 's breath hadp106a Weber and Fields quality that was too loud and too comic . The same was true of his speech , yet Jack Rhyce could not definitelytell . " So nice of you to receive me , " Mr. Moto said . " You have enjoyedyour sleep , I hope . " " Yes , sir , " Jack Rhyce said . " I had a real nice shut-eye , thanks , and I feel very much the better for it , Mr.  --  excuse me . I forget your name . " Moto , " Mr. Moto said . He laughed again , but there was no way of telling whether or not his politeness was deliberately overdrawn . " Moto , " Jack Rhyce said . If they were playing a Mr. Japan and Mr. America game , both of them knew their business . " I 've got that straight now , and I hope you 'll excuse it , Mr. Moto . Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose my name is hard for you  --  Rhyce . " " Oh , no , " Mr. Moto said . " R is easy in Japan . We have troublewhen we pronounce your letter rell . See  --  I can not say it . Ha-ha-ha . " It was hard for Jack Rhyce to decide whether or not Mr. Moto was having deliberate trouble with his l 's . It was true that the l sound was difficult for Japanese to accomplish , although good linguists could manage it . In the Pacific during the War , Jack Rhyce remembered , there had been a sea area christened " Alligator Lipstick . " The term had been invented because the area was frequently mentioned by voice over the air and " AlligatorLipstick " was a jawbreaker for the average Japanese . It seemed to Jack Rhyce that sometimes Mr. Moto was having no trouble with his l 's at all . " That is comical , when you come to think of it , " Jack Rhycep107said , " but it takes all kinds to make a world , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry after that plane ride . I wonder if we could get some bacon and shirred eggs and tea . Maybe you can make the room boy understand in Japanese better than I can in English . Ha-ha-ha . " As he spoke he felt sorry for Ruth Bogart listening at the connecting door , and he added , " A whole flock of bacon and eggs and tea . " " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said . " I shall call up room service . Everythingis up to date at the Imperiar Hote-ru . Excuse me when I can not say the 1 . " There was no breaking the law of averages . Sooner or later there would be a slip of the tongue , or else a careless gesture might become a chain reaction that ruined everything . Mr. Moto had slipped , and Jack Rhyce was sure that he was unaware of it . Mr. Moto had surmounted that stumbling block of the Japanese tongue by pronouncing the letter 1 with a subconscious fluency , indicating that he could speak a better brand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel telephone and asked for room service in Japanese , his accent was crisp and educated . There was something in the careless way in which he handled the instrument that was not Japanese , or English , or German , and certainly not Russian . His posture was very good , as he stood speaking into the receiver , showing that he had done his tour of military duty  --  the army , Jack Rhyce guessed , rather than navy ; and if it was the army , he might have been in the fanatical wing that started the war . His face showed no passion or arrogance , but it was hard to classify Japanese features . When Mr. Moto gave the order , he asked for bacon and eggs and coffee  --  not tea ; and Jack Rhyce was certain he had men/tioned tea . He could not suppress a quiet satisfaction as he sat and listened to Mr. Moto 's Japanese . He felt rested , and Mr. Moto had lost a trick in pronouncing the letter 1 . " Everything will be right up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in China . Ha-ha . " " That 's mighty kind of you , " Jack Rhyce said . " This languagebarrier is a pretty tough thing , is n't it ? Sit down , wo n't you please ? And I do hope the food does come up chop-chop , as you say . I could certainly do with a cup of coffee . " You were bound to fall flat on your face at one time or another . He could have bitten off his tongue the moment he mentionedcoffee , but already it was too late . There was nothing to do but go ahead , without showing a trace of embarrassment . " You know you 've come at just the right time , Mr. Moto , " he said . " I 'm here to do a piece of work for an organization known as the Asia Friendship League , something in the nature of a report , and the more I think of it , the more sure I am that I 'll need somebody like you to show me around . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ; Jack Rhyce had a feeling that tension had relaxed when Mr. Moto saw them . There might have been some truth in that phrase of Bill Gibson 's  --  safety in sex . You could discount a good deal of potential menace in a man if you saw a glass with lipstick smears in his bedroom . " The Asia Friendship League , " Mr. Moto said . " How very , very nice . The United States is such a kind nation , after the war , to do such nice things for Japan . The Asia Friendship League is known to me , and Mr. Pender , its new head , is such a good , nice man . " So you know Mr. Pender ? " Jack Rhyce said . " Well , that'sp109fine . I 've already had a warm and really constructive talk with him . He 's going to show me around the shop tomorrow , and so I 'm afraid I 'll be pretty much engaged tomorrow . By the way , how about a little drink , Mr. Moto ? Oh-oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , no , " Mr. Moto said , " not for me . But you  --  prease , you help yourself . " Jack Rhyce took his flask from his open kit-bag and poured himself another drink . " I suppose the tap water 's all right in Tokyo ? " he asked . " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said . " You see , the American Army has been here . " " Oh , yes , " Jack Rhyce said . " Well , as I was saying , I 'm goingto be busy tomorrow , but Saturday and Sunday I shall need a little rest and relaxation . You know  --  maybe you 've got a saying in japan like ours in the States  --  all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy ? And the nice thing about that little maxim is , my first name happens to be Jack . " Jack Rhyce smiled fatuously and sipped his drink . He was almostsure that Mr. Moto was smiling sympathetically . " There are lots of amusements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would be so preased to show geisha girls or anything , Mr. Rhyce . " Jack Rhyce laughed easily . " That would be swell sometime later , " he said . " But this Saturdayand Sunday I was thinking of taking a spin into the country . You see , I was here in the Occupation for a day or two , and the army had taken over a hotel up in the mountains . I 've got the name of the place written down . It 's in Mio  --  Mio  --  " " Oh , " Mr. Moto said , " Miyanoshita . Very nice . "  |p110Jack  Rhyce took another sip from his drink , and gave Mr. Moto a man-to-man look . " Well , I thought if you could rent me a good car , and a driver , I might go up there , and well  --  you know , take a girl along . " Mr. Moto nodded and tactfully drew in his breath . " Oh , yes , " he said . " I can drive myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice girl . " " That 's it , " Jack Rhyce said . " That 's the spirit , Mr. Moto . I had a hunch , right when I saw you at the airport , that you 'd be broadminded . A man has to have fun sometime , does n't he ? " " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said . " Oh , yes . If you wish , I can find four or five girls and you can make a choice . " " Well , that 's fine , " Jack Rhyce said , " but you supply the car , and I 'll supply the young lady . Be around here at nine o'clock on Saturday morning . " " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said , " and we can see Kamakura  --  many interesting things . The Daibutsu Buddha  --  very big and very old , and Eno-shima  --  very rovery , very many things . " There was a knock on the door . It was a waiter with bacon and eggs and coffee . Mr. Moto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the older than the newer generation . " Nine , Saturday , " he said . " Big , fine American car . Everythingfirst-crass . You will be satisfied , I am sure , and thank you very much . Good night then , Mr. Rhyce . " It had been a long while since Jack Rhyce had been so unsure of his cover work . He could not tell exactly what anything was about , except that there had been that atmosphere of tenseness , and a combat of minds . That slip of his still worried him . There was no need to exaggerate its potential danger . His expressionp111must have disturbed Ruth Bogart when he called her to come in . " What went wrong ? " she asked . " You sounded so terrific , you almost made me feel sick to my stomach . " Jack Rhyce pointed to the table and the tray . " Sit down and eat it , " he said . " I 'll order up some more from room service . " He stopped and imitated Mr. Moto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperiar Hote-ru . " " But what is worrying you ? " she asked . " The coffee , " he answered , and he told her . " Well , it 's over now , " she said . " I did n't know you knew a word of Japanese . You said you 'd hardly ever been in Japan . " There was nothing to do , and time stretched ahead of them uninterruptedly until the next morning . There was actually no reason why he should not talk about himself , or why they should not be reasonable human beings for a while . " Frankly , " he said , " I did live in Japan from the age zero to five . Japanese servants are devoted to kids , and I was speaking the language all the time . My father was a missionary , and the moral of that story is always to look out for missionaries ' sons . " " You 're too conscientious for me to have to look out for you , " she said . " Why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He had not talked about the outside to anyone for several years . It was an unfamiliar and rather agreeable experience , to be sitting there in Tokyo , thinking of the outside . " My father wanted me to keep it up , " he said , " and he made me for quite a while . You see  --  do n't laugh  --  he wanted me to be a missionary , too . It 's peculiar what parents want their children to be , is n't it ? The language came right back to me in the war at language school . "  |p112He  stopped and passed the flask to her . " We may as well finish this , " he said , " and you heard what our friend told us  --  tap water 's good in Tokyo . And thanks for doing that about the glasses . Thanks a lot . " " Do n't mention it , " she said . " You ca n't be a mastermind all the time , you know . Did he notice ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wait until you see more of him . I 'm afraid he 's very smart . " " Afraid ? " she repeated . " That 's right , " he said . " I do n't know where he fits in  --  not to mention this man Pender in the Chevrolet . " He had forgotten that she did not know about Harry Pender . " We 're still in the clear with him , I think , " he said , " or he would n't have told about that U.S.O. singing caravan . But we 're running into something . " Her manner changed as she listened . All the outlines of her face had hardened . Her eyes were still very pretty , but they had hardened , too . " Yes , " she said , " we 're walking into something , but let 's not take it too big , if you know what I mean . " " I wish I could place the Jap , " he said . " It 's what I tell you .. I ca n't make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " We 'll find out . We 're walking into it , but do n't take it too big . " " There 's the second time you 've said that . Just what do you mean ? " he asked . She thought for a moment before she answered , and the hardnesshad not left her face . " I suppose I 'll have to be personal , " she said . " We 're teamed up on this , and we 've got to stick together , and you 're runningp113the show , of course . I do n't know as much as you do , but I 've seen enough to like the way you work . There 's only one thing about you that makes me nervous . " From the way that he reacted he knew that his nerves were still edgy , and he found it difficult to keep annoyance out of his voice . " I 'm sorry if I make you nervous , " he told her . " Go ahead and tell me why . " " Because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack , " she told him . " You try to think of everything , and no one can . Why not try to just think of one or two things tonight , and put the rest out of your head ? It will be back in the morn-ing . " " All right , " he said . " Name the one or two things . " " Well , I 'll name one , " she answered . " How about thinking about me for a while ? I wish you would n't take me as another responsibility . I 'm really not as bad as that . Remember about the glasses ? " When she smiled at him his nerves were not on edge any longer . " I mean , " she said , " let 's try to be friends as well as business associates . I think it would help the cover if we found out a little more about each other  --  what we really are , I mean , and not what we 're pretending to be . We can pick that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " We do n't know much about each other , do we ? And maybe you 're right . Maybe it would n't be a bad idea . " " Then go ahead and be yourself , " she said . " Say anything , but for heaven 's sake let 's be ourselves . For instance , say somethingp114about japan that is n't a free lecture . Just go ahead and say something . " Her mood , it struck him , was the same as his had been before he had fallen asleep . He understood exactly what she meant , and it saddened him that it was an effort to do what she asked . Instinctivecaution was all around him . He had been in the business too long . " Well , " he said , " I suppose childhood is an impressionable age . Even if you ca n't remember the details , they are all back in your mind somewhere . I have n't been back to Japan since I was five , except for a few days in the Occupation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in it because I used to go to the mission school . I used to play with the gardener 's boy . " He paused and cleared his throat . " Is that the conversational line you wanted ? " " Yes , " she said , " it is , and it 's the first time you 've been naturalsince I 've seen you . Now I know quite a lot about you , but you do n't know anything about me . " " No , " he said , " but you do n't have to tell me , Ruth . " " But are n't you curious about me ? " she asked . " Guess what I was outside ? Are n't you curious enough to guess ? " He was surprised that she asked the question because girls in the business seldom cared to talk about their pasts . It was a safe bet they all had them , and rather lurid ones , or they would not have been in the business . There was always some tragedy of love , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was requitedby the business . As his glance met hers , and as she raised her eyebrows slightly , he honestly preferred to take her as she was , without knowing any more . " Why , yes , " he said , " I could make an educated guess about you , but I do n't know that you 'd like it . "  |p115Her  glance met his again , and then shifted . " You 're such a damn pro  --  are n't you ? " she asked  --  " you know everything . " He was sorry to detect an undertone of antagonism in what she said . Antagonism , or clash of personality , would seriously interfere with their working smoothly together . He knew that she must be tired by the trip , and by Bill Gibson 's hurried call , and by the Japanese ; the appearance of Mr. Pender in the dented Chevrolet did not help to soothe one 's nerves . The truth was that neither of them did know anything about the other , and in his opinion it was better that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was better to keep things on an impersonal basis , if possible , and not to quarrel or be unkind ; but the strain of the day had told on him , too . Otherwise , he would not have been led further into the conversation . " I 'm sorry if I 've displeased you , " he said . " I 've got a lot on my mind , you know . Of course I do n't know everything , but maybe I 've been around more than you have , and I 've been acquainted with a lot of girls in the business  --  some good and some not . I know how they look and how they act , and I 've oftenhad to check their backgrounds . Naturally I can make an educated guess about you . Naturally I 've made one to myself al-ready . " He was sorry to notice that her face had flushed . " So you think I 'm just another tramp , " she said . " Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you anything . There 's no cause for you to lose your temper , Ruth . " " I 'm not losing my temper , " she answered . He knew this was not true . " But I do think if two people are going to work to/gether they understand each other better if they know something about each other , and if they 're friends and not acquaintances . Suppose you tell me what you think you know about me , and I 'll tell you if you 're right . " " Why do n't we keep what we think about each other to ourselves ? " he said . " It might save a lot of trouble , but if you want it your way , I 'll go along . " There was no use antagonizing her just when work was starting , but she had challenged his professional pride . " If you stay in this racket , " he said , " as long as I 've been in it , you 'll naturally learn to notice things about people , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further if you just sit quietly and look . All right , if you want the professor to give you an analysis  --  in the first place , you 're not in the tramp class , and you never will be . You 're too well bred . You have too much background and character to be a tramp . " " That 's nice to know , " she answered . " Go ahead , what else ? " He was no longer reluctant to go ahead . He had finally become interested in his ideas . If he had any gifts , his best had always been analysis of people . " Now most girls in your position , " he said , " always tell the same story . All of them are always born of wealthy parents , usuallyliving on Southern plantations . Then along came a business failure , or else they married an undesirable man . The undesirable man is usually correct  --  but in your case the rest of it is true . You come from an excellent background . You were brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell which , from your accent . Upper-class accents are reasonably interchangeable . " " Go ahead , " she said . " What else ? " " You never spent all the year in the city . " He had forgottenp117Tokyo . He was always interested in blocking out a character . " You spent a lot of your time , while you were growing up , in the country  --  a riding country , but not the West . You schooled and jumped horses once . " There was a flicker of interest in her glance . " What made you make that guess ? " she asked . " Your posture , " he said , " but mainly your hands . You have beautiful hands , but they are strong above the average . They are riding hands . " " All right , " she said . " You hit that one . Go ahead . " " All right , " he said , " if you 'll excuse my being personal . One or two things you said on this trip make me think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal from people . You should , because you 're exceedingly good-looking . " " Why , thanks , " she said . " I 'm a man , " he answered . " It 's obvious ; but I do n't think I 've been influenced by it . " " And , believe me , I have n't tried to influence you , " she said . " And do n't worry . I wo n't . So you think I was spoiled , do you ? All right , I was , by the family and the servants . " " I 'd also guess that you 're an only child , " he said . " That 's only an educated guess . I 'd say your father had great personal charm . Drinkers do , and I 'm afraid he was . a drunk . I 've noticed how your expression changes every time I pick up my glass . You loved him and he disappointed you  --  so you were disillusioned by the father image . He died , I imagine , while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married again , and you were on the loose with an independent income  --  a bright , popular girl . You went to college , and I 'll bet it was nearer to Bryn Mawr than Goucher . You fell in love , and the boy friendp118left you flat . He was n't killed in Korea or anything . He left you flat . " " What makes you say that ? " she asked . " From the way you act with a man , " he said . " You do n't trust men . Then you met the Chief . The Chief 's good at spotting material , and he found that you were a natural at the business . You were rattling around loose , just the way I was when the Chief found me , and that 's about all . " When he had finished he knew he had been very close to being right , from the cool suspicious way in which she looked at him . " Just how did you happen to see my file ? " she asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slowly . " No file , " he said . " I 've only found out about you by minding my own business , watching you . You asked for it . " She was looking at him with a new respect . At least her antagonismhad gone . Suddenly she smiled at him , and he knew that they were friends . " You make me feel naked , " she said , " or like the tattooed woman in the circus . I did n't know I had everything written on me in fine print . Actually , in case you want to know , we owned a place in Virginia . In fact , I own it still . " " Now , listen , " he said , " you do n't have to tell me anything more about yourself . It does n't help the general situation , and we should n't be talking like this . It 's too dangerous , Ruth . " She shook her head in an exasperated way . " You 're always damn careful , are n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dangerous ? " " When you get talking this way you get interested , " he said . " It 's dangerous to get interested , or like anyone too much in thep119business , Ruth . You might have to ditch me , or I might have to ditch you tomorrow . You know that . " His hand rested on her shoulder , and she had not moved away , and he was right that it was dangerous . " Well , thank heaven you have a human side , " she said . " And I 'm glad we 've talked this way , and to hell with the business untiltomorrow . " She brushed his hand off and stood up . " Look , we have n't had anything to eat . Call for a room waiter since everything 's so modern at the Imperial Hotel , and these eggs are cold , and everything . And I have another flask in my suitcase . After all , you 're supposed to be crazy about me , Jack . " He was right that the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emotional involvement . He knew that he was at least coming very close to breaking several of them , but he had never realized that the prospect could be so pleasant . For a moment or two , at any rate , he felt he was himselfagain , exactly as he had been on the outside . It was a transient sensation , but at the same time , it was a revelation , because he had never believed that clocks turned back . " Let 's save your flask for some other time , " he said . " I 'm havinga good time without it . In fact  --  " He stopped because his training was back with him . " In fact , what ? " she asked . That twinge of caution was gone when he looked at her . He knew he was saying what a great many others had said before him , and yet he did not care . " Maybe it wo n't hurt if we took a little time off , " he said.  |p120GREAT  DEAL of the business was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most irksome that Jack Rhyce could remember . His hours with the Asia Friendship League had a fatuousquality that demanded every bit of his patience in order to fall into the mood of the dedicated people in the Friendship office , and still not miss a trick . He could not tell , in the space of a day , exactly how dedicated all of them were . He could get only a general picture in his mind , yet he was reasonably sure that most of them had honest intentions and felt that they were engaged in a great work . His thoughts went back a dozen times that day to the briefing the Chief had given him in Washington , on the great American strength and weakness  --  the persistentbelief that good will and good fellowship could conquer everything . He wished that he could make up his mind as to whether or not Mr. Harry Pender honestly shared this viewpoint , but he had to set down the whole Pender problem as unfinished business . Mr. Pender made himself so hospitable and charming that no time was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very , very careful , until he had told Bill Gibson his ideas . It was a time to be naive and to convey emphatically the utter harmlessness of himself and Ruth Bogart . It was a time to be enthusiastic but dumb , in an openhanded way . It was also a time to show by a series of skillful shadings a picture of growing attachment be/tween himself and Miss Bogart  --  one of those half-furtive , halffleetingromances between two well-meaning people that burgeonedmore rapidly in the Orient than anywhere else . All these details had kept jack Rhyce very busy . " Of course this is only a very quick fill-in , " Mr. Pender kept saying . " You ca n't really start getting your teeth into anything until Monday , Jack . " Inevitably they had reached a first-name basis in a very few minutes . " I ca n't wait to get the bit in my teeth , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said , " and possibly to be of some help with the wonderful things you are doing here . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , or such lovely and artistic offices . " " You just wait , " Harry Pender said . " These are only temporaryquarters . " Temporary or not , the Asia Friendship League occupied , already , half the floor of a postwar office building in the neighborhood of the Ginza . Mr. Pender , as the head of the japan branch , had a truly beautiful office looking over a large section of thecity , furnished with new Japanese furniture that had beenadapted to the European fashion . The furniture had been designedright in the Friendship League ; desks , chairs , coffee tablesand everything were made by Japanese craftsmen , with authenticJapanese spirit , but also were suited to both Easternersand Westerners . A lot of leading Japanese artists and merchantshad been consulted , and had been generous with their help , Mr.Pender explained , and the result had surely been worth thehours of conferences . All you had to do was to look at the lovelyOriental woods , turned out along chaste , modernistic lines , torealize that here the Friendship League had made an importantp122good-will contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of Tokyo department stores ; several exporters were expressingpractical interest . In fact , it might very well start a new vogue , Mr. Pender said , and this was just a small example of whatthe Asia Friendship League was up to . The League 's motto might in one word be termed Interest . Mr. Pender did not mean financialinterest , but an honest interest in the other fellow out here in the East . Well , this interest was now flowing in all sorts of directions . There was a group in the office , for example , studyingthe new Japanese films . Then there was the sports group . And this afternoon , as Mr. Pender had said , there would be a panel discussion on writing in the conference auditorium . One of the Foundation 's own girls , Miss Kettlebark , was going to deliver a lecture to some young Japanese writers on the American novel . It was amazing , Mr. Pender said , how eager these intellectualswere for American culture . Just wait  --  the auditorium hall would be filled half an hour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Pender said , to give a full runoverof all the projects , but there was one which was a particular pet of his  --  the Friendly Pen Pals . Up to this point Jack Rhyce had listened brightly , but now his interest quickened . " What 's that again , Harry ? " he asked . " Well , it 's an idea that is purely my own , " Mr. Pender said , and I hope you 'll play it up big in your report , jack . You 've heard of Pen Pals in the States and Europe ? Well , it just came over me  --  why not do it here ? Why not get a lot of these Japanese kids in school and the universities to swap ideas and news with their own age groups back home ? It would seem to me to be the very essence of the cultural interchange we 're looking for , and it 's working already . You 'd be surprised . "  |p123Mr  . Harry Pender was watching him expectantly when he finished , seemingly waiting for pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . He was beginning to wonder how he had overlooked Mr. Pender in his research back in the states . The data might be in his notes 4t the hotel , but he could not remember the name or description , and he could not see how the Chief had overlooked him either . The idea of Pen Pals was original , and could form the basis of an excellent messagecenter . " There 's only one thing I do n't get , " Jack Rhyce said . " I do n't exactly see how they write to each other without a common lan-guage . " " That 's right , Jack . That 's the difficulty , " Mr. Pender said . " I began playing around with that problem just as soon as I took over the center here , and then it came over me , just a week or two ago  --  why not set up a translation post right here in the League  --  just an informal unscrambling of the Tower of Babel , and translate the kids ' letters ? It 's not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the number of Japanese around who can read or write English  --  and there 's unemploym , . nt for a lot of intelligentsia . The translation center kills two birds with one stone . We have two big rooms now . Would you like to see them ? " Mr. Pender pushed back his chair , but Jack Rhyce shook his head . It was better not to be overcurious , and besides , Bill Gibsonknew the ground . Bill could never have missed the FriendshipLeague for a moment , or this new man who was running it , and Bill would give the orders . " Thanks , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said . " I would be fascinated to see this project next week because I can begin to see already whatp124a real thought there is behind it . But right now , how about some more on the organization 's setup , before I go after the details ? " Mr. Pender nodded . " I think you 're very wise , Jack , " he said . " Take the whole thing slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning Monday . Of course , our basic trouble as I see it is getting personnel out here who are imbued with the right ideas in the social sense . .. " Harry Pender was a good , fast talker when he discussed the problem of personnel . As Jack Rhyce listened , occasionally noddingin agreement when a cogent point was made , he constantly made mental notes of Mr. Pender 's facial expressions and mannerisms . The type was familiar , the intellectual , professorial features , the pale skin , the brown eyes , the receding hair line . There was a fine photographic collection back in Washington of all known people in the business , and Jack Rhyce racked his memory for photographs of the Pender type , but he could make no identification . The trouble with the business recently was that new faces and new talents were continually appearing , and the photograph files were getting a year or two behind the contemporaryparade . He glanced across the office at Ruth Bogart . " You 're getting full notes on this , are n't you , Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " It 's very fascinating , Mr. Pender . " His one anxiety was not to make a mistake , which might disturbthe picture . That was one of the hardest things to learn  --  to keep things quiet . It was late in the afternoon when entirely by accident Jack Rhyce picked up another piece of information that interestedp125him . They had made a tour of the offices while Mr. Pender poured forth facts . The man , Jack Rhyce was thinking , must have been at some time the recipient of a Ph.D . degree , and he must have worked as an instructor , presumably in sociologyin some college in the States ; there was a depth and charm to his voice that fitted well with the U.S.O. Song Caravan . " You see , " Mr. Pender was saying , " this job here is a real challenge to me , Jack . I do n't know why Chas . Harrington thought I was suitable for it . There I was , just running our settlementhouse at Pnompenh not six weeks ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected me for Tokyo . It 's a big jump from a little settlement house in a onehorsetown to a place like this . " " Pnompenh , " Jack Rhyce said slowly . " I do n't think I 've ever heard of Pnompenh . " It was not true , what he had said , but this was not a time to be bright . " I do n't blame you , " Mr. Pender said . " It 's in Cambodia , and not many people get there now ; but the Cambodians ar " very lovable people . " It was also an excellent place from which to communicate with China , but it was never wise to appear too interested . Jack Rhyce glanced unobtrusively at his wrist watch . " This has been a very full and fascinating day , Harry , " he said , " and I ca n't be too grateful to you for giving us all this time . But now maybe Ruth and I had better leave you and call things off until Monday , or else we 'll lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? " " Oh , do n't do that , " Mr. Pender said . " Why do n't we all gop126to a real Japanese restaurant for supper , and see night life in Tokyo ? " Jack Rhyce glanced at Ruth Bogart and shook his head . " Let 's make it sometime next week , " he said . " I think Ruth 's still tired from the trip . Are n't you , Ruth ? " " Well , yes , " she said . " I am a little , jack . " " I 'll just take her for a walk along the Ginza , " Jack Rhyce said . " I can find my way all right , thanks , Harry . I 'm curious to see the Ginza . It was quite a shambles back in ' 47 . " Mr. Pender smiled at them as they moved toward his office door . " You wo n't recognize it now , " he said . " It 's everything it used to be , and more so . Well  --  " his smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , but come back to school on Mon-day . " The offices of the Friendship League had been air-conditioned , so that the heat on the street outside made one catch one 's breath . " That office and that damned Aloha shirt , " she said . " It was a fresh one since yesterday , " he told her . " The fishwere red yesterday . They were blue today . Did you notice ? " " Oh , yes , " she said . " I 'm a dumb girl , but I noticed quite alot besides the fish . " " How much else ? " he asked . " Enough to know we 'd better be careful , " she told him . " That 's why we 're walking down the Ginza , " he said . " If anyone 's tailing us . . . I agree , we 'll have to be damn careful . " Every large city in the world was bound to have a characteristicstreet or square , and Jack Rhyce had seen enough of thesep127to make intelligent comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vital of them all ; it best expressed the Geist  --  he had to use a German word  --  of the people who had made it , although it was not a beautiful street , any more than Broadway was beautiful . The only civic decoration connected with it were the willows on either side of the thoroughfare that were peculiar to the Ginza district . He did not know what they symbolized . Perhaps they were supposed to illustrate the old saying of the suppletree bending before the wind , and perhaps they delivered a quiet , reassuring message of patience and of waiting to the crowds that thronged past them . It was a tawdry street , but very gay , with all the resilience and adaptability of its sidewalk trees . There were huge department stores , and smaller shops filled with garish , highly colored Japanese goods . There were motion picture houses displaying the latest Hollywood films as well as Japanese-made pictures . There were beer halls , cabarets and billboards , jewelry and cultured pearls . There was something for everyone on the Ginza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with a Western mining town , the whole combination was a tribute to the indomitable spirit of a people anxious to be in the front rank of what was perhaps erroneouslyknown as progress . The startling vigor of Japan was reflected in the burgeoning of manufactured articles that ran from celluloid and plastic toys up to vacuum cleaners and electricrefrigerators . And where was Japan going to sell this glitteringand sometimes meretricious output ? This was one of the world 's new , restive questions , and the world 's future might be hanging on the answer . The motion picture houses , the beer halls and the cabarets with their beckoning invitations in Englishalso showed the versatility of Japan . It was too early for thep128neon signs ; , but once they were turned on , the Ginza would be another Broadway , a center of national aspirations . Actually it was more significant than New York 's Broadway of the present , because Broadway was tired , worldly-wise and cynical , whereas the Ginza was full of a naive , unfaltering hope . Now and then you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese features and the voices speaking a strange tongs e , and the Japanese characters above the shops . " It 's a little spooky here , is n't it ? " Ruth Bogart said . " How do you mean ? " he asked . " There are n't spooks around at four in the afternoon . " " I mean , it 's half home , and half not , " Ruth Bogart said . " I wonder whether the Japanese feel any more at home here than we do . " It was one of those interesting thoughts that could never be answered , and it showed that she was not anybody 's fool . The truth was , he was thinking , he was growing too interested in her reactions , but it was pleasant to turn his attention to her after a difficult day . " The beer halls are air-conditioned , " he said . " Would you like to go in and have some beer and listen to some jazz ? " " No , thanks , " she answered . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see the show . It is n't like Piccadilly , is it ? " " No , " he said , " it is n't like anywhere else . Would you like some raw fish and rice ? There must be some good suchi places down the side streets . " " Not raw fish , " she said , " and do n't try to be an informative guide using words for local color . To hell with the suchi places . Let 's just walk along . "  | " I could show you quite a lot if I wanted to use the language , " he said . " I 'd say we 're seeing enough the way it is , " she said . " I would n't say we had a tail on us . Would you ? " " No , " he said . " I would n't . Between us we should have spottedone by now . " She smiled at him , and he smiled back because he shared her temporary relief . " Then let 's go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " And you can make eyes at me in front of the bar boys and the barflies , just to build the cover , darling  --  just to build the cover . They have an air-conditioned bar at the hotel . Did you know it ? " " We 'll go there pretty soon , " he said , " but there 's one place I 'd like to take you first . It 's quite a distance , but we can get a taxi . " " Oh , no , " she said , " not any more sights today . I never did like sights . " " It wo n't take long , " he told her , " and perhaps we can pick up some ideas . " Along the Ginza it was simple enough to find a taxi driver who could speak a little English . " Street with all the bookstores , " Jack Rhyce said . He took a paper from his pocket and pretended to read the name of the district from it , with a clumsy pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the cab had started on its way . " For heaven 's sake , why bookstores ? " " You 'll be surprised , " he said , " at how many people are readingin Japan . "  |p130There  were districts in every city where dealers in new and secondhand books congregated , but few were larger than the book street in Tokyo . The bookshops extended for block after block , and , like the Ginza , they offered a little bit of everything . The wide-open doorways leading to the brightly lighted interiorsdisplayed stacks of new paper-backed editions , translations from all over the world , the classical literature of Japan , and current fiction . Also older works were displayed in the show windows  --  books of art , court ceremonial and religious writings  --  but the books in English were more provocative than any . There was , for instance , in one shop window , a handsome set of leather volumes on the birds of northern Britain , published some years before Perry had anchored off Japan ; an early set of the Waverley novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book on navigation dated 181o ; and The Parent 's Assistant by Maria Edgeworth . These timeworn volumes each had its untold and unknownstory of its ending in an Oriental bookstall . You could not help wondering who had first brought them to Japan . Had they been owned once by someone in the British Embassy , or by an American missionary , or had they come from the library of a once rich Japanese , impoverished by the war ? No one would ever know the answer any more than one could guess who would eventually read them . The past , the present and the future were all implicit in the bookstores . Most of them were filled with customers , many of whom were reading as much of a volume as possible in the hope of getting the gist of it before they had to buy , but no one disturbed these furtive readers . No one interrupted Ruth Bogart or Jack Rhyce either , as they moved from shop to shop . The displays of periodicalswere what interested him most , particularly the largep131numbers that dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some in English , some in Japanese  --  were crude but effective projections of American formats . Except for some scurrilouspictures of Uncle Sam and heavily armed gentlemen with dollar signs on their waistcoats who whipped starving workers into factories , everyone was happy in the pictures . Fat Chinese peasants were smilingly learning to read . Farmers were proudly operating tractors . Soldiers carrying the Freedom Flag of the Hammer and Sickle gave candy to little children . " You see , " he said , " how it rounds out the picture of the day ? " " Yes , naturally I see , " she said , taking his arm and pressing iturgently . " But let 's go . We should n't have come here . " " Why not ? " he asked her . " What 's the hurry ? " " Buy some cheap American magazine , " she said , " and get out of here . " He did not ask her again what the matter was until they stood on the curb waving to a taxi . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing queer in any of those shops . " She shook her head impatiently . " No , " she said , " but we are . We were the only foreigners and everyone remembers foreigners . Where would you keep a lookoutfor new operators ? Put yourself in their position , Jack . " He felt deeply mortified that he had not thought of her point himself . Too many small mistakes too often added up to somethingfatal , and there was no way of knowing how great a marginof error they possessed . A taxi had halted . " There are some people looking at us , " she said . " What sort ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " she answered . " Little men . "  | " But , darling , " he said , and he laughed loudly . Then he put his arm through hers and took her hand . At least he could leave the impression of love and dalliance if anyone was watching . " This country is full of little men . Insufficient food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is two feet longer than that of his opposite number in Europe . Did you know that ? " " No , " she said . " How fascinating ! " But she leaned against him and laughed up at him applaudingly . When they were in the taxicab he put his arm around her . As Bill Gibson had said , there was safety in sex . They had only been two people in love looking for a copy of Hollywood True Romances . " Oh , Jack , " she said , and she giggled . The taxi driver , if anyone asked him , would remember . " Honey , " he said , " I 'll get you a nice cool drink in that nice cool bar . Frankly , I ca n't wait . " But she had been right . He had been a fool to be examining Red literature in Tokyo . The bar of the Imperial Hotel was aggressively modern and so over-air-conditioned that Jack Rhyce felt for a moment that they were locked inside a refrigerator . They sat next to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden containing a marble bust of an elderly man in the top half of a frock coat . Nearly all the tables were filled , some with prosperousJapanese businessmen , but most with rather weary-looking Europeans who appeared as peculiarly assorted as the English books they had seen exposed for sale . People were looking at them with the friendly curiosity with which foreigners in the Orient regard new strangers . There was nothing professional about anyone there , nothing technically disturbing . It was be/coming easier and easier to appear conspicuously interested in Ruth Bogart . " What would you like , sweet ? " he asked , when the bar boy came to the table . " Scotch on the rocks , darling , " she said . They gazed at each other fatuously for a while after the bar boy left , and then they both began to laugh , and it was the first time in several weeks that he had been genuinely amused . " Did you know , sweet , " he said , " that rats are very adaptable creatures ? " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes you think of rats ? " " The extreme coldness of this room , " he said . " Once when I was crossing the ocean , the ship 's captain asked me to a cocktail party . Have you ever been to a ship 's captain 's cocktail party ? " " Yes , darling , " she said . " That 's one reason why I travel by air . " " Well , this was a very nice ship 's captain , " Jack Rhyce said , " and he told an anecdote about a rat . It seems that this rat was locked up by mistake in the ship 's refrigerator . He stayed there for four weeks and he did n't freeze to death . When they caught him he had a coat as heavy as mink . That 's why I say rats are adaptable . " " Is there any moral to that story ? " she asked . " No , " he said , " no . It 's just an off-the-record story . " " Well , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever told to date . " " Yes , " he said , " that 's so . I 'm afraid you 're a bad influence on me. "  | " I hope I am , " she said . " I really do , and I hope you 'll tell some more . He realized that he was happy , and happiness was such a rare sensation that he was suspicious of it , but the more he examined his mood , the more certain he was that it was genuine . He could discover no particular reason for it , and he did not particularly care . He only knew that it was something that made the whole day worth while . " You know , " he said , " I think you 're a pretty clever girl . " " Why , thanks a lot , " she said . " Coming from you , I must be . " The mood had not left him yet . He could even enjoy looking at the bust of the old man in the garden . " In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You were right about those bookstores . " " I like to have you wrong sometimes , " she said . " It shows that maybe you are human . " " Why , thanks a lot , " he said , " but believe me , it 's better not to be . " She smiled at him , ironically , but very pleasantly . " You remind me of a poem of Whittier 's , " she said . " What poem ? " he asked . " About the boy and the girl at the schoolhouse , " she said . " I 'm sorry that I spelt the word : I hate to go above you , because , '  --  the brown eyes lower f ell ,  --  Because , you see , I love you ! ' " " Yes , " he said , " but I do n't like what comes later . Dear girl ! the grasses on her grave Have forty years been growing . " " I do n't like that either , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But even so , nothing changed his mood. 135STOPOVER : TOKYO " You know , " he said , " I do n't see why we should n't have a nice time going there tomorrow . " When she smiled at him again , it was exactly as though they were on the outside. "  --  ase , " she said , " please let 's , Jack . "  |p136JACK  RHYCE glanced at his wrist watch as they stood beneath the porte-cochere of the Imperial Hotel . The time was 9:05 exactly . They had brought box luncheons , and they could make a leisurely trip , spending the whole day if they liked . Mr. Moto had done very well with the car . It was a vintage Buick limousine , with the chauffeur 's seat separated by glass from the owner 's . " Thirty thousand yen to keep for week end , " Mr. Moto said . " Me , automobile , and glass for privacy , everything . It is not too expensive , I hope . " " Oh , no , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything 's just swell , and here are some yens on account  --  just so you 'll know I 've got them , Mr. Moto . " He laughed heartily , and Mr. Moto laughed back . There was one good thing about the business . Money was never an obstacle , and nobody audited expense accounts if you happened to get home . Their suitcases were locked in the trunk behind . Everythingwas ready . " All right , " he said , " let 's go "  --  and he smiled at Ruth Bogartaffectionately for the benefit of the doorman . " That is , if you 've remembered everything , sweet ? " " Silly , " she said . " Of course I 've remembered everything . " The mood of the afternoon before was still with him , and hefelt no sensation of tenseness or discomfort . He was sure thatp137they were not being watched or followed , and that they were still in the clear . " By the way , " he said , rolling down the glass partition , " we might stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for the soldiers , I mean . Miss Bogart might like to see it . " She looked at him questioningly , but he was sure that he was right about the temple . His asking to go there established them as sightseers , and for some reason the Japanese felt no resentment at Americans visiting the shrine of their war dead . The pine-shaded area of the temple 's grounds stood in one of Tokyo 's heavily populated districts , making a sharp contrast with the surging traffic on the street outside . " Wait , please , " Jack Rhyce said to Mr. Moto . " We wo n't be long "  --  and Mr. Moto smiled . In plan , the temple was typical of all the shrines of Japan dedicated to the Shinto sect , which was more of a national loyaltythan a religion . The arched stone-lined causeway leading to the red-lacquer pavilions , and also the smaller paths that divergedbeneath the dark pines , had undoubtedly been adapted , like so much Japanese culture , from early Chinese religious structures ; but time had added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely their own . There was a Spartan simplicity in the repression of design , as well as in the repression of the people , mostly elderly , who moved about the grounds , stopping now and then before a pavilion , clapping their hands and bowing their heads in prayer . The ashes of soldiers who had died for the Emperor were preserved there , and where there were not ashes there were names . " I come here , " he said , " because I 'm responsible for several of these names . "  |p138There  was no necessity , he realized , to have given her this explanation . " How many ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " he answered . " Twenty  --  thirty . More , perhaps . You ca n't always tell everything that a machine gun or a hand grenade does . And you see , most of them preferred to die . " They walked back to the car in silence , and he hoped he had taught her something about japan that was both important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city streets had been torn by war , and that every person walking on them had lost some near relation , because the signs of war had almost disappeared , both from Tokyo and the faces of its people . It was valuable to understand that nothing was forgotten . Even during the journey , Jack Rhyce knew that he would never forget the motor ride to Myanoshita . It was one of those unrelated lapses that come into one 's life when least expected , a sudden unalloyed period of beauty that became something more than memory . It was dangerous to feel as he was beginning to about the girl in the car beside him , but as he looked back over that long day he could not experience a single qualm of regret . Actually there had been no need for any , because there was nothing that he or she could have done about anything until they made contact with Bill Gibson at the hotel that night . There was no necessity to think or plan , and no immediate harm in being beguiled ; and besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was part of the cover to be conscious of her nearness and to hope that the car would soon take another curve so that she would lean against him . It was as though they were both on the outside , that day , and it was more of a fact than an illusion . Itp139was a part of his business to know perfumes . The first instant he had met her he knew that she used Guerlain 's and he had identifiedthe variety , but there was nothing technical about the Guerlainany longer . He had immediately recognized her as beautiful , but now everything about her was subjective , not objective any longer , just as it might have been on the outside . The way a draft of air blew a wisp of hair across her forehead was beautiful , and so was the austere perfection of her profile when softenedby a smile , and so were the quick gestures of her strong but delicate hands . A pair of white gloves lay across her lap , but she did not wear them , and she wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip . " It 's just as though we were on the outside , " he said . " Yes , " she answered , " and please let 's keep it that way . " And she did not move away when he took her hand . In a way that ride to Myanoshita had everything . Later he could unroll it in his memory as one did a Chinese scroll painting , which should be seen in parts and never all at once . Their ride took them past the area of heavy industry that surroundedYokohama , then along the sea and finally into the country . Except for the heavy traffic on the roads , the disruptions of the machine age were gone once they reached the country . The thatched farmhouses , the jade-green of the rice plants reflected in the shallow water of the checkerboard squares of the paddies , the bamboo windbreaks , the farmers in their huge straw hats meticulously tending each rice shoot , the jagged mountains in the background were part of an eternal picture of a way of life that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the immense Daibutsu Buddha and the island Eno/shima , with its crowded inns and its shops of seashell ornaments , the scene of the most masterly satire yet written on Japan , The Honorable Picnic . This was a book which had been banned before the war , but was now on sale everywhere . Had the war taught the Japanese to laugh at themselves ? Like all those questions , there was no definite answer , except that the humor of Japan was as detailed and specialized as its ornamental ivories . Nothing that Ruth Bogart said or did was discordant . She had great adaptability , but Jack Rhyce was also sure that they both honestly liked the same things and were impressed by the same details . There were two incidents that day that were more vivid than the rest . The first was the sight of two wounded soldiers , on the path leading to one of the shrines at Kamakura . Each had an artificial hand , and each an artificial leg . They were dressed in well-washed khaki without insignia . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attention and saluted , and he had returned their salute before he recollectedthat he was in civilian clothes . They had spotted him as a soldier , too , and for a second all three of them must have been moving into the past . Now that the war was over , there was a lack of resentment impossible for a Westerner to understand . Then there was the fortuneteller who had his concession just beyond the alms-seeking soldiers , an emaciated elderly man who smiled and beckoned the moment Jack Rhyce and Ruth Bogart betrayed interest . On a stand near him was a miniature redlacquertemple with three small black-and-yellow birds perched in front of it  --  goldfinches , Jack Rhyce believed . He had never been good about birds . But , going back to his early childhood , he remembered tame birds looking just like them that would sing and fly and return to their cage at a whistle . The fortune/teller was clearly used to Americans , because he whipped out from his pocket a typewritten explanation . " Give any bird a fifty-yen folded note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cash box , fly to temple door , ring bell , enter temple , get fortune on folded paper and bring back same . " " It might be worth fifty yen , " Jack said . " Yes , " she said , " but let me pay for it . I want it to be my fortune . " She handed the old man a folded note . He held it in front of one of the birds , and just as the explanation said , the bird took it in its beak and dropped it in a tiny money chest . " Come on , Joe , " the old man chanted , " come on Chollie , go on Joe . " The birds and their owner repeated a pattern that jack Rhyce had seen in nearly every city in the world . That act of fortunetellingmust have dated back to temple necromancy , but here the words were new . They had an unfamiliar ring beneath the hot Japanese sky , telling their tale of lonely American soldiers on leave , back at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Chollie ; come on Joe . " The tiny black and yellow bird cocked its head and its beady eye was remarkably intelligent . It fluttered from its perch to a tiny ladder that led to the temple porch . It pushed a small bell smartly with its beak , and the bell tinkled with a miniature clarity that completely rounded out the illusion . Then the bird disappeared inside the toy temple and emerged carrying a folded bit of paper . Then the bird fluttered back to its perch , and Ruth Bogart took the paper from its beak . " Do n't be afraid to read it , " Jack Rhyce said . " They only have good fortunes here . "  |p142He  had meant to speak lightly , but he was disturbed by her intent look . " Yes , I know it 's rigged , " she said , " but I want it to be true . " The strip of paper resembled one of those fortunes that one used to find as a child inside a snapper at a birthday party . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you were unhappy , " he read , " but you are very happy now . " " That 's true , you know , " she said . " Absolutely true . " " Well , " he told her , " you wanted it to be . " " I do n't have to want it . It 's here , " she said . " And you 're happy too , are n't you ? I mean for just now ? " " Oh , yes , " he said , " I 'm happy . " She laughed . She was watching the outlines of the rock pines against the cloudless sky . " I was afraid you were going to say you were too happy , " she said . " I love it when you 're not careful , and you have n't been all day . " " If you want to know , " he told her , " it 's pleasant for a change . " " There 's only one catch about it , " she said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long , and I want it to be long-term . Would you like it long-term ? " She had said she liked it when he was not too careful  --  and he was not careful then . With her standing close beside him in that place , so far removed from anything that was familiar to either of them , it would have been impossible for him to measure everything he said , and he would have hated himself afterwards if he had done so.  | " Yes , " he said . " You could n't possibly know how much I want it that way . " That was all that either of them said , and it was all that was necessary . They both knew that the moment would be transient , but a weight was lifted from him . He felt a grateful relief that he was alive , but this relief had nothing to do with any of the cruder gratitudes for survival that he had experienced more recently . As it happened , neither of them had time to embroider on what they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , and he was back from the outside to the inside , turning slowly and accurately on his heel . Nothing was ever gained by appearing startled or suspicious . He did not know that Mr. Moto had followed them until then , nor was there any sure way of telling how long Mr. Moto had been behind them or what he might have heard  --  not that what they might have said would have affected any situation . There was nothing harder , Jack Rhyce was thinking , than to tread softly on a graveled walk , and only that single footstep had attracted his attention . " Oh , hello , " Jack Rhyce said . " Have we been staying here too long ? " " Oh , no , " Mr. Moto said , " but there is still a great distance to go , and many things to see . " " All right , " Jack said . He put a slight edge to his words because he wanted to make it clear that he had not approved of that gentle approach . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you in a minute . " When Mr. Moto moved away , Jack Rhyce waited deliberately until the purple suit and tan shoes were a hundred yards in front of them.  | " Have you noticed one queer thing about him today ? " Ruth Bogart asked . " I 've noticed several , " Jack Rhyce said . " Which one did you notice ? " " He said he was a guide , " she said , " but all day long he has n't tried to explain one single thing to us . Did you ever see a guide like that ? " " That 's right , " he said , " but he 's an A-i driver . He has to be , with all the crazy driving on these roads . " It was one of the few moments when they were both inside that day . " You 're right about his being in the business , " she said . " He was once , anyway , " he answered . " Do you think he knows what we are ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " We 'll know better when we see Bill tonight . Let 's still try to be happy . I enjoy makingthe effort , as long as you do , too . " They had been in no hurry , and there were long cool shadows across the road as they began to climb into the hills . The trees of the carefully tended forests that had replaced the rice farms in the landscape were the ginkgo , the feathery cryptomeria , trees that looked out of place when in a Western land , but fitted perfectlyinto the Japanese landscape . They would be at the hotel at half-past five or six . There were hot springs at the hotel , and a swimming pool , he told her . The rooms were very comfortable , and the food and service were very good . " But I 'd rather stay at a Japanese inn , " he said . " I 'll take you to one sometime . "  | " I 'd like it , " she said , but he knew she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Jack , will you promise me something ? " " Promise what ? " he asked . " Do n't be so cagey , " she said . " If we get out of this , let 's try to live on the outside . And promise me you 'll get out of the businessif I do n't come back . " " Listen , " he said , " have you got a hunch about something , Ruth ? " " No , " she said , " no . But I 'd like to have you promise before it gets you , jack . " " Let 's talk about it later , " he said , " but I 'm glad you like me that much . " " Yes , I like you that much , " she said . It must have been at that moment that the peacefulness of the day ended . It was time to drop a curtain on the day and think about the evening , and it was time to heed the warning of commonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Moto 's head . The man 's age , he was thinking again , was about fifty , but his reflexes were still excellent , and his driving on the switch-back turns of the mountainous road superb . Actually Jack Rhyce had not bothered to see whether the car was wired for sound , because nothing they had said was of any importance except those last speeches , but even a microphone would hardly have carried above the outside noises of the traffic on the heavily traveled road . He heard her laugh beside him . " Do n't worry , " she said . " The car 's all clean . " If she said so , she was correct , and it was not necessary to ask how she knew , or how she had made the opportunity to find out.  |p146THE  TOWN was on a slope of the winding road that led to Lake Hakone and , farther , toward the sacred Mount Fuji . The hot springs and the scenery had made it a resort for a great many years , patronized by the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had owned houses there ; and the Japanese inns were excellent . The hotel to which they drove had been designed as a concession to European tastes , long before the war ; time , plus the imagination of its proprietors , had given it an exotic Eurasian charm . Its grounds on the mountain slope were watered by rills from natural springs that made a continuedmerry sound of running water . The season was too late for the azaleas and some of the exotic blooms , but the hotel gardens were still very beautiful . The Japanese had ancient ways with plants and flowers which were different from those of other gardeners . They lavished a watchful care and patience on every shrub and even on the surrounding trees , so that everything , even if seemingly wild , was actually in order , even down to the arrangements of wind- and waterworn rocks . The spirit conveyed by the hotel was agreeable . It had frankly been designed as a place for a happy holiday , and it had brought peace and happiness to many travelers . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , stiff with formal furniture , reminded him that even the most adaptable Japanese had trouble in selecting suitable assortmentsp147of Western chairs , tables and carpets . Yet in spite of a cleavage in taste that was hard to bridge , on the whole the hotel had succeeded ; the reason for its success might have been its rambling informality , growing from a profusion of halls , staircases , outsidegalleries and connecting ells that had happy names in Englishwith an Oriental lilt  --  Plum Blossom Cottage , Cozy Nook , The Peach Bloom . Due to the crowded week end , the parking spaces along the driveway were already filled with the cars of United States naval and air force personnel , and bellboys clad in white ducks were very busy with the luggage . The day was still warm but the air was cooler and fresher than it had been in Tokyo . Mr. Moto was speaking authoritatively to the Japanese concierge , and Jack Rhyce was contented to hear him say that his passengers were good people who would appreciate attention . " I will take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will call later for orders and to see if all is right . " " You do n't have to until tomorrow , " Jack Rhyce told him . " It 's been a very fine day , and thanks a lot . " The sunlight had grown softer and the shadows longer . He did not need to consult his wrist watch to know it was somewhatbefore six , but there was still plenty of time before dark to stroll about the grounds and to locate the cottage called ChrysanthemumRest , where Bill Gibson would be staying . Nevertheless , he was afraid it would take more time than was available to be as familiar as he would wish to be with the halls and connectingpassages of the rambling buildings . " It 's a mixed-up place , is n't it ? " Ruth Bogart said , as they followed the boy with their bags . Being built on the side of a hill , the hotel had several levels . They were passing through an arcadep148lined with display cases of silks , lacquer , ivories and porcelains , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAIN BAR and DINING ROOM . " Yes , " he said , " this would be quite a place to play cops and robbers in , would n't it ? " He was ashamed of his lack of caution the instant he said it , but it was not such a bad estimate of the situation . There were any number of places where you could lose yourself , and too many exits and entrances for one ever to be at ease . As Bill Gibson had said , a room had been reserved for them , very comfortable , as the clerk anxiously pointed out , with a bath , in a quiet section of the hotel known as Cozy Nook . Jack Rhyce did not know exactly what had been said or through whom the reservation had been made , but he found the solicitudeof the clerk disturbing . Still , he only had to tell himself that nobody knew his business better than Bill Gibson in order to set his own mind at rest . When they followed the boy with their luggage along further passageways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of years of practice in many places , the ground plan of this building was too much for him , and he greatly disliked the sensation of not being oriented . In consequence , his first task , he told himself , would be to get entrances and exits straight . Also the friendly smiles of the desk clerks had brought home to him again the necessity for cover , since the management seemed to be so clearly aware that he and Ruth Bogart had arrived for an off-the-record week end . Although this could not have struck the hotel staff as unusual for two Americans , it was of the utmost importance to keep up the illusion . And now , facing the prospect , Jack Rhyce encountered inp149himself an embarrassment that made him very formal , especially when the boy opened the door to a spacious double bedroom . There was a io per cent service charge , about which Japanesehotel employees were far more conscientious than their European counterparts , but still he gave a liberal tip and spoke enthusiastically as the boy backed out , bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , dear ? " he asked . " I think perhaps I 'd better take the bed by the doorway , do n't you ? " It did not help his sense of uneasiness to find that she was laughing at him . " And if you want to bathe or anything , " he said , " I 'll go out for half an hour and stroll around . The hot water comes directly from a hot spring , I believe , in case you 'd like to know . " " Listen , " she said , " you 've traveled around considerably , have n't you ? Have n't you ever been alone in a hotel bedroom with a girl before ? " " Well , yes , " he said , " occasionally , now you ask me , but not exactly in this way , Ruth . " " Well , " she said , " I do n't see such a great difference and do n't take it so seriously , for heaven 's sake , even if your father was a missionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better , too . Do you snore , darling ? " " No , " he told her , and he lowered his voice , " you ought to know I do n't ; not in this business , Ruth . " She tossed her suitcase on the bed next the wall and snapped it open . The easy way that she moved her luggage showed that she was much stronger than she looked . " For heaven 's sake , " she said , but she lowered her voice just as carefully as he had , " the more we forget the business while we'rep150in here , the better . Darling , are n't you going to give me a kiss or anything , after you 've brought me all this way ? " She raised her voice when she asked that last question and looked at him meaningly . " Why , dear , " he said , " I 've been waiting for this for hours . " " Oh , darling , " she said , and then she whispered , " there 's someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this room . " His first instinct was to tiptoe to the door and snatch it open , but she held him and shook her head . " No , no , " she whispered , " maybe it is n't anything , but we 'd better act damned silly . I think this place is spooky , Jack . " She was right about the room . There was a transom above the door and he especially disliked transoms . Two windows at the foot of the twin beds , both of them open now , looked over the carefully tended grounds at the rear of the hotel . The third window in the bathroom with ground glass obviously opened on the corridor , and now that the bathroom door was open , a sound of footsteps made a rhythmic beat along the corridor 's jute carpet . They were the staccato steps of an Oriental , one of the hotel boys , he was very certain . Nevertheless , he quickly closed the bathroom door . " Thanks , " he said . " I seem to be losing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a mistake , he realized immediately , to have said such a thing out loud . He believed in holding a positive thought ; as soon as one became overworried and overanxious , accidents frequentlyoccurred . He stepped to the open window , examined the shades and curtains and then made a thorough inventory of thep151bedroom , which would have been unusually attractive under other circumstances . The Japanese prints on the wall seemed surprisinglygood , although he was not a connoisseur of that sort of thing : pictures of strange bent-kneed men with staffs and heavy burdens on their backs , climbing mountains , crossing narrowarchedbridges , or laboring on farmsteads . The curtains that could be drawn before the windows were of heavy cotton , green and yellow with the bamboo motif so favored by Japanese textiledesigners . The twin beds with comfortable box-spring mattresseswere in simple European taste , matching the large mirrored bureau and the taller dresser . Each was covered with a yellowish green spread of raw silk , and the walls had a matchinggreenish tint . Whoever had decorated the room had good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock on the door was an old and clumsy contraption which any well-trained operator could pick in a matter of seconds . The bathroom was commodious , and the tub , made out of marble slabs , gave it an old-fashioned charm . Ruth Bogart had turned on the bathtub taps and the noise of the running water made a cheerful sound . " I suppose we 'll have to look nice but informal , " she said , " if we 're going to that dance . " She was taking out clothing from her neatly packed bag . " I 'll wear my light green silk . " " Better put on the dark green or a dark blue if you have it , " he told her . " Remember , we are going to go outside . " " Right . I forgot , " she said . " I wonder whether Gibson 's got here yet . " " That 's his problem , " he told her . " I 'm going out to walk around while you take your bath . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " and I wish you 'd put on something else besides that seersucker suit . " " I 'll put on my blue one tonight , " he said , " but have n't you noticed that everyone who does kind things for backward peoplescustomarily wears a seersucker suit ? " " Oh , dear , " she said , and she smiled at him . " I wish we were really staying here and that there could be just two people in this room instead of four . I 'm sick of split personalities . " She was still unpacking and hanging things in the bedroom closet as though they were going to stay there for an indefinite period . Her confident unpacking and the running water in the bath contrived to make a new bond in their relationship . The voices from the hotel guests came gaily through the open windowsfrom the grounds outside . People were calling to each other at the swimming pool ; army and navy mothers called to their children , and single men far away from home talked to their sweethearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anywhere , both moral and amoral , but agreeably enough the voices all sounded happy . Up by the swimming pool someone was singing , and then in the distance someone began whistling a tune that made Jack look at Ruth Bogart . Both their faces had assumed their old watchful look because it was the tune they had last heard before the break of day at Wake Island . You can not see in gay Paree , in London or in Cork ! The queens you 'll meet on any street in old New York . " Well , well , " he said softly , " our old favorite , is n't it ? " There was no reason , his common sense told him , to be undulystartled . The melodies from The Red Mill were alwaysp153cropping up on modern records , and they were good , despite the lapse of time . " It 's no favorite of mine , " she said . " I told you this place was spooky . " There was no one outside whom he recognized  --  only a stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool to dress for dinner . " Well , " he said , " go ahead and take your bath . I 'd better go down there and see what I can see . " She shook her head emphatically . " I 'm not going to stay here alone , " she said . " I 'll go right down with you , and go dirty . That damn song . Frankly , it makes me frightened . " They walked around the grounds for a while , arm in arm , hanging on each other 's words , laughing at each other 's jests . They walked up the hill to the swimming pool , which was almostdeserted now that the sun was low . They observed the empty tennis courts and the hotel greenhouses with their potted azaleas and their cyclamen and fuchsias . They stood in the shade of a giant cryptomeria which must have been at least four hundredyears old . They wandered heedlessly past Chrysanthemum Rest  --  a small cottage , which sure enough was not much more than a hundred and fifty feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked a better place for a private conversationbecause , as he had said , the noise of the orchestra would drown out anything else . Then they stopped at the fish pond and watched children feeding bread crumbs to the giant goldfish . " You know , " she said , " I would n't mind being a fish myself , right now . No wonder they live a hundred years . "  | " Do n't wish that , sweet , " he said loudly enough so that everyonecould hear , because there was safety in sex . " Just compromiseand be a mermaid . " " All right , if you say so , " she answered , " you old seadog , you . " He gave an involuntary shudder at her remark , but still , the cover was not so bad as he thought it was going to be. " just do n't overplay , " he whispered to her amorously . " All right , " she said , " you old seadog , you . " And then she laughed . There was reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had noticed nothing out of the ordinary . All they saw were happy people , young , carefree , many of them handsome , all concernedonly with each other . It was very much like another musicalcomedy song  --  " Love Is Sweeping the Country "  --  at that kindly hotel at sunset . " Hold my hand , " she said . " It looks better , and now maybe we 'd better go up and get ready for dinner . " " Let 's go to that place called the Main Bar , " he said . " We have n't seen it , and there may be something new there . " The Main Bar was on the hotel 's lower level . The inspiration for its decoration must have been derived from foreign influenceclose to the turn of the century , because it had the earmarksof another happier age , and its spiritual quality , if such a thing could be attributed to a bar , was remarkable close to the music of Victor Herbert . Its dark woodwork was like the OldNew York where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able chairs and tables were not crowded too closely together . The bar itself , with its magnificent array of glass , was almost as long and hospitable as the now mythical bar in Shanghai that wasp155once believed to be the longest bar in the world . The only concessionto a changing world lay in the new bar stools , those importationsfrom the French bistro that had reached America at the end of Prohibition . A dozen happy couples , now that the dinner hour was approaching , were taking over the tables in groups of fours and twos , and several unaccompanied men were seated at the bar . Still , the room was large enough so that it gave a quiet , half-empty impression ; the voices of its patrons were partially absorbed by its spaciousness . " It 's awfully Gothic , is n't it ? " she said . " Like a church . " " I 'm not carried away by the resemblance , " he told her . He beckoned to a waiter . " Would you like a gin and tonic , dear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which the whole room was visible . He was already giving the people a mental screening even while he was thinking that he was tired of this sort of watchful analysis . " Scotch and water , " she answered , " and I hope we can get bathed and ready for dinner pretty soon . Everybody here looks very cool and comfortable , and though you 're smarter than I am , I ca n't locate any types . " " Do n't try too hard . Do n't forget we 're in love , " he said . He leaned back and sipped his drink . She was right that there was no one who showed interesting signs . If it had not been for that tune , he would have believed that the place was wholly antiseptic , and of course Bill Gibson must have thought so , too , or he would not have named it as a contact point . " That 's right , " she said . " I 've got to keep remembering . You look handsomer tonight than you did yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd like it , at any rate , if you could get your seersucker suit pressed . "  | " Oh , do n't say that , " he told her . " It makes me look informal , feeble and good-natured . Nobody cares what happens to a man in a seersucker suit . " " I care at the moment , " she said , " if only because I do n't want to be left alone in this rat-race . Oh , Jack ! Look across the room . " His glance followed hers to the entrance by the bar . " Well , well , " he said ; " now things are looking up . " He had to admit that he felt as Livingstone and Stanley must have when they encountered each other in the interior of Africa . At least things were moving according to plan , because Bill Gibsonhad entered the room , and there was no mistaking what Bill was . He was a tired , middle-aged American exporter from Tokyo out for a good time over the week end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a good time at the hotel on previous occasions because he waved to a group at one table and sat down with a couple at another , putting his arm playfully around the girl 's waist . " Where 's Dorothy ? " they heard him say . " Why did n't you bring Dorothy ? " No one in the business was more consummate than Bill Gibson . In fact , his appearance gave Jack Rhyce a slight spasm of professional envy . Bill 's loud Aloha shirt was art . The paunchy roll of his walk and the slump of his shoulders were beautiful . He sauntered in an aimless way about the room , just as a lonely man with a few drinks should . He walked close by the table where Jack and Ruth Bogart sat , and Jack was exasperated by the obviousness of the contact . Bill was his senior in the business , but that was no reason to treat his junior like an amateur with such a clumsy check-in . For a second Jack thought he might be given some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed the table , no warning gesture , no signal of anxiety . The truth was that Bill Gibson could not have noticed anything off color either , or he would not have moved so carelessly . His face was flushed as though he had been in the sun by the swimming pool . His jowls had their old purplish tinge , his eyes their deceptive glazed expression . He passed their table and ambled to the bar , hoisted himself on one of the stools ; Jack heard him calling happily : " Another Scotch and soda , and make it a double this time , Boy-san . " " Listen , " Ruth Bogart said , " school 's out now , is n't it ? Ca n't we please go up and get a bath ? " " You go ahead , " Jack Rhyce said . " Maybe I ought to stick around here a few minutes . " " No , " she answered . " All those corridors ... I wo n't go up there alone . " " Now , listen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cough in a carload here . " And then he checked himself , and his voice dropped to a whisper . " Fasten your seat belt , " he whispered , " and for God 's sake let 's be natural . Boy ! " He raised his voice and waved to a bar waiter . " Two more , please . You 'll have another , wo n't you , dear ? " " Oh , " she said , " yes , if you 'd honestly like me to get tight , darling . "  |p158SHE  was a good girl , back in the act again . She had glanced for only a fraction of a second at the doorway to the bar , but the instant had been long enough for her to see what he had seen . There was no mistaking the sandy hair , the bushy eyebrows , the clear-eyed glance , the easy walk , the lazily swinging arms , and the characteristic half bend of the fingers of the man who had just entered . Once you had seen Big Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers , army issue , and he , too , wore an Aloha shirt , and even in that moment of impact Jack Rhyce made a mental note that the shirt had a fish design similar to the shirt of Mr. Harry Fender at the Asia Friendship League . The fish , " she whispered . " Yes , " he answered . " For God 's sake let 's be natural . ' .. You look awfully sweet tonight , honey . " After all , there were plenty of fish designs on plenty of Aloha shirts , but still there was the coincidence . He saw Bill Gibson at the bar tossing off his double Scotch and soda . Bill had the descriptionand Bill never missed anything . He must have seen , of course ; he and jack Rhyce must both have shared the same surprise and consternation , and also the same exalted sense you always had when the game was getting hot  --  because anything might happen now , anything , or nothing . It was unsafe to relyp159on intuition , and just as unsafe to discount it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jack Rhyce 's reasoning . The coincidences had gone so far that there was scarcely a reasonable doubt any longer that the man was Big Ben . His appearanceat the hotel at just this time confirmed the fact . Bill Gibson 's mind must have been moving in the same channels , but he continued drinking his whisky without a glance at the doorway . After all , there was nothing else to do . There was only one question hanging in the air , unanswered by the voices around them : How much did Big Ben know ? Did he know who Bill Gibson was ? Did he know who they were ? There was no immediateanswer to those questions , but very soon there was bound to be one . There was bound to be because , as Big Ben stood by the door , their glances met , and Jack saw that he had recognized them . He could feel it in the nerves of his neck before his reason confirmed the fact . The light was on Big Ben and as far as Jack could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile . Honest pleasure rippled over it . The corners of the wide , expressive mouth turned upward , yet that was not all . Big Ben waved to them from across the room . Jack Rhyce waved back and beckoned , at the same time lifting his gin and tonic glass . " Darling , " he said loudly , " just look who 's coming over ! Ships that pass in the night , darling ! " And then he lowered his voice , " Do n't forget , for God 's sake , that we 're in love . " Big Ben sauntered toward them . Jack did not like to think that the physical sensation he experienced was one of fear ; in fact , he was fairly convinced that it was not . It was rather a state of intense warning and watchfulness that set all his perceptionsat concert pitch , with the result that he had seldom ex/perienced such complete awareness . It might have been his mood , which Ruth Bogart had detected when she had told him once not to take it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing easier to detect than over-anxiety or overinquisitiveness , but he knew that he would not overplay . All that bothered him was the perennial pitfall of an unconsidered word or gesture ; there was nothing which could prevent this contingency except hoping for the best . He pushed back his chair and stood up , smiling . " Well , hello , troops , " Big Ben said . " Why , hello yourself , " Jack Rhyce said . " If it is n't our sweet singer from Wake . Remember , Ruth ? In old New York ! In old New York. ! " He was even able to put the lilt of the tune in his voice . " I certainly do remember , " Ruth Bogart said . She smiled in just the right way , invitingly , but at the same time not seekingly . " It was terribly romantic out there before dawn , and you had such a lovely voice . " " Gee , thanks , " Big Ben said . " It was quite a surprise to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words with gentle humor , and smiled tolerantly at them . " Oh , now , " Jack Rhyce said , " come . What an implication ! We were just out for a stroll at Wake , were n't we , Ruth ? " . . to hear the boy friend , " Big Ben repeated with a chuckle , " answer right back from nowhere  --  it almost made me jump out of my swim trunks . " " We certainly owe you a drink if I did that , " Jack said . " Take a chair and take the weight off your feet , and give your order to the waiter . It ought to be a double or a triple for a boy as big as you . "  | " Aw , come on , " Big Ben said , and his hands relaxed on the table in front of him and he smiled at them both . " You 're not such a peewee yourself , fella . I 'll bet you played football in your time . " " Is that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Holmes , I played right tackle for Oberlin . Where did you play ? " " Oh ? shucks , " Big Ben said . " I was never in the big time like that . I only played for a jerk-water Southern Baptist college . " His words trailed off apologetically , and then he gave his orderto the waiter . " You savvy what 's called Bloody Mary , Boy-san ? Vodka and tomato juice , nice and cold and big . Sorry , folks , if I 'm unconventional , but you see , this is my playtime . " Jack had never watched or listened more carefully , but he could detect no flaw . The Baptist college explained that Southern accent ; there was no uneasiness anywhere . He could assume very safely now that he and Ruth were accepted for what they appeared to be and that they were in the clear . He was so sure of this that he had to fight down a rising sense of elation , because they were in an advantageous position as long as the position lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a real pleasure , meeting you . I suppose we ought to introduce ourselves . My name 's Rhyce  --  Jack Rhyce , and this is Ruth Bogart . We 're just travelingthrough  --  out here to make a survey for one of these foundations . " " Oh , yes , " Big Ben said . " Seems you mentioned the name of it back there at Wake . Seems to me it had the name of Friendship in it . " " You really have some memory , " Jack Rhyce said , " and it'sp162mighty flattering that we made such an impression on you duringour brief visit . The name 's the Asia Friendship League . " " That 's it , " Big Ben said . " Say , it 's a pleasure to meet you two nice people again , jack Rhyce and Ruth Bogart . My name 's Ben Bushman . Just old Flight Engineer Bushman , at the present time . Our crew lays over at Tokyo about ten days out of every month , and Bushman comes up here for ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way jack Rhyce and Ruth Bogart have come up to study Asia Friendship . Am I right , or am I right ? " " Well now , I do n't exactly know how to answer that one , " Jack Rhyce said . He laughed self-consciously , and so did Ruth Bogart . " But you must admit it is a friendly place here , Mr. Bushman , " she said , and smiled at him dazzlingly . " Now , now , honey , " Big Ben said , " let 's cut out the Bushmanpart . You call me Ben , and just remember I 'm tolerant as hell , and I do n't blame Jack here , for one minute , but any time if two is n't company and three is n't a crowd , just kind of look around for me , will you ? We might sing some old songs , or something . I 'm nuts for old songs . " " Why , that will be splendid , Ben , " Ruth Bogart said . " Jack loves old songs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do say so . . . but if he gets preachy or tiresome , I 'll know where to turn , and two will still be company , wo n't it , Ben ? " " Oh , now , Ruth , " Jack Rhyce said . He wished that her flirtatiousnessdid not sound so genuine , but she was right as far as the business went . " I 'm not as bad as all that , am I ? But she 's right , Ben . I do like a jam session sometimes . " " Well , maybe we can have one tonight , " Big Ben said . " There 's  |p163always  a few groups here who like to sing , later in the evening . Just drop down here into the bar sometime later , say eleven  --  that is , if you have n't something better to do . " He smiled in a very friendly way . " Oh , come , " Jack Rhyce said , " you must n't kid us , Ben . " Big Ben slapped him affectionately on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding you , boy , " he said , " I 'm envying you . Well , see you later , I hope . And now I 've got to be gittin ' . " " What 's your hurry ? " Jack said . " Have another drink . Do n't go . " Big Ben shook his head . " Thanks , " he said , " but I want to get cleaned up for this dancing party , and maybe I can find a girl myself . You two make me lonely . Well , I 'll see you later , troops . " Jack Rhyce heard Ruth Bogart sigh . He drew a deep breath himself , but his abnormal consciousness of life and motion was still with him as he watched Big Ben . The man 's walk was lazily loose-jointed , but at the same time perfectly co-ordinated . It was the gait of the highly proficient all-round athlete who could move from an eight-oar shell to the tennis courts , the boxing ring , the baseball diamond , or the football field with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him because he was aesthetically magnificent . He sauntered past the bar without stopping , shoulders carelessly squared and arms swinging easily . If Bill Gibson had not seen him come in , Bill had surely seen him by now . Jack 's first instinct was to deliver some sort of warning , but this would have been superfluous , and besides it had become more important than ever that neither he nor Ruth Bogart should be connected with Bill Gibson . Thingsp164were moving so fast that everything at any moment might pour itself into a barrel and go over Niagara Falls. "  --  It was all so natural , was n't it ? " she said , and her words echoed exactly what he had been thinking . That conversation with Big Ben had been so frank and real , so entirely in keeping with the guises they had assumed , and so banal and dull , that he could nearly believe that it had been true , but actually it had been interwoven with threads of truth . Footballat Oberlin , song fests because both of them honestly loved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all contributed to honesty . That piece about the Southern Baptist collegewas especially appealing . It was the one bit of really tangible revelation that had come through to him ; its hidden tones had been touching in their frankness . It had all been small-time , Big Ben said , and jack Rhyce could recall a lingering note of sadness . The Baptist college must have been true , just as there must have been some sort of social frustration there similar to what everyone faced in one 's adolescent years , and to which most people had learned to adjust . There had been something in that unknownSouthern Baptist college that Big Ben could not handle yet , although later he had traveled to more sophisticated fields . Jack Rhyce could see the place in his imagination . Small institutionsfor higher learning were apt to have a dreary similarity in the South . He could imagine a quadrangle of decrepit dormitories , a chapel in bad repair , a lecture hall , a tiny library with its carefully culled collection of deserving books , a football field with its goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat sandy country in the background . It all could have fitted into the composition of a Benton picture . The pinch of poverty would be over it , but at the same time lines of socialp165demarcation would be etched more strongly by the poverty , making them far harsher than any differentiations existing in the North . Distinction would be more than just the other side of the tracks in such a place ; there was a quality in Big Ben 's voice and gait that told its own story . White trash was the name for it , that unhappy phrase which was applied to people living in the clearings behind the pine-grown old fields , who had not solved for generations any of their economic problems . No matterwhat he had done at football , no matter about his singing voice , Big Ben had been white trash once ; and it was not hard to project imagination further , and see him in a mill town or in a great city . As he put the theoretical story together , Jack Rhyce believed that the Chief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least about the religious background . Big Ben 's father might very possibly have been one of those itinerantpreachers . The contagion of pulpit inflection still remained in Big Ben 's voice . It was a hymn-singing voice which Jack Rhyce could readily identify , since in many ways he and Big Ben had sprung from a common background , sharing many of the same repressions and simplicities . A minister 's son could spot a minister 's son . The saying was not wholly a joke . He felt her hand on his arm , shaking him insistently . " Darling , you 've got to talk to me , " she said  --  " that is , if we 're going to keep sitting in this damn place , or else if you keep sitting like a wooden Indian everybody will begin to think we 've had a fight . What have you been thinking about , Jack ? " " You ought to know , " he said , " about You-Know-Who , and you need n't have given him such a big glad eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At least you do n't know everything , do you , Fearless Fosdick ? "  | " Maybe Fosdick knows a little about You-Know-Whom , " he said . " And maybe Miss Fosdick does , too , " she answered , " and Miss Fosdick knows she can make him in about five minutes , if necessary . Maybe we should have registered as Mr. and Mrs. Fosdick . Do you think he was poor white trash , Jack ? " The mere fact that their minds had reached the same place independentlygave his theory added substance . " Yes , " he said , " I should n't wonder . I did n't know you knew the South . " " There were Southern girls in boarding school , " she said . " My roommate was a Southern girl  --  deep South , very deep . People like him are apt to go off the track somewhere . I ought to know , because I 've been off myself . Were you ever off it ? " " I was on two drops into Burma during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any tracks at all there . I 'm sort of used to being off the rails . " They were leaning toward each other , ostensibly absorbed in each other 's words , and they had waited long enough in the bar . They both had known , without saying so , that they should not leave the place directly on Big Ben 's heels . Jack signaled to a waiter , and paid the check . " Well , " she said , " thank goodness . Does this mean we can bathe and change ? Or have you got some other thought ? " The double bedroom , as she had said , afforded all the privacy of a goldfish bowl . " Anyway , " he said , " we may be able to talk with your bath water running . "  | " And we can talk with me splashing in it , " she said . " You do n't have to look , but I 'm going to have a bath . " They were another eager happy couple when they left the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the hotel corridor that pointed to the ell called Cozy Nook . " You know , darling , " he told her , " I was just thinking of another one of those Red Mill songs . Ben might just as well have sung it at Wake . " " Oh , sing it now , dear , " she said , " softly , just for me . " He drew her closer to him . They made a very pretty abstraction , flushed with their drinks from the Main Bar , on their way to Cozy Nook . Not that you are fair , dear , Not that you are true , Not your golden hair , dear , Not your eyes of blue . He stopped and laughed . " It does n't fit , does it ? " he said . " Your hair is too dark , dear , and your eyes are grayish green . " " Never mind , " she said . " I approve of the general scheme . Go ahead and finish it . " As a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . When we ask the the reason , Words are all too few ! So I know I love you , dear , Because you 're you.  | " I wish to goodness , " she said , and her voice had a catch in it , " that I could be me again , or I , or whatever damn way you want to have it . " It was the old lament again , and there was no solution to it , or certainly not then . Besides , there was not time to discuss it then because they had reached their room door , and he was pulling the clumsy outmoded key from his coat pocket . " Why , say , " he said in the bemused tone that one should use after a session with the girl of one 's choice at the Main Bar , " it 's unlocked . I thought I 'd locked it . Did n't you think I had , honey ? " " Why , yes , darling , " she answered . " I kind of thought so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have other things on my mind . " " Well , it all goes to show , " he said , " that I 'm losing my memoryin my old age . " They both laughed like two college freshmen . Then they hastily opened the door , using the standard Farm precautions . Mr. Moto was standing in the center of the room . The dust had been brushed from his light tan oxfords , his purplish blue suit had been freshly pressed . Jack Rhyce was not entirely surprised to see him , but he hoped that he acted surprised . The illusionwas helped when Ruth Bogart suppressed a startled scream that sounded technically genuine . " Well , how the hell did you get in here ? " Jack Rhyce asked , assuming the correct badgering tone of an honest American dealingwith a wily Oriental . " So sorry , " Mr. Moto said , and jack Rhyce was interested to see that his hands shook with artificial agitation . " The door was unlocked . So sorry . "  |p169The  door had not been unlocked , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The only solution for the problemwas to become more confused , to raise one 's voice a hectoringoctave higher . " And if the door was unlocked  --  so what ? " Jack Rhyce said . " Does that mean you should walk inside ? " " Excuse , " Mr. Moto said , and his hands fluttered placatingly , " but the door was wide open . More better , I thought , to wait for your return . Then things would not be stolen . Such old-fashioneddoors in this hotel . " " That 's funny , " Jack Rhyce said in a more reasonable tone . " I thought I 'd locked that door , but you never can tell , can you ? Anyway , it does n't look as if anybody had got into the suitcases , and you had your handbag down at the bar with you , did n't you , sweet ? " " Yes , " Ruth Bogart said . " My gold clip would have been the only thing that really mattered anyway . I think it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wished to heaven that he could place Mr. Moto , who was becoming an annoyingly loose end to the problem . " Of course I 'm grateful to Mr. Moto too , sweet , " he said . " I was only sort of startled at first , seeing him there , that 's all . Excuseit , Mr. Moto . What did you want to see me for ? " Mr. Moto bobbed his head and rubbed his hands together . Once more Jack Rhyce had the impression of a character that was too Japanese to be true . " First , may I ask you if all is right here , and proper ? " Mr. Moto asked . It did not alleviate Jack Rhyce 's frustration when Ruth Bogartgiggled softly at the word " proper . " He even wonderedp170whether Mr. Moto had used it intentionally , but then " proper " was a favorite Oriental word with many shades of meaning . " Everything is swell , thanks , " he answered . " And your wishes for tomorrow ? " Mr. Moto asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picnic and a ride toward the base of Mount Fuji ? And Lake Hakone is so very beautiful . But this means start early . " If it was n't one problem , it was another . In the light of recent events , he should have rented a car and driven it himself , so that it would have been parked outside the hotel at all hours , if they needed to get away , but now his mobility was controlled by the Japanese in front of him . Bill Gibson , he was thinking , would not approve of what he had done about the car . " I tell you what , " he said . " You be waiting outside with the car at seven o'clock tomorrow morning , and then we 'll decide what we want to do . " " Seven o'clock , " Mr. Moto repeated , and Jack Rhyce could not tell whether it was a repetition or a question . It was a ridiculouslyearly hour , out of keeping with a peaceful week end , but it might be that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little early , " Jack said , " but I was thinking we might climb some of the mountains . " He smiled at Ruth Bogart affectionately . " You want to see as much of everything as you can , do n't you , dear  --  that is , if you 're not too sleepy in the morning ? " " Jack , " she said , " I honestly do n't know how I 'll feel in the morning . " Jack Rhyce smiled at her patiently . " Of course , dear , if you do n't feel like it in the morning , " hep171said , " we can change everything . But it wo n't hurt to have him here early , just in case , now will it ? " " All right , " she said , " as long as it 's just in case . " " Well , that 's settled , " Jack Rhyce said , smiling in a man-tomanway at Mr. Moto . " Let 's make it eight , and thanks , and forgiveanything I said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door 's locked next time . "  |p172HE  STOOD close to the closed door listening to the sound of Mr. Moto 's footsteps retreating down the hall in a clumsy noisy rhythm wholly different from the soft step on the gravel by the temple . The footsteps indicated as plainly as words that Mr. Moto knew he would be listening . Ruth Bogart crossed the room , making a quick noiseless check of the suitcases . She shook her head as a signal that nothing had been disturbed . He moved to the window and peered out . The afterglow had left the sky , and the electric lights had been turned on along the paths of the hotel grounds . He drew the curtains carefully . " Turn on the water in the tub , " he whispered . " Oh , Jack , " she called as she turned the water on , " has n't it been a wonderful day , darling ? " It was not the right adjective to describe it , and besides , the day was only just beginning . She moved close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was glad to put his arms around her . He had seldom felt so grateful for companionship . " My God , " she said , " it 's really started now . " " Yes , " he said , " it 's moving . What do you know about Skirov ? " " Skirov . . . " she repeated vaguely . He could not blame her much when her whole mind must have been on the present.  | " Yes , " he said . " Skirov , the Russian who 's running the Communistshow here  --  the masterminder whom our boy makes contact with . The Chief briefed you on him , did n't he ? " " Oh , yes , " she said . " I 'm sorry , Jack . I was thinking about the Jap and the big goon down in the bar and everything . Yes , Skirov . I saw him in Vienna once  --  Cossack descent , I think . " " You saw him ? " Jack Rhyce said . " Then you can tell me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , one hundred twelve , thin , agile , delicate hands and feet , Mongoloid features . " " Yes , " she said , " that 's him . " Jack Rhyce lowered his voice , not because he was afraid of beingoverheard , but because he dreaded that his idea might not be right . " All right , " he said , " what about this Moto ? Is he Skirov playinga Jap ? " He was conscious of his anxiety while he waited for her reaction . It had been one of those swift inspirations which he had learned to suspect , but if he were right , they might be able to end the show that evening , because they would have worked out the whole scheme of the apparatus . It would be Gibson 's job to make the ultimate decision regarding Skirov , but from their point of view , the mission would be accomplished . The prospect of completing a mission always had its alluring side ; he had never before been so desperately anxious to end one , not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering his question . Her forehead was wrinkledand she gazed straight ahead of her . He was aware both of her nearness and her beauty , which annoyed him because his mind should have been concentrated on abstractions.  |p174Finally  she looked up at him , not enthusiastically , but with respect . " I guess I was wrong in thinking that big handsome boys like you are dumb , " she said . " I like your thought . I wish I could buy it all . " He had already developed the thought further , while she was speaking . " Maybe it 's more reasonable than it sounds at first , " he said . " Take it this way . " He began to speak in a whisper , in spite of the running water . " They looked us over in San Francisco . They 've got us down as innocent bystanders . They think we 're absolutely pure . " " Yes , " she said . " I check with that . I think we 're clear to date . I had that feeling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his enthusiasm rose . " Then what could be better than using us as a cover ? Would n't you do it if you were on their side of the fence ? Skirov and Big Ben want to meet . They know we 're greenhorns . What 's better than having Skirov as a Japanese chauffeur ? That explains his being in the room  --  just to make a final check . " He stopped and laughed quietly . " What 's so funny ? " she asked . " The two contacts , " he said . " Us doing the same thing  - -  coming up here for a meeting . It 's like a convention in Atlantic City , is n't it ? " " Yes , " she said , but she did not look amused . " It 's funny if true . The trouble is , it 's too good to be true . Life is n't made that way . It 's too damned easy , darling . " Her criticism confirmed his own inner dread . She was right ,  |p175that  life never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business . " Besides , Jack , " she said , " he simply is n't Skirov . " " You do n't know Japs as well as I do , " he answered . " This one 's like something on the stage . " " I 've got eyes too , dear , " she said . " Perhaps he 's trying to hide his rank or education , but I know he is n't Skirov . " " ' Well , if he is n't , " Jack Rhyce asked , " who is he ? " She shook her head slowly , and her expression reminded him of the Whittier 's poem about the schoolhouse . " It 's too bad  --  because it fits  --  but he just is n't , " she said . " He 's in the business , all right ; I can spot that as well as you can  --  but he is n't Moscow-trained . You know he is n't , darling . You know how that Moscow school sticks out all over them . You can spot them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Volkswagen . Skirov is a Moscow boy . This one just is n't . " Jack Rhyce sighed . " All right , " he said . " But I still want Bill Gibson 's reaction . Since you can spot them  --  what about Big Ben ? Was he on the Moscow squad ? " " Yes , " she said . " I do n't agree , " he said . " But what makes you think so ? " " You 'd have noticed it in the bar , " she said , " if you had n't been concentrating on the dialogue , darling . That Paul Robeson , Old Man River manner , that lift-that-bale , **27;10303;TOOLONG . It 's late Moscow . It 's still being taught there by their prewar American imports . They must have rather a quaint American section . "  | " I 've got to watch him some more , " Jack said . " He does n't look much like it to me . He looks as American as all get-out . " He wanted to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college days , but it would have to wait until later . " Of course he 's as American as all get-out , " she said . " A lot of very American Americans have gone to Moscow . Jack Reed went and he 's in the Red Square now , if they have n't moved him . Now unzip my dress , will you ? I 'm going to have that bath , but I 'll leave the door open , if you have any more ideas . " He had a number of ideas as he sat in an easy chair near the window and listened to her splashing in the tub , but he had learned long ago that it was folly to spread ideas around . No one should ever know more than necessary in the business ; the less you knew the less you could tell if they caught you . It occurredto him that he should not even have told her his idea about Skirov . His having done so went to show that he was talking too much , and besides he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Gibson . Bill would have the whole story straight , while he and Ruth Bogart were still only on the fringes of it . Nevertheless , he was already getting his general shape and structure so clearly that a question of policywas beginning to arise . Should the apparatus be smashed , or should it be left alone in the hope of locating Skirov ? But Bill Gibson , not he , would make the ultimate decision . The main thing was to get the picture straight . He wished that he did not have to see Bill Gibson that night , now that the dangers of the meeting had measurably increased with Big Ben on the scene . However , the importance of an immediatemeeting had increased correspondingly , but now thep177contact must be made more carefully than ever . The room was growing dark . He rose and switched on the light that stood on the small table separating the twin beds . " Jack , " she called , " are you all right ? " " Yes , " he said . " I 'm fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me some new ideas . " " You know that 's bad technique , to tell too much , " he said ; " and you know the reason , Ruth . " " Yes , " she said , " I know . " She was out of the bathroom , brushing her hair by the mirror with quick , brisk , almost savage strokes . She was wearing an oldishcotton print robe . " I 'll buy you a kimono tomorrow , " he said . " You 'd look well in a kimono , green and blue . " " Thanks , " she said . " I 'm sorry about the thing I have on . I did n't know there was going to be a bedroom scene . I 've started your bath for you . " " Thanks , " he said . He began taking things from his suitcase , putting his brushes and toilet articles on the tall dresser , laying his blue suit carefully over the foot of the bed and his dark black shoes with their composition soles on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins , as you were bound to be in the business . " I was thinking about tonight , " he said . " Were you ? " she said . " Well , you are n't the only one . " They looked at each other thoughtfully for a second . " You know you 're right about that goon , " he said . " From the way he looked at you I think maybe you could take Big Ben  --  if you keep on encouraging him . "  | " Yes , I know I can , " she answered . " But at the same time it makes me mad , " he said . " But maybe it 's a good thing for tonight . " " Why for tonight ? " she asked . He hesitated before he answered , and she must have guessed what was running through his mind . Nevertheless , it was part of the business . " I want Ben 's mind to be off things for about an hour . You do it and I 'll see Gibson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boy off . He must n't worry where I am , and only be glad I 'm not where he is . It 's the best way of handling things , do n't you think ? " Her face grew stiff and wooden . She did not answer . " What is it , Ruth ? " he asked . He spoke more gently . " Are you afraid of him ? " " No , I do n't think so , " she said , " but I hated that mental undressingway he looked at me , and you 'd have to be mighty convincingwith a man like that . " It was the business , it was what she was there for , and they both knew it , but still he felt his face redden . " I did n't mean anything serious , " he said . " Just a walk downtownor a ride up the mountain in his car . " The set expression left her face and she smiled . " It 's nice to know you 're human occasionally , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you personally , but I do n't think it would be a good one , anyway . It 's too damned obvious , jack , and he 's a very smart man . " " Yes , he 's smart , " Jack said . " It 's just the thing we 'd be expected to do , " she said . " Do n't you see it would tell him right away that there was somethingp179wrong with us ? You 've got to be jealous and difficult . It would look better if I simply let him know he was attractive to me  --  and made him want to get me away from you . " She moved closer to him and put her hands on his shoulders . " Now listen , Ruth , " he said , " I 'm ashamed I made that proposition , but it was business , Ruth . " " Never mind the proposition , jack , " she told him , her grip on his shoulders tightening . " Just get it through your head that I want to stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a shiv in your back . " " If anybody 's watching , " he said , " it 's going to be harder for two to get up to that cottage than one . " " Jack , " she said , and she moved closer to him , " please  --  all right , I 'm frightened . I 'm scared as hell . All right , he 's scared me , on your account more than mine , Jack . I promise I wo n't let you down . " He bent over and kissed her . Even as he did so he knew that under any circumstances he was being very foolish . " All right , " he said , " but put on a dark dress , and let 's go down to dinner . " " Darling , " she said again , " I wo n't let you down . You 'd be surprised . I 'm wonderful in the dark . " Jack Rhyce had often thought that any ballroom anywhere in the world was interchangeable with any other . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballroom and the dances that derived from it were a part of Western civilization that should have interested Spengler . If you thought of it in purely historical terms , the decline of the West  --  and he believed that in many ways the West was declining  --  could bep180interestingly illustrated by ballrooms and modern music . The time and place that night made thoughts like those more naturalthan usual because the ballroom of the hotel was an incongruity , like its native orchestra . The jazz and the people had no evolutionary place in the Japanese starlit night . They were only there as part of the flotsam on the wave of history . At almost any time the European dancers might be whisked away , but the dance convention would be left behind because of its social , sensualand selective attributes . In fact , with the leisure of the machineage , how could people get on without dancing ? They are no longer physically tired , and the imponderables of life are heavier , and with them grows the need to escape reality . A great many couples were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at shortly before ten o'clock that night . They whirled with fancy steps that they had learned on other dance floors . No one noticed the elaborate Japanese paper decorationson the high ceiling . They were all following the uninspiredrhythms of the Japanese orchestra , which did its best , in costume and manner , to follow the American tradition . The music was mediocre , and most of it dated , but everyone who danced lost part of his or her individuality in the pervading sound . The girls , both European and Japanese , were pretty . The men seemed to find it harder to surrender themselves to the pleasures of the evening . Their faces , as they danced , looked less forgetful and more careworn than their partners ' . Tall windows on both sides of the room opened directly on the hotel grounds so that the dancing was almost in the open air , but even so the orchestra sounded surprisingly loud . Its members , though small men , were eager , conscientious and vigorous . She was a light and beautiful dancer , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough , in that rather pedestriancompany , to be disturbingly outstanding . Their steps had a professional exactness , and they both looked well  --  she in her dark green and he in his conservatively cut blue suit . He was aware that they were attracting approving attention , which was something he could have dispensed with that night . " Do n't do anything fancy , " he told her . " Just dance in a mediocreway . You 're too good-looking as it is . " " That 's what I thought about you when I saw you first , " she said . " You 're too good-looking for the business . You look like the answer to a maiden 's prayer in this crowd . " " Do you see him anywhere ? " he asked . She smiled and shook her head . " I wish he were here so we could keep an eye on him , " he said . " We 've been dancing about half an hour , have n't we ? " " Yes , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under other circumstances , " he told her , " but Bill 's going to get nervous pretty soon . I wonder where he is . " " Bill ? " she asked . " No , no , " he said . " The Big Boy . I gathered he was going to the dance tonight from the way he was talking in the bar . " He felt her shiver , and she shook her head . " I wish you 'd get him off your mind , " she said , " or at least look as though you were having a good time so people wo n't wonder what we 're going to do when we go outside . Hold me closer . Do n't forget , we 're supposed to be in love . " It was another half hour before he saw Big Ben . He had stepped in from the grounds outside . Instead of his Aloha shirt and khaki trousers , he wore a charcoal flannel suit , black shoes and a dark tie . He appeared very young to Jack Rhyce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows ; only his eyes gave his age away . Eyes and hands were something that nobody ever could disguise . " Good , " Jack said . " There he is , coming in from outside . " He felt her shiver again . " Is he looking for us ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said , " I think so . " " If he cuts in , " she said , " cut back soon . Please , Jack . " " All right , " he said , " but do n't discourage him . It wo n't hurt to have him fall for you . " Big Ben smiled pleasantly while his glance roved over the dancers . Jack Rhyce noticed that he pulled his coat straight , although it had not been disarranged . Then Big Ben took a handkerchief and passed it lightly over his forehead , though he had not been dancing , and then made a gesture with his hands as though he were ridding them of imaginary dust . " He sees us now , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Jack Rhyce said , " and when he cuts in , smile . " Big Ben was moving toward them through the dancers , a head taller than most of the men . A second later he slapped Jack Rhyce on the shoulder . It was a friendly , good-natured slap . " Hello , Oberlin , " he said . " Why , hello , " Jack Rhyce answered , " Alabama Baptist U. " Big Ben 's laugh was easy and infectious . " Your guessing cap 's on crooked , boy , " he said . " Not Alabama , Mississippi . " " Oh , come now , " Jack Rhyce said , " your accent is n't thick enough . Let 's make it Carolina . " " Okay , " Big Ben said . " Carolina Baptist . And now may I relieveyou of your lovely burden , Oberlin , just for a little while ? "  | " You mean you want to dance with my girl ? " Jack Rhyce asked him . " All right , but just remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , " Ruth Bogart said , " do n't pretend to act so jeal ous , Jack . I 'd love to dance with Ben just as long as he wants . " She sighed , giving Big Ben another of her dazzling smiles . " Maybe I need a change . . . . " Jack Rhyce walked to an open doorway and watched them . Like many large men , Big Ben danced very well , even to the nervous jiggling beat of the orchestra . " Hold me closer , " she had said . " Do n't forget that we are supposed to be in love . " You had to be able to estimate degrees of physical attraction , and to observe and capitalize on the onslaughts of desire , if you wanted to be successful in the business . It was a sordid matter , standing there watching Ruth Bogart and the big man dancing . He was ashamed of playing a part in that ugly scene , but it was business . Seeing them dance was like watching the merging of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement with another of ruthless , dynamic force . It occurred to him that Big Ben might never before have had the experience of dancing with anyone like Ruth Bogart . She had never looked more delicateor more a perfect product of gentle upbringing than when Big Ben held her in his arms . He saw her lips move in some smilingremark . He saw Big Ben answer , and he did not care to guess what they had said . In the beginning he had entertained a technical fear , which she had expressed in their room upstairs , that her approach might have been too obvious . It had been necessary for her to move fast but , at the same time , Big Ben was a clever man.  |p184There  was always the question , in such encounters , as to the exactmoment when intellectual objectiveness could be discounted . He realized , as soon as he saw them dancing , that Ruth Bogart must have considered this matter also . There was that saying that the desire of woman is to be desired , and a woman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interplayhad been , and obvious as it had seemed to Jack Rhyce as an observer , from what he could see as he stood watching Ruth Bogart had been right about Big Ben . They were a handsome couple on the dance floor . He was certain now that she was something new in his experience . It was certain that he would not forget . Those things did not take long when certain instincts were in the balance . In its essence , jazz was not happy music . It was restless and lacking in order , reflecting very accurately the spirit of the era which had brought it into being . The world was unhappy and Jack Rhyce was in a better position than most of his contemporariesto know because it had been his business in many places to observe and deal with violence . All his generation had been born and nurtured in an age of discontent , but he was not able to explain the reason for it , unless that a system or a way of life was approaching dissolution . Logically there were less reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been fifty years before . The cleavage between wealth and povertyhad been greater then , and the voice of social conscience had only been a whisper . Communication and industrial advance had been negligible compared with the present , and so had publichealth and expectancy of life ; yet back in that harder day the world had been much happier . There had been security thenp185in that everyone knew what to expect . There had been strength and order , which perhaps were the attributes that mankind most desired . What was it that had palsied the hand of the political system which had ruled the world at the time of Rudyard Kipling , in as benign and enlightened a manner as many political thinkers were attempting to rule it now ? What was it that had opened the Pandora box and the floodgates of discontent ? What was it that had allowed minorities to give such a loud voice to their grievances that they could upset the lives of persons ten thousand miles away ? And what was the basis of the nationalism that made all nations truculent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world were disturbed , overpopulating the mental institutions , rebelling against conventions , filling the streets with juvenile delinquents ? Why was it that no firm hand could any longer quell a social riot ? He knew it had been differentonce , before his time , and he knew that the answer to these questions lay in what was known as the phenomenon of change . The same questions must have arisen when the Roman Empirewas falling . They had been asked also in the briefer and turbulentdynasties of China , and in eighteenth-century France . Volumes had been written about the course of the disease , but its cause was still in doubt . There was no doubt at all , however , regarding the ultimate result , and in the world as he saw it , both in the East and in the West , the result was just around the corner , eager and waiting . Anarchy might rule for a while in North Africa . Egypt or Persia might upset the Near East balance . Neutralismmight reign in India , but still the result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been  --  the ruthless oppressionof absolute rule . It was now called the dictatorship of thep186proletariat , " but its end was the old dictatorship . The proletariat , with their agitators and their discontented , would be whipped back to their places , and order would be restored more merciless than the order of the Pax Romana or Britannica . And again there would be discontent , simply because man was a discontentedbeing . The cycle would go on . He realized that it was not the time or place to think of such things , but at least these thoughts made him a part of the stream of history . He and his generation were children of discontent . The drives of discontent had put him where he was , watching the dancers , and at the same time looking at the dark hotel grounds in order to memorize the shadowy places and the plan of the lighted paths . It was curious to think that the same drives which had placed him there had acted in such a different way upon Big Ben , who was still dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Big Ben might easily have swapped places . Tolerance was one of the troubles of the present . You knew , or you thought you knew , so much about human motivation that , in the end , you could not blame anyone for anything . And in the end rules and laws lost meaning . Perhaps it was this universal tolerance that was weakeningthe hand of order . He looked into the night again . The cottage called ChrysanthemumRest was completely visible . Though its shades and curtainswere drawn , he could see that its rooms were lighted , as was the path that led straight toward it from one of the hotel verandas . But if one were to follow another path up toward the greenhouses , there would be shadow and concealment . He could not plan the full approach from where he stood . He would havep187to improvise after he had started . A glance at his wrist watch told him it was time  --  1o:2o already . Ruth Bogart had been right in believing that it would look better if they walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start now . He moved across the room to where she was dancing with Big Ben . " Okay , Baptist , " Jack said , " time for the praying colonels to go to the showers  --  the half is over . " " Aw , gee , coach , " Big Ben said , " nobody 's even blown the whistle . Well , thanks a lot , honey . And how about us all meeting in the bar in a while ? I 'm going there right now to drown my frustrations , honey . " Ruth Bogart giggled appreciatively . " I do n't know whether Jack has frustrations or not , " she said , " but whatever he does have , he always seems to be all for the drowning process . We 'll be there whether I like it or not , wo n't we , darling ? " " Oh , come on , " Jack said . He put his arm playfully around her . " You 're going to have ginger ale , sweet . We 'll see you down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes first , " Ruth said , " and then I want to go out and get a breath of fresh air . It 's awfully hot in here . " Big Ben laughed uproariously . " And I bet you 're getting a headache , too , " he said . " How come ? You did n't want fresh air when I asked you three minutes ago , honey ? Well , no hard feelings . So long , troops . " They danced for a minute or two without speaking . " He 's gone all right , " Jack said , " and he has n't gone outside , either . "  | " That 's so , " she said . " I think you 're right . I do n't believe he 's on to us at all . " " What makes you say that ? " Jack asked her . " Oh , " she said . " Girls can tell about those things . If you want to know  --  from the way he tried to make me . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could be that we 're barking up the wrong tree , " Jack Rhyce said . " It could be that he 's just a lonely soul on an airship . The world is full of them these days . " " It could be , " she said . " But there was one queer thing about him . " " What ? " he asked . " He had n't been dancing , had he ? " she said . " But he was all in a glow , wringing wet with perspiration , darling . Did you noticehim dust his hands and wipe his forehead when he came in ? Whatever he was doing , he was exercising . " " Maybe he was playing Tarzan in the trees , " Jack Rhyce said . " His hands are so damned big , " she said , " and his palms were sweating . " " Well , he 's gone now , " Jack Rhyce said . " Let 's go out and look at the moon . " " Oh , Jack , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear her , " who told you that there was a moon ? "  |p189THEY  WALKED outside and toward the greenhouses , laughing and talking softly , only one of a number of other couples who were wandering about the grounds . While they walked they examined Chrysanthemum Rest from all angles . There was a clump of bamboo by its door , which was the only cover near it . Still talking softly , they examined the taller fir trees near the greenhouse . Jack was as sure as a fallible human being could be that he had missed nothing , having reconnoitered too many places not to be intensely aware of atmosphere . He had been able to tell for a long while , from his own physical reactions , whether or not a place was being watched . There was always a sort of tenseness in the air and an awareness of other people . He could swear that Chrysanthemum Rest was clear . They sat for a while close together on a bench in the shadow of an old cryptomeria , two lovers in case anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " There 's only one offbeat thing . We 've been . out here for fifteen minutes , and have you noticed , no one 's moved inside the house ? Not a shadow against the curtains  --  nothing . Perhaps he is n't there . " " He 's being still , " Jack said , " because he wants it to look as if he were n't there . Bill 's a smart operator . Anything else ? " " No , " she said . " I do n't think we 're being watched . " All that was left was the unavoidable danger that someone , byp190sheer inadvertence , might notice them entering Chrysanthemum Rest , a calculated risk which the bamboo thicket by the door would minimize . If they walked affectionately past the cottage , the thicket would conceal them from anyone standing higher up from the hill , and its shadow would partially protect them from anyone who would be looking from the hotel windows . Of course the door would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they crossed the threshold . Nevertheless , he delayed for a while , with his attention glued on the Chrysanthemumcottage . It was a white frame building of European style , similar to the cottage annexes that surrounded summer hotels at home . It stood peacefully at the foot of the slope of lawn that led from the tree under which they sat . He wished that he could be sure that Big Ben was in the bar . He even thought of making a check , but his feeling that the cottage was not under observationmade him dismiss the idea . " Come on . Let 's go , " he said . " We 'll know a lot more after we 've talked to Bill . " The brass of the dance orchestra blared across the lawn , interspersed with its drummer 's beat . They were only a couple returning to the dance as they walked to Chrysanthemum Rest . His arm tightened around her waist as they reached the bamboo thicket . " Follow me quick , " he whispered . They were inside the house in a twinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closed behind them without a sound and without a fingerprint on its knob , either . The place , as he had observed , was fully lighted . They were in a small entrancehall furnished with a European umbrella stand and a row of wooden pegs for coats and hats . A single open door showed ap191lighted room , comfortably furnished with wicker easy chairs and a couch . There was a Chinese rug on the floor and gay Japanese prints decorated the walls . The room , to jack Rhyce 's surprise , was empty ; so they stood for a moment , breaths held , listening . He could detect no sound except the blare of the dance music . He raised his eyebrows and gestured to Ruth Bogart . She understood his signal and they moved along the wall so that their shadows would not show on the drawn curtains . It never paid to hurry . Later , he never could recall what it was that made him sure that something was wrong in Chrysanthemum Rest . " Bill , " he whispered . What with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , but in any case he already had the conviction that he would not be answered . The bedroom door was also open . The lights were on there , too . He tiptoed to the doorway with Ruth Bogart just behind him . Bill Gibson , in a clean pair of shantung silk pajamas , lay beneath the covers of his bed , eyes closed , head resting on his pillow , his clothes neatly folded on a chair at the end of the room . A glass , a half-empty bottle of whisky and a pill bottle stood under the lamp on the bedside table . His restful posture gave every indication that he was sound asleep , but he was not breathing . Bill Gibson was stone dead . " Okay , " Jack Rhyce whispered to her . He felt in his pocket and drew on a pair of gloves . " Better go through his suitcase , Ruth . Look for anything . Anything . " But even as he spoke he knew there would not be anything they wanted . While she moved noiselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at the body of Bill Gibson , trying to estimate the strengths and weaknesses of this new situation in much thep192same way a bridge player might assess the possibilities in dummy when the cards were on the board . Now that Bill Gibson was dead , a whole new line of action was required . He was still in the grip of shock , but he was able to see at once that he was looking at a professional , almost a classic job of elimination . If Bill Gibson had been breathing , Jack Rhyce himself would have thought that it was an overdose of sleeping pills , and after all , suicide due to strain or melancholia had always been a factor in the business . The only trouble was that they had come too early . Bill Gibson should have been discovered in the morning for the job to have been perfect , and doubtless that had been the intention . This was an encouraging thought for Jack Rhyce , in that it showed as plain as print that no one knew that Bill Gibson was there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentthat he and Ruth Bogart were not suspected yet . There was another plain fact . The decision must have been made some time previously that Bill Gibson should be put out of the way , since the whole job was one that had obviously requiredmeticulous planning . It also betrayed an anxiety to keep things quiet which was completely understandable to anyone in the business , where violent ways of taking out a man , no matter how carefully worked , always offered embarrassing complications . On the other hand , the danger of complication at ChrysanthemumRest was very small indeed . Success only required that the body be discovered in the morning . Without his being familiar with Japanese medical procedure , Jack Rhyce did not believe that a doctor called in the morning would make more than a perfunctory examination with the evidence before him ; no doubt if a more thorough examination should be made this contingency would have been provided for . He picked up the pillp193bottle , which still held three yellow capsules , a very pretty touch in itself when added to a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A drunken man had accidentally taken an overdose of sleeping pills . From the color of the capsules , and without reading the label , he could guess that the drug was one of the better-known barbiturates of American manufacture , and he could guess from a minute abrasion at the corner of Bill Gibson'smouth that a lethal dose was safely in the stomach . There were several ways to make reluctant people swallow . Jack Rhyce set down the pill bottle and sniffed of Bill Gibson'slips . There was the requisite odor of whisky to explain the half-empty whisky bottle on the table . The whisky had been appliedoverliberally to the lips , but no one would have noticed in the morning . Professionally it was a job which had only one unavoidable drawback , and even this presupposed the presence of another professional , which indicated again that he and Ruth Bogart were not suspected yet . Like every killing in the business , this one had its signature , and this was ridiculously easy to decipheronce you knew it was a killing . The job presupposed enormousand expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bill Gibson as gently and effortlessly as a nurse might handle a baby , and Bill Gibson was no weakling . He touched Bill Gibson 's hand softly . The body was still warm . He slipped his hand under the head . The mark of a hypodermic was barely visible in the hair at the base of the neck . If one had not known exactly where to look , the mark could easily have gone unnoticed . He lowered the head very gently because it was all a very private matter in which he and his opposite numbers shared the same anxiety to keep it quiet , to keep it clean , to keep it above suspicion.  |p194Ruth  Bogart was looking at him from across the room and he nodded slowly in answer to her unspoken question . " Yes , " he said , " Ben was here all right . I wish I could have the privilege of polishing off that son-of-a-bitch . I always thought a lot of Bill . " " Yes , so did I , " she said . But when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His attention turned to the neatly folded clothes . Even the shoes by the chair were in meticulous alignment . The bedclothes were carelessly disarranged just as a man who was drunk might have moved them . The folded clothes were an error , or still better , an oversight . Bill Gibson must have folded them himself . He must have planned to meet them in pajamas and a dressing gown . Jack Rhyce peered into the bathroom . A burgundy silk dressing gown was hung from a hook on the bathroom door . He examined the back and sleeves . There was a slight tear at the right elbow , and the silk was scuffed and a few tiny hairs of woolen lint were mingled with the fabric . It was the blue piling from a carpet , and the Chinese carpet in the living room was blue . Ruth Bogart had finished with Bill Gibson 's baggage and with the contents of his pockets . She shook her head when he nodded to her  --  but then , Bill Gibson would have been careful to have nothing on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " The living room , " he said . " He must have grabbed Bill right by the front door . I 'd like to polish off that son-of-a-bitch . " He walked gingerly to the living room and she followed him . Of course there had been a struggle . How was it she had put it  --  that Big Ben had been all of a glow , and he had n't been dancing ? Yet the signs had been eliminated , and nothing had beenp195broken . However , the impersonal orderliness of the room told its own story of rearrangement . He could reconstruct what had happened as though it were going on now before his eyes  --  Big Ben in a noiseless bound , towering over Bill Gibson , the jolt in the solar plexus that knocked out the wind . Strangulation was not necessary if you knew the trick . Big Ben 's arms wrapped around the smaller man 's gasping body . . . the fighting for breath . . . the expert hands lowering the struggling man to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in Big Ben 's pocket . " When you danced with him , " he said to Ruth Bogart , " was there anything in his coat ? " " I think so , " she said . It would have been the hypodermic , but this would not have been bulky . The piling of the carpet was scuffed and trampled near the door  --  not markedly so , but still the evidence was there once you guessed the story . " They do n't know about us yet , " he said , " or they would n't have pulled it this way , do you think ? " " I think you 're right , " she said . " You 're pretty smart sometimes , Jack . " " Okay , " he said . " We 'd better get out of here , and brace yourself . There 's one thing more that 's going to be tough to-night . " " How do you mean ? What else ? " she asked , and for the first time since they had entered Chrysanthemum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've got to keep in the clear , " he said . " We 've got to go and meet that bastard in the bar . " " Oh , no , " she said , " not that . "  | " Oh , yes , " he said . " Just that , and we 'd better be in the mood for it , too , because he 's a smart Joe , dear . Muss yourself up a little . Kiss me . Put some lipstick on my cheek . He 's got to know we 've been out in the garden making love . " No matter what happened in the business you had to go on with the show . When they got theirs , you let them go , and the show had to go on , if only because you knew you had to get yours sometime in some sordid corner or some cellar of some prison , and you would try to take it without a prayer for mercy , if you were in the business . You learned how to dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were in the business . The scene which had taken place in Chrysanthemum Rest was still in Jack Rhyce 's mind when they left the small detached building . His arm was around her , and they stopped and kissed shamelessly directly underneatha light on the path to the hotel . After all , the hour  --  which was just past eleven now  --  was growing late enough so that inhibitions should be breaking if boys were to be boys and girls girls . But even then he realized that their abandon had a quality that was partially genuine . " Darling , " he said loudly , " you 're adorable . " She giggled . She was very good at that girlish giggle which must have been a vestigeof the outside . " Darling , " she said , " not again . Not here . Everyone will see us . She said it exactly as though they were not intending that any even remotely interested parties should see them . At some points there were lighter moments in the business . But their words and actions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have ice water in his veins any more than she , and he had not recovered from the impact of that pseudo-quiet death in Chrys/anthemum Rest . His creative projections into Big Ben 's characterall added to the acuteness of his upset . In his imagination he could hear Big Ben 's voice behind his own and hers , and the gentledrawl had a nauseating quality in his memory . He could hear Big Ben speaking as he pinned Bill Gibson down , gasping and helpless . The voice would be kind , since in the end personal animosityought never to obtrude itself in the business , and if your emotions got the better of you it was time to resign and be a salesman of fancy motor cars . Jack Rhyce knew that the scene in Chrysanthemum Rest was playing on his emotions , which was not right . He could hear Big Ben 's voice in his imagination . " You 're goin ' out in a minute , friend , " he could hear Big Ben saying . " You might as well go out easy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' out anyway , friend ? Easy 's better than hard , is n't it ? And I 've got no hard feelings . I 'll he'p you if you go out easy , and I 'll be right with you , friend . Now swallow these pills . They wo n't hurt nobody . Just get them down or I have to make you . Swallow them , and then there 'll be the needle , and you and I know that it wo n't hurt at all . Do n't make me be rough , Mac , because it wo n't gain you anything . I know that poison kit you folks carry . In case you 're curious , it 's what you call Shot Number Two . " The soft imaginary voice of Big Ben mingled with the music from the ballroom , and Jack Rhyce knew it was time to pull himself together . " I 'm against alcohol as a crutch on general principles , " he said , " but I think you and I could do with two good doubles in that bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you for once , darling , " she said . He felt her shiver , and he shook her in a rough playful way.  | " For God 's sake pull yourself together , " he said . " The show 's on the road . " " All right , " she said . " So it 's on the road , and stop being a space cadet . " He straightened his blue coat and felt his belt . He might not be carrying a weapon but , given the showdown , a properly fixed belt was a good substitute . His was fixed . He wished that he could slash his belt across Big Ben 's face just once . Twice would be better  --  twice and Big Ben 's closest relative would n't know him.  |p199THE  ATMOSPHERE in the Main Bar had changed since he and Ruth Bogart had been there last , for the better as far as hotel receipts were concerned . There was no doubt any longer , if there ever had been previously , that the patrons  --  aside from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun as vigorously as Madame Butterfly had in another generation  --  realized that they were far away from home . Their loneliness plus the dancing and the drinks had begun drawing them together , so that an alcoholic affection , plus an undercurrent of companionship in misery formed the motif for the now crowded bar . The flyers , the officers of the ground forces , the Navy personnel , the American civilians in and out of government jobs , and even a few Europeanized Japanese had begun to realize that they were all members of the Legion of the Lost Ones . No one had as yet started to sing " Gentlemen Rankers " or The Road to Mandalay , " but several men by the bar were already drunk , and an American girl was doing a dramatic recitation in a cornerto which no one in her party listened . A sea of smoke and spilled drinks and voices washed like a wave over Jack Rhyce and Ruth Bogart . " All right , honey , " he said , "  --  we 're tight and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , in a big way , and this is our night off . Why , lookit  --  there 's Big Ben , just where he said he 'd be . " He leaned down until her hair brushed his cheek  | " Just remember , he does n't know who we are , " he whispered . " Just hold that thought , sweet , and give me another kiss . It 's better that I 'm all lipsticked up tonight . " It was common sense aside from anything else . There could never be anything sinister about a man if he was smeared with lipstick , and what was it Bill Gibson had said ? There was safety in sex . Perhaps if Bill had practiced that maxim himself he would not have been a corpse in Chrysanthemum Rest . " Oh , Jack , " Ruth Bogart said , and her voice had the shrill note that fitted with that happy evening , " look at Ben . He 's got a man with a squeeze box with him . Are n't you glad we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him an unpleasant twinge to observe the number of amused faces that turned toward them after Ruth Bogart had asked her last question . Naturally she did not need to tell him to look at Big Ben . Big Ben stood in the middle of a noisy group near the center of the room , and sure enough , a man with an accordion was with him . He had learned the tricks of holding attention that could only have been derived from the theater . In fact , at the moment Big Ben might have been master of ceremoniesin a night club , and perhaps he had held such a position once . " Jack , " she whispered , " he 's changed his shirt . " She did not have to tell him . He had been wearing a white shirt when he had cut in on them on the dance floor , but now his shirt was blue . " That 's right , " Jack said . " He 's been having a busy evening , sweet . Wave to him . He 's seen us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called.  | " Why , sweetness , " Big Ben called , and he shook his finger at her . " Say , whatever have you been doing to Oberlin ? Honest , I could n't guess . " Ruth glanced at Jack 's face . She gave a stifled scream . " Oh , Jack , " she said , " I 'm sorry . They told me in the States that it would n't come off , darling . " Jack Rhyce grinned self-consciously at Big Ben and the boys and girls around him , then he pulled out a pocket handkerchief , wiped his cheeks and lips , and shook his head . " I guess the trouble is , dear , this is n't the States . Maybe nothing'skiss-proof in Japan . " It was a pretty good line , considering , and the laugh that greeted it confirmed his impression . A man with lipstick on him could n't help but be a nice guy , especially in a bar . The effort he was making made Jack Rhyce afraid that he might be overdoing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben 's glance . " Say , boy , " Big Ben said , " come on over here . Let 's do a song number for the crowd . This fellow can really sing , folks . " " Oh , no , " Jack said . " I might break my larynx . " Now that they knew he had a comic streak everything he said was funny . Ruth Bogart gave him a playful push . " Oh , go ahead , Jack , " she said . " You can sing just as well as he can . " There is nothing harder in the world than to give a convincing imitation of being drunk . Jack Rhyce was wise enough not to try . " Well , let me have a double Scotch first , " he said , " so I can halfway catch up with things . " Big Ben gave a hearty whoop of laughter . Jack Rhyce tossed  |p202off  the drink when it was handed to him in three quick swallows . He did not need to ask for another because someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two quick slugs had surprisingly little effect . They only served to make everything more hideously grotesque , at the same time bringing the faces around him into clearer definition . Big Ben was holding a halfemptyhighball glass in exactly the expert way that an abstemiousperson handles a drink at a cocktail party . You could always pick a drinker from a nondrinker from the way he held his glass . Big Ben , in spite of all his noise , was cold sober , but his sobriety had been hard to detect because his spirits and elation were not normal . Elation was exactly the word , the sort that came after emergence from danger . The truth was that Big Ben was happy , and also he must have felt completely safe . Like Jack Rhyce , he must have examined the hotel guests and must have concluded that there was not a cough in a carload . " Well , I do feel better now , " Jack said . Big Ben patted his shoulder affectionately ; in return Jack Rhyce gave him an affectionate punch on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no softness in Big Ben 's midsection , as he had observed already at Wake . He was more of a wrestler than a boxer , but these were not the right thoughts for the moment , when even a thought could be detected if it influencedattitude . " Say , " Big Ben said , and his voice had a wheedling note in it , " now you 've got yourself lubricated up , how about a little harmonizing ? Ted here can play almost anything on a squeeze box . How about a piece from The Red Mill ? How about Every Day Is Ladies ' Day with Me ' ? Huh , Jack ? "  | " Oh , say , " Jack Rhyce said , " why that old chestnut ? " " Aw , come on , " Big Ben said . " It 's got real melody . It 's a swell song . " " Why is it you have this yen for The Red Mill , " Jack Rhyce asked , " when it was written before you and I were born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " I know , " he said . " It do n't sound reasonable , does it . Yet it 's a kind of a theme song with me . Will you sing it with me if I tell you why ? " His invitation , which included the group around them again , had a professional tone . He was a born master of ceremonies , and in the relief he must have been feeling , he might have dropped his guard . " Why , sure , " Jack said , " if it 's a good yarn . " " Aw , shucks , " Big Ben said , " it is n't much of a one  --  just kid stuff . You know how it is when you 're a kid , how things kind of happen so you do n't forget . " His voice was eager and appealing . " It was senior year in this Baptist college down South . . . . It 's a kind of corny yarn , now I think of it . . . . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had this pretty daughter with golden hair . Well , my folks were poor , in the missionarybusiness actually , and I was sort of shy back then . For two years I used to walk past her house most every night , withoutdaring to knock on the door , and then comes Senior year . That autumn when I 'd sort of built up my ego by playing football , why I walked up the front stoop and rang the bell , and there she was all alone , and she asked me to come inside . Well , I was shy , but she asked me if I liked hearing music on the phonograph . It was one of those kind you wind with a crank , andp204there were lots of records belonging to the old man that went a long ways back . Well , we played them for a while , and then she put on this Red Mill record , and held my hand , and then  --  well , we kinda got to loving each other with that old Red Mill playing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the hell out , and I never saw her again , but that 's how I remember The Red Mill . " Big Ben 's voice grew softer . " And I have n't forgot that old aristocratic bastard , either . " He had completely held his audience , and there were sympatheticmurmurs applauding his tale of young frustration . The pride and sensitiveness that had run all through the incident had revealed themselves only in the last sentence . Something had happenedthen , something more than was told , of course , but The Red Mill was its monument to a new beginning , and the music of early youth was always the best music . Big Ben shrugged his shoulders . " Then after that , before the war , I was with a sort of musical caravan , and what should happen  --  there was The Red Mill . Anyway , it kind of stays with me . " " That 's quite a story , Ben , " Jack Rhyce said , and he meant it . He had learned a lot from the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's make a quick switch . Stand up here , fella . Let 's show ' em . Strike up the band . Every Day Is Ladies ' Day with Me . ' " Bill Gibson was dead at Chrysanthemum Rest . Their arms were draped over each other 's shoulders as they sang , and jack knew the words better than Big Ben . And my pleasure it is double if they come to me in trouble , For I always find a way to make them smile , the little darlings !  |p205A|p|plause  came from all over the bar when they had finished . Show business was written all over Big Ben when he took in the applause . " Say , Jack , " he said , " if we only had straw hats and canes , we could soft-shoe it , could n't we ? " If you played the game you had to play it through . " We do n't need hats and canes , " Jack Rhyce said . " Why , we do n't sure enough , " Big Ben said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't a bad show either . Jack Rhyce had to admit that they both had an unusual gift of comic interpolation . In fact there was one moment when he was almost tempted to join in the laughter of the crowd as he watched Big Ben slip deliberately and recover himself . Actually his impulse to laugh died when he saw Ruth Bogart 's expression as she watched them . Then an instant later he picked out the face of Mr. Moto . Mr. Moto was standing near the street entrance of the bar . Jack Rhyce remembered being ashamed of Mr. Moto 's seeing him making a deliberatefool of himself , but then there was no reason why Mr. Moto should not have been there since he had been given the evening off . After all , enough was enough . Jack Rhyce was never surer of the truth of that aphorism than when the dance was over . He looked once toward the spot where Mr. Moto had been standing , but the Japanese was gone and Jack Rhyce could hardly blame him . " Well , folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice seeing you . Come on , Ruth . Let 's say good night . " They had done what was necessary . They had showed up in the bar and the clock showed it was ten minutes to twelve . Hep206could tell from the tight grip of her hand when they walked toward the Cozy Nook ell that her nervous resistance was wearingthin . " Jack , " she said , as they closed the door of their room . They had not spent much time there , but the edges of unfamiliarity had been rounded off already , and they were both through with cover for the moment . " Just a minute before you say anything , " he told her , removing his coat and tie . " Just let me wash the touch of that goon off me first . I 'm sorry , Ruth . " " You need n't be sorry , " she said . " Nobody could have done better than you did , Jack . " She was standing just where he had left her when he came back rubbing his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " you 've washed the lipstick off and now you wo n't have anything to remember me by . Please unzip the back of my dress . I do n't know why people always sell unzippabledresses . " " Maybe they do it to get girls into trouble , " he said . " Jack , " she said , " do n't you think it would look better if we turned out the lights ? " " How do you mean , " he asked , " look better ? " " More conventional , " she said , " more what 's expected of us . We do n't know who 's watching or listening . " " Just get it into your head , " he said , " no one 's watching or listening . We 're out of this as of now . " " But it wo n't be long , " she said . " And it would be better if you did turn out the lights . I must look like hell . " " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I feel like hell , " she answered.  | " All right , " he told her , " I do n't blame you . So do I. We have n't exactly been playing charades tonight . " He turned out the lights , except the one in the bathroom , but he could still see her standing there . " We used to play charades at home , " she said . " Did you ever play them ? " " If it 's just the same with you , " he said , " let 's not get reminiscing . Why , yes , I used to play charades with the banker 's daughter , dear , until the banker threw me out . " " Jack , " she said , " was n't it God-awful ? " " Yes , " he said . " Jack , " she said , " I do n't know anything about Bill Gibson 's setup here , do you ? " " No , " he answered , " and we wo n't now Bill 's dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are we going to do ? " It was the question he had been asking himself for quite a while , because he was left with nothing , now that Bill Gibson was dead  --  no contacts , unless he communicated with home , and that was far too dangerous under the circumstances . " I do n't know , " he said , " but maybe we 'll think of something in the morning . " " Is that the best you can do ? " she asked . " Come here . Come closer . I want to ask you something . " If only because they were in the same predicament , they were close enough already . " I have n't got any bright answers , " he said . " I could n't win any giveaway show tonight . " " Why did they kill Bill ? " she whispered . " Because he knew something they did n't want passed on , " hep208said . " You know that . That 's always why we kill people in this racket . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't tell us , " he said , " but we 've got to try to find out , come morning . " " Jack , " she said , " was n't it awful ? " He felt her arms steal around his neck , and she buried her face against his shoulder . " Go ahead and cry if it does you any good , " he said . " I do n't blame you , Ruth . " " I 'm not going to cry , " she said , " but I 'm glad you 're here , Jack . " " I wish you were n't , " he said . " Oh , Jack , " she said , " I do n't think that 's very polite , consideringeverything . " " I mean it 's too damn dangerous here , " he said . " Let 's face it . I mean I love you , Ruth  --  and I 'm not pretending . " " Well , " she said . " I 'd almost given up hoping that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " he told her . " But it 's a damn fool thing for anyone like me to say . " He was right about that last statement . It was bad for business to fall in love , especially with anyone like her , but he had said it , and there they were , alone together with their secrets , miles away from any help except what they could give each other . Miles away from anything that made for common sense . . . . Hindsight was always simpler than foresight . Later it was easy enough to tell himself that no one should rely on convictionsthat had no solid foundation of fact  --  except that hisp209belief that they were in the clear did have its own foundation : he could always return to the indisputable point that Bill Gibson would not have been killed in the way he had if anyone had suspectedwho Jack Rhyce and Ruth Bogart were . As a matter of fact , time was to prove that Rhyce had been right in these assumptions . But still he should have allowed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after finding the Japanese in his room , and particularly after the incident of the footstep on the temple path . The trouble was , there had been so much on his mind , that he had finally yielded to the temptation of blackingout the whole problem for a few hours that night , which had been inexcusable . You always paid for such a thing as that in some coin or other , but he never dreamed that he would pay so soon . In fact , he did not even bother to do anything about the lock on the bedroom door , because he was so sure that they would be undisturbed . The hour when he was awakened must have been shortly after two . The two double whiskies he had drunk may have made him sleep more soundly than usual , but he doubted it . The truth was that the callers were such expert operators that even if he had propped a chair beneath the doorknob they could have handled it without waking him . He had often heard older men in the bureau , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . They loved intricacies , and if they knew what they wanted , their patience was inordinate . Actually the first he knew of anything wrong was when they switched on the ceiling lights . It was the light rather than the click of the switch that had aroused him . In the instant his sight was adjusting to the light , he was on his feet . In fact , before hep210could see clearly , he heard someone speaking just in front of him . " Please , Mr. Rhyce , no noise , please . " Then everything was cleared . Mr. Moto and two other stocky Japanese in blue serge suits were in the bedroom . Operator was written all over them . Ruth Bogart , in her twin bed next the wall , reached for her handbag , but the man nearest to her knocked it from her hand . " Quiet , please , " Mr. Moto said . All the previous awkwardness had gone from his voice . His English had become impeccable , and his accent was highly educated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here will hand you your clothes . " Mr. Moto smiled politely . " He was a valet once for a member of your cabinetin Washington  --  before the war , of course . " The loquaciousness disturbed jack Rhyce because it indicated Mr. Moto 's belief that he held the cards . So far no one had pulled a gun , which also meant that the situation was in hand . Jack Rhyce wished he was not barefoot in pajamas , and he also wished that he could keep down his rising anger . " I 'll give you and your chumps just ten seconds to clear out of here , " he said , " or else by God I 'll throw you out , right through that window . " The three Japanese were a crowd , but given luck , jack Rhyce believed that he might do it . Mr. Moto raised his hand in a placating gesture . " Please , " he said , " make no disturbance , Mr. Rhyce , or I shall be obliged to call for the police . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you little yellow bas-tard ? " " Please do not be insulting , " Mr. Moto said , " though I canp211understand how you feel at the moment , Mr. Rhyce . I mentioned the police . " " Oh , " Jack Rhyce said , " so you 're a cop , are you ? " Mr. Moto looked grave and shook his head . Not what you call a cop , " he said . " I am just what you are , Mr. Rhyce , and you and I do not want cops , do we ? I only want a quiet talk with you . It would be a pity if I were to call the police . " " Go ahead and do it , " Jack Rhyce said , " and I 'll use the same word to you again . Go ahead and do it , you impertinent little yellow bastard . Call in your police . " He had made the Japanese angry , which was perhaps a useless luxury . " I do not understand , " Mr. Moto said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Rhyce , and your work was very good last evening  --  but not the police , Mr. Rhyce . I should have to tell them that you and the lady here had murdered Mr. Gibson . I think you would help me rather than have me do that , Mr. Rhyce . " Then Jack Rhyce realized that he was in grave difficulty and the expressions of the two assistants confirmed the fact . " Well , well , " he said , " so that 's the picture , is it ? All right , tell your goddam valet to hand me my pants and a clean white shirt . From the way he looks I 'll bet he stole the plans for the wrong battleship , even if he could find his way around Washington . " There was no change in the three foreign faces watching him . He grinned at Ruth Bogart . " Anyway , " he said , " the house detectiveshave n't got us , Ruth . " While he pulled on his trousers over his pajamas , Mr. Moto rubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I understand how a sudden intrusioncan be upsetting . " The first surprise was leaving jack Rhyce . Although he still needed time , the directions were growing clearer . He pointed to his shoes and socks , and when they were handed to him he sat on the edge of his bed and stole another glance at Ruth Bogart . The whiteness of her face showed that they both were beginning to see where the Japanese were fitting in . " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said . " Please , may I repeat , you did it very well ? So neat with the pills , so nice with the needle  --  so nice to be a big strong man , Mr. Rhyce . No reason to tell the police . Your chief and my chief would prefer it otherwise , do n't you think ? " Jack Rhyce pulled a clean shirt over his head , tightened his belt carefully , took the tie that was handed him and knotted it deliberately . Mr. Moto had not moved his glance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had been in Mr. Moto 's place . " Not the belt , please , " Mr. Moto said , " Mr. Rhyce . I should rather hear Big Ben strike only over the BBC . " He heard Ruth Bogart draw in her breath , and her mind must have gone , as his had , to Fisherman 's Wharf in San Francisco . " So that 's the way the ball bounces , " Jack Rhyce said . " You 've got me down for Big Ben ? " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said . " Your coat , please , Mr. Rhyce . " Jack Rhyce snatched the coat from the blue-suited man . " I 'll put that on myself , " he said . He had a sudden unreasoning fear that if he were helped they might pinion his arms behind him . " We will leave quietly , " Mr. Moto said . " I never like to dop213more than is necessary . That is why Miss Bogart will stay here . She will understand that it will do no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo myself in the morning . " Ruth Bogart cleared her throat . " You do n't know what you 're doing , " she began . It was not the time to break security ; indeed it was still a question whether they would have been believed if they had attempted to explain . Jack Rhyce smiled at her and shook his head . " I do n't really think there 's much you can do , Ruth , " he said , " the way the ball is bouncing . " " But , Jack , " she said , " they 're going to  --  " " Let 's not be mind readers , " he said . Mr. Moto rubbed his hands together again . " It is so true , " he said , " what you say about the ball bouncing . One day it is you . One day it is me . The young lady is not important , Mr. Rhyce . I can give you my assurance that I will see her off for home , myself , from the airport tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the men . " I shall give it back also tomorrow . " " Okay , " Jack Rhyce said . " Do you mind if I ask you one question ? " " If it is short , " Mr. Moto answered . " The sooner we leave the better , Mr. Rhyce . " Jack Rhyce nodded toward the curtained windows . " What makes you think I killed that man down there ? " " Because he knew too much about something you know , too , Mr. Rhyce , " Mr. Moto said . " We 're going where we can have a quiet talk , and I think you will tell us what he knew before we are finished , Mr. Rhyce . Moscow does not know all the tricks . "  | " You ought to know I 'm not a graduate from there , " Jack Rhyce said . " Well , as long as I have your word about Miss Bogart  --  " " I repeat , " Mr. Moto said , " never do anything unnecessary . Why should she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhyce ? " " Jack  --  " Ruth Bogart began . Her voice was dangerously loud . It was not a time for handsome speeches , and besides , everything was strictly business . " Do n't , Ruth , " he said  --  " but it 's been nice to have known you . Come on , let 's go . " He still was not recovered from surprise , but he began to see that there were several reasons why they should have mistaken him for Big Ben . Everything , he knew , was very dangerous . They walked in a compact , softly stepping group down a flight of stairs and out into the night . " By the way , " Jack Rhyce said , " what time is it ? " Mr. Moto turned his head quickly . " Why ? " he asked . " Have you an appointment , Mr. Rhyce ? " Jack Rhyce did not answer . It was dark and very still . The hotel and the small town around it seemed sound asleep . The car that had brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in the front with me , please , " Mr. Moto said . " The men will be in the back . One of them will have you covered . He is a good man with a pistol . " Jack got into the car without speaking . Mr. Moto took the wheel . The place where they went was not far from the hotel . It was a substantially built Japanese house surrounded by a high wall . The car stopped at the entrance door . " You will step out quietly , please , " Mr. Moto said.  |p215Jack  Rhyce gave way to a purely professional piece of exasperation . " Tell that goon of yours to take his hand off me , " he said . " I can still get out of a car . " A light burning above the doorway showed the raised platformwhere one sat to remove one 's shoes , but there was no neat row of shoes such as one might have seen if the house had been occupied . Its dark windows and the unkempt condition of the shrubbery indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been opened only for this special occasion . Mr. Moto gave an order and one of the men opened the front door , at the same time switching on the lights in the entrance hall . " The man will not touch you , " Mr. Moto said . " Walk just behind me into the house , please . It belongs to a Baron . An Americangeneral had it as a resthouse during the Occupation . Many of its rooms are European . " Jack Rhyce was not interested in the ownership or the architectureof the house , nor did he have time to think of the incongruityof what had happened to him . The dark night , the strangeness , and the belief that time might be running short were things that one thought of later . There was a distance of about six paces of gravel driveway between the car and the lighted hallway of the house . Mr. Moto walked a pace ahead of him , not bothering to look back , which showed that he trusted the man who was walking a pace behind , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as jack could tell from the sound of his steps , and if you held a gun at someone 's back , one of the first principles was to keep a decent interval . If one debated on whether or not to take a chance , one alwaysended with indecision . In the last analysis it was the con/tempt in Mr. Moto 's tone that made Jack take the chance , in spite of the obvious risks involved . He whirled on the ball of his right foot , and he was correct that the man in the blue suit was too close . Jack Rhyce had his wrist in his left hand and the barrel of the pistol diverted to the ground in the split second before he brought his fist across to the jaw with all the momentum of his body behind it . The pistol exploded at the same moment . Then the hand that held it relaxed , and Jack Rhyce had the weapon  --  from its size and weight , another one of those Berettas . Mr. Moto turned with the light of the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall we leave it the way it is ? " he said . " I told you I did n't want that man crowding me  --  and tell the other one to stop . " The other blue suit was back in the doorway , and Mr. Moto gave a curt order . " I am so sorry he annoyed you , " Mr. Moto said . " Yes , he was very clumsy . " " Not clumsy , " Jack Rhyce said , " just overanxious . Let 's not you and me get overanxious . I 'll get you anyway before you and the other one get me . " They stood completely motionless for seconds that seemed to Jack Rhyce to last for a long while . " Yes , " Mr. Moto said . " Yes , and what do you suggest ? " " You tell that friend of yours behind you , " Jack Rhyce said , " to come over here and help his friend . He 's coming to , now . I do n't like being treated this way , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him so that it was impossible to see his face , and now one could gauge his reactiononly from his voice.  | " Yes , " Mr. Moto said , " yes ? " The rising inflection of the last word turned it into a question . " You tell your two people to keep out of the way , " Jack Rhyce said , " and I 'll go into that house with you . I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me . I 'm not Big Ben , and I did n't kill Bill Gibson . Frankly , he was my boss . " The light from the doorway was on his face , and he still could see only the shadow of Mr. Moto , but part of the tension was gone . The disarming of the guard had done it , and there was doubt in Mr. Moto 's voice . " You say you are not Big Ben ? " " You 're damned well right I 'm not , " Jack answered . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came up here to meet me . He was dead by the time we got there , and I want to know what he knew as much as you do . Maybe we can do some business if we go inside . " He heard Mr. Moto sigh softly . " You may put the pistol of the clumsy man in your pocket , Mr. Rhyce , " Mr. Moto said . " If you gave it to him now he would kill himself for shame , but I am grateful to him for his clumsiness . You would of course have shot it out with me if you had been Big Ben . " " Yes , " Jack Rhyce said , and he sighed , too , now that the tensionwas easing . " That 's exactly the point I 've been trying to make , and I had to move damn fast to make it . Here , take the gun . I do n't need it any more . I never did like the balance of these Italian rods . " He tossed the pistol on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I am very mortified that I should be so mistaken . Excuse me , please . "  | " That 's all right , " Jack Rhyce said . " I 've been sort of trying to explain you myself the Iast two days . It 's too bad we did n't know sooner we were after the same boy . " " It was so very stupid of me , " Mr. Moto said again . " I was so stupid , I think , because I have tried too hard , and thought too hard . So you were after Big Ben , too ? " " Yes , " Jack Rhyce said , and everything was easy now , and relaxed . " That 's what I was sent over from the States for . Gibsonwas worried and wanted help . "  |p219EITHER  tell the whole truth or none at all was an almost infalliblebusiness maxim . Under present circumstances , even though the position of the Japanese was still equivocal , the only solution was frankness . At least they were after the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man on the ground groaned and struggled to his hands and knees . Jack put his hands beneath his arms and pulled him to his feet . After all , there were times when one could afford to be cordial . " Out like a light , were n't you , Mac ? " Jack Rhyce said , and slapped him affectionately on the back . " Never mind . We 're all pals now . Your gun 's right over there . " Mr. Moto laughed in a completely genuine way . " His English is not good . Tell him in Japanese . " " I apologize for your discomfort , " Jack Rhyce said in Japanese . " So it was the tea and the coffee back there at the hotel that gave me away on the language , was it ? " Mr. Moto laughed again , and both the men in blue serge smiled . Everything could change very quickly in Japan . " Oh , no , " Mr. Moto said . " Earlier , Mr. Rhyce . " " Earlier ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burma , Mr. Rhyce , " Mr. Moto said . " We had your name on file . Japanese linguist , born in Japan . I even had a glimpse of you once at Myitkyina . " Mr. Moto laughed heartily . " I didp220not speak because I was moving the other way , but I rememberedyou when I saw you at the airport , Mr. Rhyce . " Everyone laughed heartily . After all , the war was over . " The word always was that you people had good Intelligence , " Jack Rhyce said , " but I did n't know you were working so hard at it now . " " Oh , not so hard , " Mr. Moto said , " with shortness of funds and the misfortunes . Poor Japan . We would not have made a mistake such as I have made tonight , before the war . The machinerywas not bad before the war . " " Still , there was the German , Sorge , " Jack Rhyce said . " Oh , yes , Sorge , " Mr. Moto said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent ; but do n't forget , please , we caught Sorge . And did you Americans catch Dr. Fuchs ? And the British who always boast so much about their Intelligence  --  did they stop Burgess or MacLean ? So hard , so very difficult to manage everything . " It was a relief to talk naturally , without being under the necessity of cover . That Mr. Moto spoke so frankly indicated more than professional courtesy . It showed a colleague 's respect . " It 's a tough life all right , " Jack Rhyce said . " It 's beginning to get me down these days . " " Get you down ? " Mr. Moto said . " I wish so much I could visit your great country more often . I can not keep up with the idiom now . Before everything was so unhappy , I was over once a year at least , New York , Washington , or Honolulu . Even when my duties were in Paris and London I endeavored to spend a week or two of observation in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peach-crop 's always fine , is n't it , Mr. Rhyce ? " " I wish I knew where you picked that one up , " Jack Rhyce said.  | " A song from The Red Mill was sung in the third floor corridorof the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco , " Mr. Moto answered , " the evening before you left , Mr. Rhyce . " " You have n't got such a bad setup , have you ? " Jack Rhyce said . " So the Japanese schoolboy tailed me from Fisherman 's Wharf , but you Japs get things twisted . I was up on that floor , all right , but I did n't sing the song . " Mr. Moto sighed . " So sorry I have been so very stupid , " he said . " He was so sure that you were Mr. Ben that when he gave the signal , I came myself to meet you at the airport instead of sending someone else . I mention it only so that you will give me some excuse . But why do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack Rhyce answered . " Because you have n't asked me in . " Mr. Moto drew in his breath in a loud deprecating way . " Oh ! " he said . " The work has got me down , too , as you put it , so that I have lost my manners . This house is only loaned for a purpose for which I am so glad is now not necessary , by a very kind Japanese nobleman . So really little money now that individualscontribute . Poor Japan . He would be honored to know that you have been his guest . Come in , please , and my associates will warm us some saki . Do not be concerned about them . It is only they and me here , and unpleasantnesses are entirely over . Please to enter , Mr. Rhyce , and no need to take off shoes . This part of the Baron 's residence is European . " The lights were on in the hall and also in a large room to the right . It was one of those newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had built in the prosperous years thatp222had preceded the war  --  a house half-European , half-Japanese , that had the schizophrenic quality of so much in present-day Japan . No Japanese , as far as Jack Rhyce knew , ever wishfully inhabited his Western rooms except for reasons of hospitality ; and jack Rhyce did not blame them , because the European sectionof such houses was usually as ugly and uncomfortable as its Japanese counterpart was beautiful . The house he entered now was no exception . The furnishings of the entrance hall gave forth a musty odor , from age and disuse ; but they had been elaborate once , designed to impress , and perhaps please , the Europeanguest , and also to display the owner 's close acquaintance with Western living . The hall carpet was crimson , sprinkled with fleur-de-lis ; the wallpaper artificial Cordovan leather ; the mirror bad Victorian ; and the chairs golden oak , upholstered with red plush . Mr. Moto must have read the thoughts that ran through Jack 's mind . We used to try so hard , Mr. Rhyce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equally hideous in the parlor , but Americans like chairs . " Several table lamps that were lighted in the cluttered , overdecoratedparlor revealed oil paintings of English cattle , encased in immense gold frames , two pieces of artificial tapestry , tapestry-coveredJacobean chairs and upholstered easy chairs of a turn-of-the-century design . There was also a European fireplace with a coal grate , in which jack Rhyce noticed a coal fire glowing in spite of the hot night . The coffee table had been cleared of its cigarette boxes and impedimenta ; on it were knottedstrings and leather thongs and a pair of handcuffs.  | " Well , well , " Jack Rhyce said , " so you were fixing to have a singing school . " Mr. Moto laughed boisterously . " Ha-ha , " he said , " so nice a way you have of saying funny things , Mr. Rhyce . " He called an order in angry Japanese . " Take these away and bring the saki and cigarettes . Please sit down , Mr. Rhyce . " Jack Rhyce sat down in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that Mr. Moto had called , in a jar with a glaze that looked like celadon . " Beautiful , " Jack Rhyce said , nodding to the jar . " You appreciate it ? " Mr. Moto asked . " I am so pleased . It has been in the Baron 's family for many hundred years . The Baron would be pleased to present it to you , I think . " " What makes you think so ? " Jack asked . " Maybe he 's anti-American . " " Oh , no , " Mr. Moto said . " He is my cousin . You enjoy the wine ? " He was grateful for the wine from the fragile thimble of a cup that one of the men offered him . " These two boys you have with you , " Jack Rhyce said , " look as though they had been in the Imperial Marines  --  very tough , I mean . " " So nice of you to notice , " Mr. Moto said . " I hope you like the wine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's nice and hot . I only wish it were a Texas jigger . " " A Texas jigger ? " Mr. Moto said , and he burst into appropriatelaughter when Jack Rhyce explained the phrase . " Please tellp224the Marines in Japanese . They will appreciate about the jigger . One of them will stand beside you , ready to fill the cup . " Even into that European room there had crept an atmosphere of Oriental hospitality , politeness and good manners . " To happy peace between the United States and poor Japan , " Mr. Moto said . " Very foolish men made the war . Ha-ha . Nearly all of them are dead . " Jack Rhyce drank a second thimbleful of wine and held out his cup for more . " Judging from my short stay here , " he said , " it looks to me as though Japan is going to make out pretty well . " " You think ? " Mr. Moto said . " There are so many dangers , but I am glad you think . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is engaged in my own line of work . Poor Japan . We had such a very lovely Intelligence system before the war . " " We heard you were starting work again , " Jack Rhyce said . " Frankly , I did n't know it would be so good . " " Oh , thank you , " Mr. Moto said , " but only in such a small way now . So little money . Let me see . There were once such nice men in your Intelligence in Washington . Do you remember Colonel Bryson ? He was such a lovely man . I was so sorry he broke his neck in Vienna . Then there was Mr. Makepeace . They used to call him Tommy . What has become of him , I wonder ? " Obviously Mr. Moto was checking on Jack Rhyce 's background , and Jack Rhyce was relieved that he could come up with an answer . " He was in Prague six years ago , " Jack Rhyce said , " but since then Mr. Makepeace has not been heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , ha-ha , you can not blamep225poor Japan for Mr. Makepeace . So too bad so many lovely people can not live forever . " " That 's quite a thought , " Jack Rhyce said , " but we do n't , you know . " The social amenities were nearly over . Mr. Moto waved to one of the attendants for a match and lighted a cigarette . " And you ? " he asked , pointing to the box . " Thanks , " Jack Rhyce said . " I do n't use them . " " So right of you , " Mr. Moto said . " So very , very right . I was taught that when I first entered the Intelligence . In the late twenties , it was . My Chief , dear old Mr. Naguna , never smoked cigarettes , for they left untidy traces . Dear old Mr. Naguna . Some more wine , Mr. Rhyce ? " " Thanks , I could do with a little more , " Jack Rhyce said . Mr. Moto gestured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I told him to stay near you , Mr. Rhyce , but in his simple brain he was thinking that you must have had enough , just as in his simple brain he thought that you would not turn on him as you did outside , because he had a weapon directed at your back . Poor Japan . We never can understand how you Westerners can drink so much and not lose your wits . Confidentially , that is why the German Sorge puzzled our Mr. Naguna for several years . It did not seem possible that Mr. Sorge could be brilliant , with his drinking . He was like a figure in a Kabuki play . " " I told you I could do with a drink , " Jack Rhyce said . " I did n't mean a teaspoonful at a time . " Mr. Moto laughed . The Japanese sooner or later laughed too much . " Mr. Rhyce , I like you so very much , " he said , " because youp226are so  --  doctrinaire , as the French say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , out of doors , was very beautiful . I could admire it even when I did not know what might follow . But I did know that the move was not Russian  --  at least not what the procedure was in Moscow before the war , Mr. Rhyce . " " Thanks , " Jack Rhyce said . " They 'll be pleased to know that , back home . " Mr. Moto drew in on his cigarette and passed his hand over his closely cropped , graying hair . " When I see someone like you , so bright and young , in the profession , there is some excuse for my mistakes , " he said . " I have never been familiar with Western features , but it would be my fallible opinion that you have a kind face , Mr. Rhyce . Please , I hope you will treat my errors kindly . I did not have the benefit of records because ours were destroyed in the bombing , and such as remained , which we did not burn ourselves , were taken over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but poor japan . Therefore , I can only rely on memory  --  but you were in Japan until the age of five . You were in Japanese language school in Colorado , because one of my own young men taught you and reported you as far above the average . Please do not make a mental note . Your Counterintelligence found him out . Then you were in combat Intelligence in Burma . Reports that came later said that your conduct with our people was most correct . Then there is an alert in my echelon , just as there must have been in yours . Elements in the Politburo were moving in . Poor Japan . So many people , so poor . So much discontent . The intellectuals so apres guerre . Orders to look for a new personality . An American on file . The name on the intercept  --  Bigp227Ben . Popular . Entertainment organizer , like someone on your stage , perhaps , or one of your motion picture entertainers who loved Russia . Look out for this American  --  Big Ben , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that old entertainment called Red Mill . I heard it in New York when a very small boy , when my father was in the consulate in New York . " " That sure dates you , " Jack Rhyce said . " That show opened in x906 in old New York . " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said . " But they still had the tune in 1912 . Imaginemy joy to hear of you from San Francisco . So pleased when I saw you at the airport . So pleased about the Friendship League which we have watched with interest . So pleased about your week-end excursion , just where Mr. Gibson was going . So pleased when you and the pretty Miss Bogart entered ChrysanthemumRest  --  and then to find you are American Intelligence is difficult . My mind , I know , was too made up . I should have kept an open mind , but you will admit that everything did fit . " Mr. Moto paused . He had , after all , made his point . " Do n't blame yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're not Russian . I 've been worried about that from the first time you picked me up . " " Not Russian , " Mr. Moto shook his head . " Nationalist Japan Party , Mr. Rhyce . Fascist , perhaps , but pro-Emperor , anti-Communist . So much trouble  --  poor Japan . But when the typhoon ceases , back will spring the bamboo . " An earnestness in Mr. Moto 's words made Jack Rhyce realize that he might be hearing a true explanation of the Japanese mood and the Japanese aspirations . " Are Nationalists anti-American these days ? " he asked  |p228Mr  . Moto shook his head vigorously . " Not now , " he said . " Not enlightened ones . The United States is so very useful . Later perhaps , but now now . So silly to shoot Santa Claus , as your politicians used to say when I was in Washington . You see , I 'm being very frank , Mr. Rhyce . " " I 'd say you give every appearance of being , " Jack Rhyce said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the word did not exist in the Orient . The difficulties among most people always lay in a misconception of each other 's values . There was always an ultimate shift of meaning  --  even between Americans and Englishmen , who thought as nearly alike as any two nations . " I am being frank , " Mr. Moto said , " because I hope so much that we will be temporary partners , Mr. Rhyce . There are groups here on the Left , and on the Right , too , so anxious to arouse feelingagainst America . And the plain Japanese man can change so quickly . " Mr. Moto paused , and while Jack Rhyce waited for him to continue , he had a moment to speculate on Mr. Moto 's background . He came from the old aristocracy . He must have been educated abroad , probably in an Eastern American university . There had been all sorts of strains and cleavages in his mental upbringing , but there could never have been any wavering in loyalty . He stood for Old Japan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Moto said . " That is the trouble with fanatics . One should always multiply their danger by ten or twenty , I believe . At the moment we are as anxious as you are to uphold American prestige , and I am willing to pool information if you are , Mr. Rhyce. "  |p229Jack  appeared to hesitate , even though the man seated opposite must have known already that he had no choice . With Bill Gibsondead , he did not know the organization , and things were closing in so rapidly that the only possible hope of achieving successwas to rely on outside chance . " I do n't see why we should n't do business , " he said slowly , " and maybe I know a few things you do n't . " He paused again . It was better to start slowly . " I had no briefing from Mr. Gibson , you understand . That was to have occurred up here . He only told me that he was being followed , and intimated that he was in danger . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Mr. Moto said . " Yes , so very right . " He did not blame Mr. Moto for looking discouraged . It was time to hurry on and show that he had some value . " Still Mr. Gibson sent us back a few facts , " Jack Rhyce went on . " This man , Big Ben , has been meeting a Russian agent named Skirov at intervals . Do you know this Skirov ? " Mr. Moto 's features sharpened . " Not prewar , " he said , " an apres guerre Russian , very well trained , and very dangerous , Mr. Rhyce . I 'm sorry we have not seen him , but I believe he had been in Japan . " " We rate him above this Big Ben , " Jack Rhyce said . " Skirov has a very high priority back in our home office . " " He is very well trained , " Mr. Moto said , " a man of great potentials . We have tried very hard to find him . " " This Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes , " Mr. Moto answered . " Why are you smiling , Mr. Rhyce ? " " About this Skirov , " Jack Rhyce said . " I 've never seen him , but we have a photograph and an accurate description . It mightp230amuse you to know that when I found you up there in our room I had a hunch for a few minutes that you might be Skirov . " Mr. Moto smiled politely , but Jack Rhyce thought that he was startled . " So funny how often people confuse things when they get fixed ideas , " Mr. Moto said . " That was my difficulty with you , Mr. Rhyce . I had such very fixed ideas . What other information did Mr. Gibson send back home ? " " This meeting between Skirov and Big Ben , " Jack Rhyce said , " Bill Gibson believed that there was one coming up , and there was something so important about it that he was upset . He had learned something new , but he did not have time to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Mr. Moto lighted another cigarette . " I think I will have another cup of wine , " he said . " Perhaps I know somewhat more than you about what was troubling Mr. Gibson . I am sorry , of course , that you do not know your apparatus here . It is a deep disappointment to me . I was hoping we could have profitable exchange of facts . " " You mean you wo n't tell me any more because you do n't think I know anything worth while ? Is that it ? " Jack Rhyce asked . " Yes , " Mr. Moto said , " so sorry , Mr. Rhyce . " Jack Rhyce allowed a few moments to elapse before he spoke . It was clearer than ever to him that he could achieve nothing unless he had co-operation . There was still a risk , but it was a necessary one . " Okay , " he said . " Suppose I told you I 've found Big Ben . Suppose I could say that I could finger him for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think was on my boss 's mind ? " Hep231had not anticipated the full effect of what he had said . The Japanesegave a violent start before he could conceal his excitement . " How very nice , " Mr. Moto said . " You mean he 's here inJapan now ? I am so anxious for your answer , Mr. Rhyce . " Jack paused again . Now that they each had something thatthe other wanted he was certain that they could do business . " You tell me what Big Ben and this Skirov are going to do , " he said , " and I 'll tell you who this Big Ben is . Is it a deal ? " " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said , and there was no doubt that theywould do business . " This Russian Skirov , do you know him ? " " I know all about him , " Jack Rhyce said . " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said . " You were in Moscow in 1946 , and you speak Russian very nicely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molotov in 1946 . You said all men are brothers . " Jack Rhyce winced at Mr. Moto 's words . It was growing clearer every minute why Mr. Moto should have confused him with Big Ben . " Just how the hell did you know that ? " he asked . Mr. Moto 's hand fluttered to the lapel of his coat , and his fingersmoved softly over the cloth . " From a Chinese friend , " he said . " We still have a few contacts . We have to know what is happening , as best we can . Poor Japan . " Jack Rhyce still spoke deliberately . The value of time was differentin the East from what it was in the West , and it was never wise to be overeager . " I 'm not so sorry for poor Japan as I was before I met you , " he said . " What is it that 's so important about this Skirov meet-ing ? "  |p232A  slight shifting of Mr. Moto 's glance showed that he did not know all the answers either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Moto said . " As you know yourself , it is hard to break the Communist security . The date is three days off . I 'm so afraid that Mr. Gibson knew , or he would still be living . Our present information is that they are planning some coup that would have serious political repercussionsthat would adversely affect your country , I am afraid . " Jack Rhyce took his delicate porcelain wine cup from the table . He sipped the warm wine very slowly . " You mean some sort of revolution ? " he asked . He knew that the question was not so preposterous as it sounded , because in the past there had been political upheavals in Japan , as sudden and violent as the island earthquakes . " No , " Mr. Moto said , " not Communist revolution . The pictureis not yet set for that , but something that will cause popular disturbance , something that we think would be anti-American . " He paused and laughed in the apologetic way of his countrymen when they were about to impart bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Rhyce , and afterwards public demon-strations . " There was sense in everything that was said . Political assassination , like public suicide , had often been an instrument of Japanesepolicy . One only had to turn the clock back as far as 1936 to recall the killings by the army clique . " Who 's going to get murdered ? " Jack Rhyce asked . " We hope to find out , " Mr. Moto said . " It would be a murder , if I may venture to guess , that would be ascribed to United States imperialism ; one of a liberal politician ; but we do notp233know whom . But we do think we know the date  --  three days from now . " Bill Gibson must have known the date as well . Jack Rhyce was trying to put together again the details of that hurried call on the day of their arrival , the battered Chevrolet with the Beretta in the glove compartment , and to connect them with his visit to the Asia Friendship League . " Do you know a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who is heading the Asia Friendship League now ? He was transferred recently from Cambodia , I think . " Mr. Moto raised his eyebrows . " I know , " he said . " You spent the day with Mr. Pender before you drove here , Mr. Rhyce . " " That 's right , " Jack Rhyce said . " Have you any information on him ? " " He is a very naughty man , " Mr. Moto said . " His alias is Harry Wise . Hank is his cover name in the apparatus . Does that mean anything to you , Mr. Rhyce ? " Jack Rhyce nodded . The truth was that the name meant quite a lot . " Washington must know him , " Mr. Moto said , " if even our little Bureau knows him . What is it you say in the United States ? They have been moving their first team in here , in the last two weeks . But now I wish to hear from you . Where is Big Ben , Mr. Rhyce ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You said I was singing that Red Mill song in the bar . He was right there with me , and you saw us do that dance together . " Mr. Moto was on his feet before Jack Rhyce had finished.  | " Back at the hotel ? " he spoke almost in a whisper . " Describe i im , please . " " Flight engineer on an American airline . You saw us dancing side by side , " Jack Rhyce said . " Six feet four . Weight about twothirty , sandy hair , bushy eyebrows . Expression affable . In theater business I think , and loves to sing . Favorite tune , The Red Mill . " Mr. Moto slapped his hand against his forehead . " Oh , dear me , " he said . " Oh , yes , I saw you . " " Well , that 's the thumbnail sketch , " Jack Rhyce said . " Does he ring any bell with you , Mr. Moto ? " " Oh , dear me , " Mr. Moto said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is very serious . I 've been so very stupid . We must leave here right away . " " Well , " Jack Rhyce said , " I 'm glad it rings a bell with you . " " Ha-ha , " Mr. Moto said , " yes , it rings a bell . Yes , I shall recognizehim , Mr. Rhyce , because he was the one who fingered you , as they say it in the United States . " " How 's that again ? " Jack Rhyce asked , and he was also on his feet . " Ha-ha ! " Mr. Moto said . " It would be funny if I were not so ashamed . He said he was United States Intelligence , last night , after you sang the song , and he was so very , very nice . He told me you were Big Ben , Mr. Rhyce . " Momentarily Jack Rhyce must have looked as surprised as Mr. Moto had , but he regained his composure immediately . " But when you saw us both together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you afterwards , it must at least have crossed your mind , did n't it , that he could have been Big Ben ? He answered the descriptiontoo , did n't he ? " Mr. Moto eyed him solemnly and nodded in slow agreement.  | " Yes , " he said . " Oh , yes , it crossed my mind . I can make no good excuse for my very great carelessness , except that I was so sure of you already ; but I might say one thing more  --  if you will excuse it , Mr. Rhyce . " " I 'll excuse it ; I 'm still curious , " Jack Rhyce said . Mr. Moto hesitated as though he did not like what he was about to say . " Excuse me , please , " he said . " When in the bar I only felt the more sure I was right in selecting you . You were so much more intelligent , so much more of a trained agent , Mr. Rhyce , so much more dangerous  --  while he , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so like so many of your government officials , Mr. Rhyce . I believed there was no doubt , but please believe I was astute enough to recognize my error when you took my man 's gun away . You would have begun shooting , not have waited to talk , if you had been Big Ben . " Jack Rhyce laughed shortly . There was no time to continue with post-mortems . " That shows he 's smarter than I am , " he said . Never to underestimate the methods of an adversary was a motto of the business . Never to think with pain of what he had done to you , but to try immediately to figure what you could do to him in return . The best way to achieve this last result was to put yourself in his place , and to think like him and not like yourself . Although everyone was fallible , Jack Rhyce could not believe that he had been wrong in his more basic ideas . Big Ben 's move had been inordinately clever , but it was not the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to put oneself inside Big Ben 's mind to see why he had done it , and to estimate what he had won and lost.  |p236Had  he learned through some fluke who the couple in Cozy Nook were , and had he taken that method to knock them out of the game ? This was still unbelievable in Jack Rhyce 's judgment . The nature of the murder disputed the possibility and so did all of Big Ben 's subsequent behavior . Life had made Jack Rhyce enough of a cynic so that he was positive that he could detect sincerity . Big Ben had shown no professional interest in them while they had been in the bar , but something had occurred later to cause a change , and jack Rhyce believed he knew exactly what the circumstance had been . Mr. Moto must have entered the bar while they were singing , and Big Ben 's glance must have picked out the face in the crowd and instantly have identified it . Mr. Moto had been the one who spelled danger , and the improvisationthat Big Ben had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation in it . It was the red herring across the trail , the smoke screen that permitted escape . The idea must have come to Big Ben while each was following the other in that ludicrous soft-shoe dance . The truth was that the sight of Mr. Moto must have come to Big Ben as a stunning shock . He knew who Mr. Moto was . He also must have known that the Japanese were on the lookout for him and had doubtless obtained some sort of description . In fact , Big Ben 's mind probably had moved further . He must have suspected that Mr. Moto had come to the hotel to make contact with Bill Gibson , the American agent . While they were still doingthat soft-shoe dance Big Ben must have been fairly certain that Mr. Moto would visit Chrysanthemum Rest , if he had not done so already . Mr. Moto , as a secret agent , would know that it was murder . Already , in fact , Mr. Moto might be looking for thep237murderer . It was no wonder that Big Ben had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better leave , " Mr. Moto said . " You can continue thinking while we 're moving , Mr. Rhyce . " " All right , " Jack Rhyce said ; " but let 's get our lines straight first . You saw us go into that cottage . You were watching us all evening . Right ? " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said , " watching carefully . " " Then you went into the cottage yourself , " Jack Rhyce said . " Right ? " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said , " so very right . " " When did you get to the bar ? " " When you and he were dancing , " Mr. Moto said . " And after I left , what happened ? " " He walked over to me , " Mr. Moto said . " He asked me if I were looking for Big Ben . " " So he knew who you were , " Jack Rhyce said . " He 'll be halfway to Tokyo by now . He was frightened when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frightened people are the ones who think the fastest . Have you ever noticed that ? " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said . " I am thinking you are unusually intelligent , Mr. Rhyce . " " Thanks , " Jack Rhyce said , " but let 's remember one thing more . He was startled when he saw you . That means he had n't seen you earlier . Do you agree ? " A shadow of doubt crossed Mr. Moto 's face , and he shook his head . " I do n't agree , " he said . " It might also be he knew I was fol/lowing you all the time . Both you and he are such very clever men . " It occurred to Jack that ironically enough both their lines of thinking were academically correct , even though one must be right and the other wrong . " I think you presuppose too much , " Jack Rhyce said . " He 's good , but everyone has failings . Do n't forget , he had a lot on his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you were in the bar , because of one thing my thoughts keep coming back to . " " You are interesting , " Mr. Moto said . " To what do your thoughts go back ? " " If he had known that Miss Bogart and I were up there to meet Bill Gibson , he would n't have killed him that way . Do n't forget he knew who you were . If he had seen you tailing , us he would have made some guesses as to who we were , too . He did n't know . He saw you the first time in the bar . " Mr. Moto nodded , and at least he looked half-convinced . " He 's going to be tougher to catch now , because he knows you 're after him , " Jack Rhyce said . " I suggest that we drive straight back in the morning , and I 'll see Pender first thing Monday , just as though nothing had happened . The name is Ben Bushman . You can check on him at the hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me try Pender . " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said . " And what is it that Mr. Gibson knew that makes him dead tonight ? Fortunately we have people working . I hope in another day to have the full details . " " And you 'll let me know ? " Jack Rhyce said . " Yes , " Mr. Moto said , " with pleasure , Mr. Rhyce . " " I 'll appreciate it , " Jack Rhyce said . " I know you 've got a lotp239to keep you busy , but maybe you would n't mind walking back with me until you can point out the hotel . " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said , " we should be moving before it grows too light . There is only one thing more I have to say . If you 'll excuse me , there may be much trouble . " " Yes , " Jack Rhyce answered . " We 'll have to be ready for it . " Mr. Moto hesitated . He seemed to be considering the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be just as well , " Mr. Moto said , and his words were measured , " if you did not tell Miss Bogart what we have been saying . " " I agree with you , " Jack Rhyce said . " She wo n't be useful here any longer . Suppose we send her home on Monday ? " Mr. Moto nodded . " With so much pleasure , " he said . " She is a very lovely lady . And now we should start back . " It was still dark outside when they passed through the gate to the road , but a refreshing coolness in the air told the hour almost as accurately as a watch . In half an hour the sky would begin to lighten and the stars would disappear.  |p240AVERY  lovely dawn , " Mr. Moto said . " In a few moments I shall let you proceed alone . A lovely time for a walk if one has difficulty with sleeping . That is what I should say to the hall-boy if you should see him . Say it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning . He also is in what you call the business , Mr. Rhyce . " The hotel was dark , except for the lights in the corridors and along the drive . A path with steps to break the steepest portion of its ascent led , through a garden of ponds and tiny cascades bordered with dwarf pines and maple , to the upper terrace . He walked up the path carelessly , as though he had been out for a stroll because of inability to sleep . The terrace with its chairs and wicker tables was dark , except for a light shining over the ell marked Cozy Nook . He was halfway across the terrace when he saw Ruth Bogart , and he knew she had been standing in a shadow watching as he walked up the drive . " Jack , " she whispered , but he was only a hotel guest again . " Why , sweetness , " he said , " were you out looking for me ? I only went out for a little stroll . I thought you were sound asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd told me , dear , " she answered . " It did make me frightened to wake up all alone , and I could n't find you . Are you all right ? " " Oh , yes , dear , " Jack Rhyce said , " and I 'm pretty sleepy now.  |p241It  's only that I do wake up in the middle of the night sometimes , and I do n't believe in these sleeping pills after what I 've read about them . Instead , I go out for a walk . " " But where have you been ? " she said . " I could n't find you anywhere . " " Oh , just down the road a piece , " he said . " It 's lovely country here , and such a clear starlight night . " " You honestly should have told me , " she said . " It was mean of you to make me frightened , dear . " " I 'm sorry , " he said . " But let 's forget about it now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will think we 've had a quarrel or something . " " We really will have a quarrel , " she said , " if you walk out on me again . " They had said enough to explain themselves to anyone who might have been listening , and now they walked carefully up the stairs of the Cozy Nook ell without another word until they were back inside their room . From the way she clung to him he knew she had been afraid for him . It all went to show how unwiseit was for two people in the business to become emotionally involved . Instead of planning objectively , his concern for her threatened to throw other factors out of balance , but there was nothing he could do about it , except to feel more . convinced than ever that she must be kept free from involvement . It was no place for her , and the Chief should never have sent her out . Althoughthey were talking in whispers , they might as well have been speaking out loud . " What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's question . They always knew when something was the matter.  | " It 's all right , " he answered . " There was n't any trouble . " " You made them believe you ? " she asked . " Oh , yes , " he answered . " Did you have to tell them who we were ? " " Oh , I had to tell them this and that , " he said . " But exactly what did you tell them ? " " Oh , this and that , " he answered . " Jack , " she said , " did you find out what Bill Gibson knew ? " " No , " he answered , " not exactly . " " Jack , " she whispered , " you 're not being fair . Why are n't you telling me the truth ? " " You ought to know why , " he answered : " because from now on it 's safer to keep you in the dark . " " I do n't care whether it 's safe or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this with you . " It was bad soap opera , but although he was intellectually aware of it , he was moved by her wish . That was the trouble with beingemotionally involved . " Thanks , " he answered , " but the thing 's moved far enough so that you 're not necessary on the job here any more . I want you to be back in Washington ready to meet me at the airport when I get there . It would be common sense even if I had not lost my head about you , Ruth . " Yet he could not be sure that he was right . If he had not cared about her , it was possible that he might have still thought of her as useful . Anyone as attractive as she , and as good an operator , always did have uses . " This should n't have happened with you and me , " he said . " It was all a great mistake  --  professionally speaking , Ruth . " " I do n't know , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm notp243going back . You 're going to want me around when you know what I know . " " It 's got to be awfully good , " he said . " It is , " she answered . " I know how to get Big Ben , and it 's got to be me , and nobody else . You were right . He 's fallen for me , flat on his face . Now what do you think of that ? " In the realm of Intelligence the first rule was never to underestimateany individual , but as events developed , another rule crept in  --  never to overestimate him , either . Everyone had his weaknesses . The Red Mill was a weakness , and in Intelligence a woman always  --  or almost always  --  made her appearance eventually . That was the reason for the Mata Haris . They were always there for some useful , though seldom proper , purpose . They were the ones who finally caught the best ones out . At any time any man might become a fool about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " he asked . It was dark , and they were whispering , but still she was able to giggle in that annoying way that she used so well as cover . " Am I going home on the first plane out ? " she asked . " Go ahead , " he answered , " and tell me about our boy . " " My boy , " she answered . " And he 's pretty cute in some ways , too  --  wistful . You 're not mad at me , are you ? It was all done in a business way , and you 've been pretty businesslike , yourself . " " I 've had to be , " he said . " I 'm not able to move from one thing to another indefinitely . " She giggled noiselessly again . " That 's why you need a girl along , " she said . " You must be awful in a man 's world , Jack , thinking clearly and cutting down everybody by the numbers . "  | " Go ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Well , he was kind of sweet , " she answered . " You see it was this way . After you left with those people I did n't know exactly what to do . I know you told me to stay right here , but I could n't help being upset , considering . We should n't let our emotions get involved , should we ? " " No , " he said , " we should n't . " " Anyway , " she said , " I felt I had to do something , and so I went downstairs , and outdoors and out to the driveway , and who do you think I saw ? " " All right , " he said . " You got out on the driveway and you saw Big Ben . What was he doing ? " " He had come out of the hotel with one of those big army Val-paks , " she said . " He was putting it in the back of a car . " " It was a dark green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " Naturally . " " They have n't got much of a car pool , have they ? " he said . " But then , they did n't know that we 'd spotted it . Was he in a hurry ? " " No , he was perfectly natural , " she said . " That 's one thing you can say about him . He 's always natural . I did n't think we ought to let him go away like that , so I walked out into the driveway and said hello . " " Was he surprised ? How did he act ? " he asked . " Natural , " she said . " He did n't seem surprised at all . He said , Why , hi , there . Are you out looking for the boy friend ? ' And I said , Yes . A sort of funny thing happened . A Japanese knockedp245on the door awhile ago and asked him to step out for a minute , and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . ' " If he had planned it he could n't have given her better lines . She had said all the right things , and she knew her business . " He laughed , " she went on . " He said , It was only a little joke I played , honey , and I 'm hell on jokes . He 'll be coming back all right . Why , I was just coming up to knock on your door myself , as soon as I 'd stowed this bag . ' " Putting oneself inside Big Ben 's mind , it was barely possible that he had been amused by the collegiate quality of the episode . Big men were more apt to be practical jokers than smaller ones . It was just as serious to overestimate as to underestimate . " I asked him if he honestly meant that he had got you out of the way on purpose , " she said , " and he said , It was just a kind of a gag . But I 'm crazy about you , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , and not one of those do-gooders who talks like a greeting-card salesman . ' How do you like that one , darling ? " " I do n't like it , " he answered , " but it was the way I 've tried to talk . What did you tell him then ? " " What did you expect ? " she asked . " I said I was beginning to like him , too , and I said that you were always so prim and proper , and that I liked people with a real sense of humor . I said I wished he was n't checking out and leaving so soon . I had to say something , did n't I , Jack ? That 's what I 'm here for , is n't it ? " " Yes , " he said , " I guess you 're right about that one , Ruth . " " You see , " she said , " he liked me . In fact , he liked me so much that he forgot one or two things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Yes , " he said . " How much did you play up ? "  | " Oh , not so very much , " she said . " But never mind it , Jack . Only , when he held me in his arms I kept thinking of Bill Gibson , and wondering where you were . It was damned unpleasant , Jack . And if you want to know , I 'm pretty tired of sex tonight . " It helped him only a little to tell himself that of course she had to do what she had done , and that he had to view the whole business as objectively useful . " For just a second I thought he was going to take his bag out of that Chevrolet and stay , " she said . " But he did n't . " " Not even when you asked him ? " he asked her . " Right , " she said , " not even when I asked him . And if I may say so , I sounded awfully good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something that made him know he had to go in a hurry . He kept saying , Gosh , I wish it was n't fixed so that I had to leave here . ' " She gave a perfect imitation of his accent . " Yes , " Jack Rhyce said , " but anyway , he went . " " But not immediately , " she said . " He kept saying , Gee , I 'm crazy about you , honey . ' He seemed to be trying to make up his mind about something . " " All right , " Jack Rhyce said . " And then he made up his mind ? " " Yes , " she said , " he made it up . He said , Honey , this must n't be good-by . Call me as soon as you get to the city . ' Then he wrote down a telephone number and gave it to me . If he was n't there I was to leave my name and he 'd call me back . " After all , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you had . " Good going , " he said . " I can use that number . " " Oh , no , you ca n't , " she said , " because I 've torn it up already . Besides , he 'll know my voice . When you want him , I 'm the onlyp247one who can talk to him , Jack  --  and I guess you want him , do n't you ? " " Yes , " he said , " I 'm going to want him all right . " " Then you 've got to keep me around , " she said , " and now let 's stop being so businesslike , jack . God , I wish we both were on the outside . " They were a long way from the outside , but the desire for escapeand humdrum security formed a tantalizing vision that had an unattainable quality . " I 'm going to talk to you about being on the outside when we get home , " he said . " Let 's talk about it now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a lake like the people in that book who took to the woods . I 'm a pretty good cook , and you could fish or make snowshoes or whatever they do in the woods . " " Yes , " he said , " but we 'd better talk about it sometime later , not now . " " As a matter of fact , you would n't have to do much of anything , " she said . " I have a pretty good income . You 'd be surprised . We could travel and see the pyramids or the Taj , or we could go into the Mau Mau region . " " No , " he said , " I 'd rather buy a farm . " " A dairy farm , " she said . " You could put on white overalls and a jumper every time you milked a cow . " " I can milk a cow , as a matter of fact , " he said . " I wish I could talk you into traveling , " she said . " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to London , and if we did n't have to check in anywhere , and did n't have to be startled when we saw one of those damned familiar faces  --  if we could just be ourselves , having a quiet breakfast and reading the pa/pers , without having to watch for anything , without a single damned compulsion . " " Without having to talk to anyone , " he said . " Without having to find out anything , even the time of day . " " Without having to look over our shoulders once , " she said . " Without a switch-blade in your handbag , dear , " he said ; " without a pill , or anything . " " That reminds me , what happened to my handbag , Jack ? " Her question broke the illusion . They never should have indulgedthemselves with talk about the outside , or with the immaturewishes that such talk engendered . " Moto has it , " he said . " He 'll bring it in the morning . Look . It 's getting light already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after breakfast . " " Going where ? " she asked . " Back to Tokyo , " he said . " Doing what ? " " Doing just what we did before , " he said . " The Friendship League . Mr. Harry Pender , all that sort of thing . " " Are n't you going to tell me anything ? " she asked . " No , " he said . " What you do n't know wo n't hurt you . " " You 've found out something , have n't you ? " she asked . " Never mind , " he said . " What you do n't know wo n't hurt you , Ruth . " " Is it as tough as all that ? " " Never mind , " he said . " I do n't , " she said , " as long as it means you like me . " " That 's the trouble , " he said . " I like you . " " I wo n't be any trouble , Jack , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you wo n't , " he said . " Then let 's talk about the outside some more , " she said . " There are all sorts of things I 'd like to tell you  --  about when I was a girl at school , about parties , about all sorts of things . Jack , it 's time we got to know each other in an outside way . " " I know , " he said . " Later  --  there is n't time right now . " There was never time to think about yourself when you were in the business . Externals kept crowding in , each offering its own insistent problem . He wished to heaven he could keep her out of it , but it was too late now , after what she had told him . You had to move forward . You never could move back , and outside it was daylight , and the first birds were singing . Bill Gibson was dead in Chrysanthemum Rest  --  an overdose of sleeping pills  --  but still the show had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if he had only known what Bill Gibson had been prepared to tell him . Yet even without that knowledge the picture was growing clearer . Time was all that was needed . He wished that he did not have the feeling that time was running out.  |p250J  ACK RHYCE knew a great many stories about the business ; and all of them , when one delved beneath their surfaces , had one thing in common  --  a universal element of simplicity . After all , the framework of an apparatus could not be complex , if only because too many links and convolutions threatened confusion , and Communist techniques ordinarily left their own dreary signatures . Consequently , later , whenever Jack Rhyce reviewed his procedures in Japan he was not surprised to find how little there was about them that was bizarre or even interesting . A series of coincidences had given him a lucky break , although the break had been complicated by the killing . There was also the mistake in identity that had arisen between himself and the Japanese element in the picture , which fortunately had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like any one of dozens of others that kept repeating themselves in various parts of the world . Any trained agent , jack Rhyce knew well , could have achieved the final results that he did . As soon as he had made contact with the Japanese , the lines all began to untangle . It was only the old story of infiltration and cover . As soon as he had spotted Mr. Pender and the Pen Pal room in the Asia Friendship office , most of the rest began to be routine . There was only one unknown element that made him apprehensive , and this lay in Mr. Moto 's remarks about political assassination . The balance ofp251everything in the Orient was precarious . It was his duty to learn more , especially if it would have anti-American repercussions . The Japanese had their own network of agents and , as Mr. Moto had said , they doubtless would turn up facts . However , there was every reason for him to do some thinking of his own . After they returned to the Imperial Hotel on Sunday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less she knew , the better off she was . He told her to sit quietly and to read a good book , but not to leave the room in case he telephoned . He and Mr. Moto left the hotel together in the Buick . He was the foreigner again who needed a guide , and if anyone was listening , they had only heard him ask to be taken to the Mei-ji Museum . They talked while Mr. Moto drove expertly through the traffic . Althoughthe ride was a short one , they were able to say a good deal by the time they had parked the car in front of the conventional European building that housed the pictures illustrating the reign of Japan 's greatest Emperor . The hour was late enough so that the place was closed , but under the circumstances , it was all the better . " I know the guardians , " Mr. Moto said . They will put on the lights , and while I telephone you may enjoy the pictures . I think I can do everything from here very safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the latest news , which was the province of the Japanese , not that of Rhyce , and so Jack walked alone up the great marble staircase to the two great galleries . Granted that the pictures themselves had little individual artistic merit , together they made a panorama that illustrated one of the most dramatic life spans in history . The Emperor Mei-ji had been born and had spent his childhood and youth inp252a feudal Japan , insulated from the world . The Emperor had been a figurehead in those days , under the rule of the great Tokugawa lords . The early scenes of his birth and coronation showed the rituals of a country which had hardly changed since its cultural contacts with the Tang dynasty in China . It was the appearance of the American Navy in the early 185o 's that had finally awakenedthe nation 's latent instinct for survival . There were the pictures of the Emperor arriving in Tokyo to establish his rule in the Tokugawa fortress , scenes of war and of incipient rebellion , and the strangely touching painting of the Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs of the West . There was the Emperor drilling his troops in the Europeanmanner ; there was the war with China , the war with Russia , the European costumes and uniforms , the Europeanized JapaneseNavy , the annexation of Korea ; and finally the crowd at the moat by the black wall of the Tokyo fortress lamenting the Emperor 's death in 1912 . If the current of time had run more swiftly since that year , nothing , not even the atom bomb at Hiroshima , had presented a greater succession of contrast ; for in the Emperor 's lifetime , a nation with smaller resources , more backward and seemingly less adaptable than China , had become a modern state and a world power , and its future was still implicit in the pictures . He must have examined these for more than half an hour before Mr. Moto joined him . " You understand them , do you not ? " Mr Moto said . " They are our Bayeux tapestry . Poor Japan . " He had not thought of comparing the pictures with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their steel helmets and nose protectors , for the battle of Britain , but it was not a bad comparison . Under thep253rule of the Emperor , Japan had gone through many crises as great as Hastings , and the story was not over yet . " Skirov is believed to be here , but can not be traced , " Mr. Moto said . " There is much activity . Large quantities of banners have been made already saying Down with American Imperialism ' and Avenge the People 's Martyr . ' Communists are always so well organized for demonstrations . " In view of what he had seen in other parts of the world , the news was normal and not surprising . The Rosenbergs not so long ago had been the people 's martyrs . " We will have more definite news by tomorrow , I hope , " Mr. Moto said . " Some of our best people are working tonight . I shall be out myself . I should also tell you that they have found the lodging of your Mr. Ben , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him if necessary , " Jack Rhyce said . Mr. Moto shook his head slowly . " It will not be necessary , " he said , " if he is not hiding . " " You can reach me at the hotel tonight , " Jack Rhyce said , and tomorrow at ten-thirty I will be there at the Friendship League , talking to Mr. Pender . " They did not speak as they walked down the marble staircase . After all , the business was routine , and the only question to be answered concerned the reason for the meeting of Skirov and Big Ben . " I 'll drive you to the hotel , " Mr. Moto said . " It will look better . They did not speak again until they were in the Buick , but both of them were thinking . " Is it only your idea , or is it straight information , " Jack Rhyce asked , " that there is going to be a killing ? "  | " There are the signs , " Mr. Moto said . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' They are meant to be out on the streets , Mr. Rhyce . They are not being made for nothing . " He had cultivated a deep respect for Communist agitation . Although the art was as old as revolution itself , Communist disciplinehad streamlined old processes until a mob could now be organized for any purpose as neatly as a billboard artist could paint a picture . " Will it be a large demonstration ? " he asked . Mr. Moto nodded . " Simultaneous outbreaks in different quarters . The street fightersare being given special training . It will be ugly , I am very much afraid , but not on the largest scale . It will be another step forward for Russia . Poor Japan . " " It 's funny , is n't it , " Jack Rhyce said , " to know that riots are being planned , without knowing what 's going to set them off ? " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said . " These people understand my country . " He cleared his throat in a nervous way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers ' uprising in 1936 which cost the lives of so many very nice people in the government ? A very unpleasanttime . Ha-ha . So many of us were so busy . A great deal can be accomplished by assassination . " " Depending on whom you assassinate , " Jack Rhyce said . " Exactly , " Mr. Moto said . " I am afraid they will pick out someone very good . " " From the slogans on the banners , " Jack Rhyce said , " it sounds as though they were going to take out a left-wing Liberal . " " Yes , " Mr. Moto said ; " yes , I think . " " Can you name some prospects ? " Jack Rhyce asked  | " Oh , yes , " Mr. Moto said , " there are several possibilities . Eight , perhaps ten I have considered . I wish so very much your Mr. Gibson were alive . Are you sure you only know him and no one else in his apparatus ? " " I told you once I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust me ? " " Oh , please . " Mr. Moto drew in his breath carefully . " Yes , as much as you trust me , I 'm very much afraid . " " I 'm working with you , " Jack Rhyce said . " As long as we both want the same thing we can keep our cards face-up . " " I am not anti-American , " Mr. Moto said . " I hope so very much that you are not anti-Japanese , Mr. Rhyce . " " Not at the minute , " Jack Rhyce said . " I 'm anti-Communist right now . " Mr. Moto drew in his breath again very carefully . " Americans are so very nice , but sentimental sometimes . May I ask what you intend to do about this Big Ben ? " " It depends on what he 's up to , " Jack Rhyce answered . Mr. Moto cleared his throat and sucked in another breath . " Would you object , " Mr. Moto asked , " if my people were toquestion him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I 'd rather have him followed . He can lead us to what we want just as easily that way as by our going to work on him . " " Ha-ha , " Mr. Moto said . " Americans are always so very sendmentalwhen they are not using flame-throwers and napalm . Ha-ha . Excuse me . If we can not trace him tonight , I am very much afraid we should use Miss Bogart to find him . " " All right , " Jack Rhyce said . " You can use your own judgment . Maybe we should n't leave him loose too long . "  | " Thank you , " Mr. Moto said . " I am so very pleased that you trust me a little , Mr. Rhyce . " " Oh , I do , " Jack Rhyce said , " maybe quite a little . " There was not much more to say . " From now on , " Mr. Moto said , " there will be a car and driver in your name , outside of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . I am so sorry that I am so busy . " " Are you sure you would n't like me to go out with you and help ? " Jack Rhyce asked . " So very sure , " Mr. Moto answered quickly . " You would only be conspicuous , Mr. Rhyce . And please take care of Miss Bogart . She may be so very useful tomorrow . You understand ? " Jack Rhyce nodded . It was easy enough to understand when everything was lapsing into ordinary routine . Emotion had no value in the business . He and Mr. Moto and Big Ben were all expendablepieces on the squares of Intelligence . Jack Rhyce was glad to discover that his momentary desire for vengeance on Big Ben had almost evaporated . As matters had turned out , Big Ben was common property now , and after hearing Mr. Moto speak it was difficult to be under much illusion regarding Big Ben 's future . The net was around him , and a European was too conspicuousin the Orient to hide for very long . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying the price of stupidity . That was the only way Jack could assess Ben 's having given the telephone number to Ruth Bogart . She was sitting quietly in her room when he returned , and the adjoining door was open . " Is everything all right ? " he asked  | " Yes , " she answered . " Everything 's very dull . Have they picked up Big Ben ? " " No , not yet , " he told her . She smiled at him . " Is n't it lucky that I 'm here ? " she said . " Do you want me to try that number ? " " No , " he said , " not yet . " " Then suppose I put on an evening dress and we go out for dinner , " she said . " Only in the hotel , " he answered . " I do n't want us to be buzzingaround too much right now . " He arrived at the Asia Friendship League offices at half-past ten next morning to find that Mr. Harry Pender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aloha shirt . The light from the window glinted cheerfully on his spectacles as he waved a welcoming hand . " Come in , jack , " he said . " Come in . Are you ready to pick my brains ? " " I 'm all set and raring to go , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said , " if you honestly have time to give me some more fill-in on the League picture . " " Why , all the time in the world , Jack , " Mr. Pender said . " Sit down . Have a cigarette ? " " No , thanks . I never use them , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said , and he seated himself in a comfortable , modernistic chair . He was embarrassed that he had not placed Harry Pender untilMr . Moto had explained him , but after all , he had only seen the face in a group photograph , and never in the flesh . Very lit/tle doubt remained with Jack Rhyce now . The man before him was certainly the individual who was known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful list at the office , a former American college instructor who had been holding a Communist card since the late 1930 's , but with no definite recordof activity . He looked older than his photograph as Jack recalledit , and since he had not been heard from , he must have been behind the Curtain for some time . Conceivably he had been one of the Americans in Chinese prison camps who had been mentioned by American war prisoners ; conceivably he had been one of the Europeans who had been mentioned in connection with the germ warfare accusations . It was a pity to be so far away from source material . " It sure is nice to see you safe back from that place , " Harry Pender said . " I see in the Japan Times that one of our fellow countrymen took too many sleeping pills up there . I hope it did n't spoil your fun . " " Oh , there was a little mix-up with the Japanese authorities , " Jack Rhyce said , " but it did n't amount to anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the sights . I sort of wanted to get oriented a little  --  you know , get the feel of the country . " " That 's a very wise thing to do , " Harry Pender said . " A first impression has a lot of value . You know what people say  --  eitherspend ten days or ten years . By the way , where 's our girl friend ? Ruth Bogart , I mean . " " She 's back at the hotel , " Jack Rhyce answered . The question had indicated an unnecessary curiosity . " She was n't feeling so well this morning , a little Japanese stomach , but nothing seri-ous. "  | " Too bad , " Mr. Pender said . " I hope you 've given her something for it . Do you want me to send one of my girls over ? " " Oh , no , " Jack answered . " She 's going to be all right . I just told her to take it easy . Well , let 's get down to business . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how impressedI was with your whole layout here , and all the fine things you 're doing . I want to read up on all the social studies you 're making  --  every one of them . " Harry Pender took off his horn-rimmed spectacles and held them between his thumb and middle finger . " Do n't read too much , Jack , " he said , " or you wo n't see the forest for the trees . " " I know exactly what you mean , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said . " But gosh , I 've got to begin somewhere . Everything ca n't be as smooth sailing as it looks around here , Harry . You must have some pretty big policy problems . " Mr. Pender allowed his glasses to swing like a pendulum between his fingers . He raised his eyebrows inquiringly . " I mean , for instance , " Jack Rhyce said , " problems of personnel . You were mentioning this on Friday , I think . " " Oh , " Harry Pender said , " of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selections , but on the whole , we have a fine team all the way down the line . " " Oh , I never meant to say you did n't , " Jack said quickly . " I was just wondering , well , whether you had any trouble with Communists or anything like that . " He had intended to bring out the subject with fiat-footed innocence , and from the tolerant way Mr. Pender laughed , he was rather sure he had . " Excuse me for laughing , Jack , " Harry Pender said , " but that question of yours is completely characteristic of the point ofp260view that everyone brings here from the States . Rumors become grossly exaggerated . Why , there 's hardly a Communist in Japan , in the sinister sense of the word  --  but you will find varieties of liberals . From my observation , democracy has a permanent footholdin japan . " " Well , it 's mighty nice to hear you say so , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said . " It 's the sort of reaction I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , if there 's a healthy liberal party here . I hope they 're interested in putting social welfare on a sensible scientific basis . " He watched the horn-rimmed spectacles moving in a slow , thoughtful arc , and he was happy to notice that Mr. Pender was giving him his smiling , friendly approval . " You 'll find liberalism here in the best sense of the word , " he said , " and the leaders are highly dedicated people . I want you to get to know some , Jack . I want you to get this Communism bias thoroughly washed out of your hair . " " It 's curious , " jack Rhyce said , " how distance distorts facts . Back in the States we hardly hear about Japanese Progressives , let alone learning their names . Who are some of them , Harry ? " He hoped that his interest appeared fatuously genuine . Mr. Pender 's thoughtful eyes were fixed on him , but he could not detecta glint of suspicion or any diminution in the current rapport between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Pender said , " because the League is just doing a pamphlet on the subject , with thumbnailbiographies of eight or ten of the top-flight liberal politicians . There 's Hata , for instance , and there 's Iwara , and Yamashitaand Nichiwara . I 'll be delighted to show you the copy we 're preparing . "  | " Gosh , Harry , " Jack Rhyce said , " I 'd sure like to see it . Who 's the best of them , would you say ? " " Oh , " Harry Pender said , and as far as Jack Rhyce could see , he was taking the question casually , " every one of them has quite a following , but Hata is head and shoulders above the rest . Noshimura Hata . I 'll see that you meet him sometime . " " Can you arrange it ? " Jack Rhyce asked . " It would be a real pleasure if you could , provided he lives around here . " " He does , as a matter of fact , " Harry Pender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His collection of dwarf trees is very widely known . " " I did n't know liberal intellectuals had large homes and gardens , " Jack said . " Hata is an educated liberal , " Harry Pender answered . The swing of the spectacles in his fingers accelerated slightly . " An Oxford graduate , a member of a wealthy family , and a philan-thropist . " " Oh , " Jack Rhyce said , " then he can speak English , ca n't he ? " Granted that he had picked up the information he had wanted , had the cost been too great ? Perhaps he should not have pursued the subject so long after the name of Noshimura Hata had been mentioned , and yet there had been the danger of dropping the thing too suddenly . His attention was now riveted on the swinging glasses in the right hand of Mr. Pender . There was no doubt that the motion had been accelerated , and there was always betrayal in unconsciousgesture . Instinct was delivering its message to Jack Rhyce , telling him that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended on the next few words . It was time to drop all show of interest , to move on to something else.  | " All you say , " Jack Rhyce said , " goes to prove that preconceivedopinions are always off the beam , are n't they ? I had no idea that the Japanese would be so enthusiastic about sports , for instance . Now , if you 've got the time , I 'd love to hear whether you 're dovetailing a good sports program in with your other projects . " " Sports had a leading priority with us , " Harry Pender answered . " Nothing pulls people together so much as meeting on a playing field . In fact , I should put sports ahead of any other culturalinterchange when it comes to the promotion of good will . . . " At least they were away from liberalism , and embarked on a sea of verbiage which , to keep the cover right , ought to demand most of the morning for a crossing . It was necessary to sit there for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief would say , a do-gooder in every sense of the word . Talkingwith Harry Pender was both real and unreal . It was ironic to think that they were each talking only for the other 's benefit . Did Mr. Pender believe he was impressing him ? And did his own artificial guilelessness seem real to Mr. Pender ? He only knew that they both were artists , each concealing any impatience or boredom he may have felt while they discussed the Asia FriendshipLeague . It was quarter of twelve when he ventured to push back his chair . " Harry , " he said , " it 's been swell of you to give me so much of your time . I have as many ideas packed in my mind as I have reading matter in my briefcase now . I guess I 'd better take the rest of the day just sitting in the hotel room boning up on the material . "  | " It 's been a good morning for me , too , Jack , " Mr. Pender answered . " How about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than five minutes away from here is the best beef sukiyaki restaurant in the world . " Jack Rhyce picked up his briefcase and endeavored to straighten out the wrinkles in his seersucker coat . " There 's nothing I 'd like better , Harry . And please give me a raincheck on that offer , " he said . " But right now I 'd honestly better go back to the hotel and see how Ruth is . How would lunch tomorrow be , instead ? Because I 'll be right back here tomorrowmorning , making a nuisance of myself with another batch of questions . " She was in her room , reading Terry 's Japanese Empire . She looked up inquiringly when he came in . " Has anything happened here ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " One thing . Big Ben telephoned . " He tried to forget about her as a person , when she told that news . Nothing must interfere with the business , and she must have felt the same way , from the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " He wanted to make a date for five this afternoon , " she said . " I told him I was n't sure that I could get away . I said I 'd call back at three . " " That 's my girl , " Jack Rhyce said . " I think the time has come to pick him up , Ruth . It 's a good thing you 're along , all right . " " Thank you , sir , " she answered . " How did you get on with Pender ? " " I wish I knew , " he said . " He worries me a little . He 's in the  |p264business  all right . I think I 'd better see the Japs again , right off . I 'll be back in about an hour . " " Are n't you going to cut me in on anything ? " she asked . " Only about Big Ben , " he said . " Do n't ask for any more . " " I wo n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful . Do n't be too sure of yourself . " Frankly , he wished he felt more assured . He had not been under the hotel porte-cochere for half a minutebefore the car and the driver that Mr. Moto had indicated the day before appeared . The meeting place was the back room of a curio shop . Mr. Moto , still in his blue suit , sat at a table with a telephone in front of him , drinking a cup of tea . " No more news than yesterday , " he said . " So sorry . " " I 'm sorry , too , " Jack answered . " And how is Mr. Pender ? Did you see him ? " Mr. Moto asked . Jack Rhyce nodded . " You were right about him , " he said . " We have his photograph , but he looks ten years older . He knows a lot about liberal politicians . I 've been doing some thinkingthis morning . " " I am so glad to hear it , " Mr. Moto said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . " " We do n't seem to know what 's going to happen , do we ? " Jack Rhyce said . " You only know that they 're making plans for an organized demonstration , and you guess that there 's going to be a political killing . We had the same word in Washington . But it 's only a guess , is n't it ? " " That is true , " Mr. Moto said . " Our people are working , but they have come on nothing new . " " Then I think we 'd better pick up Big Ben , " Jack Rhyce said . " I 'm sorry . I hate to break up an apparatus . "  |p265Mr  . Moto nodded . " No one has seen him , " he said . " He is hiding very carefully . " It was time to tell the news , and time to lay the lines . " Not so carefully , " he said . " I think maybe we 're overrating our boy . He called up Miss Bogart this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon . She said she was n't sure that she could do it . She 'll call him back at three . " Mr. Moto stared at the teacup , and his forehead wrinkled and he shook his head . " I do not like it , " he said . " It does not sound correct . " " Meaning it does n't sound like the first team ? " Jack said . Mr. Moto 's gold teeth flashed when he answered . " I am so glad you use the expression , " he said . " I wish that Miss Bogart would give us the telephone number . We could have traced it by this time . " " I told you she would n't , " Jack Rhyce said , " and I decided not to put further pressure on her . The fact is she may be highly useful in picking up Big Ben , and she was sent over here to be useful . She 'll call him any time we want . " " She does not want to leave you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rhyce , but I do not like it . I do not like it . " " I agree , " Jack Rhyce said . " A lot of angles in this situation worry me . You can trace the number when she calls him . We may need it if anything goes wrong , but I do n't believe much in tracing numbers . " " May I ask why ? " Mr. Moto asked . " Because it 's too obvious , " Jack Rhyce said . " They always use a public telephone in some public place  --  a bar or a railroad station . "  | " If we knew the telephone , " Mr. Moto said , " we could be watching and take him when he makes the call . " " Yes , " Jack Rhyce said , " but I do n't think our chances would be good . He 's a professional  --  he would be on the lookout for strangers . We 're safer to let Miss Bogart call him . It 's better not to be too busy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . Then he nodded slowly . " I think I am inclined to agree with you , Mr. Rhyce , " Mr. Moto said . " I realize that Miss Bogart is a very intelligent girl who has had training in handling these matters . I shall call on you at the hotel at a quarter before three . " " And I 'll go along with you later , " Jack Rhyce said . " Trace the call , then , if you want , but let 's catch him where he 's waiting for Miss Bogart . It will be safer and surer that way . And I want to be along when you pick him up  --  just out of interest , Mr. Moto. "  |p267JACK  RHYCE had played a part in several similar actions in America and Europe , the details of which seldom varied . Find your man and keep him at a given spot . Get the group distributed . Have the car ready . Close in simultaneously from all sides . This was the one maneuver that required expert co-ordination and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple of a struggle . Often pedestrians ten feet away did not noticethe group around the victim , trussed and pinioned in the approved style , being half pushed , half carried to the waiting car . Even if things did not move quite as planned , a well-placed blow at the back of the skull could solve the difficulty . Big Ben was a big man , but he could be handled , given the proper group . Jack Rhyce was certain that there would be no trouble if he were in the party . " Oh , " Mr. Moto said , " you do not trust us , Mr. Rhyce ? You will think differently , I am sure , when you see my people . Poor men . They are not well paid , but they are as neat as your FBI . " The obviousness of the operation was a sufficient explanation as to why Mr. Moto did not like it , since the use of a woman to lure a man was among the most shopworn in the sordid bag of tricks which everyone knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that worked the most frequently of them all . Jack only had to remind himself that he too had fallen in love with Ruth Bogart freely to accept the motives of Big Ben . The re/pugnance that he felt at having to use her in this venerable trick only convinced him further of Big Ben 's infatuation and besides , he had seen them on the dance floor . By the time he and Mr. Moto reached the hotel , the preliminarypreparations were all in hand : the equipment immediately necessary was packed in Mr. Moto 's briefcase . When Ruth Bogart saw the briefcase she smiled a thin , Mona Lisa smile . Jack had never seen her looking prettier . The excitement and the exactingdemands which would be made of her in the next few minuteshad added to the delicacy of her features and the luster of her hair . Even her voice had a new seductive quality . " So you boys need me , do you ? " she said . " All right , rig up the telephone . " When Mr. Moto took out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with approval . There were right and wrong procedures in wire tapping , and Mr. Moto knew all the proper ones . " I suggest that we both listen , Mr. Rhyce , " he said , as he handed Jack Rhyce a pair of earphones of Japanese manufacture . The Japanese were able to make anything . " Are you sure this wo n't be too big a load ? " jack Rhyce asked . " Do n't be silly , Jack , " Ruth Bogart said . " He knows his stuff . " She smiled her brightest smile . " I could n't have set this up better myself , and now it is three o'clock , I think . Perhaps  --  if you are ready  --  I 'd better make the call ? " " No , " Jack Rhyce said . " Let him wonder . Let him sweat it out for ten minutes . " He never forgot that interval of waiting , or how happy Ruth Bogart looked.  | " Jack , " she said , " you 're glad I 'm along now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered , " at the moment , Ruth . " " It 's nice to know I 'm useful , under the proper circumstances , " she said . " Maybe that 's all any woman wants . " They did not speak for another minute or two , and then Mr. Moto broke the silence . " Excuse the question , " Mr. Moto said . " Do you carry a blackjackwith you , Mr. Rhyce ? " " Funny you should ask that , " Jack Rhyce answered , " because I was thinking of it myself . No , I have n't one with me . " Mr. Moto reached inside his briefcase . " If you will permit , it will be a pleasure to present you with this one , " he said . " It may be useful , and ha-ha , it will be easier for you to reach him , if needed . " Jack balanced the instrument expertly in his hand before he slipped it into his back pocket . " Thanks , " he said . " I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm sure , " Mr. Moto said . " So very sure you will be . And now perhaps Miss Bogart should make the call . Let us not have the gentleman too discouraged . " They sat silent while Ruth Bogart gave the number , and there followed , of course , a moment of suspense until they heard the answering voice . The connection was very clear . There was no doubt in the world that it was Big Ben . " Gosh , honey , " he said , and his voice was plaintive , " I 've been settin ' here . I mighty near thought it was a brush-off . " " Oh , Ben , " she said , " I 'm sorry , but I could n't call until I was alone . " " You mean he 's back with you ? " Big Ben asked . " Why ,  |p270honey  , I kind of got the idea he might have left you for good back there in the mountains . When did he come back ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogart answered . " He just said he went out with some Japanese friends and drank some saki . " " And he 's hanging around you now , is he ? " " Ben , do n't be that way , " she said . " I told you I was tired of him , and he 's gone now . " " Well , do n't forget you 're my girl now , honey . How about say around six tonight ? " She first glanced questioningly at Mr. Moto . " Why that would be lovely , Ben , " she then said . " Will you call for me here at the hotel ? " There was a silence on the other end of the wire . " Why , honey , " he said , " I had some trouble there , last time I was in Tokyo , and the folks there maybe do n't like me too much . How about going down to the Ginza and meeting me outside the Cimaroon beer hall ? It 's a GI place , honey , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting by the front entrance , come six o'clock . " " But , Ben dear , I do n't know this town . " " I 'm going to see personally that you 're going to know it and love it before you 're through , honey , " he said . " It 's no trouble to get there . Just you tell the hotel doorman . Any taxi driver can take you to the Cimaroon . " " Well , then you be right outside , " she said . " It 's spooky alone in a place where you do n't know the language or anything . Are you sure you 'll be there , Ben dear ? " " Sure as hell is n't freezing . Just you do n't worry . Take a cab , " he said.  | " All right , " she said , " but it makes me a little frightened , Ben . " " Aw , now , " he said , " there 's nothing to be scared of , honey . Wear something cute and fluffy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget  --  the Cimaroon . You got it , honey ? " They all had it  --  the Cimaroon  --  and the conversation was over , and they each sat for a moment in a questioning sort of silence . " How did I do ? " she asked rack had been analyzing every pause and change of tone in the speeches . A voice over the telephone without features or personalitiesto support it was a disembodied thing . Although he had no doubt that the voice belonged to Big Ben , there was a doubt as to whether it had been wholly credulous . In the end , everyone speaking on the telephone always assumed a new and peculiar personality . Even Ruth Bogart 's voice had exhibited strain , and the same had been true with Big Ben , but there had been so little deviation that he could safely attribute it to the medium of communication . " You did fine , I think , " he said . " Do n't you think so , Moto ? " Mr. Moto was dismantling the wire-tapping device . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on the whole he gave me the impression that he wanted so very greatly to see Miss Bogart . " Mr. Moto snapped his briefcase shut . " The Cimaroon is a beer hall and night club , frequented by American soldiers and sailors , a suitable place for him to select , " he said . " It should not be difficult to take him very quickly if he is waiting on the sidewalk . I must be leaving now to make arrangements . The car and driver will be waiting to take youp272there , Mr. Rhyce . May I ask you to arrive in front of the Cimaroonat half-past five ? " " Let 's make it 5:15 , if it 's all the same with you , " Jack said . " Those Joes have second thoughts , and get careful and early sometimes . Once I had to do a snatch in Paris  --  one of the first I ever was mixed with  --  but never mind it now . " " Thank you , " Mr. Moto said . " I quite agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth Bogart asked . " Am I going with you , or not ? " " Certainly not , " Jack Rhyce said quickly . " There wo n't be any need , Ruth . " " If he does n't see me , he may not show , " she said . " I 've known it to happen , Jack . " As things stood then it seemed safe to discount that possibility . Jack was actually experiencing a feeling which was almost one of peace . As far as he could see , the Japan assignment was drawing to a close . If the ending was not wholly satisfactory , it was effective , and with the way things were going , they could not beat about the bush forever . His main mission had been Big Ben . He took the blackjack from his hip pocket , tossed it in the air and caught it , with the same carelessness he would have caught a baseball on the outside . It was very nicely constructed . The Japanese were always good at detail . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You 'll only be in the way if there 's any kind of hassle . He 's a big boy , and he may muss things up . " " I think Mr. Rhyce is correct , " Mr. Moto said . " I am most grateful to you , Miss Bogart , and it would be so nice if I could pay you my respects when this is over . Perhaps a Japanese suppertonight ; but  --  ha-ha  --  not at the Cimaroon , and just withp273me and Mr. Rhyce . But  --  ha-ha  --  not with Mr. Ben . At 5:15 , then , Mr. Rhyce , and thank you very much . " The feeling that everything was over still persisted after Mr. Moto had gone . It resembled the easing of tensions he had experienced before when a job was almost finished , and everything was in the groove . But this time elation was added to his relief , which he tried to check because he always distrusted elation . Finally his conscience troubled him with a nagging suspicion that he was ending things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might to an ultimate conclusion . It was true that he was hedging his bets , but it was better to hedge than lose , and they were winning enough . At least they were crippling the apparatusby taking out Big Ben . " You know , I feel pretty good on the whole , " he said to her . " When we get him , we can move the hell out of here and head for home . " Her expression had brightened , too . " It ca n't be soon enough for me , " she said . " And why ca n't we start being ourselves when we get on that plane ? " " I do n't see why we ca n't from there on in , " he answered . " What do you mean ? " she asked . " From there on in ? " " A lot of things , " he said , " and we ought to be able to startdiscussing them as soon as I get back here . " " Do you mean you still love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do , " he said , " and a lot of other things . Come to think of it , I would n't have missed any of this . " " Even being unprofessional ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said , " even being unprofessional . " " Jack , " she said , " what 's going to happen to him ? " " He 's not our problem , " he said . " The Japs will take him over.  |p274But  it 's the best we could do under the circumstances , Ruth . " He turned and strode across the room and back . " We might have gone further into this if Bill Gibson had n't died , but I think it 's time now to stop this show . I really do . " " It 's sticky , letting the Japs take him , " she said . " I wish you and I were n't in it . " " We 're in it all right , " he said . " You 're too nice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , too . " " I would n't be surprised , " he told her , " but let 's put our minds on pulling out of here tomorrow , Ruth . " The interval before his departure for the Cimaroon always remained in his memory as a domestic sort of scene . " I do n't suppose we 'd better inquire about plane reservations yet , " he said . " No reason for anyone to know that we 're checkingout , but if you want something to do while I 'm out you might start packing your suitcases . There might be space on something tomorrow . " " Jack , " she said , " do n't you think you ought to wear somethingheavier and darker than that seersucker coat ? " " Oh , I do n't think so , " he answered . " This wo n't be night work , and it 's awfully hot outside . " " I wish you were carrying a gun , " she said , " just in case . Would n't you like to borrow my fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to need it . " " I can do fine with this jack , " he said . He was feeling almost jovial now that everything was set . " I 'm really pretty good at controlling one of these . " " I think you ought not to wear crepe-soled shoes , " she said . " You might slip in them . I do n't know whether you ever knew Bobby Burke , who used to work in Paris . He slipped making ap275swing at Oscar Ertz  --  you know , the Czech  --  just outside the Gare du Nord . He skidded on the pavement and had a shiv in him before he could recover . " " These shoes are skid-proof , " he told her . " No , I never did know Bob , but I 've heard plenty about him . Ought I to be jealous ? " " Darling , " she said , " I never knew about you , dear , and you never knew about me . You wo n't ever need to be jealous . Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome . " " So do you , " he said . It was time to be going , but he did not want to leave her . " Jack , " she said , " if you do hit him , follow through . Let him have it all . He 's an awfully big man , you know . Now you 'd betterkiss me good-by . I do n't want you to be late . " " Do n't forget Moto 's coming to take us out to dinner when we get back , " he said . " I wish we were going alone . We have n't had much fun here , what with one thing and another . " " Oh , " she said , " there 'll be lots of other times . Take care , Jack , please take care . " He remembered those last words most distinctly . In fact , they echoed in his memory all the way out of the hotel . He had a final glimpse of her before he closed the door . She was standing smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The taste of the American GI was responsible for most of the innovations along the Ginza , and it was worth remembering that they reflected the immaturities of youth  --  naturally enough , since the age average was low in the American armed forces . Thus it was not wholly fair to be overcritical of the garishbeer halls and night clubs , as full of gay plastic color
