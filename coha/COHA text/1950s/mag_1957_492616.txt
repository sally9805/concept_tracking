BELAFONTE Gives it All He 's Got By Jeanne Van llobnes Afew years ago , in a Madison Avenue office , a veteran booking agent frowned through his cigar smoke at the handsome young Negro waiting eagerly on the other side of the desk . " I 'll give it to you straight , Harry , " the agent said . " You have n't got a prayer of getting anywhere . Number One , to go into folk singing would be committing professional suicide . Number Two , it just ai n't as easy to get bookings for Negroes . And Number Three . how come you 're so damned dedicated you wo n't even slant these folk songs of yours to some special audience  --  men , women , teenagers or the old-timers ? Come off it . boy . Who do you think is going to listen to you  --  the folk ? ' Evidently , there are plenty of " foil " in the United States , for today Harry Bebiome gets a warm welcome in every entertainment fieldand his earnings have come close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums of folk songs arc steadily among the top ten national hest-sellers . He gives folk-music concerts in Southern as well as Northern universities , and he ranks with Ezio Pinza in drawing the biggest crowds in the thirty-nine-year history of Lewisohn Stadium Concerts . Pinza attracted 27,000 in 195L Five years later , Belafonte drew an audience of 25 , ( 100 , and thousands more had to be turned away because of reduced seating capacity . He was costarred in the Broadway show , 3 for Tonight , with Marge loci Cower Champion , in the film Carmen Junes with Dorothy Dandridge , and has a dramatic lead in the film Island in the Sun . He was the first Negro entertainer to appear at the Empire Room of Chicago 's Palmer House , the first male Negro to appear at New York 's Waldorf-Astoria . Now he regularly opens the seasons of the Waldorf 's Empire Room and Starlight Roof . Thirty-year-old Belafonte is the most popular folk singer ever heard in America . There arc several theories making the rounds to account for his success . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to say , he 's a marvelous male animal ! " Bing Crosby told me , " Harry 13clafonte is a great , great artist , I think . His scope in our business should be illimitable . " The Broadway critics , perhaps a little unnerved by his way of " singing as if his life hung in the balance , " have tagged him as " incandescent " and " irrepressible . " Harry himself put it this way : " I 'd say it has taken me almost all my thirty years to be an ' overnight success . ' " Usually dressed in black slacks and bright shirt , Harry always comes on stage in a hurry . He 's tall and slim , with clear-cut features and gold-brown skin . As the spotlights narrow and a guitar strikes a chord , he starts singing  --  about workingmen and religion , and love , pain , fun and longing . In song he tells you the story of the fox that went out on the town one . night , of a thirsty man working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jubilant prophet foretelling the end of Negro woes on That Great Gettin ' - Up Mornin ' ; he sings about a lonesome pioneer or a lumberjack who daydreams the death of his mean-hearted boss . When he slides into rollicking calypso songs like Hold ' Em Joe . the story of a mischievous donkey , or Matilda , a connivin ' wench who made elf with his money , he coaxes listeners to join in on the chorus . And , strangely , sometimes the sternest members of the audience are the first to find themselves singing . Blessed with absolute pitch , Harry can pick up and sing folk songs entirely by ear . He has had no formal musical background , no singing lessons , and he does n't read a note of music . Technically his voice is second tenor . " But do n't let that mislead vou . " Harry told me . " I 've been called everything from an illegitimate tenor to a make-believe baritone . And there arc people who hate it no matter how I sound . When I was getting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about the operation and said , ' Yeah ? Say , that 's swell ! Now maybe he can sing ! ' " Actually , it 's not primarily vocal quality that Belafonte is seeking to get across to his audiences . " What I want to communicate , " he says , " is the honest emotion of , for instance , some little guy in Haiti when he sings forth his harvest prayer of thanksgiving . " Though Relafonte was born in New York City , his family is West Indian , and the West Indian influence has been strong in both his life and his folk songs . His mother was a Jamaican , his father a Martinique seaman . His paternal grandfather , a white French farmer , went to the West Indies and married a Haitian ; his maternal grandfather , of African descent , married a white woman from England . Harry is half-white and half-Negro , but he considers himself a Negro . When he was a year and a half old , he was taken to the West Indies . He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he went to sea with his father on a Caribbean fruit boat . Then he was sent to a Jamaican boarding school . Class distinctions on the island were rigid , and the schoolboys were forbidden to mingle with any of the " lower folks . " But in tempting contrast to the boarding school , which Harry remembers as an austere place , was the warm and friendly atmosphere among these lower folks , down on the sand barges and up in the hill country . They made light of trouble and sang all the time , whether they were working or just idling . Ile was lonely , too , so he kept running off to be with them , even though he got whipped for it . " Those class distinctions , " Harry told me , " seemed to me a peculiar set of values , Then , at thirteen , I came back to New York City and ran smack into racial discrimination . This was not only violently painful but something I could not reason out . It sort of shut me up inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and either silent or very outspoken  --  when somebody suggests that Ile cater to a " special " group . He means to reach everybody , with no line drawn classwise , raccwisc , agewise or otherwise . " But that booking agent was right , " he says . " This goes against the rules . For big success , you 're supposed to decide whether you want to be a matinee-idol type and play to women , a tough-guy type and play to the men , or a Liberace type and play to the mothers . " Alost of Belafonte 's time these days is spent on his work . When he is at " home , " usually a hotel suite in New York , he 's constantly on the phone ; musicians arc tuning up for the daily work session , and everybody  --  ranging from an RCA Victor executive to the little boy down the hall who wants to show Harry his new fire engine  --  has to see him right now . Ordinarily Harry is full of soft-speaking charm and laughter . When he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners arc forced to pay attention , whether or riot they know what he 's tal k i nga bout . But at times Harry is moody , and once in a while he blows up at someone he really likes . Fortunately , he 'll realize then that it 's time for him to shake loose from work pressure  --  to go eat a big steakand-mashed.or sit in on thedrumsat a jazz club , or take a solitary walk through the streets of Harlem . With his closest coworkers he has arranged to have a periodic " hell session , " entirely private , in which they can blow on ' steam and fully understand one another . Harry was recently divorced from his attractive wife , Marguerite , after a separation of over a year , but they work together with remarkable co-operation in bringing up their two little girls , Adrienne , seven years old , and Shari , two The children live with their mother in her Long Island home . Summers and weekends they arc often with their father , Belafonte considers himself as much story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit I understand , " he says . " And because to me they are so much truth , I have gone beyond the pure minstrel style , the straight verse and straight melodic line , in order to communicate the great dramatic strength in them . The urgency I feel in all my work comes from the things that happened to me as a person at the American Negro Theater . Because , man , that was the biggest turning point in my life ! " At that time , 1946 , Harry was working in a Harlem apartment house , firing furnaces and overhauling the plumbing . After eighteen months in the Navy , where he had served as a storekeeper , he was just slogging along by himself , not even iwondcring what he was going to do with his life . But one night some actor members of the ( Continued from Page 69 ) American Negro Theater who lived in the apartment house gave him a ticket for the closing performance of an A.N.T . play . After the show , Harry went backstage to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute . At three o'clock in the morning he was still there , helping tear down scenery . " I liked the atmosphere , " Harry says , " the group feeling . Everybody wanted this theater to work , num ; they were all pitching in to help . And it kinds rubbed off on me . " He went back the next night to help out , and before long he was taking courses given by the American Negro Theater in scenic design , lighting and stage managing . He was also a permanent , but unpaid , member of their technical production crew . Then one night when the group was casting a new play , called On Striver 's Row , they needed a " type " for a certain role , and they told Harry he was it . " Damned if I know yet what they meant , " he says . " I still do n't know what ' type ' I am . But they asked me would 1 take this role ? Now , there 's nobody that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand them . I liked being backstage inhaling dust , burning my hands on ropes , handling hot bulbs and all that . But when they asked me to act . 1 said no , no , no , you wo n't get me into that ; I 'm not an exhibitionist ; I 'm not genin ' up on nobody 's stage and show myself off . They said O.K. Then they began to give me the ' group muscle  --  to make mc feel that I was letting the whole organization down in their moment of need . And by the time they got through giving me the workovcr , boy , I was in the play ! " That play 's short run could have been the start and finish of Harry Belafonte 's career , but while studying the next play , Sean O'Casey 's Juno and the Paycock , Harry got completely absorbed in the character of young Johnny Boyle , Irish insurrectionist . He went after the part and got it . " And when I stepped out onstage , 1 knew that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to do  --  I wanted to be an actor and communicate to large masses of people . Here was a chance for mc to communicate like I 'd never communicated before in my . life . My life had always been such a solitary one , you know . I 'd never had any childhood friends or guys I bummed around with . But now this was going to be my destiny , and my way to be with people . However , I was to find out it 's not so easy for a man who 's gut brown skin to walk in the stage door of the theater . " Utilizing the G.I. Bill , Harry studied acting at the Dramatic Workshop in New York with guys and girls now so well known as Marion Brando , Tony Curtis and Elaine Stritch . But when Harry started going around to the casting offices , he faced a quick reply : " If we ever put on The Hasty Heart , you could play the part of Blossom . " The Negro character Blossom had only two words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as an actor , he took a **25;680;TOOLONG job in New York 's garment district . Then his friend Monte Kay . a young producer at a new Jai/ spot called The Royal Roost , suggested that he try singing popular songs . " I like the way you sound , " Kay told him " I know it is n't your pure theater , but at least it 's show business . And that AGVA i American Guild of Variety Artists ) minimum is a hundred and ten dollars a week . " So one rainy night early in 1949 Harry got dressed in a new blue suit and went out for his first audition before paying customers at The Royal Roost . " As my accompaniment , " he recalls , " I had these masters of jazz like Charlie Parker and Max Roach ; and there I was , a young punk standing up stiff as a board . I had to clear my throat about ninety times before I even knew what key 1 was in . In spite of all my dramatic training . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And my mouth was so dry that . honest to God , when I smiled I had to reach up and pull my upper lip loose ! But the audience turned out le be quite receptive , even quite warm , and to this day I really do n't know why . " Belafonte sang at The Royal Roost for twenty-two weeks ; then for two years he played night clubs around the country as a pop singer . " And I was a mess , " Hurry says . " I stood still , with my hands folded over my abdomen , so to speak , I sang to the Ladies  --  one mushy lose song after another . I could n't get worked up osur any of it except how unreal the lyrics arm ! l 'd sing my four or five little pop dillies , take my little bow and run off backstage and  --  ha ! ? look in the mirror and ask who Was I kidding . My most notable achievement was that I cut my first record of the first song I ever wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So one night at Martha Raye 's Five o'clock ' Club on Miami Beach I gave it all up , the seven hundred and fifty a week included , And I guess pop singing , in turn , willingly gave me up . The field is terribly overcrowded now , what with Ellis Presley and estry body ! " After he quit pop singing in 1951 , Bela-Ionic did not quite drop from sight  --  he wound up frying hamburgers in the window of a Greenwich Village restaurant . He says he was happier there than he 'd been in a long time . He was fed to the teeth with some of the false values of show business he 'd seen , He was back among the working people he understood ; he was playing basketball at the " Y " again . And he was listening to his old collection of folk records . especially those of the late Huddle Ledbetter ? " Lead Belly " ? a Southern Negro folk singer whose work made a lasting impression on Harry . Lead Belly was a folk singer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gangs . Harry worked up his own constructions of these folk songs . Through library books he traced the lives and events which had inspired the songs , and when he sniffed the drama there , he got excited . A folk singer , he thought , could have us vital a story to tell as any actor . After a tryout at the resort town of Lake Mahopac , New York , he was ready for " the big town . " But New York was not interested in Harry Belafonte. folk singer . He kept pestering  --  and got his friends to pester  --  Max Gordon , owner of the Village Vanguard , for cscn a one-night stand . Re portedly . Gordon shrugged his shoulders , spread his hands and said , " I heard him as a pop singer , and he 's nothin ' . So what am 1 supposed to do with him ? " But finally Gordon let Harry sing at the Vanguard . A fourteen-week engagement followed , and Belafonte had his toehold . Hurry had been folk-singing for only four months when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . signed him with RCA Victor . But it was the late John Murray Anderson , lust luminary of the grandiose era of Ziegfeld and Earl Carroll . who gave Mat-mite his first chance to set foot on a Broadway stage . In 1953 he had Belafonte sing three songs in Almanac , the last revue he produced before he died . Harry regularly stopped the show . He won the Antoinette Perry , Show Business and Donaldson awards for being the best supporting actor in a musical . He left Almanac before the end of its run to go to Hollywood for the movie seniors of Carmen Jones . Later he returned to Broadway to appear in 3 for Tonight . Belafonte 's first long-play-record album , Mark Twain , was released in 1954 . With his second and third albums , Bela-ionic and Calypso , in 1956 , he hit the really big money in record sales . He leads the pack in this country 's current trend to calypso music  --  in fact , Variety , the show-business newspaper , reports that he has in large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc approaching the one million mark . In his rise to riches , Belafonte feels that occasionally he has been taken for a sucker financially , and that he has been false-Identical . Consequently , his approach to friendship now is based on a misture of instinct and CaUlIOUS appraisal of the person 's integrity , As to what he has done with all his money , he replies , " Beyond the big bite for taxes and the drain for salaries and espens . I wish I knew where some of it went . And , believe me , in this business you got ta look long and deep to find a heart that 's not attached to your fame and fortune . " Harry and his auditors are investigating the eatent of his assets , and with a great deal of care he is working out a new long-range investment program . A year ago Ham ' would sign tabs %kith only a second 's glance at the total , and add a generous tip ; today he still adds the generous tip , but he stops Conversation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few : camera equipment , Italian shoes and rewarding trips to places like South America , the Pacific islands and Mexico , where he can get to know the people and their music- Sometimes he is considered unsocial because he steers clear of the usual celebrity rankslazile . " That whole routine of hurrying from one his party to another and being seen in line restaurants just does n't tempt mc , " he told me last year , after my husband and I took him on a trip into the fEserglad in search of folk-song material . " I 'd a hat rather go out plowing through those Florida swamps with you and your husband ; you know. , where you come back looking like who 'd ' a ' thought it and smelling like Man . " Harry 's No . I guitar accompanist , Millard Thomas . who acts as Harry 's no-man , has been a good friend since " ' Userican Negro Theater days . Guitarist Frantz Casseus , a white-haired Haitian , joined them recently . According to public notion , a folk singer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " But I ca n't play the guitar , " Harry captains , " and Millard ca n't sing . And Frantz. who can play concert guitar , sings even worse than Millard . " Esen though Harry can now draw down S I 0,000 fora single concert he never coasts through a performance . When he sings work songs , for instance , he emphasizes intrinsic sounds  --  a grunt , a curse or a shout . " I 'S c had opera singers come up 75 to mc , " Harry says with a laugh , " just to ask how I can ' Muth ! ' and ' ungh ! ' and attack my vocal cords the way I do . They claim it would ruin them if they ever did it . ' ' People send folk songs to Belafonte from odd corners of the world . But sometimes when he ca n't unearth anywhere an authentic folk song to express a certain slice of life . Harry &setups; one of his own , often collaborating with the young dramatist Bill Attaway , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as his well-known " there was agitation in the town because 1 was appearing with a while company , They did n't get so riled about Millard ; with his ' Viler skin , it was often hard for them to be sure he was a Negro . After the show , police whisked us out the stage door into a car , and in a private plane we were flown out to North Carolina . Experiences far more painful occurred all through the tour , but after that sudden plane ride , the University of North Caroline was like an oasis ; the people were very cordial . " BelatIonte is glad he toured the South because he believes that during each performance there was a communication with these white audiences , but he still feels keenly the fact that there were no warm overtures , nothing by way of saying hello to him as a person , from the white persons in the cities in which he appeared . Least year , my husband and I invited Harry to have dinner with us at our home in Coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was Feted by some Southerners as a ' celebrity , ' but when I walked into your house , it was the first time I had teen invited into a white home in the South and treated warmly just as a person. ** As a singer , Warmth : has often taken on too heavy a schedule  --  chain engagements , and esen multiple jobs such as singing two shows a night at the Town and Country night club in Brooklyn , New York , while rehearsing hours on end for the road show Sing , Man , Sing . Finally the schedule brought on chronic laryngitis , and last lune he had to have a siousa nil-vocal-cord operation . When he emerged from the hospital he was conenlightening to him than open hearings . He said that the administration 's version of what had happened in our dealings with Britain and France about the Middle East differed so widely from the sersions of British and French spokesmen and of the Democratic Party that it might take a long time to bring out the essential facts . And that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate is concerned . The Senate has asked the State Department to make ti full-scale review of American insolsements in the Middle East since 1946 . That ought to keep the department 's historical section busy for many months . After the review is completed , Senator Fulbright said he hopes for joint closed hearings of the Foreign Relations and Armed Forces Committees similar to those held in 1951 by the same committees after President Truman dismissed Gen. Douglas MacArthur . That might take many more weeks or es en months . So an official explanation of the Great Middle East Al ystcry has been indefinitely postponed . Congressional investigators have not yet agreed upon an answer to that ' wading question : " Why did British and French leaders deliberately . mislead President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles about their decision to attack Egypt ? " However , so long as that question is in doubt , Americans will continue to be confused about our relations with Britain and France , and about our new responsibilities in the Middle East . Art interim report therefore seems to be in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eisenhower Administration 's own account of the Great Middle East Mystery . It is based upon private conversations with a number of the foremost American policy makers , including Secretary Dulles and his principal asfronted with a persistent rumor , which got under his sensitise skin , that he was now through as a singer . So he was a little edgy when Ile filled his date at Los Angeles ' open-air Greek Theater . With fervent performances he set a new two-week-attendance record , and established himself alongside Victor Borge and Beatrice Lillie as a master of the one-man show . " Two hours and thirteen minutes every night of doing everything I wanted to do ! " Harry exulted . " As long as I live I shall never forget the tribute those people gave me . " Harry now plans to cut out all his night-club singing , eseept for an annual engagement at the Waldorf . He intends to devote his time to folk-music concerts , especially in universities , " Belafonte 's powers of concentration and deep feelings of truth in expressing himself make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Mann , the director of such films as The Rose Tattoo , I 'll Cry Tomorrow and Teahouse of the August Moon . " Now that Belafonte has opportunity in film and theater , there will be growth , in his powers and scope . And with his tremendous emotional capacity he has the kind of talent that can make him a major artist . " Evidently the saga of Harry Belafonte is just getting under way . But there is one thing that you can be sure of : he really means what he say s when he comes out singing : sistants who are concerned with Middle Eastern affairs . The opinions expressed here are entirely my own , but the facts acre confirmed by senior Foreign Sers'iCe officers whom I hare known for decades . Their scrsion of events has clarified in my mind developments in the Middle East which previously had been obscure . For one thing , it explains why the administration was so optimistic about the Egyptian crisis shortly before the Anglo-French attack , and why the Eisenhower Doctrine became an urgent necessity after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not properly a doctrine , although it probably will bear that label forever now , What Mr. Eisenhower really asked Congress to do was to acknowledge that the American people have suddenly been stuck with major responsibility for another huge section of the earth . What Congress told the world , in effect , when it reluctantly backed up the President , was this : " Yes , the Middle East is our baby now , even if we have n't yet figured out just how it got left on our doorstep . " As Senator Fulbright pointed out , the administration 's account of Middle East events differs sharply ' from those presented by British and French spokesmen . In one sense this is a crime story . The principal crime was not the Anglo-French attack on Egypt , which followed years of provocation . The principal crime was the Anglo-French concealment of their Egyptian gamble from their chief ally , the United States . During the thirty-three years in which I have been reporting international politics , I can not recall any parallel for this strange deception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
