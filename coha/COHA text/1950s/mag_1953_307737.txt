After almost ten years of parliamentary life , Georges Bidault , courageous and resourceful leader of the French resistance movement in World War II , no longer looks like a man who would rush carelessly into danger-particularly not into the perils of a general election . Knowing that the next Premier will have the power to bring about the Assembly 's dissolution any time in the coming 18 months-in the event that an absolute majority of the Assembly should disapprove of his government-France 's seat-hugging Deputies were favorably disposed towards Bidault , President Auriol 's third Premier-designate in three weeks . After the action-demanding appeals of Reynaud and Mends-France . Bidault seemed like a tired juggler , but one who would not miss a throw . <P> Poised , with the juggler 's air of bored concentration , Bidault spun the political plates in the air , and deftly caught them : <P> Indo-China : " To hasten the end of the war by all means at our disposal , " but not " a retreat that would be incompatible with . . . our dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of France and Frenchmen , " then " to lead the Tunisian and Moroccan peoples to the point where they can manage their own affairs . " <P> The European Defense Community : commitment , but " after settlement of the Saar question " and " negotiations with Britain . " <P> The national economy : " Living unquestionably above our means , we are slowly wending our way towards decadence , " but no increased taxation , for " the amount of effort demanded of taxpayers is near the maximum . " <P> Government spending : certainly a cut in public expenses , but only after a " systematic investigation of all services , all nationalized establishments . . . aiming at fusions . . . redistribution of functions . " <P> To handle these situations , Bidault asked the Assembly to delegate some of its powers to him , so that the necessary measures could be carried out by decree . <P> The Short Vote . The Assembly members , connoisseurs in the art of balance , were impressed . When it came to the vote , Bidault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number required to make him Premier . This too was an example of balance . The short vote had been carefully calculated by the Radical Socialist Party , whose candidate , Mends-France , Bidault had voted against . The Radicals split their votes and altered or withdrew them as the balloting went on , so that Bidault would almost , but not quite , make it .
