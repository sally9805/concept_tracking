I Knock at the Door proves a thoroughly engaging reading version of the first volume of Sean O'Casey 's full-flavored autobiography . In an arrangement by Paul Shyre , six people seated in front of lecterns recount a late Victorian Dublin childhood that ends when a twelve-year-old boy has " learned poetry and . . . kissed a girl . " The boy was not just any Dublin child-beyond the gifted writer he would some day be , he was threatened with blindness ; and in a shabby and fiercely Protestant home was watching his father die . <P> The boy 's already hard-beset mother was caught between the doctor 's strict orders that the child be kept out of doors and the rector 's badgering insistence that he go to school , Sunday school and church . The climax of childhood comes with Sean being caned at school and rebelliously striking back . <P> But there is humor too-often right in the midst of misfortune , as in what might be called " Coming Home from the Funeral . " And there is small-boy adventure , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacconist 's for " an ounce of Cavendish cut-plug . " O'Casey everywhere respects the dignity of childhood as a full existence in itself , as he recaptures a boy 's hazy sense that a world offered by Victorian grownups as square is , all the same round . <P> If here and there on the stage the story loses a certain inward glow , it gains in outward color from snatches of song or the interplay of street voices . With the performers-particularly George Brenlin as Sean and Aline MacMahon as the mother-providing a resonant voice box , I Knock at the Door wisely puts adroit storytelling ahead of theatrical effect . If four walls and a passion can make a good play , almost as much can be had from six chairs and a prose style ; and an ounce of Cavendish cut-plug can be worth a pound of routine theatrics.
