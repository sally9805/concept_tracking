The models were shown to members of Congress , newsmen and others during a cere-1 mony opened by Air Secretary Harold E. Talbott . The plans ; for the academy , said , were approved by himself , his staff and three consultants , Pietro Balluschi of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Eero Saarinen of Detroit . and Welton Becket of Los Angeles . The ultra-modern buildings will be constructed of metal , stone and glass on the rolling foothills of the Continental Divide seven miles north of this Western resort city . Unlike its historic brethren at West Point and Annapolis , the academy construction truly represents the modern air age in architectural concept . About 17,500 acres of mesas and valleys , dominated on the west by the rampart range of the Rocky Mountains , comprise the site . To the north stands Cathedral Rock , a reddish giant landmark .

The superintendent 's residence also overlooks the area that will include the base hospital , everyday athletic facilities and parade grounds . The architects , Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill , likened the dominant position of the chapel to that of the ancient abbey of Mont-Saint-Michel in France .

A dormitory area will house single airmen assigned as academy support personnel .
