txt The staff of the Joint Congressional Economic Committee predicted a $2 billion Federal surplus for the current fiscal year ending June 30 . Such a - surplus would be 10 times the Administration 's forecast of $200 million . A Treasury spokesman termed the new prediction premature . " All we can say is that we do n't know , " he declared . " We do n't have any figures yet on which to revise our January estimates . and we wo n't have until the middle of May " Despite the prospect of a bigger-than-anticipated budget surplus , the Joint Economic Committee staff renewed earlier recommendations against any Federal tax cuts at this time . The Treasury spokesman avoided the tax relief issue . saying it depended on the final surplus figure . " We wo n't start thinking about lower taxes until we know what we have to work with . " he declared New Estimate The committee staff based its fiscal optimism , in part , on a new estimate by the President 's Council of Economic Advisers that gross national pioduct  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $399 billion during the fu at quarter . The first quarter estimate is a $1 7 billion gain in the annual rate from the fourth quarter of last ' ear The fiist quarter rate tops th , . ! opening three months of 1955 by a whopping $23.7 billion In analyzing the latest " economic indica- tors " report by the President 's advisers , the Congressional staff forecast a $3 billion climb in Federal revenues over President Eisenhower 's estimate in his January budget message Spending , the staff figured , would probably be about $1 billion higher . The Administration 's fiscal 1956 budget looked toward a $200 million surplus on June 30 , stimating revenues at $64.5 billion and spending at $64.3 billion . After March corporate tax payments were in . Treasury Secretary Humphicy told a Congressional commit . tee that both revenues and spending this year could be expected to rise $1 billion each above the January estimates . Later Receipts Awaited However , a Treasury spokesman claimed Mr. Humphrey 's later figures were based on " trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision of the January estimates , the spokesman insisted . He said individual income tax receipts , which wo n't be tabulated until mid-May , would tell the lea story . Even then . he added , corporate tax receipts in June would have to be taken into account The Joint Committee staff also claimed the surplus for the fiscal year beginning next July 1 would be larger than the $400 million estimated by the Administration in January . But the staff made no specific estimate of how big the surplus would be The report did note , however , that next year 's surplus could shrink if business conditions deteriorate or new legislation increases spending " significantly more " than estimated President Eisenhowei 's budget message last January recommended that the current year 's budget surplus be used to make a " modest " payment on the public debt rather than for tax relief MI Humph ' el. , in discussing the budget at that time conceded the predicted $400 million surplus might be " conservative " but said it was an honest figure based on the best estimates available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a slim surplus would leave no room for tax relief during this session of Congress . However . Mr. Humphrey left the door open for tax . reduction if the January estimate was too conservative and the June 30 surplus was " substantial . " The Treasury Secretary defined " substantial " as something in the neighborhood of $2 billion to $4 billion . But the Joint Economic Committee staff argued that even with a $2 billion surplus this year , a tax cut would be unwise " in the face of a booming economy already pressing the limit of immediate resources and fanned by a variety of upward drafts . " Inflationary Forces The committee staff took special note of the Federal Reserve Board 's restrictive monetary policy aimed at suppressing inflationary forces in the economy . " Sonic of the present inflationary forces do not appear to be sus. tamable , and if not now restrained . give prospect of creating maladjustments. " the staff commented . " The recent i ises in industrial prices , stock market prices , inventory accumulation . and bank credit expansion are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the staff , argue against any tax cut now and also " reinforce the view that overall restrictive governmental policy continues to he warranted " " It is clear that the cost of a monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to maintain stability in the face of a tax cut now would be too great a risk . " the staff report asserted . " When inflationary forces slacken . a policy of progressive credit ease can be . and should be . initiated , with changes in fiscal policy reserved until more presistent depressing forces arc apparent "
