Some Christians and skeptics alike believe that sects which soften the old-fashioned hell are running a considerable risk . Fear of the eternal fire , they hold , helps to make people behave . Last week the powerful United Church of Canada , a union of Canada 's Methodists , Congregationalists and some Presbyterians , seemed willing to take this chance . Its Committee on Christian Faith published a booklet , Life and Death , that repudiates the fire and brimstone of the traditionalists ' Hell . <P> " In popular language Hell is the place of dreadful punishment . . . Is this how we should think of Hell ? " Not at all , says Life and Death . The Bible uses the word Hell to translate the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades , which were underworld places where all the dead lived shadowy , unsubstantial , joyless lives ; at least at first , Sheol or Hades was not considered a place of punishment or torment . Gradually , the idea developed that there was a difference between the life of the righteous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the wicked dwelt was called Gehenna , and the part where the righteous dwelt was called Paradise . Often translated " Hell " in the New Testament , Gehenna is really derived from the Valley of Hinnom , outside the city of Jerusalem , which was notorious as the place where fires burned to consume refuse and as the scene of ancient child sacrifice . <P> Gradually , the idea of flames became associated with the life of the wicked in their part of Sheol . Jesus , says Life and Death , used this as a figure of speech in the parable of Dives and Lazarus , and he was not threatening his hearers with fearful torment so much as reminding them that life is set within a divine order in which man reaps the harvest of his deeds . " We have no right , " says the committee , " on the basis of this parable , to go further than this and interpret Hell as the place of everlasting fiery torment . " <P> Echoing other theologians , the committee argues that a less primitive kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the next world if not in this , may be necessary if sinners are to be brought to a realization of what their rebellion has meant to God in the rejection of his love and the frustration of his purpose . Sin involves separation from God . . . We have said that to be in Heaven is to be with God and with his redeemed . Hell is to be without God and without the fellowship of those who love him and rejoice in his presence . The farther we get away from God , the farther we get away from our fellows and from all that is good and true and beautiful . Hell is the state of infinite loneliness , desperate deprivation and final frustration . "
