Seventeen Storeys Down A Story by Faith McNulty Drawings by Dorothy Cole Ruddick 10:45 on a bright , cold Tuesday morn-T ing Margaret Robinson , twenty-seven- year-old housewife , took the sterilizer containing the bottles and paraphernalia for her baby 's formula off the stove in the kitchen of her apartment on East 72nd Street in New York City . She placed the sterilizer on the kitchen table to cool and put a pot of water over the gas flame . She thought of making the bed during the few minutes before the water boiled , but instead lit a cigarette and walked to the window in the dinette just off the kitchen . Timmy , the dachshund , followed her and jumped up on the low window seat . Together they looked down on the street , seventeen storeys below . " Too cold to take Johnny out , " she thought . " People are holding their hats and bending against the wind ... bits of paper flying around . I must get Johnny a better cap .. . one that wo n't slip over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it with her eyes closed and yet she often stood and gazed out the window , as she was doing now .. To the left she looked across the black tar rooftops of tenements for half a mile or so till her eye came to a high brick building , a new hospital . Be-hind it rose the towers of the Queensb6ro bridge and beyond that she could glimpse the roofs of low buildings on the other side of the river in Queens . Directly opposite her , on the other side of 72nd Street , was a high apartment building like her own , blocking her view , but to the right was another clear stretch of low roofs ending in apartments somewhere in the sixties . One of them had a roof garden with a tree , a real tree , growing on top of it . Looking down she could see the sidewalk , the liquor store , the movie house , the canopy of the apartment building opposite , the flower shop , the laundry . A Department of Sanitation truck was parked by the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck while clouds of ash swirled like smoke over their heads . Timmy was looking down at the street . Now he whined and rubbed his nose on the windowpane . He hated Department of Sanitation men and at this height he was at his most courageous . Margaret rubbed his neck affectionately . The windows of the dinette and of the adjoining living room were wide and high and , because the apartment was on the top floor , they caught the sun for more than half the day . The long , distant view gave Margaret a feeling of isolation from the life of the city below , like living in an eagle 's nest , she sometimes thought . She had come to love the days of sunny solitude with Johnny and Timmy , days in which she worked easily and productively while they waited for Mat to come home . Standing at the window Margaret felt again the satisfaction in her home for which she was so grateful . Something , perhaps it was the tree growing so weirdly on the skyline , made her think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny there next summer . She longed to see him sitting on clean grass , his fat little body bare and brown in the sun . Would he be too small for the beach , she wondered . No , he 'd be a year in August and he could crawl in the sand . Mat would love taking him to the beach . Johnny made a talking sound in his room at the back of the apartment . It reminded her of the pot on the stove , the formula to be finished , and his lunch to be made . She walked back to the kitchen . Timmy followed , his nails clicking on the linoleum . Margaret looked at her watch . It was 10:52 . She was pouring canned milk into a graduate of boiled water , counting the ounces , when she first heard the siren . T HE sound was a wailing , up-and-down sound like a fire engine . Her first thought was not alarm , but puzzlement . Were they testing the signals today ? She had n't seen any notice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgently . She finished pouring the milk and stood still for a moment listening . Margaret felt a tremor of fear , not real fear , but the fear which springs from the imagination , the sort of fear one feels at a movie thriller . " How horrible , " she thought , " someday to be standing here like this and hear that sound and know it 's the real thing . " She walked quickly to the window and pushed open the casement . The high , thrilling siren scream rushed in at her . It came from everywhere and filled the sky . She looked down and saw that people in the street ? below had stopped walking and were looking up at the sky . A man 's hat blew off and he did n't turn to look after it . Then a man started to run . He dashed into the entrance of the apartment building . A car stopped abruptly and two people ran into the laundry leaving the car doors open behind them . Suddenly everyone on the street was running . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sound was added as a police car came shrieking through . The policemen were leaning out and waving their arms , motioning drivers to pull up at the curb . Margaret turned from the window and ran through the kitchen to the baby 's room . Timmy started to bark and ran beside her yapping , his feet drumming on the polished floor . Johnny lay on his back in his crib , his cotton night dress rumpled up under his arms . He smiled and waved his arms when he saw her . Margaret snatched him up and held him . " Oh God , he 's soaking wet , " she thought . She stood beside the crib with the baby in her arms and realized she did n't know what to do next . In here , with the windows closed , the siren was fainter , but she could still hear it ; mechanical , disembodied , terrifying . The room seemed peaceful , still . The bathinette with neatly piled diapers underneath , Johnny 's blue sleeping bag folded on a chair , a doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresser , all were calm and reassuring . The voice of the siren was sinking and as she listened the sound diminished to a sort of sobbing and trailed off to a silence . Margaret thought : " This could be a raid . It 's possible . If it is , we have eight minutes . Eight minutes before they get here . " She looked at the window and the blank , white sky beyond . In her mind 's eye she saw a tiny gpeck in the sky , a tiny speck somewhere in the stratosphere , growing bigger and bigger , bearing down relentlessly , rushing at her . She pictured the glass shattering and the wails of the room flying apart and the floor disappearing beneath her . She clutched the baby 's warm , damp body . " We 've got to get out of here , " she said . She ran to the hallway and pressed the elevator button and stood there with the baby heavy in her arms . She thought of Mat . Where was Mat ? Was he at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the bomb fell and New York was half a ruin , streets blocked , buildings tumbled down , how would they find each other again ? Where was her sister ? Was she in that rickety apartment or out someplace where she could get into a good , solid basement ? The elevator shaft was silent , the green doors blank and impenetrable . Timmy sniffed at the crack between them . Margaret felt the dampness of the baby against her arm and realized suddenly that he was wearing only his cotton nightgown . Suppose she had to go out on the street . He 'd freeze to death . She had no coat . She had on high heels . They 'd make it difficult to walk any distance . She ran back to the baby 's room and grabbed two blankets from his bed . Then she thought of Johnny 's food . Suppose she could n't get back to the apartment . In a few hours he would be screaming with hunger . She ran to the kitchen , Timmy clicking along behind her . She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her right began pouring the formula into the bottles . The elevator rattled and she heard the doors clanking open . She recognized the voice of old William , the elevator man . " Mrs. Robinson ! " he shouted , ' Mrs. Robinson ! Air Raid ! Come quick ! " " I 'm coming , " she shouted back and fumbled with the nipple and cap for the bottle . It was impossible to screw the cap on with one hand and she bent down and put the baby on the floor . His head banged as she released him . His eyes widened in surprise and then he began to howl . " Mrs. Robinson ! I ca n't wait ! " William screamed . His voice was almost breaking . " It 's orders . I ca n't wait ! " " I 'm coming , " she shouted and bent to pick up Johnny . As she straightened up she heard the doors clang shut and the whir of the descending elevator . I N HER arms Johnny stopped crying . Silence filled the apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through them she saw again the blank , white sky and a sob of panic rose in her throat . She caught Johnny around the middle with her right arm and with her left hand grasped the blankets and a bottle . She turned to the kitchen door and , half-balancing Johnny on her hip , managed to open it . The stairway was silent too . She saw steep iron stairs leading down , lighted at the landing by a high window of frosted glass that shed a cold , dusty light on the olive-green paint of the stair well . Margaret started down the stairs . " How long to go down seventeen flights , " she thought . " Five or six minutes . But even halfway down it will be safer than up here . " Halfway down the first flight she heard the telephone ringing in her apartment . She slowed her step and almost came to a halt . Mat ? A picture of Mat rose in her mind . It was so vivid he was almost tangible . She wanted intensely to hear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were pleading with her to speak to him . She reached the landing , stopped , and looked up . The ringing stopped . She realized her vision was blurred and tears were running down her face . She started down the next flight . She found it very difficult to go down with any speed . Her arms were too burdened to hold the rail and her high heels scraped on the stairs . At the next landing she paused and kicked off her shoes before going on . In her stocking feet she was surer-footed , but the corrugations of the stair treads bit into the soles of her feet . Her descending steps began to take on a rhythm and she found herself growing a little calmer . How much time had passed , she wondered , since the siren sounded . Seven minutes ? Eight minutes ? Surely more than that . If it was coming it should be here now . Or any second . She looked at the high , blank window on the landing below her and pictured it shivering into glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching the window , the glass would come straight at her . And Johnny . If it came as she turned past the window she would get it in the back . But if it came just bore she turned the corner to go down the next flight she would be protected . At the next corner , as she turned her back to the window , her shoulders hunched a little and her back prickled with fear . She went on . With the jolting of her steps Johnny was slipping down on her hip and she had to keep hitching him up . Her right armached from his weight . At the next landing she glimpsed a number on an apartment door . Twelve . She had gone five flights . The thought of Timmy came to her . He was n't with her . ' She must have shut him in when she bolted from the kitchen . She felt a wave of pity and guilt . Dear Timmy . She pictured him in the empty apartment running from door to door , sniffing at the cracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdens were slipping and the ache in her arms made her stop . She shifted Johnny to her left shoulder , draped the blankets over her right and held the bottle in her right hand against Johnny 's hack . She started again and with her left arm free to hold the rail the going was easier . Approaching the eighth floor she heard a metallic , mumbling voice below and as she reached the landing realized it came from a radio inside the apartment . She heard the words " . . . an attack on New York City . A general alert was sounded at ten . . . . " The voice became a mumble as she left it behind and she could n't get the rest of the sentence . Seven . Six . Five . She was doing well . The tears were dry on her face . Her heart pounded steadily with exertion , but the tightness of panic was leaving her . She became aware of a drumming sound in the stairwell below her . A moment later she realized it was the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to reach the people below . Four . Three . Two . My God , I 'm almost down , she thought . And it has n't happened yet . Nothing has happened . By now she could hear voices below . Relief came over her . I 'm a fool , she thought , a panicky fool . I almost went to pieces . She was at the Innom of the stairs . They ended in a small landing and a heavy green door . A man was holding the door open . She could see a mass of people in the lobby beyond and hear a clatter of voices . At the last step she felt her legs giving away and she sat down suddenly on the stairs . The man holding the door glanced at her and smiled . She recognized him dimly as a tenant with whom she had occasionally shared the elevator . " Have a long trip ? " he asked . Margaret nodded . " Seventeen , " she said . . ? ? ? ? ? ark : " Quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles were vibrating with the release of strain . She shifted Johnny to her lap and put the bottle of milk on the step beside her . Her hands were shaking too . " You 'll have a Charley horse tomorrow , " the man said . He seemed perfectly composed and suddenly Margaret felt safe . " What 's happening ? " she asked . The man shrugged . " Nobody knows , " he said . " Maybe something 's coming . Maybe not this time . Radio said it was the real thing . That 's all anybody knows . Good practice anyway . " He paused . " Say , would you mind moving into the lobby ? I 'm not supposed to let people gather on the stairs . " Margaret nodded and gathered up Johnny and the bottle and the blankets . She got to her feet painfully and unsteadily and walked through the door into the lobby . It was jammed with people . Everybody she had ever seen in the apartment building was there and many who looked strange to her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman sitting on a bench against the wall rose when she saw the baby in her arms and motioned her to sit down . Margaret sat down . She was too tired to look around . She just held Johnny and sat . A few minutes later she heard the clatter of voices around her grow louder and the pitch higher . She lifted her head and faintly heard the sound of a siren . It grew louder , the note high and steady . " All Clear ! " voices called , " All Clear ! " Margaret half rose . She started to laugh and then sank back on the bench . T HERE was the bustle of movement in the crowded lobby . People were surging past her into the elevator . The doors clanged and the machinery whirred . The siren still sounded its steady triumphant note . A moment later the elevator returned , the doors opened and a voice cried " No rush now . Take it easy . Women and children first . " Someone grasped her arm . She got up and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator rose . As it passed the first floor she realized with relief that it was going straight to the top . She was jammed against the wall behind the operator . She recognized William 's narrow head and sparse grey hair . The memory of his slamming the doors , calling out , " I ca n't wait , Mrs. Robinson , " filled her with sudden resentment . In front of her she recognized Mrs. Randall , the woman with four boys . The children were pressed against the gate , all holding onto each other , as close as sheep in a fold . The elevator reached the top and the doors opened . She shoved through onto her landing and opened the door into her apartment . Timmy leaped at her , wriggling and barking . Margaret stood at the entrance to the living room and looked around her with a sense of amazement as if she had been away on a long trip . Everything was as it had been , serene and unchanged . The newspapers on the table , the pillows rumpled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar , all hers , the only home she had ' , and all of it unsubstantial , fragile , as precarious as a swallows ' nest clinging to a crevice in a cliff . It came to Margaret , as she stood there , that never would this , her home , feel safe to her again .
