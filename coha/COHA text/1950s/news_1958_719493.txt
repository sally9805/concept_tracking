txt HAVANA , Feb. 2 ? " A month ' from today all Cuba will be in I flames . " ' The speaker was Luis Perez ' Rios , youthful leader of the underground labor wing of the rebel forces of Fidel Castro . He was interviewed near Havana . Luis Perez Rios is , of course , a nom de guerre  --  his identity remains secret . Senor Perez revealed that at a meeting of rebel leaders Jan. 21 to Jan. 27 it was decided to concentrate on industrial sabotage . " We are changing our tactics , " he said . " We had been doing sporadic bombings in the cities as well as burning sugar cane fields and tobacco drying sheds in the countryside . This will continue . " But now we will center attention on the disruption of industry , " Senor Perez continued . " We will cripple sugar mills , tobacco factories , public utilities , railroads and refineries . " Our first action under the new plan was the fire last week at the Esso refinery . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esso . just happened to be hand // iest from a tactical standpoint . " ' The fire , which started Jan. 27 , destroyed a gasoline storage tank at Belot , across the bay from Havana . Newspapers . in. the capital estimated the loss at $100,000 to $150,000 . " We are entering a decisive period , " the young rebel went on to say . " We must do everything possible to prevent the national election June 1 . We can not accept this election . " Why not ? Because everyone knows the electoral process is a farces and that Dictator Batista will continue to hold power . " The Constitution bars President Fulgencio Batista from seeking re-election to a second consecutive term . He would have to wait eight years  --  two terms  --  and run again in 1966 . But Batista is expected to hand-pick the Presidential candidate of the Government coalition . Moreover , a special law recently adopted permits the retiring President to assume supreme command of the Cuban military forces . Thus the rebels see scant hope of getting rid of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy is to disrupt the relatively settled and prosperous national economy in the hope this will impel the passive elements of the populace to join the uprising . The sabotage campaign would culminate in a general strike . By adopting this plan Sefior Castro , who runs the rebellion from its stronghold in the Sierra ' Maestra of Oriente Province , is taking a calculated risk . He believes Cuban resentment over destruction of property and the loss of lobs will turn not against him but against President ' Batista . There Is a further danger . United States business has an $825,000,000 investment in Cuba . Widespread destruction of American property might change the State Department 's attitude toward Senor Castro from one of apparent neutrality to outright hostility . Senor Perez told this correspondent the sabotage campaign would not spare United States property . How the Esso sabotage was accomplished is " a military secret , " Senor Perez said . Reviewing the results of rebel sabotage of the sugar crop , Senor Perez said the burning of cane fields inflicted $42,000,000 damage . United States sources here insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They say only 50,000 to 60,000 tons of sugar cane has been destroyed and that ? the-rebels would have to burn a million tons before there was any appreciable effect on the Cuban economy . Senor Perez said unusually heavy January rains had hurt the campaign . Now his men will go after the sugar mills , he declared . There are 161 sugar mills in Cuba , of which thirtythree are American-owned , according to the United States Embassy . The rebel leader asserted that the burning of tobacco sheds in Pinar del Rio , which produces the best cigar tobacco , had been " very successful . " In Pinar del Rio last week this correspondent was told by Armando Aguilar , wealthy tobacco grower , that about 400 sheds had been burned , but that the loss was minor compared , with the recent devastation by , wind , rain and blue fungus . Senor Perez was eager to dis-1 pel the notion , which he be- , Ilieved was widely held in the ' United States , that the 26th of ' July movement headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that although Cuban labor leaders were " on Batista 's payroll , " the labor rank and file sympathized with Senor Castro .
