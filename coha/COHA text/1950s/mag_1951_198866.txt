MANNERS &; MORALS <P> For most of his 46 years , Franchot Tone , a well-bred man and an able actor , pursued happiness , usually in the form of blondes . Last week , pursuit of a blonde landed him in a Los Angeles hospital with a brain concussion , a broken nose , and a fractured cheekbone . Against doctor 's orders , the blonde climbed a fire escape , spent two hours with Tone , then announced that she would stick by him . From what newspaper readers had learned of the blonde during the preceding 24 hours , this would seem to be a fate somewhat worse than a brain concussion and a broken nose . <P> Barrel of Monkeys . The blonde 's name was Barbara Payton , 25 , who has been playing around Hollywood for three years in &; out of grade-B pictures . Her latest is called The Bride of the Gorilla . What she mainly does is to run , scantily clad , through jungles while an ape-man pursues her . It also came natural for her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go to be seen cooing with each other . During a court battle with his exwife , another blonde named Jean Wallace , Tone was asked about Barbara . " How many times have you seen her naked ? " asked his wife 's lawyer . " I could n't estimate , " answered Tone , " but I would say frequently . " Hollywood columnists chattered happily about a marriage as soon as Barbara divorced her husband , an automobile salesman back in Iowa . <P> Those happy days were eight long weeks ago , before Barbara got a second look at Actor Tom Neal , a 37-year-old cowboy actor and onetime amateur boxer . The first look had been disappointing . " Last year , Tom and I have a date . " Barbara explained a few weeks ago . " and he 's playing it real nothing , you know ? I think to myself : What have we here , dear ? From then on , I avoid him . " <P> The trouble with the first date was that Tom had his clothes on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him at the Sunset Plaza swimming hole . He 's in a pair of bathing trunks . Honey , I just take one look at him and positively flip . " She sighed . " More fun than a barrel of monkeys . " <P> Six days &; nights later . Tone was out and Neal was in . Neal spent the next month and a half lolling around Barbara 's patio doing nip-ups with bar bells while Barbara gazed adoringly . The gallant Neal later told friends : " Barbara asked me to marry her . It was n't the other way round . She said she was in love with me . " <P> Franchot Tone , however , is no man to step aside for an actor who plays supporting roles to range ponies . A triangle was in the making . Though most such triangles tend to be lopsided , this one was isosceles , the two men apparently equal in Barbara 's heart . Isosceles love triangles can be static or dynamic . This was dynamic . Barbara made up her mind differently every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells the story : " We all met at a party and it was Franchot again with her . " A few nights later , Neal said he got a phone call at 3 a.m . " Look . Tom , " groaned Barbara , " I ca n't take it with this <P> Tone . I want to go back with you , you 're so exciting . " Next day , she called again : " This Tone is too dull . I ca n't go this route , see ? " Neal decided to wait a little while .
