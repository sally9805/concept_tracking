Marching into New Delhi 's presidential mansion last week to present his credentials as the new U.S. Ambassador to India , scholarly-looking Ellsworth Bunker was momentarily jolted by a loud , off-key blast from a brace of turbaned trumpeters . Next morning when he opened his paper the ambassador was greeted with yet another sour note : a slashing attack on the U.S. and Britain by India 's Prime Minister Nehru . <P> Electioneering in the industrial city of Kanpur , Nehru explained the British and American U.N . vote to condemn India 's seizure of Kashmir ( TIME , Feb. 4 ) as simply a reward to Pakistan for its membership in SEATO and the Baghdad Pact . The intent , said Nehru , was " to make India change her independent policy . " Then , amidst wild cheers , he cried defiantly : " India will not change her stand on Kashmir one iota under any threat . " <P> As evidence of the lengths to which India is prepared to go to keep Kashmir , Indian Puppet Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed and his followers last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kashmir legislature three weeks before a single vote could be cast . ( The new legislators , explained the pro-Indian state election committee , had either been unopposed or opposed only by citizens whose nomination papers unfortunately proved invalid . ) <P> The anti-Western mood that Nehru was whipping up in India last week had all but undone any good that came out of the Eisenhower-Nehru meeting . British High Commissioner Malcolm MacDonald reported to London that Britain 's standing in India is at a dangerously " low level . " In fact , not all Indians apparently recognize at what point they are to check their criticism of Britain and the U.S. The Economic Review , official organ of Nehru 's Congress Party , published two inflammatory editorials . The first suggested that the foreign policy of the Eisenhower Administration reflects the prevalence of juvenile delinquency in the U.S. The second , dealing with Queen Elizabeth 's recent tour of Portugal , commented : " Elizabeth II is sorry that the world is not able to appreciate the hanging by the neck of Greek patriots in Cyprus or the butcheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of intelligence . " <P> In the U.S. the Economic Review 's remarks whitened not one hair . But in Britain , which still resents the fact that Nehru raised more outcry over Suez than over Hungary , remarks about the Queen simply Will not do . NEHRU INSULT TO QUEEN , headlined the London Daily Mail . Hastily , Nehru condemned the article as " wholly intemperate . " Said he : " I am greatly disturbed that the Queen 's name should have been brought into this , and I should like to offer my apologies to her . "
