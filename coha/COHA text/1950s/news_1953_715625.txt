txt SHORT CREEK , Ariz. , July 26 ? Arizona authorities , under an 11n - usual proclamation of insurrection , iied this remote farming hamlet the state 's northern border at dawn today and placed virtually , the entire adult population under arrest in an effort to wipe out the nation 's last remaining center of organized polygamy .. The defendants , thirty-six men and eighty-six women , constituted the principal membership of a professed Fundamentalist sect ? disowned by the Church of Jesus , Christ of Latter Day Saints ( Mor-I mon ) in 1939 ? that has continued to practice the plural marriage re-I nounced by the Mormon church in 1890 . Separated from the outside world by the towering cliffs and arid gorges of Arizona 's wild and inaccessible " Strip " between the Grand Canyon and the Utah border , members of the cult , organized on a communal economic basis , allegedly have been maintaining as many as a half-dozen wives and thirty children , and have fostered child marriages . In addition to 122 adults and child brides named in warrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony included 2ome 263 children . The state 's avowed objective is to wipe out the community , im-1 prison the adult ringleaders , and ' find new homes and lives for the children and for the numerous // women who , it is suspected , were forced into the cult 's bizarre system against their will . Gov . Howard Pyle. in a radio report to the people of 4. rizona this morning , described the colony as " a. lawless commercial undertaking " dominated by half a dozen " greedy and licentious men " who used religion as a screen for systematic " white slavery " and economic exploitation . The community , he said , was " unalterably dedicated to the wicked theory that every maturing girl child ( usually before she reached the age of fifteen ) should be forced into multiple wifehood with men of all ages for the sole purpose of producing more children to become more chattels of this totally lawless enterprise . " Organized in the Nineteen Thirties under the name of " United Effort , " the cultists pooled their , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life from a community warehouse . Their principal pursuit &; are raising grains and cattle and operating a sawmill . Raiders Were Awaited Despite elaborate secrecy precautions during protracted preparations for the raid , word of the plans had reached the community . The raiding party , which had half expected resistance or flight by the inhabitants , found most of the community assembled at 4 A. M. Pacific daylight time on the grassy school yard , where they had raised the American flag in the middle of the night and waited for the raiders . In the faint light of a moon approaching a total eclipse , the cultists joined in singing " America " as the raiding convoy of more than fifty cars rolled in over the dusty one-lane dirt road leading to U. S. Highway 89 , forty miles to the east . " We 've run for the last time ? we 're going to shed our blood right here , " said one of their leaders to the raiders , alluding to previous brushes with the law . However , there was no violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and identification of the defendants , the cultists stood or sat quietly in small groups in the school yard , talking among themselves and with the reporters who had accompanied the raiding party . Reply to Charges They looked like average farm folk , but their expressions were sober and intense . Many of the boys wore garments obviously fashioned from the uniforms of some of the twenty-odd members of the community who had served in the armed forces in World War II and since . One boy , in an Army uniform , said he had just returned from Korea . Familiar from long experience with the accusations against them , the Short Creek people offered what amounted to rebuttals to Governor Pyle 's speech before it had been delivered . They said they were true " Joseph Smith Mormons , " adhering to polygamy ; that the Mormon Church had had no right under its own precepts to renounce the practice ; and that the current interference with it was a violation of their constitutional right to religious freedom . Emphatically contradicting the accusations of licentiousness against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly cited the contrast they said existed between the " prostitution and harlotry " of the outside world and the decorous serenity of their own way of life . Deny Forced Marriages They denied that girls were ever forced into marriages . Only five residents of Short Creek were not involved in the polygamist cult , Governor Pyle announced in his talk  --  Jonreed Lauritzen , novelist , and his wife ; Deputy Sheriff Alfonso Nyborg and his wife , and Don Covington , Short Creek 's only bachelor  --  all descendants of settlers who preceded the " United Effort " members . The Governor said they had given " invaluable help " to authorities in arranging the action against the community . With roadblocks at both ends of the mountain-bordered town , officers marshaled the men defendants for initial appearances in an improvised Magistrate 's Court set up in the one-story school house , and presided over by Superior Judge J. Smyth Gibbons . Governor Pyle said the defendants eventually would be charged variously with bigamy , adultery , open and notorious cohabitation , statutory rape , contributing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school funds and facilities , and falsification of public records . Initially , however , they were charged simply with conspiracy to violate state laws  --  a felony . Judge Gibbons informed them , one by one , of the charge , advised them that they would be held , pending bail , in county jail for preliminary hearing Aug. 31 , and set bail at amounts ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 . Three Called Leaders The higher sums were set for the three acknowledged leaders in the movement  --  Leroy S. Johnson , 65 years old ; Richard S. Jessop , 50 , and Carl Holm , 36 . Authorities planned to transfer the men by car to Kingman , the Mohave County seat , 400 miles away by the circuitous highway route around Grand Canyon . Meanwhile women deputies and State Welfare Department personnel were dealing with the women and children . The women defendants , fourteen of them under 18 years of age , are to be held in Short Creek under guard so that they may maintain their homes until foster homes can be arranged for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the women who indicated they wanted to sever connections with the movement . It was understood that the Arbotts authofities had received assurances from Mormon Church leaders that enough foster homes could be arranged quickly , and it was hoped to transfer the children and juvenile mothers as wards of the State Juvenile Court to Phoenix for placement in homes within a fortnight . The community , aside from spasmodic legal proceedings against a few of its members over the past two decades , - hact escaped prosecution up to now , Governor Pyle said , only because of its extreme isolation and because of the complexity of organizing thoroughgoing legal action against it . Today 's raid had . been in prep- ' aration for twenty-six months and involved an outlay of $50,000 , which was appropriated by the Legislature for unspecified " emergency " use . The Governor disclosed today he had secretly declared a state of insurrection July 1 , primarily to provide a legal basis for use of the funds . Ross F. Jones , the State Attorney General , said that in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a nuisance abatement statute , which would impose on the residents of Short Creek the cost of the entire expedition . This , along with a potential total of $500,000 or more in fines leviable against the community property , plus ' the prosecutions themselves , he said , was calculated to wipe out the community . The raid was conducted along the lines of a small-scale military operation by forty deputies under Frank Porter , Mohave County Sheriff , and eighty state highway patrolmen , supported by scores of other state functionaries . The officers set out in several parties more than twelve hours before the raid hour from both Kingman and Flagstaff , at opposite ends of the Grand Canyon . The northern Arizona " Strip " is approximately 130 miles wide and ranges in depth from fifty to 100 miles south from the Utah border . The area includes Kaibab National Forest and the northern part of Grand Canyon National Park . Short Creek is in the middle of the " Strip , " about 240 miles north of Phoenix . In 1935 county relief applications from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " families with the same head . State charges were filed against members of the community , and ultimately two leaders of the movement , Price Johnson and I. C. Spencer , received eighteen-month prison sentences for " open and notorious misconduct . " Even before their release from prison , Johnson announced his intention of making Short Creek ? then with fewer than 300 inhabitants ? " the biggest cooperative community in the West , " with as many as 15,000 members . Formally Set Up in 1942 However , the community lapsed back into obscurity until 1944 when Utah and Federal authorities rounded up some forty-six members of the cult on a variety of charges based on the practice of polygamy . The sect had been formally set up in 1942 as a voluntary association that claimed exemption under the laws of both Utah and Arizona from ordinary corporate accountability . Evidence in the ensuing prosecutions indicated that the cult had as many as 2,500 member ; that its headquarters was in Salt Lake City , manned by a patriarchal group of six trustees ; that they published a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of the group 's leading members circulated between residences in Utah and Short Creek where they maintained plural families . MORMONS BARRED POLYGAMY Doctrine Repudiated by Leaders of Church More Than 60 Years Ago Neither the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , which is the official Mormon Church , nor t Reorganized Church of Jesus arist of Latter Day Saints , an offshoot dating to 1852 , subscribes to polygamy . But the question of plural marriage has been an issue with the Mormons since 1843 , and a difficulty since 1890 has been convincing people of other faiths that polygamy no longer is a basic Mormon practice . Joseph Smith , . who founded the Mormons in 1830 , declared thirteen years later he had received an additional revelation proclaiming the doctrine of plural marriage . He and some of the Elders soon acted in accord with it ? acquiring more than one wife , although at first in secret . Official announcement of this supposed revelation was delayed until 1852 ? eight years after the secession of a group opposed to such practice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nauvoo , Ill. , on the east bank of the Mississippi . Inflammatory speeches and exaggerated versions of Mormon practices increased the tension . Martial law was proclaimed and Governor Ford of Illinois ordered Smith to appear in Carthage to answer charges . With his brother , Hyrum , he and other leaders went to Carthage , where they were jailed . Governor Ford pledged their safety on the honor of the state ? but on June 27 , 18444 a mob broke into the jail and killed both Smiths . Subsequently Brigham Yong led the Mormons west . The first Mormon settlers of . Utah subscribed in theory to plural marriage although only a small percentage of the people actually engaged in it . Nevertheless , brushes with the law were frequent , particularly during the Administration of President Zachary Taylor . In 1890 , after the United States Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of the anti-polygamy laws , Wilford Woodruff , then head of the church , issued a manifesto announcing his intention to submit to the laws of the land , and advising all Latter Day Saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October in the same year sustained the manifesto and thus withdrew approval of further sanctification of plural marriages . Thus polygamy actually has been a dead issue in the church for more than sixty years .
