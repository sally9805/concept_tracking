The Littlest Revue wound up the off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre 's season with festive intentions but pretty limp results . With but eight people in the cast , it is an intimate revue with a vengeance ; and with its faces so quickly familiar and its fandangos so modestly scaled , it stands in urgent need of witty sketches and catchy tunes . But the wit is uncomfortably sporadic and Vernon Duke 's show tunes sound remarkably alike . Best thing in the revue is Comedienne Charlotte Rae , who is herself at her best in a pair of screwy madrigal numbers . There are two or three entertaining skits , but the bulk of them are either dead on arrival or let their lifeblood ebb away .
