Said President Eisenhower in Manhattan last week , at a dinner for the National Fund for Medical Education : " There is on all sides a mounting demand for health services by our communities . Under these demands , the medical schools in America today face inherited responsibilities beyond what they are financially able to meet . The medical progress of which we are so justly proud has involved them in a struggle for solvency and survival . " <P> Behind the struggle lie serious problems without a single , simple answer . The U.S. has 218,000 active physicians , but many of these ( in full-time teaching , research , insurance , hospital or executive posts ) treat no patients . The bulk of patient care is performed by 90,000 general practitioners , 67,000 specialists , 18,000 hospital residents-a total of 175,000 , or one for every 983 population ( proportionately more than in any country except Israel ) . <P> How Many Graduates ? Eisenhower 's forecast that the U.S. will have 228 million population by 1975 means that to maintain the present patient-doctor ratio the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 12,000 a year now to about 15,000 . U.S. medical schools simply can not turn out that many . Last summer 76 schools with full ( four-year ) curriculums produced 6,796 graduates . Canadian schools and some in Europe , all with A.M.A. approval , supply about 2,500 more . So this year 's deficit is around 2,700 . As in several postwar years , the deficit will be made up by immigrant doctors , many of them trained in schools not approved by the A.M.A. <P> New schools are being opened ; by 1963 seven more will be graduating doctors . Even with these additions U.S. schools will not quite catch up with the demand . Bigger classes , sometimes suggested as a solution , are not feasible because in the final years students need detailed , bedside instruction by physician-professors . Although there are 90 students in the average class , usually there is room for no more than three or four students at a bedside . To increase the student enrollment would require a proportionate increase in faculty , which the schools could not afford even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mediocre medical school , there is one teacher* for every student ; in the best schools there are two . <P> How Much Money ? The cost of educating a doctor in the U.S. may range from $10,000 to $40,000 . Operating budgets for all the 82 med schools ( including six two-year schools ) in the last academic year totaled $111 million , an average of $16,000 per graduate . Of this , the students pay no more than $20 million ( 18% ) in tuition fees . Where does the other $91 million come from ? <P> Half the U.S. medical schools are run by states and cities ; government funds to the tune of $53 million a year make up nearly all these deficits . The other half are private , rely on income from endowments and general university funds for a total of $20 million . To balance , the schools need $18 million in gifts and grants . Research grants are no answer ; usually given for men and materials only , with no provision for overhead , they may make a medical college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
