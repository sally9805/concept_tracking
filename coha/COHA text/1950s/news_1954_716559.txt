The New York Giants won the 1954 world series yesterday when they defeated the Cleveland Indians 7 to 4 , for the fourth straight game . That was at 3:52 o'clock in the afternoon in Cleveland . At 8:29 O'clock last night the champions came home to receive a warm and boisterous welcome from jubilant crowds at the Marine Terminal of La Guardia , Airport . More than 2,500 happy New Yorkers  --  the recent animosities of the Giant , Dodger and Yankee rooters among them almost forgotten and melted in the surge of local patriotism  --  filled the termi ; nal and spilled into adjacent areas to shout themselves hoarse in greeting the new champions on their triumphal flight from Ohio . The tone for the welcome was set earlier yesterday by Mayor Wagner who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All New York ' is thrilled by the great victory of our own Giants . It is a proud occasion for this sport-loving town of ours , " the Mayor wired . The Giants came in on two chartered Constellations of the Capital Airlines . The first plane carried the team executives , the players and their families , while newspaper men and team aides followed in the second . Crowd Sends Up Cheer When the players ' plane taxied up to the apron and the door was opened , a wild cheer went up from the fans held back behind gray police barriers and a wire fence enclosing the field . Several dozen of them . managed to break past the police lines . They swarmed on to the field to grab the hands of the players and pat their backs . The first player to come down the ramp was Ruben Gomez , the pitcher who won the third game of the series . The last was James ( Dusty ) Rhodes , the hero of the whirlwind series . As he walked from the plane , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , Cheers and hurrahs greeted the appearance of Leo Durocher , who led his underdog team td pennant and series triumphs ; of Don Liddle , the winning pitcher yesterday ; of Johnny Antonelli who helped to clinch the victory ; of Monte Irvin , who batted in two ' runs in the final game ; of Willie Mays , the spectacular centerfielder ; and of the others who contributed to the Giant sweep , A pleasant breeze from Flushing Bay dispelled some of the humidity and clamminess of the evening as the players filed down from the aircraft in a shower , // ? SHARING THE JOY OF TRIUMPHr Manager Leo Duroeher with Horace Stoneham , the owner and president of the Giants , in the clubhouse after series sweep against Indians . GIANTS WIN SERIES , RAILED ON RETURN // ? , of applause from the cheering , drum-beating , and horn-tooting crowd . It was a stylish reception and a foretaste of the honors and accolades that awaited the Giants here . It preceded by an hour the victory dinner at the Biltmore iHotel , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the grand ballroom of the hotel , decorated with red , white and blue bunting , 400 persons , di ' rectly or indirectly connected with the victorious team , ate , drank and sang late into the night . A huge three-layer cake , surmounted by a Giant baseball cap of black icing , was ceremoniously cut by Horace Stoneham , the owner and president of the club . Midway in the festivities Mayor Wagner paid ' a call to extend the city 's felicitations to the victors . The Polo Grounds team , as far as the crowds at the airport were concerned , deserved the enthusiastic greeting as . much as any group of baseball players ever did . In capturing the world series from the Indians in four straight games , the Giants added an impressive page both to their own annals and to those of organized baseball , Thus , the Giants were met at the floodlit landing field as the first National League team since 1914 to make a clean sweep of the series in four games . It was their fifth world championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major leagues ) and their first since 1933 . And , perhaps the most important to the joyous fans , the team kept the title in New York for the sixth consecutive year . The airport scene was short in duration  --  only twenty minutes elapsed between the time the fourengined planes touched ' ground and the departure of the buses from the field  --  but it did not lack in drama or intensity . Durocher , tielese and clad in a dark gray suit , stopped long enough to kiss his wife  --  Laraine Day , the actress  --  and their tenyear-old daughter Michele , who had awaited him at the airport . Miss Day could not ' attend yesterday 's game because of a television engagement here . Their son Christopher , 9 , however , was in Cleveland with Mr. Durocher and returned with him last night . In a brief chat with reporters , Durocher refused to single out any player for credit for the victory . " They were all great , " he said . " It is a great team and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Day , wearing a gray summer dress , told reporters that the family planned to fly to California today for a vacation . She said her husband would relax playing golf . She said that the Giants ' victory was no surprise to her , but " I never had an idea that they could win in four games . " " If Leo thought so , " she added , " he never told that to me . " The crowd , which began to gather shortly before 6 P. M. , was good-natured and fairly orderly . Forty-five city police under Inspector Daniel Lake of the Twenty-third Division and thirty Port Authority patrolmen led by Inspector Edward Joseph were in charge of the arrangements . The heat and the excitement proved too much for a 65-yearold Giant fan , Mrs. Edmund Wheeler of 149th Street and Sanford Avenue , Flushing , Queens . She fainted about thirty minutes before the planes landed and received first aid in a near-by police garage . The planes originally were scheduled to land at the Domestic Terminal . When it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport operations , it was decided to shift the arrival to ' the Marine Terminal . This was announced over loudspeakers at 6:15 P. M. , and the early contingent of greeters. about 200 persons , walked and drove more than a mile to the Marine Terminal , which is the landing spot usually reserved for the President of the United States . The reception committee began to grow about 7 P. M. A drum corps from the Long Island City ( Queens ) Post of Veterans of Foreign Wars and a drum and bugle corps of the Military Order of the Cootie were on hand early ' in the evening to help to while away the waiting time . Four boys walked two miles from their homes in Elmhurst , Queens , with a bedsheet placard saying , " Welcome Home Champions . " Other signs expressed similar sentiments . Typical of the nonpartisanship in the welcome was a Dodger fan from Peekskill , N. Y. , who drove down with his wife even before 6 P. M. The fan , Bob Lancaster , a printer , was fulfilling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Giant backer , to be in the collective receiving line should the Giants win . Harry Brooker of 1548 President Street , Brooklyn , a Giant follower of thirty-five years ' standing , came with his wife , Ann , a Dodger enthusiast . The dinner was Lucullan . The guests had their choice of clams , oysters and shrimps ; two soups ; two seafood dishes ; turkey , ham , chicken , steak and cold meats , and three kinds of dessert . Ten chefs prepared the dinner and fifty waiters served it while fourteen bartenders labored over the refreshments . An orchestra , led by Marty White , provided the musical background In the ballroom , and when the players entered the room it struck up the " Giants ' March . " In the lobby they were serenaded with " Say , Hey " for Willie Mays and " Little Things Mean a Lot , " for Rhodes .
