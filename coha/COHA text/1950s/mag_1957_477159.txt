The first published report on Nazi Germany 's money factory ? a secret military operation , hidden in a concentration camp , which turned out British currency by the bale . . . but failed in its efforts to make $100 bills . ON MAY 26 , 1949 , Dr. Andre Amstein , chief of the Counterfeiting Bureau of the Swiss Police , forwarded to several of his colleagues in various Western countries carbons of a thick typewritten report about " the greatest forgery and counterfeiting enterprise of all time . " It was marked SECRET . Dr. Amstein , a sober police executive , is ' tot given to hyperbole . Operation Bernhard , the code name the Nazis used for their counterfeiting of some $600 million worth of British bank notes in World War II , was superlative in many ways . It was the biggest operation of its sort ever seen ; it distributed the most money over the longest period ; turned out some of the finest counterfeit notes ever made ; had the world 's largest counterfeit distribution network ; operated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most expensive equipment ever assembled for counterfeiting . It also had two superlative characters in its cast : Bernie and Solly . Recently , through the measured indiscretion of a friendly European official , I was permitted to inspect a copy of Dr. Amstein 's compilation which is labeled SECRET . 1 have also been able to learn a great deal more about Bernie and Sally , the mainsprings of Operation Bernhard . Copyright ? 1957 by Murray Teigh Bloom Considering its spectacular scope and nature , it is surprising that the full story has never been told before . Dr. Amstein 's report is SECRET for good reasons . For one thing it provides numerous technical details that would be of considerable value to anyone undertaking the counterfeiting of British pounds or American dollars . The Bank of England , unlike the U. S. Treasury , never discusses counterfeit notes and their telltale errors . Counterfeiting an enemy 's coinage or currency has been a tactic of most major wars since 1470 when the wily Duke Caleazzo Sforza of Milan used it against Venice . In World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a possibility President Roosevelt asked them to consider ? did make good facsimiles of Nazi ration stamps , which were dropped by air in 1940 . And counterfeit postage stamps of Germany and Occupied France were made to be used by secret agents and for the mailing of propaganda missives within those countries . In a far more important operation the United States Office of Strategic Services manufactured and distributed excellent facsimiles of Japanese currency . Officially this is still denied by the former OSS Director , Major General William Donovan , but the evidence I have seen is persuasive . In 1940 the Nazis decided to counterfeit British currency and assigned the task to Branch VI F 4 of the German Sicherheitsdienst or Secret Service which had been making excellent forgeries of neutral and enemy passports and identity papers in its Delbruckstrasse mansion in Berlin . The work proceeded slowly ? the Nazis had underestimated the technical difficulties of duplicating Bank of England paper , inks , and watermark . Not until the spring of 1912 when Captain Friedrich Walter Bernhard Kruger took charge of VI F 4 did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it acquired its code name " Operation Bernhard , " in honor of the thirty-eight-year-old Captain who ran it . Like most other key Nazis Captain Kriiger was not the beau ideal of Nordic physiognomy . Although he was about five feet , eight inches tall , his broad forehead and receding hairline somehow made him seem shorter . In repose his nose was straight and rather blunt , but when he laughed it seemed to change shape completely . He had a square chin , dark eyes , and looked younger than his years . He was born in 1904 in Riesa , about forty miles east of Leipzig . His father was a minor government functionary . Young Kruger was sent to the technical college in Chemnitz and after graduation worked in Chemnitz textile plants , then in Polish and French factories . In 1929 he lost his job and joined the growing National Socialist Party . Two years later he was made an SS man and rose steadily , attaining a captaincy in April 1939 . He trained SS personnel in radio operation and transmission . A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service and was sent to France to obtain samples of U. S. , British , Canadian passports ; identity papers for American seamen , wireless operators , and stewards ; and identity cards for Canadian airmen . Department VI forged these expertly . When Kruger was assigned to counterfeiting bank notes in 1942 ? largely because of his success in making the bogus Allied identification cards ? he found that his predecessors on the problem had been floundering primarily over the difficulty of reproducing the paper the Bank of England used . Since 1725 the Portal family of Laverstoke , England , has supplied the Bank of England with the white linen paper used for pound notes . Only once since then has anyone succeeded in getting any paper out of the plant illegally . This was in 1862 after James Griffiths , a Birmingham engraver with a counterfeiter 's ambitions , hired a team of London confidence crooks to go to Whitchurch and flim-flan a trusted Portal employee into sneaking out several reams . Kruger , an eminently practical fellow , did not count on duplicating that feat . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the handmade paper did n't conic out quite right until someone hit on the idea of laundering the linen after it had first been used to wipe factory machines . The elaborate watermark ? which covers most of the bank note with a series of parallel undulating lines interrupted at three spots with the denomination of the bill in numerals and letters ? was even more difficult to achieve correctly . When the paper formula had been solved , the old paper firm of Schleicher 8c Schull was given a large continuing order . The ink problems were solved by the Schmidt brothers of Berlin , and the expensive printing machinery was supplied by the firm of Rudolph Stenz . CONCENTRATION CAMP DE LUXE B Y AUGUST 1942 most of the technical problems had been solved satisfactorily and arrangements were made for mass production of the notes . In Sachsenhausen concentration camp , some twentyfive miles northwest of Berlin , Barracks 19 was suddenly cleared of all its miserable inmates awaiting death . A ten-foot wall of barbed wire was placed around the . building : regular camp guards were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SS guards was brought in to patrol the barracks . On their arrival the SS guards were lectured by the recently promoted Major Kruger . He made it clear that if anyone talked of or even hinted about the work going on in the barracks , he would be sent immediately to the Russian front . He also stressed in what must have been one of the most fascinating talks of the war that the prisoners were no longer verdamte Piden but co-workers in the triumphant National Socialist march toward world domination . From concentration camps all over the New Germany specially picked prisoners were sent to Sachsenhausen : a Czech engineer , a Norwegian stereotypist , a Viennese upholsterer , a French photographer , a Czech mathematics - professor , a Dutch army captain , a Danish bank clerk , - and , of course , several German Jews , including a Berlin fashion photographer and a printer . By the end of the month there was a company of thirty men , and Major Kruger , resplendent in his SS uniform , came down for a little talk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . He warned sternly against trying to escape or talking to anyone outside the barracks about their work . Their food rations would he excellent , comparable to what German heavy workers were getting . They would be permitted to read daily newspapers , get a cigarette ration , and even be allowed to have a radio . And if things went well , he promised , there would be a Ping-pong table in their quarters . All of them , he went on , were under his special protection . They would not be killed , he promised solemnly . After they had completed their task successfully and Germany was victorious , arrangements would be made for these handpicked Jews to live in a special enclave in an Aryan world where they would he employed on delicate jobs . Later one of the prisoners recalled this extraordinary talk : " We had been saved , many of us at the very last hour , from certain death . Now this incredible , amiable Nazi major was promising us not only that we would live , that we would eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provision had even been made for us to survive a Nazi victory . Imagine ! Even if we distilled out of his gallons of honeyed promises only a thin drop of vinegary truth it still all seemed like heaven on earth for most of us . " Kruger kept most of his promises . The food was adequate , the cigarette ration was pretty good , the newspapers came . There was a radio in the barracks . Ping-pong matches were held ? the Jews were rash enough to beat the SS guards ? and once there was even a night of amateur theatrical performances . The crew even got permission to wear ordinary civilian jackets and trousers if they wished . They wished . But there were also reminders from time to time that the Nazis were n't fooling ; that Barracks 19 was n't just a rest camp . Two SS guards who talked outside about the work in the barracks were given fifteen years at hard labor . A Russian Jewish student named Sukenik who caught TB was killed so that he would n't be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine had no more ardent practitioners than the inmates of Barracks 19 . By December 1942 the installation of a printing shop and an engraving section was completed . The paper mill at Hahnemuehle started a monthly delivery of 12,000 sheets of the specially made linen bank note paper . Each sheet would provide four bank notes . ENTER SOLLY T H E counterfeiting enclave was divided into five sections . There was the Printing Office managed by Arthur Lewin of Berlin . Kurz Weller of Vienna was made head of thc Bookbinding Shop , for the plant had other tasks in addition to printing British pound notes . Norman Levy , the former Berlin fashion photographer , was in charge of the photography section , and Abraham takobsen , a former Dutch army captain , took over the phototype section . In charge of the general office was Oskar Stein of Pilsen . In January of 1943 Barracks 19 received a new worker ? a small , slim , gray-eyed Russian Jew with curly dark brown hair , thick lips and eyebrows , and jug ears . His name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique : he was the only professional criminal in the lot . He had been born in Poltava , southern Russia , in 1897 and sent to art school at Odessa when he was sixteen . There he met Professor Eugen Zotow who was to have a profound influence on his choice of a life calling . Zutow , an excellent engraver and able artist ? some of his paintings hang in thc Hermitage Museum in Leningrad ? had served a sentence in Russia in 1912 far counterfeiting . Solly fled Soviet Russia in 1925 and alter a year 's hegira arrived in Berlin where he met his old instructor , now known professionally as Ivan Vernitchy . He had become a counterfeiter of British pound notes and quickly enlisted his former pupil in his ring . Solly helped round out some of the finer points on the plates , and to further his professional education was sent to Amsterdam to pass some of the ? 50 notes , In the summer of 1928 he was caught and served a two and one-half year sentence . In 1940 the Berlin police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making and passing ? 10 notes . Britain and Germany were at war then , but there were neutrals and Jews in Germany who hoped to get out of the country with a stock of British bank notes . Sally was sent to Mantliausen concentration camp where he won the favor of the SS guards and officers by doing their portraits in charcoal . Late in 1942 Major Kriiger came across his dossier and knew he was an ideal recruit for Operation Bernhard ? a professional . The first day Solly later recalled , I was introduced to Jakobsen who used to be a Captain in the Dutch Army . He said : " Here comes the man who will help us with our mistakes . Look how poor this work is " and showed me some of the British pound notes they had just made . Later I was introduced to Major Kruger , a small skinny man . Kruger was four inches taller and thirty pounds heavier than Smolianoff . He greeted me with kindness and said : " Well , we have been waiting for you .... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only a very hard prosaic life . . . . I know that you are in fear of death but if you do your work right and as long as I am chief you have nothing to fear . Behind this barbed wire you arc no more Jews but my fellow workers . Here we all work as a team in the fight for New Europe and the victory will be ours . And now go and do everything so that I do n't fall on my nose before Himmler . All my hope is based on you . " The king-size crackly E5 note was the favorite at Barracks 19 . Forty per cent of the notes made were of that denomination . The 10 , 20 , and 50 pound notes each accounted for 20 per cent of the output . . - Fifteen to twenty hours of preparatory work was done on each special printing machine before the paper was run through . After every hundred notes had been printed one of the machines was stopped and the vignette of Brittania seated in the upper left-hand corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to dry for a week . Now the examination squad took over First the notes were carefully assorted so that their serial numbers were no longer in consecutive order . Then each note was compared to a genuine note of the same denomination in a well-lit box with a clear glass surface . Then the inspectors sorted the notes into four categories : The very best were to be used only in neutral countries and to be sent with German spies operating in enemy countries . " Wahl 2 " was designated for paying off collaborators and quislings in occupied lands . " Wahl 3 " or Aburwrf notes were to be jettisoned over England by Nazi bombers in order to disrupt the British banking system . Four was the " Ausschuss " or junk category of unusable notes . The good notes were pierced carefully with a pin to make them look older . ( For generations English bank clerks have pinned notes together . ) Finally in the shipping room the note edges werecut with a file to give the appearance of handmade paper . Then the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprinted with the addresses of German embassies or legations in Sweden , Spain , Switzerland , Turkey , and Portugal . The envelopes were carried by diplomatic pouch . Profitable distribution was difficult . Paying off spies and saboteurs and quislings in counterfeit money conserved what little foreign exchange the Nazis had but it did not bring any foreign currency or gold into Nazi hands . The first attempt at mass distribution was made in France in the summer of 1943 . About 100,000 notes , mainly fives , were sent to a French bank through some VI F 4 agents , in exchange for foreign currency . Rut in a day the Nazi Military Administration officials heard about the deal and promptly put the French banker and his German friends in jail- A similar fiasco took place in Greece . Finally Walter Funk , Minister of Economics , laid down the law : Operation Bernhard was not to operate in any country occupied by Germany . Such intervention " might upset currencies he was endeavoring to stabilize . " Before long a distribution network for the bogus pounds was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from southwest Bavaria . His record included successful commercial ventures in the U. S. ( he had been a private investment counselor in New York ) , China , and even Soviet Russia during the NEP period . Schwend 's arrangement was a generous one : he would get a third of the gross take . In return he agreed to shoulder the entire risk and stand all losses from confiscations and the thefts of any unreliable sub-agents he might employ . Quickly Schwend got a network of agents in operation . Most of them were managers of large hotels in Sweden , Switzerland , Portugal , and Spain ; two were bank managers , a Swiss and an Italian . These sub-agents kept 25 per cent of their total take , but they , in turn , had to assume complete responsibility for their allotments of the false pound notes . By operating two neutral vessels out of Genoa and Trieste , Schwend was able to get his notes distributed widely in North Africa after the Allied invasion and in Spain and Portugal . In the main the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs . Operation Bernhard also provided forged notes for special tasks . The freeing of Mussolini in September 1943 from a resort hotel in the Abruzzi Mountains where he was held prisoner cost the Nazis $250,000 of their fresh pounds for information . Eliaza Bazna , the valet to the British Ambassador to Turkey , received about $1,500,000 in Operation Cicero . And the false notes were spent by the millions buying up parachuted arms given by the Allies to Serb , Groat , and Italian partisans . THE BOGUS $1 0 0 B Y APRIL 1943 the Bank of England suspected a vast counterfeit scheme . Its tellers spotted the duplicated serial numbers and noted that the black dots which surrounded the spelled-out denomination of the bill in the lower left-hand corner were a fraction of a millimeter too large . On April 22 , 1943 the Bank ceased issuing bank notes of ? 10 or higher and started withdrawing those already issued . In their place they issued new ones that incorporated an ingenious safeguard invented in 1935 by Stanley B. Chamberlain , an English expert on security paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread which acts as an electrical conductor in the paper , but the exact manner in which it conducts electricity is one of the secret tests for the paper 's genuineness . Yet the news that the Nazis were counterfeiting British pounds did not reduce that currency 's desirability to partisans , North Africans , and Frenchmen . Even counterfeit pounds had a considerable value of their own , an apparently paradoxical situation which has , however , occurred before , In China , from 1900 to 1910 , there was so much bogus paper money in circulation that the counterfeit notes were recognized as a kind of currency and business contracts stipulated whether payments were to be in real paper money or half cash and half counterfeit . And late in the nineteenth century at least one U.S. court ruled that a counterfeit $20 bill had a cash value . But there were parts of Europe where the bogus notes were not popular . Some partisan units in Yugoslavia insisted on German occupation marks in exchange for the arms dropped them by the Allies . When the Nazi Secret Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kruger was ordered to make German occupation marks . He and his crew did a fine job . " We will give them any kind of paper they want , " he joked with his co-workers . Toward the end of 1943 the RHSA , the newly formed top command of all Germany 's intelligence , secret service , and **25;1186;TOOLONG , decided to counterfeit U. S. dollars . In February 1944 a new section was set up in the ever-growing compound around Barracks 19 . There were now 140 inmates in the section working on two twelve-hour shifts so that the machines would not be idle . The average monthly output of pound notes at this time was 650,000 of which 260,000 , or 10 per cent , were serviceable ? that is , passed the tests for categories 1 and 2 . In all of 1944 more than 8 million British bank notes were made . Of these some 3 million , with an approximate value of $277,500,000 were deemed serviceable . By now Bernie Kriiger 's relationship with his co-workers was one of cordial friendliness . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners said later , " we liked Kruger . He was very decent to us . " ) His Saturday morning trips to Sachsenhausen from Berlin to pick up the best of the week 's production were always marked by his many compliments on the fine quality of the notes , his appreciation of their devoted efforts , and his assurances that they need worry about nothing . Work on the American $100 bill went slowly , however . News of the Allied landings in Normandy had a profound effect on the counterfeiters , and from the summer of 1944 onward they engaged in a colossal slowdown effort ? with the tacit support of Major Kruger hiMself . One Saturday morning in September 1949 , when a satisfactory $100 had still not been produced Kruger took the five section heads of the Barracks into his confidence . Personally , he was in no hurry for the American notes . Once they turned out the American bills there would be nothing more for the co-workers to do and there was every likelihood that he , Kruger , would be sent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he put pressure on Kruger who frantically reversed himself and begged his co-workers to produce a satisfactory bill quickly . Three days later Solly had a good sample of the back of the $100 note . Kurt Werner , Krtiger 's deputy at Barracks 19 , phoned Kruger in Berlin and gave him the good news . Two hours later the Major roared through the gates in his Mercedes Benz . Ever the showman , Solly exhibited his prize work against a theatrical background . On a green baize-covered table he placed fifteen genuine $100 bills ? shipped to Barracks 19 for comparison purposes by the inspectors ? and his half-completed bill . AU , of course , were placed face down so that sixteen Independence Halls were showing . Expectantly KrUger was led to the table and asked to pick out the counterfeit note . Kruger stood a long time before the table studying them Solly recalled but finally put his finger on the one he had chosen to be counterfeit . But it was genuine . . . . We were glad but he was ecstatic . Immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for Berlin with the counterfeit bill I had made . That night every one of our command was happy because we had heard that Himmler had okayed the work , appreciated our efforts , and had given the order to continue . The bitter-sweet quality of their success was not . lost upon them . How many more such Nazi compliments would it take to speed them to destruction ? By January 1945 Barracks 19 had reluctantly produced twenty $100 bills that had passed the inspection teams . These bore only provisional serial numbers until the date and number sequence mystery of the U. S. bills had been solved . Himmler saw the bills , approved them , and urged full production immediately . But in early 1945 Nazi Germany was n't in a position to mass-produce anything . The Hahnemitehle paper factory had been hit in several air raids . Less than 1,000 sheets of the carefully duplicated American paper , made of 50 per cent linen and 50 per cent cotton , was available . Then one Saturday morning Kruger came with an alarming piece of news : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British pound notes , mainly in fives and tens . It was getaway money for some Nazi leaders about to flee the country . A week later Kruger was back to take the huge batch to Berlin . He had been drinking heavily . As the notes were put in his car he told the five department heads the bad news : " I can not help you any more . If we lose the war all of you will be killed . " It was n't really news . For months the involuntary co-workers of Barracks 19 had known the Nazis would surely kill them to keep the details of the operation from reaching the victorious and presumably vengeful Allies . From February 1945 onward production of the bank notes was practically nil . Late that month Kruger was back with more dark tidings : He arrived unexpectedly Solly wrote and told everyone to prepare for evacuation . Everything was carefully packed . . . In March we left for Mauthausen . there all the ' machinery was unloaded and stored in barracks at the station ... we were personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or paper would be found on us . . . Whoever was found with something on him would be responsible for the death of the whole group . The men were kept on at Mauthausen concentration camp for a month . The boxed equipment was untouched . Then came orders from Berlin to move to Redl-Zipf in the Alpine redoubt where the die-hard Nazis planned to make their last Wagnerian stand . At Redl-Zipf all the plates and unprinted special paper were destroyed in hastily constructed outdoor incinerators . About $50 million worth of the poorer British notes were also burned . The time to drop them over England had passed . Paper could no longer win the war . On the night of April 23 Kruger appeared at Rec11-Zipf accompanied by a blonde . The Mercedes was packed with their belongings , and the Major added to his hoard a few more thousand of the first-class British notes . Without a farewell to his co-workers he took off for the last time and headed south . Later that night Kurt Werner , Krtiger 's deputy , had news for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the sad information that we had to be ready to be transferred early next morning Solly recalled . After his behavior and the expression on his face we understood that this was our last hour . .. . The next morning we loaded the cases with the bank notes on ten or fifteen trucks with trailers and then we were put in three trucks and drove towards Ebensee , the daughter camp of Mauthausen which had the task to destroy us . Only two of the trucks reached Fhensee . The men on these trucks , including Sully , were brought into the bathroom of the SS barracks to await arrival of the third group . Hours passed . The Ebensee commandant who had firm orders to kill all three truckloads without delay was torn between military obedience and a Nazi 's desire to do the job efficiently ? all at once . He waited . That night an SS officer came with a machine pistol and told the men he was going to kill them , right there . Desperately they argued it would be unjust to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the camp . All or nothing , they insisted . The officer was a fair-minded fellow . They were right . He put his pistol away . Later that night two of the prisoners escaped and reached a U.S. Army regimental headquarters fifty miles away . They urged the Americans to save their fellow prisoners . Solly wrote : On Saturday , May 5 , in the morning we saw the white flag put up by the inmates of the camp . The SS had run away and the inmates had taken over . The next day the American troops arrived in armored cars and soon after our friends in the third truck arrived on foot . The truck had been intercepted by a band of Austrian partisans who killed the SS officers and freed the prisoners , thus saving the lives of the condemned counterfeiters at Ebensee . JUST PAPER T W 0 of the other trucks with bank notes broke their axles on the rough mountain roads . The perplexed SS officer chucked the boxes into the Trawl river and sent his men home . The other trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British POW witnessed the sinking of the cases containing the notes and then the trucks in and thousands of the notes floated to the surface to be gathered by local villagers and a few sharpeyed U. S. soldiers . Many of the notes were recovered ? but not all . There was a great shortage of paper and a large number of the bills were used locally as toilet paper . U.S. and British agents quickly began a continent-wide hunt for the men who had worked in Barracks 19 . George McNally , a U.S. Secret with Service man on duty with SHAEF Headquarters , was particularly anxious to locate the plates for the fine $100 bilis the Nazis had made . Not until May 1947 did the U.S. catch up with Solly . He was picked up in Rome for selling a $500 bill on the black market . It was genuine but it brought Solly in for questioning . He was released after he told how the $100 plates had never been completed . Solly had married a comely widow in Rome . It was from his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . In 1948 Solly joined his wife in Montevideo where they lived with her brother , a successful bookseller. in 1955 the Smolianoffs left Uruguay and moved to a large southern city in Brazil . A friend who recently visited them reports that Solly is doing well as a commercial artist . But he does no engraving of any kind . His wife designs and makes children 's toys . They are pleased with their move to Brazil . And the amiable Major Bernie Kruger ? For nearly a decade he was the object of an intense search by British , American , and Soviet agents , who assumed that he might have taken some of the better plates with him . As it happened , there was a flood of bogus American $100 bills in Europe after the war but these were made by a Marseilles gang . Then in 1955 the wily ex-Major turned up in Hanover , West Germany . Turned up without his perfumed blonde , his Mercedes , and without much money ; turned up as a taciturn salesman on the outskirts of Hanover ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with no crime ? the British considered Operation Bernhard a legitimate ruse of war ? the Bonn government has left him alone .

Probably less than ? 10 million worth of the bogus notes was ever put into circulation by the still-missing Schwend and his crew . But even if every one of the circulated notes had remained undetected it probably would not have mattered greatly . Between 1939 and 1956 the Bank of England 's legitimate notes in circulation increased from ? 526 million to ? 1,912 million . When it conies to inflating currency the modern counterfeiter , no matter how well equipped and nrganized , just does n't stand a chance against a central bank issuing notes not convertible into gold .
