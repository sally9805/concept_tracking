" There is no room for independents in our political system , " said Democratic National Chairman Paul Butler , as he settled back to chat with students and newsmen at Ohio Wesleyan University last week . And he left no doubt in the minds of his Ohio listeners that he was talking about their independent Democratic Governor Frank Lausche . Lausche 's recent endorsement of the President 's farm bill veto " was quite shocking to Democrats everywhere-it was sharply in conflict with the majority . " If Lausche wins his Senate race against Republican Senator George Bender this year , Butler would not hazard a guess whether Lausche " would vote with the Democratic majority or the Republican minority . ' ' And as for Lausche for the Democratic presidential nomination , " I have n't heard much about Lausche in the party outside of Ohio . . . There has been no organized effort under the administration of Governor Lausche to do anything for our national party . " <P> Lausche , who has been politely mentioned as a presidential possibility by such powerful Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mc-Clellan , turned his thoughts only momentarily toward Paul Butler . " My strength , " explained the five-term governor , as if to the inexperienced and the young , " has been that no one has been able to dictate to me-bankers on down to labor leaders , strip miners , truckers , the utilities and the whole raft of them . <P> I can tell them all to go to hell except the people whom I 've tried to represent . "
