Argentina 's Minister of Interior summoned newsmen to his office last week and officially confirmed a red-hot rumor . It was true , said Minister Angel Gabriel Borlenghi , that the government of President Juan Pern had " intervened , " i.e. , taken over the governments of the provinces of Santa Fe , Santiago del Estero and Tucuman . Pern had summarily dismissed the governors , legislatures and all municipal authorities in the three provinces , and appointed three " interventors " with dictatorial powers , including authority to supervise the provincial courts . <P> Federal intervention of cities and provinces is an old Argentine custom , practiced by several Presidents before Pern , and recognized by the nation 's constitution . But Pern had not intervened an entire province for seven years , and Argentines assumed that he must have urgent reasons for the crackdown . According to stories floating about Buenos Aires , Pernista officials in the three provinces had gone in heavily for nepotism and graft , but last week Minister Borlenghi tried to dispel such unpleasant talk . " I want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the charges have to do with the honesty of the governments intervened . " The trouble , Borlenghi explained in phrases worthy of authoritarian doubletalk , was that the three provincial governments showed " a lack of interest in public service , " and failed to seek " the cooperation and advice of people 's organizations . " <P> In Argentina 's political vocabulary " people 's organizations " means the Pern-manipulated General Labor Confederation ( C.G.T. ) and the various Pernista associations of businessmen , professional men and students . In some cities and provinces , " people 's organizations " meddle in government affairs , and local authorities sometimes resist the meddling . At Pern 's closed-door meeting with provincial governors last month , spokesmen for the Pernista associations rapped several provincial officials for failing to pay " people 's organizations " due heed . Aware that more than three provincial governments took verbal stonings at the meeting , newsmen asked Minister Borlenghi last week whether there would be more intervening in the near future . Replied Borlenghi evasively , but no doubt accurately : " The federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
