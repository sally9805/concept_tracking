Crow 's anger over the recession , which was clearly shared by several million other voters , becomes particularly significant when con  --  trasted with his reaction to the great depres  --  sion . The 1930 's were tough years for Crow . Bouncing between jobs , he unloaded banana boats in Florida , tried installing furnaces , drove a truck at eighteen dollars a week . But he stayed off relief , which to him was impor  --  tant . " I 'd been brought up to think it was terrible if someone in your family went to the poorhouse , " he explained . " Roosevelt made people expect relief . It was pride with me to vote against him every time . I stuck Repub  --  lican until this fall . " Crow 's 1.958 conversion exemplifies the most significant feature of the last election  --  how much easier it has become to shift the party allegiance of the American voter . A quarter of a century ago all the hammerings of the harsh depression failed to shake Crow 's Re  --  publican loyalty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderate economic setback . Like Fred Crow , the electorate in general seems to have undergone a curious quickening of its voting reflexes . Between President Eisen  --  hower 's sweep of forty-one states in 1956 and last November 's debacle , the Republican share of the popular vote dropped thirteen per cent . This was almost as heavy a voting switch as was developed during the entire sixteen years between the peak of Roosevelt 's popularity in 1936 and the collapse of the New Deal coalition in 1952 . Clearly , Sputnik and Little Rock and even the recession provide only part of the explana  --  tion of last fall 's astonishing Democratic sweep . For the rest of the answer we must look to the strange new restlessness of the American voter , which has quickened voting change to a tempo never before known in our history . All the old rules of American politics must be re-examined . Currently , for example , the election of a Democratic President in 1960 would seem inevitable . Yet the triumphs of Rockefeller in New York and Goldwater in Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new target . The November balloting has been widely hailed as foreshadowing a " leftward " political turn , as if it heralded the second coming of Franklin Roosevelt . But was the election really a mandate for more abundant spending , as the stock market seems to believe ? Did the vote toll the death of conservatism ? Has the G.O.P. , as so many commentators warn , no choice now but to recast itself in the image of " liberalism " or face oblivion ? In my own judgment the answer to all three of those questions is " no , " It is wrong to view November 's ballot upheaval as a reassertion of the past , as if it had been brought about by the return to New Dcalism of all the onetime supporters of Roosevelt and Truman , Actu  --  ally , the Republicans last fall held congres ? sional districts which had been Democratic as late as 1948 and 1954 , even while suffering spectacular losses in districts which the New Deal never was able to breach . In 1936 , when the G.O.P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tricts held fast for the Republicans . Of those , twenty went Democratic last fall . Five had shifted in 1956 , but at least eleven had not sent a Democrat to Washington for thirty to forty years . It was not only in Maine and Vermont , but all over the country that lifelong Republi  --  cans voted Democratic for the first time . Why ? There was never any doubt at any time during the campaign that the Democrats would strengthen their hold in Congress . The surprising thing was that the expected G.O.P. losses developed into so utter a rout . And it is this near-collapse , of Republicanism that must be scrutinized if we are to understand what the future may bring politically , Is the G.O.P. crumbling so fast that a new one-party dominance is being born ? Or are we witnessing the ( Continued on Page 59 ) emergence of a weird new political insta  --  bility which , in turn , could overwhelm the Democrats just as spectacularly ? My own attempt to unravel this mys  --  tery is based partly on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last fifteen years and on two surveys of voter sentiment conducted last year . During the campaign I traveled through twenty cities and thirteen farm counties , systematically interviewing voters of every description . When the election was over , I analyzed the returns in all of the more important states , county by county , ward by ward and often precinct by precinct , to determine where the most meaningful shifts had taken place . I then went out into these areas to talk to more voters . What I found is not easily capsuled . Some voting shifts seem to have been in  --  spired by little more than the feeling voiced by one Nebraska farmer , " The Republicans ran things for so long I wanted to see what a Democrat would do . " Still , when all the scattered pieces ire put together , it seems clear that the lepublican collapse was caused by a col  --  lision of two sets of forces . One , centering upon economic issues , determined the direction that the vote took . The second set of influences , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trend of protest . As examples of these magnifying influences , let us consider the effect of just two things : Population change and the seemingly small matter of how ballots are set up . In Indiana , for example , as in Con  --  necticut and Maine , it is easy to vote a straight ticket ; you merely mark a single cross on the ballot or pull down one lever , Apparently that is what most Indiana voters did last fail . My interviewing showed that the main target of the voter 's ire was Gov . Harold Handley , who ran for the United States Senate . Even stanch Republicans denounced him for " raising taxes " and for " those highway scandals . " But swept along to defeat with Handley were six Republican Congressmen and enough members of the lower house of the state legislature to give the Demo  --  crats control for the first time since 1936 . Who the Congressman was seems to have made little difference . In the Tenth District , which takes in Muncie , Ralph Harvey , a five-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure fac  --  tory worker and political novice . During the entire campaign Harmon , who was sick at home for five weeks , made exactly one speech , at a C.I.O. picnic . He re  --  ported total campaign expenses of 5162 , of which 5105 went for gasoline . One Indiana township I visited  --  Dud  --  ley in Henry County  --  showed a Demo  --  cratic plurality for the first time in local memory . What upset precedent here was nothing more world shaking than a township trustee fight . " We 're Republi  --  cans around here , " explained one store  --  keeper , " but we felt this part of the town  --  ship ought to name the trustee . Our man ran as a Democrat . We did n't want to risk spoiling our votes , so we went for all the Democrats . " By contrast , in the state of Washing  --  ton , back in 1947 , straight-ticket voting by a single mark on the ballot was elim  --  inated by a Republican-controlled legis  --  lature . Instead , the voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual candidate . Last fall this bit of Republi  --  can foresight paid off , for although Democratic Senator Henry Jackson was re-elected with 68 per cent of the vote , the Washington congressional delegation remained unchanged at six Republicans and one Democrat . In the past . straight-ticket voting has usually been regarded as a bulwark of re  --  sistance to political change . But in 1958 it was ticket splitting which slowed the Democratic sweep , and straight-ticket voting that blew it up to astonishing proportions . Even more damaging to party tradi  --  tion have been the various factors operat  --  ing to make different parts of the coun  --  try more alike  --  and therefore more apt to swing together politically , The decen  --  tralization of industry has widened the geographical area through which unem  --  employment is felt . During the last decade perhaps as much as one fourth of the nation has been caught up in a mighty reshuffling of our population , from one state to another , from farms to the cities or cities to the suburbs . In itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting . However , migration does bring people from differ  --  ent backgrounds into new concentrations where they share similar economic and social surroundings and  --  if hit by the same event  --  may shift en masse , toppling the prevailing balance . Take the Second Congressional Dis  --  trict of Kansas . Bordering on Missouri , this district served as the staging area across which the whole tragedy of " Bleed  --  ing Kansas " was fought . But if Civil War memories still dominate the voting of many older residents , names like John Brown or Quantrell 's Raiders mean noth  --  ing to the settlers in the many new home developments along the highways leading to Kansas City . At first , most of these newcomers tended to vote as did the older Republican residents , but last fall they swung heavily for Gov . George Docking and helped elect a Democratic Congress  --  man for the first time since 1924. 1 went into one such development of new homes built since 1950 in Olathe . Most of the residents were under thirty-five . What struck me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for switching . A twenty-three-year-old inspector at the local Delco-Remy plant explained . " We were working only four days a week for a while . How could I pay for my house on that ? " Another family resented the cost of living . Two couples switched be  --  cause " the Republicans were for right-to-work " ; a salesman felt " we should take a firmer stand against Russia and not give so much money away abroad , " Four families cited local grievances which ranged from taxes and water bills to the fact that a nearby street was unpaved , and " where I came from you did n't have to buy school books for your kids . Here you do , " In short , throughout the development there seemed to run an urge to protest against something . against anything . As I listened to their replies I felt that these youthful families could not be counted as stanch adherents of either political party . They were not like trees , with rooted attitudes , but more like political tumbleweeds which roll with the chang  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds blow in 1960 will depend largely on whether the Republican leaders face up to exactly what caused last fall 's bal  --  loting to swing against the G.O.P. The recession alone was not responsible , At least three other factors were decisive  --  the failure to control inflation , a wide  --  spread loss of confidence in the President , and the drive to outlaw the union shop through right-to-work laws . Since the New Deal most union mem  --  bers have felt " the Democrats are for the workers and the Republicans for busi  --  ness . " However , a third or more of labor 's membership has generally voted Republican , largely because " we were born that way . " Right-to-work plunged many of these workers into a fierce con  --  flict between family tradition and eco  --  nomic interest . Elhanan Fisher , for example , was orphaned as a child and had been raised by a Kansas grandmother who drilled into him the belief that " the Republican tariff is the best protection for the Amer  --  ican worker . " But Fisher is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Docking be  --  cause he was against right-to-work , " Fisher explained . " But I 'm still a Re- pusbilmicai Ian in Ohio almost the heaviest showing against right-to-work came , sur  --  prisingly enough , in the Tenth Congres  --  sional district , which last elected a Demo  --  crat to Congress in 1912 . It seemed strange that so traditionally Republican an area should oppose right-to-work more strongly than some of the most in  --  dustrialized parts of the state . To find out why , I went into one county  --  Athens  --  in Southeastern Ohio , where outlawing the union shop was favored by only one fourth of the voters . Nowhere in the county did I find any  --  one who could be pointed to as the local leader of the right-to-work forces . ' Vet earlier in the year more than 1000 resi  --  dents of the county had signed petitions to put the issue on the ballot . What had happened ? One morning five men in succession drove into the station of a gasoline dealer in Nelsonville and told him they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right-to-work petition . " 1 tried to explain they had the wrong fellow , that I had n't signed the peti  --  tion , " the dealer recalled , " Those men told me the unions had listed the names of all the signers and distributed them to every union member . So I hotfooted down to union headquarters and got one of those lists and put it in my window . " Alongside the list the dealer propped a placard reading , THIS ESTABLISHMENT ' t ' Ile SATURDAY EvP , NtNo PAST IS AOAINST R1 ( 111T-TO-WORK . As the bitterness over the issue intensified , sim  --  ilar signs appeared in the windows of more and more establishments until he was a rash merchant indeed who did not display such a placard . A labor leader told me of a union meeting at which a worker who had signed the petition was called up before the membership . Frantic and in tears , this worker pleaded , " did n't mean any harm . Tell me what you want me to do . I 'll cut my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart from this campaign of intimida  --  tion , there probably was a deeper reason why no one in Athens County stepped forward to lead the battle to support right-to-work  --  the absence of a sizable middle class in either Athens or the neighboring counties . The hulk of the Tenth District 's constituents are factory workers , miners and farmers whose in  --  come per acre runs only half as high as the average for all Ohio . The kind of people who might have been expected to favor right-to-work simply do n't live in the community . The " business leader  --  ship , " consisting mainly of storekeepers , was quickly silenced by the threat of boycott . Still , the defeat in live states of the ef  --  fort to outlaw the union shop does not mean that the public is unconcerned about the abuses of labor 's power . Both during the campaign and after the elec  --  tion I repeatedly ran into workers who echoed one California truck driver . " These union bosses are taking us for a ride , " he declared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have unions with rack  --  eteers than be without a union. - Even in fairly well-off neighborhoods , ordinarily not sympathetic to labor , right-to-work seemed like an extremist pro  --  posal . In Los Angeles , Denver and Cleveland , the neighborhoods where the vote divided fifty-fifty were those with homes priced at 520,000 and higher  --  neighborhoods which had given Eisen  --  hower as much as two thirds of their vote . In such areas typical responses ran , " Unions should be kept from going too far , but I do n't think this is the way to do it . " In California and Ohio the militant solidarity that right-to-work gave labor seems to have caused even nonunion members to back away from the Repub  --  lican candidates . Still , all of labor 's efforts and the millions it spent on the issue would not account for the G.O.P. deba  --  cle . The fact is that the Republicans also lost large blocs of normally conservative voters , who see " red " when they think of unions . The key to this loss , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ure to control inflation . In past elections the fear of inflation has always helped the Republicans , just as the fear of depression has strengthened the Democrats ; for most people have long looked on the Democrats as spend  --  ers and on the Republicans as the one hope of slashing Government spending and reducing taxes . During the last cam  --  paign , however , the public anger over inflation hurt rather than helped the Republicans . In Amsterdam , New York , one middle-aged clerk told me that he wanted to see " both Eisenhower and Harriman out of there . " Asked why , he exploded in rage , " What was Eisen  --  hower 's platform ? He came in saying , ' Let 's throw the rascals out and save a dollar . ' But he 's spent just as much as Truman and Roosevelt ever did . " In South Bend , Indiana , a lifelong Repub  --  lican vowed , " I 'll either vote Democratic or I wo n't vote at all . I 'm tired of these politicians putting their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After I he election I asked many persons who had voted Democratic what they thought about the fact that some ob  --  servers were interpreting the election as a mandate for more spending . The response of Antoine Miller of Racine , Wisconsin , was typical . " The Government is spend  --  ing too much already , " he retorted . " I voted Democratic to get taxes down . " In Dodge County , Nebraska , which went Democratic for the first time since 1936 , I talked with six normally Republican farmers who had switched . Four said they voted Democratic " to get rid of Benson " ; three complained " taxes arc too high . " This ire at mounting taxes overrode party lines . In New York , Democrats told me they were going against Governor Harriman because of his failure to con  --  tinue a " forgiveness " reduction in the state income tax . In Pennsylvania , Hugh Scott beat Governor Leader for the Sen  --  ate mainly because of resentments that had been aroused by Leader 's tax policies . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in living costs even in the face of unemploy  --  ment . Both workers and housewives told me , " Wages and prices should be frozen like that OPA thing. - The wife of a young truck driver , who had voted for Eisen  --  hower twice , declared , " It 's terrible , Eisenhower just sitting there and letting prices go up month after month . How can you raise a family if you do n't know what anything will cost a year from now ? " It was amazing to listen to the conflict  --  ing reasons given for switching to the Democrats . One unemployed auto worker declared , " I was for Eisenhower , but no more . The Democrats build things that are n't needed , which costs money  --  but at least they keep everyone working . " Two blocks away an elderly couple launched into a tirade against " giving all this money away to foreigners ... prices going up . . . taxes jumping all the time ... waste of money shooting rockets at the moon . " The wife added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything on the ballot that cost me a penny . " Often one person would de  --  nounce the Republicans for being " too tight with money , " but a neighbor would protest , " The Republicans are on a spending spree . " On economic issues , in short , the voters were neither " liberal " nor " conserva  --  tivc " ? but plain mad . Far from thinking that the Democrats stood for spending and the Republicans for economy , the prevailing feeling was that " both parties spend just as much " or " inflation got out of control under the Democrats and stayed that way under the Republicans . " Right here . t believe , we come to the main reason for the completeness of the Republican debacle . The 1958 election was the first since the advent of Roosevelt in which the electorate saw no meaning  --  ful difference between the two parties on the crucial problem of inflation . The fact that even " born Republicans-were prompted to vote Democratic raises another point of historic importance . The stability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties ' being so much alike . But if this held true in the past , the weakening of the force of tradition suggests that the lack of clear-cut differences between the parties has become a major cause of voting insta  --  bility . If discontented voters see no real choice between the parties , they have two alternatives  --  either blindly to turn the " ins " out or to vote for the man , not the party . The use of these two alternatives by the voters explains many of the 1958 " upsets . " Most striking is the case of Nelson Rockefeller . Any Republican who , in his first try for elective office , can sweep New York State by half a million votes --  even while Sen. William Knowland losing California by a million votes --  merits being hailed as " a political natural " and " new , shining star . " But let us not overlook the fact that Rockefeller 's vic  --  tory was made possible by his being essentially the same as Governor Harri  --  man . " They 're both millionaires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the com  --  ment of several women I interviewed dur  --  ing the campaign . Other voters said , " There 's no difference between ' cm . Give me the new broom. - After watching both men on TV , people told me , " Rockefeller is eager to do a good job , " while " Har  --  riman looks old and tired . " Another re  --  vealing remark was , " We 've seen what Harriman will do . I 'd like to try a Recite-feller. - Senator Goldwater 's re-election in Arizona points a similar moral , although here the impact of personality mixes with the value of taking a clear stand on issues . Among a score of Phoenix voters the most frequently voiced comment was , " You knew where Goldwater stood , " while his opponent , Gov . Ernest McFar  --  land , " never took a position on any  --  thing . " Goldwater made a far better TV appearance , according to the persons I interviewed . And , like Rockefeller , he had a strong appeal to women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee for Political Education  --  C.O.P.E. ? to purge him ; for the Goldwater forces made the pres  --  ence of C.O.P.E . organizers the basis of a campaign to " save Arizona from fall  --  ing into the clutches of outsiders . " The Phoenix newspapers , intense supporters of Goldwater , went further and printed a police-line-up mug shot , numerals and all , of one C.O.P.E . chieftain . Some Arizona Democrats blame their defeat on the publication of this picture . But most observers feel that the photo , al  --  though it had some impact , was not de  --  cisive . In both Phoenix and Tucson , Goldwa  --  ter 's vote closely paralleled the vote for Eisenhower , precinct by precinct . This same parallel is seen wherever the Repub  --  licans won last November  --  in Oregon and Rhode Island , where Mark Hatfield and Christopher Del Sesto were elected governors ; in Delaware and Maryland , where John J. Williams and J. Glenn Beall were re-elected to the Senate ; in Dallas and Charlotte , where Bruce Alger and Charles Jonas succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly important finding . The fact that Republican candidates in such varied localities could hold the bulk of Eisenhower 's supporters suggests that the G.O.P. potential is far higher than indi  --  cated by their poor showing in the Con  --  congress races . Clearly , many of the things that were in people 's minds when they voted for Eisenhower still survive and can be revitalized if conditions are favor- able and the right candidate is running . To use a military metaphor , one might say that last November the Republican armies were not so much destroyed as that they were flung into a leaderless rout which has left them scattered and de  --  moralized , but in large part still there . Can these potential Republican forces be rallied by 1960 ? Much depends , of course , on the rival standard-bearers in the presidential campaign  --  and on what happens during the next eighteen months as regards three main issues : Civil rights , the threat of war , and the management of the economy . At this writing the odds are against the Republicans ' splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always possible if the northern Democrats February 14 , toss press hard to hold the allegiance of the Negro voters , Al that glance it might not Seem that the Democrats need to worry about losing the Negro vote . In twenty northern cities , whose returns 1 have col  --  lected , the predominantly Negro pre  --  cincts gave the Republicans only about one fourth of their vote compared to one third in 1956 . But in Richmond , Virginia , the Negro precincts voted 90 per cent Republican against Sen. Harry F , Byrd  --  dramatic evidence that Negroes will ig  --  nore the " Democratic " label if the civil-rights issue is drawn sharply enough . Continued peace  --  if that is an accu  --  rate term for the current state of the cold war -- could prove another Republican asset for 1960 . Many voters are grateful to Eisenhower because " he 's kept us out of war . " But sonic of this " peace " senti  --  ment is too intimately linked with Eisen  --  hower to be transferred to another Re  --  publican . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Presidents explains why a sizable bloc of voters say , " The Democrats always get us into war . " ? In the final analysis , however , pocket  --  book considerations will probably de  --  termine the next tenant of the White House . The weight of the peace issue varies with economic conditions , being a stronger G.O.P. asset in prospering times , like 1956 , than when offset by economic adversity . Also , currently at least , eco  --  nomic factors seem to be the most po  --  tent force reshuffling party loyalties . In fact , as we have seen , the voters may even have become overly sensitive to these issues . Many groups feel that they can  --  not protect their economic interests if their allegiance to one party is taken for granted . Also , the public 's expectations of what Government can and should do for them has grown to such inflationary levels that , as was shown last fall , even a moderate drop in performance is likely to trigger a surprisingly heavy political switch . But it is precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican hopes that a swift eco  --  nomic recovery may bring another spec  --  tacular swing , this time against the Democrats . The chances of this happening Pre brighter in the metropolitan areas than on the farms . After six years , Secre  --  tary of Agriculture Ezra Benson remains as unpopular as ever with farmers , and farm surpluses are no lower . The new program which takes effect this year is intended to move agriculture closer to free-market conditions . But most of the farmers I talked with said , " 11 will lower farm prices " even while " the rest of the economy is rigged for inflation . " Some farmers point out that during the recession " when steel was running at fifty-per-cent capacity and there were live million unemployed , wages and steel prices went up , not down . " They add , " How can the farmer go back to supply and demand if everything else is fixed ? " The horns of the Republican dilemma are further sharpened by the fact that much of the G.O.P. vote in the Middle West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of family custom . As economic pressures have increased , these farmers have been torn between tradition and economic in  --  terest . Each year more of them have been voting Democratic . One elderly Iowa farmer , a former Republican sheriff , complained , " Benson has said there 's too many of us small farmers . The Republicans do n't care for anything but business . " As we talked , his wife shouted up from the cellar , " Tell him how the Republicans make little fellows littler and big fellows bigger . " In the urban-suburban areas the long-range trend of realignment was working in favor of the Republicans  --  until the recession reversed it . Mainly , this trend reflected the rapid expansion of the na  --  tion 's middle class since the end of World War Ii . As of today there remain at least three doubts as to whether the political solidarity of the middle class can be re  --  stored to the G.O.P. by 1960 : First , can the Republicans recapture their lost appeal as the party that opposes inflation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity as " the party of business , " which is perhaps the biggest single Re  --  publican political liability ? Third , will Eisenhower demonstrate more vigorous leadership during the rest of his term ? Although the President can not seek re-election , it will he his Administration that most people will vote for or against in 1960 . At his press conference the morning after last fall 's election the Presi  --  dent remarked that if the people " want me to do anything else , I do n't know ex  --  actly what it is . " Some correspondents shrugged off the comment as post-elec  --  tion irritation , but it contained consider  --  able truth . Actually , the public has not drifted from the President because of any wide disagreement with specific policies he has advanced . The loss of faith in Ike springs from a fear that " he lets too many things drift . " Some of this concern stems from worry that his illnesses may have sapped his physical energy and left him too de  --  pendent on his aides . Frequently during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is Eisenhower really running the country ? " Particularly on ec  --  onomic problems , much of the public feels that it has lost contact with the Pres  --  ident . Through all the recession months Eisenhower never made a talk to the nation . At the time , I was conducting a survey across the country , and house  --  wives and workers would ask me . " Why does n't the President tell us what he 's thinking ? " Of more basic significance , perhaps , is a growing anxiety that some of our more vital problems are slipping out of con  --  trol . This feeling was certainly aggravated by the Quemoy and Matsu crisis , which to many persons threatened to " back us into the same corner we got out of in Korea . " In no previous election survey had I ever encountered such a mood of frustra  --  tion and anxiety . It quite plainly had stirred among the people a desire to " do something different . " But there was no response to this mood from the White House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summed up many opinions last summer when she complained , " The whole world 's in an uproar . But what is Eisenhower doing ? He 's playing golf . " Presidents rarely swap natures in mid  --  stream . Still , it seems questionable that the Republicans can win in 1960 unless the President recognizes that the easy  --  going , conciliatory leadership that was so successful in his first term no longer fits the public temper . If 1958 holds out one dominant lesson to the Republican Party , it is that the G.O.P. must stand for something definite politically . Trying to be all things to all men , the last election showed , invites being blamed by all men for all things . In concluding my 1958 campaign series I wrote , " Politics in this country has come to be conducted as if the choices before the nation were as simple as pie in the sky . But the course of events in the world suggests that the only real choices we have are difficult ones . Until this gap between the promises of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither party is likely to be able to hold a majority of the electorate for long . ' To function effectively in what amounts to a managed economy , with an almost daily intervention in affairs abroad , both our parties must confront us with signifi  --  cant distinctions in terms of the choices we really have . If that is not done , the public will either reject all parties in favor of a personality , as France has done with Dc Gaulle , or toss its frustrations from the " ins " to the " outs . " And if that hap  --  pens  --  and it already is happening  --  we will find ourselves plunged into an era of indecisive landslides in which it will be easier to throw officials out of office than to explain what is expected of their suc cessors.
