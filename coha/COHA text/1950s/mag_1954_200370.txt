Thousands of words have been written and spoken around the world about the philosophy underlying the Eisenhower Administration 's foreign and defense policies . Last week John Foster Dulles achieved the clearest interpretation of what the new policy means . <P> The old policy , Dulles pointed out in a speech in Manhattan before the Council on Foreign Relations , reacted to Communist moves and met local aggressions on a local basis . The new policy is based on an entirely different concept . It places " more reliance on community deterrent power and less dependence upon local defensive power " ; it plans for the " long haul , " and not merely for the sudden emergency . <P> " Local defense will always be important , " said the Secretary of State . " But there is no local defense which alone will contain the mighty land power of the Communist world . Local defense must be reinforced by the further deterrent of massive retaliatory power . <P> " A potential aggressor must know that he can not always prescribe the battle conditions that suit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is glutted with manpower might be tempted to attack in confidence that resistance would be confined to manpower . He might be tempted to attack in places where his superiority was decisive . The way to deter aggression is for the free community to be willing &; able to respond vigorously at places and with means of its own choosing . <P> " Now , so long as our basic concepts in these respects were unclear , our military leaders could not be selective in building our military power . . . We had to be ready to fight in the Arctic and in the tropics , in Asia , in the Near East and in Europe , by sea , by land and by air , by old weapons and by new weapons . . . " <P> The inability of the military leaders to select weapons caused the swollen defense budget . They could have continued to buy everything that might turn out to be useful in situations picked by the enemy if Eisenhower &; Co. had not formulated a political policy which gives the military a standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be changed , the President and his advisers , represented by the National Security Council , had to make some basic policy decisions . This has been done . And the basic decision was ... to depend primarily upon a great capacity to retaliate instantly by means and at places of our choosing . . . And as a result , it is now possible to get , and to share with allies , more security at less cost . " <P> Sharpening the broad picture to fit a specific case , John Foster Dulles said : " This change gives added authority to the warning . . . that , if the Communists renewed the aggression in Korea , the United Nations response would not necessarily be confined to Korea .
