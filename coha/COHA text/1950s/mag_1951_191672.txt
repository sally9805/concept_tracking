All Dubuque was taking sides last week , either with the good ladies in church clubs or the lusty wenches of fiction . <P> It all began when the chief of police scooped up a lot of 25 reprints off newsstands , surveyed a collection of busty , flamboyant dames on the book jackets , and accused a distributor of peddling obscene literature . Then County Attorney John Duffy , a Notre Dame graduate who takes his knowledge of literature seriously looked over the evidence . The obscene books turned out to include bestsellers by Somerset Maugham , MacKinlay Kantor and John Steinbeck , and a collection of art masterpieces which had in it nudes by Velasquez and Titian . He dismissed the charge and for doing so forthwith got the clubwomen on his neck . They thought that such books should be barred from the newsstands and put out of reach of children . Duffy invited them to appear before the Dubuque grand jury and state their case , countered by sending two officers to the public library with a warrant for the seizure of copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rabelais ' works . <P> Both sides decided to state their positions clearly . Duffy explained his library raid : " The action was taken so we will have something for the grand jury to use in making comparison . I 'm no expert on obscene literature and I do n't believe the grand jury is either . " <P> Mrs. Anthony Eberhardt , a mother of school-age children , was spokesman for the women 's group which included the Catholic Mothers ' Study Clubs , the Council of Protestant Churches and the Dubuque Parent-Teachers Association . Said she : " We are not trying to influence adult reading or adult thinking . We are merely trying to remove what is objectionable to children . Of course , if this restriction is incompatible with freedom , then we agree that freedom is more important . " <P> Duffy subpoenaed a couple of English professors from the State University of Iowa to tell the jury the difference between a classic and a dirty book . After his session with the grand jury , Professor Paul Engle summed up his observations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was really obscene . I think a lot of these novels are cheap , badly written books , and are a lot more likely to corrupt a child 's prose style than his morals . " Then Professor Engle got down to a point that really troubled the clubwomen of Dubuque : " I think if these books had come out in quiet jackets the whole controversy might not have started .
