My Man Godfrey ( Universal ) . Farce , like souffle , ca n't be warmed over . Back in 1936 , when this piece of fluff came hot from Hollywood , it was crisp and light with the most expensive ingredients ( William Powell and Carole Lombard ) . But a couple of decades have somehow taken the puff out of the stuff . At second serving it looks , as the French say of second servings , a little senile . <P> The new plot is much the same as the old . A rich young girl ( June Allyson ) collects a dockside derelict ( David Niven ) , takes a liking to the fellow , and offers him a job as the family butler . To everybody 's surprise , he buttles superbly , bottles seldom , and battles tirelessly for the best interests of his employers-a group of people about as easy to live with as a family of full-grown crocodiles . In the end , of course , the butler has the crocodiles eating out of his hand , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up in marriage . <P> It 's an amusing situation-so why is n't it a more amusing picture ? Allyson and Niven can hardly be expected to fill the bill with anything like the inspired inanities of which Lombard and Powell were capable . But the real fault seems to lie with Director Henry Koster. who apparently has not learned that even a good joke can be spoiled by bad timing . <P> Perri ( Buena Vista ) is a squirrel who , presumably , was walking along the main stem one day , minding her own business , when along came a fellow from the Walt Disney studios and asked her how she would like to be in pictures-not in any old cartoon , but in a brand-new sort of thing called " a true-life fantasy . " Assuming that her squeals were intended to signify delight , the fellow promptly popped her into a crate , and away she went bouncing to fame and misfortune . <P> They gave her the big buildup . In the first days of shooting she was photographed-in Technicolor , of course-peeping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounging in her penthouse , peeking roguishly from underneath the rumpled bedclothes . No doubt remembering the animated vermin that made such a popular success as Cinderella 's coachman , Producer Disney surrounded her with plenty of cute little " real-life " mice . He also plumped up the supporting cast with the famous bunny brigade , the <P> Disney equivalent of Mack Sennett 's bathing beauties , and added to that the well-known family of skunks . He even permitted Bambi to make a guest appearance in the picture-anyway , when a young buck appears , that 's who the narrator says he is.
