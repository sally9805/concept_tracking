IN THE DAYS OF MCKINLEY ( 686 pp. ) - Margaret Leech-Harper ( $7.50 ) . <P> Had the man from Mars said , " Take me to your leader " in the days of President McKinley , many an American might have answered , " What leader ? " Few U.S. Presidents have exerted so colorless a leadership from the White House , and few have faded so quickly from the nation 's memory . In a new biography , Pulitzer Prizewinner Margaret ( Reveille in Washington ) Leech thoughtfully recalls a President who was widely loved , sincerely devoted to his country and to the Christian virtues , but who remained even in historic moments ( as Author Leech puts it ) " the captive of caution and indirection . " Her biography gives McKinley his due and his comeuppance too . If he remains as short of color as ever , he will at least be better understood . <P> Front-Porch Campaign . McKinley was a Puritan by inheritance . His father , an Ohio pig-iron founder , gave Will 's mother the most austere wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a refreshing drink of water ( the month was January ) . The son was as free of vice as he was of intellectual curiosity . Throughout his life , his favorite plays were Rip Van Winkle and The Cricket on the Hearth . Methodist McKinley 's only unseemly heritage from the smoke-filled rooms where he started his political career was the habit of smoking an occasional stogie ( he chewed , too , while Governor of Ohio , and his spittoon aim was fine ) . <P> As President , McKinley almost always expressed himself in sonorous platitudes , but never did he come closer to stating a political creed than in a speech made when he was running for Governor in 1891 : " We can not gamble with anything so sacred as money " ( what he meant was the sacredness of the gold standard ) . Sitting out the first presidential campaign ( on his front porch in Canton , Ohio ) against Bryan in 1896 , he must have been shocked by the Nebraskan 's notion that mankind was being " crucified on a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Author Leech emphasizes what is really at the heart of the McKinley story : this hymn-loving , humanity-loving man of the people was as much the favorite of the wage earners as he was the darling of the millionaire industrialists . <P> Blind Loyalty . He hated war ( he went from private to major in the Civil War ) , but took Cuba , Puerto Rico and the Philippines in a war that was as close to comic opera as a shooting war could be . Some members of the Cabinet were so incompetent that only blind party loyalty could account for his devotion . His political mentor , Senator Mark Hanna of Ohio , was so obviously the errand boy of the trusts that not even the wildest admirer of McKinley could hope to explain away the President 's regard for big business . Yet Author Leech shows McKinley as his own man . If he rooted for the trusts , it was because he believed that business and U.S. destiny were on the same path . If he took the U.S. into war and a great-power role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck for isolationism.
