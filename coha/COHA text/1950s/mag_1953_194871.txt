As the night train for London pulled out of Normanton station . Yorkshire , a little man with a greying , Chaplinesque mustache quietly took his seat . The other passengers , if they noticed him at all , certainly did not recognize Atomic Spy Alan Nunn May , for whose release over 30 reporters were at that moment waiting outside nearby Wakefield Prison ( see PRESS ) . <P> When reporters caught up with him a few hours later in the London suburb of Chalfont St. Peter , his sister-in-law at first denied that he was in her home , then the following day handed out a typewritten statement signed " A. N. May " : " I myself think that I acted rightly and I believe many others think so too . " May tried to justify his delivery of vital atomic information to Russian espionage agents ( TIME , Jan. 5 ) by saying : " I was wholeheartedly concerned with securing victory over Nazi Germany and Japan . . . My object now is to obtain as soon as possible an opportunity of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some service to this country and to my fellow men . " <P> May was now free to move where he liked . Anticipating charges of pussyfooting with atomic spies , the British government ( which wants to share U.S. atomic secrets ) supplied its overseas missions with this guidance : since Nunn May , under the rules of good behavior , has served his term , " it is better to release him now and see if it is possible to change him into an honest citizen than embitter him by detaining him for the full sentence . He retains his ability as a scientist , but after seven years his atomic knowledge is no longer of value . " <P> Then came a shocker : " If Nunn May wants to go to Russia , and the Russians want him , there is no general power to prevent a British subject from leaving the United Kingdom , with or without a passport . Nunn May does not have a valid passport . Refusal to grant him one could hamper him , but would not prevent him from leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
