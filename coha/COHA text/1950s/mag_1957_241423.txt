Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> A man who can be calm when there is anything to be calm about , ex-President Harry Truman brushed aside a $1 bill proffered for his autograph , and declaimed : " I just ca n't sign them any more . And you know why ? That damned Attorney General would just love to put me in jail . You ca n't deface currency-that 's the law . " Asked if he was joking about Attorney General Herbert Brownell , Truman snorted : " No , he is no good . " In Washington , a Treasury official passed the word : the Treasury ' " never has held that autographs or minor writing on currency is a violation of the law " ; in fact , outgoing Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey has sometimes autographed banknotes himself . <P> <P> A blue-ribbon geneticist but a nearsighted political red , Britain 's peppery J. B. S. Haldane , 64 , sees the world darkly , from under a pair of shaggy eyebrows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache . Long a caustic observer of Britain and of most of the human race ( as its successor , he once proposed the rat , " an animal of considerable enterprise , which stands as good a chance as any other of evolving toward intelligence " ) , Haldane for years ( 1940-49 ) was editorial chairman of the London Daily Worker , was undisturbed by such political incidents as the Berlin blockade and the coup in Czechoslovakia , boggled only after the Kremlin offended his sensibilities as a scientist by proclaiming the doctrines of Geneticist Trofim Lysenko as undebatable Communist truth . Last week John Burden Sanderson Haldane carried out an old threat , flew away from Britain headed for neutral ground more congenial to his oddly balanced mind . His last blast , as he took off for India : " I want to live in a free country where there are no foreign troops based all over the place . Yes , I do mean Americans . " <P> <P> The British press , which had dreamed up a romance between Princess Margaret and handsome , horsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beresford , currently serving as an officer in the Royal Horse Guards , had been ordered to a tour of duty overseas ( Cyprus , in October ) . Concluded London columnists : Lord Patrick was being exiled at palace request . The young nobleman himself obligingly declared that , rather than go to Cyprus , he would resign his commission and become a jockey . Beresford changed his mind next day , and by week 's end the monarchy was still secure , Beresford was still headed for Cyprus , and the press had another crisis to gasp about : at a garden party , too much healthy princess brimmed out over Margaret 's low-cut gown . Twittered Daily Expressman William Hickey : " Could one or two extra pounds-a few extra dishes of strawberries and cream , a few extra ice creams at parties-have given the gown a look that was n't intended ? " <P>
