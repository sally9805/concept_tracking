J. P. Morgan was once asked by a friend : " How much does it cost to run a yacht ? " Boomed the great J.P. : " Sir , if you have to know how much it costs , you should n't own one . " Last week , as the 43rd annual Motor Boat Show opened in Manhattan 's Grand Central Palace , it was evident that Morgan 's rule of thumb no longer applied . In the biggest show in history , 248 exhibitors displayed boats for every pocketbook-from $39.95 for a shrimp boat to $72,700 for a cabin cruiser . <P> For those who like to pinch pennies in their own workshops , the build-it-yourself business had the widest assortment of models yet . On view were 38 different models put out by seven kit-boatmakers , ranging all the way from 8-ft. prams to cabin cruisers . U-Mak-It Products , which had 15 models on show , also puts out a kit for a 23-ft. cabin cruiser ( see cut for $844 without motor , a saving of about $1,000 on the readymade model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice as much as 60% from the price of a factory-made boat . <P> For other dollar-conscious sailors , there were also sailboats and cruisers from Canada , Britain and The Netherlands , most of them built at prices well under those of U.S. yards . Queen of the fleet was the 55-foot cabin cruiser Capri , built by First Export Association of Dutch Shipbuilders ( FEADSHIP ) in its Aalsmeer yards . One of a line of more than 30 pleasure craft FEADSHIP has constructed for U.S. buyers , the Capri will sell for $72,700 , a saving of upwards of $20,000 over a U.S.-built boat of the same size . Already on FEADSHIP 's books are orders for 30 more boats for U.S. buyers , from a $9,500 30-footer to a 122-ft. luxury cruiser . <P> Other eyecatchers : <P> Plasti-Craft 's streamlined XL-525 , a 14-ft . Fiberglas-reinforced outboard runabout . Made of Owens-Corning Fiberglas and plastic , the hull needs no paint or calking ( price : about $575 ) . Other Fiberglas boats on display : Lunn Laminates ' 18-ft. sloop , Challenger , Ray Greene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U-Mak-It 's Everglasting and Kristal Kraft kits for owners who want to apply glass-fiber coatings to their own boat bottoms . Though the cost of coating a 16-ft. hull ( roughly 40 per square foot ) may run as high as $50 , the companies say one coating is sufficient , leaves boats with a leakproof bottom that defies such things as fungus , barnacles and dry rot in fresh and salt waters . <P> General Motors ' $2,500 , 87-h.p. diesel engine , the smallest G.M. has ever made and suitable for a 26-ft. boat . G.M. claims it is safer and more economical than standard 100 h.p. ( $600 ) gas engines , plans to turn out 5,000 of them this year . <P> The one-hand " twist-grip " handle for steering and speed control on almost all new models of outboard motors , some of which reverse the motor with a twist of the wrist .
