txt Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio demanded today a Congressional veto power over the dispatch of any American ground troops to help in Europe 's defense . He proposed other Congressional restrictions as well . Mr. Taft , Republican policy leader of the Senate , rejected , moreover , - the basic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty arrangement for creating in Europe an international force sufficient to deter , if not necessarily actually to hurl back , any Russian invasion . " I ca n't see this ' deter ' business , " he asserted . Accordingly , he not only insisted that Congress have the privilege of approving the size of any troop commitment but also asked that Congress have the right to forbid any commitment until the Europeans had provided , with whatever American contribution was made , " an army sufficiently powerful to withstand an attack on Western Europe , including occupied Germany . " No American contribution should be made , he said , to a legion that was only a deterrent . It should be large enough actually to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees . Sitting jointly , they are considering the degree of voice that Congress should have in the Truman Administration 's decision to assign American divisions to a European defensive army under the command of General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower . The Senator accused the Administration of deliberately misleading the American people into supposing that the recently announced decision to send four more divisions , to join two already in Europe , would be the end . " The refusal of the Administra- tion to agree to any limitation , even if peace in Europe continues , " he said , " raises a clear presumption that they do contemplate sending more troops in the future . " All they ( the Administration leaders ) want is to be able to come back here and ask next year for six more divisions without violating their word . " He asserted that the American contribution , unless the Administration was restrained , might well reach eighteen divisions , which could involve about 900,000 men . Senator Taft testified in support of a resolution by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska , that would have the Senate admonish the President to send no troops until Congress had approved a policy governing their use . Mr. Wherry , as minority floor leader , is ordinarily responsible for the tactical movements of the party 's forces in the Senate . Mr. Taft , as chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee , has an important hand and often a decisive one , in the formulation of the basic Republican strategy on domestic matters . Senator Taft in his testimony went a great deal beyond the Wherry resolution , which he regarded as merely a stopgap to halt any present commitments until detailed restrictions by Congress could be prepared . Taft Offers Program As for these restrictions , he advocated that both houses of Congress by joint resolution , which would have the force of law unless successfully vetoed by the President , stipulate the following : 1 . No American " armed forces " ? presumably meaning air and sea units as well as troops  --  should be assigned to the international army under General Eisenhower 's command " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty Organization by members of that organization , or other nations , to assign to that army within a reasonable period of time a total number of armed forces to provide an army sufficiently powerful to withstand an attack on Western Europe , including occupied Germany . " 2 . The President should " accept the certificate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as to the number of armed forces necessary to provide an army sufficiently powerful for that purpose . " 3 . " Any agreement entered into by the President committing the United States to assign armed forces to such an army prior to any attack on any member of the Atlantic pact organization , including Western Germany , shall state the general character and number of forces to be assigned and shall be subject to the approval of Congress . " In offering this plan , which would involve the sharpest limitations over the Administration yet proposed by any major Senate fig- ure , Mr. Taft made it plain that he regretted the necessity of sending any American divisions . Nevertheless , he said , he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to accept the decision to send four more divisions , but only with the understanding that Congress hereafter would require a ratio of nine European divisions for every additional American division . Choice of Eisenhower Hit He declared that Mr. Truman 's selection of General Eisenhower to be the supreme commander in Europe was unwise because it would tend to make the whole defensive set-up " an American enterprise . " General Eisenhower , Mr. Taft added , was a " great " officer , but the Europeans had unanimously insisted on him not so much for this reason as because " they were anxious to have him so America would be hooked in . " Asked by Senator Virgil Chapman , Democrat of Kentucky , to suggest a better selection , Mr. Taft demurred , saying that he was " not an expert on generals . " " Do you know of any American general in whom the American people would put more trust than in Eisenhower ? " Senator Chapman inquired . " General ( Douglas ) , perhaps , " Senator Taft said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Taft , who on Saturday had been accused in effect by Governor Dewey of New York of clinging to " a little toehold of isolationism , " did not hit back hard at the Governor . He did assert that there were " violent assumptions " in Mr. Dewey 's expressed view that the loss of Europe to the Russians would be fatal to the United States . Senator Taft would go only so far as to say that the overrunning of Western Europe would make " more difficult " the defense of the United States . He asserted , however , that if such an event should occur , the United States Army need not be particularly enlarged over its present planned strength , though " more power " would have to be given to the Air Force . Much of Senator Taft 's argument , in which he supported his theory that the principal contribution of this country to the free world should be in sea and air power , was based on economic factors . The military establishment now being planned here , he asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the limit that this country could maintain in economic health , and further ground troop commitments to Europe would tend to put the budget well beyond the danger line . John Sherman Cooper , a former Senator from Kentucky and now Republican adviser to Secretary of State Dean Acneson , told the committees in advance of Mr. Taft 's appearance that an American refusal to help Europe " could be the greatest surrender in history . " He testified that after months of work with the treaty organization , some of it in Europe , he was convinced that the Europeans intended to do their part . He recalled that last August , in the earlier days of the project , he had believed otherwise , and that he had so said in public . To refuse to send grounl troops to Europe , or to limit their use , he asserted , could " kill the effort and the confidence now developing . " This effort and confidence , he added , were very strong now .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
