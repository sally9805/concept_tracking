Ever since 13 Jews sat together at the Last Supper , in the historic dawn of a new church , the conversion of the Jews has been Christianity 's hope , but there have been few signs of fulfillment . Now some Protestants seem to be launching a new movement to proselytize the Jews , reports Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg in the Christian Century . But , warns Hertzberg , it will not work , and should not be tried . <P> A leading proponent of Jewish conversion , Presbyterian Minister George E. Sweazey ( TIME , May 4 ) , argues that Jews are ripe to become Christians because " many Jews in America scarcely have a religion " and that " even those who cherish a strong sense of the Judaic tradition often seem to hold it as a sort of super-intense patriotism . " Conservative Rabbi Hertzberg ( of Temple Emanu-El , Englewood , N.J. ) denies both these statements . American Jews may be losing their identity as an ethnic minority , but the percentage affiliated with synagogues has risen strikingly . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hertzberg thinks Christian sects have similar problems . <P> " American Jews , " says Hertzberg , " do not look to the church down the street as the bearer of a pure faith , undefiled by what is wrong with contemporary America-if only because its minister is quite likely to be telling all who will listen that the struggle for piety is as hard a fight among Christians as among Jews . There can be camaraderie in this battle , but there is no overwhelming evidence that it is more nearly won at one end of the street than at the other . " <P> Rabbi Hertzberg realizes that peaceful theological coexistence with the Jews-advocated by leading Christian theologians , including Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich-would be something of a revolution for traditionally proselytizing Christianity , but he thinks that practice in coexistence might be valuable . " Today , " he says , " Christianity is the religion of the West and primarily of whites . " But Eastern religions , once passive , are showing renewed vitality and missionary zeal .

Let us stand separately for our various truths . Let us stand together for the peace of society . Let us not do to one another that which is hateful to any of us . And let us await the judgment of God . "
