Nigger-Exploitation Slave Manufacturing Crookpany. 11.30 a.m . Interior of the operating theatre in the factory hospital . There is a writing desk and chair . One door leads outside , and the other to the doctor 's office . At the back are large low-built windows through which people outside the theatre can be seen . The windows happen to be open . As the curtain rises there is a low rumble of some distant noise . Enter two African male nurses , and , at the same time ( we see them through the windows ) outside the theatre , a chauffeur in an immaculate white driver 's coat , and an African worker , big and tall , the upper part of his body naked , wearing ragged trousers . As the two men speak , the male nurses dart here and there , obviously making ready for a casualty case . In the course of the dialogue a European doctor enters and goes into the office to change his clothes . CHAUFFEUR ( To himself . ) Tragic as it may be , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the men are touched and angry ; they feel , and are ready to act ! Calamity mothers movements ; strife fosters change ! I shall now organise the workers into a Union . ( To Mpulo . ) What things are these , comrade ? MPULO I rebel against this ! We all are revolted . See the workers on the move ! They come ! p. 3 CHAUFFEUR I am glad you all see it today ; rejoiced you feel . But we have had to pay a heavy cost for it . MPULO We will make the bosses pay ! CHAUFFEUR The worker speaks ! MPULO You have long preached Trade Unionism as our power and bulwark . Now we understand . There has been too much of this of late  --  dismissals , victimisation , accidents . CHAUFFEUR Yes , but do not let us act rashly . Unorganised , impulsive action would serve no useful purpose . We must be organised on proper lines to be a living force . Listen ! I will go now and address the night-shift workers who are free at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day , I will address you also . MPULO Do n't speak of the close of day ! It is here and now ! Do n't you see the workers ? They have come . Nothing will stop them ! Make way ! Make way for the workers ! ( The rumble of feet and the noise of voices . Perspiring , angry , protesting workers , dusty and in tatters , enter from the outside , and move about or peep through the windows . Among them are a few Indian workers . The Indian foreman appears and whispers to an Indian worker . ) FOREMAN ( Aside . ) Do n't be fools ! Leave the Natives alone ! We have better pay and working conditions . Tell the others to return to their work . It is not our business . In fact , it opens more chances for Indian men . p. 4 INDIAN MAN All right , I will tell them . We only came to see . ( The Indian foreman goes out . The Indian man goes round whispering to the few Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African workers by themselves . Enter in theatre two orderlies bearing a stretcher on which is a man covered with a blanket . The victim is placed on the table . ) VOICES Where is the damned doctor ? Ca n't he hurry ? A worker 's life means nothing to them . They think a worker has no value beyond factory value . They killed him by forcing him to work when he was not well . And he had done overtime the night before . And he had no money to consult an impartial doctor . The servile factory doctor said he should return to work . The manager ! The manager ! Where is he ? He thinks his work is to control and soften us , not to create a state of harmony and smooth contacts in the factory . ( The doctor appears and there is a hush as he goes to the victim . He hurries back to his office , obviously to get something . ) VOICES Let us storm the manager 's house and make a protest ! He would rather destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forward ! Wait ! Here comes the doctor again ! What a pity when one 's fate depends on a doctor ! ( Re-enter the doctor . He goes to the victim and , assisted by the male nurses , administers oxygen and injections . Suddenly he and the assistants look at each other , and a change comes over them . The doctor moves away slowly into his office , and as slowly the assistants cover the victim . The lights seem to fade down a shade or two . A pause. ) p. 5 VOICES He is dead ! ( There is a hush as the body is carried out . The doctor comes out of his office having changed his clothes . The manager rushes in . The doctor shrugs his shoulders and whispers something to the manager , and goes out . ) MANAGER Men , act like men . Be calm . Do not lose your heads or you might lose your jobs . Your action will gain you nothing . Accidents will occur . Return to your work . If you do n't there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , not for us ! MANAGER Who said that ? VOICES We ! MANAGER I must maintain law and order . The work and the machines must go on . THE VOICE You think of your pocket , profits and position only . MANAGER I know how you feel . But as your kindly father I would . . . . THE VOICE You are insolent ! Our fathers are black . No white man can father a black one no matter how he tries ! MANAGER ( Aside . ) The dirty swines ! ( Aloud . ) You will have yourselves to blame if trouble comes . We are masters here , and are determined to keep law and order . If you have any complaints and come and speak to us through the right channels and in a proper manner , we will listen . ( Hears sirens and noises of approaching cars . He changes his mood and becomes defiant . ) If you will not listen , fools , we shall break and mow you down like grass ! Ah ! Now you see for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 6 VOICES Look ! The police ! The police ! They have come ! They have been sent to force us back to work ! What must we do ? What say the men ? Hold your ground ! Do not be cowards ! Let 's wait and see ! Yes , it has come ! Let us meet it like men ! ( The manager has been looking on , first smiling to himself , then frowning , and then baffled . Enter the police both inside and outside the room . The workers sway but do not give way . The police outside try to drive them away . There is a scuffle which develops into an ugly fight . A police officer inside the room where there is no fight fires into space through the window . Some workers cry , They shoot ! They shoot ! Kill them ! The police leader and the manager find out that they have misjudged the temper of the men . The police fighting the men outside are too occupied and crammed to use their fire-arms . Trembling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phone for more police . They both rush to the phone and try to grab it  --  and the receiver tumbles down . Excitedly , the manager calls out , Quick ! Quick ! ) The Curtain Falls@@ Nigger-Exploitation Slave Manufacturing Crookpany. 2 p.m . Interior of the manager 's house  --  the lounge . Every sign of wealth and comfort . The manager is busy at his desk reading and preparing documents . His wife is knitting . Enter a girl servant , bringing in tea . MANAGER 'S WIFE Annie , hurry and call in the others to get their wages . Boss is very busy today and I will pay you . Come on , quick ! ANNIE Yes , missus . ( She goes out . Wife pours out the tea and gives a cup to her husband . Enter the Indian foreman , giving the customary greetings . ) MANAGER Naidoo , I want you to see that the Indian men have nothing to do with this trouble of the niggers . They are not your brothers . And it will be to your people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FOREMAN True , Master . I have tolded them . They knows . We stand by you . MANAGER Good . That is all I wanted to see you about . Try and find out who is stirring trouble . FOREMAN Yes , Master . I 'll try . ( He goes out . A moment later Annie comes in with the five other servants  --  three men and two women  --  including the chauffeur. ) p. 8 CHAUFFEUR ( Aside . ) There might be trouble about this morning 's happenings . I wonder if he noticed me . ( The wife pays the servants . ) MANAGER Listen here , all of you ! No one must go to the works , the compound or the workers ' village today , now or in the evening when you retire . Do you hear ! VOICES Yes , boss . MANAGER Your people are damn fools . They listen to agitators and bad men , and only cause trouble for themselves . I had a good mind to have them arrested . But I have given the poor devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you . Go . ( The servants go out . The chauffeur has been grave and has not spoken . ) MANAGER 'S WIFE Darling , it is after two . Do n't you think you should go and see if the boys have all returned to work ? MANAGER Why should I make the niggers feel important ? It would spoil them . I will go at the usual time . They must not be made to feel that we are shaky or disturbed . MANAGER 'S WIFE Will there be no trouble ? MANAGER I took precautions . The Induna and the police-boys , who are entirely loyal to us , are watching the situation closely , and will report developments . I have also instructed the police to stand by in case we need them . The workers themselves are not , of course , aware of this . They must not be made to feel important . The shooting down of four of them has had a salutary effect on the mob . p. 9 MANAGER 'S WIFE Oh , here is John . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife goes out . ) MANAGER Have all the boys gone back to work ? JOHN Yes , boss . Everything looks all right . MANAGER What was the talk like at lunch-time ? Did you and the police-boys keep a close watch to detect the ringleaders ? JOHN We did , Sir . There was no trouble . The men spoke little , ate , rested and went back to work  --  all except Mpulo . MANAGER Mpulo ! Why not ? Is he stirring up trouble ? Is he the ringleader ? What is the trouble ? Where is he now ? JOHN It is not in connection with this morning 's incident , boss . His only boy child is seriously ill , and . . . . MANAGER What the hell has the health of his child to do with us and this matter ? JOHN He says he must help his wife this afternoon for the boy may die at any moment now , boss . MANAGER Who cares about that ! How will his staying at home improve matters ? He is no doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we provide , free of charge , a doctor to look after our men and their families ? p. 10 JOHN We do , boss . MANAGER Well , damn me ! Go and ask the Company 's doctor to attend to the matter ! Why was this not done before ? JOHN Most of the workers do not go to the Company 's doctor . . . . MANAGER What do you mean ? JOHN They do not have real confidence in him because , they say , his primary duty and first considerations are not their health and well-being , but the interests of the Company . MANAGER The damn fools ! What do they know ! The doctor is a qualified scientist ! What do the ignorant dirty savages know about it ! The ungrateful things ! What do they say ! JOHN ( Innocently . ) They say his first and foremost object is to serve the Company , not to protect their health , unless that in turn serves the interests of the Company . They say he is not as careful and thorough as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say his relation to them is not that of doctor and patient , but that of boss and servant . MANAGER I will go crazy ! Who the hell teaches the boys such insolence and nonsense ? JOHN I do n't know , boss . MANAGER Look here ! I made you Induna here , did n't I ? p. 11 JOHN You did , Sir . MANAGER What for ? JOHN What for , Sir ? MANAGER To damn well take care of the bad boys , dangerous talk and agitators who spread poisonous ideas . And you come and tell me that you do n't know ! All you know is to get better pay and food  --  and to loaf . Now go back and tell Mpulo to go back to work at once . I 'll be going back to my office presently , and want to find him there . Do you get that ? JOHN Yes , Sir . MANAGER ( Almost hysterical . ) The machines must not stop or slow down even if men die out like flies . The machines must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mean the loss of hundreds of pounds . It would mean a pause in life . This must not happen even if we lose scores of men . The machines must be saved and must go on . The machine , not Man , is the thing . It takes long to build machines ; men are produced daily in hundreds . Machines can be made in select , expensive , specially constructed factories only ; men are easily produced every and anywhere  --  in slums , streets and gutters . Skill , labour and money make machines ; men are begotten in ease and playfulness . Any savage , harlot or lunatic can produce men , but it takes scores of highly trained , gifted , hard-working investors , technicians and engineers to create and nurse machines . Machines are rare and costly ; men , cheap and common . People will gladly give away their daughters and patriotically sacrifice their sons , husbands , wives and sweethearts , but never machines ! ' T is machines that bring wealth , power , progress and happiness . Civilisation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul and dignity of Man , but we know machines have a soul , a living dynamic soul . Men are tools , brawn and dust ; machines are money , brains and life . Talk of men and machines ! Why , there is absolutely no comparison ! ( He is choked , and coughs . But he appears surprised and highly pleased with what he considers his newly-discovered powers of oratory . The phone rings. ) p. 12 MANAGER Well , out with you ! And do what I have told you ! JOHN Yes , boss . ( Goes out . ) MANAGER Mr Humphreys 's place . . . speaking . . . . No . Everything is okay . . . . Yes . . . . The damn niggers need firm , even harsh treatment . Treat them well  --  and you spoil them . . . . Thank you officer . . . . Not now definitely , but keep your men ready , and leave two about my house . . . . It will be all right . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with them for nothing all these years . . . . Thanks . Goodbye . ( Enter his wife . ) MANAGER 'S WIFE Is everything all right , dear ? MANAGER Of course . Do not worry . That was the police officer on the phone . ( Enter the servant , Tom . ) MANAGER I wanted to see you . Where is Henry ? TOM Just outside , boss . MANAGER Call him . Do n't go . Call . TOM Henry ! Henry ! The boss wants you . MANAGER Tell him to hurry up ! ( Enter the chauffeur . ) I have changed my mind . I want you two to go to the compound and the village tonight , especially at the mess and beerhall . Listen carefully to what the men say , and come and report . p. 13 CHAUFFEUR What does the manager mean ? MANAGER D-did I hear . . . . W-what d-do you say ! CHAUFFEUR I will not spy on my people . ( To Tom who nudges and tries to restrain him . ) Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You bloody , dirty , damn dog ! CHAUFFEUR ( Calm . ) I do not like people to swear at me . In fact I wo n't have it ! ( From now on his wife works hard to stop the manager fighting the chauffeur . At the same time Tom nervously and helplessly tries to restrain Henry . ) MANAGER The cur ! I will choke ! MANAGER 'S WIFE Spoiled boy ! You think you are white because you drive ! CHAUFFEUR What is there in the childish drudgery of driving to make one think at all ? ( To Tom . ) Leave me alone , you ! MANAGER I will blow you to pieces if you say one word more ! CHAUFFEUR Let me go , then . MANAGER Stand where you are ! I will break your neck if you move ! p. 14 CHAUFFEUR ( Moving . ) I resign . Give me my passes . ( He stops . ) TOM Do n't friend . This is trouble . CHAUFFEUR You are no friend of mine . You are the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And shut up you cheeky boy . We will call the police ! Take him away , Tom . CHAUFFEUR Try and do it ! I said give me my passes and I will go away . But do not mess about with them , and say I am bad . I know the pass is the dirtiest instrument for controlling , vilifying and persecuting the African . MANAGER 'S WIFE You wo n't have your passes unless you obey ! MANAGER Let him have them ! I will kill him ! MANAGER 'S WIFE Tom , go and call the police . CHAUFFEUR Stay where you are ! ( Tom shivers but does not move . ) And now that I am going I want the white man to know that for all the evil and injustice he is committing against my people , I hate him ! . . . No ! It is the system and its evils ! The Curtain Falls@@ Nigger-Exploitation Slave Manufacturing Crookpany. 2.20 p.m . Interior of Mpulo 's home at the workers ' village . Every sign of abject poverty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only family bed , is a set of boards joined together and pitched on wooden cases . There is a table of cheap material , evidently constructed by Mpulo himself . One old chair ; and three small wooden cases that also serve as chairs . The ceiling is done with sack pieces , obviously to keep away the heat and the cold of the corrugated iron roof which is visible through one or two gaps in the sacking ceiling . One corner of the selfsame room serves as the kitchen . Newspaper wallpaper . Small islands of old linoleum and grass mats , here and there . Inside are Mpulo , his wife , two old women , the sick boy and Mpulo 's two small girls eating hard porridge and washing it down with cold sugared water ( which they prepare before the audience ) . It is a dreary scene , and except for the silent movements of the two girls eating , it is still and gloomy as a grave . After a moment , there is a knock at the door . MPULO Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace on you all . REST Mmmmmmmmm ! p. 16 WOMAN How is it today  --  the child ? 1ST OLD WOMAN My children still live in pain . There is no improvement . WOMAN There is God . He knows . He will pity and aid His children . 2ND OLD WOMAN So be it ! So be it ! 1ST OLD WOMAN It is so bad that my son here has not gone back to work . 2ND OLD WOMAN Why should he go and await the death of his son and heir at work ? WOMAN Do not speak as if death must come . As for going to work , are we not the slaves of these callous people ? 1ST OLD WOMAN Slaves ! We are the Seed of kings and conquerors , of bards and braves . We are only passing through the valley of the shadow of transition . 2ND OLD WOMAN You are true . Slaves do not wait , pause over and meditate on death ; they expect , woo and welcome it . To the slave death is an expected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mysterious . Unlike slaves , we are touched deeply by death , and ponder solemnly and long over its meaning and results . No , we are not slaves in spirit and mind although we are under foreign rule and economic slavery . MPULO 'S WIFE If we had money it could not have happened . We knew it was coming , but could not stop it . We could have gone to a private doctor earlier . ( Knock at the door. ) p. 17 MPULO Come in . ( Enter the Induna . ) JOHN I offer my respects . ( The two children go out . ) MPULO I knew you would be coming  --  sent by that dog of a hateful manager . JOHN You say you knew ? How ? MPULO Our methods of communication are speedier than your white man 's . JOHN I did not know my people could be so . . . .

MPULO 'S WIFE Speak not thus , father of Sigubu . JOHN Yes , tell him not to speak thus when a cloud hangs over the house , and where his security is involved . 1ST OLD WOMAN ( Aside to Second Old Woman . ) He speaks as if he poisoned the child and would like to have the father dismissed . 2ND OLD WOMAN Who knows ? You do not know what men can do to protect their position and power . p. 18 MPULO I say I knew you were coming , and you would have been met by sticks and even an assagai but for great Mkabela 's wise and restraining words . Yes , Mkabela , the leader and the defender of the oppressed . How oft has he not told us in strong , fiery words of what has now come to pass ! We were blind and deaf . At last we  --  at last I  --  see and hear . I speak freely because I know he is now beyond victimisation . I speak freely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bypass it . JOHN I think it best you see me alone , outside , so that I may tell you what I have come to tell you . MPULO A sufferer has no secrets . Speak . JOHN The white man raves and will not reason . MPULO Who wants him to reason and listen ? We want him to rave and remain blind and insane . It is our great chance . JOHN I mean he wants you to return to work immediately . MPULO After all these years , the sacrifice , the faithful service ! 2ND OLD WOMAN Hear and see the white man and his ways ! 1ST OLD WOMAN Their ways are not ours . They count their days in hours . The immediate blinds them to the ultimate . p. 19 JOHN Kinsmen , it is not I. It is the white man . I say and feel as you do , but , poor worker as I am , what can I do ? MPULO Much if you know ; more if you will . As for me , from now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the sake of the National Cause , I will stand for truth and freedom , and defy the white man even if it costs me the loss of a thousand jobs , crushing poverty and jail . I offer myself freely and unflinchingly as part of the great sacrifice for our liberty . I say part , because many more must be sacrificed before we can succeed . 2ND OLD WOMAN Love , death and things eternal , remain such in lowly as in high places  --  and here we see the love of parents and the shadow of death wrestling desperately . Why does the white man try to insult and fight against these changeless and universal things because they appear in lowly places and among the black people ? JOHN I say so too , but what can I do ? I can not help it . MPULO What can you do ; you can not help it ! O weak fool but strong tool of the white man ! What can not you do ? Why ca n't you help it ? You can do much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what is the use of your Ndunaship if it is of no use now ! Now , if ever , you should be Nduna of the situation ! Do I ask you to wreck your position , to fight against the authorities , to be a fool and act rashly ? No . I ask you , instead , not to sell your people and their heritage and manhood to the white man ; to stand up for truth and harmony , for fair play and sanity . I ask you to be what a Nduna should be  --  the wise and impartial mediator between employer and employee . Do not use the misery , helplessness , ignorance and the very traditions of your people to enhance your personal position or to secure prestige and gain . Lead them from their side , not from the white man 's side . Lead them aright and faithfully , not according to their ignorance , weakness and prejudices . But I know you  --  too well I know such as you who will sacrifice kingdoms and souls and principles and truth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prestige , name and publicity ! Go and tell your white boss that I am not coming . Let him dismiss me if he cares . And if you care for your own safety do not bring me more messages from him . p. 20 2ND OLD WOMAN Do not speak thus when so august a visitor is among us . I mean the shadow of death . 1ST OLD WOMAN She is right , son . Cleanse your feelings in the solemnity and solitude of affliction . Soften . Belch . MPULO You do not mean that I should return to work ? 2ND OLD WOMAN We say so . To surrender in adversity is not cowardice ; it is not defeat . It is to give oneself the hope to strike again . MPULO That would be weakness and shame . 1ST OLD WOMAN It would n't , son . We women have learnt to be great in our littleness , to be powerful in powerlessness . By surrendering herself wholly to the man she loves , a woman conquers and rules him . But when and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whenever a woman revenges against a man or cheats him , Life is wrenched from its course with disaster to more than the couple concerned . Victorious surrenders occur daily . Accept it , my son . MPULO But there is no love in this connection . I detest these people . 2ND OLD WOMAN The greater will be the victory . We must serve and suffer pain to conquer . THE WOMAN Prayer will do it . It ever does . ( She immediately sinks down and prays , the prayer punctuated with Amens and murmurs from the others . A hymn is sung . After this there is a pause . Suddenly Mpulo 's wife bursts out wailing . The other women try to pacify her. ) p. 21 THE WOMAN The child sleeps . You will wake him up . He needs the rest prayer has given him . 2ND OLD WOMAN Did he fall asleep because we prayed ? THE WOMEN What does Ma-Dhlamini mean ? Do n't you know the power of prayer ? And why does Ma-Cele weep so ? MPULO 'S WIFE So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MPULO The Induna came ; the women offered prayer . MPULO 'S WIFE They said prayer does all , and that we should trust in God . MPULO And it was said that I should control myself and not blame the white people for the low wages they give us . MPULO 'S WIFE And you went out and left me alone with the women . MPULO I did so reluctantly although I was told repeatedly that my presence would not help the sick . For who knows what spiritual and supernatural connection there might be between soul and soul ? MPULO 'S WIFE When you had gone a few other women came in silently and groaned . The child began to cry continuously . I wept . It was soon over . JOHN Why do you speak words like these in times like these ? p. 22 THE WOMAN That is true . Fight against the desire to speak of ill omens and dark things . Let Mpulo return to work . MPULO I go .

It is not he , but affliction speaking . JOHN I know . Pain is universal , and I have known it . 2ND OLD WOMAN Pain is universal , but its causes , results and meaning differ widely and profoundly . ( The Induna goes out . A slight pause . Enter a few women silently and seat themselves on the ground . They groan . Suddenly the child cries piteously . The mother carries her arms over her head , and wails out loud . ) MPULO 'S WIFE It has come ! It has come ! The same ! The same ! Where is God ; where the power of prayer ?

The child has stopped crying . ) MPULO 'S WIFE Why is the child still ? Why does it not cry ? Let it wail out loud and live ! Let it kick and move violently and even painfully as it did in my womb , for that is life ! It lives if it cries ; it cries if it lives ! Silence and peace are death . Let it cry in pain , not rest in death . Will no one hear ? Can you not move ? Speak and tell me . Is he dead ? ( The other women huddle close together as if afraid . Only the two old women are calm . They have quietly covered the dead child 's face , and are now kneeling in silent prayer .

The Curtain Falls@@ Nigger-Exploitation Slave Manufacturing Crookpany. 3.20 p.m . Interior of the main section of the works . Ground Floor . In front from left to right is a cocopan track which runs , at the extreme left , into a low tunnel . Cocopans move up and down . Next to the tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . At the extreme back there is a huge dump of sulphur or pyrites from which come clouds of dust . In the centre there is a ladder-like flight of steps leading to the first floor . On the right are two great tanks containing steaming acid preparations . First Floor . This we can see easily as it is not far above the ground floor . On the left , directly above the boiler on the ground floor , is a wheel-like mechanism running flat on its axle . On the right the edge of the first floor is level with the mouths of the steaming tanks . At the back , centre , are piles of dusty bags . Although the place is lit , it is dark , dusty and weird because of the dust from the dumps and the bags . There is noise , so that the men have almost to shout in addressing each other . Half-naked men  --  straining , perspiring forms  --  are working at high speed at various points around the place , pushing cocopans , carrying things up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boiler , the tanks , etc . Now and again instructions , friendly quips or snatches of conversation are hurled across the floors . Once or twice the men , looking this way and that , whisper earnestly and excitedly to each other , making wild gestures  --  no doubt discussing the day 's fateful happenings . It is upon this scene the curtain opens . The scene is so full of action , drama and pep that for some moments it is the centre of the story before the characters speak . A team of men lift up and carry from one side of the works to the other a heavy case , and as they do so , sing a stirring song . They scatter back to their individual or group jobs . 1ST MAN Why do we sing , what can we sing  --  such as we ? p. 30 2ND MAN ' T is not song we sing but our thoughts and hours ; ' t is not music but the flood of emotions and our heated blood . 3RD MAN All great things , painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are true . Music is in everything that is round , deep and full . And what is deeper than pain , strife and sorrow ? 3RD MAN Men will sing dying , sing even to die . Just as there is life in song and song in life , there is also song in death and death in song ! ( A shovelling group breaks into another moving song . Enter Mpulo . He hesitates slightly , and then goes forward to his post with resolution . The men have noticed him at once , and faster than sound , the human spark has been kindled and flashed round to every worker . The singers , like the others , stop and stare at him for a moment . No one speaks or murmurs or moves . Suddenly , as if at a given signal , the men resume work in death-like silence  --  except for the hum , grind and clatter of the machines and tools . Mpulo is visibly torn by emotion , and he rather wrestles with than does his work . Enter the manager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Induna . ) Quick ! Call the men to attention . The big bosses would like to speak to them . ( The workers have taken in the situation at once , and work like controlled but pent-up robots . They do not cast even a glance at the newcomers. ) p. 31 JOHN Listen , men ! Stop work . The bosses want to speak to you . ( Noise of shouting and singing from outside . Both the workers and the bosses exchange glances among themselves . The manager trembles either with fear or anger . ) MANAGER John ! What 's that ? Who are those ? What 's happening ? Go and find out , you fool ! ( One of the directors whispers to him . ) MANAGER All right . Come back ! We 'll wait and see . ( Enter the company of night-shift workers led by the chauffeur . They carry weapons . Singing stops . ) MANAGER What does this mean , boys ? ( To chauffeur . ) You dirty agitator ! You will regret . You were fired this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police . ) He is the cause of the trouble ! He spoils the boys ! Officer , arrest him ! CHAUFFEUR I 've come to tell my friend Mpulo that his child is dead . ( At this intelligence , and as the manager speaks hysterically , a wave-like murmur of sympathy and of anger and defiance sweeps the workers , and before the officer who has stepped forward to arrest the chauffeur does so , Mpulo , grim and fierce as poverty and disgrace , moves forward slowly but with determination  --  and speaks ) p. 32 MPULO Leave him alone ! OFFICER My orders are to arrest him ! MANAGER Yes , do ! A DIRECTOR Wait ! MPULO I said leave him alone ! MANAGER John , stop him ! JOHN ( Not moving . ) Yes , boss ! MPULO ( Now next to chauffeur . ) Touch us  --  and you touch death ! OFFICER Do n't try and start trouble . I have many men outside ready to shoot if you do . I will call them in . ( He draws out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Your guns , men  --  and cover the rest . ( To the workers . ) Move who dares ! I will call for help . ( The workers now covered , he blows the whistle , but before he knows it , Mpulo and the chauffeur have grabbed and floored him . The rest of the workers fall upon the police and the directors . Shouts , curses and revolver reports . Enter more police . A death struggle . Men drop down while others are crushed against , burnt up or eaten by the machines , and yet others are thrown into the acid tanks . Suddenly , Mpulo 's voice rises above the general din and clatter. ) p. 33 MPULO The power shed ! The power room ! Quick ! ( A moment later the whole scene is plunged into utter darkness . The noise of human cries , of the blows exchanged and of the grind of the machines continues . Then comes a deafening explosion . The rumble gradually wears down to comparative silence . A slight pause . The stage gradually becomes dimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris with human bodies showing here and there . The dim light is the light of flames as the place has caught fire . From one side of the stage there is a stir and a break-through , and a figure staggers up and struggles forward towards the centre . It is the chauffeur . ) CHAUFFEUR Death as brave Mpulo said has come to this place today . The workers have perished , fighting . It is a tragic victory ! Ah ! My wounds ! ( Twists and winces . Rubs his eyes , and seems to search for a lost object . ) CHAUFFEUR No ! No ! It can not be he ! But it is . ( Coming forward slowly and in pain , but with eagerness . ) Up comrade ! Rise up , Mpulo , my brother ! You live ! You can not die ! Rise up and speak to me ! ( He has been removing debris from Mpulo 's body , and having extricated the body , tries to shake or drag it into activity . But Mpulo is dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me die instead ! He was the greatest . . . . ( There is a loud crack , and from the upper floor comes thick dust and weird , indescribable objects that bury the two figures and plunge the stage into darkness again . ) ( Curtain )
