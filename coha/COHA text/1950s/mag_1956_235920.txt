The 84th Congress , in its second session , was an unwanted political child . It was born last January amid dire predictions that it would grow up as a ne'er-do-well in the broken election-year home of party-style Democracy and Republicanism . But it adjourned last week with surprisingly good grades in conduct . <P> Far into the night the House of Representatives shook with spirited , if unmelodious , yodels of Aloha Oe and the Whiffenpoof Song . From Dwight Eisenhower came a final message conveying " my best wishes to Mr. Sam . " Said Speaker Sam Rayburn of the Texas-born President : " I long ago told him that he was my most distinguished constituent . " On the Senate side , Ohio Republican George Bender was in mid-sentence when Florida Democrat Spessard Holland reminded the Senate that it was time to adjourn . Responded Vice President Richard Nixon : " The point of order is well taken . " He banged down his gavel and the members of the 84th Congress scattered to take up their cam paign cudgels . <P> Two That Stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCormack , was " one of the most constructive Congresses in history . " Re publican Leader Joe Martin was less ex travagant , but conceded : " It has been a hard-working Congress . It has enacted many meritorious measures , but it has failed to come to grips with many others . " Whenever the 84th got too blatantly political , it was slapped ba-k . The Presi dent made his veto stick on the **29;15016;TOOLONG natural gas bill , al though he was " in accord with its basic objectives , " because he got a strong whiff of " arrogant " lobbying ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . <P> He vetoed the Democrats ' boondoggling 90%-of-parity farm bill while farm-state Republicans shuddered , then won passage of a soil-bank farm bill more to his liking . A belated Administration drive to put through a moderate civil-rights bill died virtually unmourned by either party in the Senate last week . Killed earlier because of its involvement with the civil-rights issue : the school-construction bill , primarily because Manhattan 's Democratic Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr . had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 16 ) . <P> Two to Remember . On foreign aid , the 84th was unconvinced and unconvincing : last week it authorized the spending of $4 billion , some $900 million less than the Administration had originally thought necessary . On domestic legislation , the Congress was sometimes more generous than the Administration thought wise : it expanded the 21-year-old Social Security program , added disability benefits at the age of 50 , forced on the Defense Department more money ( $900 million ) than it wanted for the Air Force . The two bills for which the 84th will be longest remembered : the $33 billion highway construction program , biggest public works project in U.S. history , and the dam project to bring vital power and water to the hungry , thirsty Upper Colorado River Basin . <P> In all , the amiable , easygoing 84th Congress enacted more than 800 public laws-many of them minor , but in their sum total making a record that both Democrats and Republicans would find useful during the coming campaign .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
