txt The two-day-old maritime strike that threatened to paralyze a major part of the American merchant marine ended ) early yesterday . After all-night bargaining at the Edison Hotel on West Forty-seventh Street , forty steamship lines signed an agreement with two officer unions . They were the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association and the American Radio Association , both C. I. 0 . Signing of the understanding released five passenger ships that had been threatened with a protracted tie-up in the Port of New York . Smaller liners and perhaps twoscore freighters strikebound in Atlantic and Gulf ports also were scratched from the strike lists , and cargo loading will get under way fast tomorrow morning to make up for lost time . In New York alone more than 1,400 passengers bound for Europe or Southern waters had faced the prospect of no transportation . The ships that sailed yesterday included the American Export liner Independence . She got away shortly after noon , which was her scheduled sailing time . United States Government shipping commissioners were on hand to sign on the ship 's crew . including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled with the employer group a day earlier . There was gaiety and relief on the faces of the passengers . They had spent an anxious two days wondering if their ship would go . Among the ships that left port yesterday was the American Export liner Excalibur , bound for Mediterranean ports , as was the Independence . The Excalibur 's 115 passengers had boarded their ship in Jersey City Friday , and remained on ' Ward overnight . ' ' The other passenger ships Tare the Grace liners Santa ' 8psa , Santa Clara and Santa Liulsa , all headed for southern %raters . ' Signing of the new agreement ja1 ; ings to this important segment of the shipping industry of the country a three-year conftact for the first time . There fere indications that both sides fn'kesaw a sustained period of 149r peace ahead . i ? : The engineers and radio men =aon substantial improvements in their pension and welfare sysMm , which was the crux of de , ri-rands they had made on the operators . In the past the emplbyers have contributed 75 ngnts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was Wit enough money for a retirement project , long sought by the Miter groups . ? yesterday the Committee of Itlantic and Gulf Steamship trines , the el-ployer bargaining Oft heajed by Francis T. Greene , granted the unions an gferease of 85 cents a day in this plan , bringing the total to About 2,600 engineers and radio officers will come under the plan , according to figures made available by the American Merchant Marine Institute , the official trade association in the industry . Mr. Greene is president this group .  - -  -  , The agreement signed yesterday left only one section of the ( merchant marine still in doubt about future operations . A group of tanker companies operating 220 petroleum carriers in deepsea trades had broken off talks on Friday afternoon with the National Maritime Union , on the , issue of unemployment security benefits . . The unemployment plan , not , an issue in the officer negotia- , tions , had been a major victory l in the outcome of talks of the N. M. U. and the Greene committee . The N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of the union of unlicensed seamen , walked out of the Roosevelt Hotel . He had ' been meeting there with tanker operators headed by Walter E. Maloney , an attorney and former president of the Merchant Marine Institute . No new talks with the tanker operators have been scheduled . The Maloney group must first bargain with the Curran union , which traditionally leads the way in the seaman talks , and then with the two officer unions and with a third officer group , the International Organization of Masters , Mates and Pilots of America , an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor . The masters and mates union . incidentally , had been attending the all-night sessions of the brother officer unions , in an observer capacity . It was reliably reported after the signing that this union had promised to give consideration to the formula won by the engineers and the radio men . It was considered likely that the masters and mates would accept the new agreement as the basis for their new contract . The mates ' contract has always expired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this year they will move the termination date up to June . Then all the sea union contracts ' on this coast could be negotiated at the same time . With unions posing their separate crises at different times of the year , the companies suffer , from the effects of a whipsaw treatment ? and the merging of sea . negotiations Ls considered a primary goal in some parts of the industry . Another observer at the session ? that ended yesterday morning was Capt . Hewlett R. Bishop , Atlantic Coast director of the Maritime Administration . It was the first time in the history of New York 's turbulent labor management relations that an official of the Federal shipping Agency had sat through all such talks . There was special significance this year in Captain Bishop 's presence . The operators were in a sense between the miltstones of union pressure and Congressional cynicism . Congress has been talking much lately of continually mounting operating subsidies for the merchant marine . The largest item in the subsidy goes for wages , to offset the disadvantage the American operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee is tudying labor-management relations in the industry , And Representative Herbert C. Bonner , chairman , has expressed-interest in a ceiling , on ? subsidized wages . Moreover , he has questioned ' industry leaders on the subject , and plans further inquiries , The newest contract in the industry was not completely a union victory , The engineers and radio men , for instance , agreed that there would be no more than two wage reopenings , and that the first would come no sooner than June 15 , 1956 . The pension and welfare plan and the vacation plan were extended for five years . The unions had sought to deuble their annual vacation times of 30 days , but dropped this point . There is to be no reopening . on the question of payments into the welfare fund ' during the three years . One signal employer , achievement was a new clause in which the unions agreed to give up some ' of the costly fringe benefits , which they ( like the unlicensed seamen ) had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it instead of the current forty hours .
