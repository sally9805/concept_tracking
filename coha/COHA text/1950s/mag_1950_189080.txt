POLICIES &; PRINCIPLES <P> The most important Briton east of Dover , as his own countrymen say , is Malcolm MacDonald , His Majesty 's Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia . <P> For over three years , the kinetic son of Britain 's first Socialist Prime Minister , Ramsay MacDonald , has been trying to keep the disparate , restive , unprepared peoples of Southeast Asia within the free world . He is the other " Mac " of democracy in the Far East . He and Douglas MacArthur are the terminal anchors of a defense that loops around an aggressive Red subcontinent for some 52,000 miles , from Japan to Burma . <P> A blue flag , bearing the British crown and the legend " Southeast Asia , " flies above MacDonald 's Malaya headquarters , just across the water from the island fortress of Singapore . Fanning out to the north lie Malaya , Indo-China , Siam and Burma , rich in tin , rubber and rice , overland corridors to India and the Indies , peopled by 68 million . MacDonald 's flag expresses a hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the West for a new , freer regionalism . As he labors , MacDonald has an eye on history 's clock . Will there be time to mold a strong Southeast Asia before Communism moves in ? <P> Evolutionary Revolutionist . MacDonald , now a youthful-looking 48 , came up through Oxford and the Labor benches of Parliament , served as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs , Secretary of State for Colonies and High Commissioner in Canada before arriving in Southeast Asia . A self-styled " evolutionary socialist , " he hit the pukka sahibs of Malaya and its environs like a revolutionary sans-culotte . <P> An unpretentious extravert with an unaffected sense of social and racial equality , MacDonald refused to visit stuffy colonial clubs that drew a bar against Asiatics . To his dinner table he invited as many brown and yellow guests as white . All this sprang from a basic conviction . " In the last 20 years , " he said , " British policy here has moved in the right political direction-towards local self-government . It is not our political but our social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asiatic countries . " <P> In the process of correcting past mistakes , MacDonald opened his door to all callers regardless of color . At his residence , " Bukit Serene , " a grey and yellow stone mansion built before the war as a love nest for the local sultan , the interviews and conferences are all but endless . The Commissioner wants to see everyone . He is relaxed and informal , likes to smoke a long cheroot , wear slacks and yellow sport shirt . When three loinclothed Dyak penghulus ( chiefs ) from Sarawak dropped in last fall , MacDonald tactfully donned kilts to greet them . Later he took them on their first airplane ride , their first train ride and their first taste of Singapore night life . <P> The Commissioner spends much of his time afield . On regular rounds , often flying in a tiny Auster , MacDonald meets the peoples he is trying to knit into a cohesive unit . He discusses the rice crop or the damage done to plantings by wild pigs . He samples local food , shelter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aboriginal audience with some impromptu Scottish reels .
