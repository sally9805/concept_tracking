Some Like It Hot ( Mirisch ; United Artists ) , Marilyn Monroe 's first picture in nearly two years , is a double-barreled period piece : it not only parodies the freewheeling , gangster-ridden ' 20s , but it recalls the pie-throwing farce of cinema 's infant days . <P> Good old-fashioned pratfall that it is , it was not turned out without heartaches and headaches for Writer-Director-Producer Billy Wilder . It was made last fall , when Actress Monroe , believing herself pregnant , was reportedly more sulkily temperamental than usual , with Playwright-Husband Arthur Miller hovering solicitously on the edge of the set during much of the shooting . What 's more , Wilder took the fairly daring risk of turning two of Hollywood 's most popular leading men ( Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon ) into female impersonators . <P> Curtis and Lemmon are a couple of musicians in a Chicago speakeasy . When the club is raided and they are suddenly out of a job , they arrive at a garage to borrow a friend 's car just in time to witness a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1929 . With Curtis and Lemmon cowering in a corner , Mobster George Raft and his henchmen line seven men against the wall and machine-gun them dead . <P> To escape sure death as witnesses to the slaughter , Curtis and Lemmon leap into garter belts and padded bras , join an all-female orchestra heading for Florida . The band 's singer : Actress Monroe . For the rest of the movie , Curtis and Lemmon are rarely out of their dresses , <P> Marilyn is rarely in hers . Clad in negligee and open mouth , she crawls into Lemmon 's upper berth to thank " her " for a favor , notices with innocent surprise : " You poor thing , you 're trembling all over . " <P> In Florida , Lemmon 's bewigged and beaded feminine charms catch the eye of a much-married millionaire ( Joe E. Brown ) . Curtis meanwhile finds time to forsake female impersonation long enough to quick-change into yachting cap and blazer , and woo Marilyn with a fairly good impersonation of Cary Grant . At the end , boy wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsied Lemmon . <P> Lipsticked , mascaraed and tilting at a precarious angle ( " How do they walk in these things ? " ) , Actor Lemmon digs out most of the laughs in the script . As for Marilyn , she 's been trimmer , slimmer and sexier in earlier pictures . <P> Lonelyhearts ( Dore Schary ; United Artists ) . In the early years of the Depression , a young man named Nathan Weinstein , the manager of a small hotel in Manhattan , suffered a strange and horrible schizo-religious vision . Set down in a slim volume called Miss Lonelyhearts , published in 1933 under the pen name of Nathanael West , his experience was acclaimed as a masterpiece of the peculiar literature of phantasmagoria-a vision of hell on earth , a scream of anguish at the meaninglessness of human suffering .
