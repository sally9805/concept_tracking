txt The Transit Authority is exploring the possibility of operating trains without motormen or conductors . throughout the rapid transit system . As a pilot- automation project , the agency is considering converting the Times SquareGrand Central shuttle service to remote control operations . If this is done and it proves successful , the rest of the system will be changed to automation gradually . The authority 's thinking- was disclosed yesterday by Charles L. Patterson , chairman , at the thirtieth annual luncheon of the Downtown Brooklyn Association . The luncheon , held at the Towers Hotel in . Brooklyn , was attended by 500 persons . Mr. Patterson discussed the automation study and other transit matters in connection I with the possibility of a fare change . He told the gathering that he was unprepared " right now " to say ' whether the 15-cent fare would be increased this year . " The automated shuttle the engineers are now studying would use existing cars , tracks and platforms with some comparatively minor modifications , " Mr. Patterson said . " The entire operation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cars , on the platforms and on the tracks . The trains would be dispatched by an automatic mechanism into which the desired schedule would be fed . " Door openings and closings , ' starting , running , stopping . time in station  --  the entire cycle // The New York Times MAY USE AUTOMATION : Charles L. Patterson , Transit Authority chairman , speaking at luncheon of the Downtown Brooklyn Association . He discussed operating subways without motormen or conductors . SUBWAY MAY TEST SELF-RUN TRAINS // of the shuttle operation would take place automatically with no one on the train if we so desired it . " A demonstration of the practicability of such an operation was conducted Dec. 1 , 1955 , by the Union Switch and Signal Division of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company on the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad . One of the New Haven 's , multiple-unit cars was sent east and west , coasted or stopped in the New Rochelle-to-Rye territory from a remote control panel at Larchmont , N.Y . The demonstrators said there was no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or electric locomotive with a full complement of cars . Mr. Patterson said that with the approval of the Board of Estimate  --  which would have to pass on capital improvements ? conversion of the shuttle to crewless operations could be accomplished in less than a year at a cost of about $1,000,000 . He compared the changeover to " turning an automatic elevator on its side and running it horizontally , since in the shuttle we have only one train on a track with a station at each end . " He said he had been told by engineers that " it 's a simpler problem than an automatic elevator that has to stop at every ' floor on signals from within and outside the car . " As to extending automation to main-line operation , the authority chairman conceded that it would be " a little more difficult and costly . " He said engineers had told him the difficulties would not be " insurmountable " but would require more complex equipment and take longer to solve . In presenting his concepts of subway automation , Mr. Patterson traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity and lightened labor by the substitution of machines for men . He recalled the two-man operations at stations  --  one to sell tickets , the other to collect and destroy them . Years ago on elevated lines , he also recalled , a conductor was needed to open the gates at the ends of each pair of cars and pass along a bell signal to the motorman . Trains then proceded on written orders from a dispatcher under a system of telegraphic communications . The authority chairman described present operations , controlled by automatic block signalling , remote control switches for setting up train routes , . trippers to stop a train that had run past a red signal light and automatic devices that regulate the speed of trains . Later . at a press conference , he said ' that complete automation of the 725 miles of running tracks would mean elimination . of 90 per cent of the 3,100 motormen and 75 per cent CD the conductors and conductorplatform men . An indication of the payroll savings was supplied by Joseph E. O'Grady , another authority member . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would mean a reduction of about twenty-five motormen and conductors with an annual savings of $150,000 . The authority members said their own engineers , together with engineers from Union Switch and Signal , the General Railway Signal Company , General Electric and Western Electric , were working on the problems . The study has been going on for a year , it was explained . Mr. Patterson and Mr. 10'Grady mentioned other lines that would receive early consideration if the Grand CentralTimes Square automated shuttle proved successful . These are the Franklin Avenue shuttle in Brooklyn , between the Franklin Avenue station of the IND subway and the Prospect Park station of the BMT subway ; the ( Myrtle Avenue line , which runs from Jay Street , Brooklyn , to Metropolitan Avenue , Queens : the Fourteenth Street-Canarsie line , and the Flushing line of the IRT . The Times Square-Grand Cgntral shuttle line makes 366 round trips a day and carries 120,000 passengers . The entire subway system carries 4,500,000 passengers a day , using 486 stations on the IRT , BMT and IND subways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel periods . Mr. Patterson , in discussing possible savings , said he felt the city should assume the $6,500 , - 000 annual payroll of the authority 's 906-member police force .
