There is no Texan like a Texan born some place else . Texans think this quip perfectly tailored for Amarillo Publisher Gene Howe , who has become the voice of the vast Texas Panhandle by outshouting the natives and trying to forget that he was born in Kansas . In both his Amarillo Globe and News , his garrulous daily column , " The Tactless Texan , " is the fountainhead of authentic Panhandle lore . <P> " Old Tack 's " reverence for Texas is fanatical and often funny . Panhandle women , he wrote , have the world 's prettiest legs , made strong and muscular by leaning against the fierce Panhandle winds . Panhandle dogs are tougher ; Panhandle skunks are twice as odorous . Even in the dust-bowl days he bragged that no other place could produce such suffocating dust clouds . According to legend , the Northwest Texas Hospital took Tack 's tall boastings so seriously that it ordered beds a foot longer than normal to accommodate Panhandle patients . <P> Last week , at 64 , Gene Howe was rounding out 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Globe and News 's new million-dollar plant . Above the main entrance was his one-line journalistic creed : " A newspaper may be forgiven for lack of wisdom but never for lack of courage . " <P> The two-story building itself made plain that while Old Tack had rattled out his folksy nonsense , Publisher Howe had become a no-nonsense businessman . He had built up a string of eleven newspapers and a radio chain reaching to the West Coast . Later , he trimmed to an easily manageable five papers ( at Amarillo and Lubbock , Texas ; Atchison Kans. ) , two radio stations , and a deposit box full of blue-chip stocks . <P> Gene Howe had been bent on such Lone Star independence ever since he fled from the towering reputation of his famous publishing father , Old Ed Howe , Kansas ' " Sage of Potato Hill . " When Gene was 15 , sharp-penned Old Ed wrote : " Three Atchison young men disgraced themselves . . . Saturday . The publisher 's son was the drunkest of the bunch . " Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came back and soon took over the Atchison Globe . <P> Eleven years later , Gene bolted for Amarillo and started his own paper . He gave his editors free rein , spent most of his time making Old Tack the independent character Gene Howe wanted to be . In his battered Stetsons , his rumpled-and expensive-suits , he soon mastered the look of Texas , then acquired the substance by buying a 15,000-acre cattle ranch and a herd of Herefords . But it was not until Texas mothers and fathers began naming their children " Gene Howe " and cowhands took to calling their ponies Old Tack that he knew , for sure , he had arrived .
