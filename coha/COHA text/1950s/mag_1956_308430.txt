Atomic radiation is dangerous , and as the atomic age develops , the danger will increase . This is the conclusion of the National Academy of Sciences ( TIME , June 25 ) , and the public is justified in taking it seriously . But in many parts of the world , the atom is being blamed for ills that it could not have caused , and for some that do not exist . <P> Last week in Washington the House Military Operations Subcommittee tried to stop a panicky rumor ( started by testimony at one of its hearings ) about the " dangers " of luminous watch dials , light-switch markers , etc . It published a reassuring letter from Physicist Lauriston S. Taylor of the National Bureau of Standards . <P> Luminous watch dials , he wrote , do contain radioactive material , but the quantity " is negligibly small and constitutes no hazard to the individual . . . unless one were to eat the dial . " Luminous switch markers are harmless , too , but Taylor urged moderation . " One should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for them . " <P> In West Germany the Hamburger Abendblatt ( circ. 310,000 ) prints daily reports of air radioactivity . Last week a banner headline screamed that the radioactivity of Hamburg 's air had risen tenfold between July 3 and July 5 . Not until the sixth paragraph did the Abendblatt 's expert admit that the activity was still too low to do any damage whatever . <P> Atomic Headache . As a result of such scaremongering , thousands of suggestible Germans have come down with " atomic headache . " The head of the Bavarian State Health Authority complained : " All the misfortune that Bavarians formerly ascribed to the Fohn ( a hot Alpine wind ) has now turned into the atomic head ache . " The Bavarian Minister of the Interior tried to convince complaining farmers that the yellowing of their pastures had nothing to do with atomic rain . In Salzburg cafe waiters warned departing guests not to go without hats for fear of atomic rain . <P> In Japan , where rain is sometimes really radioactive , a new term , " radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express a state of extreme nervousness which affects many Japanese after U.S. , Soviet and British bomb tests . In understandably jittery Hiroshima , welfare agencies publish bulletins after each rain to assure the citizens that it is not dangerous . In Osaka schoolchildren are told to wear plastic raincoats with hoods . One school held drills to teach the children how to hold their umbrellas so that their hands and faces would not get spattered . Policemen in Itami demanded plastic gloves because their service raincoats do not cover their hands . <P> Japanese scientists have tried to cure hoshano noirozeh by statements that the radioactive rain at its present strength will not hurt anyone . The public thinks it knows better .
