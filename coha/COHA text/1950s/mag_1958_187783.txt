Some Little Rock citizens could very nearly persuade themselves last week that the days of bad conscience were at an end . The city 's four high schools were still shut , and their almost 3,700 students-2,974 white , 724 Negro-were still locked out . But by week 's end 60% of them had either transferred to schools out of the city ( 650 students are estimated to have left ) or made arrangements to attend some sort of makeshift class . Most of the classes still lacked teachers , equipment and classrooms , and those that had got under way seemed better calculated to lull the old than inform the young . But makeshifts and promises have done their job well so far ; even after seven weeks of locked schools , few Little Rock white students and their parents are complaining out loud . <P> White Only . The segregationists ' sun shone brightest last week on the porticoed facade of a hand-me-down structure built 50 years ago as a Methodist orphanage , later used as a graduate center for the University of Arkansas , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and relabeled : Senior High School-Little Rock Private School Corp . Newly titled School Superintendent W. C. Brashears ( a former elementary school principal ) announced a solid-sounding curriculum ( " four years " of English , Arkansas and American history , applied mathematics , algebra , chemistry , physics , etc. ) , by week 's end had registered 241 seniors and 498 juniors and sophomores . Only trouble : there were just barely enough teachers and classrooms to start instruction for the seniors ( juniors were promised classes this week in two hurriedly purchased warehouses , but there is no immediate prospect of school for sophomores ) . Teachers recruited by Brashears are as varied as a Foreign Legion battalion , range from competent to questionable . School financing is by private donations . Last week Attorney General Bruce Bennett promised that each student forced to transfer to an accredited public or private school could draw perhaps as much as $172.66 in state funds for tuition , but accreditation of Little Rock 's stopgap schools seems doubtful .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
