When Cartoonist Al Capp invented the Shmoo , an animal which enabled man to live without working , everybody thought it was merely a Cappital joke . But in New Mexico 's rich Mesilla Valley last week , Farmer Deane Stahmann was running a Shmoo-like business which promised to revolutionize the agriculture of the valley . Farmer Stahmann was just the man to do it . He had inherited some land , and by leveling and irrigating more , transformed desert-like land into a 4,000-acre cotton farm . It helped make the Mesilla Valley one of the important U.S. cotton-producing areas . By pioneering with the planting of pecan trees between the cotton rows , Farmer Stahmann had brought a new commercial crop to the valley and made himself the U.S. pecan king . Farmer Stahmann 's latest agricultural experiment was with geese . <P> Hoe Hands . Troubled by the fact that his cotton plants had to be constantly hoed to keep them from being choked by wild grass , Stahmann built up a flock of 25,000 geese and found that they cleaned out the weeds just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire . Not only did the geese find their own food and enrich the soil with fertilizer , but when the cotton crop was harvested they could be sold . But they were not popular . Reason : high price . <P> An engineer-trained farmer , Stahmann runs his farm like a factory . When he took up pecans , for example , he cut down the labor needed for tree-shaking with a tree-shaking machine , something like a reducing vibrator . For his geese , Stahmann began a scientific test of the market , priced them low ( i.e. , only 20 profit per bird ) , found that housewives snapped them up as bargains . He set up batteries of incubators and brooders , invested $80,000 in an eviscerating and quick-freeze plant . His geese are now laying at the rate of 80,000 eggs a month , and Stahmann is hatching goslings at the rate of 2,000 a day . When he reaches capacity production he expects to be quick-freezing 2,500 oven-ready geese daily , for a net profit of some $125,000a year-provided that housewives take to geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stahmann is selling eggs and goslings to farmers all over the valley , encouraging them to start goose farms of their own . Since he has not enough cotton acreage to " run " all the geese he can slaughter , Stahmann has set up another plan . He sells five-week-old geese to other farmers at a low price , to use as hoe hands in their own cotton patches . After the geese have fattened for twelve weeks he buys them back at around the original price , for slaughter . As a result of all this goose-swapping , the farmers get free weeding and free fertilizer , Stahmann free fattening . <P> Stahmann is looking beyond the mere marketing of frozen geese , is already figuring out new commercial uses for feathers and down ( e.g. , a goosedown powder puff ) , expects to sell a lot of down for army bedrolls . Eventually he thinks he may make more out of the feathers than the geese .
