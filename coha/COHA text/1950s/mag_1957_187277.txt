" I 'll give these Neiman-Marcus people a year-two years , if they have plenty of money , three years , if they do n't care what happens to it . " So , the story goes , said a passing clothes drummer in 1907 of Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Neiman and Herbert Marcus , who hoped to bring Fifth Avenue fashions to the rawhide heart of the Southwest . Last week Neiman-Marcus was not only still around to celebrate a highly profitable golden anniversary ( annual sales of $36 million , earnings of $543,000 ) as one of the world 's finest specialty stores ( TIME , Sept. 21 , 1953 ) , but it was also ready to go Fifth Avenue one better . <P> To mark its birthday in typical Texas-tall style , the store traveled more than 4,000 miles across the Atlantic for foreign help in turning the city into one gigantic promotion spree . Naturally , Neiman 's chose France , where the highest fashion comes from-and naturally France was only too glad to help Neiman 's , where all good Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Paris via special Air France Constellation came a dazzling list of French business and fashion leaders . As the Thomas Jefferson High School band blared the Marseillaise , out stepped representatives of Paris ' haute couture , Pommery champagne and Lanvin perfumes , plus the mayor of Dijon , which , like Dallas , spells its name with a big " D. " Later , the emissaries from still more temples of luxury arrived-Chris-tolfe ( silver ) , Baccarat ( crystal ) , Fare ( gloves ) . Altogether , some 120 top French business executives made the pilgrimage along with Cover Girl Marie-Hlne Arnaux , France 's answer to U.S. Model Suzy Parker . Dallas was frankly overwhelmed . Oohed one Southern Methodist University coed : " Gee . I hardly know what 's going on . We 've only had three weeks of French . " <P> What was going on , as everyone else in Dallas knew , was probably the biggest birthday party ever attempted by any U.S. department store . All Dallas was swept into the act . For Neiman-Marcus ' " French Fortnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Lions , Kiwanians and Y.M.C.A. swooped down on visiting French dignitaries for a round of lunches and speeches . France 's most sought-after artist , Bernard Buffet ( TIME , Feb. 27 , 1956 ) , won the city by sporting a giant Stetson ; Authors Pierre Daninos ( The Notebooks of Major Thompson ) and Louise de Vilmorin were lionized at dinner parties .
