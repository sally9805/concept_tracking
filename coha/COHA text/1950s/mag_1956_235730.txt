The difference between bop and Dixieland musicians , Jazzman Eddie Condon once cracked , is that bop men flat their fifths , whereas Dixielanders drink theirs . <P> Pia Beck , 30 , a Dutch pianist who is sometimes called " the Flying Dutchess. ' ' can not tell a fifth from a fipple flute , but that does not keep her from bopping along on the cool side of the street and leaving the sunny side to Dixielanders . When Pia took off after a vocal chorus in English last week at the Tijuana , a Baltimore nightclub , listeners cried . " Hey , this chick 's not from Europe-she 's from Brooklyn ! " <P> Big , blonde and bustling , Pia is one in a series of foreign jazz pianists-including a blind Scotsman ( Joe Saye ) . an Argentine ( Enrique Villegas ) . a German ( Jutta Hipp ) and a Japanese ( Toshiko AkiyoshH - currently performing in the U.S. These pianists represent a reimported export , and Netherlander Beck is a fine sample of how exportable and reimportable jazz is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be no reason why New Orleans riffs can not be learned out side the U.S. " I dig jive , " says the girl from Holland , " but the most important thing is not to goof when you dig . " <P> Like many of the early American jazzmen , Pia is a musical illiterate , unable to read or write a note . While growing up in The Hague , Pia heard a lot of jazz . " I do n't know why , " she says , " but I always liked that jazz rhythm . " At eight , she sat at the family piano and syncopated familiar waltzes and minuets . From recordings of Louis Armstrong . Benny Goodman , Count Basic and other U.S. masters , she learned how to play around a melody , but when she went to study music-reading and correct technique-under the director of a Dutch conservatory of music , Pia could learn nothing . After three lessons the director told Pia . " What you do with your hands and arms is all wrong , but you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spoil it . " <P> Pia soon stretched her natural talent to songs in seven languages ( plus bop talk ) and music on seven instruments ( piano , accordion , vibraphone , guitar , bass , ukulele , clarinet ) . <P> Since the war . she has toured Europe , North Africa . Australia . Indonesia . From Baltimore , she and the rest of her trio ( American guitar and bass players ) . after a stop at Washington . D.C .. will go to Chicago 's jazz emporium , the Blue Note . Chicago is an exacting town for jazz musicians , but buxom Pia Beck is not worried . " I can always go back to Holland . " she says . ' T send a thousand cats a night over there .
