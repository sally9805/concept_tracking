To A.F.L.-C.I.O. strategists , the aircraft industry , fat with Government contracts , seemed the perfect target in the fight for a new round of wage increases ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) . They figured that the big planemakers , with the biggest backlogs in their history on the books , could easily pass along the extra wage cost . Last week the target was hit . In the first big strike of the year 12,000 members of the International Association of Machinists walked out of the Republic Aviation plant at Farmingdale , N.Y. , and three smaller branches ( including a guided missile plant ) . The company has $500 million in Government orders , mainly for the F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash . <P> The union demanded a 38 hourly wage package , later dropped to 19 . The company countered with a " final " offer of 5 , saying that it is already paying the industry 's highest average wage of $2.23 an hour , plus another 69 an hour in fringe benefits . Relations between Republic and the I.A.M. have been poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The union now has 12,000 members , leaving another 7,000 workers nonunion . The local is faction-ridden , has twice pulled wildcat walkouts . After a 1952 " sick " strike , the irritated international censured the local leaders . <P> Barely had the walkout begun last week than it turned violent . As nonstrikers tried to drive through the picket lines , the strikers threw themselves on the cars . The thin line of Long Island police , under orders not to carry nightsticks , was repeatedly overwhelmed . Once , as a mob of pickets rushed to an entrance to head off workers , a cop stood aside . " What the hell was I going to do ? " he muttered . " I was outnumbered 200 to 1 . " <P> Inside the factory executives and plant police set up cots , stocked the cafeteria with several weeks ' supply of frozen meats and vegetables , and mounted cameras at the gates to record the struggle to stop incoming cars . Few production workers were able to get through . The union offered to give 4,000 nonproduction-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided they turned out no planes . But the company flatly refused the I.A.M. offer . <P> In the first six days of rioting at the gates , 139 were arrested , more than 30 injured . At week 's end Republic brought its cameras to the New York State Supreme Court , for 15 minutes showed scenes of mob violence by strikers , won a temporary injunction against mass picketing . Meanwhile , fighter plane production was completely stopped .
