 | fast becoming my best friend . I dressed prettily and rather childishly , as Anthony desired ; rode every day with the ladies or occasionally with the bachelors , but never the same one twice in a row . My mother had done so well in India as the wife of Colonel Ferguson as to gloss over the fact that my father had risen from the ranks . At least no one dared to throw it up at me . I made a prayer to my childhood gods  --  took it back  --  made it again to a Mrs. Grundy kind of god who seemed to have such matters in charge . It was that I might never be such a fool as to trade my pleasant mess of pottage for a vague , perhaps visionary birthright . My name was Lucia Reeve . When I thought of Lola Montero , I felt inchoate emotions overcast by anxiety . I was troubled and a little ashamed because I did not get close to our servants ; but perhaps I could not have done so , had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not find beauty imaged there , instead the vividly pretty young memsahib that my husband loved . My lines had fallen in such pleasant places . I was so lucky to have been so rash ! Our letters to Dinapore had gone by post pony overland to Benares , then downriver . The reply from the commandant there arrived in a little over four months and was pleasant and humorous as the occasion called for . Inquiries had been sent on foot . But the memsahib must be patient  --  after all , India was a somewhat thickly populated country . Servants did not always stay put . A good deal could happen to ten years . I heard from my letter more than a month later . The reply came from the proprietor of the teahouse , written by a professional scribe in ink of several different colors , containing many allusions to my eminence and glory , but one of the most moving I had ever received . Manu was well remembered and had made it his custom to call monthly there for mail , until his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then he had called personally twice , and sent couriers twice to inquire in his stead . The writer would send word by journeyers to Patna to seek him out and bid him return to receive memsahib 's favor . If he still breathed , she could expect an answer within one , at the most two rains .  | My tears had begun to flow before I had read three lines ; before the end I was weeping in a childlike transport of mingled joy and pain . Anthony heard me and hurried in . " Darling , what in the world ? " " Manu 's alive ! At least he was until just lately . He kept his promise to me all these years ? " I stopped , because of the expression on his face . It was kind , but a little embarrassed , too . He wanted to understand , but , of course , he could not , and that always annoyed him . " Darling , I do n't think it calls for any such outburst of emotion . Perhaps you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main contents of the letter . " I still do n't see it 's anything to cry about , " he said , smiling down at me . " In the first place , you do n't know whether the writer is telling the truth  --  he 'd naturally play along , you know , for any advantage that might accrue to him  --  and if he is , Manu 's keeping his promise to you was partly good business . No doubt he 's fond of you , but , of course , he was always looking for a main chance ? " " Will you write to the Commissioner at Patna to try to locate him ? " I broke in , when I could hear no more . " I ca n't do that , my love . I do n't know him personally  --  he 'd think it was very odd  --  you 're letting yourself be carried away by a childhood sentiment . If you want my opinion  --  any further search for him would be beneath the dignity of both of us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that moment my relations with him began to change . I knew it was a dangerous change , stemming from what I could very easily argue was weakness , but which my heart knew was strength . I felt immensely strengthened by the almost assurance that Mann was alive and would come to me . I did not feel such a deep need of the security Anthony gave me . That meant I might risk it some day , and thereby lose it . To be a good wife to him would be a harder task from this moment on . Lola , her wings clipped , was sprouting stout plumes again . The danger at once frightened and thrilled me . I knew of only two events that would restore my safety . One was to become convinced of Manu 's death . The other was to have a  | baby . The first was opposed by a superstititious feeling of great persistence and force . The chances of the second were diminishing rapidly with the passing seasons , as my husband became ever less hopeful , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a deeply ingrained feeling that passion was something " to be satisfied , " but never lovely in itself . An increasing amount of his energies went to riding and shooting . I found that I did not mind very much  --  I had my own dreams . In these my partner was usually Rene  --  sometimes someone I was unable to recognize  --  occasionally to my amazement it was Jeffery . When this occurred , the bliss was intense , but I wakened with a sense of having narrowly escaped a rushing darkness , eerie , evil , and obliterative as death . In the house was a music box made by some tireless German craftsman that played eight pieces at one winding of the spring . These were mostly French and Italian airs , melodious and charming . I had it put in my room , and when there was no danger of interruption , I stripped to my shift , tied on my castanets , and danced to them to my heart 's content . Near the close of my second year at Poona there came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hired scribe . I slipped it out of sight until I could take it to my room , and while carrying on some sort of a conversation with Anthony , I was thinking how few people I knew to whom I could confide the fever in my brain and the tremor in my hands . Manu himself  --  Rene  --  my dancing masters  --  some humble people I had known and , strangely enough , the most exalted , Lundy of Blackmoor . I need wear no veil before Jeffery . That might be more true of complete antagonists than of ordinary lovers , I thought . When the sinner confesses his most hidden sin to God , he becomes a saint . When he confides his last goodness to the devil , he becomes his brother . Behind a locked door , I opened the letter in wild hope and terror . It had been dictated by Manu and his spirit came into the room . He had pledged his labor for six months , to provide for certain loved ones ; and would start forth for Poona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich now , and it was my desire that he come quickly , I must send him fifty rupees , enough to redeem him from what  | remained of the debt when the sum would reach him and speed his journey . If my purse were thin , he would stop along the road betimes to earn his onward passage . For it was not meet that the servant of Lola Memsahib beg in sight of the gods . Since Anthony had only a smattering of Hindustani , I read the letter aloud to him , making such changes as I thought best . I should have known he would be unpleasantly surprised . He had long ago concluded that Manu was lost or dead . " He probably has children and a wife or two , " Anthony said . " Do n't you think you 'd better send him a ten-rupee note for the sake of old times and tell him to stay put ? " " I think his children are all grown up , " I answered , my throat tight . " He 's over fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were a mere baby . You gave him the affection you could n't give your mother ? " " He gave me the love she would n't give me . I 've loved him for it ever since . " " I wish you would n't speak of loving a native . Although I know what you mean , it does n't sound right . He 's not an old English nanny or even a butler that the young master or mistress may feel a warm affection for all their lives . " " No , he 's not . I never had an English nanny . I never saw an English butler till I moved to the General 's house . He 's an old lowcaste Indian ? " " And you , my dear , are the Lieutenant Colonel 's memsahib . You may very soon be Lady Reeve . What you feel for Manu is a holdover from childhood that you had better let die . " " It never will die . " " Please temper your language , Lucia . What you say is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , I 'll ask you not to let him come . " " You promised me when you proposed to me that he could have a place in our household . " " I know I did . At that time I did n't realize the hold he has on you . I do n't like it , Lucia . I ask you to relieve me of my promise .  | " If you do n't let him come , I 'm going back to England and take him with me . " " Lucia ! How can you say such a thing ? I do n't like to remind you ? " He paused . " Of all you 've done for me ? " " I suppose I was thinking that . I could hardly help it , could I ? " " No , you could n't help it . But he 's done just as much for me as you have . " " Great heavens ! " " I 'll be grateful all my days for what you 've given me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me second lady of a regiment  --  he did n't rescue me from poverty  --  but he did save me from death . " " Do you mean he saved your life in some accident ? " " He saved me from death . He went with me to fight death . I ca n't explain it any more . " " Lucia , this is the first time we 've ever stood apart on any issue . This is the first barrier that has ever risen between us . But I 'll meet you halfway . Let 's put this precious love of his to test . Do n't send any money  --  do n't write him . Then if he makes the journey all the way from Patna , I 'll feel that his devotion to you is real , and he is n't trying to take advantage of your childhood affection for him . In that case , I 'll put him in our service for as long as he proves worthy of it . " I turned away and looked out the window . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to new forms . These were the sepoy troops , natives being drilled to fight other natives . Farther on were the lines where they were quartered ; on our side of the field were the Tommies ' barracks and a row of cottages where the married soldiers lived . For an officer 's wife to drink tea with the wife of a sergeant would be detrimental to discipline . It was detrimental to the discipline of society for a memsahib to love an old servant more than her husband  --  indeed it was an offense akin to sacrilege . But I did  --  and once I had been Lola , who had not let man-made discipline  --  man-decreed sacrilege  --  check  | " I 'm not going to test his love , " I said , hardly knowing what I was saying amid my soaring thoughts . " When I have to test someone 's love , I do n't want it . " " Lucia , you 've been parted from this man for eleven years . You 've come back to India as the wife ? " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Lola 's birth place . Somewhere the brawny Lohar hammered the great iron . By Manu 's acknowledging her , she had found strength to lash the breast of Kali . She had bowed her head to the red-handed goddess at General Judson 's bedside , and he had not heard again the trumpets of Waterloo , but she wished to God she had n't or never would again . Kali , I hate you ! I was born and shaped to fight you all my life and became formidably armed . This now is a tiny skirmish with you on a small , obscure field , but I do not know why , and if I tried to find a practical reason for its truth , I would doubt that truth . " I 'm going to send him the money out of some I 'd saved when we were married . " I had been about to say some money that General Judson had given me , but that would not be true . I was going to spend that as he would like , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fifty-pound note , not as its giver would wish  --  indeed as he would greatly fear  --  according to my hate . " Very well , " my husband answered . " Understand it is very much against my advice and wishes . I hope it will work out well . If it does n't  --  I 'm frightened of the consequences . " TWENTY-TWO I SUPPOSE Anthony wondered how I was going to transmit fifty rupees clear across India with the least assurance of their safe arrival . Manu himself had told me how it was done , when he had wished to send five rupees to an uncle in Madras in a family crisis of fifteen years ago . It was a simple matter of depositing fifty-five rupees with a Marwari money-lender in Poona . On the receipt of  | the draft , Manu could collect the sum from another Marwari Patna . In the letter I enclosed a pass to the reservation , and a cha which I had bought for three annas from a holy man . It consist of the names of beneficent spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ink and swallowing the water , Manu could fa the journey without fear . It was then mid-January . In the next two months my husha never mentioned the affair and was gentle and often affections toward me , partly perhaps as balm to his conscience for the wi father to the thought , that Manu would devote the money to his o uses and probably write for more . As the drought deepened un the blaze of the April sun , I pictured him traveling southwestw on the great highway from Allahabad to Jubbulpore  --  southward Nagpur  --  turning sharply west through Berar  --  almost to Auran bad , of the tomb of the Queen of Aurangzeb . His bare feet m an endless chain of prints in the dust . At night his stick fire flam and flickered out as he slept safely under a peepul tree beside t road . Late in May , torn and tattered clouds began to stream across the sky . Sometimes at sundown they thickened into banks , and a wind with coolness in it , almost a dampness , rustled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbled in the distance and a few big , warm drops of rain squashed in the dust . On the last night of the month , the wind soughed all night , and lightnings played all over the starless sky . The clouds did not break at dawn , but dark . ened and lowered . There came a moment of deep suspense  --  all the high gods stopped their businesses  --  the fowls in the yards stretched their necks  --  the dogs sniffed the air  --  only the cart buffaloes cared naught , sullenly plodding before the goad that was god . Then with great choral music , as when a sea storm had broken on the moors , down flung the rains . Manu was late for our appointment . I sat nearly an hour at the window before I made out a dim form , a pack on his shoulder , wearily walking up the alleyway behind the officers ' row . But his step hastened as he saw the gate of our compound . The chokidar would be squatting in his hut out of the wet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich house . Is it not a long way from the child who kissed her servant 's hands when the memsahib had ordered her banishment across the dark waters ? I am newly come , the cup of my returning new raised to my lips ; and if you will give the word , I will straightway go . I will dwell as I have dwelt since then , with my heart gone from me , but yet taking joy in my children and their babes and in food and sleep and a pipe after labor , and in little things . But if I look upon you at sundown and at sunrise , if I lie one night at your call , then if you send me away from you , my spirit will depart from me also , and I will be like unto the living dead . " " Why should I send you away , beloved ? " " Have you great riches of your own ? " " Nay . " " Have you a high place across the black waters ? " I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the boats floundered in the river . On the day following you went with me to see Lohar straighten the bent keel . On that day I saw you with clear eyes , and visions came unto me of the years to come , and in time I told you those visions , and they set your heart on fire . But now the fire burns low . You are happy in the place you have won . When I asked at the gate at what house dwelt Memsahib Lola , young wife of the Lieutenant Colonel Sahib  --  the writing of his name was deep in my bundle , out of the rain  --  the sepoy mocked me for a fool , saying none of the memsahib-log was named Lola , and if I were seeking the wife of Ree-va Sahib , who was young , and joy to the eyes of all the poor and lowly , and who spoke Hindustani as though born in the bazaar , her name on the lips of her husband and friends was Lucia . " " Then you remembered calling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on the night we went to the great pooja in Chota Nagpur , I beheld you as Lola , the daughter of Lohar . It was she with whom I went to the shrine of Kali on that terrible night of the full moon . Do you not know I will ever be a reminder of what is lost ? Because you love me , you can not shut your ears to your true  | me . It may be you will no longer make offering unto Kubera and anesa , and will again make pooja unto Krishna the Joyous , the god common folk . That is not well  --  at least it is not wise for  --  one of e sahib-log . " I knew all that . I might have known that Manu would know it , at first glance at me . I stood naked in the mirror of his eyes . " Nay , it is not wise . " " I will tell you what I see , as though we had made mounds of cow dung , and poured on milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and this , too . " His gesture indicated the big house and all it stood for , and his eyes glowed in the dark room with prophetic fire . " The magic we have made together was weakened by our parting , but it will regain its potence if we unite . For know , Lola Memsahib , that I love you beyond all heaven and earth , and for that you will reward me , even as I foretold . " " What will be your reward , Manu ? " " That you will be true to thy name . " I had only to say it was behudgi ( fool 's talk ) . No , I need not say even that  --  I had only to quiet my heart a little , close and doubt it a little ; and then he would look into my eyes , pick up his pack , and go out the door . Instead I heard my voice thrilling and strange . " I will not let you go . " " Even if I bless you first ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , would it not be offering unto Kali ? " " Aye , but I know not why . " " Then would you go to the burning ghat ? " " Yea , very soon . " " You shall not go from me . I love you . " Manu knocked out his pipe and cleaned it well . The glow in his eyes had died . Then he groped in his pouch . " Here be ten rupees left of the sum you sent me . You had better save it for the hour of need . " To delay that hour I resolved to devote the main of my energies to preserving what I still called my marriage . I could call it that , but really it did not amount to that any more . Anthony and I shared the same house , very rarely the same bed ; and  | very few of the same interests . He was proud of me as I appeared to his competitors and associates , but ashamed of  --  at least resentful toward  --  what he thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as much as he loved me . I was sure that I loved him a good deal more than that  --  love being a word of many meanings . I per ceived his stature in his own faith and field  --  I still thrilled over his high-mindedness in Mamma 's parlor and his noble proposal ? and felt compassion , itself an aspect of love , for his constant cramping of his own best nature . His love for me was mainly part of his religion  --  I was his lawful wife , and it was his duty to love me and he always did his duty . I was sure now that I could never surrender to him enough to allow him to feel the possessive love that the word meant to him ; but I knew how to fascinate him and raise his selfesteem . I could raise , I thought , the level of his happiness . Manu became my groom , the office that would permit us to be together the most in my husband 's absence , and the least in his presence . Manu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plug he could stay on , and on country lanes the beast 's head beside the tail of mine permitted us easy conversation . I almost never mentioned him to Anthony and I thought he was becoming reconciled to what he considered an act of insubordination on my part , hardly short of mutiny . I entertained him by the hour . I shone when he wanted me to shine , and when he did not , went into eclipse . I was Lola only in Manu 's eyes , in which sometimes I saw her reflected . Sometimes the image dimmed even there . For the first setback after Manu 's return I was not in the least to blame . Sir Spencer Reeve had remarried the year before  --  a marriage for companionship , he wrote , to a lady of mature years  --  and envisioning a quiet , elderly couple drinking tea before the fire , Anthony had not been worried about the succession of the baronetcy . But the end of the rains brought a triumphant letter dripping with joy and gladness for Anthony to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a son and heir ! Some of his friends had been doubtful that a marriage between a gentleman of seventy-two and a lady of forty-two could be a success , but they had been proven false prophets !  | " I 'll bet it 's a little bastard , " I remarked , instinctively trying to ease the tension in Tony 's face . " Lucia , I do n't appreciate that kind of humor at my uncle 's and my aunt 's expense . " I had forgotten a like difference between my husband 's age and my own . It was the darkest anger I had ever seen possess him , and there was nothing I could say to turn it away . I nodded and quickly left the room . Perhaps I would have done better to have struck hack ; a blaze of rage might have welded again our breaking bond . The next event of large and clear-cut bearing on the issue was a street incident oddly reminiscent of that in which I met Rene and Jeffery . On the way home from a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , leaving both horses in Manu 's care , went into a shop . Emerging , I stopped to look at some brasswork in the shadow of the doorway and in sound of Manu 's voice . He was talking to a finelooking sepoy from one of the native regiments quartered across the drill field from ours , " My memsahib is the wife of Lieutenant Colonel Sahib , " Manu was saying in the informal vernacular . " She is the most beautiful memsahib I have seen , " his companion replied . Then asking the question uppermost in the native mind about any marriage : " Has she borne him sons ? " " To her deep sorrow , no . " At that moment a tall man in mufti , pausing to light his pipe , pricked up his ears . I recognized him as Captain Henry , a late arrival at the station in command of a company of Raj puts , and already known as a martinet . But I was not warned in time . " Why is it that memsahibs are so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three ? " the sepoy asked , unaware of the sahib standing behind him . " Think you they are cold to their lord 's plowing , or do their furrows lack richness ? " Captain Henry took two lithe strides , seized the sepoy by the shoulder , whirled him around , and smote him hard in the face . " That will teach you to keep your dirty tongue off memsahibs , " he said in a brutal voice . The Captain knew Hindustani , but he did not know Rajputs ,  | however he might presume to command them . They were one of the most proud and courageous clans in India . I had already suspected that the sepoy was one of them , and I knew it when he struck back as swiftly as one of his desert wolves . Captain Henry reeled back from the blow , then took a threatening posture . However , he soon thought better of teaching any more lessons here and now to this lithe son of the thirst ; perhaps he remembered his dignity as an officer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cold , clipped tones . " You are under arrest . " At once he walked on . Throughout the incident , my instinct had been to remain unseen . I was a lieutenant colonel 's wife who must not figure in street fights . But it had never occurred to me that since he had struck first . Captain Henry would order the man 's arrest . " I saw what happened and I will speak for you to the sardar , " I told the sepoy . After writing down his name and his number , I sped home as fast as I could and reported the entire incident to Anthony . " I 'm sorry you happened to be present , " he said . I was incredulous , " My God , I 'm glad I was ! You ca n't tell what that beastly man will do . He may try to get him sent to prison ? " " He 'll be lucky to get off with ten years . " " What ? " " It 's a capital offense for an enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer was in mufti would ordinarily mitigate it , but in this case I presume the sepoy struck his own captain . You thought he was a Rajput , and Captain Henry has the only company of Rajputs on the reservation . " " Anthony , you heard me say that the brute struck him first ? " " When he heard the sepoy using obscene language about white women ? Pray do n't apply such terms as beastly ' and brute ' to your defender  --  for he was defending you as well as all other memsahibs . You particularly , in fact , since the conversation began with you . It was held with your precious Manu . I 'll personally congratulate Captain Henry for striking him  --  it was very mild punishment to say the least . A just judge at the court-martial ca n't increase the sentence for what the fellow was saying to another native , but he  | certainly does n't need to reduce it because his remarks were properly rebuked . The judge will consider only the sepoy 's blow ? " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stood there , my heart torn at what I saw in his face . It was not his own nature that had cast the dark pall of anger there , that had hardened his eyes and drawn his mouth into an expression of cruelty . It was a mask of evil put on in invocation of evil gods  --  the gods he must invoke when the good gods would not let him speak in their name .... " May I say one thing more ? " I asked , when the cold , rasping noise finally ceased . " Of course , Lucia . " " The sepoy had no notion of being obscene . The natives ' sense of imagery causes them to compare the male sex organ to a plow , and the female to a furrow . " " How did you know that interesting fact ? " " I listened to a great deal of native talk when I was a child . " " It gave you some strange ideas , to say the least . " " I 'm going to see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , I 'll go before it and testify to what I 've just told you , and that I took not the slightest offense at it . I do n't think the judge advocate would dare refuse me . " " You would use those very words ? " " What 's wrong with them ? " " A lady does not speak so in public . Lucia , I 've done the best I can . I forbid you to appear at the court-martial . " I nodded and at once went into the courtyard and ordered my horse resaddled . On this ride , I did not take Manu with me  --  it was only to the shafakhana to see Dr. Haines . He received me in his cluttered office , and at the first glance into his wise , kindly face much of my pain was healed . Again I recited the street incident from first to last , and he wrote it down word for word . " The fools ! " he cried , when I was through . " They 'll keep on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India in blood . Well , I 'll go before the court . I 'll insist on being heard as an expert on native idiom  --  by God , I 've written on it for the Indian Survey !  | No fear I wo n't be heard ! I 'll show that Henry 's blow for chivalry was nothing but a piece of damned stupidity . That ought to temper the sentence . " " What will happen to you ? " " I wo n't be very popular with the pukka sahibs , but I do n't think I 'll lose my standing with the burra sahibs  --  such as Henry Lawrence . I would n't mind being transferred for the good of the Service  --  especially if I could get in a regiment on the Afghan border . I 'd like to know those desert men better . " He paused , his eyes full of thoughts , then leaned toward me . " Look , Lucia . I wish we could get the court-martial delayed . It it 's held now , we ca n't save that fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and this is a military secret that a doctor has no business knowing  --  the sepoy regiment is going to be sent to the Northwest Frontier . Hell 's going to pop there soon  --  thanks to some more fools . This fellow would , of course , be left behind , under arrest . With Captain Henry out of the picture , I could do a lot more for him . " When I had risen to go , he looked at me searchingly . " You know , Lucia , I 'd like to write a monograph inspired by you . I 'd like to give it a fancy title  --  Beauty and the Beast ' ? the Beast being the shape of humanity . Do you remember that in the fairy tale he was really a prince who had been enchanted by an evil witch , and Beauty restored him to his rightful form ? Humanity , too , has been bewitched  --  often it appears in such ugly guise  --  it does such inhuman things . Science ca n't undo the spell  --  lawmakers ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses . One great Beauty revealed nearly two thousand years ago did more than any other one thing to save us , but it 's been blackened by hypocrites . Our only real hope lies in the Beauty of Woman . If only she could realize her power ! " I left him with revived hopes . But he was not able to postpone the court-martial , and the stern judges conceded only that since the prisoner had not intended any insult to white women , his offense of returning Captain Henry 's blow was moderated . He was neither shot nor sent to penal servitude . Instead he was paraded before the regiment , his insignia cut off , and drummed out of the army ,  | But the following morning , when the sepoy regiment received orders to march to the Northwest Frontier , Captain Henry 's company of Raj puts refused to fall in line . TWENTY  --  THREE STERN measures ! That was the term for what must be taken , loose on the lips of the women . They 've got to be made an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the boat , mouthed the sentence till it turned into a kind of shibboleth , to identify the mouther as a pukka memsahib . But something more than pukkahood had set the lips of the officers in grim lines . Unless sternly dealt with , they said , the mutiny might spread first to the other companies of the regiment , then throughout the Bombay and Bengal armies . The four chapatties ( unleavened bread ) would be passed to the four winds  --  each receiver making four more , the old Indian way of spreading an alarm . The mutinous troops were given one brief moment to reconsider , then were arrested and ironed . Now , while the other sepoy companies seethed with excitement , the guard stood over them with ready rifles . There was no time to send for instructions from the High Command ; at General Headquarters the brigadier and his staff sat in solemn council to decree the punishment . " They wo n't have any trouble deciding , " a major 's wife told me . " You see this has happened before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they only have to follow precedent . In each case the fire was put out before it could spread . " I knew of those two cases . About eighty years ago , thirty mutinous sepoys were lashed to the mouths of cannons and blown to pieces . Less than twenty years ago , the 2nd Bengal Infantry had refused to march to the Burmese War , and again the big guns  --  although at a somewhat larger range  --  had taught all India a lesson . The thought of appealing to Anthony brushed my mind and vanished . I was willing to hear from him that he could do nothing  | in a matter serious as this  --  actually a crisis endangering the empire . What I could not bear to hear him say was that stern measures were not only necessary but right  --  that God intended for England to rule India and the Indian people would be the first to suffer if our hold were weakened . True , it was damned unpleasant business . I had better put it out of my mind as something that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good book , and go to my room ... . There was no use of going to Major Haines . A regimental doctor did not have the standing of an officer commanding troops ... . For a moment my hopes leaped at the thought of our Colonel 's wife , Mrs. Radford . She was the daughter of a viscount , and the greatest in India sat at her table . Then I remembered what she had told me when I had confided to her the growing rift between Anthony and me . " I 've stopped trying to do big things out here . I do only little things . I can get a doctor for one native woman about to die in childbirth , but not for a thousand . I can bring a little gift to a corporal 's wife dying of heartbreak , but I ca n't make a dent in the dogma of the military caste . I have n't the stuff of heroism . I 'm a woman Nicodemus , who with a troubled mind and heart goes on her way . " So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth could I turn ? The way of it was to put on a riding habit and order my horse . Manu rode well behind me until we went out the main gate of the reservation , then drew his horse 's head beside the tail of mine . " Which way , Manu ? " I asked . " Do you wish to ride far , memsahib ? " " I do not know . " " The memsahib must ride very far to escape the sound of the guns . " " Will there be guns , Manu ? " " Assuredly there will be guns , perhaps the great guns , perhaps those fired from the shoulder . In either case , the memsahib must ride far to escape their sound . " " What is to be gained by staying near enough to hear them ? " " Nothing that I know of , memsahib . "  | " When do you think they will be fired ? " " Before sundown . " " The sun is even now halfway down the sky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you not call me Memsahib Lola ? " " I can not  --  when we are both so weakened and afraid . " " Yea , there is something to be gained , though I can not count its worth . It is pain  --  and anger . " " Truly . " " Would you rather have pain and anger than weakness and fear ? " " Yea , memsahib . " " If we would have them in great store , it is not enough to hear the sound of the guns . We must also see their fires of death , and our brethren die . " " That be true . " " Do you know a place where we may go ? " " The crest of Pak Pahari looks down on the sepoys ' drilling ground . You know the road . " " Aye , so I do . " We rode that way in silence until we were winding up the hillside . " Manu , why did the company of Raj puts disobey the sardar 's command ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that their tribe had made truce with the Sons of Allah of Bahawalpur , kinsmen of the Pathan . " " Is it true ? " " It could well be true that their particular clan , dwelling on the border , and tired of fighting over the water or the grass , have declared truce . " " Is that the reason they refused to fight the Pathan ? " " No , memsahib , unless my mind tricks me . " " Was it in fury for the unjust punishment meted out to one of their clan ? " " Their fury had no vent and darkened their souls . Before then , the hand of Henry Sahib lay heavy upon them , because he knew not how to lead them , only to drive them , and they hate his shadow on  | the ground . During that darkening , came the order to fight their ancient and most feared enemies . They remembered then the soothsaying that none who go through Khyber Pass shall ever return . So their hearts failed . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance was better than none . " " Death at the hands of the Pathan , who howl as they come waving their great knives , is many deaths in one . They sucked in fear of it with their mothers ' milk . They have heard how the Pathan women cut apart the enemy dead , so they may not be born again in mortal form . They would face it , if their hearts were high , but these have been brought low . It may be they themselves do not know their terror , but I stood near when they refused the order , and I saw it in their eyes . " " Manu , I will speak not as Lola , but as the memsahib of the Colonel Sahib . These men had taken oath to obey their officers ' commands . " " Even so . " " A soldier is nothing if not brave . It is right that those who desert should be shot , for their faithlessness and as an example to the rest who are afraid . It is a misfortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahib , who darkens instead of brightens their hearts ; yet it is still the duty of the General Sahib to shoot them . " " Aye , it be his duty , by the light he sees . " " By what light do we see , Manu ? " " I know not . It shone upon us long ago . It is very bright here on the crest of the hill . If you are the memsahib of the Colonel Sahib , it would be best that we descend and wait in the shade . " . " It is only the sunlight , Manu . " " Aye , the shine of the hot sun . " The rim of the reservation , along which sentries marched , lay only a furlong below us . The naked brown drill field was nearly a mile wide at this place , but looking across to the guardhouse , we could see that the day 's duty was under way . Two regiments of redcoats were forming for a parade . At this distance we could not see whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to tell them as men with white skins or dark skins or guts or brains instead of merely military formations . They formed swiftly changing geometrical designs , then began to move in two columns into the field . Their pace was very slow . Between them was another formation  --  a moving frame with thin red borders , containing a white rectangle that moved with it . If one looked closely , one could see that the frame was made of men wearing red coats , its contents men whose coats had been taken off . These men did not keep step with the rest . They gave the effect of moving on rollers instead of feet . That was because they were taking very short , quick steps . I need not ask Manu why that was . Behind and at one side of the formations were what looked like little dogs pulling tiny carts from which thin things projected behind . In the language of the military , guns were being moved into position . We were not near enough to hear the drivers ' shouts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared smooth , sedate , as inconsequential as the detail of a dream . The two columns halted in the center of the field , and each became two long , parallel red lines . Between them the white rectangle became a much shorter white line . What had been the sides and back of the thin red frame curiously folded up and then parted in the middle . Both sides , now short red lines , moved to opposite ends of the white line , and then very slowly approached each other . These were not any longer stiff and straight , but wavered sideways and up and down . " What are the guards doing ? " I asked Manu . I was almost certain but I wanted to be sure . " They are taking off the leg irons , memsahib , " Manu answered . " Wo n't the prisoners run when the big guns begin to shoot ? " " No , memsahib . I have never known condemned men to run from the guns and so make sport for the watchers . Besides , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait for Kali . They have resigned themselves unto her . " " It is merciful compared to tying them to the guns ' mouths . " " Even so , I would that the sahibs had used the little guns instead of big ones . Then the Rajputs could go whole to the burning ghats. "  | had hooked his reins over the pommel and was hanging on with both hands . The thorns had snatched off his turban and his long hair streamed behind . A sentry taking shelter behind a rock shouted at us as we rode into the field . The most direct course to the Rajput was straight toward two of the four guns beyond , and as yet the line concealed us from the gunners , but I need rally no courage to use my whip and spur , and Manu 's tame old horse came bounding behind us like a sheik 's Arab charging into battle . There was no other sound but the drum of hoofs on the sun-baked ground . The dressed troops had eyes for nothing but the prisoners waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the cannon mouths blazed , and the earth shook and the air rocked with their rolling thunders . Shrill through the crash rose a long scream that met and passed us and ceased . The line of Raj puts was not quite so long , and there was a gap in its center wide enough for two horsemen to stand abreast . I drew my rein a little to head for it . The white shirt of a mutineer standing next to the gap suddenly turned red as the red tunics of the watching soldiery , then he sank down with his prone , quiet brethren . At that instant frantic shouts rose here and there along the dressed ranks , and several horsemen dashed into the field . I drew up and stopped just in front of a little cluster of dead men . Manu took his position full beside me . I looked into the faces of the yet alive , and there was such glory in them that no future punishment dealt to them or to Manu or to me could ever strike full force . TWENTY-FOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious calmness for the approaching officers . They rode fast , then slowly ; they checked their horses a little behind that of the General ; all their faces were similarly set and all except one had a gray cast . One  --  my husband 's  --  was white .  | " What does this mean , Mrs. Reeve ? " the General asked quietly . " What it seems to mean , sir , I suppose . " " Are you aware that by military law we would have been justified in regarding your action as aiding and abetting the mutineers and kept on firing ? " " I did n't think about that . " " I believe I know what you did think . I heard your testimony , as given by Major Haines , in regard to the sepoy who struck his captain . He was a member of this company . You believed that the company mutinied because of an injustice done him , in which you were involved . The real reason they mutinied was that they are cowards . They are afraid to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been afraid lots of times myself , and sometimes turned tail . " " Both of you get on your horses and get out of here as fast as you can . " " So you can fire some more volleys ? " " That is our affair , not yours . " " You 'll have to take us by force . " " What are you saying ? " " I 'm going to stay , and my servant will stay with me . Whatever we 've done , wrong or right , we 're going to stick by it as long as we can . We 'll both fight as long as we can with our whips and our hands . We 'll do that much before you drag us away . All India will know it  --  England will know it  --  and it will do some good in the long run . " He was still a long minute , then he turned to Colonel Reeve . " This is a public matter , involving the welfare of the Empire , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , " my husband answered . " Mrs. Reeve , perhaps it was so all India and England could know it  --  and know of you  --  that you did this . " " No , sir , it was not . " He turned to Captain Henry . " Can any of those men speak English ? " " No , sir . "  | " Gentlemen , " the General went on , addressing his fellow officers , " Mrs. Reeve has taken advantage of us . It 's quite true that if the word spreads that the wife of an English lieutenant colonel rode into the field to shelter a company of mutineers from cannon fire , the consequences would be more disastrous than I can readily imagine , It might set off mutiny in all the sepoy armies . I 'm sorry to reveal this disadvantage in her hearing , but it is unavoidable , if the disgrace is going to be kept quiet . Mrs. Reeve , did you tell anyone of your plan ? " " No , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone tell you that the mutineers were to be gunned ? " " No , sir . I asked Manu during our ride what would happen . He thought they would be gunned . " " Will you make a written statement that on returning from your ride you took a short cut across the drill field  --  that a cannon ball passed near you  --  and not realizing that these men were the target , you rode toward them seeking safety ? " " I will , if you will remit all punishment but dishonorable discharge . " " I had ordered only one more volley . For your information , all four crews had orders to hit once and to miss once , four punishing balls in all . But as much as it goes against the grain , if you agree to my proposal and give your oath to live up to it , I 'll be inclined to let the men off with drumming them out of the regiment . " " General ? " It was a voice rough with fury . " Yes , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to remit the punishment , I ask permission to put a question . " " Very well . " " The mutineers know why she came . How are they to be stopped from telling it all over India unless they 're shot or sent to prison ? " Up spoke Dr. Haines , who had got down from his horse to see if any life remained in the fallen Rajputs . He was always speaking out of turn . He seemed unable to learn military procedure . " I can handle that , General . "  | " What do you mean , Major Haines ? " If you care to do what you said  --  on Mrs. Reeve 's agreeing to make the statement you propose and live up to it  --  I can bind the Raj puts with her . " There was no sound for long-drawn seconds , and the General 's face was like flint . " Under those conditions , I will remit the punishment to three months at hard labor and then drumming them out of the army . Mrs. Reeve , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " party " Yes , sir . " " Major Haines , you may try to bind the mutineers ; you speak Hindi better than any of us . But take note they have broken one oath made with lifted hands . " The doctor turned to the mutineers and drew their eyes to his . " The General Sahib has asked me to say that the memsahib 's coming among you was the fault of her ignorance of the punishment being meted out , and while riding across the field , she was frightened by what she thought was target practice by the gunners . Ye know better , but if ye will take oath before Brahma to tell that tale and never reveal the truth to wife or friend or priest or anyone , the General Sahib will spare ye from the guns , and restrict your punishment to three months hard labor and then being drummed out of the army . Will ye touch your hands to your foreheads , in fealty to that oath ? " They did so , dropping on their knees , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight . " Major Woolford , you served in Rajputana , " the General said to one of his staff . " Do you think that oath 's any good ? " " I must say I never heard of a Raj put breaking an oath made on his knees , " the officer answered . " The stiff-legged devils do n't take that posture often . " " But will the Tommies believe it  --  and our own people throughout India ? " a colonel asked . " I do n't want them to know that a lieutenant colonel 's wife ? " " I can answer that , as far as most of the important white people  | are concerned , " Dr. Haines said . He had turned white and his voice trembled . " They would n't believe the truth , but they 'll be glad to believe the substitute . They like substitutes for any truth that hurts their eyes . Some of the Tommies who saw it will be disappointed that a wonder turned into a joke . The sepoys in the lines who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . I 'll not be able to persuade my wife ? " " Major Haines , I do n't consider those opinions are either proper or timely , and I 'll ask you to apply for transfer to some other regiment , " the General broke in . He turned in his saddle to the grim men behind him . " Gentlemen , it is to be understood that I made the compromise because I had no other choice . You will now take your posts , designating the captain of each company to make the explanation I have given . " He looked down at me without the least acknowledgement of our fellow humanity . " Mrs. Reeve , please leave the field through the East Gate so you wo n't encounter any troops . I 'll be grateful if you and the groom get out of their sight as quickly as possible . " I nodded my head . Manu bent very low as he held out his hand for my step into the saddle . We rode into the lonely emptiness of the field . We made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my reins to Manu . " I told you , Lola Memsahib , on the night of our first parting , that you must journey alone . " " I 'm not alone . " I went to my room , bathed , and put on a pretty dress of the kind my husband liked . I was waiting for him in the library when he returned . He came in quietly , a forlorn expression on his face , and , loosening the collar of his tunic , dropped into a chair opposite me . " Would you like tea ? " I asked . " If you please . " I touched the bell cord , and , when the tea was brought , I put in sugar and milk . He drained the cup and put it down . " Wo n't you have some , Lucia ? " he asked . " Not now , thank you , Anthony , "  | " Then we might as well get this over with . " He spoke wearily and in a kind tone . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General about resigning , and he asked me not to do so  --  anyway I did n't want to . If the Queen knew , I think she , too , would want me to stay . I have been a good officer , and I can serve her in no other way . " " That 's a fine thing , Anthony . " " Thank you , my dear . Now as to our separation  --  for we both realize it 's inevitable ? " He paused and I nodded . " I feel it would be much better if you would return to England , " he went on . " Of course , you can take Manu with you , if he wants to go . " Again I nodded . " What would you do there , Lucia ? " he asked . " You knew I once planned to go on the stage . I 'll do that if possible , and , of course , use a stage name . If I have to take other employment , I 'll use my maiden name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's any law against that , is there ? " " I think it would be better to call yourself Mrs. Lucia Reeve , which will imply separation . Unless , of course , you go on the stage . In that case I would prefer you use a stage name . " " Very well . " " Now this is more painful . You are a young woman with your life before you . It is nothing to me that I ca n't remarry , but it may prove a great sorrow to you , However , you 're not afraid of convention , and I do n't think you would hesitate to live with the man you love . I 'd not want you to hesitate  --  you are certainly entitled to love and be loved  --  one great innocent mistake should not deprive you of it . If it becomes known , I will , of course , appeal to the Ecclesiastical Court for a divorce a mensa et Coro . As you know , that does n't permit remarriage  --  no English divorce does  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common-law marriage , which under those conditions is regarded with a good deal of tolerance by the greater part of society . " " I wo n't oppose the suit , and I 'll let you know when it 's necessary . "  | " I appreciate that attitude very much . I 'll settle on you half of what I have ? " " No , I 'll make my own way . I have enough money for Manu and me to get to England and to keep us going several months . I have n't been a good wife to you . I tried and failed . All I want is a gift in token of forgiveness . Any little token you want to give me . " To my amazement he bowed his head in his hands and wept . I went to him and stroked his hair and kissed his cheek . Soon he regained his self-control . " I want to give you the scarf pin I wore on the day we met , " he said . " If you wish . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repay when you can in comfort ? I could n't stand for you to be in want . " " I 'll accept it gladly . " " Will you forgive me for every harsh word I 've ever spoken to you ? " My eyes filled with tears , and I nodded . " You 've never spoken one to me , " he went on . " You 've never been anything but lovely . You said you had n't been a good wife to me . Perhaps the reason you could n't be  --  I mean , my idea of a good wife  --  was my own lack of faith . I wanted to trust in you today ? " He stopped , to try to shape his words . I did not want them shaped . I wanted them blurted out . " Will you speak just as plainly as possible ? " I asked . " You just made a very puzzling statement . You said you wanted to trust in me today ? " " I was n't able to . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision . " " Trust in me to do  --  or not to do  --  what ? " I spoke quietly , in a calm tone , so not to interfere with his thoughts . " I meant trust your motives . I should 've  --  you are my wife ? instead I was like the others . You see , we 've all been trained the same . Dr. Haines did believe in you  --  maybe the Tommies did , as he said , until the wonder turned into a joke . Maybe we officers  --  we pukka sahibs  --  disbelieved as some sort of self-defense  --  in defense of  | what we stand for , blinded by our own dust . I 've never known such pride as rushed into my heart when I first saw you riding into the cannon . But there was a drop of poison in it that soon spread ? " " Pardon me , Anthony . You 're assuming that I understand something that I do n't . You said you did n't trust my motives . Do you mean  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you and the other officers thought I was trying to make trouble  --  that perhaps because my father was humbly born and I 'm so close to Manu that I hated the pukka sahibs and on a wild impulse took sides with the mutineers ? " " God , not It could n't cross our minds that you were a traitor . " " I do n't know that it would have been treason . This is their country , not ours . If I did it from love and not hate , you need n't have been ashamed . But none of you thought that . What did you think ? " " Oh , I assumed you knew ! I would n't have mentioned it again ? " My heart felt meager and useless , without strength to beat , but I looked my husband in the face and asked , " What did you think ? What was the drop of poison ? I 'm sure I know now , but will you say it in plain words ? " " We knew you pitied those men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That what I did was not for them , but to show off ? " " Partly . " " When he asked the question , I do n't think he said partly . " " He should have said self-dramatization . ' That was the doubt I felt . You 'd wanted to go on the stage ? " " Perhaps he was right . How do I know ? My mother always said I was a show-off . " " For God 's sake , do n't compare ? " " I wo n't . Mamma did n't want me to show off because she wanted all the attention herself . The General did n't want me to because it was bad for the Empire , and you did n't for that reason and because it shamed you . But it comes to the same thing , does n't it ? " " I told you that if I were capable of more faith ? " " You had faith in me the night you asked me to marry you . You  | did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? you said I was standing up for my own . I thought  --  I felt  --  I was standing up for my own today  --  my own human kind  --  but I dare say I was n't . I was only trying to attract attention . It 's a dreadful thing that God lets us fool ourselves in that humiliating way . I fooled both of us before  --  but this time I only fooled myself . " His eyes slowly rounded . " Am I the base Indian who threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe ? " " That 's only poetry . " " Lucia , if you 'll stay with me , I 'll resign my commission  --  we have enough to live on  --  and we 'll go to some new country ? " " I ca n't stay with you any longer . Not even tonight . You can tell the people that I had a touch of sunstroke while riding this morning ? that 's a better story than the other  --  I did n't know what I was doing when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start at once and put up at the first dak bungalow  --  there 's a fine moon and we 'll get there before midnight . It 's a very hot night  --  I could n't stand it and insisted on starting at once for the cool hills . You can send my baggage after me  --  my ayah can pack it  --  and a Company dooly , with orders to take me to Bombay . I 'm sorry for all the trouble I 've caused you . I wish you every happiness . " " Will you take the pin  --  and the loan ? " " Of course . I 'm not trying to hurt you . I 'm trying to help you . " " I 'm going to send a guard with you . " " I do n't need it , but it will look better . " " Look ! Look ! Is that all that 's left ? Not what I see , but what others may see ? Your eyes are dry . Wo n't you even cry ? " " My mother asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cry . " TWENTY  --  FIVE MID-AFTERNOON of the first day 's journey after the first night 's stop , the dooly-bearers stopped chanting of the joys of good food and faithful wives and sang a song about me . One after another made up a verse , then all joined in the refrain .  | The memsahib is a small memsahib , as memsahibs go ; She is not much taller and fatter than a Bengali virgin , That the rajah buys when he is old and feeble . Jog along , jog along , down the long road . Food and rest are waiting for us , Hail This morning she got out of the dooly and rode her horse , But we were fresh then , and hardly missed her burden . Tomorrow 1 hope she will ride in the afternoon . Jog along , jog along , down the long road . Food and rest are waiting for us , Hail What has the memsahib eaten since her breakfast ? It is more fattening than rice swimming in ghee ! She will not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , down the long road . Food and rest are waiting for us . Hai ! I will tell you what she has eaten . Bread made of lead ! But a horse is stronger than we are . Perhaps he would fall down If again she would spring on his back and ride . Jog along , jog along , down the long road . Food and rest are waiting for us . Hai ! I had them stop and put me down , and did my best to answer their broad grins . It was a poor attempt , for an hour was striking that I had waited for , in deep dread , all day . Both the scene and the time were as favorable as I could hope for . The lengthening shadows promised the first breach of the heat . The buffalos were lurching out of their wallows , soon to file back to the village . The countryside was completely Indian  --  a village in the distance shaded by tall palms ; a farmer coaxing impounded water into his thirsty field ; a pilgrim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust . I mounted my horse , and , when I had ridden well out of earshot of the dooly-bearers and the guard , waited for Maim to come up beside me . " Yea , memsahib ? " he said . " Did you think I had something to tell you ? " " I have known it all day . "  | " Do you know what it is ? " " I know it is in my kismet , and what good to go forth to meet it ? In its hour , it would surely come . " " Manu , Hind is my native land . I was not born here , true , but I remember no other , and I have made it mine by loving you , its son . " " Yea , truly . " " You have a wife and tall sons and grown daughters and grandchildren , all dwelling in Hind . But I have no one but you . My husband has cast me forth . With him , I lose the protection of Kubera and Ganesa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Shall I find Krishna again ? He gazes upon my dim eyes and into my bleak heart and will have naught of me . Now I set forth for the cold island . Once I thought he forsook his cowherdess playmates to visit its green moors , but then I was beautiful and young  --  I had seen but eighteen rains . Soon  --  in a few moons  --  I will have seen two and twenty rains . All who loved me save you are gone  --  Rene my lover , and the old General Sahib , and Kitty . The dancing-teacher memsahib and the old French knight and the music-player do not want me unless my heart is light . All I have won is gone  --  my gold and my izzat . So it has come upon me that I can not take you across the dark waters . " He rode in silence for a moment , not a trace of expression on his face . " Memsahib , hast thou ever seen the little piece of iron which sailors look at , to find their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A lascar had one and showed it to me and asked me which way it pointed . I told him to the south . Fool , ' he said , it points north . ' But , memsahib , that depended on which end of the little iron one judged by . Now it comes to me that all you have said  --  save that part concerning my loved ones  --  points not to my parting with you on the shore , but going on with you across the waters . " " Again , Manu , you are looking at the wrong end . You loved me with tenderness when you first cared for me . But you loved me in pride on the night that the boats caught fire on the river , and I did  | not run crying to your arms , but flung the burning brand into the water . Are you my servant ? " " Aye . " " Despite our hearts put in each other 's keeping ? " " Aye . My heart beats with thine , or leaps or falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shame your shame ? " " Aye , for I can love you without hating you the while . " " So could Rene , whereby I could not make a marriage with him . Manu , I have been cast down . It is no longer meet that you should serve me , until again I arise . You would be cheated , and I would be shamed . " " Memsahib , I rode with you into the cannon 's mouth . Do you not ride again into cannon ? " " Nay , I walk humbly , in great fear . A wheel has turned full circle , and again I am sent into exile . You would have gone with me before , if I had bid you , but I did not , although not knowing why save in my silent heart . Now the truth rises to my mind , where I may see it . Did you not tell me I must walk alone ? " " Aye . " " If you went with me , it would be a great cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who has drunk the cup of death . On the cold island there are few of your kind , with whom to sit at the rice bowl and to tell old tales , and to smoke and spit and be as brothers . There the sun in summer midday is not as warm as here at winter rising . It is a weak ' sun , half the time hidden behind clouds . The rains are chill , and the east wind bites to the bone . Yet if I could be your sun , I would bid you go there with me . If I could keep you warm with happiness and pride , I would wear you like a jewel on my hand . I can not now  --  I have been brought too low ? it may be I must again dwell in shadow as in dark days at Kelso . When the day comes that I can  --  and that day will come , if we both live  --  I will send word to my beloved servant to come to me . " " Your servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his face . " I will leave you enough rupees to pay your way under the deck of the great ship . I will write you every month in care of the Dak-  | khana in Patna . And from henceforth , until we say farewell beside the ship , we shall take no thought of our parting , and shed no tears , and look not to the past or to the future , but live for the day , the hour , and the moment , and see and hear and smell and touch all that we may , as when we journeyed together into Chota Nagpur . And you shall be happy in my love , and I will be happy in yours . " This last we achieved . We made boon companions of the doolybearers , and sang saucy songs to them in reply to their own . We would not put up with my homely Mahratta ayah 's weeping and wailing lest she never see Poona again , and frightened her into silence with spine-chilling charms . We forgot about time , traveling when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as we liked ; we went down byways out of the dust and dim paths through the forests ; we visited solemn temples and frivolous bazaars . We struck up friendships with Gypsies , holy men on pilgrimages , Marwaris with laden ponies , Mohammedan women dressed like goblins in absolute purdah , all but naked jungle men , plowmen in the fields , and girls coming up from the brooks with water jars on their heads . We looked , heard , smelled , and felt , without the darkening thought that together we would not pass this way again . At night we put up at dak bungalows when they were handy ; otherwise we stayed in native houses , our bedrolls spread on the floor . But I could not control the passage between my falling to sleep and waking again . Therein I was repeatedly warned not to confuse the holiday with the days of reckoning to come . I would be given this merrymaking with no penalty added on , if I had learned my lesson . That lesson was a relatively easy one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it only required me to pursue it in a sensible fashion . I was not to yield to my rash impulses . I must be temperate in all things . I must have more regard for appearances . I must not fly in the face of public opinion . When we arrived in Bombay , I found that I had missed the big Indiaman sailing around the Cape of Good Hope , and the next sailing was the Lord Clive , what the English tars called a " morphadite boat , " meaning one equipped with both sails and paddle wheels . She was one of the Company 's first ventures in steam , and was in  | disfavor with Anglo-Indians on account of her cramped quarters and sluggish pace . Her present voyage was one for comfort-loving travelers to shun . She would carry us only to Suez ; from there we must cross overland to Cairo on the Nile , descend the river to Alexandria , then take a Peninsular and Oriental Steamer to London . As a consequence , I was able to get a stateroom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desert . There were no other prospects , just now , that I cared to entertain . The ship was to sail on the tide just before midnight , recalling to me another sailing near that hour , and my parting with Rene . Manu and I had hoped the rains would break before our farewells were said  --  one of the reasons we had dawdled on the road was to await the good omen  --  but they had held off , and the sun glowered in red fury as it plunged into the sea . There was no breeze in our faces . The dock was thronged with people who might as well be enemies , since no Iook or word or gesture indicated they were friends . Manu could not go aboard with me because he wore no badge . We stood beside a white wall hot to the touch . " Will you forgive me for breaking faith ? " I asked . " I know not whether you have broken faith or kept it , because I know not who you are , nor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named for the Vedic hero ? Am I not Lola , named for the blacksmith ? " " I can not tell . I wander in a dream . " " Have I broken faith with Lola ? " " Nay , because she is gone . By that token , you have not broken faith with Manu . Manu found himself in Lola . He , too , became a hero , who rode into the flame to stand with the Rajput . Now that she is gone , he is only an old gardener of little wit . " " Will you remember me as I was , when we rode into the fire , ere the sahib lay me bare as a braggart ? " I asked . " Aye  --  and as you ran into the rain on the day of my return . " " Will you live on , taking joy in your loved ones , in good food , and rest after labor , and the company of your friends , and a pipe of refreshment ? " " You have quailed before Kali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and until then , neither you or I may die , even though stones be heaped upon us high as a tower . " " I can not believe it now . What we defied was only an image ot stone , painted black and red , with no power to slay . But to the law of the sahibs , that has power not only to slay but to rend the living heart , I will now make great offerings . Yet I would have you believe , when I can not , that we will again ride together into the flame . " " I will believe it , memsahib . " " Will you call me Lola ? " " Nay , I can not . My heart fails . " " Yet I speak to my servant Mann . The moons will wax and wane , and the rains will break and die away , and you shall labor in the gardens and take what joys come to your hand . Every month you shall go to the Dak-khana for my letter . I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose again , and on that day you shall take leave of your loved ones and give all your possessions to your heirs and say farewell to Hind . For you then will become a bairagi , setting forth on a pilgrimage never to return to your familiar scenes . To all you have known and loved , you shall be as one who has drunk the cup of death . " " Truly , I am your servant . " " You shall cross the dark waters without loss of caste , and in me you shall live again . That is my word that has gone forth from me , and if I break it , may you be shamed . " " There is even now a flush upon your face ? " " It will soon pale , like the flush of the sun in the sky , but it will return . Now put your hand in mine . " " See , it is strong again and trembles not . " " It was my will to kiss your mouth in farewell , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sacrifice . Even now they gaze at us , because you stand beside me instead of behind me , and there be tears in both our eyes . But this hand that was ever raised for me  --  that I will kiss in token of our bond . " It did not matter that two or three sahibs and memsahibs saw me do it . They thought their eyes had tricked them .
