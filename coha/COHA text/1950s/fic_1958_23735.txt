HAPPY MARRIAGE A Story by JOYCE CARY Drawings by Alan Cober S AMUEL THOMPSON , civil servant , was the only child of Athenia.Battersby , the famous feminist leader . She is said to have been the original inventor of the plan for burning letter boxes . She designed the suffrage hat , and wrote a book proving that Shakespeare was Queen Elizabeth . But it is a shame for the modern generation of women to laugh at Athenia . They owe her a big debt . She ' had courage and character , she really did a great deal to get them votes and sacrificed much of herself in the process , fur instance , her sense of humor . She forbade marriage to her followers , as a degradation , but after women 's votes were granted , she married Sandy Thompson , a feminist as enthusiastic as herself , and taught him to cook ; in fact , made him into a modem husband thirty years before his time . He would do the washing up while she dashed out to meetings . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the washing up , and learned sewing . He was a man of pugnacious temperament who loved any excuse for a fight . If he had not been brought up a Christian pacifist hewould have made a first-class thug . As an organizer of suffrage demonstrations he loved to bash policemen , and he hemmed dusters to show how much he considered women a superior sex . Their marriage was very happy in its own way . But dedicated parents are bad for children , whose imaginations , like their bodies , can not bear to remain fixed in any one position . ' Samuel had an austere upbringing  --  both parents taught him from his earliest years that boys were little better than the brutes . But , as friends later pointed out to him , he had no right to complain of anything , he was lucky to exist at all and had almost certainly been an accident . Athenia was even more against motherhood  --  at least for feminist pioneers  --  than marriage . She held that responsible educated women should devote themselves to the professions , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Samuel took the point and was humbly grateful for life , such as it was . He grew up a modest and retiring character . Even at his office in the Ministry of Energy he was hardly known , except as a signature , by anyone outside his own staff . He belonged to no clubs and played no games except patience . His hobby ) nras collecting stamps , but he also took an absorbed interest in the latest scientific developments , as ' recorded in his morning paper , an old liberal daily which , by tradition , gave at least half a column a week to general culture . The theory of the expanding universe occupied him for months and drove his acquaint-antes distracted . He was also extremely concerned about nuclear physics and the possibility of the disappearance of the world one morning owing to an accident at the Harwell laboratories . He especially avoided the company of women ; he appeared a confirmed old bachelor . But at forty-six , to everyone 's astonishment , he fell in love with one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very smart young woman direct from college and right up-to-date . She condescended to Picasso and was completely bored with the subject of homosexuality . She wore a Victorian cameo in her hat and had two fine drawings by Millais in her flat . The wedding was in church . Aminta was a keen churchwoman . This was slightly embarrassing to Samuel who had never even been baptized . His mother had strong views about religion . As a scientist she called it nonsense , and as a feminist a man-made device for the subjection of women . But Aminta pushed him through the service and he did not disgrace himself . They settled in a charming little villa at Kew , Ruskin Gothic , and furnished it with some good mid-Victorian mahogany . Aminta was lucky enough to find a Clarkson Stanfield sea picture in a junk shop and to get it for ten pounds . This fine work gave great distinction to their sitting-room . Aminta 's treasure was a gilt clock under an original glass dome , which required and received a draped mantelpiece . A MINTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find he has n't any . She has dozens of both sexes and all ages , especially friends from college . All these young women are in jobs or just married or both . They arrive every day to see Aminta , bringing small babies or bottles of claret . All of them want to see Samuel , and gaze curiously at him , tell him that Aminta will make a very good wife in spite of her intelligence , and when they go away say to each other , like all friends of a new-married person , " But how extraordinary  --  how on earth did it happen  --  can it last ? " suspect that their dear but reckless has acquired Samuel as a collector 's any make of car , mend linen , put in a fuse , do running repairs on household gadgets , choose , store , and decant a respectable wine , and pick a smokable cigar at a smokable price . As for children , they all want six apiece and take the view that if any child does not turn out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be entirely to blame . When Samuel dares to murmur that there can be bad fathers , they gaze at him for a moment and then say that no doubt mothers sometimes make that excuse , but it 's not really an excuse . They obviously think that any woman ought to be able to cope with any kind of man , including the worst of fathers . " Cope " is their great word . They are polite to Samuel but they do n't take him very seriously . When he raises the question of the expanding universe one evening , he is assured by two girls at once , of whom one has taken a first class in mathematics and is a fellow of her college , that it is a stunt for the tabloids . The universe , they say , can be made to dance the polka with a suitable equation ; it depends only on which system . you use . The mathematician , who is in the eighth month of her second child , then returns to the subject of lyings-in . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital ? Either way things can go wrong , and then the party discusses some cases that have gone wrong , with the technical elaboration of experts . It is , for instance , quite wrong to suppose that the widest hips are a guarantee of safety . Samuel listens with horror , and breaks into cold sweats . Aminta is small , with an eighteen waist and hips of that rare type that look slim even in jeans . Aminta , after two months of marriage , is already expecting . She has been decided on six children from the age of ten . She too has had a feminist mother . Samuel mutters in his sleep and wakes up with a moan . Next day he begins to flutter about Aminta like a nervous hen . She must not lift that chair , she must not use her arms , she must not run on the stairs , she must not go out this morning , it is too hot or too cold . Aminta laughs at him and obeys till he has gone to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles on painless childbirth , and Samuel rushes out at once to buy all the hooks . Aminta is commanded to do exercises , to learn how to relax . And she obeys . For Aminta herself has been a little apprehensive , even if she says nothing about it . What girl does n't have some anxiety in her first pregnancy ? Aminta had lost her parents young and her family was small and scattered , Service people . A naval cousin dropped in from Hong Kong one day with a real Chinese jar of the genuine ginger . An elder sister , an Anglican nun , brought her an original Negro carving from Central Africa . A great-aunt from the Midlands , who had sent as a wedding present a plated snuffineer dating from her own wedding , asked herself for a week because , as she explained , she could stand anything except modern hotels . S H E was a little thin woman of seventy-six with the complexion of a sea captain . Her nose was Atlantic blue , a dark fierce blue like the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a cabin door . Her forehead in a sharp line above her eyebrows was dead white like that of an old sailor . But she had not the suave and ingratiating manner of the liner captain ; she was bluff and gruff . She had got her complexion from sixty years in the hunting field where she had made a distinguished career as the first woman M.F.H. , at least of a smart pack . Even in town she wore the mannish dress affected by pioneer women of the late ' eighties ; a Tyrol felt , a double-breasted reefer , a man 's hard collar and four-in-hand tie . She was amazed and disgusted by the furniture , especially the gilt clock and the draped chimney board . " Good God , " she said , " just like my granny 's , and she was a stuffy old relic even for Dawlish . All that dusty rubbish went out with mustache cups . " She thought the Stanfield equally out of date . She herself possessed a seascape , a Boudin . " But of course , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She brought a brace of pheasants and two bottles of port , Croft ' 26 . She instructed Aminta to cook the pheasants , an anxious job for so particular a gourmet , but she allowed no one but herself to decant the port . And over a second glass that evening , she unbent so far as to say she could forgive Samuel everything but his mother . " My God , " she said , " what a disaster  --  that vote . When I was young , women ran the civilized world , let 's say , France down to Longchamp and England up to Newmarket , but they do n't run anything now except these ridiculous nylons . My generation were people ; we knew how to make ourselves respected , but you girls are just a sex . Look at the advertisements . " When she heard of Aminta 's relaxing exercises , she snorted , " There you are  --  just what I said  --  as if women were all the same size and shape , just lumps of sex stamped out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same frills . " She poured and savored her third glass , accepted a cigar , glanced at the name on the box , said , " How do you afford Havanas ? You young people nowadays spoil yourselves . " " They were for you , " said Aminta . " I thought so , " said she , with the grins smile of an M.F.H. " Getting round the old fool on her weak side . " Suddenly she became extraordinarily genial , in the way of so many gruff old people who seem astonished and overwhelmed at the least mark of affection . Probably the old woman paid for her local glory in loneliness . All at once she could n't do too much for her dear Aminta and Sammy . She would send them game every week and her own recipe for bread sauce . She would order a dozen of burgundy at once  --  that was the stuff for breeding gals , nothing like it to make blood . As for the lying-in , there was only one man in England  --  one that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's delivered all the Hunt children for forty years and he 's set my collarbone five times . He 's been retired since the war but he 'd do / anything for me . I 'll bring him up at once to Iook- over the ground . " And she wired next morning . She belonged to the generation before ' phones . Samuel swore that no Blankshire bone-setter should come near his Aminta . But Dr. McMurdo came next day . It was apparently true that he would do anything for a lady so distinguished in history as Aminta 's aunt . He was also in his seventies , an enormous man with a huge round purple face and a great swag belly . He was dressed in a shaggy yellow tweed with a four-inch blue check and a duster-pattern white flannel waistcoat . He ate and drank with the gusto of a Falstaff . To see him at table would have been an inspiration to Stratford . He too was an authority on port , and his manner with the patient was less fatherly than familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behind after his examination , but it was more than a pat . When she talked about her relaxing exercises and painless childbirth , he grinned like a satyr and answered with more affectionate pats , " Leave it to me , me dear . That 's what I 'm here for . Just leave it all to me and relax . " Arid he winked at Thompson  --  a wink combining all the genial villainy of a Falstaff with all the cynicism , as Thompson put it , of an abortionist . And as soon as Aminta had her first real pain out came the chloroform mask . She knew nothing more till she waked up feeling beautifully flat , and heard , as in the far distance , a baby crying somewhere , and gradually realized that this was her baby . A F TER that it somehow came about that McMurdo attended also for the other two children . They are brought up in the new style , to mind their manners , and get up when their papa comes to table  --  just as Aminta promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head and supports the authority of the father . The result is that when she threatens them , " 1 ' 11 tell Papa , " they become instantly as good as gold amenable as lambs . They are happy , lively , reasonable ; they have no moral problems always know what is the right thing to do even when they do n't mean to do it . The Thompson family in short is a very happy one  --  Aminta 's friends who assured Samuel that her intelligence would not prevent her from making a success of marriage were right . Samuel adores her . Their only subject of occasional difference is the vote . As a son of his mother he thinks Aminta takes the vote too lightly . Not that she despises it . " Of course it 's a thing MAGAZINE one has to have , " she says , " like mumps . But why do they always have elections on wet days and put the polling booths in back yards among municipal dustbins . And what do votes do after all ? " Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of the house it is noticed that she runs everything ; looks after all the money , pays all bills  --  even at Samuel 's new croquet club ? drives the car , and chooses the family holiday . What 's more , when , in that frantic fortnight before Budget Day , Samuel , like all senior government clerks , brings back memos in the evening and even for the Sunday , she will sit- down and knock up a quite masterly report on the Calorific Value of Brick Dust , or the Profitable Utilization of Factory Smoke . They are a happy couple and in this happiness Samuel has blossomed in a late florescence . He has given up stamps and collects glass paperweights . He wears a bowler and fancy waistcoats . His trousers grow narrower and narrower . He says that nowadays there is so little difference between political parties that old liberals like himself might as well vote blindfold . And last election he very nearly did vote Conservative . The only reason why he refrained at the last moment was because he discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has become a devoted Churchman with a leaning to evangelism . In short , he is very nearly a new man .
