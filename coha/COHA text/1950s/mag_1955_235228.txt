In colonial Kenya , the best farmlands are the Highlands , known as the White Highlands because only white settlers are permitted to own land there . Forty-three thousand whites share about 12,000 sq . mi. of the Highlands , while the colony 's 5,300,000 Africans are crowded into 52,000 sq . mi. of less desirable farmlands down below , or scrabble for their living in the arid , underdeveloped " Crown Lands " -a euphemism for wilderness . For many years the million-strong Kikuyu tribe , less uneducated than most and peacefully inclined , talked hopefully of expanding their holdings into the White Highlands ; instead , the white settlers told them to go expand into the Crown Lands , and vaguely talked of irrigation projects that would some day make the Crown Lands bloom . Frustrated , many of the Kikuyu farmers turned to other occupations , including joining the Mau Mau and beheading whites . <P> Two years ago , Britain 's Tory government , while busy fighting off the Mau Mau , appointed a Royal Commission to take a long , slow look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughgoing , 482-page report , the Royal Commission made one overriding recommendation : the White Highlands must be opened up to African ownership , and African land ghettoes must be done away with . As for the Africans , the commission urged them to drop their old ways of tribal land ownership , and to switch to individual or family land ownership . <P> Considering that the Mau Mau shooting war is still on , and that Kenya 's black v. white feeling runs high , the Royal Commission 's report had a Utopian and distant sound about it . The diehard majority of British settlers is sure to oppose it , and to try to sabotage any attempt at implementation ; the settlers can say , with reason , that conditions for peaceful transfer of land between races do not now exist . But some day soon in darkest East Africa , a start must somehow be made ; something new must be offered the Africans in place of blood-cults and drums , prejudice and pangas flashing in the night .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
