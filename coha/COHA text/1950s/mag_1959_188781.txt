Making up for eight weeks spent in the hospital recovering from an assassin 's bullets , Iraq 's Premier Karim Kassem turned to unfinished business . In his headquarters inside Baghdad 's ugly yellow brick Defense Ministry , he put seven committees to work on crash programs , one reorganizing the army ( and negotiating with Moscow for arms ) , a second restudying Iraq 's foreign policy , another drafting a new constitution , a fourth drawing up an electoral law to regulate the long-promised return of " normal " political activity on Jan. 6 . By that date Kassem himself hopes to reassert his position as " sole leader " dominating the political parties . <P> The one Iraqi party that supports Kassem 's home and foreign policies without giving allegiance either to Cairo or to Moscow is the National Democratic Party . Since last summer the National Democrats have been fighting a fierce battle with the Communists for the loyalties of Iraqi farmers . The Communists won the first skirmish by getting a Redlined onetime hospital orderly elected to the presidency of the National Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peasants Federation . Last week , in defiance of the Federation , the National Democrats led more than 100,000 Iraqi farmers and peasants past the Defense Ministry in a five-hour parade celebrating Kassem 's recovery . Obviously much more wary of assassination than before , Kassem kept well away from the crowds as he appeared briefly on a platform to answer cheers . But if he needed reassurance that non-Communist support for him exists in his dispirited country if he invokes it , the marching farmers provided it .
