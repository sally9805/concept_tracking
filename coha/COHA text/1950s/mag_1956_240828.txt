Dr. Werner Forssmann was young ( 25 ) and eager to prove the worth of a revolutionary idea : that it should be possible to learn more about the inside of a diseased human heart by inserting a thin rubber tube ( catheter ) into it . But none of his hospital colleagues in Eberswalde , near Berlin , was willing to be a guinea pig . Suspecting the gleam in young Forssmann 's eyes , the chief surgeon even forbade his experimenting on himself . Secretly one night Dr. Forssmann punctured a vein in his arm and persuaded a fellow resident to start working a tube into it . With little more than i ft. inserted , the friend quit , protesting that it was too dangerous . A week later , with no helper other than a nurse holding a mirror so that he could watch the tube 's progress on a fluoroscope , Forssmann tried again and got 25-inches of tube through his elbow vein . <P> <P> With the tube in place , Dr. Forssmann climbed two flights of stairs to the X-ray room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic proof that its tip had entered the right side of his heart . The technique , he reported in a learned paper in 1929 , would be valuable for studying the blood pressure inside the heart , and for injecting radiopaque dyes to get X rays of the heart , including abnormalities . But his discovery was ignored in Germany . Older men , who should have been wiser , scoffed at Forssmann 's catheterization of the heart as a circus stunt . Beginning in the early ' 30s two Columbia University researchers , Dr. Dickinson W. Richards and French-born Dr. Andre Cournand , read of Forssmann 's experiment and developed a way to use it both for research and diagnosis . They showed that it could be used in studies of shock , in revealing defects inside the heart or abnormal connections between arteries . Conditions that formerly were invariably fatal could be detected and corrected by surgery . <P> Driven from research by the skepticism of his German colleagues , Dr. Forssmann took up surgery . He was captured during the war . Since his release from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lumberjack , he has been supporting his wife and six children as a general practitioner in the little town of Bad Kreuznach in Rhine province . Last week he learned that Stockholm 's Caroline Medico-Surgical Institute , only 27 years behind the times , had named him , together with Richards and Cournand , to share the 1956 Nobel Prize for medicine ( $38,633 ) . Said the German country doctor : " I feel like a village pastor who is suddenly informed that he has been made a cardinal . "
