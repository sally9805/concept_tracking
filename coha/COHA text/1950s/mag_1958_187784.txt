With a scholar 's pride former Dean Lawrence Chamberlain of Columbia College listed his school 's most serious purpose : to assure " a small but steady flow of superior young men into our graduate schools . " Then , in his final report to Columbia University President Grayson Kirk , released last week , Teacher Chamberlain , 52 , detailed two courses that the college might follow in the next decade : 1 ) to aim for continuity , preserve in the college the same standards and values it has now ; 2 ) to stiffen entrance requirements drastically , and insist that incoming freshmen possess much of the knowledge that now must be fed to them in time-devouring basic courses . <P> Chamberlain 's choice is clear : the first alternative is " wholly legitimate and undoubtedly attainable . There is no reason to believe that Columbia can not follow this course and prosper . " But the second , he states bluntly , offers Columbia " the opportunity of becoming the most distinctive and , if successful , the most distinguished undergraduate college in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top half of the 2,400 students now in the college would qualify for admission under the proposed system . Says Educator Chamberlain : " Preference should be given to the applicant who has completed , prior to entrance , four years of mathematics and science , who can read a foreign language , and whose command of English is demonstrated . . . These courses can be efficiently taught and learned in secondary school , and the time of the college student can be used more profitably on other subjects if he enters college already capable of handling these basic subjects and skills . <P> " If admission to the better colleges , including Columbia , came to be limited to students whose secondary-school preparation included these stepped-up requirements , it would not be very long until schools , parents and students accepted and adjusted to them . College work could then begin at a genuinely ' higher educational ' level , with corresponding upgrading throughout the entire four years . "                   @ @
