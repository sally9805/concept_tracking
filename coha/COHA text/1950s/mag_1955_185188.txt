Years of frustrated desires and months of delicate negotiations were concealed in a few paragraphs of turgid prose that lay before the eleven diplomats of the U.N . Security Council one day last week . Its title was Draft Resolution Doc . S-3502 . Its fate rested with one man who sat , sad and misleadingly tranquil , behind the name plate of China . <P> Would Nationalist China defy the wishes of the majority of the U.N . General Assembly and use its Great Power veto to keep Outer Mongolia out of the U.N.-and with it 17 other countries ? * Or had the threats of its many enemies and the pleas of its few friends persuaded Nationalist China to soften its opposition to a bargain the rest of the world had tentatively struck with the Communists ? Blinking like a mournful owl from behind his glasses . Nationalist Delegate T. F. Tsiang slowly delivered the Nationalists ' answer . " The peoples all over the world expect the United Nations to stand by its principles , " he said . " When you base a proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . you are destroying that very moral prestige of the United Nations . " Tsiang paused . " This is a difficult moment for me , " he said , then in German repeated Martin Luther 's defiant apology to the Reichstag in Worms in 1521 : " I can not do otherwise . " <P> The Universal Theory . The sticking point , so far as the Chinese Nationalists were concerned , was the Russian insistence on Outer Mongolia , a Soviet puppet state carved out of the northern part of old China , and with few , if any , outward appearances of nationhood . <P> The Nationalists had been unmoved by the reminder that they themselves , back in the early post-Yalta days of 1946 , were among the first and one of the few to recognize Outer Mongolian sovereignty . They had been equally unmoved by the surprisingly candid statement of Australia 's Sir Percy Spender : " It is not principle with which we are concerned here but expedience-the expediency of inexorable political circumstances . " They also had been unmoved by two personal appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of " universality " of U.N . membership. * But to the Nationalists , the logic of " universality " had nothing to do with fractions of Russia . And furthermore it might lead to the seating of Communist China . <P> In the next 20 minutes , the longest fusillade of vetoes in the U.N . ' s veto-pocked history rent the Security Council . Tsiang , as promised , used China 's veto for the first time . He vetoed Outer Mongolia . Russia 's Arkady Sobolev , as he had warned , sprayed 15 vetoes at non-Communist candidates ( including two , South Korea and South Viet Nam , proposed only by Tsiang ) .
