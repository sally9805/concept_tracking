The popular picture of General Eisenhower is that of the professional soldier who happens =- ? atypically ? to possess some ingratiating human qualities and who , as a . patriotic duty in the hour of the - nation 's peril , has painfully acquired the necessary know-how to function Y as President , but a soldier first and foremost , trained at West Point and the Army War:College , steeled in , combat and generalship in two world wars , and disorbited from the military tradition and , discipline only by an v even sterner necessity . General-Eisenhower himself does nothing to correct this impression ; at his press conference he , often refers to-his military career . The picture is , nevertheless , almost entirely fictional . The General did go to West Point and no , doubt his heart still warms to the Academy 's - football teams . He did wear the univ form for over forty years . But , through no fault of his , he never led troops . in combat ; in the First World War he was never sent overseas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his political acumen and tact which accounted for his success in the almost impossible role of a coalition commander . To his good fortune , he lacks some of the outward qualities of the professional politician ? the unction and the rolling periods ? but these are , superficialities . The essentials , certainly , he has . They have stood him in good stead on his triumphal tour of half the world , and especially in India . Robert T. Hartmann , chief Of the Washington bureau of the Los Angeles Times , cabled from New Delhi on December 10 that the President 's ' address to the Indian Parliament was " a mine field of eloquent subtleties delivered by a man of plain and direct speech . " Hartmann remarks that the White House speech writers , Malcolm Moos and Kevin , McCann , had been working on the address for weeks and it was " a masterpiece delicately attuned to Indian ears . " The fact that the speech was ghostwritten has nothing to do with the case .

The art of the ghost , writer is to say what his client wants to say better than he could say it by himself , and yet in the verbal style befitting the man . Moos and McCann ' had no trouble on thiS score ; they have had plenty of experience . In New Delhi , the President and his scribes avoided every pitfall and latched onto every opportunity . Where John Foster Dulles had characterized the Indian neutrality policy as ' immoral , Mr. Eisenhower referred to India as " a triumph that offsets the world 's failures of the'past decade . " He did not fail to refer to " an alien philosophy backed by great military ' strength , " but neither dine lay hands on the Indians ' and try to drag them into the Allied camp . Moreover , it was the President 's Camp David conversations with Premier Khiushchey which enabled the Indian 's to without move . closer to the United States without laying themselves open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Robert A. Taft was quite right when he spoke in his posthumously published memorandum of the Wall Street interests which maneuvered General Eisenhower 's nomination for the Presidency . But if Senator Taft were alive today , he might be inclined to add a postscript : ' the man the interests chose was no mean politician and , under the en cumstances of the cold war , the choice of a politician with a military record showed considerable political acumen on the part of the choosers ' themselves . This was all to the good , since under our system a bad politician is bound to ' make a bad President . It is a commentary on our mass media , which are always on the lookout for the unsuspected and sensational , that in this instance they missed the plain reality beneath the superficial appearance . I Repudiate Your Resolution , ' Buster " Buster " was Neil E. Wetterman , Americanism chairman of the Hamilton County ( Cincinnati ) Council of the American Legion , and the man who applied the curiously apt epithet was Stephen M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a fratricidal quarrel , for Senator Young is himself a member of the American Legion , having served in both World Wars . He was in the House of Representatives for eight years before he defeated the long-term Republican incumbent , John W. Bricker , in 1958 . The occasion for Buster taking Senator Young to task was the Senator 's undertaking , a speak-mg date at a dinner of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee , of which Harvey O'Connor is chairman and Corliss Lamont is vice chairman . Since the American Legion claims 2,750,000 members , holders of political office are understandably chary of giving it offense . As everyone knows , also , the Legion has numerous councils , committees and functionaries who take offense easily . In this case Buster and his colleagues tore their garments and sprinkled ashes on their hair because the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee had referred to the E.C.L.C. as a Communist-front organization . So far , everything had gone according to precedent and , also according to precedent , Senator Young should have contritely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected a resolution passed by the Hamilton County Legion Council forbidding him to speak , but also Buster 's " pompous , self-righteous , holier-than-thou title of ' Americanism chairman . ' " He inquired whether " you self-appointed vigilantes demand that I submit a list of speaking engagements for clearance by your outfit before I , as a Senator of the United States , open my mouth in public ? " At the E.C.L.C. dinner , Senator Young-continued to voice heresies . He suggested that though the country had recovered somewhat from the era of " McCarthyism , " it might take a generation to remove all the " rubbish . " He referred to Representative Gordon H. Scherer , a member of the House Committee on Un-American Activities , as a self-proclaimed super-duper America Firster and vigilante . " He denounced Communists , Fascists , the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce . Worst of all , he declared that every American has the right to hold whatever political opinions he chooses ? and to express them . If this defiance of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt may be cleared away faster than Senator Young anticipates . Petition Now that the Supreme Court has denied Caryl Chessman 's appeal , the case will shortly be back in the lap of Governor Brown of California for final disposition . Last October 17 , in these columns , we pointed out that , other considerations aside , to execute Chessman after he has spent ten years in death row and been sentenced to die seven time 's would constitute an act of bloodthirstiness unusual even for these gory times . But we would like to deal here with the issue that now confronts the Governor . On the one hand , both he and Attorney General Mosk are on record as personally opposed to capital 478 punishment ; on the other , the laws of the state call for it , and the state legislature has refused to abolish the death penalty in the face of many demands . Both men , therefore , are in the unhappy position of having to determine the point at which their public duty must prevail over their private convictions . Under normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official , loyalty to law must always prevail . But in this instance , there is a choice ; clemency remains a gubernatorial prerogative . It is clear that , in their handling of the case so far , neither the Governor nor the Attorney General has been motivated by a sense of expediency or political advantage . Indeed , it may be said that if political advantage exists , it is probably to be found for both in saving Chessman from the gas chamber . And it is this final point which makes the choice so difficult for conscientious public servants like the Governor and the Attorney General . But conscientiousness is one thing : conscience another . And as friends and admirers of both men , we say to them : " Do not be captives of your principles as public servants ; do not fail to do the decent , humane thing simply because it may also be the expedient thing . Do not blight the promise of a brilliant administration by permitting a sentence to be carried out that is abhorrent to both of you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of conscience like ' yourselves yield to the senseless clamor of those who are afraid to live in a world without gallows . We are convinced that , if you listen to the ' better angels ' of your natures , Chessman will not die ? and only the vengeful and the frightened will deny that you have thereby reconciled your private views and public responsibilities in a manner that promises most for the future of our society . " The Research Fetish The drug industry , accused by Senator Estes Kefauver 's Anti-Trust and Monopoly Subcommittee of setting and administering excessive prices , states that last year it spent $170 million on " research " and this year $190 million . For an examination of the drug-price problem , see page 4791 It may be that the research referred to incorporated the quintessence of wisdom and will benefit the human race incalculably , but to be assured of this we should have to break down the figures into categories indicating who did what , for what purpose , and with what results . In a paper on " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David Novick of the Cost Analysis Department of the Rand Corporation implies that , even in the glorious noonday of R &D,; all is not gold that glitters . For instance , out of $185 million for R &D; in the Westinghouse Electric 1959 budget , 79 per cent went for " development of equipment to customers ' orders . " Not much of this outT he NATION lay of almost $148 million could have gone to breaking the barriers of new knowledge . Dr. Novick suggests that the figure " commonly bandied about " for 1959 R &D,; $10 billion , may not be a significant measure of national effort in the acquisition of new knowledge . The figure itself is statistically suspect , and inferences drawn from it are doubly suspect because of ambiguity of terms . In an effort to get some clarity into the situation , Novick offers four steps or classifications in R &D.; Step I is basic or experimental research with the objective of increased understanding of the universe and better organization of knowledge . Step II comprises applied research with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for utilizing the general knowledge accruing from Step I. Step III is concerned with product development , testing , evaluation and pilot-production when " do-ability " has been established . Step IV is production application research , applied testing and evaluation in which " new uses and applications or modifications of uses are sought for existing methods , products , or components . " ( Italics added. ) - Step III obviously presents something of a jump from Step II , while Step IV may conceivably be concerned with activities which are not research as the public understands it . How much of our $10 billion , then , is going into each of these categories , sequentially removed from the divine afflatus of an Einstein , Newton or Darwin ? No one knows , but Novick is willing to take a stab at it . Since he is the only one who has raised the question in this form , his answer deserves respectful consideration : Step Promise Guessed distitbntioa I Brave New World $ 100,000,000 II Possible use of new discovery 300,000,000 III Application of new knowledge . 2,600,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " writes Dr. Novick , " that something like $400 million is what we now are putting into the search for new knowledge with dramatic and exciting implications , and adjusting- this for price change and Big Wheel and Big Deal administrative practices , a basic question is raised as to how Much more we really are doing now than we were ten or twenty years ago . " We certainly are doing more selling . Well and good , but before we boast of the lavish expenditures of our great corporations for R &D,; we had better find out whether most of it is n't just that ? selling . Ethical Drugs and . Medical Ethics .. by David I , : Cowen THE MANUFACTURERS of ethical pharmaceuticals ( that is , drugs not advertised to the layman and for sale only upon the prescription or original recommendation of the physician ) have been under fire for some time now . Consumers ' groups , sections of the lay press and individual physicians and pharmacists have been asking questions and making accusations . The government has joined the war  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture that opened pricing and marketing activities to the public gaze , and more recently in a criminal anti-trust suit against the manufacturers of Salk vaccine . The latter , the first real battle , was won by the industry , the court finding that the government , being required to prove guilt " on a reasonable hypothesis beyond a reasonable doubt " and to " simultaneDAVID L. COWEN , ' who teaches history at Rutgers University , has long been interested in the special history of pharmacy . Dec ' ember 26 , 1959 ously eliminate every other reasonable hypothesis of innocence , " had presented evidence that established only the latter . The current Kefauver hearings are the next battle . Presumably interested in the broad problem of administered prices , the hearings have alleged and will continue to allege high prices and exorbitant profits , restricted supply and dumping at low prices in foreign markets , and will suggest a strain upon , if not violation of , the anti-trust laws . It is now too early to predict what the results of the investigation will be : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions , or further investigations may follow . Whatever happens , the pitiless publicity of the Kefauver hearings must redound to the advantage of the consumer . The consumer , who is concerned of course with the high price of ethical drugs , is at first ready to blame the pharmacist , but the latter rejects the basic responsibility . With considerable justice , he points to the high prices he needs to pay ; to the large inventories and senseless duplications he must keep ; and to the rapid obsolescence of drugs not always returnable . He contends that on well over half the prescriptions he sells he is just meeting his costs of materials , labor and overhead ; experts in pharmacy administration keep telling him that to these he should add a charge for professional services . Without question , the actual dollar margin on the higher-price prescriptions is large ; undoubtedly there are instances of gouging and shady practices . But the basic sources of consumer costs are the controlled prices and marketing practices of the manufacturers . WHETHER or not one accepts this rationalization completely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation at the consumer level is to deal only with the symptoms .
