Back to School <P> <P> Sir : <P> The latest outbursts of racial violence in the South have filled me with shame and disgust . This mob violence and mass hysteria has no justification and to poison the minds of children with hatred and bigotry is nothing less than atrocious ! Instead of hanging effigies , these mobs should hang their heads in shame . <P> LAURIE LORM <P> Dallas <P> <P> Sir : <P> Now that school is starting again , and little kids all over the world will be studying about our great American democracy , would n't it be a kind gesture for Congress to add an asterisk to that phrase about Liberty , Equality and Justice for all saying : " Except Negroes " ? It would do so much to help relieve all the confusion and doubt the world over about our being a nation of hypocrites . <P> LEWIS J. STOFFER <P> Cincinnati <P> <P> Judgments &; Prophecies <P> <P> Sir : <P> I have never heard of Murray Kempton of the New York Post before , and if it is humanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial on Vice President Nixon in your Sept. 3 issue is about the most crude and pointless piece of writing it has been my misfortune to read . Mr. Kempton is frantically groping to find a point on which to criticize when he must resort to making vulgar and sneering remarks on the Vice President 's dress . Constructive criticism is good for everyone , but Murray Kempton 's ill-chosen words are offensive and insulting to every decent-minded American , whether he be Democrat or Republican . <P> JILL WAKEMAN <P> Hillsborough , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Running David Lawrence 's item immediately following Murray Kempton 's was extremely efficacious . Kempton 's article , which is typical of the absurd and insubstantial material utilized as verbal bombast against Nixon , adequately proves Lawrence 's contention that the renomination of Nixon was a vindication of the Vice President over the long " whispering campaign about his lack of integrity " . The Democrats , not unlike the Communist propagandists in their techniques of unfactual and slanderous invective against Nixon , have yet to provide evidence from which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORRY J. BAIER <P> Honolulu <P> <P> Sir : <P> Kempton 's scurrilous remarks spur me on to campaign even harder for Vice President Nixon 's re-election this fall . <P> JANET STARR <P> San Diego , Calif . <P> <P> Tennessee Foist <P> <P> Sir : <P> How long , O Tennessee , will you foist upon the other 47 such as Estes and Frankie Clement ? <P> LILLIAN ROUNTREE <P> Lubbock , Texas <P> <P> Sir : <P> The neatest dismissal of the keynote speech at the Democrat Convention was made from the pulpit by a Jacksonville minister , who said : " Mr. Clement has slain the Republican Party with the jawbone of an ass .
