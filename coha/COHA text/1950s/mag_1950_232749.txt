Let us walk honestly , as in the day , not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness . . . <P> <P> It may be that celebration of the Christian Christmas in the U.S. is coming more &; more to resemble the pagan behavior that St. Paul warned against in his letter to the Romans . Last week , from pulpits across the nation , came warnings that holiday **25;13686;TOOLONG office parties-are getting out of hand . <P> In Manhattan , Roman Catholic Bishop Joseph F. Flannelly issued an admonition to be read at each of the seven Sunday Masses in St. Patrick 's Cathedral : " We note with alarm and regret the growing custom of holding parties in business offices on the days immediately preceding Christmas . We caution the faithful against such parties for the following reasons : 1 ) these parties ignore the sacred character of Advent , which is a time of becoming preparation for the coming of our divine Savior ; 2 ) the days immediately preceding Christmas are invariably days of fast and abstinence . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive use of intoxicating drinks . These sinful excesses cause untold harm in various ways to the participants and their families . They corrupt the morals and lower the morale of the community and the nation . " <P> In Chicago , Presbyterian Dr. Harrison Ray Anderson appealed to his congregation " to correct an abuse which has developed at Christmas time . . . The Christmas party in offices and homes has in some places developed into a shocking situation ... Is not this year , with its tragic happenings , the time to ... substitute another kind of party more in keeping with the birth of the Savior ? " Methodist Pastor Charles Ray Goff , a fellow Chicagoan , condemned what he called " heavy-drinking office parties . Office staff members , " he said , " are caught with their guards down ; they do not want to take part in the drinking , but are dragged in ... Last Christmas I saw four girls come out of an office building and go reeling down the sidewalk so intoxicated they could hardly stand . None could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful sight . I hope employers will look into this practice and try to devise some more appropriate kind of party . " <P> The Ministerial Association of Greater Cincinnati urged employers " to place first in their plans for yuletide parties the rightful emphasis upon the religious significance of the holiday . " And the Cincinnati Catholic Telegraph-Register editorialized : " Unfortunately , in too many instances the Christmas parties serve only to show that both the boss and his office staff can be somewhat less than human when they let down their hair . Instead of raising office morale , such parties tend to lower office morals . "
