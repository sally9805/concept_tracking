The 1956 Democratic farm program as outlined by Candidate Adlai Stevenson in speeches at Newton , Iowa and Oklahoma City : <P> <P> I want to talk to you about the people who run their own farms , keep store , work for themselves . These people are an issue in this campaign . . . They are in danger of being swallowed up by big corporations in alliance with big government in a world which has become dangerously indifferent to the fate of the little man . This threat of bigness shows itself in many forms . It shows itself in the struggle of the farmer to survive-in the fact that the family farmer in many parts of our country has his back to the wall . . . <P> Men whose life has been lived in a vast corporation do not see a disaster like the drought as a human problem . They see farms and livestock only as statistics . As a result , relief is grudging and reluctant , too much red tape , too little real help-and always too late . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have had particular reason to feel the neglect and the indifference of a big-business administration . For three years the Republican leaders watched farm prices fall with philosophical calm . This is the nice , polite way of saying they did nothing-until election year came around . . . <P> More Than Stopgap . This year we have the best farm plank in our Democratic platform that any party ever had . . . We propose to support basic commodities at 90% of parity . We propose to extend protection to perishables through a combination of direct production payments , marketing agreements and production adjustments . In this connection I would like to try production payments to encourage earlier marketing of hogs in the years when the runs are heavy . This may be a good way to help end the anxiety and the anguish of violent price movement . <P> We will administer vigorously the soil bank , a good Democratic idea . <P> <P> And I would urge consideration of what could be called a " legume bank " to change the emphasis from reducing cash crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> We must go on to assure ample credit at fair rates to the farmer who has to borrow money . We must protect REA co-ops by safeguarding and using the preference clause and by assuring them adequate funds for transmission , generation and distribution . We must conserve the greatest asset we have inherited-the soil . We must strengthen the agricultural conservation program and the Soil Conservation Service , restore the role of leadership to the conservation districts , restore the administration of agricultural programs to farmers , and take emergency measures when needed to prevent another dust bowl .
