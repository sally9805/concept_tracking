The Lions Club of Flagler , Colo. ( pop . 793 ) last week put on the first air show in the town 's history . A thousand farmers , small-town businessmen , their wives and children turned out . It was great weather for flying . <P> Promptly at 2 p.m. , Fred Ruble of Denver began a soaring demonstration in his sail plane and drew gasps of delight and awe . Just after he landed , the crowd heard the snarl of a plane coming in fast and low . It was 1st Lieut . Norman L. Jones of Denver , an experienced Air Force pilot , arriving in a low-wing monoplane . He was late . All pilots had been instructed to report by 2 for final briefing on safety . He zoomed the plane over the field at a 45 angle , just 200 feet off the ground , trailing smoke from the skywriting generator . The show 's sponsors frowned . Jones was violating two rules : flying under 500 feet and stunting near the spectators . <P> The plane hurtled above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then with an eerie roar it ripped downward , crushed spectators , smashed six cars , including an ambulance . In an instant , the happy crowd was turned into a panic-stricken , blood-spattered mass of humanity screaming in terror and pain . <P> " God , it was awful , " said Charlie Keller , a Flagler farmer who was standing with his wife , his 14-year-old daughter Zenelda , and six-year-old twins Johnny and Josephine . " I saw this plane coming . I hollered . ' Mama , duck ! ' I dived between two cars . There was an awful roar , and then this loud crash . I got up . looked around . Mama was n't there . I could n't see the children either , A short time before the accident . Mama said to me . ' Somebody could get killed . ' I remember I said , I guess somebody could get killed , Mama . ' " Keller found his wife , Zenelda and Johnny dead . <P> That night Flagler counted the gala day 's toll : 20 dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member killed or hurt . The toll might have been even worse . Just before the crash , a crowd of children ran from the fatal spot to get a better look at Fred Ruble 's sail plane . <P> Among the dead was the only one who might have explained why it happened : Pilot Jones .
