txt The Maine Central Railroad sent a revised exchange offer to holders of preferred stock who are being asked to accept debentures and cash for the preferred stock and arrears due on it . The Securities and Exchange Commission , which required the ' company to revise an earlier exchange offer , said it has no objections to the second communication . Philip A. Loomis Jr. , director of the S.E.C. 's division of trading and exchanges had told the railroad management the , first offer tended to be misleading because of omissions . However , in the new communication , the company did not change basic elements of the exchange plan . This is to offer $4,500,000 of 51A% income debentures for preferred shares carrying arrears of $55 each . The exchange basis is $150 of debentures and $5 in cash for each share of $100 par preferred . The company , however , amplified statements in the earlier offer that drew objections from preferred shareholders as well as the S.E.C. It also extended the expiration date of the exchange offer from March 26 to July 81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form which allows preferred shareholders who have already deposited their shires to initiate withdrawal if they desire . Preferred shareholders have called the plan a boon to common stockholders who are blocked from receiving dividends while the arrears on the preferred are outstanding . The company in its first exchange offer said officers and directors were going along with the plan , but did not reveal their holdings . These are shown in the revised offer to be largely in common stock . Seventeen directors own 52,749 shares of common and 220 shares of preferred and ten officers own 289 shares of common and 108 shares of preferred . The company reported that 120,000 common shares and 30,000 preferred shares are outstanding . The company also amplified an earlier statement that debenture holders would receive $8.25 of interest annually " if earned . " S.E.C. sources said there was not sufficient indication that other company obligations , such as earlier bonds and a sinking Rind , have priority over the new debentures . The company also emphasized that dissenting holders of preferred who do not exchange still must be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . Should the exchange offer- be approved by a specified 90% of preferred holders , the dissenting minority would be the only block to making common stock dividend payments . This would appear to increase the changes for payment of the arrears on preferred still held by dissenters . The S.E.C. does not pass on railroad financing proposals unless they are believed in violation of securities laws . The Interstate Commerce Commission has primary jurisdiction over railroad financing and an I.C.C . examiner has heard arguments of the railroad as well as objecting preferred holders . The I.C.C . has received scores of letters from preferred holders arguing both for and against the exchange .
