As he took off from his capital city of Salisbury in his old Royal Rhodesia Air Force Dakota , burly Sir Roy Walensky , 51 , onetime boxing champion and locomotive engineer and now Prime Minister of the Central African Federation , seemed every inch the bwana of good will . He was bound on a 2,500-mile mission to carry the message of federation to the most remote tribes of Northern Rhodesia . <P> For his stop at the jungle village of Mongu , capital of the protectorate of Barotseland , he had loaded his plane with special offerings . In response to an SOS from Barotseland 's 354 whites , he brought along a sack of potatoes and six crates of beer . For the protectorate 's 280,000 blacks , he brought his most friendly manner . But in Barotseland , where 900 people were arrested for witchcraft last year and a cow can fetch 12 while a bride brings only 5 , the natives have some stubborn ideas . " They have a habit , " a local British official had warned , " of continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without their Paramount Chief 's being consulted . " <P> " Tell Sir Roy . . . " On hand to meet Sir Roy were the members of the Saasikalo Kuta ( hereditary Barotse national council ) and Paramount Chief Mwanawina III , wearing instead of his usual ceremonial admiral 's uniform a natty business suit . " Tell Sir Roy , " prompted the British resident commissioner , " what is in your hearts . " The protectorate 's Ngambela ( Prime Minister ) dropped to his knees , and clapping his hands softly , shuffled over to the Paramount Chief to ask permission to speak . " Amazing , " murmured Sir Roy . " Pity I ca n't introduce something like that in the federal house . " <P> The Barotse leaders , it seemed , disliked federation , not because it brought too little freedom to their people , but because it might bring too much . The Ngambela objected especially to Sir Roy 's new franchise act , which , by slowly spreading the vote among Africans , threatened to undermine the hereditary powers of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Barotse , " because it did not come to us through our Paramount Chief , or even through the resident commissioner . It blew into the territory like a piece of waste paper . " <P> Up in Flames . Next day at Lusaka , Sir Roy faced a more familiar sort of opposition . Outside the hotel where he was attending a tea party , six members of the black-supremacist African National Congress paraded up and down with signs reading , WE DEMAND ONE MAN , ONE VOTE , and REMOVE THE COLOR BAR ON RAILWAYS . Urban Negro politicians believe that Sir Roy 's go-slow policy on racial equality is his way of forever postponing the promised racial partnership . As Sir Roy flew home , Northern Rhodesian Negroes were astir over the latest plan to increase African representation in the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council , while keeping it safely dominated by Europeans . As mobs cheered and sang God Bless Africa , copies of the plan were heaped upon funeral pyres in village after village , and went up in flames .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
