NEW DIRECTIONS XI . ( 512 pp. ) - Edited by James Laughlin-New Directions ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> Until he was 16 , James Laughlin , heir to a slice of one of Pittsburgh 's biggest steel fortunes , * hardly knew the difference between the avant-garde and the guard at a foundry gate . English Teacher Dudley Fitts soon changed all that . At Choate , in 1931 , Teacher Fitts took spindling , six-foot Student Laughlin in hand , introduced him to the work of such dedicated modern versifiers as T. S. Eliot , Ezra Pound and E. E. Cummings . Laughlin , who until then had hardly cracked a book on his own account , burst forthwith into creative bloom , decided to bypass the steel business and devote his life to writing . <P> Restless young " J. " Laughlin left Harvard after his freshman year , took off for a Wanderjahr in Europe . There U.S. expatriate writers filled his ears with a doleful cry : Why was there no publisher in America willing to take a chance on avant-garde writing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a publisher . He collected a big eclectic bundle of literary odds &; ends ( by such writers as Gertrude Stein , Kay Boyle , Jean Cocteau , Marianne Moore , Wallace Stevens ) and in 1936 , while still in college , published them in one volume as the first New Directions annual . New Directions books and pamphlets quickly followed . <P> Fourteen years and ten annuals later , moose-tall ( 6 ft. 5 in . ) Publisher Laughlin now runs his mushrooming but so far non-profit-making firm from a bright , sparsely staffed office high above Manhattan 's Greenwich Village . He has gained a towering reputation as an incorruptible " esthetic " publisher , while steadfastly maintaining his literary perceptions at the hit-or-miss level of his Harvard days . <P> Like its hefty predecessors , jumbo-size New Directions XI is a literary junk shop where table after table full of crusty , dusty , doggedly experimental writing will discourage all but the hardiest . But those who do not mind shopping hard for their literary fare will stumble on a few things worth the eyestrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with homosexual themes ( The Fall of Valor , Other Voices , Other Rooms , The City and the Pillar ) , most U.S. readers will hardly need New Directions ' radar to detect the trend ; but with sophomoric emphasis N.D. XI detects it anyhow in half a dozen inverted short stories and prose fragments . The queen of the queerer pieces is a collection of excerpts from Parisian Jean Genet 's lushly symbolic novel , Our Lady of Flowers ( explains Editor Laughlin in an introductory note : " Genet uses the pronouns more or less interchangeably " ) . <P> Prognosticators searching among the unknown contributors for tomorrow 's literary white-haired boy will find New Directions ' radar scope pretty murky . Most of the brand-new writers in N.D. XI stick to well-worn avant-garde trails , either rediscover a flabby surrealism ( " The rabbits jumped on the bed and sat in a furry row , staring " ) or , like Harvard Student John Hawkes , lose their story in a messy Joycean montage of elliptical dialogue and overfertilized imagery . A deadening number of these interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been published .
