A Story by Shirley Jackson D IMING the greater part of my married life my Great-Aunt Gertrude was in the hospital ; my oldest child was only a baby when I heard from my mother that Aunt Gertrude had been found by a neighbor lying at the foot of her back steps with a broken hip , and my mother added in a postscript that when the old lady woke up in the hospital and found out where she was , and why , the only thing that worried her was what would become of her cats . Finally , the cats got fed and cared for by neighbors , and they bred among themselves as they always had , pure white , and the old ones , unlike Aunt . Gertrude , died off , and the new ones grew up , and although the neighbors fed them and tried to take diem in , they lived , the young ones as well as the old , around Aunt Gertrude 's back door , sheltering under the steps . The neighbors wrote us that it was amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door which they had never seen opened . Aunt Gertrude stayed in the hospital for so many years that the original cats , and the generation following , had all died off or wandered away , but there was a splendid crop of pure white kittens at the hack door when the doctors - finally decided that Aunt Gertrude , so old and so lonely for her cats and her and the low echoing ceilings of her house , ought to be brought home for the family gracefully called " the little left to her . " The family brought forward an unmarried cousin to feed the cats and tend the roses and wheel Aunt Gertrude out into the sunlight every morning , and it was generally conceded among the nieces and nephews that all the available family ought to make a point of calling upon Aunt . Gertrude at least once before  --  we remarked to one another , nodding gravely  --  Aunt Gertrude " left her cottage for good . " There was , moreover , a pressing , but civilly silent , competition among several of the nieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our common -great-greatgrandmother , and which Aunt Gertrude used to keep fancy sewing and cat food in . My older son , Laurie , was eleven years old , and my daughters Jannie and Sally eight and five , when at last I took them to meet their Great-Great-Aunt Gertrude . They ought to see her once , " I told my husband , with a kind of wistful smile , " before Aunt Gertrude Leaves the Family for Ever . " My husband gave me a long thoughtful look . " You know perfectly well your cousin Barbara is going to get that breakfront , " he said . " In that little apartment of hers ? " I laughed bitterly . " I would n't put it past her , of course , but ? " " Give Aunt Gertrude my love , " my husband said , putting his paper up before his face . " it 's so many years since I saw her last . " I went on , with a pang of real terror . " She used to scare me so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzanne Suba the thousands of roses , the homemade fruit cake . . . I shivered . " Petit point , " I said inadequately . " Preserved figs . " HEN , at last , with the children mumbling uneasily in the back of the car , I came over the long road which brought me into the pleasant valley where Aunt Gertrude lived in her small house with her cats and her . roses , I found that a dozen unexpected memories came back at me : the dust , and the woods coming down to the back of Aunt Gertrude 's cottage , and the way the cottage itself always seemed so tall until you came right onto it , because of the high stone steps which led up from the road . " Children , " I said , when we came in sight of the woods , and the roses , and the steps , " children , Aunt Gertrude is very old , you know . " " Is she a witch ? " Sally asked , peering through the car window , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ? " " I want you to behave quietly , " I said , deciding upon a tactful by-pass to Sally 's question , " and there is to be no giggling , and no arguing , and no shoving . " " Do I have to kiss her ? " Laurie asked . " I rather think not , " I said , remembering suddenly and vividly the soft and wrinkled old cheek which Aunt Gertrude had , so long ago , presented to me. " just remember that Aunt Gertrude is very old . " " Is she a hundred ? " Sally asked . " I would n't he surprised , " I said . " Is she a thousand ? " " Well . . . " I said . " A 7,1 illion ? " Laurie wriggled miserably . " I do n't want to go , " he said . I stopped the car in front of the high stone steps and turned to look at Laurie . ' " Look , " I said reasonably , " it 's only this once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Laurie said . ' In that little house , I 'll sit on the wrong thing or I 'll step on something or I 'll fall over or something . " I laughed and told him , " I stepped on a cat once . Aunt Gertrude laughed , but my mother was embarrassed . " " Did you get spanked ? " Sally asked with interest , " is she going to say abracadabra , Aunt Gertrude ? Witches always say abracadabra , " she told Jannie . We got out of the car , moving slowly , and stood below in the road , looking up the steep steps and the pink roses above . " I 'm scared , " ' Fannie said ; she came over and slipped her hand into mine . " Is Aunt Gertrude big ? " " No , " I said . " Very small . " " I 'm scared , " Jannie said simply . I. took a deep breath . " Come along , dears , " I said , and we went up the steps , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and feet . I found , with a kind of bewilderment , that I had to bend my head to come onto the porch , although Laurie and Jannie and Sally passed easily under the low doorway framed in roses , and I knocked on the door with the conviction that it had been only a day or so since I last saw its glass panel , engraved with a floral design , and chipped in the lower right-hand corner . " Ooh , " said Jannie softly as the door opened , and I remembered the rich smells of fruit cake and marmalade and pressed rose petals and cinnamon . C OUS1N Maude opened the door , and 1 stood for a minute , the children pressed nervously close to me , and Cousin Maude told me that Aunt Gertrude was as well as might be expected , arid , sighing , that Aunt Gertrude seemed as spry as ever , and I reported to Aunt Maude upon the health and prosperity of all the cousins she had n't seen recently , and she told me about Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' from my mother , expurgated . " I brought the children to say hello to Aunt Gertrude , " I explained at last , trying unsuccessfully to step aside from the clinging creatures at my skirts . " They wanted to meet her . " This was a statement so patently false that even Cousin Maude forbore to comment . " Hello , darlings , " she said perfunctorily " I 'll see if the old bird 's awake , " she said to me . " I want to go home , " Jannie said very audibly . " Me , too , " Laurie said . Cousin Maude went to the door of the bedroom and listened ; the cottage had only two rooms , and I remembered clearly that sounds from one room were heard distinctly in the other : when Jannie began again , " I want to ? " I took her hand tight and shook my head violently , and she was unwillingly quiet . Cousin Maude nodded and beckoned us to the bedroom doorway , and , dragging Jannie and followed without enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aunt Gertrude , " said Cousin Maude in a loud and vivacious voice , " here are some visitors for you , and is n't that lovely ? " " Oh , go away , " said a voice from within , and I suddenly remembered Aunt Gertrude so vividly that it seemed like my mother pulling me instead of me pulling Jannie . " Hello , Aunt Gertrude , " I said weakly . She was lying in bed , with pillows propping her up , and she was wearing a pink satin bed-jacket trimmed with lace , and after one look at her I recognized clearly that Aunt Gertrude was very likely still the wickedest and liveliest old lady in the world . " How do you feel , Aunt Gertrude ? " I asked from the doorway . " Another one ? " she said , and chuckled . " Come in , dear , " she said . " What 's that you 've got with you ? Children ? " " This , " I said , pulling , " is my son Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H'lo , " said Sally , who seemed to he the only one of my children still able to articulate . Aunt Gertrude waved largely at a long sofa upholstered in apricot satin which stood parallel to her bed . " Sit down , " she said , and , wordlessly , my children obeyed . I stood behind them protectively . Beyond us , the roses MAGAZINE touched the windowpane and the sky was blue ; inside , Aunt Gertrude leaned forward and regarded us with her old eyes open wide . " Now , " she said . " Tell me what you learned in school today , my dears . " She pointed at Laurie . " You , boy , " she said . " What 's your name ? " " Laurence , " said Laurie in a whisper . " Named after your Uncle Clifford ? Indeed . Good girl , " and she nodded approvingly at me . " And what did you learn in school ? " she asked again . " Fractions , " said Laurie , paralyzed . " So did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Loved every minute of it , I did . Never got the footwork straight , " she said in an aside to me , " but no point letting on . Now , you , what 's your name ? " ? " Joanne . " " Pretty girl , " said Aunt Gertrude . " Your mother ever tell you about the time I danced with the Prince of Wales ? " She laughed hugely . " Mercy ! " she said . " Did you ? " Jannie asked , " did you honest , with a prince ? " Aunt Gertrude laughed again . " Let 's see your hair , child , " she said . Jannie came , glancing at me , up to the bed , and Aunt Gertrude touched her hair lingeringly . " Can you sit on it ? " she demanded . j ANNIE giggled. , suddenly . " I never tried , " she said . She looked over her shoulder and backed up to the sofa and tried to sit down on her hair , and Aunt Gertrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor , he did . Was n't true , you know , " she said , shaking an admonishing finger at Jannie , " at least three prettier than I was . Never get thinking you 're prettier than you are , child . " " Did he wear a sword , " Laurie asked , fascinated , " Aunt Gertrude ? " " Sort of thing one had to say , " Aunt Gertrude went on , nodding . " I had the prettiest hair , though . I , " she said sternly to Jannie , " could sit on my hair , do n't forget ihal . " ? " I 'll try , " said Jannie obscurely . " And you , " Aunt Gertrude said , turning to Sally , " what have you to say for yourself , girl ? " Sally thought . " What do you use for teeth ? " she asked . " Sally ! " I said . 53 " Good question . " Aunt Gertrude leaned back , thinking . " Play much baseball ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faltered and said , " I guess so . " " If we had one good pitcher , " said Aunt Gertrude , and shook her head sadly . " That was before I met Mr. Corcoran , of course , " she told me . " My late dear husband . " " Naturally , " I said . " Mr. Corcoran , " she told Laurie , " was not an athletic type of man like yourself . Most refined , of course , but not altogether athletic . A little chess now and then , occasionally a game of bowls , or , on warm evenings , croquet . Sad for one as enthusiastic as I. " " Did he have a sword ? " asked Laurie tenaciously. 44 , " SAID Aunt Gertrude , " but he had good sound investments . There was a dance for you , ' ' she went on dreamily , " and I was in yellow , most daring then , of course , taffeta . Alencon lace . And very daring , " she added archly to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a trip in those clays , my clears . I remember we once had a rabbit in the carriage , but of course my mother spoke to the man at once . We thought she was going to faint . " " ? a sword ? " " It 's all very long ago , " Aunt Gertrude said . She looked at the children . " You would n't remember , of course , " she said . " Where is that rabbit now ? " Sally asked . " Fine children , " said Aunt Gertrude , nodding sleepily . " Fine children . Married that young man , did you ? " " Nearly fourteen years ago , " I said . Aunt Gertrude nodded again . " Always liked him , " she said . " Nice young fellow . Red and white tie . " " Not that one , " I said , horrified . " No , no , Aunt Gertrude , not that . one . I ? " " Strong resemblance , " Aunt Gertrude said , nodding at Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a radio announcer somewhere in Ohio now , " I said . " I married ? " " Reminded me of your Uncle Clifford , " Aunt Gertrude said . She brought her head up suddenly . " When 's that fool girl going to put me to sleep ? " she demanded . We tiptoed out , the children and I , and Aunt Gertrude stirred , and smiled , and spoke softly to herself . I told Cousin Maude that Aunt Gertrude was asleep , and the children and I went precariously down the steep-stone steps . Halfway clown I stopped and said , " We ought to take a rose each ; Aunt Gertrude always used to tell me. " s OLEIVINLY , avoiding thorns , I picked a for myself , and we got back into the car . huge pink rose for each child , and one I started the car , looking up at Aunt Gertrude 's house and wondering if I would ever come here again ; in the mirror I could see the three children sitting quietly on the back seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley , and up the long green hill , and could sec far behind only the great heap of roses that was Aunt Gertrude 's cottage , before " Someday , Jannie moved slightly , and spoke . is coming I think , " she said , " that prince back . " . " With his sword , " said Laurie . There was another long silence , and then Sally said , " She was n't a witch at all , I do n't know why Mommy said she was , Aunt Gertrude . I even lilted her . " " I 'm going to keep my rose forever , " Jannie said , and Sally said , " I 'm going to keep mine , too . " " She 's sure pretty lucky , " Laurie said . " Golly , " Jannie said , " and the prince coming back , and all . "
