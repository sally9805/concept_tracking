Bob Taft confidently predicted last winter that he would win 19 or 20 of the state of Washington 's 24 delegates . Then the Eisenhower forces went to work . They turned up last week in Spokane with a solid majority of the state convention delegates . The Taft minority threatened to walk out and hold a rump convention of their own . After ten hours of the stormiest politicking the state could remember , the issue was settled by the Ike majority electing 20 delegates , granting 4 to Taft . <P> Other convention results last week : <P> At the Maryland convention , the 24 delegates elected were instructed to vote on the first ballot at Chicago for Governor Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin , who is said to be seeking the nomination for Vice President . McKeldin is expected to throw about 18 of them to Eisenhower , while 6 go to Taft . <P> In Montana , Taft 's lines held firm . Eisenhower won just one of the state 's 8 delegates . <P> At Democratic conventions last week in North Carolina , Delaware and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines were generally in comfortable control . Estes Kefauver , the front runner by far in the primary votes to date , managed to pick up only 2 Chicago votes from the no delegates chosen ( with 84 votes ) . Senator Russell got 19 votes ( all in North Carolina ) , Stevenson 7 , Kerr 1 , Barkley 2 , Harriman 2 . The remaining 492 votes were uncommitted.
