Andrei Vishinsky is a gifted ham actor . <P> The white-maned old faker , now head of the Soviet delegation to the U.N. , commands a dozen voices , from the sly wheedle to the choleric roar , a dozen expressions , from the impish grin to the basilisk glare . For all his arrogance , he is a much more entertaining performer than Russia 's wooden men-Molotov , Malik , Gromyko . He is also a remarkable survivor of 37 years of power struggle in the Kremlin . A onetime Menshevik , he came through unscathed when the Bolsheviks put the Mensheviks out of business in 1921 . He not only rode out the great purges of the ' 30s but was the flamboyant and savage state prosecutor of their victims . He became a diplomat in 1940 . Stalin 's death brought him a reduction in rank ( from Foreign Minister to his present post ) but never stirred a hair of his snowy head . <P> Last week the Russian delegation disclosed that Vishinsky was sailing for home May 5 on the Queen Elizabeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times frontpaged a report that he was ill , weary , tired of the U.S. and eager to retire . He is nearing 71 . Vishinsky himself would not comment ( except to squawk that the Times , which said he was 71 , never got the facts right ) , but he is reportedly resentful that he was not invited to Geneva , which , more than the Berlin Conference , concerns subjects supposedly his specialty , such as Korea .
