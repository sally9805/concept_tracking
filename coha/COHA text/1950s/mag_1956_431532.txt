 | Write me a Poem , Baby A friend of mine recently told me that his two daughters , ages nine and eleven , were hard at work writing a play . They had n't got very far with it as yet , but their father suggested that I might like to have a look at their work in progress . I agreed , and he produced the following script : ACT 1 HELENA , coming on the stage in the middle . HELENA : I wonder what is keeping Charles Arnold the Tv repair man . There is a knock . HELENA : Come in . Charles Arnold conies in . CHARLES : Where is the Tv set . HELENA : ( to Herself ) My he is very handsome considering he is only a Tv repair man . CHARLES : I am here to repair the Tv set . HELENA : It is badly broke and will he hard work so would you like to have a hi-ball . CHARLES : No but I will take a cup of tea . HELENA : Hunif . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was enough to warrant certain critical observations . I said that I thought it was a splendid beginning , that among other attributes it had almost unbearable suspense . I gave it as my opinion that if the girls could maintain the pace they 'd probably have a hit show on their hands . If I seem to have been too enthusiastic , I 'd better explain that I have long been a pushover for the literary work of small children . They are , as a general rule , much better writers than their elders . They bring a freshness and verve to their work that is often lacking in adult writers . And their integrity is absolute . It happens that I have preserved a few examples of inspired writing by young children , and now that I 've dug them out of my files and studied them anew I 'm more impressed than ever with the beauty and the wisdom reflected in them . Let us take the case of Susie Clemens . She was thirteen at the time her father was writing The Adventures of Huckleberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged on a secret literary project ? her own biography of Mark Twain . Susie was convinced that other people ( meaning adults ) who had written about her father had failed to get his essential qualities on paper , and it was her aim to rectify , the situation . The flavor of her own delightful study is reflected in a single sentence , which I quote : " He has the mind of an author exactly , some of the simplest things he ca n't understand . " Susie 's punctuation may be slightly askew , but no sensible person would object to that . Among all the telling sentences that came from the pen of her illustrious father , none excels Susie 's for sheer perceptivity and depth . Children have proved their virtuosity in every branch of the writing trade . Their genius shows itself most frequently , of course , in their correspondence . A good fat book could be compiled of examples that might well rank as minor classics . A little boy from New York City , visiting on an upstate farm , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pigs . They saw a great big pig and they chased him all around the pen and caught him and then threw him down on the ground and started chewing the buttons off his vest . " And here , a little girl 's note to her grandmother : " Thank you for your nice present , I always wanted a pin cushion , although not very much . " One of the principal reasons children are such excellent writers is the fact that , they are not hamstrung by tradition . The wisdom of the ages impresses them not at all . They strike out boldly for themselves , usually with a fine naturalistic instinct , such as that displayed by a little girl who spent many weeks crossstitching a sampler for her favorite aunt , a maiden lady . When the sampler was @#  | finally completed , it bore this motto " Let me live in a house By the side of the road And be friendly with men . " One of the most widely quoted of juvenile writing is a letter from ten-year-old girl to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a volume about penguins , enclosing a card urging her to express her opinion of it . She wrote : " This book gives me more information about penguins than I care have . " The late Hugh Gibson , who turned from diplomacy to literature , described that letter as the finest piece of literary criticism he had ever read . In the field of fiction , children are often simply superb . Walter Davenport tells of a short story produced by a nine-year-old lass of his acquaintance . Here it is : " Once upon a time there was a lit:1n girl named Clarise Nancy Imogcne LaRose . She had no hair and rat : - : - large feet . But she was extremely r : and the rest was easy . " When it comes to murder stories  - -  . r children have always shown rare tale-. : I once found , in a British book , a firs : - rate example written by a small be . " Chapter I There was once a merderer . : yellow eyes and his wife said to h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was hung on Tuesday next . Finis " There it is , cutting straight to -. heheart of the matter . No fooling around with an involved ending . Hit the reader squarely between the eyes ! That 's  - -  - . r system ? and we see it again in -. -. t work of another boy who set down following story in Sunday school : " Once there was a man named Elisha . He owned three bears and lived in a dark cave . One day some little boys threw stones at Elisha and Elisha said , if you throw stones at me I 'll tell my bears and they 'll eat you up . And they did and he did and the bears did . " I 've checked this version with the original in the Second Book of Kings . The facts have been altered somewhat but the little boy 's story reads easier and has more drama and more flair to it . The art of poetry has always bees considered the most difficult of writing forms , but not to children . Where as adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a single sonnet a child sits down and knocks off a poem with all the facility he might employ in eating a banana . Jean Stafford , whose present-day fiction is loaded with hid meanings , produced a poem at the of six . It read : " Gravel , gravel on the ground , Lying there so safe and sound . Why is it you look so dead ? Is it because you have no head " - I am not very good at hidden meanings , and I do n't know what hidden mean : -. ea @# @#  | are in that poem , but I suspect they are there . After giving considerable thought to it , I find that it says something to me . It tells me that I am extremely fortunate that gravel has no head . ( Jean Stafford , by the way , says that when she was a little girl she read the newspapers quite a bit , and for a long while she thought that one of the crimes for which people were arrested was man 's laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room in Paris , wrote a poem and had it published at the age of three . Actually she did n't write it , because she could n't write , but dictated it to her mother . It was published in FPA 's column , The Conning Tower . It follows : " When we dance round the Christmas tree , We are full of good glee . But those who have no Christmas tree , Have n't any good glee . " Another child poet to consider is Mary Small . Years ago when I was a newspaper interviewer , I had a long talk with Miss Small , then a prominent juvenile singing star . At the time of the interview she was sixteen , and she said she could remember writing a poem when she was eight , a poem called " My Dad . " I asked her if she could recite it , and she could and she did and the bears did . I copied it down as follows : " My Dad " He 's the best in the world And will always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . He works and toils And never complains , But secretly inside Endures his pains . We greet him with joy When he comes home at night , From his labors to home Is a wonderful sight . When he plays with us We have such fun For he loves his two daughters And his dear little son . We 'll worship him Through sorrow and tears , And I 'll work for him For the rest of my years . " I was much younger then than I am now , and more romantic in my outlook , and I must confess that I was stirred by Miss Small 's poem . I told her it sounded beautiful , but that there was one part that did n't quite mesh ? the part where the poem says , " From his labors to home Is a wonderful sight . " " Just what is a wonderful sight , Mary ? " I asked her . " From his labors to home Is a wonderful sight , ' " she said , her blue eyes getting very wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it says in the poem , but it does n't sound right . " " I know it does n't , " she agreed , " but that 's the way I wrote it . I was very corny in those days . " I think you 'll search a long time before you find a grown-up poet who will confess to being confused by his own stuff . I do n't think T. S. Eliot would ever unbend and make such an admission as Miss Small made . And I doubt that T. S. Eliot talks much about his first venture into writing . When he was seven years old he  | wrote a two-page biography of George Washington . The last line of it was : " And then he died , of corse . " There are some among us who believe that Mr. Eliot , in all his later strivings , has never quite equaled that single line for clarity and dramatic impact . When the late Alexander Woollcott was ten , he went to a children 's party in suburban Philadelphia . At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Alec was almost prophetical in his succinct reply . " I would rather be a Fabbulous Monster . " We come now to the field of historical romance . To my own mind the most noteworthy performance in this area was that of Peter Matson . Back in 1943 , when he was ten , Peter turned out a swashbuckling saga of " the olden time " and titled it The Box That Would n't Open . His father , Norman Matson , a writer of fiction , thought that Peter 's work had merit , and he showed it around . A national magazine bought and published it . A dozen years have passed since Peter wrote his story . It is no longer remembered as a story , but a tiny part of it has achieved a sort of immortality . Somewhere in the tale was the line : " Useless to talk , said the French spy . " That line became common currency in the Norman Matson household , and it still is . Whenever any troublesome situation arises and ca n't be resolved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug and say , " Useless to talk , said the French spy . " The very speaking of the line usually restores good humor and clears the atmosphere , and the problem at hand is quickly solved . Through the years the practice of quoting the line has spread to the families of relatives and friends , until nowadays it is heard frequently in various parts of our country and in foreign lands . It has brought a happy conclusion to many a quarrelsome interlude , and for that reason I think it 's an important contribution to literature . Let us conclude with an item a composition describing an automobile trip she took with her family to Niagara Falls . The concluding sentence read : " On the way home we past through many lovely fallen rock zones . " It took a child to recognize a fact that was never apparent to me : If you can keep your mind off getting hit by a boulder , a fallen-rock zone is almost always lovely .
