MORRIS Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , Dec. 2 ? The crisis in Korea gave impetus today to Congressional drives for additional billions in appropriations and taxes to build up the country 's military strength and to help finance the program . In view of President Truman 's request of . yesterday for $17,85 ' 0 , - 000,000 more in defense funds , however , prospects of putting rearmament on a " pay-as-you-go " basis became exceedingly remote . There appeared to be no question that Congress would promptly provide the requested money , which would raise military and atomicenergy appropriations in the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account arms aid to Western Europe . Likewise , enactment this year of an excessprofits tax bill to produce at least $3,000,000,000 annually in new revenue was now regarded as practically a " sure thing " in some responsible Congressional quarters . Longer Session Considered Senate fiscal leaders were prepared to recommend that Congress remain in session throughout the , month if necessary , with a brief recess for Christmas , to complete action on the current appropriations and tax programs . In this connection , emphasis was laid on , the desirability of clearing the legislative decks for even more appropriations and taxes next year . The possibility of continuing the present session until a few days , before the new Congress convenes , Jan. 3 was raised by Senator Walter F. George , Democrat of Georgia , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee . The military situation , coupled with the President 's new request for defense appropriations , " makes it possible " as well as " of paramount importance " for Congress to complete action this year on the tax bill , he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure had been eliminated by the rereverses in Korea and " the debacle we face . " Senate to Start Hearings The measure is slated for almost certain House passage next Tuesday , and the Senate Finance Committee will start hearings on it in the meantime with JOhn W. Snyder , Secretary of the Treasury , as the first witness on Monday . Senator George 's timetable calls for completion of the hearings by the end of the week , after which the committee would go behind closed doors and " work day and night " on the bill to get it to the Senate in time for passage before a Christmas recess . The measure would then go to a Senate-House conference committee for agreement on the final draft . The conferees could work during the holidays and submit the completed bill to Congress on Dec. 29 or 30 , Mr. George suggested . Since further tax increases " un // doubtedly " would be requested next year , " to provide possibly $6,000 , - 000,000 or $7,000,000,000 more revenue , Mr. George said it was " very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He observed that to produce that much revenue it would be necessary to raise taxes " all along the line . " Disposing of the excess profits issue beforehand would enable Congress to give its attention at once to the " whole field " of taxation , he said . As for the possibility of increasing taxes sufficiently to attain President Truman 's original goal of financing the defense program on a current basis , Mr. George said this would be impossible if expenditures continued at the rate indicated at present . Notes Situation May Change " We might have done it if the Korean situation had resolved itself as it seemed to be doing a few weeks ago , " he added . " Still , the situation may change before we are called on to raise additional revenue . " Senator George noted that more than $70,000,000,000 of appropriations were already in prospect for the present fiscal year , which ends June 30 . Although only a part of them will actually be spent before the next fiscal year , the figure provides a rough indication of the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He noted that existing tax laws , together with a $3,000,000,000 excess profits levy , would produce only about $43,000,000,000 annually . The gap may well be so large that it could not be closed without ruining the economy , he indicated . Representative Robert L. Doughton , Democrat of North Carolina , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , agreed that it would be " pretty difficult " if not impossible to finance the denim program on a current basis . " The economic condition of the country must be kept in mind , " he said . Moreover , he remarked , it would take " a lot of raking and scraping " to raise any substantial amount in additional taxes . The excess-profits tax bill goes before the House Monday for two days of debate . It calls for a 75 per cent levy on earnings in excess of 85 per cent of a corporation 's average annual earnings during its most profitable three years in the four-year period 1946-49 . An optional formula is keyed to return on invested capital . The measure sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum to be paid over all in regular and excess profits taxes . Conecrns with earnings of less than $25,000 would be exempt from excess profits taxes . This would be done through a $25,000 minimum credit against excess profits . President , Truman 's appropriations request was taken up by a House Appropriations subcommittee shortly after it reached Congress yesterday , and intensive closed hearings are scheduled for next week . The aim is to report a bill in time for House consideration week after next .
