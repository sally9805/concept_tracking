txt The profound dilemma in which the United States finds itself in the Middle East is illustrated by the Baghdad Pact meetings about to open in Turkey . On the one hand the eastern members of the pact ? Turkey , Iran , Iraq , and Pakistan ? urgently want the United States to become a full member of the alliance , or at least to back them up much more substantially , both economically and militarily . This sense of urgency is particularly evident in Iran and Iraq  --  the former because of direct Soviet pressure from the north , and the latter because of general Arab hostility toward Iraq 's membership in the Baghdad Pact . These two nations feel that , lacking the firmest kind of support from the United States , they are left vulnerable to the swirling currents of change now abroad in the Middle East . Soviet ' Bogy ' ? On the other hand , other Arab countries ? notably Egypt and Syria ? are bitterly opposed to the Baghdad Pact as a supposed Western device to distract Arab attention ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogy . " In this view Cairo and Damascus appear to be supported ? certainly by the peoples , and to some extent by the governments ? of Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and Lebanon . These contending pressures  --  from the pact members and from the pact 's opponents ? now have reached a critical point , causing intense concentration upon the visit of Secretary of Stare John Foster Dulles to " observe " the Ankara meetings . Officials of the pact nations believe Mr. Dulles scarcely would have come all the way to Ankara unless he were bearing glad tidings ? either of proposed American membership in the alliance , or of a massive program of aid to member states . American officials in the Midli East , aware of the delicacy of the problem , have discounted any new move by Washington at this time . Neutral Slide Hinted tralism " practiced by Egypt and Syria .

This attitude of Iraq became of fresh concern Jan. 24 when Turkish Premier Adnan Menderes made a sudden flying trip to Baghdad , at the invitation of the Iraq Government . Allied diplomats gathering in Ankara speculated that Iraq might be preparing to pull out of the Baghdad Pact ? unless the United States became a full member next week . In addition to talking with Iraqi officials , Mr. Menderes reportedly would talk with Mr. Dulles " somewhere between Baghdad and Teheran . " The American Secretary of State was in Teheran , capital of Iran , for talks with Iranian officials . prior to the pact meetings in Ankara . Despite this new fluidity in the situation , the Baghdad alliance  --  embracing Britain , Turkey , Iraq , Iran , and Pakistan ? remains the keystone of American defense policy in the Middle East . Conceived originally by Mr. Dulles himself , the pact was designed as a link between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the West and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
