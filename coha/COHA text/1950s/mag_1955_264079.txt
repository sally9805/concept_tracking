After 24 hours of continuous negotiations , a rumpled three-man Government board last week announced tentative settlement of the 57-day strike called by nonoperating workers against the Louisville &; Nashville Railroad and its subsidiaries . The walkout had affected 29,000 workers and curtailed traffic in 14 states . <P> The agreement provided for the issues-mostly on health and welfare plans-to be submitted to arbitration . <P> <P> In the past , railroad strikes have often brought White House intervention . Examples : in 1943 President Roosevelt personally worked out an agreement giving railroad workers an extra 5 an hour ; in 1946 President Truman coerced a settlement by threatening , in a nationwide broadcast , to order the Army to break a railroad strike ( he also proposed to Congress that strikers be drafted into the Army ) . One result of such presidential action was to make the National Mediation Board , set up under the Railway Labor Act , little more than a front organization , with both rail labor and management looking hungrily toward the White House as the place to win concessions . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the L. &; N management and the governors of Kentucky , Tennessee and Illinois . Some observers were sharply critical , pointing out that the walkout was the longest major rail strike since 1922 and was marked with violence . Snapped the New Dealing Louisville Courier-Journal : " Strikes which lose millions of dollars for all concerned , which erupt into violence and bloodshed . . . can not be left to the mercies of ' voluntarism . ' " <P> Against such short-range points was a long-range principle . What the hands-off policy does do is place the negotiating emphasis where it belongs : at the collective-bargaining table . It removes the incentive for either labor or management to delay settlement in hope of winning points through the White House . Members of the National Mediation Board were delighted . Said one : " We are all convinced that the Railway Labor Act will function if it is left alone . The L. &; N. strike proves that . "                    @
