At the heart of Europe 's sickness last week , underlying its dollar deficiencies , its currency distempers , its lack of pep and its chronic sweat and tears , was a shortage of one grubby product-coal . <P> Old King Coal is the economic tyrant of Europe . On both sides of the Iron Curtain , he chills the poor , rocks governments , distorts economies and hampers rearmament . In the West he threatens to undo much of the good done by the Marshall Plan ; in the East he blocks Communist Five-Year plans . <P> In Paris last week , Premier Ren Pleven gave French deputies a lesson in elementary economics . " I am amazed , " he said , " that no one has pointed out the real reason why prices have risen more sharply in France than elsewhere in Europe . The coal price influences the cost of almost everything else . " <P> Some of the symptoms of the disease : <P> Of every dollar France gets in U.S. aid , she now spends 75 to import coal from the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton in Pennsylvania sells for $22 a ton in Europe , after shipping costs are added . <P> Europe 's industrial output has increased 40% over prewar , but coal-which industry depends on-is down 7% . <P> Britain , short of 1,500,000 tons of steel for its armament program , last week imposed a strict steel-rationing program . First priority among steel uses went to coal ; defense and export production must take second place . <P> Britain , which used to ship abroad 44 million tons a year , no longer produces enough coal to stoke its own fires and furnaces . The new Tory government had laid down the most stringent household coal rationing in the nation 's history : an average of less than two tons for the entire winter . <P> Empty Bank Vaults . The consequences to Western defense are immense and progressive ; they would be disastrous but for a relatively mild winter . But British families do without meat because there is not enough coal to swap for Argentine beef ; French steel mills stand idle for lack of coal and coke . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government gave its soldiers an eleven-day furlough to save precious coal . Sweden sells its high-grade iron ore to Communist Poland instead of supplying its old customer Britain , because the Poles can trade coal in exchange , the British can not . The Poles , taking advantage of Sweden 's need , get ballbearings and generators in exchange , to nourish the Red army . <P> West German coal production is increasing by leaps &; bounds ( since 1946 , output has jumped 300% ) . But though the International Ruhr Authority still earmarks 25% of German output for export ( mainly to France ) , French steelmen complain that Ruhr shipments of coke and coal have fallen by 25% since 1949 . And German nationalists are whipping up resentment against compulsory coal exports : they accuse the Allies of sending Ruhr coal abroad , and compelling Germany to import more expensive U.S. coal .
