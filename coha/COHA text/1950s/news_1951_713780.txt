txt Canada Bars a ' Y es ' Role to U. S. ; Pearson Sees Unity Despite Friction Br The Un TORONTO , April ** B. Pearson , Canadian Secretary for External Affairs , said today that " easy and automatic " relations between Canada and the United States were a thing of the past . In a speech apparently aimed at United States consumption , Mr. Pearson said that Canada was not willing to be " merely an echo of somebody else 's voice " and reserved the right to criticize " our great friend , the United States . " Mr. Pearson said that Canada intended to prevent the United Nations from becoming " too much the instrument of any one country ' ? and that it was time for the United States to stop telling Canada " that until we do one-twelfth or one-sixteenth , or some other fraction as much as they are doing , we are defaulting . " He said that there might be " angry waves which may weaken the foundation of our friendship " but that Canada would march forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of objectives which we share . " " Nevertheless , the days of relatively easy and automatic relations with our neighbor are , I think , over , " he added . Mr. Pearson indicated that one of the " angry waves " that could weaken relations between Canada and the United States wis the controversy over General of the Army Douglas 's statement on the war in Korea . Later , in a second speech , Mr. Pearson made an indireetreference to General when he said that . a successful foreign policy must work toward goals accepted by the majority of the people , and it would have a better chance of " reaching these goals if we abandon what has been called ' hoop-la diplomacy ' at Lake Success , at Ottawa , or , I hasten to add , at Tokyo . " He said that the free nations stood in danger of " nothing less // than world war " and that peace could not be won by arms alone . EXCERPT FROM THE TALK Following is an excerpt relating to Canadian-United States relations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Canadian Consulate General : With the United States our relations grow , steadily closer as we recognize that our destinies , economic and political , are inseparable in the Western Hemisphere , and that Canada 's hope for peace depends largely on the acceptance by the United States of responsibility for world leadership and on how that responsibility is discharged . With this closeness of contact and with , I hope , our growing maturity goes a mutual understanding and a fundamental friendliness . This makes it possible for us to talk with a frankness and confidence to the United States , which is not misunderstood there except possibly by a minority who think that we should n't talk at all , or who complain that if we do , our accents are too English . But we need not try to deceive ourselves that these close relations with our great neighbor will always be smooth and easy . There will be difficulties and frictions . These , however , will be easier to settle if the United States realizes that while we are most anxious to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the free world , we sire not willing to be merely an echo of somebody else 's voice . It would be easier also if it were recognized by the United States at this time that we in Canada have had our own experience of tragedy and suffering and loss in war . In our turn , we should be careful not to transfer the sus picions and sensitiveness and hesitations of yesteryear from London to Washington . Noy should we get unduly hot an ' bothered over all the pronouncements of journalists or generals or politicians which we do not like , though there may be , indeed , are some on which we have a right to express our views . Canada Pulling Her Weight More important , we must convince the United States by action rather than merely by word that we are , in fact , pulling our weight in this international team . On their side , they should not attempt to tell us that until we do one-twelfth or one-sixteenth , or some other fraction as much as URGES CLOSER ' TIES Lester B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times they are doing in any particular enterprise , we are defaulting . It would also help if the United States took more notice of what we do do , and , indeed , occasionilly of what we say . It is disconcerting , for instance , that about the only time the American people seem to be aware of our existence , in contrast , say , to the existence of a Latin-American republic , is when we do something that they do not like , or do not do something which they would like . I can explain what I mean by illustration . The United States would certainly have resented it , and rightly so , if we in Canada had called her a reluctant contributor to reconstruction in 1946 because her loan to the United Kingdom was only three timed as large as ours , while her national income was seventeen or eighteen times as large . In our turn , most of us resent being called , by certain people in the United States , a reluctant friend because Canada , a smaller power with special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last thirty , - on the threshold of a great and essential pioneer development , and with half a continent to administer , was not able to match , even proportionately , the steps taken by the United States last June and subsequently , which were required by United Nations decisions about Korea . . The leadership then given by the United States rightly won our admiration , ' and the steps that she has taken to implement them since , deserve our deep gratitude . The rest of the world naturally , . however , took some time to adjust itself to a somewhat unexpected state of affairs . Canada , in my view at least , in not making the adjustment more quickly should surely not be criticized more than , say , Argentina or Egypt , or Sweden . There may be other ripples on the surface ' of our friendship in the days ahead , but we should do everything we can in Canada , and this applies especially to the Government , and in the government particularly to the Department of External Affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation of our friendship . I do not think that this will happen . It will certainly be less likely to happen , however , if we face the problems frankly and openly of our mutual relationship . That relationship , as I see it , means marching with the United States in the pursuit of the objectives which we share . It does not mean being pulled along , or loitering behind . Nevertheless , the days of relatively easy and automatic political relations with our neighbor are , I think , over . They are over because , on our side , we are more important in the continental and international scheme of things , and we loom more largely now as an important element in United States and in free world plans for defense and development . They are over also because the United States is now the dominating world power on the side of freedom . Our preoccupation is no longer whether the United States will discharge her international responsibilities , but how she will do it and how the rest of us will be involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago that Colonel Lindbergh suggested that Canada should be detached from membership'in the British Commonwealth of Nations because that international affiliation of ours might get the United States into trouble by involving the larger half of North America in European wars . That seems a long time ago . There are certain people in Canada ( I am got one of them ) , who think that the shoe , if not already on the other foot , is now being transferred to the other foot .
