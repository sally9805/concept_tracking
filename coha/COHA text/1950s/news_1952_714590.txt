txt Yesterday morning we were admonished that if we came home without a garden seed catalogue , the omission would not contribute to our popularity or the general tranquility about our domicile . So the seed catalogue will be delivered . In a day or two the seeds for the garden will be ordered and shipped to us . The minute they arrive the weather will grow cold . It will rain . Matter of fact . it may snow . But if the . seeds can not be planted , at least the garden can be planned and laid out . This will be done . By the time the seeds can be planted , everybody will have forgotten what the plan was . There will not be sufficient time to draw up a new plan and so the seeds will be planted-promiscuously . When they come up , there may be a late frost and it will then be clear that it would have been better to take the time to draw up a new plan . The seeds will eventually grow . So will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the weeds will be keptdown . But this zeal will lag and one day it will be difficult to find the plants among the weeds . When the need for action in this situation becomes sufficiently impressive , it is almost sure to be one of the hottest days of early summer . All of this we know from experience . In nddition we have some suspicions that if we would merely drive up the road and buy some vegetables from the roadside stand , it would be much cheaper than buying seeds , dusts and sprays . Also there would not be involved the task of shelling peas and beans . Nevertheless there will be a garden and eventually and despite all the adverse forces it will produce something . And we will boast slightly about having our own vegetables and feel somewhat superior to the people who buy their vegetables from stores . On some of these luckless people we might even bestow a mess of sweet corn and thus impress them with our superiority .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
