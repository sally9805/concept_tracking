Looking down from the U.S. Senate gallery , bird watchers often observe that Oregon 's Senator Wayne Morse has a notably ornithic look-a sharp beak , darting , saucerish eyes , a tufted head . Since he became an independent last year , Senator Morse has been the busiest , noisiest jay in the Senate ; he interrupts his chatter only to hop over to the press ticker to see what kind of coverage he 's getting . <P> Last week Morse was at full voice . One day he blocked unanimous consent on an emergency bill making a technical change in the officer strength of the armed services . He did n't understand the bill , he said . After Armed Services Chairman Leverett Saltonstall patiently explained the bill , Morse could see no emergency , thought the change could wait for permanent legislation . Finally , Majority Leader Robert A. Taft rose and rammed the bill through on a voice vote . <P> When the Senate met for the next time two days later , Wayne Morse had his reply ready . Taft made the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy synopsis of the previous day 's proceedings . Morse objected , insisting that the journal be read aloud . Under Senate rules , the rarely made request had to be complied with . For 26 wasted minutes the clerk read while Morse slumped in his specially built chair ( it has an extra-long seat to accommodate the Morse slump ) . Next day , Morse " suggested the absence of a quorum , " forced the Senate to adjourn a few moments after it had convened . The day after , he again forced the useless reading of the journal ( 22 minutes ) . Then he rose and yammered for two hours on what the New York Times politely called " a variety of subjects . " <P> For years , Morse and his fellow liberals have been objecting to the filibuster as a wicked , minority-rule device . Now Morse was using typical filibuster tactics , not against any specific piece of legislation but simply to call attention to Wayne Morse .                 @ @ @ @
