txt The United States today hurled an 8,500-pound Atlas ballistic missile into orbit . The missile , two and a half times as heavy as the payload of the Soviet Union 's Sputnik III , became the fifth artificial satellite this country has put into orbit . Sputnik Hi 's payload weighed 2,919 pounds . However , with its missile , which went into orbit separately at the firing on May 15 , it may have weighed a total of about 8,800 pounds . Today 's firing came as a surprise . Only twenty days ago an Atlas was fired 6,300 miles over the Atlantic range . The space vehicle that is now circling the earth once each 100.8 minutes was fired from a launching pad at Cape Canaveral , Fla. , at 6:02 P. M. It is expected to stay in orbit about twenty days , It is expected to burn up when it plunges back into the atmosphere . President Eisenhower made the initial announcement . He received the news at a diplomatic dinner at the White House shortly after 8 P , M. , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Announcement The President almost immediately announced the launching . " The entire vehicle is in orbit , " he said . " This launching constitutes a distinct step forward in space operations . The success opens new opportunities to the United States and all mankind for activities in outer space . " An hour later , at the Pentagon , officials explained that the Atlas satellite was not part of the International Geophysical Year program . It was a military experiment , they emphasized , although it had major uses in the peaceful explorations of outer space . Rear Admiral John E. Clark , deputy chief of the Pentagon 's space agency , and Robert E. Brady , chief of the Army Signal Corps ' communications branch , outlined the purposes of the launching as follows : 9To carry out a novel experiment in communications . The orbiting missile contains radio receiving and transmitting instruments that it is hoped will successfully relay voice and Morse code messages from one ground radio station to another . ( ITo test the strength of the missile and its parts as part of a stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for intercontinental ballistic missiles . Ordinarily such guidance , provided only in the early stage of flight , is achieved through , ground radio controls . The Atlas satellite became the eighth artificial earth satellite to be placed in orbit since the Soviet Union opened the space age Oct. 4 , 1957 . It will be visible at dusk // across the Southern part of the United States , officials said . Its apogee or highest point was estimated at 625 miles and its perigee or lowest point at 118 miles . Its powered flight time was four and one-half minutes , after which its fuel was burned out but it was speeding toward its orbit tract at 17,000 miles an hour . Pentagon officials said that the missile  --  which carries no separate instrument package but itself acts as container for the thirty-five pounds of instruments  --  has two sets of transmitters . One , it explained , is sending signals on frequencies of 107.970 and 107.940 megacycles . But the frequencies of the second set of signals on a large eightwatt transmitter were not divulged , These frequencies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . For the communications experiment , stations at Los Angeles , Fort Huachuca , Ariz. ; Fort Sam Houston , Tex. , and Fort Stewart , Ga. , are being used . As the Atlas appeared within range of the Pacific station at Los Angeles at 7:35 P. M. messages were sent up to it . There was only four minutes time in which these messages could be received by the several sets of antenna and tape recording machines in the missile . Three minutes later , it was estimated , the Atlas came within range of the radio station at Fort Huachuca , There electronic devices sought to trigger the recorder to play back its messages . The Atlas ' receivers worked . The transmitter worked . And the recorder did go into action , it was evident from the responses recorded on the ground . But the message was garbled . Admiral Clark explained why the military was interested in. the communications experiment . It has been realized for some time that the ordinary commercial radio and TV channels are crowded , and some new means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications effectiveness is so vital .
