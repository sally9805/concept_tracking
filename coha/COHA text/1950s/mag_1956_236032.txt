One day this week , a couple of National League ball clubs will probably play the big game , the one that will wrap up the pennant . For the Brooklyn Dodgers , that final accounting , however it adds up , could seem like just another statistic . The Dodgers have played their big game . They played it as they should have , at home on Sept. 19 , against the molting St. Louis Cardinals . The hero , as he should have been , was a lantern-jawed , beetle-browed pitcher named Don Newcombe . <P> For one wonderful afternoon , at a time when the Dodgers seemed determined to outbungle the opposition and give away the flag , Brooklyn suddenly put on an exhibition of big-league baseball . Almost every regular got a hit , and Big Newk led the pack . While he held the Cards to two measly runs , the shambling fireballer walloped back-to-back homers his first two times at bat . Then he hit a clean single ; a few minutes later he got his big feet churning and stole second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add up the score , the Dodgers had won , 17-2 . Big Newk had won his 25th game , the first Dodger to do so since Dazzy Vance in 1924 . <P> Later on , when even the World Series is just another set of numbers in the record book , the Dodgers will have time to muse on their unlovely , late-season staggers . But long after they have forgotten the men left on base , the muffed bunts , all the flubbed chances to put a close game on ice , they will remember Newk on the 19th . This was the kind of performance that makes legend-the legend of one man seemingly determined to do it all by himself .
