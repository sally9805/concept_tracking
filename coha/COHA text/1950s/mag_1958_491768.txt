PART ONE When I said good-by to the staff at the White House on April 20 , 1945 , I really had given very little thought to the fact that from this day forward I would be on my own . Of course , I knew there would be many important changes in my way of living , but I had long since realized that life is made up of a series of adjustments . If you have been married for forty years and if your husband has been President of the United States for a dozen years , you have made personal readjustments many times , some superficial , some fundamental . My husband and I had come through the years with an acceptance of each other 's faults and foibles , a deep understanding , warm affection and agreement on essential values . We depended on each other . Because my husband could not walk , I was accustomed to doing things which most wives would expect their husbands to do ; the planning of the mechanics of life centered around his needs , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's needs as well . Now , leaving the White House for the last time . I had to face the future as countless other women have faced it without their husbands . I had few definite plans , but I knew there were certain things I did not want to do . I did not want to run an elaborate household again . I did not want to cease trying to be useful in some way . I did not want to Icel old  --  and I never have . In the years since 1945 I have known the various phases of loneliness which arc bound to face people who no longer have a busy family life . But I have made the necessary adjustments to a different way of living , and I have enjoyed almost every minute of it and almost everything about it . . I lead a busy life . It is complicated in some ways because my working hours arc long , I travel a great deal and see many people . but in another way I live very simply  --  so simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often surprised to find that I can plan the meals , do some of the shop . ping and serve dinner for a dozen guests with a " staff " consisting of only one maid and an occasional temporary helper . In New York City , I live alone in a four . room apartment in the East Sixties . One of the two bedrooms has been converted into my office . The other one I have had divided into two small bedrooms , so that I can have an occasional overnight guest . The living room also serves as a dining room , but it is not large enough to accommodate a dining-room table . Since I usually have luncheon or dinner guests four or five times a week when I am in New York , I solve the dining problem by setting up a folding table in the living room or , if necessary , several smaller t.ililes that can be easily removed after the meal I t is sometimes a little crowded , because I have served as many as sixteen persons for dinner there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my small garden , where we arc shaded by a neighbor 's tree that leans over the high brick wall in friendly fashion . When I say that I live in rather simple fashion I do not mean that everything always goes smoothly . It does n't . There was the occasion not long ago , for example , when I announced that I was reserving " a few quiet minutes " before dinner for a chat with two old friends  --  Lady Reading , who had just arrived from England , and Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from a trip to Africa . We had hardly seated ourselves when the doorbell rang . The maid answered , but a few moments later she called my granddaughter to the door . Then I could hear a confused babble of voices and , finally . I went to see what was wrong . There was a young boy in the hall wearing a bathrobe  --  and obviously nothing else ! Furthermore , he spoke only French , When I questioned him , he said he was staying in the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall fir some reason , the wind blew the door shut behind him and locked him out . I sent the inlaid to find the janitor , but she reported that he was away . Then , suddenly , the boy cried , " Oh , madame ! I left the water running in the bathtub and it will flood the floor ! " Yes , I thought , and it will all come down into my apartment ! At that moment , Governor Stevenson came to the door , saying that he could no longer stand the suspense and wanted to know what was wrong . When we explained . he rose to the emergency by dashing down into the ba.sement and turning .111 die knobs he could find , in an effort to shut olf the water fur the entire building . Meantime , we sent around the corner for a locksmith . By the time he arrived ? Governor Stevenson had acknowledged a certain lack of success as a plumber , but the locksmith managed to open the door of the boy 's apartment before we were flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did interfere with my " few quiet minutes " with my guests . I do n't normally have many quiet minutes in the day . I get up around seven-thirty in the morning . At breakfast I read the newspapers . Then I work out the menus for the day and write instructions in " the cook 's book " Occasionally . I like to shop in New York and I have found half a dozen little stores where I think I can gel the best cheeses or vegetables or cakes . But It u.11ly the maid does the shopping after reading what I have written in " the cook 's book , " which is a day-by-day journal in which I jot down instructions . A typical page looks like this : SATURDAV , August 9 : Marie ( my maid ) do not come in until ? .

" Fle did n't see me take it , did he ? " " Well , you gol to tell him , do n't you ? ' Cause he 's bound to find out its gone . " Ben looked mighty sick . " You wo n't tell him , will sou , Jimmy ?

I hen he wan &; red around the camp , keeping as far as possible from the Frankfort wagon , where he figured an explosion was due most any time now . In0%U:this he ended up squatting beside Buff , who was sitting in the shade of a wagon exchanging grunts and hand talk with Wolf Runner . Buff grinned at him . " Wolf Runner here had himself a nap a few minutes ago an ' dreamed a queer dream . Said he dreamed he seen a couple of white young'uns playin ' in the river like they was beaver . Only they was so anxious to git at their game they plumb forgot to take off their clothes , so they ?

" Jimmy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't said a word about not telling Butt So he told Buff though first he made Buff promise he would n't tell Mr. Frankfon . Buff scowled and shook his head . " That 's a bad thing , boy , Malin ' a gun an ' goin ' hunt in ' on yore lonesome . You an Ben should n't of done it . " " 1 know that now , " Jimmy said contritely . " But what 's Mr. Frankfort going to do to Ben o hen he finds out the rifle 's gone ? " " The world'li bring you trouble enough , without you go borrowin ' somebody else 's . Ben made his bed , now he kin lie in it . Jest you let this be a lesson to you . " Right then . Jimmy saw Mr. Frankfort climb out of his wagon , call sharply to Ben and talk to him for a spell . There was n't much doubt what they were talking about because Mr. Frankfort kept gesturing at the wagon and Ben kept shaking his head violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon and pick up the bullwhip lying on the scat . He felt kind of sick . But instead of walking hack to the rear of the wagon and going to work on Ben , Mr , Frankfort called out something to a ? man working nearby , turned and walked across camp toward the spot where Jimmy , Buff and Wolf Runner were sitting . Buff grunted something to Wulf Runner and they both got to their feet . " I 'll mince no words , Shelley ! " Mr. Frankfort snapped . " A brand-new Henry rifle belonging to me has been stolen ! Tell your titles ing Crow friend I want it back  --  and quick ! " All work in camp ceased . As the crowd gathered around Mr. Frankfort , all eyes were on the tall , silent Crow and the stony-faced white man who stood beside him . Jimmy shot a look at Ben , who had followed his father and was now standing staring glassy-eyed at Wolf Runner . it 's him or me , Ben must be thinking . and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're barkin ' up the wrong tree , Frankfort . Wolf Runner did n't steal yore rifle . " " Then some of his people did . " " You 're wrong there too . " -I 'm not asking your opinion . I 'm telling you . You vouched for him . But the rifle is gone , Now I want you to tell him that I 'm going to have him tied up and guarded until the gun is returned lo mc . He knows where his people have gone and who stole it . He can tell you and you can ride after them . " Mr. Frankfort paused , letting the coils of the whip drop free of ilk hand until the popper trailed in the dust . " Give him my message . " Mr. Frankfort beckoned to the men standing behind him . " Joe , Frank , Ligc , Ned , seize this Indian and tic him up , Maybe a touch of the whip will make him admit the truth  --  even to his soft-hearted friend . " The four men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You lay hands on Wolf Runner , you 'll buy yore-self a bigger hunk of trouble than you kin cat .

But when I ride out of this camp Wolf Runner is ridin ' with me . Any man tries to lay a hand on him is gum ' to have big trouble with me . " Jimmy 's mother had joined the crowd and was standing with an arm around him , looking on with a puzzled light in her eyes . He felt weak clean down to his toes . He knew that all he would have to do would be point a linger and say one word and Ben would blubber out the whole story . Or Buff could do it . But they had both promised . " Men , " Mr. Frankfurt said , " I gave you an order . Carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men muttered , " It 's your gun and your quarrel , Frankfort . Reckon we 'll let you kill your own snakes . " Mr. Frankfort went livid . " That 's just what I will do ! " he exclaimed , and raised the whip , Jimmy heard his mother gasp . He saw Buff grab the upraised arm and twist the whip out of Mr. Frankfort 's hand . Stumbling backward . Mr. Frankfort fell to the ground . For a moment lie lay there ; then , cursing Buff with words Jimmy had never known cooed , he leaped to his feet and charged Buff . There came a sharp , pistol-like crack as Buff 's right fist landed ; then Mr. Frankfort sagged to the ground . Rubbing his knuckles and looking sorrowful , Buff turned to Jimmy 's mother and said awe . ogetically , " Shore hated to do that , ma'am , but it did n't seem Wen language fer a lady er young boys to listen to . " Then he went over to Ben Frankfon , put an arm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blubber , son . C'tnen , we 'll go down to the river an ' you kin show me whar you lost it , Wolf Runner here is one half beaver an ' ' other half fish . He 'll find the fool thing fer you . " While they were gone , Jimmy went back to the wagon with his mother and told her the whole story . He expected to get a good scolding but , when he was done , she did n't have a word to say . She just stood gazing off into the distance with a funny kind of look in her eye , and when Ben . Wolf Runner and Buff came back to camp a while later with the rifle , she still had that look . Buff walked over , took off his hat and stood sheepishly before her . " Mrs. Coleman , " he said finally , " I s'poseJimmy'salready told sou , but  - -  -  . " " Yes , he 's told me .

But Iwal , I wanted you to know how things are with us men . An ' if there 's any blame to be laid  - -  -  " Jimmy 's mother shook her head . There was a glow in her eyes , a gentle kind of glow that Jimmy could n't remember having seen there since his father had died . " You men ! " she scolded , as if she did n't mean to scold at all .

On ) iv Own ( Continued from Page 21 ) American Association for the United Nations , where I am a volunteer in charge of organization work , my secretary is Miss Patricia Baillergeon , who accompanies me when I trascl for that organizatton . On my lecture tours and other journeys , Miss Corr often goes along because I must find time to do my column and also a monthly page for a magazine . I dictate my column , which Miss Con takes down on the typewriter . Then f correct a and she puts it in final shape for the messenger who comes each day before two o'clock . 1 usually try to arrive at my office at the A.A.U.N. by ten o'clock . In the early 1950 's , when I was a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations , I often had to be present for a meeting as early as nine o'clock , but that proved so difficult that for a while I grist : up my apartment and moved into a hotel in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office there is always some routine work in connection with organizing new chapters  --  we had thirty when I look the job , but now we base about 200 ? and sometimes there is a meeting which I must attend in the afternoon . I try to get back to the apartment for luncheon , if possible , and then in the afternoon I usually have errands to run , or friends to see , or perhaps a meeting of the board of some organization in which I am active . But , if not , I start work on the mail . I receive an average of about IOU letters a day from relatives , friends and  --  mostly  --  from strangers . Virtually all of them arc answered . but obviously that is a task that requires good organization . Miss Corr or Mrs. Upright opens all except my personal letters , and they are able to draft answers to most of them because they arc familiar with what I would say . I have been forced to make certain rules in regard to these letters , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , there arc always a number of requests for autographs . I can provide that merely by answering the letter . But others ask for a photograph , which I never send . Still others want some kind of contribution . " My church is having a fair . Would you send some little gift we can sell ? " or " Would you please send me an autographed copy of your book for our club to auction ? " or " 1 am trying to collect clothes for a needy family of ten whose house burned down . Can you help ? " To all of these 1 point out that I receive so many requests of this nature that I would have to hire a large staff just to wrap and mail packages if I responded . So I send nothing . Then there are other letters , asking for advice . Perhaps a woman writes that her husband is in jail and wants me to recommend a lawyer . Or I am asked for advice in regard to handling disobedient children or for the name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such advice or make such recommendations , but we always try to point out to such correspondents the various reputable organizations to which they can go for assistance or guidance . By the time my secretaries base drafted answers to these letters there are probably only a dozen or fifteen left for me to read and answer . I go through them at odd times , whenever I have the opportunity , and scribble a note indicating the proper reply . Then , usually in the evenings , when all the letters have been typed , I read all the answers and sign them all . Many times , especially if I have guests or go out during the evening , I am still signing at one o'clock in the morning , I do n't have to stamp the letters that arc going to towns or cities in the United States because all wives of forma Presidents have the franking privilege , but I must pay for stamps for the large number of letters that I send abroad . Of course , I do not spend all of my time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of miles I vasel a year , but during the winter I am on the road at least one week and perhaps two weeks of every month , including fairly regular trips abroad . Many of my trips to deliver lectures or to work for the A.A.U.N. are quick ones , because whenever I have to speak at a luncheon or a dinner I try to arrange it so I can go by plane , arriving just in time to keep MY engagement , and then return the same evening or at least early the next morning . I do not grow weary of travel and I do not tire easily  --  not so easily as some younger people I know . Sometimes , it is true , my feet hurt . That is mainly a result , the doctors tell me , of a slight change in the bones in al instep that ( Continued on Page 681 was caused by years of standing at men-lions in the White 1-louse . When I II  --  VC to rest I blame it on my " White House feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an opportunity to catch up on my reading , In fact , I do most of my reading for pleasure on airplanes because at home there seldom seem ' , to he time to pick up the many bottks th ; s1 interest rne . Incidentally , if I have a complaint about the kind of life I lead , that is it  --  I simply can not find time to read as much as I wish . Anyone who travels a lot knows what it means to encounter unexpectedly someone you base met years before and be unable to remember his name . But I doubt that anyone hears as often as I do the question ; " Do n't you remember me , Mrs. Roosevelt ' ? " A typical incident occurred one evening : titer I had spoken in a Western city . A man came up to me with the inevitable question as to whether 1 remembered him . " Oh , dear , " I exclaimed , " I know I 've seen you somewhere , but I really ca n't recall . " Whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flourished it before my eyes . It included a photograph of myself and this gentleman  --  when he was a marine in a hospital in New Zealand in 1943 ! I was happy to tell him that I clearly remembered my skit to the hospital . Another time I heard the same question from a man who attended one of my lectures  --  I girt about 100 lectures a year  --  except that he said , " Do n't you remember that time in New Guinea ? " " Why , I 've never been in New Guinea , " I replied . " ' I call , that 's right , " he said , " It was n't New Guinea . But I was in the Army in New Guinea and I came hack to a rest camp in Northern Australia and 1 sat at your table one night at dinner . I 'm a miner from West Virginia and I remember what you said about the coal-mine strike going on then in West Virginia . " I did remember then . I had been warned by my sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get away from the brass and talk to the soldiers . So each morning I went alone to breakfast in the mess tent , standing in line and then sitting alone at a table . Always . after a short time , one or two soldiers would move over to my table to talk , and then more and more would gather around . It was a wonderful experience , and I remembered the West Virginian because he had been the first to come to my table to discuss the coal strike and to talk about POST whether strikes were justifiable in wari Still another such incident took place in a taxicab in New York recently . When the cab stopped for a red light , the driver turned around and wondered if I remembered him . I did n't because I must confess that a great many young men in uniform look very much alike or 41 least you remember them as looking alike , " Well , I 'm the guy who cooked lunch for you at Born-Bora , " he said , No wonder lie felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island outpost in the Pacific , and so isolated that if you once see a person there you should remember him forever . I certainly remembered going around the island in a jeep and eating with a small group of soldiers who were stationed there to watch for enemy submarines , which were seldom sighted . It was a dull and lonely assignment and a visit by anyone was an event to be remembered , speeially if you cooked luncheon for your guest . It is n't always easy for me to remember them . but I 'm always glad when they speak to me . Having many people in my life , going many places and doing many things has helped me to adjust to a new way of living since 1945 . I think , too , that the process of change has been made easier by the fact that I still hare a cottage at Hyde Park , where the big house had always been " home " to my husband and our children . As I have said , I had been accustomed to handling many family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely on others to keep his own life going the way he wished and to fulfill his daily needs . He had to hale a good man to help him get ready for the day and for bed at night . This man was always on call . It was a tremendous business to plan a trip for him to visit the boys at school or college , so , except for very important occasions , I did the traveling . Because he never traveled alone , even to the office , he never carried any money . So the rest of us had to be sure we had money to pay for whateser was needed when he was away from the house . Thus the necessities of life had thrown me largely on my own resources . Whether we were in the White House or in Hyde Park , the household had to be run , although frequently it was not run to everybody 's satisfaction , In a large family , there arc always different likes and dislikes and different points of view on how to do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was my mother-in- februnry law 's home . She lived there and ran it . She had rigid ideas about how things should be done . When we came at first we were her guests  --  although I ca n't say that my inishaild ever felt or behaved like a guest . Anyone who has ever run a large household may imagine the conflicts that sometimes arose between people accustomed to different conditions . I was the mediator who somehow had to see that things ran smoothly . It was not always easy . In certain ways , my husband was very much like his mother . Both of them could be completely obstinate , and I often found it advisable not to leave them too long alone if there was any controversial subject that might come up . Fifteen minutes was just about as long as it was safe for them to he uninterruptedly together . Yet nothing seemed to disturb the deep , underlying affection they had for each other . There was another aspect of life at Hyde Park which was difficult . My mother-in-law and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County family , knowing their neighbors in the other big houses along the I iudson River , knowing also the people in the village and the people on the farms , This was a graceful way of life , but it was becoming outdated because every year it became more difficult to get and train servants and otherwise to maintain a big estate . The greater difficulty as far as 1 was concerned , howeser , arose from the fact that when my husband decided to take an active part in politics his mother was not prepared for this change . I shall never forget the first dinner when Alfred F. Smith , then the governor of New York , sat beside my moiher-mlaw . He might be a man of ability and statesmanship , but to her he was a " species " that she had never come across before  --  proud of his background on the lower East Side of New York City . proud of having worked in the Fulton Fish Market . but certainly lacking the cultivated voice and the manners that she was accustomed tn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that my mother-in-law did not entirely approve of the gentleman on her right . She approved even less another day when Huey Long . then governor of Louisiana , was Franklin 's guest at luncheon . He sat on Franklin 's right and there was a long table of guests separating him from my mother-in-law . Our daughter , Anna , was about halfway down the table and I sat across from her . Suddenly , we heard my mother-in-law ask in what we knew was purposely a very loud whisper . " Who is that awful man nest to my son ? " Socially , Governor Long may have seemed " awful " to her , but politically he was then an important figure to Franklin . Anna and 1 burst into loud conversation simultaneously , hoping that the governor had not caught the remark . Luckily , he seemed not to notice it , but incidents of this kind were not always easy to cover up . Looking back now . I think I had long been preparing for the personal adjustMents that came with my husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1 could make decisions . On the long trip from Warm Springs . Georgia , before my husband 's funeral in the White House . I had made certain dzcisions . I wanted to leave the White House as soon as possible . I did not want to live in the big house at Hyde Park . These things I decided as the train wheels jolted on during the night . But what would the children feel ? Thcy loved the Hyde Park house . Their grandmother had made them feel that it was their Permanent home . How would it seem to have it swept out of their lives ? For myself , I knew I would live in the cottage I had made out of my furniture factory on Val-Kill Creek , two miles back from the big house at Hyde Park . The land was my husband 's , but he had given a life interest in a small acreage lo me and my friends , Nancy Cook and Marion I lickerrnan , when we started a factory to make reproductions of early-American furniture . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user the cottage without benefit of architect . but with the help of a practical engineer , Henry Osthagen . My office was there , as was the apartment of my secretary , Miss Malvina Thompson , There was a small apartment for a couple who work for me , two living rooms , a dining room , seven bedrooms , a dormitory for young guests and a large porch . The cottage has no architectural beauty , but it suits my needs and we had built a ass imming pool and an outdoor fireplace and there was plenty of room for picnics . It was mine and I felt freer there than in the big house . My son , Elliott . then a brigadier general in the Army Air Force flying axon- 11 , ( 1 naissance missions over Germany , was the only boy to get home for the funeral . Franklin , Jr. , was commanding a destroyer escort in the Pacific war zone , and John was on an aircraft carrier in the same area .

It was not until the next day that James discovered in a safe some Pour papers addressed to him by his father , including a letter of direetions about arrtingCMCIIIS for his funeral . We had not done exactly what he wanted . I fear I had followed my own inclinations , bolstering them by some casual remarks I had heard my husband make which were not his real judgment . I felt guilty and sad , but the funeral was over . And except for the fact that he would have had his coffin go to the Capitol in Washington , where he would he in stale , all the details were as he wished . I had a horror of 1r ing in state and thought he agreed with me about it . In his will , my husband had left the place at Hydc Park to me and to our children through our lives , if we desired to live there . At our deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government . But he also left a private letter to me saving he dal not think we could afford to run the place and advising me to urge the children to give the big house to the Government at once . He wrote that his experience with the homes of other Presidents had made it clear that visitors would make private life difficult . Characteristically , he remarked that he would hate to think of us taking refuge in the attic or the cellar in search of privacy . 1 was very glad when the children decided to join with me in turning the big place over to the Gosernment as soon as it could be arranged . I also soon found that I had better liquidate the farm at Hyde Park , since it was being run with doubtful efficiency . While I had my own daughter and three daughters-in-law and two sons v. all mc , 1 arranged for di ' moon of jewelry and furs , including all that which had been designated for me from his mother 's estate .

There were some things I would need in my new way of life and that belonged to me . But . somehow . possessions seemed of little importance , and they grew less important with the years . My feeling that it is a mistake to hoard possessions was confirmed when I discovered under the eases of the Hyde Park attic some bolts of Chinese silk . They probably had belonged to Mrs. Paul Forbes , my mother-in-law 's sister , and had been literally " put under the plank , " as she called it . But when I found them hidden away under the cases they had been hopelessly ruined .

My philosophy has been that if you have work to do and do it to the best of your ability , you will not have so much time to think about yourself . I had a great deal to do , and I would have felt the lack of secretarial help if President Truman had not realized the burden and lent us Miss Dorothy Dow . She helped Miss Thompson all through the summer , reading all the letters which came at the time of my husband 's death and answering as many as we could . Nine cases of these letters are now in the library at Hydc Park . Some of them actually give the life histories of the people who wrote them and document the value of some of the New Deal projects which saved so many people from utter despair in the early days of my husband 's presidency .

But when winter came we still had nothing else . except a small work truck , and Miss Thompson and I must have been an odd sight on the many occasions when we wrapped ourselves in all the rugs we could find to keep from freezing as we drove between Hyde Park and Ncw York City .

Luckily , my husband had left me two life-insurance policies . I used their proceeds while awaiting settlement of the estate of around $1,000 , 000 . Then I had to make another decision , I could live on what my husband had left me and stop working , Or I could continue to work and pay approximately all I inherited to the Government in taxes , since in any event I would be in a high tax bracket . Of course , I decided to go on working . In my new position . however . I could no longer give my earnings 10 people or organizations in which I was interested , because of the tax laws . I had to establish a charity fund into which I put all earnings from lectures , which amounts to about 20 to 30 per cent of my income . The laws permit me to give that much to tax-exempt charities , educational institutions , hospitals and churches . I live on what I earn by writing , appearing on radio or television and reading manuscripts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these earnings total somewhat more than I spend in living expenses , and it is a good thing they do , because all the income from my inheritances and more besides is required to pay my annual tax bills . The first year after my husband 's death was such a busy one that 1 had little time to feel alone . Man ) persons  --  Princess Juliana of the Netherlands , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , Ambassador and Madame Andrei Gromyko , General and Mrs. Eisenhower  --  came to call at Hyde Park . And , particularly in summer , my children and grandchildren , nieces , great-nephews and others were there . Among other aCtIvit les , as summer turned to autumn , I had a great deal of Christmas shopping to do . In addition to five children , I now have nineteen grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren , and it has long been my custom to shop for a hristmas presents throughout the entire year . Wherever I may be in January or June or November , I am always picking up some small gift that 1 think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following December twenty-fifth . These packages I stow away in - the Christmas closet " for safekeeping , and it is likely to become pretty crowded by December , although occasionally I can not resist opening it ahead of time to give one of the children a present that is particularly appropriate . Since 1935 1 have kept a Christmas Book , a journal in which I list what I gave relatives and friends on each Christmas over the years . The book is now about two inches thick and , counting friends and people who have worked for us in the past , it contains more than 200 names . But , of course , many of these gifts are mere tokens  --  usually maple sugar or honey in recent years  --  to persons who have done thoughtful things for me  --  Madame Pandit , Prime Minister Nehru , the Trumans , Princess Margaret , Bernard Baruch , Marshal Tito and his wife . Christmas that first year probably would have been at difficult time had not my son , Elliott , and his wife decided to live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three miles from the big house at Hyde Park , Elliott was going to try to farm  --  he soon discovered this was impractical at Hyde Park Liam you worked the hind yourself  --  hut it was his companionship and that of his wife and children that made the first Christmas a natural , happy family reunion . Without Elliott it would have been a very sad time and I shall always be grateful to him and to his wife for the help they gave me that autumn and winter . The real point at which outer readjustments seemed to culminate was on April 12 , 1946 , when we turned the big house over to the United States Government at a ceremony attended by President Truman . In a speech at that time , I told how Franklin had pictured the estate , under Federal auspices , as a place to which the people of our own country and even of the world might come to draw from it rest and peace and strength as he had done . I said I had no regrets in turning it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children and grandchildren might now learn about their illustrious ancestor in a way that would hase been impossible had they lived on in the old house . Then , too , it was better to pass on the house and its contents just as it had been left by my husband , so that it might not take on any of the personality of those who might have made it their home after his death . " His spirit , " I added . " will always live in this house , in the library and in the rose garden where he wished his grave to be . " Readjustments in one 's inner life to go on forever . I think , but my main decisions probably were accepted by the end of the first year The only one who never really readjusted was Fala , my husband 's little dog , Once in 1945 when General Eisenhower came to lay a wreath on Franklin 's grave , the gates of the regular driveway were opened and his automobile approached the house , accompanied by the wailing sirens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he heard the sirens his legs straightened out , his cars pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming dow n the drive . Later , when we were living in the cottage , he always lay near the dining-room door , where he could watch both entrances just as he had done so often when his master was there . Franklin was in the habit of suddenly deciding to go somewhere , and Fab had to watch both entrances to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice . Fala accepted me after my husband 's death , but 1 was just someone to put up with until the master should return . Many dogs eventually forget . I felt that Fala never really forgot . Whenever he heard the sirens he became alert and he felt again that he was an important being , just as he had felt when he was traveling with my husband . Fala is buried now in the rose garden at Hyde Park . and I hope he is no longer troubled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
