Desperate Moment ( J. Arthur Rank ; Universal-International ) tries to do for West Berlin what The Third Man did so successfully for Vienna . Refugee Dirk Bogarde has confessed to a murder he did not commit because he thinks he has nothing left to live for . But as soon as he begins serving his life term , his long-lost girl friend ( Mai Zetterling ) turns up . Breaking out of jail to clear his name , Bogarde is hounded through the rubble-strewn ruins by the police and matches wits with skulking black-marketeers . The film fails because its events are too predictable for suspense , its hero and heroine too coldly competent for sympathy , and its villain ( Albert Lieven ) too inept to generate excitement . <P> Mr. Scoutmaster ( 20th Century-Fox ) enacts one more battle in Clifton Webb 's long movie war with children . Perhaps because he is opposed this time by as potent an organization as the Boy Scouts , Webb is considerably more mellow than in his Mr. Belvedere days : he strikes only one urchin ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon loses his heart to a frog-voiced eight-year-old ( George Winslow ) . Webb takes over an unruly troop of Scouts because , as a writer of TV children 's shows , he thinks he should know more about the spaceship set . <P> The film milks a few laughs by dressing Webb up as a scoutmaster and turning him loose on an overnight hike with his irreverent charges . Unfortunately , the whole thing soon turns from slapstick to sentiment as Webb and his wife ( Frances Dee ) decide to adopt Master Winslow . Edmund Gwenn does his twinkling best as a clergyman in on the plot to make a child-lover of Webb . <P> Mr. Denning Drives North ( Carroll ) is a better-than-average British thriller . John ( Great Expectations ) Mills , a successful jet-aircraft designer , suddenly begins to neglect his work , takes to drink , and wakes up screaming from nightmares . When he attempts suicide by crashing his plane , his wife ( Phyllis Calvert ) has it out with him , learns that he has accidentally killed an unsavory admirer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mills is not so much the killing as the fact that the dead man 's body ( which he had thrown in a ditch to make it seem a hit &; run accident ) has mysteriously disappeared . <P> With his wife 's help , Mills sets out to look for the missing corpse , discovers that the body was robbed and buried by a passing gypsy . His daughter 's new suitor , a U.S. patent lawyer ( Sam Wanamaker ) , gets idealistically involved in the case and , in clearing the gypsy of murder , relentlessly involves his future father-in-law in the crime . What is good about the film is the full-bodied characterization of the killer as a man willing to compromise - but only up to a certain point-to save his own life . Its chief surprise is an ending calculated to stun moviegoers accustomed to Hollywood 's sin-must-be-punished production code .
