U.S. car buyers who still shop with an eye on fuel economy last week got an idea which cars can stretch a gallon the farthest . In the Fifth Annual Mobilgas Economy Run , experts drove 20 competing stock models from every major U.S. automaker over 1,335 miles of some of the ruggedest roads in the U.S. , and made every drop of gas count . <P> At an average speed of 41.1 m.p.h. , the cars rolled from Los Angeles to Fresno , through the Sierras to Yosemite National Park and San Francisco , up across snowbound mountains to Elko , Nev. , and three days later into Sun Valley , Idaho . Most drivers had the road plotted with military precision , knew just how fast to take each hill , just how to time themselves to miss gas-gobbling traffic lights . ( One driver hit only five red lights on the entire run . ) Every car finished , and the only unplanned halt was in a howling blizzard at California 's 7,135-ft . Donner Pass . <P> The big winner : Studebaker , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low-priced field ( $1,500 to $2,050 f.o.b. factory ) , a six-cylinder Studebaker Champion beat out two Fords ( the low-price winner for four years ) , a Plymouth and a Chevrolet , clicked off the run at an average 29.58 miles per gallon . Studebaker 's bigger V-8 Land Cruiser won the upper-medium-price ( $2,401 to $3,000 ) field for automatic transmission cars with 24.57 m.p.g. , and the same car with standard transmission and overdrive won the sweepstakes grand prize by lightfooting it over the course at 28.1 m.p.g. for the best ton-mile record of all . <P> Other winners : Hudson Jet ( 21.63 m.p.g. ) in the low-priced field with automatic drive ; Dodge Royal V-8 ( 25.39 m.p.g. ) in the low-medium field with standard transmission ; Oldsmobile 88 ( 19.75 m.p.g. ) in the low-medium field with automatic drive ; Lincoln Capri ( 19.75 m.p.g. ) in the high-priced field .
