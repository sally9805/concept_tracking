txt The Soviet Union released today what it said was man 's first picture of the hidden side of the moon . Eight of the hazy dark spots shown in the single picture re ? leased were promptly given names by a specially appointed committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences . One of the largest was a depression said to be 187 miles across . It was called the Moscow Sea . The picture was transmitted by the official press agency . Tass , to its bureaus throughout the World , published in Moscow 's two principal newspapers , Pravda and Izvestia , and shown to Soviet viewers over the Moscow television network . Other Pictures Taken The picture shown today was one of a " considerable number " that Tass said the Soviet Union 's latest lunar rocket had taken twenty days ago as it soared past . the far side of the moon . What does the other side of the moon look like ? Here is what the photograph showed in part : A vast white area with darker shadings covering most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern hemisphere . The boundary of this shadow was named by the Soviet scientists the Soviet Mountains . In the center of the huge , white area was a large irregular indentation , the one that was named the Moscow Sea . Scientists use the word sea to describe the dry depressions on the surface of the moon facing the earth , and the Russians apparently continued the practice for the far side . In the western sector behind the Soviet Mountains is a group of four round spots , two of which were given names . The other two were said still to be under study for classification , as were ten other clearly de= fined . spots on the unseen surface of the moon . Pravda also showed the far lunar side was mostly covered by mountains . In a broadcast from Mos. cow Monday night , The Associated Press said , a Soviet scientist described the lunar discovery as follows : " The unseen part of the moon is considerably more monotonous than the side turned toward the earth . It ' contains fewer seas and fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Pulkovo Observatory . An earlier announcement said that the 600-pound cosmic vehicle had succeeded in photographing in bright sunlight 70 per cent of the back of the moon , which is eternally hidden from the earth 's view . The announcement also said that the rocket had automatically developed the pictures it had taken during a forty-minute series of exposures and had transmitted them back to Soviet stations shortly before it had reached its perigee , or nearest point to the earth , on Oct. 18 . Tass also released a picture of the space vehicle that had carried ? the complex scientific and photographic equipment into its fantastic elliptical trip more than 600,000 miles aropnd the earth and past the moon 's orbit . The vehicle looked like a big ashcan with a rounded bottom and a truncated conical top from which four fixed antennae bristled . In the center of the top was a large lens  --  the big eye that the Soviet Union asserted had given man his first view of what lay on the other side of the moon . The Tass bulletin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this eye toward the moon when its carrier was zooming through interplanetary space about 37 , - 000 to 43,000 miles from the moon . According to the picture released , the entire back half of the lunar globe appeared to have been in sunlight when the satellite snapped its three-quarter profile . The western quarter of the globe in the picture showed areas that already had been seen from the earth and had been given their classical names ? Humboldt 's Sea ? the Sea of Fertility , the Sea of Crisis . This part of the globe also showed the Marginal Sea , part of which extended into newly photographed area , as did Smyth 's Sea at the moon 's equator , and the Southern Sea at the south of the globe . In fact , part of the photograph showing the areas seen from the earth had by far the larger masses of dark spots . The moon television showing also revealed that one of the indentations in the Moscow Sea had been named Astronauts ' Bay by the Soviet committee . One medium-sized spot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its center was called Tsiolkovsky Hill after the Russian whom the Soviet Union has credited with being the father of rocketry . A huge dark area on the southeastern rim of the globe is called the Sea of Dreams . The two round spots named in - the western sector were named for Frederic Joliot Curie , the late French nuclear scientist , and for Mikhail V. Lomonosov , an eighteenth century Russian scientist . The picture hsowed the moon with its polar axis leaning at about a 60-degree angle to the left from south to north . Considerably more of the northern hemisphere was visible than was the southern hemisphere . With the publication of the picture the Russians promptly proclaimed another triumph for their scientists . Although several pictures were said to have been transmitted back to earth by the lunar rocket , it was considered almost certain that the one distributed throughout the world today was one of the best . The picture of what the Soviet scientists called the automatic interplanetary station had been heavily outlined with a black line by artists . It appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels . At the top of the cylinder was a thick collar that might ! have contained solar batteries to operate the radio and other mechanisms . There wen other protuberances and " windows " on the sides and top of the huge cannister that were not identified . ? The Tass bulletin Issued last night said that the lunar rocket 's flight beyond the moon and the pictures it had produced had proved that Soviet scientists had solved the problem of orienting , or turning in space , a ? cosmic.vehicle by signals from the earth so that the lens would be pointed at the moon when the camera started operating . The bulletin also said that the problem or transmitting halftone photographs of high trial- , ity back to earth by television from cosmic distances had been ' solved . - With the help of a special radio transmission system the satellite sent television photographs through cosmic space as the vehicle approached its closest point to earth . Simultaneously , it transmitted new data that made it possible more accurately to define , the vehicle 's orbit , Tass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the satellite I will last for about six months from the time of its launching ! on Oct. 4 and will have made ) eleven to twelve orbits around the earth before it re-enters the denser layers of the earth 's atmosphere and burns up . This was the first time that Moscow had so specifically asserted that the rocket would not continue indefinitely its sgreat eliptical orbit around the earth , The Tass bulletin said that other scientific data about qualities of space , also received from the vehicle 's transmitting apparatus , still were being studied by Soviet scientists . The Soviet Union has promised to make public the information it has gathered from its lunar probe as soon as all data have been worked out . At 8 P. M. Moscow time tomorrow ( noon in New York ) , the bulletin said ; the satellite will be 300,561 miles - from the center of the earth ' and will be over a point on the ' earth 's - surface with ** 6 degrees 30 minutes N.
