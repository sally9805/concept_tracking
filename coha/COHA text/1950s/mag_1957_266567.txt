Around the tables in Seattle 's posh 410 Restaurant sat some of the top men in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , quietly talking strategy . At one table , the comments were mixed with uneasy hope and stifled distress . There sat two men who had dared to come out against arrogant , front-running Midwest Teamster Czar James Riddle Hoffa , who claimed that he would win the brotherhood 's presidency at the quinquennial convention in Miami Beach , Fla . Sept. 30 . Tom Hickey , longtime New York Teamster enemy of Hoffa , was one ; the other was Tom Haggerty , secretary-treasurer of a milkwagon local in Chicago . At the next table , but out of earshot , was Jimmy Hoffa himself , dining and dealing with a quartet of his cronies . They were Hoffa 's kind of company : one was a longtime Western Conference muscleman ; another was recently convicted of perjury ; of the remaining two , one is noted chiefly for his talent for tearing up telephone books with his bare hands . <P> " Look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Western Conference of Teamsters , who sat with Hickey and Haggerty . " Not a man at this table has ever done anything he needs to be ashamed of . The best thing Jim Hoffa could ever do for the union is to stand up right now and say he 'll withdraw . But there 's no chance of that . " Said Tom Haggerty : " Well , it 's up to us to dignify the name of our union . " Franklin talked of the support behind Hickey and Haggerty and a third anti-Hoffa candidate , California 's Democratic Congressman Jack Shelley of San Francisco , a onetime bakery driver who still pays Teamster dues . " There 's enough for a snowball to get rolling , " he said , " if Hickey , Haggerty and Shelley stand together . " <P> Not Much Experience . The three challengers , as well as Jimmy Hoffa , were in Seattle last week to perform an unusual kind of experiment . The Western Conference 's Franklin had thought up the idea of bringing the candidates for president in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20-man policy committee . " Believe me , " said Franklin before the hearing began , " it 's taken a lot of doing . We still do n't know how well it 's going to work out because , do n't forget , we 've never had much experience in democratic procedure . " <P> Behind closed doors , the meeting droned on for more than three hours . Western Conference Boss Frank Brewster ( who was sentenced to a year in prison last month for contempt of Congress ) , long a Hoffa enemy , wanted to ram through an endorsement of Hoffa . Dave Beck , chins-deep in trouble , * was absent , but the word was around that what little power he has left will be with Hoffa in the hope that President Hoffa would help to make Beck president emeritus ( at $50,000 a year ) . <P> Of the four candidates , Jimmy Hoffa got the biggest hand from his fellow Teamsters . But it was Chicago 's Haggerty , a " clean " union man and a member of the Chicago board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater autonomy for Joint Councils and locals , a bigger General Executive Board with greater powers , an end to ironfisted trusteeships ( from which Jimmy Hoffa has gained much of his muscle ) .
