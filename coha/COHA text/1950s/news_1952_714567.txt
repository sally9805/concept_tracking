London 24th , yesterday approved a proposed ordinance designed to strengthen Chicago 's ragweed control program and afford more relief to hay fever sufferers . The ordinance will come up for passage by the council Thursday .

The new ordinance also would transfer enforcement of the ragweed control program to the department of streets and electricity from the building department . Control Dates Advanced As in the present law , property owners would be required to destroy ragweed twice each season .
