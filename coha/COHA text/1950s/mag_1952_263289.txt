" You do n't really mean you 're still for Eisenhower , " a young British writer said to a U.S. correspondent last week at a London cocktail party . " My God , seriously , old boy , I must convince you . " <P> The remark summarized the feelings of the Western European press on the U.S. campaign . Last July , the victor over Hitler and the boss of SHAPE was the unquestioned favorite . By last week , if Ike had to run in Europe , he would lose hands down-at least in the press . <P> This is particularly true in Britain , where Adlai Stevenson has made a tremendous hit . Reports one U.S. correspondent : " The British ca n't understand how a man who did n't go to Eton could have such facility with words , but they love it . " The Daily Mail 's Don Iddon called Stevenson " dazzling and delightful , " adding : " His manner is more British than American , and this could be a handicap in the U.S.. Already his harassed enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . " Reported the Daily Telegraph 's Malcolm Muggeridge : " He derives from the tradition of Henry Adams , and a century ago might well have preferred to transfer himself across the Atlantic to survey the New World from the Old . " Said the Sunday Times : Stevenson " already has much of the clean-cut loneliness of the great . " <P> The man in the street and in the pub still seems to like Ike and wonder who this chap Stevenson is . But the Laborite Daily Herald says : " Ike has become a pitiful pawn . " The thoughtful Economist , which backed Eisenhower a few months ago , last week worried about Ike 's association with Taft , wondered whether " Eisenhower , the politician , is a different man from Eisenhower , the architect of a united victory . " But , added the Economist , " may the best man win . " <P> Reaction in other capitals is similar . The conservative Paris Figaro recently said ( in a headline ) : " Stevenson appeals to the voters ' reason ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiegel of Stevenson : " A gentleman . " Vienna 's Socialist Arbeiter-Zeitung summed up Socialist opinion last week when it described Truman 's campaign as blowing " like a whirlwind of fresh air through the press , television and statistics . " <P> Greatest tribute to both candidates came from the Communist press , which condemned them both as capitalist lackeys.
