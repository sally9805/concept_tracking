WE speak too often of American collectors who have French or Italian castles transported stone by stone across the Atlantic , " a contrite French art critic wrote last week . Then he added , with an air of surprise : " Robert Lehman , the banker from New York who is currently showing 300 of his treasures at the Orangerie des Tuileries is , truth to tell , an amateur of art with the best of taste . " For once the rest of Paris ' many-hued press was in agreement ; the Louvre 's guest show for the summer was a smash hit and the talk of Paris . Editorialized Carrefour : " We would like the purchases of our museums to be inspired by a taste as severe as that of which M. Robert Lehman today gives us such dazzling evidence . " <P> Bargains to Taste . There was no question about either the dazzle or the taste of the 293 pieces ( valued at $14 million ) chosen for display from the collection 's total of more than 1,000 works . The finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown abroad-the Lehman collection boasts several of the world 's great paintings by Rembrandt , Goya , El Greco , Memling and Petrus Christus ( see color pages ) , includes an eye-stunning array of tapestries . Renaissance furniture , jewelry , enamels , bronzes and even diamond-studded snuff boxes . It represents collecting on a grand scale not likely to be repeated . <P> When the late Philip Lehman , head of Wall Street 's Lehman Bros. , and his wife started collecting in 1911 , they began cautiously by buying a conventional Hoppner , Rembrandt 's Portrait of an Elderly Man , Goya 's Countess Altamira , and two matching portraits by 15th century painter Francesco del Cossa . Their first modest plunge , which today would strain most museum budgets , barely caused a ripple in an art world then dominated by such high , wide spenders as J. Pierpont Morgan , Henry Clay Frick and Benjamin Altman . <P> Staying clear of the High Renaissance masterpieces , the Lehmans on their regular summer trips to Europe sought out bargains to their taste , rapidly expanded the collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters ( including the prize of the collection , Petrus Christus ' The Legend of St. Eligius and St. Godeberta , bought for $144,000 in 1921 ) , filled it in with matching period pieces of Renaissance furniture , tapestries and majolica plates . Robert Lehman , who as a boy accompanied his parents on their art forays , exults : " It was a fascinating way to get an education ! " <P> Young Robert became a confirmed art enthusiast while he was still at Yale ( ' 13 ) , steered his parents ' tastes toward Italian primitives ( works by Sassetta and Giovanni di Paolo are among the collection 's current high points ) , began collecting hand-painted illuminations and drawings . In 1929 he proved his taste with a birthday present to his father : Botticelli 's exquisite , miniature Annunciation . <P>
