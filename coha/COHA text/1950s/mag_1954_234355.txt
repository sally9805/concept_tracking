The Woman Who Was No More is an offbeat French mystery . It has no hero , and its principal character is an intellectual pygmy who is as real as mud and just as unenterprising . His creators , French Authors Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac , have built him into the base of a very French triangle of adulterous villains and victims . They make of it a crisply written , ingenious novel of suspense that is calculated to grip a reader right up to its sardonic last line . <P> The pygmy is a traveling salesman named Fernand Ravinel who has the face of a brute and the soul of a sparrow . His mistress , Dr. Lucienne Mogard. is as cold and sharp as a scalpel . When they entice Ravinel 's wife Mireille to Nantes , their object is murder and their motive is 2,000,000 francs of insurance money . As a killer , Ravinel proves tender and compassionate . After Mireille drinks a carefully prepared potion , her eyes close and Ravinel tearfully helps to lower her inert body into a bathtub full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says .
