The New York Times 's station WQXR is one of the few gentle havens in radio 's jingle-jangle jungle . No giveaways , soap operas , rock'n'roll or singing commercials mar its well-mannered purr of good music , mostly classical . But as WQXR reaped prestige , it also reaped advertisers-so many , in fact , that its listeners began to complain . One of the complainants : Listener No. 1 , Times Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger . Upshot : this season WQXR has invoked what it believes to be the first commercial cutback in broadcasting history , is eliminating all one-minute spots following sponsored programs ( representing a $150,000 annual " loss " ) , also will carry only one brief commercial in the two hours on Saturday nights when the Boston Symphony plays .
