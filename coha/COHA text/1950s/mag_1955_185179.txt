The candidate 's flushed face wore a beatific smile . He elbowed his way through the pressing crowd in the Congressional Room of Washington 's Willard Hotel , stepped onto a platform and picked up a coonskin cap . He put it on , took it off , waved it , put it back , took it off again , tossed it aside . He enthroned himself in a large chair in front of a head photograph of himself that measured five feet from groomed hair to fighting jaw . Then Estes Kefauver , in his familiar , prim drawl , began to read : " I have received much encouragement , particularly from the rank-and-file members of the party . I therefore announce my candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination at the convention to be held in Chicago next August . " <P> Rank &; File Strength . Since Kefauver 's vote-getting reputation rests almost solely on his showing in the 1952 primaries , reporters ' questioning centered on his plans for next year 's contests . Would he enter the California primary in a head-on collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-day trip to California , said he had promised his followers to run there if he ran at all . What about Minnesota ? Said Kefauver : " Well , I concede that things are pretty well stacked against me , apparently , but I have been receiving an awful lot of requests from rank-and-file people to enter . I will have to evaluate whether I have enough rank-and-file strength to offset the big bloc of political strength which has gotten behind Mr. Stevenson . " <P> Does he intend to file in New Hampshire , where his 1952 win over President Truman gave him perhaps his finest hour ? His grinning reply : " I heard somewhere or another that my political associates were already getting their snowshoes out . " And Florida ? Said Kefauver : " The sunshine is very beautiful in Florida this time of year . " <P> Trouble with Postcards . The limiting factor , said Kefauver , is money . He explained in his best patched-pants style : " When I was out in California the other day , somebody told me that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California costs at least $115,000-one postal card . So that this campaigning has gotten to be very , very expensive . . . I do not have the money available and I do not know where I am going to get funds from . I do have reason to feel that some people will help me ... " Kefauver was asked what differences might arise between him and other Democratic hopefuls . Said he : " I do not expect at this time to try to point out the differences between the attitudes , for instance , of Mr. Stevenson or Harriman or Lausche or others , on public issues , as compared with my own position . These gentlemen are all vocal and speak frequently , and whatever differences there may be , and the differences that come up in the future , I 'm certain the press and the public will be quick to discern them . " What , Kefauver was asked , makes him think he can win if President Eisenhower runs again ? Kefauver , with just the proper touch of humility , replied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the personal attractiveness that President Eisenhower does . " But , he was quick to add , the difference would be more than made up by the fact that " there is broader and wider and greater strength in the Democratic Party than in the Republican one . "
