One day last week blonde Clara Jo Proudfoot , 4 , of Miami called on the President of the United States . Born with an imperfectly closed spine ( spina bifida ) and paralyzed from the waist down , Clara Jo was promoting the Easter Seal drive of the National Society for Crippled Children and Adults . As he saw the little girl laboriously making her way into his office on heavy steel braces and pink crutches that matched her well-starched dress , the President uttered an involuntary gasp . He started toward the girl as if to pick her up and carry her to his desk , then checked himself and said in a firmly encouraging tone : " That 's a good job , a very good job . " <P> For Ike , Clara Jo had a sheaf of Easter Seals and a lapel pin ; for Clara Jo 's cause Ike had $5 , and for her stuffed dachshund he had an autograph . Pulling open a drawer of his desk , the President looked at the contents and remarked , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Actually , many of them are for the President , e.g. , half a dozen bottles of assorted potions and pills . ) But he found an 1890 ( the year of his birth ) silver dollar and a white ballpoint pen for the girl , and a penknife for her eleven-year-old brother . As the other people who were promoting the cause filed out of the room , the President and the little girl were still rummaging happily in the big drawer . <P> Late &; Long . Throughout the week there were other visitors and other causes . In the White House Rose Garden one grey , 43 day , the President met 291 national councilors of the U.S.O. , told them how important their work is even in peacetime , and welcomed one of them , retired Admiral John Leslie Hall Jr . ( who commanded amphibious landings under General Eisenhower during World War II ) as " the old Viking admiral . " On another day the President entertained Ireland 's John A. ( for Aloysius ) Costello , who identified himself as a " very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and presented his host with a silver bowl full of shamrocks ; in return , he received a framed picture of Ike . <P> With Mrs. Eisenhower the President went out one night to the opening of the movie Richard III . He found Producer-Director-Star Laurence Olivier worried that he might not enjoy the show , which was taking up some three hours of his leisure . " If it displeases you , " said Olivier , " I will be outraged with myself . " The President was not displeased . Even if he had been , this first trip to a theater since his heart attack was more than an evening out : the affair was a benefit for the Washington Heart Association . <P> The President kept in touch with the problems as well as with the people . He met with Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson and Admiral Arthur Radford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and later with the full J.C.S. , to hear reports on the Puerto Rico conference on defense planning . Slipping out of the White House one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business Advisory Board , and listened to a briefing on North Atlantic Treaty Organization problems by his old friend and aide , General Alfred Gruenther . Ike added a new meeting to his schedule : for the first time he attended a session of the " sub-cabinet , " made up of the deputies and assistants to Cabinet members . <P>
