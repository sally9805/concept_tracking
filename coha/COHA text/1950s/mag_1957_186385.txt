By the smoky orange light of flaming tar barrels , voters in County Clare sang and danced at the crossroads one night last week . They were celebrating the return to power , in Ireland 's first general elections since 1954 , of their own 74-year-old Eamon de Valera , whose Fianna Fail ( Men of Destiny ) Party scored a clear-cut victory by taking 78 of the Irish Dail 's 147 seats . <P> The venerable Dev is half-blind and not the man he used to be , but he is still Ireland 's best-known politician . He was a world figure when Dwight Eisenhower was an unknown Army major , served as president of the League of Nations when Richard Nixon was an undergraduate at Whittier College . Dev , who has been Prime Minister of his fledgling republic for a total of 19 years , is the only surviving commandant of the legendary Easter Rebellion of 1916 . In those feverish days he was saved from execution only by British fears of U.S. reaction ( Dev was born in New York ) . <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elections were almost without issue . De Valera campaigned almost exclusively on the grounds that the coalition government of John A. Costello was too weak to govern effectively . The real question seemed to be whether any government can cure Ireland 's ills . <P> Ireland 's living standard has never been high ; its young , overprotected industries do not begin to supply its needs for manufactured goods . During the past two years the country has been struggling with an increasingly serious balance-of-payments crisis . John Costello met this courageously by slashing imports drastically , but meantime unemployment rose to 90,000 ( out of a population of 3,000,000 ) , and construction slumped . And every year some 30,000 to 40.000 Irish of working age are emigrating , mostly to Britain , where the average wage is 50% higher than in Ireland . <P> Both Costello and De Valera are too good patriots to make a campaign issue of the flaming question of partition , emphasized in recent months by a sharp increase in border raids by the outlawed Irish Republican Army . Though campaign speeches by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice of dividing Northern and Southern Ireland , both the speakers and their listeners knew that none of the old men who lead Irish politics today , nor even men much younger than they , were likely to live to see partition 's end . The Sinn Fein ( We Ourselves ) Party , the political front for the I.R.A .. won only four seats . When De Valera heard that the Sinn Fein members would as usual refuse to take their seats , he said simply : " These men are living in the past . . . "
