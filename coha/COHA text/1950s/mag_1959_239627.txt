A man 's search for a faith can be long and arduous , and it can end in unusual vocations , unusual affiliations . Last week Eric Mellor . 28. sometime British soldier , became a full-fledged member of a faith that , beyond its name and warrior tradition , is little known in the West . <P> A London boy whose parents were killed in the Blitz when he was ten . Eric had spent his years in the British army and in a variety of civilian jobs , exploring the paths man has made to God . First he tried the Salvation Army but left after two years , " because they were always criticizing and condemning people who did n't follow their own views . " He became a Roman Catholic , joined the Third Order of St. Dominic and had notions of becoming a priest , but he gave that up because of his disgust at what he termed " commercialism . " He studied the Baptists , the Anglicans , the Methodists , the Hindus , the Buddhists , and pondered them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through Pakistan . Burma , Thailand and Malaya . By the time he reached Singapore , Eric Mellor had decided to become a Sikh . <P> Every Man a Lion . Like Eric Mellor . Nanak , the founder of the Sikhs , who died in 1539 , was troubled about religion . From boyhood , in a village near Lahore , he disputed with both Hindus and Moslems . He took to wandering and meditating until at last he arrived at his own synthesis of the two . Among the peasants of the Punjab he had many followers ; they were called shish ( Sanskrit for disciples ) - eventually corrupted to Sikh . <P> Under the nine great gurus ( teachers ) who followed Nanak , the Sikhs developed into a monotheistic , militant sect , the symbol of whose God is steel . Each Sikh wears a steel bracelet on his right wrist and carries a sword , lets his hair and beard grow , carries a small comb under his turban and wears short trousers . Sikhs are not supposed to smoke , drink alcohol , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no sexual intercourse with Moslems . All Sikhs bear the same last name : Singh , which means " lion . " and the British lion made crack troops of these tough , turbaned fighting men in the days when India was under the British raj . Like the Hindus , the Sikhs believe in karma-the influence of present actions on future lives-but without the resigned passivity so often associated with Hinduism . Like the Moslems , they revere a sacred scripture , the Granth Sahib , which is displayed under a canopy in all Sikh temples . Worshipers approach it barefoot , their heads covered ; young people receive baptism ( pahul ) in front of it . wedding couples walk around it four times , the dying have it read aloud , and when they are cremated , hymns from the Granth are chanted as the flames rise . <P> Five Sikhs &; God . Important decisions are reached by majority vote-a resolution passed by the elected representatives of the Sikh community can even rescind the rules laid down by the revered gurus themselves . As one saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one <P> Sikh . Where there are two Sikhs , there is an <P> assembly of saints . Where there are five Sikhs , there is God .
