Canadian defense strategy took a historic turn last week . The old concept meant preparedness for overseas wars ; the new emphasizes air power and radar screens for home defense . In Canada 's new $1,775,000,000 defense budget , the biggest share ( 42 of every $1 ) was assigned to the Royal Canadian Air Force . Part of the appropriation will be spent to build and man more Canada-U.S. radar stations in the Far North . One radar network , the Pinetree Chain , is already in operation , and two more are being built this year . The balance of the air force 's budget will be used to make the R.C.A.F. the nation 's biggest service , with 41 squadrons ( 2,845 planes ) and a regular strength of 51,000 v. 49,000 in the army , 20,000 in the navy .
