London 's impertinent music halls lampoon Joe McCarthy , Noel Coward or anybody else ( except royalty ) who crosses the news . But last week a songwriter got too saucy with Anthony Eden and ran afoul of the Lord Chamberlain , who has power to grant or refuse theatrical licenses without explanation . Three days before the opening of an obscure new revue called Light Fantastic , the Lord Chamberlain ordered the offending song lyrics dropped . The net result : London 's tabloid Daily Mirror , which needs no by-your-leave from the Lord Chamberlain or anyone else , printed the ditty : <P> My profile once caused a feminine flutter And then , even better than that , I was named by the " Tailor and Cutter " And they borrowed my name for a hat . <P> But I 'm a sort of permanent fixture No power and not much glory . America 's favourite whipping boy , Just an ordinary Front Page Tory . <P> <P> The Old Man 's a genius-none would dispute- Though at times he 's a bit of a tartar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's second to none , <P> Painter-and builder-brilliant as any , But I feel I could lay bricks almost as well , And perhaps without dropping so many . <P> But here I am stuck in the same old rut Going my usual way A traveling life And you ca n't take the wife And not even a rise in pay . <P> Thirty odd years of frustrated desire Waiting for senior men to retire . Assistant , adviser , consultant and guide . Always the bridesmaid-Never the Bride !
