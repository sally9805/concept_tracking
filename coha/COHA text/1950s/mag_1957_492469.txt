were mating , nesting . In the aspens and water elms along the stream the redstarts and Blackbalmier 's were flashing around like jewels in the tree-top sun . I was a few hundred yards upereek from our cabin , and alone , Fred and Roy had taken the boat and gone pickereling at the lower end of the lake . I knew positively that the creature across the stream was n't a man . Or a bear . In that patchy undergrowth , mostly witch hazel and spicebush , the man or bear never lived that could move around without my seeing it . I had the " thing " figured as being about bobcat size . But it was n't acting like a cat . In fact , it was n't acting like any animal I 'd ever done business with . As it slipped from thicket to thicket , paralleling me , I could tell roughly where it was by the " snake calls " of warbler and vireo , the occasional scolding of a chipmunk , and especially by the tiny bugle calls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered pines across the stream there was evidently quite a community of these thimble-sized animals , for every now and then I heard the shrill , high-pitched trumpeting of one of the fiery little insectivores as it hurled its defiant war cry at the intruder , several hundred times bigger than itself . At first I had merely felt curious about that puzzling creature . Then I felt challenged  --  it was making my woodcraft look bad . Finally I got exasperated , tossed my fishing gear onto a mossy rock and muttered , " Looky , thing . You and I are going to have a showdown . I 'll fin.d out what you are if I have to chase you halfway across two counties . " At the nearest riffle 1 crossed the stream and swung out through the woods toward an open , burned-over hillside . I went slowly , carefully , stopping every rod or so to glance around and listen . My idea was to maneuver the creature out against that open burn-over and so get a look at it . But it outfoxed me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it shadowed me all the way to the foot of the hill slope , as silent and unseen as a ghost of the bush . Hoping to draw it out to the woods edge , I angled casually up the hillside a few rods , leaned against a boulder and watched below . In a minute the creature eased out to the first trees and into a small thicket of laurel . Even then I could n't see it at first . I merely saw a towhee flush from those laurels and a pine squirrel skitter up a birch there . Not till I slowly lifted my field glasses and drew the thicket up close could I make the creature out . One reason for its being so hard to spot was its camouflaging color  --  a sort of lichen gray shaded with darkish . But the big reason was its peculiar camouflaging motion . Instead of standing rigid and statuelike , betraying itself by a telltale animal outline , it kept swaying its head and shoulders very slightly , sinuously . Foxes watching you have this same deceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In the Eskimo grass and dwarf willows of the Barren Grounds you can look right at a wolf and never see it . About the size and build of a lean , thirty-five-pound dog , the creature in the 1.37 laurels was a trim , attractive animal , coyotelike , but with blunter ears , shorter fur and sturdier forelegs than a coyote . Its generous forehead bulge and medium-slender muzzle , along with its intelligent , steady-gazing eyes , made up an exceptionally handsome canine head . In color it was somewhere around a coyote-tawny , with a wash of blackish down its back and tail , but those legs , ears and other features proved it had dog blood in its veins. f was looking at a coydog , a genuine coydog  --  America 's newest animal and also its wildest . 138 81mt. me down , l thought , hardly believing my luck . For a coydog is almost incredibly wild and wary and human-shy . Game wardens wilt tell you that they 've had the animals in their territory for years without ever seeing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live back in lonely , rugged country and avoid man like the proverbial plague , And here , now , one of those wild things had been sticking to me like a bur for half an hour and was standing down there within easy stone 's throw . Them had to be some reason for this , and I tried to figure what . The coydog 's manner seemed to indicate great anxiety . It wanted to be miles away from me , but something was holding it there , as though by an invisible tether . Remembering somewhat similar experiences with foxes and wolves , I had a hunch what the situation was here . But I did n't follow up my guess just then because I was too busy studying this stranger of the upland wilds . Among hunters and sportsmen all over the States and Canada , just mentioning the coydog  --  or dogote , brush wolf , silver wolf , hill dog  --  stirs up an argument quicker than kicking into a nest of bumblebees . Starting with the name itself . the boys disagree on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a thirty-pound animal , the next that it 's sixty pounds . They kill deer and they do n't kill deer . They 're thick as hops and scarcer than hen 's teeth . You even find people who insist there is n't any such animal at all ; it 's coyotes , plain and simple , Others are just as positive they are merely some dogs that have gone sx ild and taken to the hills . Like the blind men who went to see the elephant , any one of these opinions may be right , for one particular locality . With vast understatement one authority on the canine tribe calls the situation " a confused picture . " The reason for this confusion lies in a recent spectacular development in the life and ways of the key animal . the coyote . Originally the coyote 's home was the West and Southwest . With a few exceptions , it was kept out of the South , North and forested East by the wolf . A smallish animal , seldom topping forty pounds , it occupied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of things . Even in its homeland it was never very abundant . The tales to the contrary probably arose from the fact that one coyote under the desert moon can make like a dozen or so . A couple of generations ago the coyote began to increase noticeably in numbers and spread into new territory , with almost explosive swiftness as such things go . It spread across the South . It appeared in the Midwest and followed the forest belts on east to the Middle Atlantic and New England states . Its most striking migration , though , was up along the Northern Rockies to the Yukon and Mackenzie countries and even to the Arctic Coast . These northern coyotes are a great deal larger than the parent stock , as with most animals that go north . On the Liard River in the subarctic I saw specimens of coyotes that nudged seventy pounds . The reason for the sudden appearance of the coyote in places where it was never seen before is simple  --  the elimination of the wolf . Big gray boy can easily overhaul little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can whip half a dozen coyotes before breakfast . Where you find wolves in effective numbers , you do n't find many coyotes . In some regions , especially the North , the so-called " brush wolves " are pureblooded coyotes . In a few places we find pockets of " feral " dogs  --  animals which heard the call of the wild , severed their connection with man and established themselves in out-of-the-way spots , I kept tab one winter on a pack of feral dogs a couple of generations wild , within fifty miles of New York City . Then they took to raiding poultry farms and were hunted down and shot . in many regions , especially in the East , the majority of " brush wolves " are a mixture of dog and coyote . The coyote immigrants into the East were few and scattered , and mates were scarce , and this was probably the main reason they interbred with dogs . In suitable territory this mixed stock is now rooted pretty solidly , though it is nowhere plentiful . The coy-dog , you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farms . Keeping back in the wildest hills it can find , it has that last , supreme intelligence of all  --  to have no trade or truck with man . The strange tactics of my coydog yonder in the laurels made me pretty certain it had a mate , den and cubs nearby and was trying to protect them by " crossing my nose " and luring me off . That den , I figured , was probably somewhere on that open hillside , where the cubs would have the wholesome sunshine to bask in and a wallow of dry dirt to keep down ticks and fleas . All members of the dog family , including foxes , will choose such a whelping location if they can . To test out my guess , i angled a little farther up the slope . As I did this , the coydog came out of the brush into plain sight , to get my attention and draw me away . When I made as though I did n't see it and walked on , it lifted its muzzle and voiced a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I still walked on , it made a swing up in my direction , came within twenty steps of where I was standing , then circled back down to the brush and stood there keening . I noticed that the animal was a female , and things looked to me as though she was just weaning off a litter of cubs . For so wild and shy a creature , that little dash into the open and so close to me was quite a piece of courage . l looked all around for her consort , wondering where he was . Almost always the male fox or wolf will come out first to meet you and cross your nose . But I could n't see hide or hair of the male , and the question of his whereabouts did n't seem important just then . Standing on a boulder , I searched the hillside with my glasses to locate the coy-dog den . Except for sparse grass and weeds , the gully-cut slope was bare and was only about a dozen acres in area , but I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem important at the moment . l did want to examine that den to see what the coydogs were feeding on , and also wanted to observe those cubs and study their behavior  --  always an index to the nature of the adult animal . But my presence there was frying the nerves of the female coydog  --  Lady , I later named her  --  so I did n't hang around long . After a few minutes , I headed down through the woods and across the creek , retrieved my fishing gear and ambled back to camp . At our noon mug-up at the cabin I heard a piece of news , more or less just chance gossip , that jarred on me . Fred and Roy had got it from a pair of fishermen they 'd met at the lower end of the lake . 139 Over in our neck of the woods , Fred said , there 'd lately been a couple of " brush wolves " howling around at night . The people at the little resort village over on the main drag had got skittish about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ordered its nearest field man to attend to the matter . The man had come over here , Fred said , and had succeeded in shooting one of the animals . It was a male and had tried to cross his nose , so he knew there was a female and cubs around close . So he was coming back tomorrow morning to hunt up the den and kill the rest of the coydogs . Now l knew why Lady was alone up there , doing her lone-handed best to carry on . I pictured her consort trying to lure the Conservation man away , as Lady had done with me , and I conceived a dislike for the man . It was understandable that ordinary people , not knowing about the human-shy nature of the coy-dog , should want the animals eliminated , but he was a wildlife expert and I fell he should be defending that family of harmless coydogs instead of shooting and cyaniding them . That afternoon we went spinning for calicoes in a lake cove where the water had warmed up , and I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Fred and Roy . The calicoes were whopping big ones , running to two pounds and over , but to tell the truth I was n't studying fish . I was thinking that tomorrow that Conservation so-and-so was coming back to kill Lady and those cubs , and I was trying to figure some way of circumventing him without getting myself and two partners into trouble . The scheme I finally thought out called for me , as a first step , to locate that den exactly . So when trouting time came , late that afternoon , I let Fred and Roy go off by themselves while I hit back through the woods on the south side of the creek and climbed a rocky , timbered slope that looked straight across the little valley at the burned-over hillside . Taking care that the sharp-eyed Lady would n't spot me , I slipped into a nest of squat junipers on the lip of a small cliff and turned my glasses at that burn-over . The early-evening sun , lying slant and golden over the lake and woods , was bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the open space . There were plenty of burrows on it , with fresh dirt at their mouths , but they were groundhog burrows mostly . When chucks clean their dens out in the spring , they sort of bulldoze the dirt out , between their chest and forelegs , making a little mound at the entrance , whereas all members of the dog tribe kick the dirt out with their feet , making a fan-shaped apron of fresh soil . From my good angle I soon spotted the den , near the upper edge of the hilhide . Besides the telltale apron , the hole itself was much too large for groundhog work . The cubs were not outside , but I knew they 'd be out before long . After going all day with little or nothing to eat , they would be half famished and would n't wait for full dark . Just inside the upper woods , Lady was standing guard on a rock . She had n't seen me and could n't wind me , but somehow she seemed suspicious that I was over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . But she kept searching that hilt slope where I was and monitoring the air in that direction , as though sensing that she was being spied on . About the time the towhees were sounding their first evening " spinkspink " and the whitethroats were lifting their flutelike " oh-mieur , " I saw two small , fuzzy heads with black noses and black , shoe-button eyes appear at the mouth of the burrow . After warily making sure the coast was clear . the two cubscame on out , followed by three others . A bit larger than half-grown rabbits , they were mighty cute little rascals . Two of them were a light silver in color , but one was very darkish , and a couple of them showed a tendency toward being lop-eared , a dog-heritage trait . After a spell of yawning and stretching , they began playing . fighting , scratching fleas , nibbling at green stuff , but mostly watching around expectantly , as though wishing that their parent would hurry up and bring on something to eat . For their age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubs . A buzzard passing overhead , a train whistle three miles away , the distant putt-putt of my partners ' small kicker , would send them zipping back into the den . On their ten-yard expeditions away from the burrow they kept close together and were markedly social in their actions  --  a pack already , not a collection of individuals . In great contrast to the vicious , punishing battles which fox cubs stage incessantly and which are an index to the unsocial , solitary nature of the adult fox , the little spit fights of the coydog cubs were brief and easygoing . As I studied the cubs , I wished that the people over yonder on the main drag could watch those half-pint coydogs for a few minutes with me and could see how pitifully human-shy Lady was . Then they would n't sit in their safe homes o ' nights and shiver around when they heard the " brush wolves " howling . Any pennyfeist in their village was more of a " dangerous animal " than the coydogs they wanted killed off . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coydog with destroying deer , raiding livestock and other crimes and misdemeanors , for which you can find no hard-fact evidence anywhere . A human wrongfully charged can answer back . A wildcreature ca n't . Voiceless and defenseless , it has to take the consequences , and sometimes these can be unjust and cruel  --  as with this coydog family . A little after sunset , Lady jumped down from her sentry rock and disappeared in the woods . In less time than seemed possible she came trotting back with a woodchuck , and you should have seen the welcome she got . It was n't altogether on account of the groceries . The joy and reassurance that cub animals show when a parent returns to the den is one of the most appealing little dramas outdoors . It was whippoorwill dusk when I got back to the cabin . Stopping only long enough to freshen up my fly dope and get a flashlight and a bandanna kerchief I 'd carried yesterday , I crossed the creek and headed back through the woods toward the burned slope . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , the screech owls were beginning their tremolos , and as I passed through the scatter of pines I heard one of the strange and eerie outdoor sounds  --  the twilight chorus of the pygmy shrews . For some reason these tiny animals , smallest of all the mammals , emerge from their tunnel homes at a certain evening moment and sound their high-pitched trill in unison . It is the same two-toned note that a caged pygmy shrew emits when you badger him experimentally with a twig , but when you hear it in a darkening woods from a hundred of them , this vesper song of the Pygmy shrew has a primitive and melancholy quality impossible to describe . At the lower side of the burn-over , Lady met me in the woods , her burning eyes like greenish coals in the beam of my flash . Her efforts that morning to keep me away from her bairns were as nothingcompared to the show she put on now , in the mantling dusk . She kept circling me at forty or fifty feet , often dashing in closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snarls , Under similar circumstances a vixen fox has a bigger repertoire of scary sounds , but Lady 's was good enough to send chills up and down your backbone if you did n't know that she was the scared one  --  scared for herself and her young . When I reached the den I approached silently , stooped down , listened at the mouth of the burrow , and heard the mewing and puppylike growls of the cubs . The instant my scent drifted back in to them , they shut up . Lady , too , I noticed , had quieted off . When I looked around , I saw her a few rods out in the dark , watching me with those burning eyes , and whining . Her keening sounded as though she had given up . As though she had done her best and it had n't been enough , and now she could only sit and watch the destruction of her home and bairns . I played the light around the den and saw that the main food item there was woodchucks . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meadow mice and some ordinary shrews . These last the cubs had n't touched , probably because of the strong musky odor . By the time I finished my errand at the den the dark was settling down , a few major stars were out and the night silence was falling over the hills . Far away back in the main range , so far it was a mere pinpoint of sound , I heard a coydog lifting its cadence from some high peak line , To me it was a very pleasing and reassuring note  --  the wilderness has not yet entirely vanished , but in some places is even making a comeback . Early the next morning a boat came putt-putting across the lake , and it was the Conservation man  --  Fraser , we 'll call him  --  with a rifle , glasses and some cyanide smoke cartridges . We were just finishing hreakfast and he sat in with us for a cup of coffee . A lean , leathery-faced man of forty , with a dry New England way of talking , he was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regretted jumping to the conclusion that he was a so-and-so . For it was plain that he did n't like the job he was on . Orders were orders and taxpayers were taxpayers , but he did n't like it . When I told him 1 had seen those cubs on the burn-over slope and could save him the trouble of hunting up that den , he thanked me somewhat less than warmly . I could see he was thinking that l was a pretty poor specimen for wanting to help destroy those little things . We got to talking about coydogs , and he said there were quite a few of them farther back in the hills . Maybe fifty , maybe a hundred ; it was hard to tell . They preyed considerably on snowshoe rabbits , but so far he had not seen an instance of their preying on deer . People would see coydog tracks around deer carcasses , he said and swear that the coy-dogs had killed those animals , whereas examination showed that the deer had perished from sickness , ovcrbrowsed range or general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it would be a good thing if these coydogs did do some preying on deer . We 'd have a better herd , better hunting . " He was stating a truth which is often overlooked by people who are n't experts about such matters . The curse of any deer herd that is free from natural predators and protected by game laws is the inevitable increase of animals that are small , weak , sickly or otherwise undesirable . In time  --  and it does n't take many years  --  such a herd degenerates in vigor , size of animal , finally in size of the herd itself . Natural predators , in reasonable numbers , comb out this undesirable breeding stock and keep the herd toned up and healthy . We finished the coffee and Fraser and I set out . There was no four-legged phan torn in the woods that morning , and no Lady meeting us at the burn-over , and I knew my scheme had worked . When we got up to the burrow , there were no fresh signs on the apron of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spider had spun its sheet web during the night . Soon after I had plastered that place up with man scent and left , Lady had gathered her cubs around her and headed for a safer home farther back in the hills . To my embarrassment , I noticed that when I 'd brushed my tracks shut last evening I had missed a couple of heel prints and had left a couple of other signs besides , and I felt sure that a cagey woodsman like Fraser would see them . If he did , he did n't say anything . As he stood there looking all around for several minutes and studying things , he glanced at me queerly once or twice , and I had the feeling that he was piecing together the story of my visit there  --  the when and the why of it . But still he did n't say anything , and for all I knew he was preparing to conduct me to the pokey for interfering with a Conservation officer 's duties . Apparently he did n't even notice that the coydog home had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the den , all right . No question. - He got out a couple of the deadly cartridges , rolled them down into the burrow and sealed up the entrance with rocks and soil . Then he took out his notebook and jotted down an entry about his trip , for his official re-port : " Located coydog den . Cyanided same . " As we were going down the slope , he remarked , in his dry way , " Those coy-dogs up yon must have killed somebody and cat him . All but his bandanna handkerchief . l found his bandanna in the loose dirt at the mouth of that place . " I was n't sure how to play it , so I kept quiet . He stopped and offered me a cigarette , and then I saw that his eyes were friendly , in a dead-pan face . " Well , anyhow , " he said , " they wo n't be howling around here at night any more . Thanks for helping me get rid of ' cm . " " Do n't mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
