Sticky monsoon rains pelted the little band of marchers as they sloshed up the mud-laden roads toward the border of Goa . The long-heralded invasion was on . In the lush , Rhode Island-sized Portuguese colony on the west coast of India , 4,000 African troops and 1,000 Goan police waited , guns loaded and aimed . In far-off Lisbon , frantic crowds prayed in churches and demonstrated in the streets against the coming onslaught on Portugal 's ancient colony . <P> As the group of invaders from India-19 Goans carrying nothing but umbrellas and little cloth bags , and led by a 26-year-old man trained for the priesthood-made their determined way along the road , Indian policemen saluted the Indian tricolored flag which they carried , for the day was India 's Independence Day . Finally the marchers reached a sagging chain across their path . Behind the chain stood seven Goan policemen and a small dog . Undaunted , the little band stepped over the chain and tramped into Goa . <P> The Goan cops locked up their guardhouse , slung their rifles on their shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soaked to the skin , the strange procession walked on through the deserted countryside ( the Portuguese had evacuated people from villages near the border , to prevent demonstrations ) . The weary cops were lagging behind when suddenly the marchers dived off the road into the thick jungle . Baffled , the cops argued among themselves , and decided not to give chase . <P> A few miles north , two other groups of peaceful invaders , one with 20 marchers , another with ten , all Goans , walked calmly into the little colony . Back at his headquarters in the Indian town of Karwar , 46-year-old Peter Alvares. president of the National Congress of Goa and mastermind of the unarmed invasion to " liberate " the colony , insisted that all this was according to plan : he had instructed his liberators to scatter among the people of Goa and preach freedom until captured . <P> Several hundred miles away , at the border of Portugal 's colony of Daman , 1,000 Indian nationalists gathered . But Indian Frontier Security Police barred their way : Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement for freedom . Perhaps Nehru had heard that Communists had infiltrated this crowd of Indian nationalists , hoping to set themselves up as rulers of Daman . <P> By the end of the day , Portugal 's flag still flew over Goa . Earlier in the week Nehru had announced : " The Indian Army could take Goa in a trice if it wanted to . but we do not want to . " Apparently , having heard from the rest of the world , Nehru decided that now was the wrong moment for swallowing up Goa.
