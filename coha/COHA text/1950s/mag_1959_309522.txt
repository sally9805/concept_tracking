Summertime and the livin ' is easy <P> Fish are jumpin ' , and the cotton is high . <P> <P> The record industry , which is not finding the livin ' in the singles market easy , hopes to ease some of its pain this summer with massive LP infusions of George Gershwin , massively publicized by a full throated chorus of movie and record company pressagents . With Samuel Goldwyn 's Porgy and Bess about to be released , the record makers have pressed nearly 30 Porgy albums , ranging in style from Overstuffed Country Club to Tubular Cool . Columbia has issued excerpts from the sound track with Cab Calloway dubbed in as Sportin ' Life in place of Sammy Davis Jr. , who sings the role in the movie. * The sampling is generous , and the sound is refulgent , but most of the performances lack a properly dramatic cutting edge . Notable exceptions : Calloway and Baritone Robert McFerrin , who sings Porgy for Actor Sidney Poitier . <P> Listeners curious to hear how Sammy Davis might have sounded if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of excerpts , with Davis assisted by Carmen McRae . Both singers have a taste for vibrato , gratuitous grunts and wailing crescendos that achieve the remarkable effect of smearing some of the most singable lines ever written . On a United Artists album , Diahann Carroll , who appears as Clara in the movie , gets a chance to sing her own part and a number of other songs with the Andr Previn Trio ( Previn was musical director of the film ) . Singer Carroll 's personal Catfish Row apparently runs east from the Waldorf-Astoria 's Empire Room , but at her best-in Oh , I Ca n't Sit Down and It Ai n't Necessarily So-she gives the familiar lyrics a delightfully carbonated tingle all her own . Previn and his men swing behind her as discreetly as a trio of hula dancers skating on thin ice . <P> All Jazz . Harry Belafonte and Lena Home seem to be naturals for Porgy , if not for Sam Goldwyn , and their failure to do better on RCA Victor 's album is chiefly due to their efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong , on the other hand , tilt into the lyrics on a new two-LP Verve album with an infectious grace as easy as a ramble through the high cotton . The combination of Armstrong 's gravel throat and Ella 's honey-clear voice in Bess , You Is My Woman Now makes for the finest reading of the song on records . <P> Among no-words , all-jazz editions , Guitarist Mundell Lowe and a seven-man group are effective in a Camden album that has the musicians swinging in long , limber lines of nicely muted sound . The most imaginative Porgy is supplied by Trumpeter Miles Davis on a Columbia LP arranged by Gil Evans ; in this case the Gershwin themes serve only as a departure point , usually for attenuated Davis solo nights .
