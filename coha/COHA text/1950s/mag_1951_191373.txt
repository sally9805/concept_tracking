Until World War II , most Americans thought that rockets were useful only for Fourth of July celebrations and trips to the moon . But not Dr. Theodore von Krmn , the cigar-smoking , eager boss of the famed Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at CalTech . With Air Force and private funds , Dr. von Krmn had been experimenting enough with rockets to know they could be an important weapon . And since he was well acquainted with the work of the top Axis aerodynamicists , he knew what fast progress they were making with rockets . But when Dr. von Krmn tried to get U.S. corporations interested in going into the rocket business in 1941 , he was turned down flat . So Scientist von Krmn decided to make them himself . <P> The next year , with four associates , an $8,700 investment , and five employees , he set up the Aerojet Engineering Corp . of Azusa , Calif . Its product : Jato units , 10-in. thick , 3-ft. long rockets to give big planes an extra push to get them off short runways or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy and Air Force began firing orders at Aerojet and the company took off with a whoosh itself . Within 18 months , it got six Government loans to expand , still needed more cash . It got it from General Tire &; Rubber Co. ( which liked Aerojet so much that it now owns 81% of its stock ) . <P> $185 a Bottle . During the war , Aerojet turned out some $10 million worth of Jato units , became one of the biggest U.S. rocket manufacturers . As Aerojet began to rise , Von Krmn stepped down from the presidency , became the company 's chief research consultant . CalTech 's imaginative physicist Dr. Fritz Zwicky became active , research chief . <P> War 's end put Aerojet into a brief downward glide . Commercial airlines shied away from Jato because of the cost ( the $185 bottle can only be used once ) and the fact that the take-off roar scared spectators . But military orders sent Aerojet soaring again-jet planes such as the B-47 use 18 Jato units for a quick takeoff . <P> Rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backlog bulging its pocket , Aerojet announced that its $10 million plant at Azusa ( almost completely paid for ) was not big enough . It bought 7,200 acres 16 miles east of Sacramento to build a new $6,000,000 plant . Much of Aerojet 's experimental work is secret but , among other things , it is working on 1 ) rocket units for underwater propulsion , 2 ) rocket-propelled missiles , and 3 ) a rocket-powered oil drill . <P> Bright , 33-year-old General Manager William Zisch thought that Aerojet would now climb faster than ever . Said he : " We go into this emergency with more than 1,600 highly skilled personnel . We went into the last emergency with only five . As for our growth from here-well , five is to 1,600 as 1,600 is to X. You figure it out . "
