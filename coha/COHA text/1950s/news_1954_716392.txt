txt A back-to-work vote at Paducah , Ky. , ended the Government 's atomic strike crisis tonight , for the time being at least . The vote was reported as 329 to 96 . ' About 1,000 workers were involved in the strike there , but all did not vote . The Paducah workers reversed the position . they had taken early this morning . Their 3,502 fellow union members  --  and strikers at Oak Ridge , Tenn. , went back to work today . The Oak Ridge workers had voted early this morning to end the strike that started Wednesday . The plants in the meantime have been manned by supervisory personnel and other nonunion workers . The Administration suspended its preparations to seek a strike ending injunction in the Federal courts after the Paducah vote . The basis of the return to work was a statement by James P. Mitchell , Secretary of Labor , to officers of the Gas , Coke and Chemical Workers Union , C. I. 0. , and to Walter P. Reuther , president of the C. I. 0 . The Atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in two more Oak Ridge plants , also was involved in the dispute but did not strike . James C.

I. 0 . workers have voted to return to their jobs . " The President desires to give special public tribute to those A. F. L. workers at Oak Ridge and supervisory personnel at both locations who recognized the importance of the , national security aspects of their jobs and who did not leave them . " He is also gratified that the C. L 0 . members returned volunContinued tarily to work and that the plants will soon be restored to normal operation .

The stateifient mentioned housing , health , and community facilities and other problems , but did not refer to wages , as such . The strike issue was wages , the union having rejected the Atomic Energy Labor Panel 's recommendation of an increase of six cents an hour . Wage rates range from $1.58 to $2.40 an hour . The union sought a rise of 15 cents an hour . Elwood Swisher , president of the C. I. 0 . union , flew to Oak Ridge after yesterday 's conferences with Mr. Mitchell . He delivered the Secretary 's statement and recommended a return to work . Joseph Joy , vice president of the union , was assigned the same task at Paducah .

This would have compelled the local , union to call off the strike under ' pain of contempt penalties . A board of inquiry established ) by President Eisenhower under the Taft-Hartley Law 's national emergency section submitted a report to him at noon today . This report was a necessary prelimi-1 nary to an application for a restraining order or an injunction . The report was not made public immediately . A restraining order and an injunction have the same effect , but a restraining order may be granted by a judge for a limited period without hearing both sides . Members of the board were Thomas Glennan , president of Case Irr " lute of Technology ; Paul H. Sanders , Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University , and John L. Floberg , a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for The suspension of the strike was a mediation triumph for Secretary Mitchell . He said : " The C. I. O. workers at Oak Ridge have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real understanding of the great importance of their work to the national welfare . The A. F. L. workers who remained at work during this strike situation deserve particular praise for their steadfast action . " The decision of the C. I. 0 . workers at Paducah made late this afternoon to return to work ends the strike . " Secretary Mitchell said that the injunction would have been necessary and the Government would have to use it if the strikers had voted against returning . However , he said , he believed the voluntary method was much to be preferred . ? The first major strike of atomic production workers is expected to lead to a re-examination of the Government 's labor policy in this field . This is all but promised in the statement of Secretary Mitchell , delivered by union leaders to the strikers last night . This statement said : " Arrangements have been made for a conference of union leaders with the Atomic Energy Commission to discuss matters of housing , health , and community facilities and other problems affecting the welfare of workers and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located . " A study will be initiated to seek to improve labor-management relations and to strengthen collective bargaining in the atomic energy field . " The Government has taken the position that these workers are employes of private industry . At the same time they have been told they had no moral right to strike . Classifying these workers as employes of private enterprise is , in a sense , a fiction because the impact of any strike falls primarily on the Government and Government policy . The employer , a private contractor , is simply an agent of the Government and is paid by the Government . The contractor is concerned with the wages he pays his atomic workers , of course , because usually he operates nonatomic plants and his employes there are quick to note any concessions and demand he do the same for them . It is an axiom of labor-management relations that one way to avert strikes is for the employer to demonstrate that he is in a position to " take " a strike and win it . This is a powerful ' deterrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position , as it has , that its installations can not take a strike , it is investing the employes with an extraordinary sense of power and at . the same time telling them it is a kind of power that they must not use under any circumstances . The only escape from this paradox apparently is a reliance on the workers ' patriotism , a fervor that few groups can maintain at constant high level in peacetime . This is further complicated by the question whether the Atomic Energy Commission was right in the first place in contending that atomic production plants can not stand a strike . The strike that began last Wednesday reduced some auxiliary operations , but the continuous process operations were not . interrupted . This is a question of fact that undoubtedly will be raised . when , the re-examination of policy is ! begun . If the premise is correct that ! the Government can not afford a ! strike at an atomic plant , one of the alternatives to be consid- ! ered is to make " e workers ; bona fide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security go with ) Government employment , in re- , turn for which they would yield ! the right to strike . This would not divest them of ' 1 their right to seek redress for ! any grievances .
