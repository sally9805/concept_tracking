Manhattan moviegoers last week were packing a Broadway theater to see something new in moviemaking called Cinerama . The critics enthusiastically called it " thrilling , " " sensational , " " breath-taking , " " spectacular " and a " revolution in motion pictures . " The movie itself , a haphazard series of travelogues called This Is Cinerama , would have excited no one if it had been shown by ordinary projectors on a flat screen . What made audiences sit happily through two hours of the first public sampling of Cinerama was the " three dimensional " sensation to eyes &; ears ( TIME , July 2 , 1951 ) . The illusion jammed the spectators into the front car of a whipping roller coaster , then into a gliding Venetian gondola , then in the nose of a converted bomber as it soared across plains and mountains . <P> Cinerama 's trick is produced by filming its subjects with a three-lens camera ( each lens aimed from a different angle ) . Then the film is projected , by three projectors , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several loudspeakers placed around the theater . Result : an impression of full-dimension sight &; sound . Cinerama 's ability to drag the audience into the picture shows up best in the outdoor scenes that capitalize on vast panoramas , since the idea is to present the same wide-angle view on the screen that the human eye sees normally . <P> One criticism : Cinerama 's camera seems too immobile ; there is little use of the customary drama-heightening tricks used in conventional moviemaking , e.g. , panning , cutting , tilting . <P> But Movie Producer Merian C. Cooper ( Grass , Chang , King Kong ) , who is devoting most of his time to the new process , says that Cinerama can do anything regular movies can do , and do it better . " The basis of drama does n't change at all , but the method of presenting it changes radically , " he says . Instead of moving the camera 's eye , Cooper plans to direct the viewer 's eye to the most dramatic spot . With panning made unnecessary , the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other techniques will have to be developed through experience . <P> Cinerama officials are already planning to shoot feature films . The new medium , they claim , will in time replace most flat-screen movies . While many moviegoers are ready to accept this prediction , some agree with one owl-eyed critic who said , after a bout with Cinerama : " They 're riding a two-wheeler , but they 've never learned to walk .
