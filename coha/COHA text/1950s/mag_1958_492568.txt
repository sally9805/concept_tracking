Unhappy marriages have been our business for more than twenty-six years . I have yet to see one in which only the husband or only the wife needed to change . You notice I do n't say " was to blame . " At the Marriage Council of Philadelphia we are n't a bit interested in who is to blame . Our job is to find out what is to blame , and help change it . A man may seem a brute when his wife tells us why she came in  --  and sometimes , of course , he is a brute  --  but after we find out why he acts the way he does , the problem often looks quite different . We have examined Inure than 10,000 marriage problems since 1952 . In that year a group of Philadelphia physicians and social scientists  --  including the celebrated Karl dc Schweinetz  --  and I met to discuss a serious community need : An agency to help prevent those husband-vs. - wife turmoils whose chief victims arc children . At that time only two such agencies existed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Popenoe , in Los Angeles ; and the other , in New York , under Drs . Hannah and Abraham Stone . I was a doctor 's wife and a laboratory assistant at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , and the junior member of the group . But I was the only wife and mother in the group . It was r suppose , that the rest of the committee should ask me to become their first marriage counselor , but the request came as a shock . I agreed to do the work for a six-month trial , and be trained on the job . After its months I realized I had found a lifetime job . 1 got my master 's degree in social work in I916 and my Ph.D . in 19,507 Today . the one-woman staff of I 5t:1 ? 2 has grown to the present Marriage Council , with a counseling and research staff of seventeen , a board of trustees , supervising committees of medical and legal experts , and an office staff . Since 1950 we have keen a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I am a professor of family study in the Department of Psychiatry . There are now more titan four hundred agencies doing marriage counseling in America . Our 10,000 cases have involved a great many " brutal " husbands . For example , a young wife came to us last September . She had left her husband and taken her three children home to mother because , she said , her husband hit her every time he lost his temper , and he was always losing it . She had gone to the Legal Aid Society for help , and they had seat her to us . One of our ' counselors had four interviews with this young woman , four with her husband , and then one final interview with both of them together . The total fees they paid amounted to 5:15.50 . Yet they left hand in hand , apparently eager to work out their problems together . What happened in those nine hours of talk  --  just talk  --  to change the way that husband and wife felt about each other ? How does marriage counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clara Burd , which happens not to be her real name ; in our files she is listed merely as Mrs. X , case number 8451 B. ( Because of the confidential nature of our relationship with our clients , I shall not use real names in any of the cases I describe . Apart from identifying characteristics , however , the cases are reported just as they occurred . ) Clara phoned in and was given a three-o'clock appointment with Dr. Hilda Goodwin , our supervisor . She might have drawn any one of our eight counselors ; the secretary on duty usually assigns new clients to whoever happens to have convenient free time . Clara arrived on schedule , and was given two forms to fill out . One was a background questionnaire : How much did you share in the housework while growing up ? How much were your parents in agreement or disagreement ? and thirty-seven additional questions about education , religion and early way of life . The other form was a marriage-adjustment schedule : Arc you satisfied with the amount of affection shown ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What are your areas of disagreement ? and some thirty-odd others . We use a third schedule , on sexual adjustment , but it is always filled out by our clients during an interview , and never until they have had time to feel at home with the counselor . When Clara finished the forms , Doctor Goodwin took her to an office on the second floor of the old West Philadelphia double house where we work . The one thing we know about those who walk in our door is that they arc lonely and anxious . Doctor Goodwin , the wife of a broker , has a doctor 's degree in social work . Her most obvious characteristic is gentleness . She closed the door and sat down facing , - Clara . " Now , " she said , " tell me why you are here . " Whether we work with a couple nine hours or forty-nine , there are usually three stages . First we have to find out what each one of them thinks the trouble is . Sometimes they agree on the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . After they have talked enough to give the counselor a good , idea of what is really making them unhappy  --  their first complaint is seldom the real trouble  --  the next step is to help them both sec it . And finally , they have to want to change , not each other , but themselves and their relationship . Clara Ilurd said she was all in pieces . Her husband , Tony . had a terrible temper . Whatever she did , whatever she said , he turned it into an argument and ended up hitting her . Sometimes lie knocked her down . What were the arguments about , Doctor Goodwin asked . Sex ? Money ? No . They got along fine in bed , Clara Burd said . Tony expected her to manage the family finances and she always had . It was all sorts of little things . If something went wrong at work , he came home and took it out on her . If she ever asked him to help with the children or the dishes , he blew his top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , but that was when he most often got mad enough to hit her . If it was n't for his temper  --  well , she liked being married . There were nice times . Sometimes he brought her flowers . Could she get Mr. Burd to come in , Doctor Goodwin asked . Clara said - she thought so ; since she had left him he had called up every day , asking her to come back . A few days later Mr. Burd did come for an interview . He was a little , inconspicuous fellow who drove a milk truck and did n't look much like a brute . He was full of remorse about his terrible temper . He would do anything , promise anything , he said , if we would only get his wife back . Doctor Goodwin explained patiently that we were not here to punish or forgive , and we could n't promise his wife would come back . All we could do was help them find out why theycould n't get along and what they could do about it . This hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? He never meant to . he said , but her whole attitude was , " When I say jump , jump . " Then he 'd get mad . It would all be over in ten or fifteen minutes , and he had n't really hit her often , maybe nine or ten times in the four years they had been married . But Clara and her mother acted as if he was a wife-beater . He 'd never even dried a dish before he got married , and she was always demanding he help with the dishes , help with the children , go shopping with her . His two married sisters laughed at him . His mother-in-law made a lot of the trouble . She seemed to enjoy it when he and Clara had fights . One reason he wanted to make up was he did n't want the children staying with his mother-in-law . That woman had Clara right under her thumb . It was terrible the way his mother-in-law pushed her own husband around . His mother ? Oh , she had died when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters and himself alone . Someone had always been getting a beating . He had sworn when he got married he 'd do things differently , but now look at him . These early family patterns keep cropping up in our work . People may hate the relationship their parents had , but they arc inclined to remember it as the usual way for a husband and wife to act , and tend to act the same way in their own marriage . Clara Burd , it turned out , had learned a completely different , but just as unpleasant , way of life from her own parents . She never meant to make demands on Tony , she said at her next visit . But she was very sensitive , and when he 'd be helpful for a while and then just stop , it hurt her and she could n't help showing it , and then an argument started . It was lonely doing dishes all alone . Mostly she wanted hint to help her for company . What about her mother , who Tony seemed to think made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but long ago Clara had learned that it was easier not to make her mother mad . ( Continued on Page +6 . ) IIIE IIAILIEDAY EVENINO POST So here was a wife who complained that her husband was brutal , and a husband who complained that his wife bossed him around . and both were right , but neither of them had the faintest idea why they hurt each other . Because her ' mailer was so domineering . Clara had probably never in her life heard a woman say , " Wo n't you , please ? " or " I 'd Jove you to , " or even " 1 like you around . " For all her sensitise feelings , the only way she knew how to get what she wanted was to say , " Do this or else ! " Tony Burd had grown up expecting women to do all the housework and seeing a man use the flat of his hand to show he was angry . What 's more , he was sensitive about his puny build , and he had to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wove in and out of their main problem . Clara felt Tony expected her to keep the house too clean , and she tried so hard she was always worn out . Tony was so hostile to his mother-in-law that he continually saw her reflected in his wife . Tony often fell asleep in front of the TV , and that hurt Clara 's feelings . On Sundays , Clara often wanted him to visit her friends , who bored him , while he wanted to go fishing with his father . But there are hundreds of good marriages with this sort of conflict . The basic problem between these two was n't that Tony knocked Clara around , but that each was tearing the other down and living braced awns ' attack . After two painful interviews with Clara , and two with Tony , Doctor Goodwin was able to help each of them begin to understand what made the other flare up so easily . In their marriage they had both looked forward to a gentleness and warmth that neither of them had known in their own families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it to each other  --  instead of demanding it from each other  --  the gap closed up fast . Al their final interview , a joint one , Tony happened to say he wished Clara would have his friends in sometimes . Clara burst into tears and said , " But I do . You 're nut fair . " Tony looked at Doctor Goodwin and said , " See how sensitive she is . She does that all the time . " But then , instead of getting mad himself , he began to comfort her . Of course she did let and said he was right , she did n't consider his wants enough , but she was going to try . The Burds ' life is never going to be a bed of roses . They arc both immature and probably will continue to wish for more than they can hare , but they have learned they need each other , Each has learned to look at his own hurts through the other 's eyes . Here at Marriage Council we have no illusions of turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost refuse to use the word happy in connection with any marriage . Comfortable , loll , satisfying  --  all right . A good marriage has a lot of happiness in it , and fun , and even ecstasy . but life itself is no bed of roses . Why should people think they can fence off marriage and find it sheer bliss ? A huge number of marriages are unhappy just because people have that overly romantic concept . All we try to do is make marriages work , help two people who have grown away from each other come closer together again . We do n't always succeed , by any means . About 5 per cent of all the cases we work with are flat failures  --  that is , the relationship is even worse when the clients leave us than when they came . About 25 per cent show hide or no change , usually because one client or both arc unwilling to change , or just ca n't face the pain involved in trying to change . We have dozens of abortive cases where a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they find they ca n't simply tell their troubles and collect sympathy , or have the counselor wave a fairy wand for them . When they see they wo n't get anywhere unless they themselves actually work at making their life go more smoothly , they do n't come back . But the ones who stick it out and face the painful struggle to understand why they arc hurting each other  --  they go away much happier and much closer together . Our statistical studies show that marriage counseling is a real help to 70 per cent of the couples who stay with us for more than an interview or two . What do we call success ? What do we call failure ? We do not believe any marriage should be mutual enslavement . If we can not help two people understand themselves and each other better , if we can not help them begin to get some satisfaction out of living together  --  or at least work out some solution  --  the counseling has failed . It is a success if they go forward together with a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if two people who can never be happy together learn , through counseling , why and how they have destroyed their marriage . We may have prepared them to do better if they should marry again . The cases we find discouraging are the ones where one or both seem unable to learn anything . Case 7804B in our files is one of these . Phil and Rachel Castor  --  let us call them  --  were assigned to Mrs. Mary Gibbon , a surgeon 's wife , who trained for marriage counseling after her children were grown . Mr. Castor said at once that they had come to see whether they could passably stay married . He did n't think they could . He had been living for almost a year with another woman , Fran , with whom he felt he had much more in common . Fran wanted to marry him , and he thought he wanted to marry her , but he had gone back to Rachel to talk it over and make sure . He and Rachel had had an affair in college . When World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morally committed , but he had always felt trapped . When he went to business school after the war , for instance , he missed all the normal fun of college life . ! lc had often been unfaithful , which hurt Rachel terribly , but each time she forgave him . They had two children , and he felt like a heel , but he did n't think he could ever be happy with Rachel now . Rachel Castor had been in love with Phil since she was eighteen . She had been " determined " to marry him , she told Mrs. Gibbon . She had never toyed anybody else and had decided that his infidelities were the price she had to pay for having a husband so wonderful in every other way . She had never wanted to be unfaithful , but had tried necking around at parties to pay Phil back . He had made a scene and said he would divorce her if she kept it up . Ironically , his reaction made her very happy . It seemed proof that he loved her . Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her husband be more contented . Phil Castor never came back to us . He spent weeks vacillating between Fran and Rachel , who could not bear to make the break herself , and during this time Mrs. Gibbon could do no more than help Rachel face the fact that divorce was the only practical answer . This case was certainly a failure , but a failure can be as educational as a success , and Rachel learned a great deal from it . From some such failures  --  and many more successes  --  we have learned a lot about what works and what does n't work , in the past twenty-six years . Hundreds of individual doctors , ministers , social workers , psychologists and sociologists do marriage counseling today , and quite a few of them had their first training with us . We have had a training program since 1950 , when the Wm . T. Grant Foundation gave us SI00,000 to set up training in this field over a five-year period . As part of the University of Pennsylvania 's School of Medicine , we offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition , a dozen or so professional people each year for special training in ( Continued on Page 48 ) 48 ( Connuued from Page 46 ) marriage counseling . The university pays for our teaching and %4 lie of our fellowships . We have also had research grants Iron both the United States Public Health Service and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Welfare . For mon , our research workers , with Dr. Howard Mitchell as project director , are just now finishing up a study on the relationship between excessive drinking and marital conflict under a state grant . But none of this pays for our counseling . Marriage Council has always been nonprofit , It welcomes any couple needing help , for whatever fee they can afford , regardless of their race or creed . We charge on a sliding scale , according to the clients ' joint income . The average fee is $4.50. but the cost of each interview , allowing for overhead and salaries , is over $10.00 . The difference is made up by individual " member " contributions ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish everyone would . Where do our clients come from ? About 25 per cent arc sent by courts and ' r other public agencies ; many arc sent by members and many more by doctors or lawyers or ministers . The biggest proportion , however , is sent by couples we have counseled . We have many more requests than our eight counselors can handle , We wish we had twice us many counselors , especially when we see the right help turn an apparently hopeless relationship into a happy one . A woman came to us in September of 1954 . I 'll call her Bessie Jacobs . She was an intense , righteous woman with a college degree . I ler husband had had a cornE // plate personality change , she said . He used to be sweet and helpful . Now he was ugly and sometimes downright brutal . She gave a dozen instances . He shot her . He shouted at her and the children . He was drinking secretly . She had found a bottle in his closet . Their life was impossible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come for counseling she just did n't know . She had pleaded with him , but since he would n't listen to her she had simply left him a note . The note , when her husband turned up with it an hour or so later , said : " If you do n't appear you can pack your things and get out . " Mr. Jacobs was a tall , stooped fellow who ran a gas station . He alternated between being exaggeratedly polite and stubbornly withdrawn . He did n't want to be here and said so . His wife had always felt superior because he had only a high-school education . When he did n't get ahead very fast she became more and more critical and demanding . Sometimes when he could n't take any more , he had walked out on her . The last time he had done this she had haled him into court . Oh , they had patched things up  --  but it had n't helped . Maybe he had changed . but he was good and tired of being treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had n't let him near her in years . Even the children had taken to picking on him and making fun of him . Drinking ? Who would n't take a drink , when things were this bad ? One drink and she called lion a drunkard . But what was the point of counseling ? he said . He would just go back to serving , serving , serving until he could n't take it any longer . Amale counselor-in-training worked with these two under my supervision . He saw both the husband and the wife about a dozen times over a seven-month period , twenty-six hours in all , to he exact . They paid 56.00 a visit : the total cost to them was $156 . Mrs. Jacobs spent her first six interviews telling in detail all the ways her husband had disappointed and neglected her , and describing his constant irrational behavior . Once , on a brief vacation at the seashore with some friends , she had written a post card saying it was pleasant to breathe clean fresh air ; he had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month . The counselor listened sympathetically and uncritically week after week . He did n't try to point out the discrepancies between her story and her husband 's , although Mr. Jacobs had shown him the post card that made him walk out . It had been addressed to the Jacobs kids , not to her husband , and what it really said was : " It is good to get away from all the ughness and tension . " The counselor let Mrs. Jacobs talk and find that whatever she said or did she would not be reproached or scorned . Toward the end of the sixth interview she suddenly said , " 1 guess I 've been pretty selfish and arrogant , have n't I ? " A few minutes later she said for the first time , " What can I do ? " For six weeks Mr. Jacobs had been pleading with the counselor to persuade his wife to let him stop coming here . He would promise to do anything , if he could only stay quietly at home . It was quite obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marriage . It took six weeks to make him believe the counselor wanted to help him , not pun- ish him . His ego was beaten down  --  and with reason : Mrs. Jacobs , for instance , had once thrown his week 's earnings in the street in scorn . He had had to get down on his hands and knees to gather it uWri'll'en Mrs. Jacobs said , " What can I do ? " the counselor at last could help April f Y , 19514 her see that she had been using her husband as a scapegoat for her disappoint-Merit at not achieving the glamorous , ! usurious life she dreamed of ; and that , If the children scorned their father , it was because she had torn him down so much in front of them , Mr. Jacobs , meanwhile , began to see that a little quiet liminess was a better way of asserting , himself than getting drunk . It turned out that his drinking had never been anything but a protest against his wife 's not allowing liquor in the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went back to taking walks together . They went back to making love . The children began reflecting their mother 's new attitude and treated their father with new respect and affection . Mrs. Jacobs even began offering her husband a drink in the kitchen before dinner , When they len us they were happily bewildered by the change in their lives . The classic stereotype of the domineering wife and the henpecked husband is one of the commonest conflicts WC run into . Not that the United States is a country of strong women and weak men ; a domineering woman is n't likely to be a strong woman . She does n't know how to get what she wants from her husband or from life by being loving and charming . Some men react to a domineering wife by fighting  --  like Mr. Burd  --  or by alternately submitting and rebelling  --  like Mr. Jacobs . But we see many husbands react in a far more devastating way . If their wives do n't respect them as men , they simply lose their capacity to act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office two years ago asking for a man counselor . He was a shy , rather intense English teacher in a public high school . In our files he is Mr. X , case number 8421 B. Let 's call him George Hollis . He was assigned to Jerry Grossfeld , one of our younger counselors ; Jerry is in his late twenties and has a master 's degree in social work . Mr. Hollis had been married seven years . His wife was a wonderful girl , he said with embarrassment . She used to be a nurse , but had given it up to hare a baby . He was crazy about the baby and loved his wife , but lately , even when he really wanted to make love to her , he could n't . Of course he had been working terribly hard ; and then , too , his wife had been pregnant , but still this impotence was frightening to both of them . They could n't face the idea of divorce . Thcy needed each other , but they could n't go on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychiatrist , but his wife had urged him to come here first . She had heard about Marriage Council from a friend . It was a great effort for Mr. Hollis to talk at all . He sat silently twisting his hat , forced out a halting statement , and then sat silent again . He relaxed a little when Mr , Grossfeld told him theirs was rather a common problem , but tensed up again at the suggestion that he ask his wife to come for an interview , What good would that do ? After all , the problem was with him . Mr. Grossfeld explained that there is a good deal less hope of solving any marriage problem if we can work kVilh only one partner . George Hollis said hopelessly that he 'd tell his wife , but he was n't at all sure she would come . However , Ethel Hollis called up the very next day for an appointment . She turned out to be as friendly and assured as her husband was shy and withdrawn . She had no trouble talking about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brilliant , she told Mr. Grossfeld , but had always been oversensitive and rather helpless except where his work was concerned . For example , she had to cut the grass because he handled the power mower so badly it made her nervous . She had to do all the little repair jobs around the house ; he could never do them right . She realized she should n't but someone had to . She knew she had a tendency to be pretty positive , and sometimes sharp , but she was just that way and it had never 49 made a problem until this recent trouble of George 's . Now , of course , he felt inadequate and she felt hostile because she felt unloved , For a while she had thought there must be another woman , but now she was sure there was n't . If George could just get back to lovemaking . she knew everything would be all right again . We run across plenty of sexual problems , but they are much more likely to be a symptom than a cause . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bring up any other difficulties . But the second ( Confinued on Tinge 55 ) ( Continued from Page 49 ) time Mrs. Hollis came in , she said that her in-laws were very stuffy and conventional and disapproved ofhercomptetely.She did n't like them , either , and she particularly could n't stand her mother-in-law . Being the frank person she was , she could n't help showing it . And George was too closely tied to his parents . How did they disapprove of her ? Well , they thought she was too unconventional and antisocial . She was n't really antisocial , but she had always hated suburban life . Her neighbors were stupid and she could n't be bothered making friends with them . But of course that meant she was alone with the baby all day , so she was often blue when George came home . In his second interview , George Hollis said he had to act as peacemaker between his mother and his wife . " I hate conflict , " he said ; " I always have , but Ethel seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I guess I have what you might call an inferiority complex . I 've never felt I could do anything really well , and now , with this new problem , I just feel more inadequate . " But during most of both interviews he sat silent and hostile , as if he felt the counselor might expose his weaknesses . Jerry Grossfeld concentrated on getting Hollis to talk about his wife and how he really felt about her . By the fifth interview Hollis began to feel it was safe to reveal some of his critical and angry feelings toward Ethel . but though he reported at length on his unsuccessful attempts to make love , he never seemed able to connect those failures with any other feelings about his marriage . Ethel Hollis , meanwhile , spent each hour talking with disarming frankness about her shortcomings , but never as if they were shortcomings . She had given up her job  --  long before she was pregnant it turned out  --  because it made her too nervous , yet she talked as if she had sacrificed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now trapped in a solitary existence . Like Mrs. Jacobs , she was spilling out all her secret resentment . Unlike Mrs. Jacobs , she showed no signs of ever saying " What can I do to change ? " She , too , reported at length on their inadequate sex life , but as if it were walled off from the rest of their life . Mr. Grossfeld began to realize that she was simply using the sessions as one more proof of her husband 's inadequacy . She was saying : " See how co-operative I am . Sec what a hopeless fellow my husband is , " They were n't really getting anywhere , If he could n't get them to face the problem in their relationship squarely and together , counseling was n't ever going to help . Our counselors often have a sandwich lunch together in our conference room and discuss their cases . Jerry Grossfeld told Doctor Goodwin and the other counselors about the Hollises . Something had to happen . Maybe , Doctor Goodwin suggested , George Hollis trusted him enough by now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral support , he 'd tell his wife how he felt . Jerry agreed . The minute the Hoilises came in together , Ethel Hollis started talking . " George has been thinking ? " she began . " Why do n't you let him tell me ? " Mr. Grossfeld said gently . " Well , I 've been thinking that part of our trouble may be ? " George started hesitantly . " You sec , he thinks maybe I ? " Mrs. Hollis broke in again . Mr. Grossfeld said , " Please let him finish . " " But he never can get anything out , " said Mrs. Hollis irritably . " Give him a chance for once . Let him try , " said Mr. Grossfeld and deliberately turned away from her to her husband . " One trouble , " Mr. Hollis started again awkwardly , " is that a man , any man , do n't you think , needs some ego building . She says I have no confidence , but she never helps me get it . She never gives me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I constantly feel I 'm no good because I 'm not living up to her expectations . " " You ca n't blame me for your weaknesses , " Ethel Hollis said defensively , " You 've said often that you felt inferior long before we got married . " George Hollis looked at the counselor and apparently it gave him courage , for he said , " Sure I did , but a man expects his wife to help him change . He expects her to build him up . All you 've ever done was tear me down . When I want to make love to you , I start being afraid because l feel you have nothing but contempt for me . " " Then you do think the impotence may be caused by your other feelings for each other ? " Jerry Grossfeld said quietly . " Yes , I do , " George Hollis said . " How can I make love to her when 1 feel she is sneering at me ? " " But l 'm not , " Ethel Hollis said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individualist , but I ca n't help it if 1 ann . " " Why not ? " Mr. Grossfeld said very gently . " People do change . People can . If your husband feels you tear him down , maybe he 's gut something . Have n't you both been using your unhappy sex life as a shield to hide all your other conflicts ? " There was a good deal more talk , and at the end of the hour Mrs. Hollis went away more silent than she had ever been before . But at her next appointment she stormed into Mr. Grossfeld 's office in a rage  --  not at her husband , at the counselor . " You pretended to understand me , " she accused him , " and then you went and took my husband 's side against mt . " , No , Mr. Grossfeld said , he had simply helped her husband say things she had to hear , but had never been willing to listen to before . Ile had simply helped them both reveal themselves to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so inflexible , said pathetically , " But I ca n't do all the changing . " " You do n't have to , " Mr. Grossfeld told her ; " just some . Your husband is awfully eager to change too , " From then on , things happened quite fast between the Lionises . Ethel Hollis admitted her assertiveness was largely a cover-up for a feeling that she was inadequate and unattractive , She began to work at being gentler and less demanding , while her husband worked at being more communicative and less retreating . As his wife helped him feel more like a man , George Hollis began to feel more like a husband again . As he began to feel closer to his wife he grew far less dependent on his parents , and it turned out that. , like the impotence , the in-law problem had been nothing but a symptom . Ethel Hollis made a deliberate effort to find a neighborhood group they could enjoy together . They realized that each had been starving the other and expecting sex to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of twenty-nine interviews  --  twelve with Mrs. Hollis and seventeen with Mr. Hollis at a total cost to them of S174 ? over a period of five months , those two , though not the all-American marriage , were decidedly a going concern . You may notice that each one of these cases has involved the same thing  --  male pride . Couples bring us dozens of other problems  --  trouble with money , trouble with in-laws , incompatible interests . We help with these problems , but we know the country is full of couples who have the same problems and handle them comfortably because each manages to make the other feel important and loved . The most high-powered and effective men , the most mature men in the world are terribly vulnerable to criticism or scorn from the women they love . But this does n't mean for a minute that wives are responsible for all or even most unhappy marriages . Those three husbands had to do as much changing as their wives did .
