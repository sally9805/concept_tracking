txt Krr Englanders have discovered what Boston 's Museum of Science knew all the time ? " science is fun . " So many people of all ages have found out that the museum 's motto is true that there is only one thing for the institution to do  --  expand , and fast . Details of a 52,500,000 program that is part of a long-range building plan for Science Park were announced today by the director , Bradford Washburn . What is visible now on the eastern end of the Charles River Basin is the completed east wing of the museum . What is scheduled for the next phase of the museum 's development is completion of the tall central building , and finishing the Elihu Thomson Theater of Electricity , already begun . Theater of Electricity When the entire S11,800,000 Science Park is built , a west wing will connect the central building to the Theater of Electricity , which by then will have a Hall of Electricity built around it . On the street side of the the-ater will be located an aquarium . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Berkeley Streets four years ago , X. the unknown quantity , was the degree of popular enthusiasm that could be aroused in natural science . " Public interest in our pro-gram has outstripped our best I hopes , " declares Mr. Washburn . " We must relieve the pressure on our heavily overtaxed east wing just as rapidly as possible . " Simultaneously with the an- its use by children , teachers , hobbyists , and just interested ? citizens called for enlarging the original plan for the towerlike I central building . Ames &; Graves ' of Boston are the architects . The new plan now has been widened and lengthened almost to the water 's edge . The building kill face directly up the river and will be the most prominent feature at the lower end of the Charles River basin . " Our central building here in this model , " Mr. Washburn says , " is not an architectural objective which we have strived to fill up  --  it has been designed around our most vital needs  --  to fill an urgent community requirement for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of New Englanders ! learning about nature and science and enjoying it . " I Last June the museum welcomed its millionth visitor , More important than any building is what goes on inside it . Mr. Washburn insists . In emi barking upon an effort to finance the project , he says : ! " Our objective during the ! next three years is not to raise money for a building . What has brought us all together as a team with a common objective is a wonderful idea . . . We must not sell the museum itself , but what it does and what it will do for generations to come . " On the top or terrace floor of the central building will be the education department with classrooms for teaching courses , hobby and science clubs . Bigger Library The fifth floor will feature the kind of imaginative exhibits fol. which the museum is famous . On the fourth floor will be administration , membership , and news service offices . The library , which today occupies a scant 20 square feet and receives 15,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of the new building . Adjacent to it will be a $165 , - 000 room given by Francis T. Colby in memory of his father , Rear Admiral Harrison Gray Otis Colby . A series of dioramas showing the life zones of the world will complete the third floor . The development of civiliza- tion from the Stone Age to modern times will be pictured on floor two . with the main lobby and entrance situated on the first floor . Of the ** the museum now seeks , George P. Gardner , Jr. , president of the board of trustees , says that $1,750,000 is needed for construction of the central building ; $250,000 for its basic equipment ; $100,000 to finish the electricity theater ; and $400,000 to operate the museum over the next five-year period . Major accomplishments this year cited by the museum include the opening of the new Science Park MTA station , constructed with MTA and MDC funds ; the moving to Science Park of the giant Van de Graaf generator , a gift from MIT : and completion of the field work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles around its peak , to be published jointly by the museum . the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research .
