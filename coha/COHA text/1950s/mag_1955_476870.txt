I FIRST saw Japanese movies because they were forbidden . During the Occupation , the United States Army ? which had taken considerable trouble to teach some of us future military governors the Japanese language ? ruled movies out of bounds . It said we were likely to whistle and stamp during a kiss ? an innovation just being introduced into Japanese movies . The theaters that survived the bombs were miserably cold during the winter of 1946 , with hard seats much too narrow for our bodies . Since the MPs did n't think many of us would sit through four-hour programs of slow , sentimental films , we could ignore the prohibition without much risk , and we took a perverse pleasure in doing so . In that way I discovered glimpses into a strange and visually exciting cinematic art . Back in the United States , I remembered those moments when , beginning in 1951 , a number of beautiful Japanese films were released here , after winning prize upon prize at Venice , Cannes , and Berlin . So recently I went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1946 , most of the movies I saw in Japan were pretty bad . Technical progress had been at a standstill for years , and equipment was in ruins . The industry had a massive inferiority complex toward Hollywood , and stumbled along only because the public thirst for entertainment , as an escape from enforced idleness , boredom , and misery , was insatiable . But even in the worst films 1 found some extraordinary things : exquisite Japanese interiors otherwise hard to see , exceptional camera work , and remarkably emotional and sensitive acting . I still half believed the clich ? about Oriental impassivity , and I wondered mightily about this intense exploration of feelings . True , it often spilled over into sentimentality . The Japanese enjoy weeping so much that in a theater they sometimes sob aloud before anything sad has happened ; they know it will . The mere mention of misfortune or of Mother sets them off , and tear-jerkers called " Haha no Mono " ( " Things About Mother " ) are standard fare . Where else can you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry four times " ? because there are four mothers in a feature film . I must have seen a dozen Japanese films that winter . 1 do n't remember the names of any of them . My Japanese friends would not believe I found anything interesting in them , and pitied me for either my had taste or my affectation . They did take me out to one of the studios once , but more as a lark than to talk seriously . I remember pretty actresses trying to look like Deanna Durbin , their idol then , and directors who somewhere amid the chaos had managed to acquire suede shoes , leather windbreakers , and baseball caps . So I was as surprised as anyone when " Rashomon " won the Venice Film Festival Prize in 1951 . THE Japanese were surprised , too . At that time , the industry was worrying about its slack postwar artistic standards . An inter-company meeting , which had been called to discuss how to improve the morale of directors , cameramen , and actors , was actually considering a proposal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of " Rashomon " arrived . How could it have been shown at Venice without the knowledge even of its director , Akira Kurosawa , who told me the story ? The clue to this mystery had been given to me in Tokyo by Mr. Soga , the managing director of Daiei , the company that produced " Ugetsu " and " Gate of Hell " as well as " Rashomon . " Soga had gone to the United States in 1950 . One evening at a party a well-meaning woman had said to him , " Oh , Mr. Soga , do you have a movie industry in Japan too ? " ( In that year , 215 feature films were produced in Japan , and about 330 in 1954 . ) Soga was angry . Without saying very much about it in Japan , he sent " Rashomon " to Venice . It was not a film that the Japanese liked very much . Its abstract way of looking at the nature of justice is alien to the Japanese mind , and its dialogue is rather rough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , and foreigners could not judge the dialogue . Obviously Soga chose well . The crowning of " Rashomon " acted as a peculiar sort of goad to the Japanese . They deplored the particular choice , but could not help wondering how the Western world would react to better films . They meant to find out . Yet this alone probably would not have released the great surge of artistry of the past three or four years . Political , economic , and psychological conditions paved the way . During the Occupation , Japan was ashamed of its past . The public preferred foreign films or contemporary problem films , and the producers shunned historical themes . This worked havoc among directors and cameramen trained , as I shall show , to use ten centuries of aesthetic tradition to achieve their finest effects . A few good contemporary films were made , but all too often Japanese good taste disappears when it cuts loose from tradition . Nevertheless , the under-capitalized film industry was glad to follow public taste , and to avoid expensive historicals . When " Rashomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An economic boom came in the wake of the Korean War . The end of the Occupation , with its subtle psychological restraints , was foreshadowed . Japan stopped being ashamed of its past , and the trend toward " cultural reaction " set in . The producers dreamed of luring away more of their audience from foreign films , and of making full and rich recreations of the Japanese past such as the spectacularly beautiful " Gate of Hell , " which in its aesthetics as well as in its theme springs straight from tradition . There was an atmosphere of release and elation in the industry . In this atmosphere the news of " Rashomon " had an electrifying effect . It prompted producers to try for quality as they never had before , and it persuaded impressionable Japanese andiJAPANESE ences that their own films could equal or surpass foreign products . The financial report of Toho , one of the big producers , for the six months ending July 1954 , announced an increase in box-office receipts , and explained complacently : " With Japanese films enjoying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred foreign films have begun to switch over to Japanese productions . " THE DIRECTOR AS PAINTER K YO T 0 ? one of the few Japanese cities not completely destroyed in the war ? is a natural center for historical films . As Japan 's ancient capital , it has never yielded much to modernity or to Western influence . The people of Kyoto talk with a drawl and amble when they walk ; Tokyoites joke about the slowness of life there , but many like to go to Kyoto for a holiday , to relax , they say , but in truth to feel more Japanese again . Some of the big companies maintain studios in both places , and take advantage of the differences . At the Daiei Kyoto studio there is very little bustle ; it is preoccupied with the past and with obscure research . When I went to see the studio manager , Shin Sakai , he was fretting over his failure to discover exactly what Chinese underwear was like in the Tang period the outer garments are shown in paintings ) , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various professors of Chinese history in Japan , but their best information had come from the School of Oriental Studies at London University . I left Mr. Sakai to his troubles , and went out to one of the six sound stages being used to film an important historical , which they were calling " A Story by Chikamatsu . " Chikamatsu is the Shakespeare of Japan , and his name has more box-office value than the original title of his play . It was being made by Kenji Mizoguchi , perhaps the most gifted Japanese director , especially of period films . To his credit are " Ugetsu , " which has been released here , and " Sansho the Lord Bailiff , " by far the best Japanese film I have seen . His cameraman was Kazuo Miyagawa , a fine artist who had worked with him on these films , and also with Akira Kurosawa on " Rashomon . " Mizoguchi is a distinguished-looking , rather-chubby man of sixty , with gray hair and glasses , who is treated with great deference and ad-HARPER 'S dressed as sensei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about practical problems , such as the shooting time for Japanese pictures . It is about the same as that for American pictures , but the preparation time is much shorter , since errors and delays are not so expensive . And the films are released so quickly that I saw " The Story of Chikamatsu " three weeks later . Mizoguchi pointed out Miyagawa to me , short , young-looking , merry , and outspoken , wearing a pink sports jacket and a beret . I was surprised to hear that he is forty-seven . He was much too busy to talk then , but at noon we went over to a big conference room . - There , over tea and sweet cakes , Mizoguchi spoke of more subtle differences between American and Japanese pictures , and propounded an interesting theory . In Japanese films the scenes are usually small , intimate , and unspectacular , but very intense , and perhaps for that reason better acted and more human . Mizoguchi thought it had something to do with the kind of life the Japanese lead ? " narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have an abnormal sensitivity to the nuances of human encounters , so they like to watch two people sitting opposite each other on the floor of a room for what seems to us a very long time . And then lie said something that I had been waiting to hear ever since I had noticed the remarkable resemblance between the photography in " Ugetsu " and classical ink paintings : the relationship between the movies and painting in Japan is so strong that it is considered part of the national character . Mizoguchi said that Americans love action ; for us the motion-picture camera is made to catch motion . But Japanese camera work is contemplative , like Japanese painting . It seeks to extract or to abstract the simplest possible symbols of emotion from vague or empty backgrounds . Miyagawa , who had been waiting respectfully for Mizoguchi to pause , took this as his cue . He himself is an accomplished painter in the classical ink technique . He always brings paper and ink on location , and paints continuously until he has the effect he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese air and the volcanic scenery help to produce the hazy , dreamy effects of classical painting , they are sometimes not enough , and . he brings the action into the studio , where he can produce an atmosphere of deeper mist by painting back drops with an air brush . MAGAZINE Mizoguchi said that in spite of the feeling of abundant physical space in the West , our outdoor views always seem to him too near , too short . The Japanese , crowded in their narrow islands , crave physical space , and try for distance and depth in their shots . A PASSION FOR SPACE 1- ATER .. / the use f a eda , whom in K a makura , painting contrasts the strong , pure line with empty space . The best painters ( and cameramen ) are those who can increase the space without losing its suggestiveness , and reduce the painting to its fewest elemental lines . Indeed , there is a saying that the space is everything , the painter nothing . The Western painter composes within a framed space , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect detail toward a vague , unframed void . This is exactly what the Japanese cameraman strives for . The camera can not photograph blank space ; it reaches toward this effect by devices such as short focus on the foreground , the massive use of shadows and very little lighting , and the exaggeration of Japan 's misty atmosphere . A marvelous example is the lake scene in " IIgetsu , " when Genjuro the potter is trying to escape from the bandits . In the foreground are a few delicate reeds , sharply defined . Beyond is the black mass of the boat and its passengers , also mortal but more indeterminate . And beyond that are the reaches of the mist , from which anything may come . And when finally the boat bearing the dying man drifts down on Genjuro 's boat , one expects nothing less than MY AFFAIR WITH some demon . Here are beauty and terror , brought to the eye with a power of suggestion beyond anything in our films . THE COLOR OF SHADOWS IZOGUCHI was now in great form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sunny conference room , but even the flash bulbs did n't make him pause . He was talking about color . He said that Hollywood strives for natural color but that to the Japanese color is style , in movies as in paintings . Holly-wood colors bother them so much that they make special subdued prints of American color films . The best Japanese photographers deliberately understate , merely suggesting natural colors , not trying to reproduce them . The technical processes are usually American , but the artistic effects are entirely Japanese . And each period of history has its own traditional palette . That of the Heian Period of " Gate of Hell , " eight hundred years ago , is full of mauves and browns and dark greens . We respond instinctively to its physical beauty . Without knowing how the effect was achieved , our eyes are delighted by the stylized use of color. * Miyagawa , the cameraman , broke in to explain how difficult it is to show the color of shadows . The Japanese have a cult of shadows , of the dimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Junichiro Tanizaki , in an essay called " In Praise of Shadows , " said that he finds it hard really to be at ease with things that shine and glitter and define themselves too sharply . He believes that the deep , heavy roof of the Japanese house has accustomed the Japanese to hiving in dimness , and has thrown its shadow over traditional culture . And so it has , in literature , in painting , and certainly in the movies . The pressure for brighter , non-traditional , and unpleasantly gaudy films such as " Golden De- * Some time ago , the Japanese developed a process called " Fuji-Color , " but it was unsatisfactory . The effects of the war , and the lack of dollars afterward , blocked technical progress until 1950 or 1951 . The Eastman laboratories got Warner Brothers to invite a number of Japanese technicians to the United States , paying all expenses , and of course introducing them along the way to Eastman Color , which is now used almost exclusively in Japan . But any good color process can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palettes and the underlying color sense are Japanese . man " - conies front Western-minded : people between the ages of fifteen and twenty-foie , who make up 70 per cent of the audience . Mizoguchi said his greatest problem is grasping their point of view . He himself is an old-fashioned man who has steeped himself in the atmosphere of Kyoto , the museum city , and absorbed its languid , subtle moods . Most of his distinguished films appeal to older people who like quieter colors and tempo . Fortunately for him , the prestige of the elders is still strong in the Orient , so his work is admired even by young people who prefer films of a different sort . Mizoguchi now began to relate specific qualities in Japanese films to the national character , remarking that they rely very little on spectacles and tricky plots , but more on ingensei ? human feeling . The Japanese have certainly learned to protract and explore an emotional situation to its utmost . If a woman must be told ? of her husband 's death , if a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is going away for a few days ) , if a boy must give up some cherished ambition to please his father , the scene is likely to be long ? and , in a mill-run picture , sickeningly mawkish . But in the best Movies the stylized exaggeration of emotion ( as when the wife weeps in " Rashomon " ) can reach notable artistic heights . My admiration for Mizoguchi as an artist increased when , ten days later in Tokyo , I saw his masterpiece , " Sansho the Lord Bailiff . " With magnificent realism and intense human feeling , it tells a story of the days of slavery in medieval Japan , and of the premature attempt of an idealistic provincial governor , against the opposition of powerful landlords , to free the slaves in his province . The power of the acting , the costumes , the dramatic tension of each scene , especially the one in which the dead governor 's son returns to confront Sansho , the most terrible of the masters , and , above all , the photography , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more Japanese movies and talked to many more movie people , but as the time for my departure drew near , I had not yet met Akira Kurosawa , who directed " Rashomon , " " Ikiru ( To Live ) , " and " Seven Samurai , " and is today the Japanese director best known abroad . He was reported to be cloistered , working on a new script . I did not realize what this meant until Kurosawa himself later told me that he directs only one movie a year , and that he always writes his own scripts . Finally , on my very last day , I got my appointment . It was a fine , sunny morning . The studio , the one I had visited in 1946 , had greatly changed . Then everything had been shabby and dirty ; doors did not function ; windows were broken ; camera dollies were held together with wire . Now the white stucco buildings were trim and gay in the sunlight . Then people wandered in aimlessly . Now a chain was stretched across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been quite warm in the sunshine , but the office into which I was ushered was so piercingly cold that I dreaded taking notes there . Kurosawa soon came in , tall , attractive , with long black hair slicked back . He wore a navy blue , zippered byrdcloth jacket , dark green slacks , and heavy brown shoes . Before he had a chance to sit down , Mr. Amemiya , the studio manager , suggested , to my relief , that we use his well heated office . Kurosawa did not relax in the warmth . The interview was a nuisance for him . He sat forward in his chair and ran the thumbs of one hand back and forth over the knuckles of the other . For a time I could only draw perfunctory factual information from him . He was born in 1910 , has worked in the movie industry for fifteen years , and has been a director for ten . Then I asked him why Japanese films recently had won so many prizes . Everyone else had evaded that question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most Japanese do not have analytical minds , falling back on tradition or sensibility for their judgments . But Kurosawa is one of those rare ones who is intellectual in the Western sense . He answered that the Japanese have a highly developed aesthetic sense to which they have been trained since childhood . They are sensitized by long exposure to the styles , colors , and forms of various periods of the past . Thus they demand very high pictorial and photographic standards , especially in historical films whose costumes and scenes have so often been represented by famous painters . He confirmed much that Mizoguchi had said , but added that because of the traditional training of the audience , it is a much better judge of historical than of contemporary films . He credited the prizes to this discriminating pictorial sense , and also to thesuperb color sense of the Japanese . What to them are quite ordinary accomplishments , such as the palette of " Gate of Hell , " captivate the European judges . But " Gate of Hell " was only the fifth feature-length color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied until films have recaptured the formalized palette of certain other ancient periods , so subtle , so quiet . so full of soft minor tones and shadows . Kurosawa then began to analyze Japan 's foreign successes in detail . All the prize films except " To Live " have been historical , that is , costume drama with an exotic appeal . He thinks this imbalance misrepresents his country abroad , and he wants passionately , like so many other Japanese , to export fine contemporary films to show , as a matter of national pride , that Japan is a modern country . Although he directed To Live , " he considers it unsuitable for export because it is too full of Japanese manners and mannerisms . But some other contemporary films are very good indeed . Why , asked Mr. Amemiya , who was still with us , had none received recognition abroad ? Because the world was interested only in quaint customs ? Because modern Japanese in Western clothes look just off-beat enough to seem ridiculous , and not different enough to seem exotic ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which rarely is translated well in titles ? Kurosawa said he would like to do an international subject in an international manner . He admires the realism of Italian films , and the fantasy and humor of French films . He thinks that Japanese situations treated similarly would be universally comprehensible . I asked whether such films would retain any Japanese characteristics , and he answered that while he would use the most advanced techniques , he would preserve a special Japanese style of beauty . Then , as if he himself knew that his answer did not ring true , he shook his head and said that the old beauty of Japan is disappearing anyhow . BUT I was wrong , he thought , in stressing the conflict only of native and foreign tastes . Even within Japan he faced similar conflicts . For instance , the music of " Rashotnon " was Western . He had hardly any choice , since the young Japanese today rarely understood the music of so remote a period . He was studying old silent films , to try to gauge the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad scene sadder , he said , while sad music merely makes it lugubrious . He thought it was a mere chance that had made him famous abroad , and left other excellent Japanese directors unknown . He mentioned specifically Keisuke Kinoshita , of whom I had heard a great deal , and Tadashi Imai , of whom I had heard even more , since he was the center of a violent controversy . By all accounts Imai is extremely talented , and the beneficiary of a bit of Japanese McCarthyism that backfired . In 1952-53 the five biggest companies carried out a Red purge . Many of the purgees , among them Imai , began to make their own films , sometimes with the support of left-wing organizations . Many of these are low-budget tendentious quickies , made to be shown within a few weeks of such events as the H-bomb fall-out . But sonic , including two by Imai , are very good : his " School of Echoes , " a searching examination of conditions in elementary schools ; and his " Tower of Lilies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imai was employed by one of the Big Five , he did not use his films to propagate his political opinions . The purge freed him to do so . However , Kurosawa said , the best Japanese movies were not striving for documentary realism , but for more and more symbolic simplicity . It was something like modern painting , which started as an arbitrary simplification of the complexities of nature . Similarly , he thought , movies must start again with very simple stories , and strive to abstract a quality of light , or of color , or of form , or of mood from a complex natural scene . ACTING AND IMMORALITY A CTING styles are usually influenced directly and exclusively by the Kabuki Theater , but Kurosawa admires the Noh style , which , in contrast , requires extreme restraint . Its actors , like Kabuki actors , are trained in a wide range of difficult acrobatic gestures . From this they develop a co-ordination used to suppress gestures , so that they are almost motionless on the Noh stage . There are some Noh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great difference in the emotional effects . In one classic , a retainer has to beat his lord to preserve his incognito . Iii the Kabuki version , the beating is violent and arouses pity for the disguised lord . In the Noh version , the beating is slight , almost symbolical , and subtly arouses pity for the retainer who must steel himself to such an act against his lord . Kurosawa sometimes mixes the two styles . In " Rashomon " the dueling scenes in the forest were in Kabuki style , and the police court scenes in Nob style . He has been able to achieve rich comic effects by presenting a humorous play in the somber Noh style . This reminded me of the brilliant comic role of the imposter samurai in his " Seven Samurai , " and I asked him if humor was not unusual in historicals . Fie denied this and said that he had created the role especially for Mifune , a talented comedian . Kurosawa always writes his screen stories with specific actors in mind , borrowing them from other companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cameramen , for the good ones are very good indeed , and so busy that they arc the production bottleneck . He misses Miyagawa , with whom he made " Rashomon , " very much . When the conversation paused , Kurosawa said that since I had asked so many questions , he wanted to ask just one . " Were Americans shocked by the immorality of ' Rashomon ' ? " For a time I had no idea what he meant . The scenes in the forest ' glade are violent , but not at all suggestive . But Kurosawa was n't thinking of that at all . He was thinking of the aristocratic lady who showed , in front of her husband , that she was drawn to the outlaw . Then I remembered the dagger . As the outlaw moved toward her prone figure , slightly , voluntarily , she lowered the point of the dagger she had drawn from her girdle . I still see Japanese movies from time to time in New York at a private dub . The seats are hard , and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the hall is too hot rather than too cold , since these Japanese have been living in America quite a while . There is nothing forbidden about these movies , but I do n't need that incentive now . Many of the films I see are trash , but even in the trash titere are moments of cinematic beauty seldom equaled by Hollywood .
