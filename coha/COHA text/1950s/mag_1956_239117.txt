The oracular old man in knickerbockers loved controversy , but he might not have liked the one going on in London only six years since his death . To mark the centennial of the birth of the 20th century 's No. 1 playwright , wit and sage , London 's critics turned their pens to fresh appraisals of George Bernard Shaw . To an extent that aroused passionate Shavians to cries of protest , many of the appraisers found both the man and his works wanting . Sample second thoughts of those who joined in the sport of tearing down : <P> Oxford Don A. J. P. TAYLOR , in the Observer-Sooner or later we must ask-what of Shaw as a writer ? Still more , what of Shaw as he claimed to be , a sage and philosopher ? Will he last . . . ? Or will he be forgotten like his contemporary Stephen Phillips ? * . . . Shaw had one superlative quality . He was the greatest arguer there has ever been . . . marvelous over a short distance ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... On all serious questions Shaw came down firmly on the side of the stronger . . . Even when he glorified a heretic he took care to choose Joan of Arc-someone safely canonized and not associated with any really dangerous idea . . .

At the end of his life Shaw confessed that he stood for Nothing . <P> Critic KENNETH TYNAN , also in the Observer-He was without doubt a great writer ... He attempted , and almost pulled off , two mountainous tasks : he cleared the English stage of humbug , and the English mind of cant ... As a demolition expert he has no rivals : and we are being grossly irrelevant if we ask a demolition expert , when his work is done : " But what have you created ? " It is like expecting a bulldozer to build the Tower of Pisa ; or condemning a bayonet for not being a plough . Shaw 's genius was for intellectual slum-clearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the father of English literature , Shaw is the spinster aunt . By this I do not mean to imply that he was sexless ... It is only in his writing that the aunt in him rises up , full of warnings , wagged fingers and brandished umbrellas . . . Shaw was unique . An Irish aunt so gorgeously drunk with wit is something English literature will never see again . But there is fruit for the symbolist in the fact that , prolific as he was , he left no children .
