 | Snow : " White Gold " of the West . How the new science of snow surveying ? estimating with amazing accuracy the water content of the mountain snow packs ? is saving millions for farmers and industries ACH WINTER about 1000 men trek into the high mountains of the western United States , Canada and Alaska and carry back a treasure as valuable as any precious mineral ? more than 6o,000 exact measurements of the giant snow packs laid down by winter blizzards . These measurements foretell the amount of water that will flow down the valleys during the spring and summer ? knowledge that is vital to the prosperity of the thirsty West . The techniques they use were pioneered half a century ago by Dr. James E. Church , a professor of Latin at the University of Nevada , who had the unusual hobby of climbing the .  | high Sierras in winter to measure the yearly snowfall . One spring Lake Tahoe , on the CaliforniaNevada border , rose 18 inches over its dam , inundating water-front property . Residents angrily threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lake so low during winter that the spring melt could n't possibly cause floods . The power company faced a dilemma : if it complied with this demand , then in a dry year millions of dollars ' worth of power production , irrigation water and municipal water supplies would be lost . Ideally , they should be able to keep the lake always brimful and still avoid the danger of its spilling over . But this could be done only if they could predict the spring runoff with unprecedented accuracy . This was when Dr. Church was called in . In the winter of 1911 he went up into the mountains armed with a long hollow tube . By taking sample " cores " he was able to measure not only the depth of the snow packs but also their compactness and weight ? their moisture equivalent . So accurate were his predictions , then and in subsequent years , that a federal decree now specifies that the operation of Lake Tahoe should be based on snow-survey data . That one-man project at Lake Tahoe has now grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survey is a joint effort of some 15o industries , power companies , irrigation districts and gov ernmental agencies . The yearly cos is $400,000 ; the benefits are reckone in the tens of millions . " Today we regard snow as a crop that is every year sown by nature Its harvesting is guided by the snow scientist , " says Arch Work , head o the Cooperative Snow Survey . " A we accumulate more facts , futur water conservation gains should b tremendous . " Since some snow is light an fluffy and other snow fields ar tightly packed , water content can ' be judged merely by looking up a the snow packs from the valleys The surveyors , all volunteers , must go into the mountains ( usually in pairs for safety ) about four times a winter ? traveling on skis , in snow tractors , helicopters and planes ? to take their inventory . The data they bring down is assembled and published by the Soil Conservation Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture . SCS 's " Water Supply Forecast , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most-studied document in the West ? virtually required reading for water users in 17 states . In 1955 , farmers in one section of southern Idaho saw that the hills were mantled with snow , lots of itY and anticipated a bumper year . But surveyors found the snow very low in moisture content . Forecast figures showed the water supply would be 40 percent below normal . So the irrigators cut back acreage and , instead of such crops as alfalfa , planted dry- land wheat . They saved on seed , fertilizer and labor , and by concentrating the irrigation water on limited acreage they were able to bring to maturity the crops they did plant . Result : in this single case the forecast meant a benefit to the farmers of about $380,000 . For power companies , the forecast figures may mean the spending or saving of millions of dollars . The Pacific Gas and Electric Co. , for example , operates 57 reservoirs with a storage capacity of one and a half million acre-feet . Each acre-foot of water that PG &E; can count upon from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supplementary over generation . As early as March 1956 , snow surveyors saw signs of a flood building up in the snow packs that feed the Columbia River . Floodgates were opened all the way along the river basin , in Montana , Idaho , Washington and Oregon , and the reservoirs , usually kept at high level , were drained . So when the torrent started rushing down , each reservoir was ready to take a deep gulp . This chopped two feet off the peak of the flood , kept the river within hounds , and an estimated 37 million dollars ' damage was avoided . The snow forecasts are amazingly exact , considering the many variables involved . In some places , as on the Rogue River , the forecasts average a spectacular 92 percent accurate . Accuracy means dollars : the East Bay Municipal Utility District in California estimates that an error of a single inch in measuring the snow pack might mean a difference to it of 20,000 acre-feet of water , or some $20,000 . Snow management is a young science , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the major causes of error : a dry soil under a melting snow pack will gobble up much of the water ; an unusually wet soil may mean a flood hazard . Since 1952 SCS has been installing simple , inexpensive soil-moisture stations to measure this factor . With Homer J. Stockwell , snowsurvey supervisor of the Colorado and Rio Grande , I examined one of these units high up on the Continental Divide . Through a tall standpipe wires led down into the ground . When an electric current was passed through them , readings showed the amount of moisture present at various depths . For where the soil is wet , a lot of current will flow ; where it 's dry , the lower rate of flow tells how dry . Two years ago there was an unusually heavy snow pack along the Rio Grande in New Mexico . Using snow measurements alone , SCS would have predicted a bumper year . But the " electronic watchdogs " revealed that the soil underneath all that snow was desert-dry , and would lap up most of the run-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only half their normal water yield , but they were prepared for it . Accuracy increases , too , as more  | snow measurements are made over a wider area . The surveyors now cover nearly one third of their mileage in snowtractors , and skiequipped airplanes are providing even greater efficiency . In some remote watersheds , inaccessible during the winter months , aerial markers have been planted ? sturdy poles with a series of crossarms . Surveyors fly low over these markers and count the number of crossarms still showing above the snow ? a technique that is particularly valuable during the early winter months , when water-content measurements are less important . Using the mountain snow packs as giant outdoor test tubes , snow scientists of the U. S. Forest Service have shown that water yield can be increased , sometimes in startling amounts . At Fool Creek , in the Fraser Experimental Forest of Colorado , trees were scientifically thinned and harvested , leaving clearings where snow could fall unobstructed . In the two years since thinning , the yield of water from the Fool Creek snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because each tree captures tons of snow in its branches , where , exposed to the sun and wind , it evaporates quickly . After selective harvesting ( which is , incidentally , a valuable conservation measure ) , more snow reached the ground to join the snow pack , shaded and sheltered by the remaining trees , evaporating less . Also , it now appears that on t alpine snow fields ? those big above the timber line ? the snow rate of melt can be speeded up in drought year , held back in a w year . In experiments made in 195 untreated snow fields melted six fc in about three weeks , those dar cued with carbon black went fast while sawdust-insulated drifts me ed very slowly ? in effect keeping some of the snow in cold storage f use the next year . Dr. Church , pioneer of snow su veying , at 89 is still spry , amazing erect , full of vitality . Even in the years since World War II he has colt tinued to lope across the snow fief of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps , the Andes , the Himalayas ? climbin hundreds of miles over gruelin routes that would blanch a youn alpinist . Largely through his effor nine foreign countries now have survey networks . The science of snow has come long way in the years since Dr. Church walked into the mountain alone , and its value for the future i inestimable . Says Governor Georg D. Clyde of Utah : " We 've learner that the real gold in our Western mountains is white .
