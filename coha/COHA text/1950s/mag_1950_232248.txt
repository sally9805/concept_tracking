W-day dawned wet , cold and foggy last week . Toward noon , Chicago Tribune staffers and WGN engineers gathered expectantly in Room 833 of the Tribune Tower . Outside the window they could see a shiny brass whistle , four feet high , ten inches in diameter , which until recently had graced the West Coast steamship Yale . Now Yaleman Bertie McCormick ( ' 03 ) had acquired it for a new and loftier mission : to warn Chicagoland of an atomic-bomb raid . Before leaving for an Arizona vacation , the colonel had left orders for a test toot . <P> Just before the test , somebody warned a Trib man not to stand too close to the window ; it might shatter under the mighty blast . Precisely at noon , a Tower official pulled the lanyard . The whistle momentarily disappeared in a cloud of steam , which coursed upward for five stories . But the sound that came forth was a musical , calliope-like peep , barely audible amid the winds swirling around the Tower . Down on the streets , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day : " A thunderous bellow was emitted from the whistle 's metal throat . " <P> Completely satisfied , WGN announced that the next blast of the whistle will mean the actual approach of atomic raiders - and Trib staffers will scuttle to the Trib 's atomic-bomb shelters .
