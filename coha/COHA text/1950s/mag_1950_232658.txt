Before going to his store in Mexico City one morning last week , a bookseller put in a precautionary phone call to his head clerk . Plainclothes cops , the loyal employee reported , had been riffling through the store 's ample stock of pornographic novels and postcards , and were awaiting the owner 's arrival . The owner , however , hastened to a district judge and got a magic writ called an amparo . When he walked into the store soon afterward and the detectives tried to arrest him , he produced the amparo . With a sigh of frustration , the cops shut the books and went away . The bookseller could be reasonably sure that they would not bother him again for another three months . <P> An amparo ( literally : protection ) is a Mexican legal confection with elements of habeas corpus , stay of execution and injunction , all rolled into one . Anyone who feels that he has been or is about to be the victim of unjust police or court action may apply for an amparo . By its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a specific case until the court issuing the amparo has had a chance to review the case and decide whether the agency involved is acting within the law . Its great advantage from the lawbreaker 's point of view is that the huge backlog of amparo cases virtually guarantees a three-to four-month delay before a hearing . When the time is nearly up , the shady character can find another judge and get another amparo . <P> One way for authorities to get around the right of amparo is to carry out a sabadazo , a surprise arrest after Saturday noon , when all government offices , including the courts , are closed . But all arrests can not wait till a weekend , and besides , sabadazos are considered unsportsmanlike . This week the Mexican Senate was putting the final touches on a bill , sponsored by President Miguel Alemn , to take some of the obvious kinks out of the amparo system . <P> The new law will increase the number of tribunals dealing with amparos , and assign to each court three judges , all individually empowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure is intended to reduce the backlog of cases and insure judgment within a few days .
