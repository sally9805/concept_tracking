Hot Potato <P> Sir : <P> . . . The " Hot Potato " story TIME , April 27 raised my blood pressure to the boiling point ! As a citizen of Illinois , a public school with Roman Catholic nuns as teachers is not " perfectly acceptable , " and I would like to know what can be done to stop this sort of thing . <P> I would be just as indignant if it were Lutherans or Presbyterians . . . And I should think that Catholics would deplore it just as much as I do . It is not American . <P> KATHERINE R. SCHROEDER Hinsdale , Ill . <P> Sir : <P> We are Protestants , but as a matter of choice , our three boys go to Catholic school . My concern for Mrs. Larson was not over the legal question-she may have a case-but rather over her inability to overcome her prejudices and reap the benefits that may be had only in a school that teaches religion as an integral part of daily life . . . <P> Too long we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blamed if they grow up to believe that the three Rs and material success are more important than honor , integrity and spiritual values ? . . . <P> Mrs. Larson has labeled the textbooks and hymns Catholic , but I have studied them carefully and believe them to be merely Christian , for I have seen nothing in them that can not be verified by any standard Bible . <P> She says there are Catholic pictures on the walls and religious statues given as prizes , but it is a child 's way to collect pictures and souvenirs of those they admire . Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio have decorated half the boys ' rooms in America . Are they more worthy than Christ or the Virgin Mary , or some of the great saints of history ? . . <P> BETTIE GRANT Santa Ana , Calif . <P> Let George Do It <P> Sir : <P> In that picture of Stalin 's pallbearers TIME , April 20 , Georgy Malenkov is kidding no one , perhaps not even the onlookers , who might consider it more prudent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker , I defy anyone to try to carry a coffin with the position his hand is in . The handle would slip out of his fingers . And it is not even resting on his shoulder . And ca n't you almost hear him groaning under his burden ? Just try to carry a load and see what happens to the other arm . It just does n't drape gracefully at your side . . . <P> I 'd like to know what kind of meat they feed them on to be able to carry such heavy things like coffins onehanded . Maybe it had wheels under it , huh ? <P> TONY DIAMONTI Scranton , Pa . <P> Sir : <P> ... A very interesting photograph . . . Beria and Malenkov , at the forefront , are merely grasping the bier handles , almost at arm 's length , while Molotov is clearly out of step . . . Could it be that some unseen slaves , hidden behind the " bier curtain , " are doing the real work ? <P> JEAN R. MARTIN <P> Bellefontaine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
