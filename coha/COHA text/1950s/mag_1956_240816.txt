The Dutch royal family were miles apart last week . Queen Juliana , struggling to maintain a gracious smile after entertaining Liberia 's visiting President Tubman in The Hague , took off for a vacation in Sicily with a few of her ladies-in-waiting . Her husband , globetrotting Prince Bernhard , after elephant hunting in Tanganyika , arrived in the U.S. for a visit to Washington , New Orleans and New York . <P> <P> But it was the awareness of a deeper separation that made news in Holland last week . For the first time , the people of The Netherlands seemed to have abandoned their hope that the royal crisis would disappear if they just pretended not to notice ; for the first time , Dutch editors clamored specifically and vociferously for drastic government action to clear up that mess in Soestdijk Palace . <P> The sudden explosion of indignation in press and public was sparked by a story in London 's garish Sunday Pictorial , a newspaper which seldom earns such international attention . A Pictorial reporter had been given a lift in a limousine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidant of a man closer to the Queen than almost anyone else . " According to the reporter , the man who gave him the ride told of a plot , designed with the connivance of Prince ' Bernhard 's 72-year-old German mother , Princess Armgard , to force Queen Juliana off the throne . " Lies about the Queen 's private life , " said the man , " are being spread in a deliberate and nasty way with but one aim-to put Princess Beatrix the eldest daughter of Juliana and Bernhard on the throne , with her father and her paternal grandmother at her side . " A quick check on the registration number of his automobile , said the Pictorial , revealed the man to be none other than Johann G. van Maasdijk , board chairman of the firm that publishes the influential De Telegraaf , and a palace chamberlain " in extraordinary service " to the Queen . <P> Admitting only that he had given the British newsman a lift , Van Maasdijk promptly denied the rest of the story . But whether the Pictorial spoke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole thing was " a shameful affair which shows the necessity not only of being in earnest about changes at the court but also of making haste .
