As it comes to all Hearst sons , a top Hearst job came last week to Randolph Apperson Hearst , 34 . After three years as executive editor , then associate publisher , handsome , slick-haired Randy Hearst took over as full-fledged publisher of Hearst 's San Francisco Call-Bulletin ( circ. 152,135 ) . Randy , who had broken in as a cub on his father 's San Francisco Examiner , was thus even up with twin brother David , publisher of the Los Angeles Herald &; Express , and older brother William Randolph Jr. , publisher of the New York Journal-American . <P> The change came as a swap : down to Randy 's old job stepped a veteran newsman , Edmond D. Coblentz , 67 , able publisher of the Call-Bulletin for the last ten years , who wanted to take things easier . For " Cobbie , " who likes to sport a cane and carnation , it was the first letup in 50 years of hustling for Hearst as reporter and editor . Cobbie himself announced the change at a San Francisco banquet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam Goldwyn and assorted top Hearst brass , and was given a memento of his San Francisco days . The gift : a cable car .
