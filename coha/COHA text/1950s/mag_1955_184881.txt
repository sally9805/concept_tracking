Donald Maclean was sandy-haired , tall , with great latent physical strength , but fat and rather flabby . Meeting him , one was conscious of both amiability and weakness . He did not seem a political animal but resembled the clever , helpless youth in a Huxley novel , an outsize Cherubino intent on amorous experience but too shy and clumsy to succeed . He sought refuge on the more impetuous and emancipated fringes of Bloomsbury and Chelsea . <P> Guy Burgess , though he preferred the company of the able to the artistic , also moved on the edge of the same world . He was of a very different physique , tall-medium in height , with blue eyes , an inquisitive nose , sensual mouth , curly hair and alert fox-terrier expression . He was immensely energetic , a great talker , reader , boaster , walker , who swam like an otter and drank , not like a feckless undergraduate as Donald was apt to do , but like some Rabelaisian bottle-swiper whose thirst was unquenchable . <P> Thus British Critic Cyril Connolly once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Money Burgess , 44 , and Donald Duart Maclean , 42 . Last week the British government , prodded by the revelations of Vladimir Petrov , the Russian MVD boss who defected in Australia , told a bit more about the British spies who escaped in 1951 and are now apparently alive somewhere behind the Iron Curtain . The 3,500-word white paper was not the whole story , but with the facts contributed by Petrov , it made possible for the first time a cohesive account of The Case of the Missing Spies . <P> Recruited . Their treason began in the middle ' 30s at Cambridge , where apparently wild-minded Guy Burgess , the well-schooled son of a Royal Navy officer , first met Donald Maclean , son of a former Cabinet minister and a young man with a promising future . Both moved in Communist circles . It was just before the Spanish Civil War , and both were outspoken in their dissatisfaction with the conduct of world affairs , Maclean to the point of declaring that he wanted to work for the Russians . It was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Soviet espionage service . Maclean entered the Foreign Office . Burgess took to journalism , joined the BBC , transferred to a propaganda section of the War Office with the outbreak of World War II . Maclean was already carving out a brilliant career in the Paris embassy and spending his spare moments at Left Bank spots . At the Caf Flore he met a pretty American girl named Melinda Marling , who amused him by smoking cigars . They were married just before the fall of France , and went on together to London , and four years later to Washington . <P> As head of chancery in the British embassy , almost all secret documents relating to the allied effort in war and peace between 1944 and 1948 passed through Maclean 's hands . He was also secretary of the Combined Policy Committee on Atomic Developments , with a pass which admitted him to the U.S. AEC offices at any time of day or night . With his pretty wife and two young children , Maclean outwardly seemed like the perfect young diplomat . But behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to tell . <P> He began drinking heavily , and preferred what he called his " ashcan life " and " craggy characters " to the Washington social round .
