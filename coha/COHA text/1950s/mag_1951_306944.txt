At the same time it believes that we must not use our air power to neutralize supply buildups and air bases in Manchuria , because using force in war may provoke Russia . <P> If at first glance this policy seems confusing and inconsistent , perhaps it may be clarified by comparing it with a fire chief who sends firemen to House A , which is not on fire , while denying a fire hose to the firemen fighting the fire at House B. The theory being that the fire hose will cause the blaze at House B to get bigger . <P> RAYMOND H.
