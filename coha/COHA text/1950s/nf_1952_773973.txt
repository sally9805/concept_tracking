True centrifugal casting is used for pipe , liners , and symmetrical objects which are cast by rotating the mold about its horizontal or vertical axis . The metal is held against the wall of the mold by centrifugal force , and no core is required to form a true cylindrical cavity on the inside . This method is illustrated by the casting machine shown in Figure 12 designed for the production of steel or cast-iron pipe . The wall thickness of the pipe produced is controlled by the amount of metal poured into the mold . Another example of true centrifugal casting is shown in Figure 13 , which illustrates two methods that may be used for casting radial-engine cylinder barrels . The horizontal method of casting is similar to the process followed in casting pipe lengths , and the inside diameter is a true cylinder requiring a minimum amount of machining . In vertical castings the inside cavity takes the form of a paraboloid as illustrated by the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the speed of rotation , the dotted lines at A representing a higher rotational speed than shown by the paraboloid B. In order to reduce the inside-diameter differences between the top and bottom of the cylinder , spinning speeds are higher for vertical casting than for horizontal casting . Radial-engine cylinder castings produced by this process are shown in Figure 14 and illustrate the rough casting , the cylinder after rough machining , and the finished cylinder with its cooling fins . As the name implies , semicentrifugal casting is the rotating of the mold about its vertical axis . In this method the center of the casting is usually solid , and the ( micaity is machined uul later // castings made in a mold depends on the size of the casting and the convenience in handling and assembling the molds . Rotational speeds for this form of centrifugal casting are not so great as for the true centriliigal process . " l'Ite process produces a dense structure at the // outer circumference where it is needed , while the center metal is machined out . In the centrifuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mold , and metal is fed to these cavities by radial sprues or gates from the center of the mold . Either single or stack molds can be used . The mold cavities are filled under pressure from the centrifugal force of the metal as the mold is rotated . In Figure 16 are shown five castings made in one mold by this process . The internal cavities of these castings are irregular in shape and are formed by dry-sand cores . The centrifuge method , not limited to symmetrical objects , can produce castings of irregular shape such as bearing caps or small brackets . For many years the dental pro-fession has used this process for the casting of gold inlays . The average rotational speed* for miscellaneous centrifugal castMethods // ings approximates 600 surface feet per minute , although for cast-iron pipe the speeds may be as high as 1250 feet per minute . Too great a speed may result in surface cracks caused by high stresses set up in the mold . The rotational speed depends on the kind of mold used ( whether sand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vertical ) , the size of casting , and the kind of metal being cast . Centrifugal casting reduces cost by its advantages over other methods . Cores in cylindrical shapes and risers or feedheads are both elimi-nated . The castings have a dense metal structure with all impurities forced back to the center where frequently they can be machined out . Because of the pressure exerted on the metal , thinner sections can be cast than would be possible in static casting . Finally , any metal can be cast by this process . It must be remembered , however , that all castings can not be made centrifugally , since there are definite size and shape limitations . " Lost-wax " casting process . This process* derives its name from the fact that the wax pattern used in the process is subsequently melted from the mold , leaving a cavity having all the details of the original pattern . The process as originally practiced by artisans in the 16th century consisted of forming the object in wax by hand . The wax object or pattern was then covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mold was heated in an oven , Hinting the wax and at the same time further drying and hardening // the mold . The remaining cavity , having all the intricate details of the original wax form , was then filled with metal . Upon cooling , the plaster investment was broken away leaving the desired casting . One advantage of this process was that intricate forms having undercuts could be reproduced , since the mold did not have to be opened for the pattern to be removed . In large castings , such as statuary , * plaster cores were used to provide relatively thin walls in the casting . The procedure followed in this process is first to prepare one or more master patterns of steel or brass which are replicas of the part to be cast . Using these patterns a bismuth- or lead-alloy split mold is cast , similar to the one shown in Figure 17 . The mold is properly finished and gated and is then ready for use in forming the wax patterns . In the forming operation , the mold is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injected into it under considerable // pressure . Thermoplastic polystyrene resin is sometimes used in place of wax . Upon solidification , the wax patterns are removed from the mold and are ready for final assembly . In this operation several patterns are usually assembled together with necessary gates and risers and by heating the contact surfaces ( wax welding ) with a hot wire held to correct temperature by electrical resistance . The patterns are then ready to be placed in a metal flask and surrounded by a refractory plaster . This may be done by pouring into the flask a finely ground refractory material thinned by some mixing agent as alcohol or water . However , the procedure is generally to dip or spray the patterns first with a fine silica-flour mixture to insure having a smooth surface on the castings ( see Figure 18 ) , and then fill the flask with a coarser plaster mixture . After the plaster sets , the mold is placed upside down and heated in an oven for several hours to melt out the wax and to dry the mold . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , or centrifugal casting . Pressures ranging from 3 to 30 pounds per square inch arc generally used in the casting operation . When the mold has cooled , the plaster is broken away . Alter gates and feeders are cut off , the castings arc finally cleaned by grinding , sand blasting , or other finishing operations . Plaster-mold casting . The use of plaster as a casting investment has had limited use for many years , but recent improvement in its ability to dry quickly with sufficient porosity has greatly accelerated its use as a modern casting material . Compared with sand molds , it has a higher molding cost , but the advantages gained by close tolerance , fine detail , and good surface finish enable it to be economically used in short and medium production runs . The molds are not permanent , being destroyed in the process of removing the castings . Patterns are made of ? a free-machining brass and are held to a close tolerance . They are assembled on bottom plates of standard-size flasks ( usually 10 by 18 by 3 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in Figure 19 . Before receiving the plaster , they are sprayed with a parting compound . The plaster , which is made of gypsum with added strengtheners and settling agents , is dry mixed , and water is added . It is then poured over the patterns , and the mold is vibrated slightly to insure the plaster filling all small cavities . The plaster sets in a few minutes and is removed from the flask by a vacuum head . All moisture is driven from the molds by baking them in an oven conveyor at a temperature around 1500 F. These molds are shown in Figure 20 as they ale emerging from the drying oven . After pouring , the castings // are removed by breaking up the mold , any surplus plaster being removed by a washing operation . Mold porosity for the removal of any gases developed in the mold is controlled by the water content of the plaster . When the mold is dried , the water driven out leaves numerous fine passageways which act as vents . The amount of water added originally is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster and provides the excess of voids needed for venting . In addition to having adequate porosity , plaster molds have the necessary structural strength for casting , plus enough elasticity to allow some contraction of the metal during its cooling . Plaster molds arc suitable only for nonferrous alloys having casting temperatures not much over 2100 F. While plaster has proved to be an excellent mold material for yellow brass , certain bronzes and aluminum alloys may also be used . The wide variety of small-size castings made by this process includes miscellaneous airplane parts , small gears , cams , handles , pump parts , small housings , and numerous other intricate castings . One of the principal advantages of plaster-mold casting is the resulting high degree of dimensional accuracy . This , coupled with the smooth surface obtained , enables the process to compete favor-ably with sand casting in producing parts requiring a considerable amount of machining . Because of the low thermal conductivity of plaster , the metal does not chill rapidly , and very thin sections may be cast . There is little tendency towards internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sand or other // inclusions . In general , the process competes more successfully with die casting using the high-temperature alloys such as brass rather than metals such as zinc and aluminum . At high temperatures , metal molds have a relatively short life ; with plaster molds , which are used only once , the temperature is no problem . A tolerance of ? 0.005 inch can be maintained for simple castings ; slightly more is required if the dimension crosses the parting line . The process can be used for both small and quantity production runs . Molds from mercury patterns . A casting process utilizing frozen mercury and known as the Mercast process* has been developed for the production of precision castings . A metal mold or die is first made of the part to be cast with the necessary gates and sprue hole . When assembled and ready for pouring , it is partially immersed in a cold bath and filled with acetone which acts as a lubricant . As the mercury is poured into the mold , the acetone is displaced . Freezing takes place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete in about 10 minutes . The patterns are then removed from the mold and invested in a cold ceramic slurry by repeated dippings until a shell about 1/8 inch thick is built up . Mercury is melted and removed from the shell at room temperature , and , after a short drying period , it is fired at a high temperature resulting in a hard permeable form . The shell is then placed in a flask , surrounded by sand , preheated , and filled with metal . Casting is usually done by the centrifugal method . // Castings produced by this method are accurate in detail , have a smooth surface , and , for small castings , maintain a tolerance of 4-0.002 inch per inch . Both ferrous and nonferrous metals can be cast by this process , the maximum pouring temperature being around 3000 F. Wide commercial use of this process is limited by the high cost of the castings . Croning process. * The mold in this process is made up of a mixture of sand and phenolic resin formed into two thin half-mold shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shown in the upper part of Figure 21 , are made in a molding machine on a hot metal pattern and baked in an oven for 1 to 2 minutes for additional hardening . After the two mold halves are assembled , they are placed in a flask and surrounded by steel shot or similar material to give the shell mold adequate support to resist the pressure of the // liquid metal . Metal is poured into the mold in the usual manner , and the casting , upon solidification , is easily removed from the shell . No special venting is required as the gases readily escape through the shell mold . Castings produced by this method are clean and smooth and require little subsequent finishing , and tolerances of 0.002 to 0.003 inch per inch can be maintained . Metals that have been cast by this process include brass , bronze , aluminum , cast iron , and steel . Molds of other materials . Various materials such as rubber , paper , and wood can he used for molds for casting of low-melting-temperature metals . Costume jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * A two-piece rubber casing is vulcanized over a mold or pattern which , when complete , serves as the mold . Casting is by centrifugal means , and metal temperatures up to 600 F can be used . The flexibility of the mold permits intricate designs with under-cuts , but close dimensional accuracy can not be maintained . An alloy of 98% tin , 1% copper , and I% antimony is frequently used in this work . Full-page newspaper type is cast in a mold ( called a " mat " ) upon which the type and illustration impressions have been made on damp paper . The type metal is poured into the mold after the paper is dry . End-grain wood may also be used as a mold material for low-melting alloys where only a limited number of simple castings are desired . Continuous Casting Research and experimental work has proved that there are many opportunities for saving in the continuous casting of metals . Briefly the process consists of continuously pouring molten metal into a mold which has the facilities for rapidly chilling the metal to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following processes are typical of those itt use or in the process of development . Reciprocating mold process. - In the process shown in Figure 22 a reciprocating water-cooled copper mold is used , the down stroke being synchronized with the discharge rate of the slab . Molten metal is poured into the holding furnace shown and is discharged to the mold through a 12-inch tube at the rate of 20,000 pounds per hour . The molten metal is distributed across the mold from a submerged // horizontal cross piece , the level of the metal being held constant at all times . The pouring rate of the molten metal is controlled by a needle valve through the top of the holding furnace . As the metal becomes chilled in the lower part of the mold , it is discharged at a constant rate and enters the withdrawing rolls . These are syn-chronized with the downward movement of the mold and are mounted just above a circular saw which cuts the slab to desired lengths . Brass slabs produced by this process are further processed by cold rolling into sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in Figure 23 , differs from other continuous processes in that the forming die or mold is integral with the furnace and there is no problem of controlling the flow of metal . The metal is fed by gravity into the mold from the furnace as it is continuously solidified and withdrawn by the rolls below . An important feature of this process is the water-cooled graphite forming die which is self-lubricating , has excellent resistance to thermal shock , and is not attacked by copper-base alloys . The upper end , being in the molten metal , acts as a riser- and compensates for any shrinkage taking place during solidification while simultaneously // acting as an effective path for the dissipation of evolved gases . These dies are easily machined to desired shapes , and products may be produced ranging from /G to 5A/ inches in diameter . Multiple production from a single die permits casting the small section rods . In starting the process , a rod of the same shape as that to be cast is placed between the drawing rolls and inserted into the die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloy to be cast . As the molten metal enters the die , it melts the end surface of the rod forming a perfect joint . The casting cycle is then started by the drawing rolls , and the molten metal is continuously solidified as it is chilled and withdrawn from the die . As the casting leaves the furnace , it ulti mately reaches the sawing floor where it is cut to desired lengths while still in motion . A tilting receiver takes the work and drops it to a horizontal position , and from there it goes to inspecting and straight ening operations . The process has proved successful for phosphorized copper and many of the standard bronzes . The alloy compositions may be produced , with satisfactory commercial finish , as rounds , tubes , squares , or special shapes . Physical properties are superior to permanent-mold ; 111 ( 1 sand castings. // Williams continuous-casting process. * Developed for continuous casting of carbon and alloy steels , this process utilizes thin-walled brass molds having cross-sectional areas up to 15 square inches . These molds are preferably oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured into the mold from an electric holding furnace at a rate controlled by the metal level in the mold . The mold must of necessity be con structed of a material having a high heat conductivity and one that is not easily wetted by the liquid metal . Rapid mold cooling is essential for the success of this process , and results in improved mold life , less segregation , smaller grain structure , and a better surface . Actually the metal next to the mold wall solidifies only a few inches below the top surface and shrinks slightly from the mold sides . As the cast section leaves the cooled mold , it passes through a section that controls the rate of cooling , then to the drawing and straightening rolls . Below this point it is cut to desired lengths by an oxyacetylene torch and finally lowered to a horizontal position . Steel blooms and billets produced by this process have good crystalline structure , little segrega tion , uniform section , and a size close to that required for many rolling mills . Alcoa direct-chill process. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace through a refractory trough into shallow stationary molds , the bottoms of which rest on a hydraulic elevator . When the metal at the bottom of the mold becomes chilled , the elevator drops at a rate of 2 to 5 inches per minute . As the ingots descend , they are sprayed with water to complete their solidification . This process is shown diagrammatically in Figure 24 although , in actual practice , three ingots are usually cast instead of two as shown . The shallow molds used are made in sizes of 12 by 36 and 12 by 48 inches and are rectangular in shape , although other sizes and circular shapes can be cast if desired . The length of the ingots is regulated to give a convenient size for rolling and is usually 136 inches . This process leaves a rough surface on the ingots which must be removed by milling before they can be further processed in the rolling mill . Most of the aluminum used in the United States is cast by this process . Direct casting of sheet ( Howlett process ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various metals into sheet form between water-cooled rolls , as is clone in the nr , untfacture of glass by the conReview // tinuous method . So far this process has not proved commercially successful , owing to the fact that the metal solidifies faster at the edges ol : the strip than at the center and , consequently , builds up a greater thickness at the edges than is desired . This forces the cooling rolls apart which changes the sheet thickness . Also , in casting solid-solution alloys , the process is affected by segregation problems resulting ultimately in wide variations of metal analysis . Some progress has been made in the elimination of these difficulties by increasing rolling speeds and reducing the contact area that the metal has with the rolls . // CHAPTER // Heat treatment is the operation of heating and cooling a metal or alloy in its solid state . Steel responds to this treatment in a unique fashion : its physical properties can be greatly changed according to the procedure involved . Therefore , the purpose of heat treating is to enhance certain desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been machined can be made hard to resist cutting action and abrasion , whereas another part , already hard , can be softened so that further machine work can be done . With the proper treatment , internal stresses may be removed , grain size reduced , toughness increased , or a hard surface produced on a ductile interior . To use the correct treatment for desired properties , the analysis of the steel must be known ; for small percentages of certain elements , notably carbon , greatly change the physical properties . The following discussion applies principally to the ordinary commercial steels known as carbon steels , in which carbon is the controlling element . Alloy steels are those that owe their properties in a marked degree to the presence of one or more elements other than carbon . The elements used in the manufacture of alloy steels include nickel , chromium , manganese , molybdenum , tungsten , silicon , vanadium , copper , and cobalt . Their greatly improved physical properties enable alloy steels to fulfill many important commercial applications not possible with carbon steels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bronze given similar treatments will not react the same , because of the nature of the elements it contains . For example , if the bronze were in a hardened state from cold working , it could be softened by heating followed by any rate of cooling . For steel , on the other hand , the rate of cooling is a controlling factor . Rapid cooling from above the critical point results in a hard structure , whereas very slow cooling has the opposite effect . To understand these changes , a knowledge of the structure of steel and its various constituents is necessary . I2 ! // Iron ? Iron-Carbide Diagram Under conditions of equilibrium , the knowledge of steel and its structure is best summarized iii the iron ? iron-carbide diagram shown in Figure 1 . If a piece of 0.20% carbon steel is slowly and uniformly heated and its temperature recorded at definite intervals of time , a temperature ? time curve similar to Figure 2 will be obtained . From this curve there are three temperatures where the heating rate changes . These same three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperature above 16(11) F but will also occur ; it slightly lower // temperatures . These points are known as critical points where structural changes occur and are designated by the symbols Act , Ac. , , and Ac. ; . The letter c is the initial letter of the French word chauffage , meaning " heating . " The points on the cooling curve are designated by Art , Arm , and Ar. , , the r being taken from the word refroidissement , meaning " cooling . " Certain changes which take place at these critical points are called allotropic changes . Although the chemical content of the steel remains the same , its properties are changed . Principal among these are changes in electrical resistance and atomic structure and loss of magnetism . By definition , an allotropic change is a reversible change in the atomic structure of the metal with a corresponding change in the properties of the steel . These critical points should be known , as most heat-treating processes require heating the steel to a temperature above this range . Steel can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the upper critical range . If a series of time ? temperature heating curves are made for steels of different carbon contents and the corresponding critical points plotted on a temperature ? per-cent carbon curve , a diagram similar to Figure 1 would be obtained . This diagram , which applies only under slow cooling conditions , is known as a partial iron ? iron-carbide diagram . // Consider again the piece of 0.20% C steel which has been heated to a temperature around 1600 F. Above the Ar ; point this steel is a solid solution of carbon in gamma iron and is called austenite . The iron atoms lie in a face-centered cubic structure and are nonmagnetic . Upon cooling this steel , the iron atoms start to form a body-centered cubic lattice below the Ar 3 point . This new structure that is being formed is called ferrite or alpha iron and is a solid solution of carbon in alpha iron . The solubility of carbon in alpha iron is very much less than in gamma iron . At the Ar9 point the steel becomes magnetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , additional ferrite is formed . At the Art line the austenite that remains is transformed to a new structure called pearlite . This constituent is lamellar in appearance under high magnification , the lamellae being alternately ferrite and iron carbide . It is called pearlite because of its " mother of pearl " appearance . It is shown under high magnification in Figure 3 . As the carbon content of the steel increases above 0.20% , the temperature at which the ferrite is first rejected from the austenite drops until , at about 0.80% carbon , no ferrite is initially rejected from the austenite . This steel is called eutectoid steel and consists of 100% pearlite in structure composition . The eutectoid point in any metal is the lowest temperature at which changes occur in a solid solution . If the carbon content of the steel is greater than the eutectoid , a new line is observed in the iron ? iron-carbide diagram labeled Acrn . This line denotes the temperature at which iron carbide is first elected Iron the austenite instead of ferrite . The iron // carbide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely hard and brittle . Steels containing less carbon than the eutectoid are known as hypoeutectoid steels , and those with more carbon are called hypereuctectoid steels . These in structure are shown in the series of microphotographs in Figure 4 . The first figure shows pure iron or ferrite . As the carbon content increases to 0.79% carbon , the dark areas of the pearlite form and increase in size while the white background area of ferrite decreases . At 0.79% carbon the sample is all pearlite . In the sample containing 1.410 ; , carbon the pearlite area is smaller and the white background area is now cementite . These iron ? carbon alloys have all been cooled slowly to produce the constituents just described . Hardening Hardening is the process of heating a piece of steel to a temperature within or above its critical range and then cooling it rapidly . if the carbon content of the steel is known , the proper temperature to which the steel should he heated may be obtained by reference to Figure 1 , the iron ? carbon diagram . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little preliminary experimentation ntay be necessary to deterntine the range . A good procedure to follow is to heat and quench a number of small specimens of the steel at various temperatures and observe the results , either by hardness testing or by microscopic examination . When the correct temperature is obtained , there will be a marked change in hardness and other properties . In any heat-treating operation the rate of heating is important . Heat flows from the exterior to the interior of steel at a definite maximum rate . If the steel is heated too fast , the outside becomes hotter than the interior , and uniform structure can not be obtained . If a piece is irregular in shape , a slow rate is all the more essential to eliminate warping and cracking . The heavier the section , the longer must be the heating time to achieve uniform results . Even alter the correct temperature has been reached , the piece should be held at that temperature for a sufficient period of time to permit its thickest section to attain a uniform temperature . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , the carbon content , and the work size . In alloy steels the kind and amount of alloying element also have an influence on the hardness . A very rapid quench is necessary to harden low- and medium-carbon steels . Quenching in a bath ofd water is considered to be rapid cooling and is connuon pmaclice for low- and mcditnn-c:uhon steels . For // high-carbon and alloy steel , oil is generally used as the quenching medium , because its action is not so severe as that of water . Various commercial oils , such as mineral oil , have different cooling speeds and , consequently , impart different harcbuesses to steel on quenching . For extreme cooling , brine or water spray is most effective . Certain alloys can he hardened by air cooling , but for ordinary steels such a cooling rate is too slow to give an appreciable hardening effect . Large parts are usually quenched in an oil bath . This quenching medium has the advantage of cooling the part down to ordinary temperatures rapidly and yet is not too severe . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept uniform to achieve uniform results . Any quenching bath used in production work should be provided with means for cooling . Steel with low carbon content will not respond appreciably to hardening treatments . The predominating constituent of such steel is ferrite , which is soft and not changed by the treatment . As the carbon content increases up to the eutectoid point , the ability of the steel to be hardened also increases . Above this point the hardness can be increased only slightly , because steels above the eutectoid point are made up entirely of pearlite and cementite in the annealed state . Peatlite responds best to heat-treating operations ; any steel composed mostly of this constituent can he transformed into a hard steel . As the size of parts to be hardened increases , the surface hardness decreases , even though all other conditions have remained the same . This is evident if it is remembered that there is a limit to the rate of heat flow through steel . No matter how cool the quenching medium may be , if the heat in the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical rate , there is a definite limit to the hardness that may be obtained . For similar reasons it is evident that the inside of a piece of steel would be softer than the outside . Alloys make it possible to harden small pieces uniformly from the outside to the interior . Also , much greater surface hardness is obtained on alloy steel than on similar sizes of carbon steel . Finally , alloy steel has greater hardenability ; that is , it will harden at a slower cooling rate than carbon steel . Therefore , it may be quenched in oil instead of water . Constituents of hardened steel . It has been previously stated that austenite is a solid solution of iron carbide in gamma iron . All carbon steels are composed entirely of this substance above the upper ( Ac. ) critical point . The appearance of austenite under the microscope is shown in Figure 5 at a magnification of 100 . Extreme quenching of a steel frown a high temperature will preserve sonic of the austenite at // ordinary temperatures . This constituent is about one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c , operties and is nonmagnetic . If a hypocutectoid steel is cooled down slowly , the austenite is tntnslormed into ferrite and pearlitc . Steel having these constituents is soft and ductile . Faster cooling will result in a different constituent , and the steel will be harder and less ductile . A rapid cooling , as a water quench , will result in a martensitic structure , which is the hardest structure that can be obtained . Cementite , although some-what harder , is not present in its free state except in hypereutectoid steels and then only in such small quantities that its influence on the hardness of the steel can be ignored . The essential constituent of any hardened steel is martensite . A. Martens , a German scientist , first recognized this constituent about 1878 . Martensite is obtained by rapid quenching of carbon steels and is the transitional substance loaned by the rapid decomposition of austenite . It is a mixture of very small crystals of alpha iron with carbon , which is probably in the form of cementite . Under the microscope it appears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . The hardness of martensite depends on the amount of carbide present and varies from Rockwell C45 to C67 . It can not be machined , is quite brittle , and is strongly magnetic . If steel is quenched at a rate slightly less than the critical rate , a // dark constituent with somewhat rounded outlines will be obtained . The name of this constituent is fine peat tile . Under the microscope at usual magnifications , it appears as a dark unresolved mass , but at very high magnification a fine lamellar structure can be seen . Fine pearlite is less hard than martensite , having a Rockwell C hardness varying irons 34 to lri , but is quite tough and capable of resisting considerable impact . As the quenching rate is still further reduced , the pearlite becomes coarser and is definitely laminated under high magnification at slow rates of cooling . Maximum hardness of steel . The maximum ha dness obtainable in a given piece of steel depends on the carbon content . Although various alloys such as chromium and vanadium increase the rate and depth-hardening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed that of a carbon steel having the same carbon content . This fact is illustrated in the curve shown in Figure 7 , where Rockwell C hardness is plotted against percentage of carbon . This curve shows the maximum hardness that is possible for a given carbon percentage . To obtain maximum hardness , the carbon must be completely in solution in the austenite when quenched . The critical quenching rate , which is the slowest rate of cooling that will result in // 100% martensite , should be used . Finally austenite must not be retained in any appreciable percentages , as it is considerably softer than martensite . The curve in Figure 7 is made up of test points from both alloy and carbon steels , and it may be seen that there is little variation in the results . However , the same quenching rate can not be used for both alloy and carbon steels of the same carbon content . The maximum hardness obtained in any steel represents the hardness of martensite and is approximately Rockwell C65 . Annealing The primary purpose of annealing is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold-worked . This is usually accomplished by heating the steel to a temperature slightly above the critical temperature , holding it there until the temperature of the piece is uniform throughout , and cooling at a slow rate . This process is known as full annealing because it wipes out all trace of previous structure and refines the crystalline structure in addition to softening the metal . Annealing also relieves internal stresses previously set up in the metal and removes gases trapped in the metal during the initial casting . When hardened steel is reheated to above the critical range , the constituents are changed back into austenite , and slow cooling then provides ample time for complete transformation of the austenite into the softer constituents . For the hypoeutec:toid steels these constituents are pearlite and ferrite . It may be noted by referring to the equilibrium diagram that the annealing temperature for hypereutectoid steels is lower , being slightly above the Ai line . There is no reason to heat above the Arm line , as it is at this point that the precipitation of the hard constituent cementite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the lower critical range and slowly cooling . Any free cementite in the steel is unaffected by the treatment . The temperature to which a given steel should be heated in this process depends on its composition , and for carbon steels it can be obtained readily from the pa tial iron ? iron-carbide equilibrium diagram shown in Figure 1 . The heating rate should be consistent with the size and uniformity of sections so that the entire part is brought up to temperature as uniformly as possible . When the annealing temperature has been reached , the steel should be held there until conditions are uniform throughout . This usually takes about 45 minutes for each inch of thickness of the largest section . For maximum softness and ductility , the cooling rate should be very slow . such as allowing the pa is to cool down with the furnace . The // higher the carbon content , the slower must be this rate . Low-carbon steels may be cooled more rapidly . Process annealing practiced in the sheet and wire industry between cold-working operations consists of heating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then cooling slowly . This process is more rapid than the spheroidizing process and results in the usual pearlitic structure . It is similar to the tempering process but will not give so much softness and ductility as a full anneal . Also at the lower heating temperature there is less tendency for the steel to scale or decarbnrize . Normalizing The process of normalizing consists of heating the steel about 100 F above the critical range and cooling in still air to room temperature . This process is principally used with low- and medium-carbon and alloy steels to make the grain structure more uniform , to relieve internal stresses , or because the treatment results in desired physical properties . Most commercial steels are normalized after being rolled or cast . Spheroidizing Spheroidizing is the process of changing the lamellar cementite in peal Ike to a spheroid structure as shown in Figure 8 . If a steel is haled slowly to a temperature just below the critical range and held lion Ior a prolonged period of time , this structure will be obtained . // It may also be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just above and below the Act range . The globular structure obtained by this treatment gives improved machinability to the steel . This treatment is particularly useful for hypereutectoid steels that must be machined . Tempering Steel that has been hardened by rapid quenching is brittle and not suitable for most uses . By tempering or " drawing , " the hardness and brittleness may be reduced to the desired point for service conditions . As these properties are reduced , there is also a decrease in tensile strength and an increase in the ductility and toughness of the steel . The operation consists of the reheating of hardened steel to some temperature below the critical range , followed by any rate of cooling . Although this process softens steel , it differs considerably from annealing in that the process lends itself to close control of the physical properties and in most cases does not soften the steel to the extent that annealing would . Tempering is possible because of the instability of the martensite , the principal constituent of hardened steel . At about 400 F this constituent will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 300 to 100 F do not cause much decrease in hardness and are used principally to relieve internal strains . As the tempering temperatures are increased , the breakdown of the martensite takes place at a faster rate , and at about 600 F the change to a structure called sorbite is very rapid . Although much softer than fine pearlite formed on direct cooling from austenite , sorbite is tough and has considerable resistance to impact . Increasing tempering temperatures to 1200 F causes a further decrease in hardness and increase in toughness . In the process of tempering some consideration should be given to time as well as to temperature . Although most of the softening action occurs in the first few minutes after the temperature is reached , there is some additional reduction in hardness if the temperature is maintained for a prolonged time . Usual practice is to heat the steel to the desired temperature and hold it there only long enough to have it uniformly heated . Interrupted Quenches The conventional method of hardening and tempering steel just described is illustrated by the time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , known as mai t nn peeing , the steel is quenched from the austenite region to a temperature just above that // where martensite starts to form . The steel is held at this temperature for a period of time long enough to enable the surface and the center of the piece being treated to come to the same temperature . When this occurs , the piece is usually cooled in air to room temperature , thus forming martensite . The temperature at which the steel is held varies with the carbon and alloy content , although for steels containing around 0.40% carbon the temperature is 400F . The main purpose of martempering is to minimize distortion , cracking , and internal stresses that result from normal quenching in oil or water . If the steel is quenched from the austenite region to a temperature of 600 to 800 F and the transformation allowed to occur as indicated in Figure 10 , a new constituent , bai/zi.te , is formed . Under the microscope this structure is similar in appearance to martensite , etching somewhat darker . Although the steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ductile than quenched and tempered steel . The steels that respond to this treatment are limited to those containing about 0.60% carbon . Surface Hardening Carburizing . The oldest known method of producing a hard surface on steel is case hardening or carburizing . This process , in brief , is merely heating iron or steel to a red heat in contact with some carbonaceous material . Iron , at temperatures close to and above its critical temperature , has an affinity for carbon . The carbon enters the metal to form a solid solution with iron and converts the outer surface into a high-carbon steel . The steel used for this process is usually a low-carbon steel of about 0.15% carbon , which does not respond appreciably to heat treatment . In the course of the process , the outer layer is converted into a high138 Heat Treatment of Steel carbon steel with a content ranging from 0.9% to 1.2% carbon . By proper heat treatment such steel will have an extremely hard surface on the outside and a soft ductile center . This process is merely one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it possible to obtain different physical properties in a given piece of steel . A steel with varying carbon content , and , consequently , different critical temperatures , requires consideration in the heat-treatment procedure . The case has a much lower critical temperature than the interior . Since there is some grain growth in the steel during the prolonged carburizing treatment , the work should first be heated to the critical temperature of the core and cooled , which refines the core structure . The steel should then he reheated to the critical range of the case and quenched to produce a hard fine structure . A third tempering treatment may be used to reduce strains . Nitriding . Nitriding is somewhat similar to ordinary case hardening , but it uses a different material and treatment to create the hardsurface constituents . In this process the metal is heated to a temperature of around 950 F and held there for a period of time in contact with ammonia gas . Nitrogen from the gas is introduced into the steel , forming very hard nitrides which are finely dispersed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has greater hardening ability with certain elements than with others ; hence , special nitriding alloy steels have been developed . Aluminum in percentages of 1 to 11/2 has proved to be especially suitable in steel , as it combines with the gas to form a very stable and hard constituent . The temperature of heating ranges from 850 to 1200 F , although 960 to 975 F is the temperature range generally used . The nitriding process develops extreme hardness in the surface of steel . This hardness ranges from 900 to 1100 Brinell , which is considerably higher than that obtained by ordinary case hardening . Nitriding steels , by virtue of their alloying content , are stronger than ordinary steels and respond readily to heat treatment . It is recommended that these steels be machined and heat-treated before nitriding , as there is no scale or further work necessary after this process . Fortunately , the structure and properties are not affected appreciably by the nitriding treatment ; and , since no quenching is necessary , there is little tendency to warp , develop cracks , or change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of water , saltwater spray , alkalies , crude oil , and natural gas . This process is used on many automotive , airplane , and Diesel-engine // wearing parts , as well as on numerous miscellaneous parts , such as pump shafts , gages , drawing dies , gears , clutches , and mandrels . Its use is limited by the expense necessary for the treatment and the com paratively thin case obtained ( 0.001 to 0.005 inch ) . Cyaniding . Cyaniding is a process combining the absorption of carbon and nitrogen to obtain surface hardness in low-carbon steels that do not respond to ordinary heat treatment . In this process the part to he case-hardened is immersed in a bath of fused sodium cyanide salts at a temperature of approximately 1600 F , the time of soaking depending on the depth of case desired . The part is then quenched in water or oil to obtain the desired hard surface . Case depths of 0.005 to 0.020 inch may be readily obtained by this process . Disadvantages of this process are the toxicity of the salts used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated . Induction hardening . Metals have been heated and melted by induced electric currents for some time . It is only recently , however , that this means of heating has been employed in surface hardening . This process here described is commonly known as the Tocco process , * and it was developed for the purpose of surface-hardening crankshaft bearings and other similar wearing surfaces . It differs from ordinary case-hardening practice in that the analysis of the surface steel is not changed , the hardening being accomplished by an extremely rapid heating and quenching of the wearing surface which has no effect on the interior core metal . A surface hardness of approximately 58 to 62 Rockwell C is obtained . An inductor block acting as a primary coil of a transformer is placed around , but not touching , the journal to be hardened . A high-frequency current , usually 2000 cycles , is passed through this block , inducing a current in the surface of the bearing . The heating effect is due to induced eddy currents and hysteresis losses in the surface material . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heating effect of these losses is gradually decreased , thereby eliminating any possibility of overheating the steel . The inductor block surrounding the heated surface has water connections and numerous small holes in its inside surface , and , as soon as the steel has been brought up to the proper temperature , it is automatically spray-quenched under pressure . An important feature of this method of hardening is its rapidity of action , since it requires only 5 seconds to heat the steel to a depth of inch . Obviously , this procedure eliminates warping to a great extent and consequently necessitates only a small allowance for grind140 Heat Treatment of Steel ing to the finished size . Medium-carbon steel has proved very satisfactory for parts treated in this manner , and the nature of the process has practically eliminated the necessity of using costly alloy steels . Figure 11 illus-trates the local heating obtained in a hard-ened crankpin bearing which has been induction-hardened . Flame hardening . Flame hardening , like the induction-hardening process , is based on rapid heating and quenching of the wearing surface . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is applied for a sufficient length of time to heat the surface above the critical temperature of the steel . Integral with the flame head are water connections which cool the surface by spraying as soon as the desired temperature is reached . By proper control , the interior surface is not affected by the treatment , the depth of the case being a function of the heating time and flame temperature . Figure 12 shows an etched cross section of a gear tooth and the hardened areas . Several methods are employed in this process . In the stationary // method of spot hardening , both torch and work are stationary , and the effect is local . In progressive hardening the flame and work move with respect to one another , as , for example , in rail hardening . As the flame progresses , the work is immediately quenched behind the flame . Spinning or rapidly rotating circular work may be used , em ploying one or more flames . As soon as the work is brought up to the proper temperature , it is quenched while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work when the heating time is short . Spinning may also be used in connection with a progressive movement of the torch along the side of the work . The following advantages are claimed for this process : Hard surfaces with a ductile backing may be obtained , large pieces may be treated without heating the entire part , the case depth is easily controlled , the surface is free of scale , and the equipment is portable . Grain Size All steel is crystalline in structure , and the size of these crystals or grains has an important effect on the quality of the steel . Molten steel upon cooling starts solidifying at many small centers or nuclei , the atoms in each group orienting themselves in the same direction . The irregular grain boundaries seen under the microscope after polishing and etching are the outlines of each group of atomic cells that have the same orientation . The size of these grains depends on a number of factors , the principal ones being the composition of the steel and the heat treatment it has received . It has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those having a fine grain ; however , they have better machinability and greater depth-hardening power . The fine-grained steels , in addition to being tougher , are more ductile and have less tendency to distort or crack during heat treatment . Control of grain size is possible through regulation of composition in the initial manu facturing procedure , but , after the steel is made , the control is through proper heat treatment . When a piece of low-carbon steel is heated , there is no change in the grain size up to the Aci point . As the temperature increases through the critical range , the ferrite and pearlite are gradually transformed to austenite , and , at the upper critical point Ac , , , the average grain size is a minimum . Further heating of the steel causes an increase in the size of the austenitic grains , which in turn governs the final size of the grains when cooled . Quenching from the Ac ; point would result in a fine-grained structure , whereas slow cooling or quenching from a higher temperature would give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the prior austenitic grain size in the steel at the time of quenching . All steels do not start growing large crystals immediately upon being heated above the upper critical range , and such steels can be heated to some higher Temperature with little change in their structure . A temperature known as a coarsening temperature , is eventually reached , and grain-size increase becomes rapid . This is characteristic of medium-carbon steels , many alloy steels , and steels that have been deoxidized with aluminum . The coarsening temperature is not a fixed temperature and may be changed by prior hot or cold working and heat treatment. * Hot work on steel is started at temperatures well above the critical range with the steel in a plastic state and has the effect of refining the grain structure and eliminating any coarsening effect due to the high temperature . Hot forging or rolling should not continue below the critical temperature . The principal method of determining grain size is by microscopic examination , although it may be roughly estimated by examination of a fracture . For microscopic determination it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sire itt Metals with Special Reference to Crain Growth iii Austeuite , " Tran.sarlions .4.431 , Vol. 22 , no. 10 , 0134. // grain boundaries be clearly outlined by some constituent . Low-carbon steels have ferrite precipitated Iron ) the austenite upon slow cooling , and the outline of these grains can be clearly brought out by polishing and etching . In estimating the former austenitic grain size for low-carbon steels , the area oI the pearlite formed from the remainder of the austenite must also be considered . For medium-carbon steels the former austenitic grain size would be represented roughly by the pearlitic area plus one-hall the surrounding ferrite . Hypereutectoid steels will have the grain boundaries outlined by the cementite that is precipitated . An example of a large-grained steel is shown in the photomicrograph in Figure I3 . This specimen has been heated to an excessively high temperature , resulting in large grain growth and some crystalline separation . Steel that has been " burnt " shows this separation owing to oxidation at the grain boundaries , and such structure can not be remedied by heat treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by remelting. // CHAPTER // Welding is the fusion or uniting of two pieces of metal by means of heat . Many welding processes have been developed which differ widely in the manner in which the heat is applied and in the type of equipment used . Some processes require hammering , rolling , or press-ing to effect the weld ; others bring the metal to a fluid state and require no pressure . Those processes that use pressure require bring-ing the surfaces of the metal to a temperature sufficient that cohesion takes place . This is nearly always a subfusion temperature . How-ever , it the fusion temperature is reached , the molten metal must be confined by surrounding solid metal . No additional weld metal is required in welds of this type . Most welds are made at fusion tern-perature and require the addition of weld metal in some form . In the welding of dissimilar metals , it is often possible to make a satis-factory bond by bringing only one of the metals to a fusion tempera-ture . Welds are also made by casting , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured into the cavity between the two pieces to be joined . In this method the heat in the weld metal must be sufficient to cause it to fuse properly with the parent metal . Soldering is the uniting of two pieces of metal with a different metal , which is applied between the two in a molten state and at a tempera-ture not exceeding 800 F. In this process some alloying with the base metal takes place , and additional strength is obtained by mechani-cal bonding . The usual metals for soldering are low-melting alloys of lead and tin . Brazing is a similar process in which the metal parts are joined by nonferrous metals , such as copper-zinc and silver alloys , having melting points below that of the parent metal but above 800 F. The filler metal is distributed between the joint surfaces by capillary attraction . Soldering is not considered a welding process , but brazing is now considered one. * Temperatures in this process range from 1100 to 1983 F which includes a wide selection of possible filler metals . 145 // Most of the developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War as a result of the demands of industry for more rapid means of fabrication and assembly of metal parts . Welding processes are employed extensively in the manufacture of automobile bodies , aircraft , high-speed railroad cars , machine frames , structural work , tanks , and general machine-repair work . In the oil industry welding is extensively used at refineries and in pipe-line fabrication . During war the largest single use for welding has been in shipbuilding : in peacetime it is the fabrication of metal structures . The competition of welding has also been felt in the casting industry , as many machine parts that were formerly cast are now made up of steel members welded together . Such construction has the advantage of being lighter and stronger than cast iron . Gas cutting has likewise had its influence on forged products . Many parts are now accurately cut from thick steel plates , thus saving the cost of expensive dies . There is hardly an industry today that is not affected in some way by welding and cutting processes . The first welding processes were all limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easily welded and have a wide welding range . As the carbon content increases or as alloying elements are added , the welding range decreases , and good welds become increasingly difficult . However , the development ofd new electrodes and new welding techniques has greatly altered our concept of what is weldable material . Practically all alloy steels can now be welded if proper equipment and materials are used . Cast iron at first presented serious difficulties , because of its low ductility , poor fusion , and tendency to crack on cooling . Most of these difficulties are now overcome by proper methods and the selection of suitable welding materials . Such nonferrous metals as brass , bronze , Monet metal , aluminum , copper , and nickel can all be successfully welded , although special precaution must usually be taken to prevent oxidation . General Conditions for Welding Welding is facilitated if surfaces are cleaned and freed from foreign matter by wire brushing , machining , or sand blasting . Impurities tend to weaken a weld , causing the metal to be either brittle or filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the metals . Tendencies toward oxidation increase with temperature . At the high temperatures used in many welding processes , the oxidation of the weld metal is likely to have serious weakening effects in the weld . In some processes this influence is counteracted by the use of a flux which removes the oxides and permits perfect cohesion of the metals . // In the electric-arc process the flux is coated on the electrodes and , when melted , forms a protective coating of slag over the weld metal , as well as a nonoxidizing atmosphere . In gas welding and forge welding it is usually added in powder form . Other processes eliminate any oxidation tendencies by creating a nonoxidizing atmosphere at the point where the welding is done . Inasmuch as oxidation takes place rapidly at high temperature , speed in welding is important . Some processes are naturally quicker than others , but in any event the work should be done as rapidly as possible . Principal Welding Processes The principal welding processes are listed in Table 4 . Most of these are discussed briefly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six principal types of joints used in most welding processes ( see Figure I ) are butt , lap , edge , corner , plug , and tee . Some of these types , such as butt welds , may be further subdivided , as they vary in form according to the thickness of the material . Joints for // forge welding differ in their manner of preparation and do not resemble those shown in the figure . Lap and butt joints arc the principal types used in resistance welding . in general , resistancewelded joints must be prepared more accurately and must be considerably cleaner than those used in other processes . Both gas and arc welding use the same types of joints . Forge Welding Forge welding was the first form of welding used and for many centuries the only one in general use . Briefly , the process consists of heating the metal in a forge to a plastic condition and then uniting it by pressure . The heating is usually done in a coal- or coke-fired forge , although modern installations frequently employ oil or gas furnaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as all forming and welding is accomplished with a hand sledge . Before the weld is made , the pieces are first formed to correct shape , so that , when they are welded , they will unite at the center first . As they are hammered together from the center to the outside edges , any oxide or foreign particles will be forced out . The process of preparing the metal is known as scarfing . Forge welding is naturally rather slow , and there is considerable danger of an oxide scale forming on the surface . The tendency to oxidize can be counteracted somewhat by using a thick fuel bed and by covering the surfaces with a fluxing material which dissolves the oxides . Many special fluxes have been prepared ; however , borax in combination with sal ammoniac is commonly used . Heating must be slow on account of unequal section thickness . As soon as the desired uniform temperature is reached , the pieces are removed to the anvil and hammered together . For this type of welding , low-carbon steel and wrought iron are recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range decreases rapidly as the carbon content increases . High-carbon steels and alloy steels require considerably more care in controlling temperatures and producing the welds . Large work may be welded in hammer forges driven by air or steam . Such equipment is especially valuable for forming and shaping work in the plastic state and has the additional advantage of refining the grain size when worked above the critical temperature of the metal . Welded steel pipe is made mechanically by running the preheated steel strips through rolls which form the pipe to size and apply the necessary pressure for the weld , as discussed in Chapter 8. // Electrical-Resistance Welding In this process a heavy electric current is passed through the metals to be joined , causing a local heating , and the weld is completed by the application of pressure . This process dates back to the latter part of the 19th century and was first used by Elihu Thompson . When the current passes through the metal , the greatest resistance is at the point of contact ; hence , the greatest heating effect is at the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally used , coming to the machine with the usual commercial voltages . A transformer in the machine reduces the voltage to 4 to 12 volts and raises the amperage sufficiently to produce a good heating current . The amount of current necessary is 30 to 40 kva per square inch of area to be united , based on a time of about 10 seconds . For other time intervals the power varies inversely with the time . The necessary pressure to effect the weld will vary from 4000 to 8000 pounds per square inch . Resistance welding is essentially a production process adapted to the joining of light-gage metals which can be lapped . Usually the equipment is suitable for only one type of job , and the work must be moved to the machine . The process is especially adapted to quantity production , and its use includes a large amount of the welding done at the present time . It is the only process that permits a pressure action at the weld , while allowing an accurately regulated heat application . Also , the operation is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent on its melting point . Practically all metals can be welded by resistance welding , although some few , such as tin , zinc , and lead , can be welded only with great difficulty . In all resistance welding the three factors that must be given consideration are expressed in the formula : Heat = 12RT , where I is the welding current in amperes , R the resistance of the metal being welded , and T the time . The amperage of the secondary or welding current is determined by the transformer . To provide possible variation of the secondary current , the transformer is equipped with a regulator on the primary side to vary the number of turns on the primary coil . This may be seen in Figure 2 . For good welds these three variables , current , resistance , and time , must be carefully considered and determined by such factors as material thickness , kind of material , type and size of electrode . The timing of the welding current is very important . There should be an adjustable delay after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current is then turned on by the timer and held // a sufficient time for the weld . It is then stopped , but the pressure remains until the weld cools , thus eliminating any tendency for the electrodes to arc and also protecting the weld from discoloration . The pressure on the weld may be obtained manually , by mechanical means , by air pressure , by springs , or by hydraulic means . Its application must be controlled and co-ordinated with the application of the welding current . Resistance welding may be subdivided into six separate heads : ( 1 ) Spot welding , ( 2 ) projection welding , ( 3 ) seam welding , ( 4 ) butt welding , ( 5 ) flash welding , and ( 6 ) percussion welding . Spot welding . In this form of resistance welding two or more sheets of metal are held between metal electrodes as shown in Figure 2 . The welding cycle is started with the electrodes contacting the metal under pressure before the current is applied , and for a period known as the squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed between the electrodes causing the metal in contact to be rapidly raised to a welding temperature . As soon as the temperature is reached , the pressure between the electrodes squeezes the metal together and completes the weld . This period , usually 3 to 30 cycles , is known as the weld time . Next , while the pressure is still on , the current is shut off for a period called the hold time , during which the metal regains some strength by cooling . The pressure is then released , and the work is either removed front the machine or moved so that another portion caul be welded . This is the ofi time . All times arc measured in terms of current cycles and usually range from 3 to 60 ( 1 cycle = %o sec ) . Spot welding is probably the simplest form of resistance welding and for ordinary sheet steel does not present much of a problem . However , good welds require sheet steel which is free from scale or Ioreigu substances . Such films cause variations in surface resistance // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the electrodes . Surface imperfections , variations in weld strength , and electrode pickup are defects to be expected if sheet surfaces are not properly prepared . It may be noted that in spot welding there are three zones of heat generation : one at the surface between the two sheets , and the other two at the contact surfaces of the sheets with the electrodes . The center surface reaches a fusing temperature first , since the heat is rapidly conducted from the outside surfaces by the water-cooled electrodes . Machines for spot welding are made in three general types : stationary single-spot , portable single-spot , and multiple-spot machines . Sta-tionary machines may be further classified as rocker-arm and direct-pressure types . The rocker-arm type , shown in Figure 3 , is the simplest and cheapest but is generally limited to machines of small capacity . This machine is so designated because the motion for applying pressure and raising the upper electrode is made by rocking the upper ann . The larger machines usually employ direct straight-line motion of the upper electrode . This arrangement permits them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air-operated machine of this type is shown in Figure 4 . As assemblies to be welded increase in size , it is not always possible to bring them to a machine . Portable spot welders , connected to the transformer by long cables , and capable of being moved to any desired position , are then used . Welding jig assemblies where all welds can not be made by a single machine setup are also served best by portable welders . A wide variety of portable welding guns is made , as indicated in Figure 5 , the principal differences among them being in the manner of applying the pressure and the shape of the tips . Pressure is applied manually , pneumatically , or hydraulically , depending on the size and type of gun . For production work , multiple-spot-welding machines have been developed which are capable of producing two or more spots simul taneously . In machines of this type several direct welds can be made from either one or more.transformers . In some cases a system known as indirect welding is used , where two electrodes are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath the sheets and between the electrodes . Figure 6 shows a high-production welding machine consisting of 16 hydraulically operated guns controlled by air valves . A mechanism actuates groups of four guns ( in series ) through the air valve in rapid sequential welding . The mufflers , made of 0.040-inch galvanized steel , arc welded at the rate of 480 mufflers per hour . This is a special-purpose machine and typical of those designed for multiple-spot-welded production jobs . Gun welding machines normally operate at 100 to // 360 spot welds per minute although speeds up to 720 have been attained . Spot welding lends itself readily to production work because of its simplicity and the rapidity with which welds can be made . Most ferrous and nonferrous alloys may be spot-welded , but each metal requires special manipulation and current regulation . Spot welding has a wide application , from thin foils in which low currents are used to heavy plates requiring high current and long time . Theoretically , any material of reasonable thickness can be spot-welded ; however , as the thickness increases , the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the usual upper limit . Spot welding is widely used in the manufacture of automobiles , refrigerators , and metal toys , and in numerous other metal-stamping assemblies . Projection welding . Projection welding is similar to spot welding and is illustrated in the line diagram shown in Figure 7 . Projection // welds are produced at localized points in work pieces held under pressure between suitable electrodes . Sheet metal to be welded in this manner is first put through a punch press , which presses small projec tions or buttons into the metal . " These projections are made with a diameter on the lace equal to the thickness of the stock and project above the stock about 60% of its thickness . Such projection spots or ridges arc made at all points where a weld is desired . This process is also used for cross-wire welding and for parts where the ridges are produced by machining . One advantage of this form of welding is that a number of welds can be made simultaneously , the only limit to the number being the ability of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current and pressure . Results are generally uniform , and weld appearance is often better than in spot welding . Electrode life is long , since only flat surfaces are used and little maintenance is required . In actual welding the sequence of operation is identical with that of spot welding . The current per weld is slightly less than for spot welds , but , because multiple welds are made , greater current and pressure capacity must be available . Only press-type machines are recommended for this process . It is possible to weld all metals by this method as readily as by other resistance-welding processes . Seam welding . Seam welding , shown in Figure 8 , consists in making a continuous weld or joint on two overlapping pieces of metal . Such welds are made by passing the metal between two electrode rollers or dies which transmit current and to which mechanical pressure is applied . In some cases only a single roller is used in conjunction with a flat track . This method is , in effect , a continuous spot-welding process , as the current is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine . The spots can be spaced close together to // form a continuous scam or can be regulated so that they are several inches apart . The welding time is measured in cycles , and electronictube controls are used to provide current interruptions . To produce a pressure-tight scam requires 5 to 14 spots per inch , depending on the type and gage of the material . This type of welding is limited to thicknesses ranging from 0.010 to 1/a inch . An air-operated rocker-arm-type seam and roll-spot-welding machine is shown in Figure 9 . The maximum pressure obtainable between the electrodes runs as high as 3500 pounds at an air pressure of 90 pounds per square inch . Continuous rotation of the upper wheel can be adjusted up to 6 rpm , or intermittent rotation can be obtained if desired . This machine is capable of producing 858 spot welds per minute on two 0.040-inch thicknesses , which is 66 inches per minute with 13 spots per inch . Other machines are designed with the roller electrodes mounted so that the work is fed into the machine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for producing either circumferential or transverse welds . Seam welding is used a great deal in the manufacture of metal conElectrical-Resistance // tainers , automobile mufflers , stove pipes , refrigerator cabinets , and gasoline tanks . Advantages of this type of fabrication include neater design , saving of material , tight joints , and low cost of construction . Butt welding . This form of welding , illustrated in Figure 10 , consists in gripping together two pieces of metal that have the same cross section and pressing them together while heat is being generated in the contact surface by electrical resistance . Although pressure is maintained while the heating takes place , at no time is the temperature sufficient actually to melt the metal . The joint is upset somewhat by the process , but this defect can be eliminated by subsequent rolling or grinding . Both parts to be welded should be of the same resistance in order to have unifonu heating at the joint . If two dissimilar metals arc to be welded , the metal projecting from the die holders must be in proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same treatment must be used where materials of different cross section are butt-welded . In actual operation , the work is first clamped in the machine and a pressure is applied on the joints . The welding current is then started , and heating takes place ; the rate depending on the pressure , the material , and the condition of surfaces . Since the contact resistance varies inversely with the pressure , the pressure is less at the start and is then increased to whatever is necessary to effect the weld ( 2500 to 8000 pounds per square inch ) when the welding temperature is reached . As soon as the weld is completed , the current is cut off and the work unclamped from the machine . This process differs from flash-butt welding in that there is no flashing or arcing at the joint during the operation . Practically all metals that can be spot- or projection-welded can also 1 ) c butt-welded , with the strength of the weld being about equal to the strength of the metal being welded . This type of welding is // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many other parts of uniform section . Areas up to 70 square inches have been successfully welded , but generally the process is limited to small areas because of current limitations . Figure 11 illustrates a special type of butt-seam welding used in pipe manufacture . Flash welding . Butt and flash-butt welding are similar in their application but differ somewhat in the manner of heating the metal . Figure 12 illustrates diagrammatically the operation of this type of welding machine . The stock is clamped by dies as in ordinary butt welding . As soon as the metal is clamped , the current is turned on , and the two joints are brought together by means of the cam control . As the two parts are lightly contacted , there is vigorous arcing which melts down any unevenness of the surface and rapidly brings it to a plastic state . The operating cam is adjusted so that the upset portion engages the moving platen at the proper time , and the two surfaces are forced together under high pressure ( 5000 to 25,000 pounds per square inch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very heavy current but takes a relatively short time . A small fin or pro jection left at the joint can be easily removed . An important ad-vantage of the flash-welding process is that the plate edges do not have to be specially prepared . Welding of small areas is usually done by the butt-welding method and those of large area by the flash-butt method ; however , there is no clear demarcation between the two . The shape of the piece and the nature of the alloy are frequently the determining factors . Areas ranging from 0.002 to 50 square inches have been successfully welded by flash welding . In this process , less current is required than in ordinary butt welding ; there is less metal to remove around the joints ; the metal that forms the weld is protected from atmospheric con tamination ; the operation consumes little time ; and end-to-end welding of sheets is possible . Because of these advantages , flash welding is more widely used than the ordinary butt or upset process . Many nonGas // ferrous metals can be flash-welded satisfactorily ; however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin , and copper are not recommended for this process . Flash welding is widely used for tubular furniture , rear-axle housings , steel rims , sheets in body manu facture , steel forgings , and rolled sections . Percussion welding . This is a recent development in welding , and , like the flash-weld process , relies on arc effect for heating rather than on the resistance in the metal . Pieces to be welded are held apart , one in a stationary holder and the other in a clamp mounted in a slide and backed up against heavy spring pressure . When the movable clamp is released , it moves rapidly , carrying with it the piece to be welded . When the pieces are about IA , ; inch apart , there is a sudden discharge of electric energy , causing intense arcing over the surfaces and bringing them to a high temperature . The arc is extinguished by the percussion blow of the two parts coining together with sufficient force to effect the weld . The electric energy for the discharge is built up in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored in a capacitor , and the parts to be welded arc heated by the sudden discharge of a heavy cur-rent from the capacitor . The electromagnetic welder uses the energy discharge caused by the collapsing of the magnetic field linking the primary and secondary windings of a transformer or other inductive device . In either case intense arcing is created , which is followed by a quick blow to make the weld . The action of this process is so rapid ( about 0.1 second ) that there is little heating effect in the material adjacent to the weld . Heat-treated parts may be welded without being annealed . Parts differing in thermal conductivity and mass can be successfully joined , as the heat is concentrated only at the two surfaces . Some applications are welding Stellite tips to tools , copper to aluminum or stainless steel , silver contact tips to copper , cast iron to steel , lead-in wires on electric lamps , and zinc to steel . Butt welds are made without any upset or flash at the joint . The principal limitation of the process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of nearly regular sections can be welded . Thin sheets of equivalent area can not be joined by this process . The equipment is expensive , since it must be extremely rugged , provided with accurate holding fixtures , and equipped with elaborate electric timing devices and large transformer capacity . Gas Welding Gas welding includes all the processes in which gases are used in combination to obtain a hot flame . Those commonly used are // acetylene , natural gas , and hydrogen in combination with oxygen . Oxyhydrogen welding was the first gas process to be commercially developed . ' The maximum temperature developed by this process is 3600 F. The most-used combination is the oxyacetylene process , which has a flame temperature of 6300 F. Oxyacetylene welding . An oxyacetylene weld is produced by heat-ing with a flame obtained from the combustion of oxygen and acetylene and with or without the use of a filler metal . In most cases the joint is heated to a state of fusion , and no pressure is used ; however , in some cases pressure may be applied . Oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Electrolysis separates water into hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it . Most of the commercial oxygen is made by liquefying air and separating the oxygen from the nitrogen . It is stored in steel cylinders , as shown in Figure 13 , at a pressure of 2000 pounds per square inch . Hydrogen is produced either by the electrolysis of water or by passing steam over coke . Acetylene gas ( C 0H2 ) is obtained by dropping lumps of calcium carbide in water . The gas bubbles up through the water , and the // remainder of the calcium carbide is converted into slaked lime . The reaction that takes lace in an acetlene enerator is The calcium carbide used for making this gas is a hard gray stonelike material formed by smelting calcium with coal in an electric furnace . This material is crushed , sized , and stored in air-tight steel drums before its use . Acetylene gas can be either obtained from acetylene generators , which generate the gas by mixing the carbide with the water , or purchased in cylinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely stored at pressure much over 15 pounds per square inch , it is stored in combination with acetone . Acetylene cylinders are filled with a porous filler saturated with acetone in which the acetylene gas can be compressed . These cylinders hold 300 cubic feet of gas at pressures up to 250 pounds per square inch . A cross section of a typical welding torch is shown in Figure 14A . It consists of a series of brass tubes through which and into which the gases are conducted and finally mixed , valves for controlling the volumes of acetylene and oxygen , and a copper tip from which the gas mixture is burned . Regulation of the proportion of the two gases is of extreme importance , as the characteristics of the flame may be varied . Three types of flame that can be obtained are reducing , neutral , and oxidizing . Of the three , the neutral flame has the widest application in welding and cutting operations . This flame occurs with approximately a one-to-one mixture of oxygen and acetylene . There are two sharply defined zones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is only faintly luminous and slightly bluish in color . The maximum temperature of 6300 F is obtained at the tip of the inner luminous cone . When there is an excess of acetylene used , there is a decided change in the appearance of the flame . In this flame there will be found three zones instead of the two just described . Between the luminous cone and the outer envelope there is an intermediate cone of whitish color , the length of which is determined by the amount of the excess acetylene . This flame , known as a reducing or carbonizing flame , is used in the welding of Monel metal , nickel , certain alloy steels , and many of the nonferrous , hard-surfacing materials , such as StelIite and Colin anoy . If the torch is adjusted to give excess oxygen , a flame similar in tii t ; mue to the neutral flame is obtained , except that the inner Welding and Allied Processes much shorter , and the outer envelope appears to This , the oxidizing flame , may be used in fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and uses of oxyacetylene welding are numerous . cessary for welding is comparatively inexpensive maintenance . It is portable and can be used with in the field and in the factory . With proper lly all metals may be welded . There is also the at the equipment can be used for cutting as well ) rocess is especially adapted to the welding of sheet claming , and to the application of many hard-facing Wing . Since oxyhydrogen burns at a much lower F ) than oxygen and acetylene , it is used primarily ' sects and low-melting alloys and in some brazing quipment can be used for both processes ; however , arc more difficult in hydrogen welding , as there is color to judge the gas proportions .

In pressure gas welding , welds are produced ig areas of parts to he joined with oxyacetylene g temperature ( around 2200 F ) , followed by the sure . It is a butt-welding process and similar to xi except that heat is applied by a gas flame instead tance . Two methods are in common use . In the closed-joint method , the surfaces to be joined are r pressure ( luring the heating period . Multiflame s , designed to go completely around the joint , are on . During the heating operation the torches are ack and forth to eliminate excessive local heating . tresses , the ends , which are prepared with a slight id , when the correct temperature is reached , an g pressure is applied . For low-carbon steel the low 1500 pounds per squ.ne inch and the upsetting // pressure around 4000 pounds per square inch . Pressures , however , vary with the material and for high-carbon steel and many alloys a constant pressure is applied throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flat multiflanie torch which is placed between the two surfaces to be joined . This torch uniformly heats these surfaces until there is a film of molten metal over each of them . The torch is then quickly withdrawn and the two surfaces are forced together and held under pressure ( around 4000 pounds per square inch ) until solidification takes place . The appearance of this joint is similar to that obtained by flash welding , whereas the closed-joint method produces a joint with a bulging appearance . This process is successfully used in the welding of rods , tubes , railroad rails , and pipe lines . Dissimilar metals can be joined , such as high-speed steel to carbon shanks in the manufacture of certain tools . No filler metal is used , and the quality of the weld is determined by the properties of the metal being joined . Oxyacetylene torch cutting . The cutting of steel with a flamecutting torch has developed into a very important production process . A simple hand torch for flame cutting is shown in Figure 14B . It differs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preheating flames surrounding a central hole through which pure oxygen passes . The preheating flames are exactly like the welding flames and are intended only to preheat the steel before the cutting operation . The principle on which flame cutting operates is that oxygen has an affinity for iron and steel . At ordinary temperatures this action is slow , but eventually an oxide in the form of rust materializes . As the temperature of the steel is increased , this action becomes much more rapid . If the steel is heated to a red color and a jet of pure oxygen is blown on the surface , the action is almost instantaneous , and the steel is actually burned into an iron oxide slaglike appearance . About 1.3 cubic feet of oxygen is required to burn up 1 cubic inch of iron . This action is illustrated in Figure 15 where a square steel billet is being cut with a portable machine . In the operation shown , the blowpipe starts and finishes at an angle , while a constant clearance is maintained at all times between the cutting nozzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Figure 16 in preparing plate edges for welding fabrication . Cuts in several planes can be made simultaneously , with accuracy comparable to preparation by machine tools , but at less cost . Metal plates up to 30 inches thickness can be cut by this process . Many cutting machines have been developed that automatically control the movement of the torch to cut any desired shape . Such a // machine is shown in Figure 17 cutting four parts simultaneously . Motion is transferred from the tracing unit to the blowpipe by means of two carriages . The lower carriage runs on rails along the edges of the tracing table , while the upper carriage moves on rails above the lower carriage and provides the transverse movement . Electrically driven , the drive unit automatically controls the movement of the machine at a proper cutting speed in accordance with the template shape . Another example of multiple cutting is shown in Figure 18 where four tank sprockets are cut simultaneously . This machine operates on the pantograph principle so that one or several cutting torches are made to conform exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a hand guide , or a spindle roller which is held against the templet by the operator . Most cutting torches use acetylene in combination with oxygen to provide the necessary flame for preheating . This is not essential , however , as hydrogen , natural gas , or propane can be used if desired . ti // Hydrogen gas is recommended for underwater cutting , while the others are often used because of lower cost . Many parts that previously required shaping by forging or casting are now cut to shape by this process . Flame-cutting machines , re-placing many machining operations where accuracy is not paramount , are widely used in the shipbuilding industry , structural fabrication , // maintenance work , and the production of numerous items made from steel sheets and plates . Cast iron , nonferrous alloys , and high-manganese alloys are not readily cut by this process . Flame machining. * Flame machining is the term used to describe the operation of removing metal with a cutting blowpipe . It differs from ordinary flame cutting in that it does not sever the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in machining operations . The torch is held at a small angle to the work surface and , as it pro-gresses , cuts out a groove instead of penetrating . The process is rapid and requires no power , and the work setup need not be rigid . On the other hand , the surface finish is not good and close dimensional accuracy can not be attained . However , for many rough machining // operations involving the removal of a large amount of metal , this method of cutting should be considered . Arc Welding Arc welding is a welding process in which coalescence is obtained by heat produced from an electric arc between the work and an electrode . The electrode or filler metal is heated to a liquid state and deposited into the joint to make the weld . Contact is first made between the electrode and the work to create an electric circuit , and then , by separating the conductors , an arc is formed . The electric energy is converted into intense heat in the arc , which attains a temperature of over 7000 F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc welding , direct current being preferred for most purposes . A d-c welder ( see Figure 19 ) is simply a motor-generator set of constantenergy type ( constant potential may also be used ) , having the necessary characteristics to produce a stable arc . There should not be too great a current surge when the short circuit is made , and the machine should compensate to some extent for varying lengths of the arc . D-c machines are built in capacities up to 600 amperes having an opencircuit voltage of 40 to 95 volts . A 200-ampere machine has a rated current range of 40 to 250 amperes , according to the standard of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association . While welding is going on , the closed-circuit voltage is 18 to 25 volts . In straight polarity the electrode is the negative terminal , whereas in reverse polarity the electrode is the positive terminal . Carbon-electrode welding . The first methods of arc welding employed only carbon electrodes ; however , this type of welding is still in use to some extent for both manual and machine operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat , and the torch is handled in a fashion similar to the way it is in gas welding . Filler rods supply weld metal if additional metal is necessary . The twincarbon-arc method was one of the first used , the arc being between the two electrodes and not with the work . In operation the arc is held 1/4 to % inch above the work , and best results are obtained with the work in a flat position . The use of this method is limited to brazing and soldering . A second process , utilizing a single carbon electrode of negative polarity , is considerably simpler . In this case the arc is created between the carbon electrode and the work , and any weld metal needed is supplied by a separate rod . Such an arc : is easy to start , as there is no tendency for the electrode to stick to the metal . Straight polarity // must always be used , as a carbon arc is unstable when held on the positive terminal . Most carbon-arc welding of this type is done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and current , rate of travel , and rate of feeding the filler rod are all properly controlled . Since a carbon arc is easily affected by magnetic fields , a separate magnetic field is built into the electrode holder to stabilize the arc and control its direction . Protection of the metal can be obtained by introducing either inert gases or slag-forming fluxes into the arc . Carbon-arc welding is used for welding cast iron , steel , copper , bronze , galvanized iron , and aluminum . It may also be used effectively for rough cutting of metals . Metal-electrode welding . Shortly alter the development of carbonelectrode welding , it was discovered that , by the use of a metal electrode with the proper current characteristics , the electrode itself could be melted down to supply the necessary weld metal . A basic patent for this process was issued to Charles Coffin in 1889 , and it is this process that is in general use today . In actual operation , an arc is started by striking the work with an electrode and quickly withdrawing it a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense heat , most of it is transferred across the arc in the form of small globules to a molten pool . A small amount is lost by being vaporized , and some globules are deposited alongside of the weld as spatter . The arc is maintained by uniformly moving the electrode toward the work at a rate that compensates for that portion of it which has been melted and transferred to the weld . At the same time the electrode is gradually moved along the joint being welded . For ordinary welding there is little difference in the quality of the welds made by a-c and d-c equipment . The a-c machines consist principally of static transformers which are simple pieces of equipment having no moving parts . Their efficiency is high , their loss at no load is negligible , and their maintenance and initial costs are low . Welders of this type are built in six sizes specified by NEMA , and are rated at 150 , 200 , 300 , 500 , 750 , and 1000 amperes . For welding requiring 750 amperes or higher , a-c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic flare of the arc or " arc blow " with a-c than with the d-c equipment is important in the welding of heavy plates or fillet welding . For jobs requiring medium- or small-amperage current loads the a-c equipment is limited by the type of electrodes required . Most of the nonferrous metals and many of the alloys can not be welded with a-c equipment , because electrodes have not been developed for this purpose . // If we compare a-c and d-c welders , the welding speed , the quality of the welds , and the ease in welding are the same . However , d-c machines are still to be preferred , as this type of machine permits the selection of the proper polarity for the welding electrode . Because the alternating current is continually reversing with every cycle , the correct polarity is being used only half the time . This eliminates the successful use of carbon electrodes and many of the metal electrodes . Also , a-c welders operate at slightly higher voltages , and hence the danger of shock to the operator is increased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing demand for the a-c type of welder in fabrication and maintenance shops , sheet-metal work , and jobbing machine shops . Much metal electrode welding is now being done by machine or automatic units . Such welding is essentially the same as manual welding , except that machine units are supplied with controls that feed the wire as it is consumed and move either the welding head or work along at a proper welding rate . The rate of feed is controlled by the voltage of the arc , which varies as its length changes . Automatic welding heads are available for both bare and coated electrodes. // Prerequisites ' * for economic machine welding are ( 1 ) a sufficient volume of production to justify expensive equipment and ( 2 ) a uniform product . Assemblies must fit together readily , and each piece must be of the same size and similar in contour . Often jigs and handling devices are necessary to position the work . If these conditions are fulfilled , machine welding will be economical . The use of automatic-welding machines results in increased welding speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operator is relieved of tedious work , since he does not have to maintain the proper arc length and travel speed . A thyratron-controlled automatic arc-welding unit is illustrated in Figure 20 . Either alternating or direct current , up to 600 amperes , can be used as the source of power for this unit . When welding is going on , the coiled-wire electrode is fed by means of rollers which are controlled to keep the arc voltage at its preset value . Automatic units of this general type are widely used in production welding of both straight and circumferential seams . Electrodes . The three types of metal electrodes ( or " rods " ) are bare , fluxed , and heavy coated . Bare electrodes have a limited use for the welding of wrought iron and mild steel . Straight polarity is generally recommended . Improved welds may be made by applying a light coating of flux on the rods by a dusting or washing process . The flux assists both in eliminating undesirable oxides and in pre-venting their formation . However , the heavily coated arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all types of commercial welding . Over 95% of the total manual welding that is being done today is with coated electrodes . Figure 21 is a diagrammatic sketch showing the action of an arc using a heavy-coated electrode . In the ordinary arc with bare wire // the metal is affected to some extent by the oxygen and nitrogen in the air . This causes oxides and nitrides to be formed in the weld metal , both of which are undesirable . The effect of heavy coatings on electrodes is to provide a gas shield around the arc to eliminate such conditions and also to cover the weld metal with a protective slag coating which prevents oxidation of the surface metal during cooling . Welds made from rods of this type have superior physical characteristics . Manufacturers ' recommendations should always be followed in the selection of an electrode for a given job . Electrode coatings . Electrodes coated with slagging or fluxing materials are particularly necessary in the welding of alloys and nonferrous metals . Some of the elements in these alloys are not very stable and are lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also permit the use of larger welding rods , higher current , and greater welding speeds . In summary , the coatings do the following things : 1 . Provide a protecting atmosphere . 2 . Provide slag of suitable characteristics to protect the molten metal . 3 . Facilitate overhead and position welding . 4 . Stabilize the arc . 5 . Add alloying elements to the weld metal . 6 . Perform metallurgical refining operations . 7 . Reduce spatter of weld metal . 8 . Increase deposition efficiency . 9 . Remove oxides and impurities. 10 . Influence the depth of arc penetration . 11 . Influence the shape of the bead . 12 . Slow down the cooling rate of the weld . These functions are not common to all coated electrodes , since the coating put on a given electrode is largely determined by the kind of welding it has to perform . It is interesting to note that the coating composition is also a determining factor in electrode polarity . By varying the coating , rods may be used with either the positive or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative . Properly coated electrodes make possible a weld metal having physical properties equal with the base metal . Many coating compositions have been developed to accomplish these results . In general , they may be classified as organic and inorganic coatings , although in some cases both types might be used . Inorganic coatings can be further subdivided into flux compounds // and slag-forming compounds . These are some of the principal constituents used : 1 . Slag-forming constituents : SiO2 , MnO2 , and FeO . Al20 ; is sometimes used , but it makes the arc less stable . 2 . Constituents to improve arc characteristics : Na2O , CaO , MgO , and TiO2. 3 . Deoxidizing constituents : graphite and wood flour . 4 . Binding material : sodium silicate and asbestos . 5 . Alloying constituents to improve strength of weld : V , U , Ce , Co , Mo , Al , and Zr . Impregnated-tape metal-arc welding . This form of welding utilizes a tape impregnated with materials that have a shielding effect on the arc when they are consumed , similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This procedure is used only in automatic machine welding , in which case the tape is wrapped around the bare wire just ahead of the arc . Excellent welds are made in this fashion and are of a quality equal to those obtained when a heavycoated rod is used . Atomic-hydrogen arc welding . In this process a single-phase a-c arc is maintained between two tungsten electrodes , and hydrogen is introduced into the ale as shown in Figure 22 . As the hydrogen eutcrs // the arc , the molecules are broken up into atoms which recombine into molecules of hydrogen outside the arc . This reaction is accompanied by the liberation of an intense heat , attaining a temperature of about 11,000 F. Weld metal may be added to the joint in the form of welding rod , the operation being very similar to the oxyacetylene process . The atomic-hydrogen process differs from other arc-welding processes in that the arc is formed between two electrodes rather than between one electrode and the work . This makes the electrode a rather mobile tool , as it can be moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units , as shown in Figure 23 , are used on production jobs that do not require the addition of filler rod . A thyratron panel provides control of the arc , thus regulating the heat output and length of arc that burns between the two tungsten electrodes . Provision is also made to offset the electrodes so that the flat fan-shaped arc is iii line with the scam being welded . Automatic welding is rapid and particularly useful for applications having long straight or eircunlferential seams . // The outstanding advantage of this process over others is its ability to provide high heat concentrations . In addition , the hydrogen also acts as a shield and protects the electrodes and molten metal from oxidation . Metal of the same analysis as the metal being welded can be used with both manual and automatic equipment , and many alloys , difficult to weld by other processes , can be successfully treated . ' The welds are clean , smooth , and free from scale , and they respond to heat treatment in the same way as the parent metal when weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has wide use in die repair ; it successfully welds heat-resisting alloys ; it has proved to be an excellent means of applying carbides and many other hardsurfacing alloys ; and it is widely used in production work where special ferrous and nonferrous alloys are used . Inert-gas-shielded arc welding . In this process , coalescence is pro duced by heat from an arc between a metal electrode and the work which is shielded by an atmosphere of either argon or helium . Two methods of welding are employed : one using a tungsten electrode with filler metal added as in gas welding , and the other using consumable metal wire as the electrode . Both methods are adaptable to either manual or automatic machine welding , and no flux or wire coating is required for protection of the weld . A hand torch using a tungsten electrode is shown in Figure 24 . This torch is water-cooled and constructed with a gas nozzle surround ing the tungsten electrode so that the gas , as it leaves the nozzle , completely envelops the tip of the electrode and the work beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the selection being determined by the kind of metal to be welded . Direct current with straight polarity is required for welding copper alloys and stainless steel , whereas reverse polarity is used for magnesium . Alternating current is more versatile in its application and is used for steel , cast iron , and aluminum , as well as those metals mentioned above . t // The process using a consumable metal electrode is quite recent and differs considerably in operation from the previous method . Figure 25 shows the equipment required for manual welding which includes the welding gun and carriage containing the wire reel , feed motor , and control . In addition , a d-c generator is used as a source of current supply . Bare wire is fed through the gun at a rate controlled by the arc voltage and is consumed in the same fashion as electrodes in ordinary arc welding . A high-density current is supplied permitting wire feeds of 100 to 300 inches per minute . This process has the characteristic of an automatic process and can be used manually in all welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most other metals can be welded by it as well . An interesting application of inert-gas arc welding is the making of spot welds by an argon-shielded electric arc using a tungsten electrode . To effect a weld , a special welding gun with pistol grip is held tightly against the work to be welded . As the trigger is released , the argon valve is opened , and the current is allowed to pass through the electrode for a preset interval ( 1 to 2 sec ) , and then both are shut off . The main advantage of this equipment is its ability to make shot welds on thin sheets from one side of the work only . It is // also useful in spot welding large or irregular-shaped assemblies that are difficult to spot-weld with resistance equipment . Submerged-arc welding . This process is so named because th metal arc is shielded by a blanket of granular fusible flux dining th welding operation . Aside from this lcautrc , its operation is quit // similar to other automatic arc-welding methods . In operation , a bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , as shown in Figure 26 . This material is laid down along the seam to be welded , and the entire welding action takes place beneath it . The arc is started either by striking beneath the flux on the work or by initially placing some conductive medium such as steel wool beneath the electrode . The intense heat of the arc immediately produces a pool of molten metal in the joint and at the same time melts a portion of the granular flux . This material floats on top of the molten metal forming a blanket which eliminates spatter losses and protects the welded joint from oxidation . Upon cooling , the fused slag solidifies and is easily removed ? granular material not fused is recycled and used again . This process is limited to flat welding although welds can be made on a slight slope or on circumferential joints . It is advisable to use a backing strip of steel , copper , or some refractory material on the joint to avoid losing some of the molten metal . The process uses high currents , 300 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and welding speeds . Deep penetration is obtained , and most commercial thicknesses of plate metal can be welded with one pass . As a result , thin plates can be welded without any preparation , whereas only a small vee is required on most others . Most submergedarc welding is done on low-carbon and alloy steels , but it may also be used on many of the nonferrous metals . Stud arc welding . Stud welding is a d-c arc-welding process developed to end-weld metal studs to flat surfaces . It is accomplished with a pistol-shaped welding gun which holds the stud or fastener to be welded . When the trigger of the gun is pressed , the stud is lifted to create an arc and then forced against the molten pool by a backing spring . The entire operation is controlled by a timer which is preset according to the size of the stud being welded . Shielding of the arc is usually accomplished by surrounding it with a ceramic ferrule . This ferrule also confines the metal to the weld area and protects the operator from the arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in many industrial applications involving the use of metal fasteners . Thermit Welding Thermit welding is the only welding process employing an exothermal chemical reaction for the purpose of developing a high temperature and is based on the fact that aluminum has a great affinity for oxygen and call be used as a reducing agent for many oxides . The // // usual Thermit mixture or compound consists of finely divided aluminum and iron oxide , mixed at a ratio of about 1 to 3 by weight . The iron oxide is usually in the form of roll mill scale . This mixture is not explosive and can be ignited only at a temperature of about 2800 F. A special ignition powder is used to start the reaction . The chemical reaction requires only about 30 seconds and attains a temperature of around 4500 F. The mixture reacts according to the chemical equation : 8A1 + 3Fe3O4 = 9Fe + 4Al2O3 The resultant products are a highly purified iron ( actually steel ) and an aluminum oxide slag , which floats on top and is not used . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alloyed with manganese , nickel , or other elements . Figure 27 illustrates the method of preparing the material for such a weld . Around the break where the weld is to be made , a wax pattern of the weld is built up . Refractory sand is packed around the joint , and necessary provision is made for riser and gates . A preheating flame is used to melt and burn out the wax , to dry the mold , and to bring the joints to a red heat . The reaction is then started in the crucible , and , when it is complete , the metal is tapped and allowed to flow into the mold . As the weld-metal temperature is approximately twice the melting temperature of steel , it readily fuses in the joint . Such welds are sound , because the metal solidifies from the inside toward the outside , and all air is excluded from around the mold . In Thermit pressure welds , the ends of joints to be welded are pressed tightly together , and a mold is built around a joint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to form a glasslike surface around the joint , and then the superheated metal is added . When the heat from the slag and metal bring the joint up to welding temperature , the weld is made by pressure , similar to the procedure followed in resistance butt welding . There is no limit to the size of welds that can be made by Thermit welding . It is used primarily for the repairs of large parts which would be difficult or uneconomical to weld by other processes . Cold-Pressure Welding Cold-pressure welding is a method of joining nonferrous metals by applying pressure and causing the metals to flow in a manner necessary to produce a weld . The type of bond obtained is shown by the micrograph in Figure 28 . Before a weld is made , the surfaces or parts to be joined Hoist be wire-brushed thoroughly at a surface speed of around // 3000 feet per minute . This removes oxide films on the surface which must be eliminated before a weld can be made . Other methods of cleaning seem to be unsatisfactory . In making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip so that the metal can flow away from the weld on both sides . It may be applied either by impact or with a slow squeezing action , both methods being equally effective . Pressure required for aluminum ranges from 25,000 to 35,000 pounds per square inch . Spot welds are rectangular in shape and in terms of gage thick-ness are approximately t x 5t in size . In addition , both ring welds and continuous seam welds can be made . The greatest success of this method of welding has been with aluminum and copper ; however , lead , nickel , zinc , and Monel can also be joined by this method . Brazing and Soldering The processes of brazing and soldering , which unite metals by means of a different metal , are shown in Table 5 . In these processes , joints arc made without pressure , the joining metal merely being introduced into the joint in a liquid state and allowed to solidify . Both these // processes have wide commercial use in the uniting of small assemblies and electrical parts . Brazing . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a liquid state , between the pieces of metal to be joined , and allowed to solidify . The filler metal has a melting temperature of over 800 F , but lower than the melting temperature of the parent metal , and is distributed between the surfaces by capillary attraction . Braze weld ing is similar to ordinary brazing except that the filler metal is not distributed by capillary attraction . In both cases special fluxes are required to remove surface oxide and to give to the filler metal the fluidity necessary to wet the joint surfaces completely . The brazing metals and alloys commonly used are as follows : Copper : melting point 1982 F. Copper alloys : brass and bronze alloys having melting points ranging from 1600 F to 2250 F. Silver alloys : melting temperatures ranging from 1165 to 1550 F.* Aluminum alloys : melting temperatures ranging from 025F to 1785 F.t In the brazing of two pieces of metal , the joint must first be cleaned of all oil , dirt , or oxides , and the pieces properly fitted together with appropriate clearance for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the joint preparation in addition to the flux used during the process . Borax , either alone or in combination with other salts , is commonly used as a flux . According to Table 5 there are four methods used in heating the metal to complete a joint . They are : Dipping the assembled parts in a bath of filler metal or flux . When dipped in a flux bath , which is held at a temperature sufficient to melt the filler metal , the assembly must be held together securely in a jig and the joint preloaded with the brazing alloy . In furnace brazing the assemblies are held in position by jigs and are introduced into a controlled-atmosphere furnace maintained at the proper temperature to melt the brazing metal . These furnaces can be either gas- or electric-heated , and of the batch or continuous type . Torch brazing is similar to oxyacetylene welding . Heat is ap plied locally by an oxyacetylene or oxyhydrogen torch , and the filler // metal , in wire form , is melted into the joint . Flux is applied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat may be applied by resistance , by induction , or by an arc . Of these methods , the first two are most often used because of their speed and accurate temperature control . To facilitate speed in brazing , the filler metal is frequently prepared in the form of rings , washers , rods , or other special shapes , to fit the joint being brazed . This insures having the proper amount of filler metal available for the joint as well as having it placed in the correct position . Joints in brazing may be of the lap , butt , sleeve , or scarf types , or of various shapes obtained by curling , upsetting , or seaming processes . The strength of the joint* is determined principally by the strength of the brazing material used , although other influencing factors are strength of the parent metal , amount of clearance , cleanness of the joint , and method of heating and cooling . Advantages of the brazing process include its ability to effect joints in materials difficult to weld , in dissimilar metals , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process is rapid and results in a neat-appearing joint requiring a minimum of finishing . Brazing is used for the fastening of pipes and fittings , tanks , carbide tips on tools , radiators , heat exchangers , electrical parts , and the repair of castings . Soldering . Soldering differs from brazing in that lower-temperature filler metals ( below 800 F ) are used in the joint . Lead and tin alloys having a melting range of 300 to 700 F are principally used in soldering , and the strength of the joint is determined by the adhesive qualities and the strength of these alloys . Although any heating method used in brazing can be employed in this process , much soldering is done with the common soldering iron which is especially suitable for small parts and light-gage metal . Heat is supplied by the iron , and solder is fed to the joint in the form of wire . Cleaning of the joint surface is equally as important in soldering as in brazing , and a flux is necessary .

Hard Surfacing Hard surfacing is applying to a wearing surface some metal or treatment that renders the surface highly resistant to abrasion . Such processes vary a great deal in their technique .

Sons , 1911 , M38. // surface coating by fusion welding ; in others no material is added , and the surface metal is changed by heat treatment or by contact with other materials . With the development of the processes , many new hardsurfacing materials were discovered . The research for these hard materials has been especially keen during recent years , owing to the great demand of industry for longer-life products . The several properties required of materials subjected to severe wearing conditions are hardness , abrasion resistance , and impact resistance . Hardness is easily determined by several known methods , and an accurate comparison of metals for this property can be obtained readily . Tests for wear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to obtain comparative results . In general , experience has shown that , to obtain proper results , wear testing must simulate the service conditions for each type of hard-facing material . The statement that " the wear resistance of a material is a function of the method by which it is measured " has been confirmed by both practical experience and research . If we consider all the factors involved , hardness is probably the best criterion of wear resistance . Ability to withstand wear and abrasion usually increases as the hardness of the metal increases . Table 6 is a classification of the various processes used for obtaining a hard surface . Obviously , there is a great difference in the hardness that can be obtained from these methods . The classification does not include heat-treating methods which produce a hard interior surface . Where thick coatings of hard materials are required , it is necessary to use some form of welding . The hard-facing materials used as electrodes or filler rods are classified roughly as " overlay " and " diamond-substitute " types . The overlay materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chromium and manganese , and numerous nonferrous alloys containing principally cobalt , manganese , and tungsten . The hardness of these materials varies considerably , ranging from around Rockwell C40 to 70 . According to the Mohs scale , the hardness seldom exceeds 8 . The " diamond substitutes " are such materials as tungsten , boron , tantalum carbides , and chromium boride . These materials are among the hardest available and on the Mohs scale fall between 8.5 and 9.5 . They can not be applied by self-fusion but must be bonded to the parent metal with some lower-melting alloy . High-carbon welding rod with a carbon content ranging from 0.9 to 1.1% is the most economical hard-facing material to apply from the standpoint of initial cost . Such rods form a tough surface of moderate b ; u ( iness , ranging 110111 Rockwell ( : 30 to ' 15 . Hardest surfaces are // obtained by rapid quenching ; and , as with all martensitic deposits , not much additional hardness can be obtained by cold working . Their corrosion resistance is poor , but such coatings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TABLE 6 . METHODS OF PRODUCING HARD SURFACES 1 . Heat treatment A.

Increased hardness and wear resistance can be obtained by alloying steel with such elements as nickel , manganese , molybdenum , and chromium . The limit of hardness for such coatings is around Rock-well C55 , and , since many of the alloys result in austenitic deposits , their hardness can be increased by cold working . Corrosion resistance of most of these materials is good , as well as their resistance to impat , and no heat treatment is required alter applic ; it i ( nt. // In the nonferrous group are included all rods that are made up of elements other than iron , but in some cases small percentages of iron may be present . The principal elements in this group are tungsten , chromium , molybdenum , and cobalt . The average room-temperature hardness of this group is about the same as that of the ferrous-alloy group . A high percentage of this hardness is retained while the rods are at red heat , which adds greatly to their wear-resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by friction , which acts on the minute areas of particles in contact . The effect of this heat is to soften the metal on these areas and cause them to wear away . However , if the metal in contact can retain a hardness at a relatively high temperature , it has a much greater resistance to wear than metals that do not have this property . In such cases the initial hardness is not a true criterion of the wear-resisting ability of the metal . Both the electric-arc and oxyacetylene processes can be used in applying this material , the latter process being preferred . Better control of the deposit is obtained , and there is less dilution of the rod with the parent metal . There is also no loss of the expensive rod material by volatilization and spattering . Practically any carbon or alloy steel can be hard-surfaced with this material , and it is especially adapted for coating surfaces subject to severe abrasion and impact , such as valve seats and oil-drilling tools . The so-called diamond substitutes constitute the hardest materials that are available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemented carbides , include tungsten carbide , tantalum carbide , titanium carbide , boron carbide , and chromium boride , or a combination of these and other carbides with a suitable cementing agent . In tungsten carbide , which is one of the most common of the group , the usual analysis by percentage is tungsten 81.4% , cobalt 12.7% , carbon 5.3% , and iron 0.6% . The cobalt serves as a binder and adds to the ductility of the carbide . It may vary in percentage from 5 to 13 . Tantalum carbide is 87% TaC , with 13% of some binder . Usually the binder is either a combination of molybdenum and iron or of tungsten carbide and cobalt . Boron carbide contains about 78.2% boron and 21% carbon , with a trace of silicon and iron . It is usually known by the symbol B4C . Many similar carbide materials are manufactured under special trade names , the compositions of which are not generally known and vary with manufacture . Carbide material can not be applied as other hard-surfacing materials because of its high melting temperature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in screen sizes . Inserts can be applu d a braving or sweating-on process or placed in melted or // puddled metal and then surrounded by metal from a steel or hardsurfacing welding rod . Screen sizes of crushed carbide particles can be applied conveniently by putting the particles in steel tubes . The steel sheath melts like an ordinary welding rod and fuses to the metal . The carbide particles do not melt but are distributed through the molten metal and are held fast when the metal cools . Screen sizes can also be applied by mixing the particles with a suitable binder and casting them into rods . These rods can be used conveniently like other hard-surface welding rods . These materials all have hardnesses approaching that of a diamond , and on the Mohs scale they range from 9 to 9.5 . This hardness is maintained to a large extent at a red heat . Because of such extreme hardness and brittleness , diamond substitutes do not have a high strength rating and are not suitable where severe shock and impact conditions exist . This difficulty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough binding material . Another characteristic of these surfacing materials is that they do not respond to heat treatment or cold working and retain their initial hardness under all conditions . They are not suitable for casting , although a few hard materials , principally boron alloys with an iron base , can be processed in this manner . Metal Spraying The spraying of molten metal , a comparatively recent development , is rapidly becoming an important process in industry . Any metal obtainable in wire form can be applied in this manner . The wire is fed into the spray gun at a definite rate , where it is melted by an oxyacetylene flame and then blown by compressed air to the surface being coated . A typical layout of metal-spraying equipment is shown in Figure 29 . Because the bond between the sprayed metal and the parent metal is entirely mechanical , it is important that the surface of the metal be properly prepared before spraying . The usual method of cleaning and preparing the surface is by blasting with sharp silica sand or angular steel grit . Cylindrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface followed by rolling over the tops of these grooves with a tool similar to a knurling tool . Either of these methods roughens the surface and provides the necessary interlocking surfaces or keys to make the plastic metal adhere to the surface . The molten metal is blown with considerable force against the surface , causing it to flatten out and interlock with surface // irregularities and the adjacent metal particles . The sprayed metal itself provides a suitable surface for successive coatings and permits building up a layer of considerable thickness . Obviously there is some change in the physical properties of metal applied in this manner . There is an increase in porosity and a corresponding decrease in the tensile strength of the material . The reason for this is that the bond is mechanical and not fusile , as for welding . The compressive strength is high , and there is some increase in hard ness . Stainless-steel and high-carbon deposits will develop a Sclero scope hardness of 70 to 75 , which corresponds to a Brinell hardness of 500 to 550 . The wearing quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in building up worn shafts and other moving parts . All deposits can be finished satisfactorily by usual machining or grind ing methods . In general , the metals retain most of their original properties . The success of this process is due largely to its economy and the rapidity with which the metal can be applied . There is no distortion in the parts being surfaced , nor are any internal stresses developed . Practically any metal can be applied to any other commercial metal and even to other base surfaces such as wood and glass . // Metal Plating Electroplating has long served as a means of applying decorative and protective coatings on metals . For wear or abrasive resistance , the outstanding metal for plating metallic surfaces is chromium . For this use , coatings are seldom less than 0.002 inch thick and may be considerably more . Coatings of this nature are plated not on a soft base metal but directly onto the hard parent metal . If plated on a soft base metal , as copper or nickel , they would have greater corrosion-resisting power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much less . Hence , any measure of hardness or abrasive resistance is to some extent a function of the metal on which it is plated as well as of the chromium deposit itself . The process , electrolytic , consists in passing an electric current from an anode to a cathode ( the cathode being the object on which the metal is deposited ) through a suitable chromium-carrying electro lytic solution in the presence of a catalyst . The catalyst does not enter into the electrochemical decomposition . A solution of chromic acid with a high degree of saturation is used as the electrolyte . The surfaces must be thoroughly polished and cleaned before operations start ; and , since the rate of deposition is fairly slow , the work must remain in the tanks several hours for heavy plating . Chromium has proved very satisfactory for wear-resisting parts because of its extreme hardness , which exceeds most other commercial metals . According to the Brinell scale , the hardness of plated chromium ranges from 500 to 900 . This wide variation is due not to the metal but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF METALS The mechanical working of metal is the shaping of metal in either the cold or the hot state by some mechanical means . This does not include the shaping of metals by machining or grinding , in which processes metal is actually machined off , nor does it include the casting of molten metal into some form by use of molds . In mechanical working processes , the metal is shaped by pressure ? actually forging , bending , squeezing , drawing , or shearing to its final shape . In these processes the metal may be either cold- or hot-worked . For cold working of steel , normal room temperature is used ; however , tem peratures up to critical are included in this range . Hot working of steel takes place at temperatures above the critical range . At such high temperatures the metal is in a plastic state and is readily formed by pressures . The properties of the metal are actually improved by mechanical working , since grain refinement is caused by the process . Little grain refinement takes place below the critical range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both hot and cold working produce a structure elongated in the same direction as rolling , drawing , or other form of mechanical work . Metals which are cast from the furnace into ingot molds must be reduced to commercial shapes by mechanical force . This force is applied to the metal while it is hot , for the following reasons : to shape the product more easily into some commercial article , to improve the physical properties of the metal , and to impart a fine crystalline structure to the metal . Principal methods of hot-working metals are : 192 // Hot-Working Processes Before metals are mechanically worked , they are first cast into ingot molds of suitable form for subsequent operations . The mold // may be either square or round in cross section , and the final casting may vary in size from a few hundred pounds to several tons . The kind of metal cast and the product desired arc the principal factors in determining the ingot size . The operation of pouring ingot molds with steel from an open-hearth furnace is shown in Figure 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , and then the molds are removed . While still hot , the ingots are placed in gas-fired furnaces called soaking pits , where they remain until they have attained a uniform working temperature throughout and then are taken to the rolling mill . The structure of the steel ingot is very coarse , because the grains grow while the metal is slowly cooling from a liquid to a solid state . This is illustrated in Figure 2 , which shows a longitudinal and cross section of a medium-carbon killed-steel* ingot . The coarse dendritic crystalline structure may be clearly seen in the cross section . This coarse structure will be subsequently eliminated by the effects of hot * . Steel that has been dcoxidired to the extent that gases are evolved Burin ; ' the Inotcss of solidification is known as " killed " steel . // working . The impurities in ingots tend to segregate in the shrink head ( luring the process of solidification . Cutting oft the end of the ingot , either before the rolling starts or shortly alter it has started , largely eliminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in the soaking pit at a temperature around 2200 F for a sufficient time to become uniformly heated , it is then removed by an overhead crane and placed on the rolling-mill table . Because of the large variety of finished shapes to be made , ingots are first rolled into such intermediate shapes as blooms , billets , or slabs . These shapes all have rounded corners and vary principally in cross-sectional area . A bloom has a square cross section with a minimum size of 6 by 6 inches . Figure 3 shows an ingot being rolled in a blooming mill . This mill is a two-high reversing mill , permitting the metal to pass back and forth through the rolls . At frequent intervals it is turned 90 degrees on its side to keep the section uniform and to reline the metal throughout . About 20 passes // are required to reduce a large ingot into a bloom . Grooves are provided in both the upper and lower rolls to accommodate the various reductions in cross-sectional area . A billet is smaller than a bloom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches up to the size of a bloom . Although billets could be rolled to size in a large blooming mill , this is not usually clone for economic reasons . Frequently they are rolled from blooms in a continuous billet mill consisting of about eight rolling stands in a straight line . The steel makes but one pass through the mill and emerges with a final billet size of approximately 2 by 2 inches . The billet is the raw material for many final shapes such as bars , tubes , and forgings . The diagram in Figure 4 illustrates the number of passes and sequence in reducing the cross section of a 4-by-4-inch billet to round bar stock . Slabs may be rolled from either an ingot or a bloom . They have a rectangular cross-sectional area with a minimum width of 10 inches and a minimum thickness of 11 inch . Slabs constitute the material from which plates , skelp , and thin strips are rolled . Various arrangements of rolls used in rolling machines are shown in Figure 5 . Those that have four or more rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing the rolling . In addition , many // special rolling mills take the intermediary products just described and fabricate them into such finished articles as rails , structural shapes , plates , and bars . Such mills usually bear the name of the product being rolled and in appear-ance are similar to mills used for rolling blooms and billets . Hammering or smith forging . This type of forging consists of hammering the heated metal either with hand tools , or be-tween Hat dies in a steam ham-mer . Hand forging as done by the blacksmith is the oldest form of forging . It is largely used in repair or maintenance work and in the production of numerous small parts such as hooks , crow-bars , chisels , cutting tools , U bolts , and similar articles , where only small quantities arc in-volved . Much of this type of work is now done in power forges called steam or smith hammers . Machines of this type have an open-frame construction to allow plenty of room around the flat dies as shown in Fig. 6 . The force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work done is generally for the purpose of reducing the cross section of the metal . // Drop forging . Drop forging differs from smith forging in that closed-impression rather than open-face dies are used . The forging is produced by impact or pressure which compels the plastic metal to conform to the shape of the dies . In this operation there is drastic flow of the metal in the dies caused by the repeated blows on the metal . The ram , operating in a vertical plane , carries one half of the dies and the other half is held stationary on the anvil block . Both are held in perfect alignment . Steps in the forging of a connecting rod are illustrated in Figure 7 . The first step in the manufacture of this part is to shear off bar stock to proper length and bring it up to forging temperature in a furnace adjacent to the forge . The dies used in this operation , shown at A , contain impressions for several operations . Preliminary hot working first proportions the metal for forming the connecting rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces the cross-sectional area of the center while the edging gathers metal for the two ends of the rod . The blocking operation , which forms the rod into a definite shape , is shown at C. The appearance of the connecting rod after several blows in the finishing die is shown at D. Flash around the edges of the finished forging is removed in a separate press by trimmer dies immediately after the finishing operation is completed . The completed connecting rod , ready for heat treatment , is shown at E. At F is a macroetched cross section of a connecting-rod forging , showing the flow lines of the metal and the fiber structure obtained by the hammering action . The two principal types of drop-forging hammers are the steam hammer and the board hammer . In the former the ram and hammer are lifted by steam , and the force of the blow is controlled by throttling the steam . These hammers work rapidly : over 300 blows a minute can be obtained . The capacities of steam hammers range from 500 to 50,000 pounds . Steam hammers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board hammer shown in Figure 7 , except that they have an overhead steam cylinder assembly for supplying the power . In the board drop hammer several hoards are attached to the ram , the lifting of which is accomplished by several friction rollers contacting the boards on both sides , as shown by the line diagram insert in Figure 8 . When the top of the stroke is reached , the rollers are spread apart , allowing the boards and ram to fall by gravity . The force of the blow is dependent on the weight of the ram or head assembly , which seldom exceeds 8000 pounds . A modification of the hoard hammer is now available in which the board has been replaced by a rod and piston . // // // In this machine the hammer is lifted by air or steam , but a gravity dro is used to do the work . A faster lifting speed is obtained with a cor sequent increase in the number of blows per minute , and there is less maintenance required in replacing rods than boards . The drop-forging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal are improved by the severe mechanical working , the operation is rapid , many complicated parts can be forged to shape , a minimum amount of machining is necessary , and internal defects are eliminated . This method of fabrication is adapted to both carbon and alloy steels , wrought iron , copper-base alloys , aluminum alloys , and magnesium alloys . A limitation is the cost of the equipment and dies , which necessitates the making of a large number of parts . Casting or flame cutting may be employed if the advantages by hot working are not a paramount consideration . Press forging . Press forging employs a slow squeezing action in deforming the plastic metal , as contrasted with the rapid-impact blows of a hammer . The squeezing action is carried completely to the center of the part being pressed , thoroughly working the entire section . The size of the forging is no longer a limitation in press-forging work , since large presses up to capacities approaching 18,000 tons are now available . Figure 9 shows a typical hydrauli type press used in this work having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closed-impression dies are used , and on // one stroke of the ram is normally required to perform the forging operation . A close-up view of the bolster plate , dies , and forgings produced in such a press is shown in Figure 10 . The work of pressing the conical-shaped blank ( left ) in the 1300-ton press is accomplished in two operations . The preliminary operation , performed in the dies to the left , compresses the slug ( right ) and roughly forms it to shape ( center ) , so that there is a minimum of flow and abrasion to the finishing dies . Presses of this type are now widely used in the forming of nonferrous metals . In the forging press a greater proportion of the total work put into the machine is transmitted to the metal than in a drop-hammer press . Much of the impact of the drop hammer is absorbed by the machine and foundation . Furthermore , press reduction of metal is faster and the cost of operation is consequently lower . Press forgings are more accurate than drop forgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of irregular and complicated shapes can be more economically forged by drop forging . Machine or upset forging . Upset forging entails gripping a bar of uniform section in dies and applying pressure on the heated end , causing it to be upset or formed to shape . A large machine of this type is shown in Figure 11 . Here rear-axle drive shafts with flanged ends are being forged from round stock . Machines of this type are an // outgrowth of smaller machines designed for heading bolts and making nuts . Dies for these machines consist of two gripper dies , grooved to hold the stock during the various forging operations , and a header or punch // assembly . A die for forging a socket wrench in four operations is shown in Figure 12 . Such dies are not limited to upsetting operations but may also be used for piercing , punching , trimming , extrusion , or bending . Parts forged by this process include axle shafts , pinions , axle housings , valve stems , engine cylinders , worm gears , and numerous other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used in a wide variety of reduced , straight , and taper operations . A typical machine of this type producing automobile rear-axle drive shafts is shown in Figure 13 . The rolls in this machine are semicylindrical in cross section and are grooved according to the type of forging or shaping to be done . When the rolls are in open position , the operator places the heated bar between them , retaining it with tongs . As the rolls revolve , the bar is gripped in the roll grooves and pushed toward the operator . This operation is repeated several times , using other grooves , until the part is completely forged to shape . Gages and guiding grooves assist the operator in accurately placing the stock between the rolls . In this manner axles , gear-shift levers , blanks for eyebolts , and connecting rods , brake levers , aluminum propeller blanks , and leaf springs are forged . In the rolling of wheels , metal tires , and similar items a roll mill of somewhat different construction is used . Figure 14 shows how a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling action of the various rolls about the circumference of the wheel . As the wheel rotates , the diameter is gradually incrcased while the // // plate and rim are reduced in section . When the wheel is rolled to its final diameter , it is then transferred to a press and given a dishing or coning operation . Pipe welding . Pipe and tubular products may be produced by either welding or seamless processes . The butt-welding process uses heated strips of steel , known as skelp , the edges of which are first beveled slightly so they will meet when formed to a circular shape . In the intermittent process , one end of the skelp is trimmed to a V shape to permit it to enter the welding bell shown in Figure 15 . When the skelp is brought up to welding heat , the end is gripped by tongs which engage a draw chain . As the tube is pulled through the welding bell , skelp is formed to a circular shape , and the edges are welded together . A final operation passes the pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to remove all scale . Continuous butt welding of pipe is accomplished by supplying the skelp in coils and providing means for flash-welding the coil ends // together to form a continuous strip . As the skelp enters the furnace , flames impinge on the edges of the strip to bring them to welding temperatures . Leaving the furnace , the skelp enters a series of horizontal and vertical rollers , shown in Figure 16 , which form it into pipe . An enlarged view of the rollers , showing how the pipe is formed and sized , is shown in Figure 17 . As the pipe leaves the rollers , it is sawed into lengths which are finally processed by descaling and finishing operations . Pipe is made in this fashion in sizes up to 3 inches in diameter . Electric butt welding of pipe necessitates cold forming of the steel plate to shape , prior to the welding operation . The circular form is developed by passing the plate through a continuous set of rolls which progressively change its shape . This method , known as roll forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit , placed at the end of the roll-forming machine , consists of three centering and pressure rolls to hold the formed shape in position and two electrode rolls which supply current to generate the heat . Immedi ately after the pipe passes the welding unit , the extruded flash metal is removed from both inside and outside of the pipe . Sizing and finishing rolls then complete the operation by giving the pipe accurate size and concentricity . This process is adapted to the manufacture of pipe up to 16-inch diameter with wall thickness varying from 1/8 inch to I , inch in thickness . Pipes of larger diameter are usually fabricated by fusion welding or by hammer welding , the latter being essentially a forge welding process . // In the lap welding of pipe , the edges of the skelp are beveled as it emerges from the furnace . The skelp then is drawn through a forming die , or between rolls , to give it cylindrical shape , with the edges overlapping . After being reheated , the bent skelp is passed between two grooved rolls as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed mandrel of a size to fit the inside diameter of the pipe , the edges being lap-welded together by pressure between the rolls and the mandrel . Lap weld is made in sizes ranging from 2 to 16 inches in diameter . Piercing . To produce seamless tubing , cylindrical billets of steel are passed between two conical-shaped rolls operating in the same direction . Between these rolls is a fixed point or mandrel which assists in the piercing and controls the size of the hole as the billet is forced over it . The entire operation of making seamless tubing in both the con ventional and the continuous processes is shown in Figure 19 . In the conventional process the solid billet is first center-punched and then brought to forging heat in a furnace before being pierced . The billet is then pushed into the two piercing rolls which impart to it both rotation and axial advance . The alternate squeezing and bulging of the billet open up a seam in its center , the size and shape of which are controlled by the piercing mandrel . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes between grooved rolls over a plug held by a mandrel and is converted into a longer tube with specified wall thickness . While still at working temperatures , the tube passes through the reeling machine which further straightens and sizes it and , in addition , gives the walls a smooth surface . Final sizing and finishing are accomplished in the same manner as for welded pipe . This procedure applies to seamless tubes up to 6 inches in diameter . Larger tubes np to I 1 inches in diameter are given a second operation // on piercing rolls . To produce sizes up to 21 inches in diameter , reheated double-pierced tubes are processed on a rotary rolling mill as shown in Figure 20 and are finally completed by reelers and sizing rolls , as described in the single-piercing process . In the continuous method a 51/2-inch round bar is pierced as before and is then conveyed to the 9-stand mandrel mill where a cylindrical bar or mandrel is inserted into it . These rolls reduce the tube diameter and wall thickness . The mandrel is then removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-stand stretch reducing mill . This mill reduces not only the wall thickness of the hot tube but also the tube diameter . Each successive roll is speeded up so as to produce a tension sufficient to stretch the tube between stands . The maximum de-livery of this mill is 1300 feet per minute for pipe around 2 inches in diameter . Drawing or cupping . Some thick-walled tubes or cylinders are produced by drawing circular heated plates through a die , as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 21 . The entire procedure is made up of several drawing // operations , between each two of which the cup-shaped cylinder must be reheated to provide the necessary plasticity for working . After about two drawing operations , the formed cup is pushed through a horizontal drawbench consisting of several dies of successively decreas ing diameter , mounted in one frank . The hydraulically operated punch forces the heated cylinder through the full length of the drawbench . For long thin-walled cylinders or tubes , repeated heating and drawing may be necessary . II the final product is to be a tube , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent through finishing and sizing rolls , similar to those used in the piercing process . To produce closed-end cylinders , similar to those for storing oxygen , the open end is swaged to form a neck . Extrusion Any plastic material can be extruded to uniform cross-sectional shape by the aid of pressure . The principle of extrusion , similar to the simple act of squirting toothpaste from a tube , has long been utilized in processes raining all the way from the production of brick , hollow tile , and soil pipe , to the manufacture of macaroni . Some // metals , notably lead , tin , and aluminum , may be extruded cold , whereas others require the application of heat to render them plastic or semisolid before extrusion . In the actual operation of extrusion the processes differ slightly , depending on the metal and application , but in brief they consist of forcing metal ( confined to a pressure chamber ) out through specially formed dies . Rods , tubes , molding trim , structural shapes , brass cartridges , and lead-covered cable are typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lead sheathing , as illustrated in Figure 22 , is an important example of hot extrusion . Molten lead is poured into the cylinder above the die and allowed to solidify under slight pressure of the cylinder plunger . When the correct extruding temperature is reached ( around 500 F ) , the plunger , actuated by hydraulic means , forces the lead in two streams around the cable , which weld together underneath . The lead is forced through the die , forming a uniform lead coating which grips the cable sufficiently to draw it through the die block . At the end of the stroke the plunger rises , more lead is added , and the cycle is repeated . An interesting example of extrusion by impact is in the manufacture of collapsible tubes for shaving cream , toothpaste , and paint pigments . These extremely thin tubes are pressed out from slugs , as illustrated in the upper half of Figure 23 . The punch strikes a single blow of considerable force , causing the metal to squirt up around the punch . The outside diameter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , and the thickness is controlled by the clearance between the punch and die . The tube shown in the figure has a flat end , but any desired shape can be made by properly forming the die cavity and the end of the punch . On the upstroke , the tube is blown from the ram with compressed air . The entire operation is automatic , with a production rate of 35 to 40 tubes per minute . The tubes are then inspected , // trimmed , enameled , and printed . Zinc , lead , tin , and aluminum alloys are worked in this fashion . In the lower half of the figure is illustrated a variation of what is known as the Hooker process for extruding small tubes or cartridge cases . Small slugs or blanks are used as in the impact-extrusion process , but in this case the metal is extruded downward through the die opening . The size and shape of the extruded tube are controlled by the space between the punch end and die cavity wall . Copper tubes having wall thicknesses of 0.004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 inches . For the extrusion of large rods , tubes , and special shapes , high-capacity hydraulic presses have been developed similar to the one shown in Figure 24 . Although some nonferrous alloys can be extruded cold , most metals are heated to facilitate the operation . For steel tubing extrusion , a round billet is used which is first heated up to // about 2400 F and then placed in the machine . A mandrel is advanced and pushed through the ingot as shown in the line diagram . The press stern then advances and extrudes the metal through the die at the other end of the billet container . The entire operation must be rapid to prevent the outer surface of billet from cooling . Speeds up to 120 inches per second have been used in making steel tubes . // CHAPTER // MISCELLANEOUS PROCESSES Many of the same operations used in hot working may also be used in cold working , but the effect on the crystalline structure of the metal is different . Hot work , performed on the metal in a plastic state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorts it and does little toward reducing its size . Cold working is nornially done at room temperature ; however , for steel , temperatures up to the critical range may be included . Many products are cold-finished after hot rolling to make them commercially fit for their intended use . For example , hot-rolled strips and sheets are soft , have surface imperfections , and lack dimen sional accuracy and certain desired physical properties . In the cold-rolling operation there is a slight reduction in size which permits accurate dimensional controls . A smooth surface is obtained , and both hardness and strength are increased . In general , the same results are obtained in the cold rolling of shafting , wire drawing , or other forms of cold work . Brittleness results if the metal is overworked , and an annealing operation is then necessary before further work can be done . Cold-Working Processes Press working may or may not accomplish the results just described . Operations involving bending , drawing , and squeezing metal result in grain distortion and changes in physical properties , whereas shearing or cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists the various methods of mechanically cold-working metals , including press operations . 215 // Tube drawing . Tubing which requires dimensional accuracy , smooth surface , and improved physical properties is finished by a cold-drawing operation . This method also produces tubes having smaller diameters or thinner walls than can be obtained by hot rolling . Special shapes and rounds up to 12 inches in diameter can be produced by this process . Hot-rolled tubing must first be treated by pickling and washing to remove all scale and then covered with a suitable lubricant . The drawing is done in a drawbench , shown diagrammatically in Figure 1 . One end of the tube is reduced in diameter by a swaging operation to permit it to enter the die , and it is then gripped by tongs fastened to the chain of the drawbench . In this operation the tube is drawn through a die smaller than the outside diameter of the tube , the inside stu lace and diameter being controlled by a fixed imindrel over // which the tube is drawn . This mandrel may be omitted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside diameter is not important . Drawbenches require a pulling power ranging from 50,000 to 300,000 pounds and may have a total length of 100 feet . The operation of drawing a tube is very severe : the metal is stressed above its elastic limit to permit plastic flow through the die . The maximum reduction for one pass is around 40% . This operation increases the hardness of the tube so much that , if several reductions are desired , the material must be annealed after each pass . Wire drawing . Wire is drawn by pulling a rod through several dies of decreasing diameter , as illustrated in Figure 2 , until the final diam eter is obtained . Rods from the mill , first cleaned in acid baths to remove scale and rust , are coated in various ways to prevent oxidation and to facilitate being drawn through the die . The dies are usually made of carbide materials , although diamonds may be used for small diameters . Both single-draft Or continuous-drawing processes may be used . In the first method a coil is placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed so that it will enter the die . The end is grasped by tongs on a drawbench and pulled through to such length as may be wound around a drawing block or reel . From there on , the rotation of the draw block pulls the wire through the die and forms it into a coil . These operations are repeated with smaller dies and blocks until the wire is drawn to its final size . In continuous drawing , as shown in Figure 3 , the wire is fed through several dies and draw blocks arranged in series . This permits drawing the maximum amount in one operation before annealing is necessary . The number of dies in the series will depend on the kind of metal or alloy being processed and may vary from 4 to 12 successive drafts . Metal spinning . Metal spinning is the operation of shaping thin metal by pressing it against a form while it is rotating . The nature of the process limits it to symmetrical articles of circular cross section . This type of work is done on a speed lathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning lathe is like the ordinary wood lathe except that , iii place of the usual tailstock , it is provided with some means of // holding the work against the form . The forms are usually turned from hard wood and attached to the face plate of the lathe , although smooth steel chucks are recommended for production jobs . This type figure of chuck will not develop interior imperfection and is more economical where surface finish is to be considered . Practically all parts are formed by the aid of blunt hand tools which press the metal against the form . The cross slide has a hand or compound tool rest in the front for supporting the hand tools and // some means for supporting a trimming cutter or forming roll in the rear . Parts may be formed either from flat disks of metal or from blanks that have previously been drawn in a press . The latter method is used as a finishing operation Ibr many deep-dawn articles . Most spinning work is done on the outside diameter as shown in the figure , although inside work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vases , and similar parts is done by having a small roller , supported from the compound rest , operate on the inside and press the metal out against a form roller . Figure 5 shows a cutaway view of a part being spun over an off-center chuck or roll . In an operation such as this one , the part must first be drawn , and possibly given a bulging operation beforehand , as spinning can not be done near the bottom . Contact of the spinning tools can only take place next to the chuck . Lubricants such as soap , beeswax , white lead , and linseed oil are used to reduce the tool friction . Of these , ordinary laundry soap // proves very satisfactory , particularly for aluminum spinning . Since metal spinning is a cold-working operation , there is a limit to the amount of drawing or working the metal will stand , and one or more annealing operations may be necessary . Spinning lends itself to shortrun production jobs , although it has many applications in continuous production work . It is frequently used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures , reflectors , kitchenware , and large processing kettles . Swaging and cold forging . These terms refer to methods of cold working by pressure or impact which causes the metal to flow to some desired shape . Swaging is usually thought of as a means of reducing the ends of bars or tubes by rotating dies which open and close on the work , as illustrated in Figure 6 . The rotating dies are rapidly opened and closed , and the end of the rod is tapered or reduced in size by a combination of pressure and impact . The swaging action , being rather severe , hardens the metal and necessitates an annealing operation if much reduction is desired . // Cold forging of heads on bolts , rivets , and other similar parts is done in cold-header machines . Since the product of the cold-header is made from unheated material , the equipment must be able to withstand the high pressures that are developed ; furthermore , there must be accuracy of alignment of the upsetting tool with the dies so that the work turned out will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine of this type is illustrated in Figure 7 . The rod is fed by straightening rolls up to a stop and is then cut off and moved into the header die . The heading operation may be either single or double , and upon completion the part is ejected from the dies . Roll-naking machines are also available which completely finish the i // bolt before it leaves the machine . In this machine the operations ( shown in Figure 8 ) consist of cutting off an oversize blank , extruding the shank , heading , trimming , pointing , and roll threading . All operations are carried on simul-taneously , and outputs range from 50 to 110 pieces per minute . Nails , rivets , and small bolts are made from coiled wire and forged cold , whereas large bolts require the end of the rod to be heated before the heading opera-tion . Coining and embossing . The operation of coining , shown in Figure 9 , is performed in dies which confine the metal and reEmbossing is more of a drawing or stretching operation and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually relieved so that it touches only that part of the blank that is being embossed . The mating die conforms to the same configuration as the punch so there is very little metal squeezing in the operation and practically no change in the thickness of the metal . Riveting and staking . Both these processes are used to fasten parts together , as illustrated in Figure 10 . In the usual riveting operation . a solid rivet is placed through holes made in the parts to IIc Listened Listened strict its flow in a lateral di rection . Shallow configurations on the surfaces of flat objects , such as coins , are produced in this manner . Special-type presses developing high pressures are required in this operation , and , because of this , its use is limited to fairly soft alloys. // together , and the end is pressed to shape by a punch . Hollow rivets may have the ends secured by curling them over the edges of the plate . Staking is a similar operation in that the metal of one part is upset in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other part . A staking punch may have one or more projections on it as shown in the figure , or it may be in the form of a ring with sharp chisel-like edges . Both operations can be performed on small presses as not much pres sure is required . Roll forming . Cold-roll-forming machines are constructed with a series of mating rolls which progressively form strip metal as it is fed continuously through the machine at speeds ranging from 50 to 300 feet per minute . " The number of roll stations depends on the intricacy of the part being formed ; for a simple channel four pairs may be used , whereas for more complicated forms several times that number may be required . In addition to the mating horizontal rolls , these machines are frequently equipped with guide rolls mounted vertically to assist in the forming operation and straightening rolls to true up the product as it emerges from the last forming pass . An example of this method of forming is shown in Figure 11 where tubular sections arc being produced by five pairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance welder after being formed and is continuously welded as it passes through the machine . After this operation the flash is removed and the completed tube straightened . This process is economical for large-quantity production of a uni formly true product . Only bending takes place in the forming , and the metal thickness is uniform throughout . The product may be cut to any length desired , and , with the proper attachments , the formed // product may be coiled into shape as is done in the manufacture of bicycle rims . Figure 12 shows a typical variety of shapes that have been roll-formed by this process . Plate bending . Another method of bending metal plates and strips into cylindrical shapes is by means of a roll-bending machine as illustrated in Figure 13 . This machine is made up of three rolls of the same diameter , two of them being held in a fixed position and one adjustable . As a metal plate enters and goes through the rolls , its final diameter is determined by the position of the adjustable roll ; the closer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the diameter . Machines of this type are made in capacities ranging from those that form small gage thicknesses to others that form heavy plates up to 1 ? inch in thickness . Seaming . In the manufacture of metal drums , pails , cans , and numerous other products made of light-gage metal , several types of // seams are used . The most common of these are shown in Figure 14 . The lock seam used on longitudinal seams is adapted for joints that do not have to be absolutely tight . After the container is formed , the edges are folded and pressed together . The compound seam , sometimes called the Gordon or box seam , is much stronger and tighter than the lock seam and is suitable for holding fine materials . Both these joints may be formed and closed on either hand- or power-seaming presses . Bottom seams , which are somewhat similar to the longitudinal seams , are made in either flat or recessed styles . Flat-bottom recessing is limited to one end of a container , as the container must be open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done on both ends of a container . Edge flanging , curling , and flattening , the operations necessary to make a recessed double seam , are shown in the figure . Double-seaming machines may be hand-operated , semiautomatic , or automatic . Semiautomatic machines must be loaded and unloaded by the operator , but the operation of the machine is automatic . In auto matic machines the cans are brought to the machine by conveyor , and ends are supplied by magazine feed . The cans are fed from the con226 Cold Forming of Metals ? Miscellaneous veyor to a star wheel , which transfers them to an automatic delivery turret . The delivery turret feeds them into position with the seaming heads , and the closing seam is made . Shot peening . This method of cold working has recently been developed to improve the fatigue resistance of the metal by setting up compressive stresses in its surface . This is done by blasting or hurling a rain of small shot at high velocity against the surface to be peened . As the shot strikes , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface metal to a depth of a few thousandths of an inch . This stretching of the outer fibers is resisted by those under neath , which tend to return them to their original length , thus pro ducing an outer layer having a compressive stress while those below are in tension . In addition , the surface is slightly hardened and strengthened by the cold-working operation . Since fatigue failures result from tension stresses , having the surface in compression greatly offsets any tendency toward such a failure . Shot peening is done by air blast or by some mechanical means . Figure 15 shows the unit from a machine that utilizes centrifugal force for hurling shot upon the work at a high velocity . This unit is similar to the one used in the machine shown in Figure 17 , Chapter /1 , for cleaning castings . Shot enters the funnel at 4 , which feeds it to the rotating wheel at G. The wheel then discharges the shot at a high // velocity by its rotation . The surface obtained by this action is shown in Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the size of shot used . Stress concentrations due to the roughened surface are offset for the reason that the indentions are close together and no sharp notches exist at the bottom of the pits. * Intense peen ing is not to be desired , for it may cause weakening of the steel . This process adds increased resistance to fatigue failures of working parts and can be used either on parts of irregular shape or on local areas that may be subject to stress concentrations . Surface hardness and strength are also increased , and , in some cases , the process is used II . F. Moore , Shot Peening and the Fatigue of Metals , American Foundry Equipment Company , 1944. // to produce a suitable commercial surface finish . However , it is not effective for parts subjected to reversing stresses , nor is its effect appreciable on heavy sections . Hobbing . Mold cavities , such as shown in Figure 17 , may be produced by forcing a hardened steel form or hob into soft steel . The hob , machined to the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain the necessary hardness and strength to withstand the tremendous pressures involved in the process . Pressing the hob into the blank requires much care , and frequently several alternate pressings and annealing are necessary before the job is complete . During the // hobbing operation the flow of metal in the blank is restrained from any appreciable lateral movement by a heavy retainer ring placed around it . The actual pressing is done in hydraulic presses having capacities ranging from 250 to 8000 tons . ' 1hc a ( Ivantage of the process is that multiple cavities may be // economically produced which are identical . The surfaces of the cavities have a highly polished finish and no machine work is necessary other than to remove surplus metal from the top and sides of the blank . This process is used a great deal in producing molds for the plastic and die casting industries . // CHAPTER I 0 COLD FORMING OF METALS PRESS WORK The machine used for most cold-working operations is known as a press . It consists of a machine frame supporting a bed and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause the ram to move in line with and at right angles to the bed . The illustrations in this chapter show numerous typical designs of press equipment . A press in itself is not sufficient as a production machine but must be equipped with tools commonly called dies and punches , designed for certain specific operations . Although some presses are better adapted for certain types of work than others , most of the forming , punching , and shearing operations can be performed on any standard press if the proper ( lies and punches are used . This versatility makes it possible to use the same press for many different jobs and operations , which is a desirable feature for short-run production . Presses are capable of rapid production , since the actual time of operation is only the time necessary for one stroke of the ram plus the time necessary to feed the stock . Accordingly , production costs may be kept very low . Any product that can be fabricated from thin metal and does not require extreme accuracy in dimensional tolerances can be economically made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass-production methods is evidenced by its wide application in the manufacture of automotive and aircraft parts , hardware specialties , toys , and kitchen appliances . Types of Presses A classification of press machines is difficult to make , as most presses are capable of varied types of work . Hence , it is not entirely correct to call one press a bending press , another an embossing press , and still another a blanking press , since all three types of operations can be done on one machine . However , sonic presses , especially designed 232 // for one type of operation , may be known by the operation name , as for example , a punch press , or a coining press . The simplest classifica tion would be according to source of power ? either manually operated or power-operated . Many manually operated machines are used for thin sheet-metal work , particularly in jobbing work , but most pro duction machines are power-operated . Other ways of grouping presses would be according to number of rams or method of operating the rants . Most manufacturers name them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many cases they are designated according to the power-transmitting arrangement or the main purpose for which the press will be used . If this method of classification is used , most presses can be listed under the following headings : In the selection of the type of press to use for a given job , a number of factors must be considered . Among these are the kind of operation to be performed , size of the part being worked upon , power required , and speed of operation . For most punching , blanking , and trimming operations , crank or eccentric-type presses are generally used . In these presses the energy of the flywheel may be transmitted to the main shaft either directly or through a gear train . For coining , squeezing , or forging operations , the knuckle-joint press is ideally suited . It has a short stroke and is capable of exerting a tremendous force . Presses for drawing operations normally operate at slower speeds than for operations such as blanking , and hydraulically operated presses are especially desirable for this work . The standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when working mild steel ; however , alu234 Cold Forming of Metals ? Press Work minum and other nonferrous metals may be worked at speeds up to 125 and 150 feet per minute . Hydraulic presses may also be used for forging , straightening , sizing , and similar operations . Inclined press . In Figure 1 is shown a single-action , single-crank , permanently inclined high-speed press having a capacity of 56 tons . The equipment on the right side of the press consists of a single-roll feed with a five-roll stock straightener and oiler . The fact that the frame of the machine is inclined is of value in discharging the work or scrap from the press . With the table in an inclined posi-tion parts can slide by gravity into a tote box , or material may be fed by chute into the dies . Most inclinable presses , however , are adjustable and may be varied from the verti-cal to a rather steep angle position . For diversified press work this arrangement is to be preferred as many jobs are best done with the press in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dis charged through the die . Inclinable presses are often preferred in the production of small parts involving bending , punching , shearing , and similar operations . Arch press . The arch-type press shown in Figure 2 is named from the peculiar shape of its frame . The lower part of the frame near the bed is wide to permit the working of large-area sheet metal ; the upper part is narrow . The crankshafts are small in relation to the area of the slide and press bed , as these presses are not designed for heavy work . The press in the figure is shown set up for a blanking operation on light-gage metal , which is typical of the work this press is designed to do . It is also used for stamping , bending , and trimming in the manufacture of large-sized paint cans and numerous other tin products . Other applications are the blanking and forming of shovels , the embossing of letters on metal panels , and the ' naiad ac c of kitchenware. // Gap press . Gap or C-frame presses are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . This design provides excellent clearance about the dies and permits the press to be used for long or wide parts . The usual stamping operations may be performed on a gap press , and frequently the inclinable feature is used with this type frame . Straight-side press . As the capacity of a press is increased , it be-comes necessary to increase the strength and rigidity of the frame . Straight-side presses accomplish this as loads imposed on the dies are taken up in a vertical direction by the heavy side frames and there is little tendency for punch and die alignment to be affected by the strain . I'resses of this type are made with many variations in means of ' II ) Iv inf power and the method of operation . For the smaller presses // a single crank or eccentric usually furnishes the power , but , as the size of the work increases , additional cranks are necessary to distribute the load on the slide uniformly . A straight-side , double-crank press , equipped with roller feed for moving stock across dies in a perforating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a single-acting press ; that is , there is only one driven ram used in the press operation . Double-acting presses , used a great deal for drawing operations have an outer ram which precedes the punch and clamps the blank before the drawing operation . The outer ram is usually driven by a special link motion or cams , whereas the inner ram carry ing the punch is crank-driven . Drawing operations may also be per formed on a single-acting press by clamping the blank with a holding ring backed up with air cushions below the bolster plate . Figure 4 is a view of a large straight-side toggle press drawing steel tops for automobiles . Pressure is applied on the slide in four places , which is a distinct advantage in large-area presses , as such construction prevents tilting of the slide with unbalanced loads . This press is a dou ble-acting toggle press , with built-in air-cushion drawing at IaUhIiICII ( s // The toggle mechanism in this machine is for the purpose of controlling the motion of the blank holder . " A toggle mechanism may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automobiles. be described as a grouping of cranks , levers , and slides with the necessary connecting links , so arranged that the train of movement nma% contain several dead-center positions at approximately the same // time . If the motion is so controlled that the several points pass through dead center a little way and back through it again in returning , the effective dwell period may be extended within certain limits . " * The dwell period means an interval of time during which there is no motion of the blank holder . This is necessary for blank holding on drawing operations , and it is frequently advisable to have a slight dwell on the punch to allow the metal to adjust itself properly under pressure . Straight-side presses are used on both mechanical and hydraulic presses . Typical operations performed by this type of press include work on heavy-gage metal , forging , coining , and deep drawing . Horn press . Horn presses are provided with a heavy shaft in place of the usual bed , or , if a bed is included , provision is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Figure 5 shows a horn press set up for a side-seaming operation . This press is used a great deal for work on cylindrical objects involving seaming , flanging edges , punch ing , riveting , and embossing . Press brake . A press brake , arranged for corrugating light-gage metal , is shown in Figure 6B , and Figure 6A above illustrates the setups for the progressive forming of a large bead on the edge of a long plate of steel . This figure illustrates the adaptability of this machine for * E. V. Crane , Plastic IPurking of Metals , john Wile S : Sons , p. 302. 239 // processing large sheets of relatively thin metal . Aside from the usual brake or forming operations , a press of this type may be used for corrugating , seaming , embossing , trimming , and multiple punching . These presses are made in lengths ranging from 4 to 20 feet , with metal thickness ranging from light gage to 58 inch . The pressure capacity of a press brake required for a given material is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the metal , and the radius of the bend . The minimum inside radius of a bend is usually limited to a radius equal to the thickness of the material ; however , the thickness rating of a press can be increased slightly if a larger radius is used . For bending operations the required pressure varies directly as the tensile strength of the material . Press brakes have short strokes and are generally equipped with an eccentric-type drive mechanism . Squaring shears . This machine is used entirely for shearing sheets of steel and is made in both manual and power-operated sizes . Figure 7 shows a large shear capable of shearing sheets up to a width of 10 feet . Hydraulic hold-down plungers are provided every 12 inches to prevent any movement of the sheet during the cutting operation . In operation the sheet is advanced on the bed so that the line of cut is under the shear . When the foot treadle is depressed , // the hold-down plungers come down , and the shearing blade cuts progressively across the sheet . Turret press . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper and lower turrets designed for carrying the different-size punches and dies . The two turrets are geared together and , when operating , are securely locked in position for exact alignment . The table shown in front of the machine with its cross slide offers an accurate and convenient means of locating the sheet under the punching station . When a number of identical parts are to be made , a fixed template is prepared and , if the template is followed with the movable stylus , all holes are accurately positioned . The large hand wheel just below the table is used for rotating the turret . Other machines of this general type have gaging tables which accurately position the work under the turret by turning two hand wheels in front of the operator . These punches are designed to handle short-run production and jobbing work in an efficient manner . Aside from ordinary metal punching , these machines can also be set up for slotting , embossing , notching , and louver operations . Power screw or percussion press . Figure 9 shows a percussion press aul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . The // friction drive accelerates the flywheel gradually on the clown stroke , and all its energy is utilized as it comes to a stop striking the work . Regulation of the blow is obtained by raising or lowering the position of the die . If the die is raised , the flywheel is stopped at a higher point and has less force , since its speed is less . For a given setting the blows are the same , and overloading is impossible . Since all the force of the blow is absorbed in the frame of the machine , expensive foundations are unnecessary . Small machines of this type are used for striking medals and signet rings , stamping and embossing jewelry , and similar applications . Larger machines can be used for cold-stamping and pressing small metal parts as well as for hot pressing brass and other forgeable metals . // The largest of these machines , exerting 50,000 foot-pounds per stroke , can be used to replace drop-forging operations . The hot pressing of brass ( 60% copper and 40% zinc ) has proved very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presses designed for coining , sizing , and heavy embossing must be quite massive to withstand the large concentrated loads imposed upon them . The press shown in Figure 10 is designed for this purpose and is equipped with a knuckle-joint mechanism tor actuating the slide . The upper link or knuckle of this point is hinged at the upper part of the frame at one end and fastened to a wrist pin at the other . The lower link also is attached to the same wrist pin and the other end to the slide . A third link is fastened to the ends of the wrist pin and acts in a horizontal direction to move the joint . As the two knuckle links are brought into a straight-line position , tremendous force is exerted by the slide . The press shown in the figure has a capacity of 150 tons . This type of press has always been widely used in the striking of coins . According to tests made at the Philadelphia United States Mint , a pressure of 98 tons is required to bring out clear impressions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from striking coins , many other parts , such as medals , key blanks , car tokens , license plates , watch cases and silverware , are coldpressed in this type of machine . Sizing , cold heading , straightening , heavy stamping , and similar operations can also be performed on this machine . As the stroke of this type of press is short and slow , it is not adapted to some of the usual press operations . hydraulic press . Hydraulic presses have longer strokes than inc lr ; inic ; il presses and develop , full tonnage throughout the entire // stroke . However , the capacity of these presses is readily adjustable , and only a fraction of the tonnage may be used if desired . Also the length of the strokes may be adjusted to whatever is needed . The presses are especially adapted to deep-drawing operations because of their slow uniform motion . They are also used for numerous other press operations requiring heavy tonnage such as briquetting powdered metals , extruding , laminating , plastic molding , and press forging . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-through shock is detrimental to the press . Maintenance is higher than for mechanical presses even though the operation of the press is much slower . The 800-ton press shown in Figure 11 is a self-contained unit with all pumping equipment mounted on top of the press . It is of the four-column-type construction and is adapted for drawing and forming operations . // Press for forming pipe . The three special hydraulic presses in Figure 12 progressively form 40-foot skelp into large tubes up to 26 inches in diameter . The skelp is formed to a U shape in the first press and to a near tubular section in the second and closed to a tubular form in the third . The joint is closed by flash welding , after which the flash is removed , the ends are faced , and the pipe is sized , straightened , and tested . Other methods of forming pipe are discussed in the previous chapter . Transfer press . Presses of this type are fully automatic and capable of performing consecutive operations simultaneously . Figure 13 shows the loading end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges . In this case round blanks are loaded in the stack feeder , but roll or other type feeders may be used if desired . In operation the stock is moved from one station to the next by a mechanism synchronized with the motion of the slide . Each die is a separate unit and is provided with a punch which may be inde pendently adjusted from the main slide . // The economic use of transfer presses is dependent upon quantity production , as their usual production rate is 500 to 1500 parts per hour . Typical products made by this equipment include headlight bodies , brake-drum shells , ice-cube trays , refrigerator doors , and stove parts . Drive Mechanism Used on Presses Figure 14 shows most of the drive mechanisms used in presses for transmitting power to the slide . The type of mechanism used in a given press is determined largely by the kind of work that is to be done . The most common drive is the single crank , which gives a movement to Flu ? slide approaching simple harmonic motion . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum velocity at midstroke , and is then decelerated . Most press operations occur near the middle of the stroke , at maximum slide velocity . The eccentric drive gives a motion like that of a crank and is often used where a shorter stroke is desired . Some proponents of this drive claim for it greater rigidity and less tendency for deflection than a crank drive might have . Cams are used where some special movement is desired , such as a dwell at the bottom of the stroke . This drive has some similarity to the eccentric drive , except that roll followers are used to transmit the motion to the slide . Rack and gear presses are used only where a very long stroke is desired . The movement of the slide is much slower than in crank presses , and uniform motion is attained . Such presses are provided with stops to control the stroke length and may be equipped with some quick-return feature to raise the slide back to starting position . The common arbor press is a familiar example of this type . Hydraulic drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . It is especially adapted to large pressures and slow speeds in forming , pressing , and drawing operations . In the screw drive , the slide is accelerated by means of the friction disk engaging the flywheel , and , as the flywheel moves down , greater speed is applied to it . From beginning to end of the stroke , the slide motion is an accelerated one . At the bottom of the stroke the entire amount of stored energy is absorbed by the work . The action resem-bles that of a drop hammer , but it is slower and there is less impact . Several link mechanisms are used in press drives , either because of the type of motion they have or because of the mechanical advantage they develop . The knuckle joint is very commonly used , because it has a high mechanical advantage near the bottom of the stroke when the two links approach a straight line . Because of the high load capacity of this mechanism , it is used for coining and sizing operations . The drive may be eccentric or hydraulic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toggle mechanisms , used primarily as a means of holding the blank on a drawing operation , are made in a variety of designs . The auxiliary slide in the figure is actuated by a crank , but eccentrics or cams may likewise be used . The principal aim of this mechanism ' is to obtain a motion having a suitable dwell so that the blank may be held effectively . Feed Mechanisms Safety is a paramount consideration in press operation , and every precaution must be taken to protect the operator . Wherever possible , // material should be fed to the dies by some means that eliminates any chance of the operator having his hands near the dies . In long-run production jobs such features can be economically worked out in various ways . Feeding devices are best applied to small- and mediumsized presses and have the advantage of rapid uniform machine feeding in addition to the safety features . One of the most common types of feeding mechanisms is the double-roll feed , as shown on the presses in Figures 1 and 3 . The operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link-age to a ratchet wheel .
