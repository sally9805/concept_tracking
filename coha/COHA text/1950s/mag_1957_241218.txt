Orpheus Descending is a rewrite by Tennessee Williams of a Williams play , Battle of Angels , that headed for Broadway in 1940 but folded in Boston . A certain sense of remodeling , of altered stairs and corridors , of trapdoors inserted and windows removed , hangs over the play . But the builder 's identity , whatever the stage or the style of construction , is never in doubt . Williams writes of life in a backward , bigoted Southern town , and of a young guitar-playing itinerant who arrives there . He becomes involved with its unhappy women , and as a result with its unreasoning men , to be chewed to death at last by its chain-gang bloodhounds . More intensively-amid daffy old ladies , a nymphomaniac outcast , knife-flashing bullies and gun-toting racists-it tells of the young man 's affair with a woman whose Italian father was burned to death by a mob , and whose husband helped burn him . Symbols of lostness and loneliness , they become victims of corruption and brutality . <P> At one point or another , Orpheus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does uniquely : whiplashing recrimination , harshly funny humor , the corrosive bite of evil , the shaking fingers of fright . Actress Maureen Stapleton has some extraordinary moments as the wife , Cliff Robertson some quietly effective ones as the guitar player . But , taken as a whole , the play fails , and for three reasons : a faultiness of structure , an obsessiveness of attitude , an empurpling theatricalism . <P> In Williams ' attempt at a kind of outer and inner story-in his ferocious portrayal of a whole community 's lynch-law intolerances that encircles his sordid , tense , sometimes maudlin idyl-there is more awry than a certain sprawl and shifting of tone . There is a real lack of causation and of vital connection ; the destructive social forces never bear down honestly or even credibly on the personal tale . But here it is the social critic who helps lead the craftsman astray-the Williams who is obsessed with violence , corruption and sex , who sees life through a cracked glass darkly , and who at the end-exactly as the cavalry were once summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It is hard , finally , to isolate material from method , the world 's violence from Williams ' own , because of the garish orchestrating of his protest , the sheer fireworks of his pessimism . Talent as vivid as Williams ' is often as lopsided ; few highly personal visions of life are notably panoramic . What tells against Orpheus Descending is less something limited than something lurid ; what vitiates the play , even as it animates it , is so canny a theater sense . It is the stage 's melodrama , not the world 's malevolence , that consistently wears its heartlessness on its sleeve .
