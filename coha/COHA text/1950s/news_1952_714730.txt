txt ACHESON REQUESTS SWIFT SENATE MOVE ON BONN CONTRACT Says Early Ratification Would I Ease Much of the Tension - Present in Europe Now WARNS OF NAZI REVIVAL Secretary Renews U. S. Pledge on Berlin ? Eden Indicates British Debate This Month By WILLIAM S. WHITE Special to Tim NEW YORK TIMES . WASHINGTON , June 10 ? SecIretary of State Dean Acheson deI eared today that the Senate by quickly approving the Allied peace contract and mutual defensive arrangements with West Germany could ease a considerable and unusual present tension in Europe . In the first place , he said , there is a " nervousness abroad " at the approach of the United States Presidential election , with its inevitable implication that the result conceivably might alter the high policies of the United States as of next year . In the second place there is now in Germany " a serious situation " in the revival of an old spirit of nazism , he added . This could be countered by Senate action that would at once bring West Germany back to free nationhood and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences of the Western orbit that it would thus be joining , Mr. Acheson intimated . In London , Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden indicated that the British Parliament might take up the ratification question before the end of June . Senate Group Opens Hearings Secretary Acheson appeared as the first witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as it opened hearings that ultimately will'jfesult in recommending to the Senate , perhaps next week , that it give its consent to the ratification of two more papers of state in the long planning for the common defense of the West . These are : 1 . A document technically called a " convention on relations " with Federal ( West ) Germany , but one that is in spirit though not in technical fact actually a treaty with West Germany on the one side and the United I States , Britain and France on the other . 2 . An alteration to the North Atlantic Treaty , in which fourteen nations stand pledged " one for all and all for one " against any Russian assault that would bring West Germany under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two agreements can not go into effect until the Senate has consented by a two-thirds majority . When this consent has been given , the European Defense Community will start at once to rise in actuality from the plans now existing for it , Mr. Acheson told the committee . The European Defense // Community is interlinked with both the Bonn peace contract and the alteration in the Atlantic Treaty . In his testimony , Mr. Acheson went out of his way again to reassure the French , who have been expressing fears to the United States that once the German got strong again they might repudiate the European Defense Community and strike out on their own . " There must be no misunderstanding in any quarter about how we would regard any act which would affect the integrity or unity of the European Defense Community , " said Mr. Acheson . He added that any such act would be considered " a threat against the security " of the United States , Britain and France , and would bring about at once consultations among the Western Big Three as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the common action necessary to ward off the threatened danger . " Mr. Acheson 's initial appearance before the committee  --  he will go back on the stand again tomorrow Ito be followed by John J. McCloy , United States High Commissioner in Germany  --  was in an atmosphere of serenity . If there was objection within the committee to the peace contract or to the Zlorth Atlantic Treaty , change it was not manifest at this ' first meeting . Discussing the declaration of intentions with which the United States , Britain and France , accomIpanied the contract with West ' Germany , the Secretary recalled pointedly that the United States intended to go on stationing troops in Germany . He said in answer to questions that so far as he knew the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff had no plans to send to Germany forces above the six United States divisions now on guard there . Amid general chuckling he declined to speculate as to what would happen if the Joint Chiefs , this country 's highest military body , should decide that more United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
