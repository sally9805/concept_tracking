Three times in his 62 years Jacques Lipchitz has had to rise from the ashes of disaster to pursue his career as a sculptor . When he was a youthful art student in Paris , his father , a Lithuanian contractor , lost all his money , told Jacques to give up and come home ; Lipchitz got a part-time job , kept on with his studies . In 1941 the Nazis forced Lipchitz to flee from France ; with only $20 to his name and some of his drawings , the sculptor had to begin all over again in the U.S. In 1952 , just as he had recovered from this blow , a fire burned his Manhattan studio and all it contained into cinders and melted plasteline ; Lipchitz got space in a Long Island foundry , resumed his work more vigorously than ever : in 26 days he turned out 26 small sculptures . <P> Last week the results of all this phoenixlike determination-and more than 40 years of dedicated sculpting-were on view at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , which was staging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 pieces of sculpture and 15 drawings covered the entire work span of Lipchitz ' life-from 1911 , when he modeled conservative academic pieces , through his first experiments with cubism , and down to his current , free-swinging style . <P> In most of Lipchitz ' work , there is evidence of a force and virility possessed by few contemporary sculptors , but , except for his earliest sculpture , there is very little conventional beauty in anything Lipchitz has done . Prometheus Strangling the Vulture II is typically powerful , but it is also unnecessarily cluttered . Mother and Child II shows a baby-burdened mother with stubby , handless arms outstretched in supplication for peace ; there is a belly-blow force in the conception of the statue , but the emotion it produces is something like that evoked by the sight of open sores on a crippled , shuffling beggar : pity mixed with revulsion . Song of the Vowels is a more straightforward experiment with form and space ; the curving harplike sides of the figure give it expanse and a sense of freedom . <P> Lipchitz himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last word in the development of his sculpture . He is always changing his approach , hopes to keep doing so . He feels that the lesson he learned from the fire in his studio ( " If you are thrown off a horse , you have to get right back on " ) is basically the same as that which is apparent in his current show . Says he : " One must go ahead . Life is an irreversible movement , and that 's the way with sculpture . . . I think I will now start my career . "
