At the edge of it a small , skinny boy stood staring big-eyed into the darkness . A tree creaked in the night wind . The boy looked wildly over his shoulder . He almost wished that somebody had noticed him slip out , but people hardly ever noticed little Alec . " Come on , Guinness ! " he told himself between chattering teeth . " Come on ! " He began to run . He ran clear around the football field as fast as his scrubby legs could carry him , and then ran round it again . He ran through the side door of the school auditorium . He ran onstage at the instant of his cue ( Enter a Messenger ) , staggered up to the startled young Macbeth and collapsed in a spectacular wreckage of words : " Gra , ( gasp ! ) cious my ( gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that ( wheeze ! ) which I ( glug ! ) . . .

He has been a larcenous bank clerk , a commuting bigamist , a middle-aged suffragette , a bootleg genius , a buck-toothed fiend , a garden editor who liked vegetables better than people , the contents of a cannibal stew , a family of eight , an intellectual ant . <P> Since 1950 , when Kind Hearts cleaned up at the art houses , British Cinemactor Guinness has steadily built his mass appeal in the U.S.-largely with his marvelously comical knack of hooking the odd fish . But his audience is not limited to moviegoers . As the star of hundreds of filler shows , which exhibit his comedies habitually , he is a stalwart TV attraction too . By the middle ' 50s , Guinness was pulling his TV audience into U.S. movie theaters , and movie publicists were bragging that , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known as Guinness , Alec ; that in fact , when it came to making a bundle for Britain , the Guinness movies were in a class with Scotch whisky and Harris tweed .
