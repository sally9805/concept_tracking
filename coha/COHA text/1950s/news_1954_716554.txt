txt LOS ANGELES , Sept. 26 ? Stirred by disclosures of union welfare rackets , the American Federation of Labor prepared today to pledge its aid in Government moves to root out abuses in administration of the funds . This break with the Federation 's historic policy of fighting Government interference . in internal union affairs is scheduled for formal approval at tomorrow 's closing session of the A. F. L. convention here . The Federation will set forth its readiness to cooperate in any objective survey of the problems involved in keeping welfare funds honest . It will urge that such surveys by Congressional and state investigators put the spotlight on the sins of insurance companies , brokers and employ ' ers , as well as of corrupt union officials . However , the A. F. L. will emphasize that its call for a balanced inquiry is not intended to shift attention away from union crooks or to shield them from punishment . The A. F. L. will demand that all its 113 affiliated unions exercise maximum vigilance in cleaning their own houses and bringing wrongdoers Ito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. F. L. president , has made it plain in conferences with other union chiefs that he believes a clean-up of welfare funds is the primary internal problem confronting the organization . He has set forth his conviction that legislative remedies will be necessary to supplement the self-policing activities of A. F. L. unions . Much of the Federation 's fire will be directed against state laws requiring the payment of brokerage fees and commissions on welfare fund accounts . Millions of dollars each year go to insurance agents for writing welfare contracts . Investigation in New York and other states have shown that these fees often became the basis for " kickbacks " to union officials or members of their families . In some instances , the broker performs no service in return for his commission . Experts on the union 's own staff advertise for competitive bids from insurance companies and select the one that offers the desired . protection at the lowest premium cost to the welfare fund . The union then learns that it can not legally apply the commission that would normally be paid to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fund . Either an agent must be brought in to collect the commission or the money is kept by the insurance company . As a result of this situation , many union officials have arranged to have relatives obtain agent 's licenses and pocket thou // sands of dollars in commissions ' without any effort or service . The ' A. F. L. wants the state laws changed in a way that would permit the elimination of brokers and agents altogether or that would cut their commissions so low there would be no incentive for kickbacks or illegal feesplitting . I The Federation has no direct authority under its constitution Ito deal directly with welfare ' racketeering in its international unions , several of which have been under criticism in recent inquiries . However , it does have the right to suspend or expel a union that brings discredit on the A. F. L. by failing to keep its own house clean . This was the basis on which the old International Longshoremen 's Association was kicked out of the Federation a year ago . The A , F. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ousted the organization when it failed to comply . No similar action is contemplated at this ( time against any of the unions involved in welfare scandals . Last Friday the A. F. L. convention tightened the regulations governing welfare funds run by federal labor unions , small local groups , which function under the ' direct supervision of the Federation itself . These unions represent 210,000 of the 10,200,000 workers who belong to the A. F. L. The convention ordered that William F. Schnitzler , A. F. L secretary-treasurer , make an annual audit of all welfare programs run by the federal labor unions . It empowered the parent group to revoke local charters , expel local officers or set up trusteeships if irregularities were discovered . The A. F. L. will urge all international unions to safeguard their funds by adopting similar rules . However , local unions In ( such powerful affiliates as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have shown little willingness to ' cede control over their funds to the heads of their , own internationals . It is the failure of such efforts at self'policing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal changes to take the profit out of welfare racketeering . Sharing interest with welfare funds at the convention 's final session tomorrow will be an A. F. L. program for " full pros- ? Iperity . " The program will put-i principal stress on an immediate expansion in public works , and housing outlays , an increase Ito $1.25 an hour in the present Federal minimum wage of 75 cents and in other measures to stimulate mass purchasing rower . The Federation will continue ' its attacks on the Eisenhower ' Administration , with special attention to its record pan unemployment . Editorials published today in the Federation 's official ' ' publication , the A. F. L. News'Reporter , condemned " the current ? ( crop of reactionaries ! n . Wash- . ington " for cutting appropriations for the Labor Department and for favoring stoelchold-e 's in the distribution of tax relief .
