ON Sunday night , September 23 , 1951 , Robert Keaton Christenberry received a telephone call in his apartment in the Astor Hotel , Times Square , New York City . The call was from Albany , and the caller was R. Burdell Bixby , executive assistant to Gov . Thomas E. Dewey . " Mr. Christenberry , " Bixby said , " Governor Dewey would like to see you here at three o'clock tomorrow afternoon . Will that be possible ? " It was , and at the appointed hour on the following afternoon Christenberry entered the executive chamber at Albany . At that moment he was , among other things , the president of the Astor Hotel , a major in the New York State Guard , a newspaper columnist , a Sunday-school teacher and an active figure in more business , civic , welfare and fraternal organizations than you could count on the fingers of both hands . When he emerged from the governor 's office two hours later , he was also the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been joined to the crusade to clean up boxing . " I can tell you , " Christenberry says , " that on My way to Albany I wondered why the governor wanted to see me . I can tell you that I wondered a whole lot more on my return trip . " The wonder that pervaded Christenberry 's mind was as nothing , however , compared to that which Swept the boxing business when his appointment was announced . The announcement was not greeted by a stunned silence , but only because the denizens of the fight game , while occasionally stunned , are never silent . " I am astounded , " said Nat Fleischer , boxing historian , editor of The Ring magazine and of The Ring Record Book , and one of the sport 's more intelligible voices . " We knew a new commissioner was going to be appointed , but I thought , in view of all the commotion in boxing and the adverse criticism , that someone would be appointed who is closely allied to boxing and knows it thoroughly . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who knows nothing about it ? " That a clean-up was what the governor had in mind he left no doubt . His appointment of Christen-berry to succeed Edward P. F. Eagan , former Rhodes scholar and Olympic boxing champion who had headed the commission since 1945 , had been precipitated by New York City 's third boxing fatality in nineteen months , a death that had set the press to clamoring for reform , in some cases for the abolition of the sport , and that had brought forth from the governor a five-point program of reform . On August twenty-ninth , George Flores , a twentyyear-old Brooklyn welterweight , had climbed through the ropes at Madison Square Garden to meet Roger Donahue , a young middleweight from Yonkers , New York . Five days later Flores had died from injuries suffered when knocked out in the eighth round . Flores , the press discovered , had been knocked out in his two previous bouts , stopped in two rounds on July twenty-fourth , by Jchnny Cerky , and stopped in the eighth round on August fourteenth by Donahue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , the press asked , had such a mismatch been permitted ? Why had ( Continued on Page 97 ) the state 's Medical Advisory Board , constituted in 1948 with nine members , been allowed to wither until only two members remained active ? Was n't the governor aware of what was going on in the boxing center of the world ? In Washington , previous to the Flores death , other questions had been raised . Early in August , Senators Herman Welker , R. , Idaho , and Harry P. Cain , R. , Washington , had charged that the International Boxing Club , with headquarters in Madison Square Garden and controlling other arenas in Chicago , Detroit and St. Louis , was operating a monopoly , and that fighters not tied in with the I.B.C. were unable to obtain title bouts . They had introduced a resolution to investigate boxing ? a resolution that bore fruit in October , when a Federal grand jury investigation of boxing in general and the I.B.C. in particular was inaugurated in New York . Beyond these immediate issues were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the vital organs of the sport  --  the influence of the underworld and the existence of incompetent , in some cases even dishonest , officials . When the Kefauver Committee had brought its investigation of the underworld into New York , there had been every expectation in the fight game that now it , too , would come under the white light of public scrutiny . When it did n't , opinion switched to the feeling that the Government was merely biding its time . It was against this background that Christenberry , whose knowledge of boxing could not even match that of the average fan on the street , took office . That Christenberry walked in with his eyes closed is probably true . He accepted a job that no man with full knowledge of the situation has ever sought , after a two-hour briefing by a governor who , although aware of the basic problems , could not possibly be acquainted with all the complications involved . Christenberry , however , is a supremely confident man . This confidence , so evident in attitude and utterance , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes in strange fields and often against long odds . During World War II , for example , he was called one day to City Hall , even as he was called to the State Capitol last September . Fiorello LaGuardia was then the mayor of New York . " Bob , " he said , " you 're the new director of fingerprinting . " " Fingerprinting ? " Christen berry said . " What am I supposed to do ? " It was LaGuardia 's feeling that everyone in New York ? man , woman and child ? should be fingerprinted . To sell this idea in a crowded , busy and blas ? city was not the easiest of assignments . " We lined up prominent people in every phase of endeavor , " Christen-berry ialys . " We fingerprinted them in Macy 's window , in front of the Father Duffy statue in Times Square , in churches , schools and theaters . That was the way we brought the project to the public . " Within several months the mayor was forced to call Christenberry off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were overflowing a room in City Hall , where provisions for classification and filing were inadequate . Even the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted no part of trying to cope with the flood . During World War II , Christen-berry , adviser on the hotel industry to the Office of Price Administration , was also in charge of air-raid wardens on Manhattan Island . He was named top man in the borough after attaining surprising success as head of civilian defense for the Times Square area , where , even in wartime , the hotels , theaters , night clubs and sidewalks were crowded with strangers . He sold his ideas first to the newspaper columnists , then to the well-known theatrical and night-club personalities , and the public fell into line . " New York is not a big city , " Christenberry , who likes to think of himself as a small-town boy , said then to explain his success , and he has repeated this dogma many times . " This is a small town , a town of small communities . Times Square is the village green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unofficial Mayor of Times Square , " and he is now serving his twelfth consecutive term as president of the Broadway Association . The purpose of the association , made up of about 1500 businessmen , is to oppose the licensing of enterprises that would detract from the atmosphere of the most famous Main Street in the world . It has been fighting gallantly , in some cases even successfully , against the invasion of shooting galleries , penny arcades and assorted sucker traps . So Christenberry comes to boxing with some knowledge of sharp characters , commodity in which the sport abounds . " But I do not believe , " he says , " that everybody connected with boxing is a crook . Thus I do not feel that the job the governor and the people of New York want done can not be done . " Those who have worked closely with Christenberry on other projects say that this reflects his attitude toward any task he assumes . He refuses to recognize any obstacle as insurmountable . After all , he did overcome the loss of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , married and the father of a son , twenty-one , and a daughter , sixteen . He was born in a small settlement between Huntington and Milan , in Gibson County , Tennessee . He was the second youngest in a family of three girls and two boys . His father was an R.F.D. mail carrier who , for a while , published a small weekly newspaper . When Christenberry was seventeen and in his senior year at Milan High School , where he was a superior student , with a flair for debating , he ran away from home and , falsifying his age , enlisted in the marines . In France he was pulled out of the line near Verdun and sent to Officers ' Training Camp . It was there , during field maneuvers , that he pulled the pin on what proved to be a defective hand grenade . When he had his arm cocked to throw , the grenade exploded , taking his hand and putting a hole in his head . He spent two and a half months in American hospitals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further hospitalization . It was during this period that he faced the biggest problem of his life . " I wrote a letter home , " he says . " When I finished , after much laborious effort , I could n't read it myself . Like most , I had been accustomed to use only my right hand , and I realized then there were certain things I would have 98 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 16 , 1952 to learn all over again . It was the most trying moment I have ever known . " Christenberry , who is a devout Presbyterian , a great advocate of Bible reading and of the efficacy of prayer , says that he " did a little first-class praying " then , as he still does when up against a tough problem . Today he is still extremely proud of the recovery he made , and it is obvious he regards the empty sleeve as a badge of honor and as evidence of his ability to come from away back in the field . " Recently , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my right hand . I was amazed to find it identical with my present signature . " Christenberry is unable to tie his shoelaces or a bow tie , but nothing , he says , delights him more than to show off his ability to tie a four-in-hand . He drives a car and breaks ninety at golf . While he was hospitalized , Christen-berry also fortified his interrupted education by becoming an avid reader of anything he felt would make him better informed . He applied himself to correspondence-school courses and took the first steps toward acquiring the poise that now distinguishes him in public appearances , by talking , in the late stages of the war , at Liberty Bond rallies . At one of these rallies , at Forest Hills , New York , he impressed , among others , Charles Pope Caldwell , a New York congressman . Through Caldwell he got his first job , an appointment to the American consulate in Vladivostok , where he spent a year in charge of the code . From Vladivostok he was transferred , as vice-consul , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He served there for two years and then switched to the Division of Passport Control and Citizenship in the Department of State , in Washington . He put in a year at that , and then took a job for fifteen dollars a week as a reporter on the Washington Herald . He was with that paper , on and off , for three years , and between jobs there spent a year in Kansas City editing Foreign Service , the official publication for the Veterans of Foreign Wars . In 1926 a bronchial condition forced him to shift to Jacksonville , Florida , and a job on the Florida Times-Union . In Florida he was enlisted , by Gov . John W. Martin and the State Hotel Commissioner , Jerry Carter , as a deputy hotel commissioner . He later assumed the managership of the Jacksonville Tourist and Convention Bureau . " I was also , " he says , " secretary of the Hotel and Restaurant Association , statistician and director of publicity . I also handled the membership , because that 's how I got paid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heard and Seen , for the Jacksonville Journal . " Christenberry left Florida in 1929 to enter the hotel field , in which , within a dozen years , he was to rise to the top . Several years ago Billboard dispensed with an annual practice of polling newspapermen to determine the best-known hotelman in the United States . Christenberry had won the poll five years straight . " A man came into the Chamber of Commerce in Jacksonville while I was there , " Christenberry says , " and wanted information about the city . I not only gave him bank clearings and the post-office receipts but the tonnage entering and departing report and all other information a businessman might want . " Deeply impressed by this show of efficiency , the man , who had an interest in the Winton Hotel  --  now the Carter  --  in Cleveland , hired Christenberry to jack up the hotel 's business promotion . In the next six years he was associated with a number of hotels , including the Barlum , Book-Cadillac and Park Avenue in Detroit , the Jefferson in Peoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christenberry put the Jefferson on its feet and had it making money in little snore than a year . He did the same kind of job with the Roosevelt in Pittsburgh . The Roosevelt was in bad shape , " he says , " and there was no money . We could n't advertise as the newest , the oldest or the largest hotel . We did have money to buy soap and water , however , so we advertised as the cleanest . We put every emphasis on cleanliness , and it paid off . " Off his success with the Roosevelt , Christenberry was brought to New York in 1935 as vice-president and general manager of the Astor , which , following the financial crash , found itself in increasingly desperate circumstances . Christenberry has made a success of this job too . He concentrated on renovation and promotion , eventually spending $2,000,000 , although the City Bank Farmers Trust Company hesitated at first to put much money into the project . In his new field of boxing , as the sports writers get to know Christen-berry , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Leahy , the Notre Dame football coach . He is an impeccable dresser and one of the most poised and courteous of men . He makes a practice of remembering first names , couches the simplest of answers in prose that would not be out of place in a public address . Yet beneath all this he can be very unbending , even tough . This last became obvious within the sixty days Christenberry gave himself to get under way . Ten days after he assumed public office , his first public act  --  performed in consort with his fellow commissioners , Dr. Clilan B. Powell and Leon F. Swears  --  was to revoke the license of former featherweight champion Willie Pep , suspend featherweight champion Sandy Saddler for what was to prove sixty days , and slap a thirty-day suspension and $100 fine on Charley Johnston , Saddler 's manager . Pep and Saddler had fought in the Polo Grounds two days after Christen-berry 's appointment . Before Pep retired at the end of the ninth round , this first fight under the new regime had degenerated into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants and the referee on the floor . The fight fraternity had waited to see what Christenberry would do about it . While there may be some outside the sport who feel that Christen berry might have been even tougher , the consensus among boxing men and the New York sports writers was that he had acted well and with an iron hand . Christenberry bore out this evaluation the second time a boxer came before him . On November fifteenth , at the Broadway Arena , a small New York City club , Rocky Compitello , a Brooklyn middleweight , caused a near riot when he punched and kicked referee Jack Appel . Eight days later Christenberry and the two other commissioners revoked the fighter 's license , and Christenberry made it clear that the penalty would stick . " I advise that you get another livelihood , " he told the fighter , " for as long as I am a member of this commission you never will be permitted to box in the state of New York . " life , fined him $3000 , and barred him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur 's gestions from staff members were so attitude . To him , boxing was only frequently ignored and morale was so incidentally a big business . The faults low that subordinates who did have of the Eagan regime were many , and what they believed to be constructive were fairly well summarized in the ideas found it easier to forget them . statement issued by Dewey when he Christen berry , on the other hand , is a announced the Christenberry appoint- man who demands a lot of his department . At that time the governor laid ment heads . He isan exacting executive , down a five-point plan that , while and while not the easiest man for framed in general terms , was surpris- whom to work , he does have a way of ingly comprehensive in its coverage of getting people to go all out for him . men whose identities , if they were known , would not always add luster to the cause . The possibilities of this ever being eradicated are , at best , remote . It is known , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the commissions representing other states , that Frank Carbo , an ex-convict , controls a number of fighters today , as he has for the past twenty years . Carbo has a police record that goes back to 1915 and includes seventeen arrests for such transgressions as murder , felonious assault , armed robbery , grand larceny and hotel fraud . One of the comanagers of Rocky Graziano , the former middleweight champion of the world , is Eddie Coco , now out on bail pending appeal after being sentenced to life imprisonment in Miami , Florida , last spring for the murder of a parking-lot attendant . Previously , Coco had been arrested a dozen times , charged variously with vagrancy , robbery , disorderly conduct , felonious assault and rape . Yet he not only functioned as one of Graziano 's managers but was paid out of the fighter 's purses by check . In the case of Coco the canceled checks would have been evidence enough , had the commission , under Eagan , been interested in enforcing that portion of the state boxing law which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most instances , however , there is no such airtight evidence , and it is this that hamstrings any commission in its efforts to cleanse the ring sport of underworld influence . It is fairly obvious , however , that today any underworld figure who moves into boxing must have at least one of two things to offer an otherwise legitimate manager or fighter . He must either be able to obtain lucrative matches from promoters who control such matches or he must have influence with officials who work bouts , so that he can guarantee decisions . The task that faces Christenberry , now governing boxing in the state where the vast majority of important bouts are held , thus embraces the necessity of determining in what sphere such a man as Carbo has authority . Can he guarantee matches or can he guarantee the outcome of matches ? Does he , in other words , do business with promoters or with referees and judges ? ? The New York commission is made up of , in addition to the chairman and two commissioners , an executive secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief inspector and thirty-five boxing inspectors . All of these are , like the chairman himself , political appointees . The only employees who enjoy civil service are clerks . This is a condition that obtains in boxing throughout the United States . Positions of authority in the sport are , first of all , political plums . The ability of a candidate is only incidental . In 1928 John V. Grombach , a West Point graduate and six-sport athlete at the academy , former intercollegiate heavyweight boxing champion and member of the 1924 Olympic boxing team , requested of John J. Phelan , then chairman of the New York commission , appointment as a boxing referee or judge . He was informed that boxing officials had to apply through Democratic Party channels . In 1945 Grombach made the same request of Eagan , a Republican . He was again notified that such applications must be cleared with political leaders . Only the identity of the party in power . had changed . Christenberry thus tackles his tough task dependent upon the services of men who hold their positions through political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , although he does have under him several men with exceptional talents . Foremost among these is Daniel J. Dowd , the executive secretary . Dowd served for eleven years  --  the last eight as a criminal investigator  --  with the office of the district attorney of New York County , under Dewey and Frank Hogan . He is a Democrat , which surprised many when Dewey appointed him to the Athletic Commission job several years ago . He has distinguished himself in the eyes of the honorable men in boxing as an honest , efficient , hard-working man who has come to know the fight game intimately . Under Eagan. what little investigatory work was done by commission personnel was done by the men on their own . It was the feeling of Eagan that investigation was solely within the province of the district attorney . Under Christenberry there has been a reversal of this attitude . At the end of October he announced the appointment of Manuel L. Robbins , of New York City , as special counsel . Robbins has been assigned the job of carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey 's demand for free competition and the cleansing of boxing of disreputable personnel . One of the most flagrant faults in the conduct of boxing is that a man can enter without serving an apprenticeship or in any way proving his qualifications to manage or train a fighter . In New York State all a man needs to become a manager is a fighter willing to sign a contract with him , and fifteen dollars for a license fee . To become a trainer and second , all he needs is five dollars for a license . As a result , the boxing game is suffering today from a lack not only of earnest young men desirous of making a living as fighters but also of competent managers and trainers . In some states trainers are required to take an examination , but these tests are cursory at best . So the sport is full of incompetent handlers who send young men out to risk physical injury , even death . The problem of efficiently screening all managers and handlers , and of establishing training courses and enforcing apprenticeships for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , have to face . There is no apparent explanation of why previous commissioners have been allowed to escape this obligation . The New York commission , in spite of the fact that it is the most influential in the sport , is only one of forty-eight commissions functioning in this country . The other forty-seven are banded together in an organization known as the National Boxing Association . Even the N.B.A. , however , has been unsuccessful , on many occa sions , in attempting to unite its own membership . Although , at present , New York has working agreements with seven other states and with the boxing commissions of Havana and Ontario , Christen-berry will find that these agreements mean little when they mean the loss of the revenue from a big fight . The policing of boxing , he will discover , can never be successfully carried out solely as a local task . Christenberry came into his new job bulwarked with a personal prestige of which he is justifiably proud . When his appointment was announced he received congratulatory messages from members of the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Clark and Omar Bradley , as well as from the Bartenders Union . At the time of the appointment , . Christenberry was in the third year of turning out , with the assistance of ghost writers , a weekly column called You Meet Such Interesting People . As he was identified in the by-line as president of the Astor , this served to focus attention on the hotel in the 140 papers to which the column was serviced . A genuinely civic-minded man , he also earned wide respect not only for himself but for his hostelry by his devotion to such organizations as the Red Cross , the Travelers Aid Society , the Greater New York Fund , the Catholic Charities and the United Jewish Appeal . " The man has a terrific public-relations sense , " says Hy Gardner , the Broadway columnist of the New York Herald Tribune , who was Christen-berry 's press agent from 1939 to 1950 . " He knows instinctively what the public will buy . I got the credit for building up the guy , but all I did was take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's more , a lot of the stuff he did he did n't want a line on . " In associating himself with boxing , Christenberry now becomes a part of the most vilified of sports . There has never been a boxing commissioner who has not carried away from the job some scars inflicted by a press which delights in hauling off on rainy days against what Jimmy Cannon , sports columnist of the New York Post , calls , typically , " the red-light district of sports . " The job pays only $10,231.35 a year . Christen berry took it , as he has accepted other assignments of a public nature , as a duty . " When a man lives in a community and makes his living there , " he says , " he should be willing to accept any assignment from the public or the public 's representative that he believes to be for the public good . " Christenberry is a man bolstered by the realization that he rose from a modest beginning to become a leader in the hotel industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He has been successful as a troubleshooter in a variety of fields , and he has only to look down at his empty right sleeve to be reminded that no task should seem unconquerable . The fact remains , however , that he walked in unaware of the full complexities of his assignment . This may prove the one time when his self-confidence was excessive . The feeling along New York 's West 49th Street , boxing 's bourse , is that no one man , not even Christenberry , can be completely successful in cleaning up a sport which for so Long has suffered as a political punching bag .
