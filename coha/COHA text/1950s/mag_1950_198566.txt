Trooping into &; out of a green-walled Manhattan studio one night last week were a Long Island housewife , a Parisian antique dealer , Actress Gertrude Lawrence , two delinquent boys , a city judge , Critic John Mason Brown , an employment agent , an interior decorator , and Nobel Prizewinning Physicist Robert Millikan . When the last interview was over , four hours later , 66-year-old Eleanor Roosevelt appeared to have as much energy as when she started . She also had , tidily recorded on platters , enough material for at least a week of the 45-minute Eleanor Roosevelt Program ( Mon. through Fri. , 12:30 p.m. ) over Manhattan 's WNBC . <P> First , a Teaser . Another Roosevelt-son Elliott-is deeply involved in the show . His official position is president of the radio-TV " package " firm , Roosevelt &; Jones , Inc . But , possibly because Mrs. Roosevelt 's radio show and her TV show ( Sun . 3:30 p.m. , NBCTV ) are the only ones he has on the air , Impresario Elliott serves in many other capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his determined salesman 's geniality in offhand invitations such as the one he gave Fred Allen : " Come on over and have some fun with mother . " He supervises the recording of interviews ( " Hold it , Mother , there 'll be a teaser first " ) , and he writes and personally delivers the commercials for such sponsors as McKettrick Williams dresses ; Sitroux tissues ; Manischewitz products ; the Toni Co. ' s Bobbi Pin Curl Home Waves , and the Illinois Meat Co . <P> Mrs. Roosevelt 's own inexhaustible fund of chatty conversation and the glamour of her guests ( some of the recent ones : Boxer Ezzard Charles , Cartoonist Al Capp , Minister Perle Mesta , Actress Tallulah Bankhead ) have given the program a 2.7 Pulse rating against the 2.3 of her veteran rival Mary Margaret McBride . But what disconcerts many listeners is the drumfire of basic-English commercials , fead in pear-shaped Grotonese , with which the show is slittered . Mrs. Roosevelt may murmur to a distinguished guest : " And now I think Elliott would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Elliott would like to say is a good word for the sponsors . Often , he drags other Roosevelts into the spiel : " The other day we were driving in from the country and one of the children suddenly called out that there was a great , big bird in the sky . . . Sure enough , there it was , the great big Flamingo blimp , advertising Flamingo orange juice . . . " or " . . . In fact , Mother . I remember when you used to buy numbers of the famous Emerson portables to give away as Christmas presents ; . . " <P> This lending of the Roosevelt name to the hawking of noodle soup and hearing aids has already inspired a broad parody from New York World Telegram &; Sun Columnist H. I. Phillips , as well as the expected blasts from Westbrook Pegler . Elliott is saddened by such comments , but not surprised . " You always get carping criticism , people saying it 's nothing but a money-making proposition , " he explains . " But mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve sponsors . Sponsors are a sign of success . "
