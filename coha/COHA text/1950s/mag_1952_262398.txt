Vermont House Painter Patsy ( for Pasquale ) Santo exhibited his first canvas in 1938 in hopes of getting a free ticket to the Rutland State Fair . He did not get the ticket , but his landscape , painted in oils from the local drugstore , won the art competition at the fair . Patsy bought himself some more paints and brushes and has been painting ever since . <P> Last week seven of Santo 's oils were hanging in a Manhattan show of " Contemporary American Natural Painters " His pictures of Vermont hills and quiet snowy village streets are accurate in perspective and detail , subdued in color . But for all his near-professional realism , Santo still retains his fondness for simple storytelling subjects , e.g. , Sunday Morning a woman and child walking up a snowy street toward a white steepled church or Sugaring , a farmer and his sledge in late-winter maple woods . " Maybe I do it a little different than other people , " says Santo . " When I do a landscape , I start with the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . I like to get the far objects into it just as much as the near . " The results are often closer to the slick naturalism of Luigi Lucioni than to the guileless sincerity of primitives like Grandma Moses . <P> Since Vermont 's housepainting season is a short one , Santo finds plenty of time for his art . " All summer I paint houses to earn a living . All winter I hibernate and paint pictures to please myself . If I sell more pictures , I paint less houses . " Santo manages to finish 12 to 15 canvases a year and has sold paintings to half a dozen museums , including Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney . <P> Last week , with Vermont 's snows just beginning to shrink , Santo was busy in his backyard studio finishing a picture of Bennington 's Baptist Church . In another month , he will exchange his canvases and palette for buckets and ladder . His big ambition is to sell enough pictures to be able to give up house painting for good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
