It takes a hardy man to predict the future of the human race for the next million years . Such a man is Charles Galton Darwin , 65 , grandson of the late great Charles Robert ( The Origin of Species ) Darwin , and former Master of Christ College , Cambridge . His just-published book , The Next Million Years ( Doubleday ; $2.75 ) , is sugar-coated with flowing , donnish English , but it contains a bitter pill for people with faith in human progress . The ultimate future of the race , says Writer Darwin , will be much like its deplorable past . <P> Darwin is a theoretical physicist , but he invades sociological territory where many sociologists fear to tread . He bases his reasoning about man 's future on what is sometimes called " social physics " : the idea that the behavior of humans in very large numbers can be predicted by the statistical methods that physicists use with large numbers of molecules . <P> Gloomy Prediction . Physicists know that the motions of single molecules ( e.g. , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slow and zigzag in any direction . But the impacts of billions of gas molecules against a restraining surface produce a steady push that obeys definite and rather simple laws . In the same manner , Darwin believes , the actions of individual humans are erratic and sometimes remarkable , but the behavior of large numbers of them over long periods of time is as predictable as the pressure of gas . All that is needed is to determine the basic , averaged-out properties of human " molecules . " <P> In Darwin 's view , the human molecules have one fundamental property that dominates all others : they tend to increase their numbers up to the absolute limit of their food supply . This is the familiar thesis of Thomas Malthus , a senior contemporary of Grandfather Darwin whose gloomy predictions of starvation have haunted mankind for 150 years . <P> Grandson Darwin restates Malthus . Human increase , he says , is a " geometrical progression . " The more it has increased , the faster it will increase in the future . Food supply , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition . Past increases do not add to its speed of increase . <P> The natural rate of increase of passably well-fed peoples , Darwin says , leads them to double their numbers every 100 years . To feed the doubled population , food production must be doubled too . Twice as much land must be cultivated or the old land must be made twice as productive . In the next century the population will double again , and the earth must produce four times as much food as it does now . <P> Darwin admits that present-day food production can be stepped up . He says , for instance , that a way of turning wood into human food would be a great forward step . The Germans used this very simple process on a large scale during World War II , and " wood molasses " for cattle feed has been produced in small quantities in the U.S.
