For Wall Street it was the most hectic week in years . The stock market , which has been sliding gradually downhill for three months , suddenly nose-dived and opened the week with the biggest one-day break since 1955 . The Dow-Jones industrial average plummeted ten points to 423.06 , lowest level since May 1955 . Every major group took a beating in the slump , with drops in such stocks as Du Pont , American Telephone &; Telegraph , Bethlehem Steel , Goodyear , Alcoa and all but three of the 25 rails . <P> Much of the selling was in odd lots ( less than 100 shares ) from all across the U.S. , and stocks were dumped at any price in a flurry of panicky selling by small investors , often in direct contradiction to the economic facts . The market rout was also aided by professional short selling , and forced sales to meet margin calls from brokers ( though such calls went out to only about 5% of margin accounts ) . <P> Wall Street professionals blamed the selling spree on a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense program , trouble in the Middle East , fears that the Federal Reserve 's tight-money policy might be triggering a recession . " Business is not that bad , " said James Crane Kellogg III , chairman of the Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange . " As a matter of fact , it 's good . " The facts showed that business , moving at historically high levels , was indeed far better ( see below ) than business sentiment . Yet Wall Street , which likes to talk of the investor 's lack of knowledge , could blame itself for much of the gloom . From brokerage offices have poured forth a flood of market letters , rumors and reports that painted the current economic picture in unwarrantedly pessimistic colors . <P> But to some investors the big sell off of the early week was just the chance they had been waiting for . As the fainthearted beat down prices , they moved in for the rebound . Some confidence was also gained by President Eisenhower 's decision to make a series of speeches on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fed 's restrictive policies . Up shot the market at midweek in the sharpest single day 's point gain since 1929 , recouping the losses of the two previous days . <P> The market held its own Thursday , overcame an early selling surge Friday to close at 435.15 . For the first time since January 1955 , the market had experienced four 4,000,000-plus volume days . Despite the attrition of the early week , its aggregate value rose about $1.2 billion for the week , and the Dow-Jones average gained 1.32 points . Significantly , institutional buyers and mutual funds held fast during the market 's gyrations , steadily bought up stocks-often at bargain prices . <P> As to where the market would go next , few were hazarding a guess . Members of the Commerce Department 's Business Advisory Council , meeting in Hot Springs , Va . with Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks , foresaw a lull in business expansion , but predicted that business will continue at a high plateau through most of 1958 , though it might slip 1% or 2% . Plainly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business scene , has already discounted a much bigger drop in business than any economist or businessman could foresee .
