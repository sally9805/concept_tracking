Besides having one of the richest diets and the most varied menus on earth , Americans daily consume a haphazard assortment of an estimated 400 chemicals added to foods as preservatives , coloring agents , antioxidants , mold inhibitors , bleaches , thickeners , thinners , emulsifiers and moisteners . This week , to take both the hap and the hazard out of the addilives , a new law ( signed by President Eisenhower six months ago ; becomes effective . Its burden : before processors may add any chemical to food , its safety must be proved to the satisfaction of the Food &; Drug Administration . <P> Long Way to Market . While this seems simple common sense , it took eight years to persuade Congress to enact a direct reversal of the old law-under which the burden of proof was on the FDA to 1 ) show that ar additive in food already marketed was dangerous , and 2 ) get it banned by court order . Need for the new law has been intensified by speeding changes in U.S. food growing , marketing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home or near the point of consumption ; more and more is shipped great distances , takes longer to reach the table , goes through increasingly complex processing to make prefabricated dishes or whole dinners for supermarket dispensers . Simultaneously , chemical manufacturers have been synthesizing new substances whose long-range effects on the human body are not yet known . <P> Since most food processors have neither the facilities nor the know-how , it will usually be up to the chemical manufacturers themselves to prove the safety of additives . The law covers those already in use , with a time allowance for testers to tackle the backlog , as well as any proposed for future use . The test technique : put the additive in an appropriate food and give it to laboratory animals ( 150 rats , 21 dogs , at three-dose levels ) for their natural lifetime or a minimum of two years . Even if the critters die natural deaths , their bodies will still be dissected to see whether any damage can be traced to the additive . If there is any suspicion of cancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost industry millions . And the FDA needs an additional $1,000,000 a year to check the test methods and data . <P> When Is a Poison ? Nobody knows how many of the additives now in use have been fully tested . Best guess : about 150 are tried and true , will cause no problem , e.g. , old familiars such as sodium benzoate ( preservative in foods and many soft drinks ) , and other items less recognizable but long widely used-calcium or sodium propionate ( mold inhibitor in bread ) and butylated hydroxy anisole ( antioxidant to keep fats from going rancid ) . Another 150 are expected to pass the tests , but 100 or more are in a medical no-man 's land .
