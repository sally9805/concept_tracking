When Chicago Sun-Times Reporter Ray Brennan got hold of some secret testimony before the Kefauver crime committee , his story was a heavy blow to the Democrats . It cost " Tubbo " ( " richest cop in the world " ) Gilbert the election for sheriff , and it helped defeat the whole Cook County Democratic machine in the 1950 elections , including Senator Scott Lucas , Democratic floor leader . A federal grand jury indicted Brennan , charging that he had impersonated a federal employee ( TIME , Sept. 22 ) to get the secret testimony . The Government 's first attempt to prosecute Brennan was thrown out of a Washington federal court two months ago because of " material defects , " e.g. , failing to say clearly whether the transcript was Government property or belonged to the stenographic service Brennan got it from . Last week the case against Brennan collapsed completely . The Government admitted in court that the weight of evidence against Brennan was " questionable , " and the case was dismissed .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
