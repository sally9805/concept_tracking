" Blessed be the queues , " said Juan Pern in a speech six weeks ago . At that time , meat , milk , beer , wine and fuel were scarce as a result of drought and the government 's economic mismanagement . The President 's idea was to convince Argentines that standing in line would assure them a fairer distribution of goods . <P> It did not work out that way . With tired , angry shoppers comparing gripes by the hour , the queues became the focus for popular discontent . Last week , before 500 leaders of the Peronista Women 's Party , Evita Pern , looking pale and thin after her operation , took back her husband 's blessing on queues and instead pronounced a curse . " Queues , " she said , " must be destroyed . We have to get control of the streets . We have to eliminate the enemies of Pern . " <P> Evita urged her party workers to visit homes and explain to housewives that if everybody would get along with a little less , shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She also urged vigilance against those " traitors " who blamed the shortages on the government . " I advise that note be made of overheard conversations , " she said . " I advocate using an espionage system such as that which Japanese embassies used to employ . " <P> As Evita 's eavesdroppers went out to their task , the police , complying with new orders from on high , began breaking up queues outside stores . Pushing through the crowds , they forced people to keep moving , scattered groups of gossiping housewives . The chief result seemed to be that some women &; children lost their places in line .
