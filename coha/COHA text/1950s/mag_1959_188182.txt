Christ cursed a fig tree , and in a matter of hours , says the Gospel of Mark ( 11:20 ) , it was " dried up from the roots . " The Rev. Franklin Loehr and his Religious Research Foundation in Los Angeles do not claim such dramatic results , but they are off to a flying start , as reported in a new book ( Doubleday ; $3.50 ) titled The Power of Prayer on Plants . <P> Presbyterian Loehr , 45 , was trained as a chemist at Illinois ' Monmouth College before he turned to the ministry and " religious research . " When he heard six years ago that Duke University 's famed extrasensory perceptionist , Dr. Joseph B. Rhine , was testing the effect of prayer on plants , Loehr and his associates bought two sealed jars of water , prayed hard over one , ignored the other , and used them to water two equal sets of seeds , planted under identical conditions . Two weeks later the prayed-over water had produced seven seedlings , the ordinary water only three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " writes Researcher Loehr . He began to set up more elaborate experiments . <P> A ten-inch , circular cake pan filled with earth was spun , and divided by a piece of lath . On each side of the barrier 23 kernels of corn were planted , and the pan was spun again to select the side to which " positive prayer " should be addressed . For eight days , prayer for growth was given to that side , prayer against growth to the other . Result : " Sixteen sturdy little seedlings greeted us on the positive side . On the negative side there was but one . " Against that stubborn seedling the experimenters directed " several brief ' bursts ' of negation-strong mental commands to grow no more . . . and it grew no more . The top of it darkened and withered and it remained in the stunted , non-growing condition . No more seedlings appeared on the negated side , though we held the experiment open for 20 days before digging , photographing and measuring each seed . Later one of the mathematicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick computation of the probability factor of this experiment . It came out over 2,000,000 to one . " <P> Like Dr. Rhine in his work on extrasensory perception , Researcher Loehr found that some people are better at it than others . One woman scored slightly lower than average in praying her seedlings up , but when she tried " negative prayer , " the seedlings showed hardly any life at all . " She was rather shaken by the experience , " writes Loehr , " but I am keeping her name and address on file . The time may come when those with effective prayer-negation power will be sought again for their healing help . " How does one go about praying negatively ? One experimenter resorted to calling her seedlings Communists . " To her that is an epithet of disdain , scorn and active dislike . Those poor seeds seemed to twist and writhe under the negative power showered on them . " <P> After more than 700 experiments conducted by about 150 people on 27,000-odd seeds and seedlings , concludes Experimenter Loehr , " our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference in the speed of seed germination and in the rate and vigor of plant growth . This in turn demonstrates two things : 1 ) that prayer is fact , and 2 ) that scientific laboratory research can be done in basic religious fields . "
