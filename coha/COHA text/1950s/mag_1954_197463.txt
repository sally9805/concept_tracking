When Small Business Administrator Wendell B. ( for Burton ) Barnes , 45 , was vacationing with his wife and four children near Jacksonville , Fla. a fortnight ago , Hurricane Carol began kicking up off the Florida coast . Right away , Barnes packed his family into the car and headed north . He reached his desk just in time . One of Barnes 's major tasks is to make emergency loans in disaster areas . The morning after Carol smashed across the New England coast , Barnes declared disaster areas in six states ( New York , Connecticut , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Maine ) . <P> Last week he opened emergency-loan offices in Providence , New Bedford , Mass. , four other hard-hit cities , and flew off to New England to check on loan requests . Among them : a Kittery ( Me. ) lobsterman wanted $1,500 to replace his lost boat ; a Providence clothing store wanted $10,000 to replace its ruined merchandise ; a New Bedford cotton mill wanted $75,000 to repair wrecked machinery . At week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for damage caused by Hurricane Edna ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . <P> After the Storm . Coping with disaster is an important but infrequent duty for Wendell Barnes , who heads the first independent agency in U.S. history to serve the nation 's 4,000,000 small businessmen . An Oklahoma attorney and ex-small businessman himself , Wendell Barnes took over last November from William Mitch ell ( no kin to Labor Secretary James Mitchell ) , whose tight-fisted policies had convinced businessmen that SBA loans were only for defense or what Mitchell considered " essential " civilian industries . <P> SBA helps businessmen in three ways : direct loans , getting Government contracts , technical and management advice . <P> Congress , in cheating SBA 14 months ago , set up a revolving fund of $80 million for loans . But SBA avoids competing with private bankers , keeps its interest rate at 6% ( v. about 3% for comparable private loans ) and advises every applicant to try local banks first . If the bank can take part of the loan , SBA will take the balance . Its requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but every borrower must prove his good character , have substantial money of his own invested , show that he can operate successfully . Says Barnes : " We do n't make a loan if there 's no chance for repayment . " In all , the agency has approved 731 loans ( less than half the requests ) for a total of $34,739,000 . <P> Too Many Mice . Congress also directed SBA to help small firms get a bigger share of Government contracts . The meas ure of its success is that , despite the decline of defense spending , contracts to small firms have been going up . To keep the small businessman abreast of good management techniques . SBA has also put out 53 booklets on topics ranging from " How to Build Your Sales Volume " to " Care of Hydraulic Systems . " * Staff specialists help with individual problems , e.g. , a paraplegic veteran looking for markets to unload his overproduction of white mice , a soda-fountain supplier looking for new confections to round out his line . <P> SBA has even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practical management . <P> <P> *A brassiere manufacturer , evidently under some misapprehension , wrote for the SBA pamphlet titled " Packaging Pointers .
