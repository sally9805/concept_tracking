One clear , cool evening last June , Diane and Herbert Rang were married in Los Angeles . After the ceremony at the West Adams Presbyterian Church , the young couple , both of Korean descent , led the way into an adjoining hall for the wedding banquet . There 300 guests sipped fruit punch and consumed platefuls of traditional Korean fare : tuna , popped rice , olives , tea and rice cakes . <P> Nearly a month later , a Los Angeles doctor stopped in to see an ailing patient . He quickly spotted some disturbing symptoms : high fever , intestinal pain , diarrhea . He ordered analysis of blood and stool samples . Back came confirmation of his worst fears : typhoid fever . Next day he found similar symptoms in a second patient . Thoroughly alarmed , he notified the Department of Health . <P> The department 's medical sleuths found that the two typhoid victims had but one contact in common : on a cool evening in June , they had both attended the wedding of Diane and Herbert Kang . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , the Department of Health went into action . Their quarry : the carrier who must have transmitted the typhoid . Five investigators and two nurses got in touch with all wedding guests they could trace , had them checked for infection . But many people at the party had just drifted in for the fun , and their names were unknown . As the investigators rang doorbells , three more guests came down with typhoid . <P> Health officials asked local TV and radio stations for help . Hourly appeals were broadcast , asking wedding guests to report for examination . Many of the guests had left town : some were as far away as Hawaii . By last week the number of typhoid victims had climbed to ten . One of them , eleven-year-old Tim Nahm , had died . Of the 300-odd guests only 231 were accounted for . <P> Then , on the third day of the search , health officials tracked down and isolated the infected carrier . They refused to give his name , announced only that he had handled the food served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of the disease in 14 years . Neither Diane nor Herbert Kang showed any symptoms , but the memory of their happy wedding was sadly marred.
