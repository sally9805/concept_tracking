THE EAST // At Philadelphia 's vast Municipal Stadium , craggy-faced Monty Stickles , a second-stringer who had failed in three of four placements this year from three yards out , kicked one from the 28 to give Notre Dame a 23-21 upset of Army in a spectacular renewal of the great rivalry ( see page 18 ) . // The unexpectedly rugged Dartmouth line , unscored upon in three games , had great fun at Hanover , pounced on fumbles , blocked a kick , scored a safety and cleared the way for 35-0 upset throttling of Brown . The Indians showed fair run-pass balance , scored twice by each route and once on a punt return . They now take over Brown 's erstwhile spot as next-best-to-Princeton .... // Which itself had the devil of a time in Palmer Stadium . Princeton called up desperate line play to repel a last-minute Pennsylvania drive and finally muddled through 13-9 . The Tigers ' heralded single-wing ground power was held in check , but they got maximum mileage from 89 passing yards , including one touchdown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games by the curious spreads of five , three and four points . // THE SOUTH // Georgia Tech , eagerly looking forward to this week 's outing with Auburn , was ambushed by LSU 's stabbing ground game 20-13 . Tech set up a defensive overshift for the LSU attack , saw it run asunder by Fullback Jimmy Taylor who blasted for 98 yards and three touchdowns . Sophomore Halfback Billy Cannon chipped in 90 yards , threw a vital pass and boomed two late-game punts out of bounds inside the Georgia Tech 10 . LSU , undefeated in Southeast Conference play , rides high now . They play neither Auburn nor Tennessee this year . // Auburn used two breaks to edge Kentucky 6-0 in one of the day 's bitterest battles . The two fought nip and tuck throughout the first half , were at it again in the third period when Auburn recovered a fumble on the Kentucky 30 . A roughing penalty against Wildcat Tackle Lou Michaels subsequently put the ball on the 6-yard line , and from there Auburn punched it over . // THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michigan State sliced up Michigan 's highly regarded line for a first touchdown , carved open the pass defense for two more , and went on to an awesome 35-6 dismemberment of a potential Big Ten giant . The Spartans showed off anesthetizing power in Halfback Walt Kowalczyk and lancelike passing by Quarterback Jim Ninowski , sending some 100,000 fans home wondering whether State might not be better than Oklahoma . ( see page 18 ) . // Wisconsin , no patsy itself , battered out more than 300 ground yards , won its third game , bouncing Purdue 23-14 . The young Badgers face a brutal coming-of-age this week at Iowa . // THE SOUTHWEST // After being thrashed 16 straight times in Waco ( dating back to 1904 ) , the Arkansas Razorbacks finally got sore , pounded their Baylor hosts 20-17 . Baylor , still numb from that bad night in Miami , could n't fathom the tactics of Quarterback George Walker . Walker passed only seven times but completed six for 101 yards and started a lateral-forward play for the second Arky touchdown . Baylor Quarterback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two touchdowns and 103 yards . // Oklahoma precluded fearful riots in Dallas by turning back the fired-up Texas Longhorns , who had held the national champs at bay for 44 minutes and 34 seconds . Jakie Sanderfer , a Texan by birth and Sooner hero for the day , cracked over for the third period score that put Oklahoma ahead . His interception of a Texas pass set up the final tally with less than three minutes left . Oklahoma won 21-7 ( see page 22 ) . // THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS Colorado 's slim Bob Stransky , the nation 's leading rusher , shaking off tacklers like so many sticks of straw , led the Buffaloes over Arizona 34-14 . Stransky , an alert stop-and-go halfback , ran 98 yards in less than three periods of play to up his total yardage to 467 . He also caught two passes and intercepted another . // THE FAR WEST With less than four minutes left on the game clock , Stanford did it again . It blew the big one , this time to Washington state in a semifinal Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had racked up a solid three touchdown lead in the first half , were coasting home 18-7 when the roof fell in at the tag end of the fourth period . On a stunning pass play from State 's 13 , Cougar End Jack Fanning took a throw from Quarterback Bob Newman and ran for his life to the Stanford end zone . Moments later , after recovering their on-side kickoff , State was zipping through the distraught Indians . In short order they scored , on a pass from Newman to End Don Ellingsen with 44 seconds left . Final : Washington State 21 , Stanford 18 . Should State get past Oregon next week and Oregon State on November 2 , the Rose Bowl bid will be virtually in the bag .
