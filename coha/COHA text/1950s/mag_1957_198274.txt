Ever since his short-lived freedom from Communist jailers during last autumn 's Hungarian revolution , Josef Cardinal Mindszenty has been living in the U.S. Legation in Budapest . Mindszenty , forced by Russian intervention to seek refuge , lives in a two-room apartment , gets his meals from the legation kitchen , works on his memoirs and takes infrequent strolls in a gloomy little patio in the legation compound . Though the legation keeps him supplied with newspapers ( including the Paris Herald Tribune ) , the protocol of diplomatic refuge forbids him to receive or send letters or to use the telephone . <P> Last week the Italian Communist Party organ Unita printed a dispatch from its Budapest correspondent suggesting that if the U.S. would request it , Hungary 's puppet Premier Janos Kadar would be happy to grant Mindszenty a safe-conduct allowing him to leave both the legation and Hungary . To these officially inspired Communist overtures , there was a noticeable absence of response by both the Vatican and his U.S. hosts . <P> U.S. officials say privately that Kadar wants Mindszenty to leave so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway . Kadar is also thought to believe that , with Mindszenty out of the way , the U.S. might be more inclined to send back a minister to replace Edward T. Wailes , who left Hungary two months ago on State Department orders without ever having presented his credentials . <P> Officially , the U.S. , which does not recognize the right of diplomatic missions to offer international sanctuary in the manner practiced so widely in Latin America , * has been fearful that the Communists might try to seize the cardinal by force . Last week 's feeler was welcomed in Washington as tacit recognition by the Kadar government that U.S. protection has been effectively extended to the cardinal . Unless he gets official instructions from the Vatican to ask for a safe-conduct-which seems unlikely-Cardinal Mindszenty will probably stay on in his present haven indefinitely . <P> <P> In New York last week , Anna Kethly , a Minister of State in the eight-day government of Premier Imre Nagy , reported that Nagy , now in a Rumanian prison , will probably be brought back to Budapest shortly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been brought back and lodged in Fo Utca Prison , Miss Kethly said , and their trial presumably will provide the backdrop for Nagy 's . Said Anna Kethly : " The Prime Minister is under great pressure to confess . A special investigation group was set up by the MVD and the AVH for this reason . Not only secret policemen are members of this special group ; it includes psychiatrists , heart and nerve specialists . They believe that under the pressures of their daily tortures the Premier will confess . I am absolutely sure he will confess . " <P> <P> * U.S. Foreign Service Regulations state : " As a rule , a diplomatic representative or consular officer shall not extend asylum to persons out side of his official or personal household . Refuge may be afforded to uninvited fugitives whose lives are in imminent danger from mob violence but only for the period during which active danger continues .
