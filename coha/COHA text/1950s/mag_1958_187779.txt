At the Pennsylvania National Horse Show in Harrisburg , West Germany 's fine jumping team was having things its own way last week . With only two competitors still to jump in the fault and out event , Germany 's Olympic Champion Hans Winkler , 32 , had cleared the ten jumps faultlessly in 38.6 seconds . Then a slim young Mexican girl galloped to the starting line , her dark hair bobbing out from under her black riding cap in a pert ponytail . Vicki Mariles swept her horse over the rail jump , safely navigated the spread jump , and swept past the finish line in an amazing 36.9 seconds to beat Winkler and win her first international trophy . <P> At 16 , Vicki Mariles is two years under the official minimum age for international competition , was competing only by courtesy of a special dispensation from the Fdration Equestre Internationale . But Mariles is no ordinary name in international horsemanship . Her father , Brigadier General Humberto Mariles , 45 , is one of the world 's great horsemen , helped make Mexico a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours Vicki and her older brother Humberto Jr. , now 18 , worked under their father 's exacting eye to master Mariles ' jumping style , in which the rider stays firmly in the saddle at the take-off point instead of lifting up to urge his mount over the barrier . <P> " Vicki , " says Papa Mariles , " she has a very strong character and lots of courage . Berto , he is more quiet , his trouble is he do n't turn the corners too well . Vicki , she turns those corners very well . She knows that is how you save time , but she still has to learn one important thing . You see , when a horse is racing fast , he flattens out across the jump . When he comes down , you have to encourage him a little-go ' Hah ! Hah ! Hah ! ' in his ear to help him go over the next jump . She do n't do that yet . " <P> The general obviously seeks perfection . But at show 's end , Vicki and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly creditable performance in competition against the world 's best horsemen . Father Mariles had obviously produced a pair of successors Mexico could be proud of .
