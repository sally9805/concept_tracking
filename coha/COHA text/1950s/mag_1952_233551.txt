As Cinemogul Cecil B. ( The Greatest Show on Earth ) DeMille leaned over the railing of the press gallery at the Republican National Convention last week , a reporter asked : " Does this look like the second greatest show on earth to you ? " " No , " replied DeMille good-naturedly , " this is the greatest . " And for the press it was . More than 3,000 newspapermen ( and 2,000 radio-TV men ) blanketed Chicago for the biggest , most elaborate coverage ever given any story . Pundits , Washington reporters , foreign correspondents , feature writers , women's-angle writers , columnists and " specials " of every stripe turned out more than 12 million words of copy . The coverage , newsmen agreed , was not brilliant , but it could not have been more comprehensive . <P> Guerrilla Warfare . So many topnotch reporters worked on every angle of the story that , as Herald Tribune Correspondent Bert Andrews pointed out , " there 's very little opportunity here for any exclusives . It 's just a matter of grinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort by those willing to take chances . The day the convention started , Editor Louis Seltzer of the Cleveland Press climbed right out on a limb with a Page One story headlined : IKE WILL WIN ON THE 3RD OR 4TH BALLOT . Two days later in Chicago , Publisher John Knight predicted in the Daily News that Ike would be the candidate and Nixon his running mate . If he was wrong , said Knight , he would " just have to go off fishing somewhere . " <P> Despite the numbers , many newsmen and photographers had a hard time covering the story . There were not enough badges for half the newsmen who wanted them . One newsman , told by Republican Chairman Guy Gabrielson that all his press tickets were gone , got some right away from Chicago 's Democratic Boss Jack Arvey . Terrible-tempered Columnist Westbrook Pegler was so outraged by the back-row seat he was assigned that he denounced the " leftwing standing committee that put me way out here in left field . " Snapped back Gallery Boss Harold Beckley , who also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could write the stuff he 's turning out from Baltimore . " <P> Clear the Floor . On the convention floor , newsmen often found the going rough . When U.P . Photographer Stan Tretick tried to take a picture of one of the delegates who had fainted , another delegate clouted him on the head and guards hauled Tretick off the floor . At one point , Temporary Chairman Hallanan called in sergeants-at-arms to clear the floor of newsmen entirely , but the order was reversed after an angry roar of protest . <P> There were other journalistic hazards far from the convention hall itself . A column by Scripps-Howard 's Robert Ruark ( " Doug was a dud as a keynoter " ) was stopped after it turned up alongside an editorial praising General MacArthur 's speech as " A Call to Arms . " Hearst papers killed a Pegler column saying Eisenhower is " a stupid man and I will do all I can to prevent his election . "                   @ @
