Members of Congress and others demanded Mr. Wilson 's resignation , and the President himself termed the statement " very unwise .

" And I assure you it is never going to be in this day of terrible weapons and the kind of warfare ' that places a premium on skill and discipline and training ? it is never going to be the kind of force we need until we get these recruits having at least six months of good hard basic training .
