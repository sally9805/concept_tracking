When U.S. composers set out to exploit uniquely native material , they all too frequently lose sight of the folk for the folksiness . Pulitzer Prizewinner Douglas Moore , 62 , a Columbia professor , has been a notable exception . At least one of his previous operas , The Devil and Daniel Webster , achieved an easy lyrical style which has kept it alive in repertory as an authentic domestic classic . For his fourth opera , premiered last week at the legend-laden Opera House in Central City , Colo. , Composer Moore once again mined some rich native lore : the story of Colorado Silver Millionaire Horace Austin Warner ( " HAW " ) Tabor and his blonde bride from Wisconsin , Elizabeth McCourt ( " Baby " ) Doe . The opera 's title : The Ballad of Baby Doe . <P> " This dramatic story , " says Composer Moore , " makes an ideal outline for an opera libretto . " He is right . Born in Vermont in 1830 , HAW Tabor caught the gold fever early , wandered with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prospecting . He made his big strike at Leadville when he was 47 ; within a year he was a millionaire . To help celebrate his new affluence , he gave Denver a magnificent Opera House with his name engraved on a two-foot block of silver . Librettist John ( Cabin in the Sky ) Latouche picks up the story from there . Tabor became the richest man in Colorado , and this attracted 20-year-old Baby Doe , who blew into Leadville in 1881 , established herself as Tabor 's mistress and persuaded him to divorce his wife . As an interim Senator in Washington , he married Baby Doe in a lavish ceremony attended by Congressmen , diplomats and President Chester A. Arthur himself . But when silver fell in 1893 , Tabor fell with it . <P> For the remaining six years of his life he eked out an existence as a postmaster and by the sale of his lavish possessions ( including his collection of $700 nightshirts ) . The story gets its special twist from the fact that Baby Doe remained faithful to him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Tabor 's last silver property in Leadville , rarely left the place and was found frozen to death there in a dilapidated shack in 1935 . <P> Out of this invitingly gaudy material Composer Moore has wrought a clean , melodious score which succeeds in conveying strong period flavor without being condescendingly folksy . Its melodic high spots include Baby Doe 's Willow Song , the stunning Silver Song ( sung by Met Coloratura Dolores Wilson ) and a moving choral , Lovely Evening . Sophisticated musically , the score nevertheless is marked by a clarity rare to the U.S. opera stage . " Most composers today seem to be writing under such influences as Schoenberg and Stravinsky , " says Moore . " I tried to return to melody as the key to communication . " Others will get a chance to decide how he has succeeded . Sold out for its 16 Central City performances , The Ballad of Baby Doe will probably be performed on Broadway in the fall .                  @ @ @
