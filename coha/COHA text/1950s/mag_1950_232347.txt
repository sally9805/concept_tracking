In 1948 , when General Motors Corp . and Walter Reuther 's United Automobile Workers ( C.I.O. ) signed a " cost-of-living " contract , both sides hailed it as a noble experiment in labor relations . Under the contract , the autoworkers got an 11 an-hour raise , plus an automatic boost of 3 an hour at the end of the first year . They also agreed that their wages should be adjusted up or down each quarter to compensate for sizable movements of the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' " cost-of-living " index . For a while , it looked as if the union had played it smart : three months after the contract was signed , it got a cost-of-living boost of 3 an hour . But after that , the autoworkers had to take two pay cuts totaling 3 an hour ( although they also got an equal increase last year under the automatic " improvement factor " ) . With each pay reduction , G.M. wisely made small cuts in the prices of its cars . <P> Last week , there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers . Because the B.L.S. index had declined 1.6 points , G.M. announced that it was lopping another 2 off the wages of 290,000 hourly-paid workers , and $10 off the quarterly pay of 72,000 salaried employees . As it had done before , G.M. simultaneously cut the prices of its cars-from $10 on Chevrolets to $40 on the most expensive Cadillacs . But the union no longer liked the double-edged sword . It announced last week that when the G.M. contract expires in May , it will wash its hands of the deal , go after a guaranteed annual wage instead . Cried Walter Reuther : " We 'll win it , too .
