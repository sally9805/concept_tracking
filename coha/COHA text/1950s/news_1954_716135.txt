txt Public housing costing a billion dollars has given this city 70,000 low-rent and medium-rent apartments since 1936 . Of these , 54 , - 000 have been built since 1946 , when the return of World War U veterans turned a serious housing shortage into a crisis . With projects under construction or approved , the total is expected to reach 103,753 in three years , as against 60,301 slum dwellings demolished . This publicly financed housing , along with 150,000 " post-war units built by private developers , some with indirect Government subsidies , has taken veterans ' families out of temporary barracks and quonsets . The City Housing Authority , landlord of all the dwellings built under the Federal , state and city public programs , was so deluged with applications from veterans who had to live with in-laws or who were separated front wives because of the housing shortage that no non-veteran families qualified for public housing in almost eiglit. years , except those whose homes were torn down for slum clearance or other public works projects . Now , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public housing for non-veterans other than those dispossessed from clearance sites . This is an indication of how the veterans ' problem has been eased , through the increase in public housing and the purchase . or rental by veterans of privately built Mmes . Last year , for instance , 5,686 families moved out of public housing projects , a tenancy turnover of 8.71 per cent . Some moved into higher ' - income public housing , but most of them went into private housing . Seven hundred and eighty // acres of the city 's Worst slums have been rebuilt with light , airy apartments under the public programs , which also have brought modern housing to the same number of hitherto vacant acres in the four boroughs outside of Manhattan . While the demolitions have eliminated less than one-tenth of the 9,000 acres officially designated as slums , they have cut out the " hard core " of block upon block of rookeries unit for human habitation according to present standards . The elimination of historic and infamous slums on the lower East Side , in Harlem , downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housing authority is finding few six-block and eightblock areas of solid slum remaining for the development of huge " superblocks " such as have provided most of the public housing to " date . Philip J. Cruise , chairman , is turning to four-block and two-block projects for much of the future attack upon the substandard housing that now disfigures better residential areas like pockmarks on a once-pretty face . Despite the notable improvement in the veterans ' lot and the demolition of the worst " hardcore " slums , New York 's overall housing problem is - becoming more difficult instead of easier . One of every five New Yorkers today is a slum dweller or lives in substandard housing in a deteriorating neighborhood . It was this condition Mayor Wagner had in mind when he declared in his " State of the City " message last month that " the worst blot on our city is its slums . " Peril of ' Creeping Slum ' The greatest danger in the housing situation toaay , is the " creeping slum , " spreading across formerly good residential areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large area west of Central Park , where brownstone family houses are being turned into furnished room clusters ; laundries and cheap music schools are encroaching on residences ; school buildings have become shabby ; garbage collection and street cleaning have deteriorated , and needed house repairs are neglected as middleincome families flee to the suburbs . Similar decay is in other sections of the city , which have not yet reached the full slum stage . A pilot study of an eight-block West Side area has been made by a special committee of the Citizens ' Housing and Planning Council , consisting of real estate men , city officials and housing experts . It shows that the area , with virtually no new construction , had a density ' increase from 13,900 residents in 1950 to 19,000 in 1953 . Ninety-four per cent of the former single-family homes and 17 per cent of the apartments had been converted to furnished rooms ; many single rooms housed families of three to five persons ; 71 per cent of the furnished units shared bath and toilet with one to six other families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings were in good repair ; and most units had minimum cooking facilities , usually a screened-off corner with an electric hot plate or gas burner . To clear the older slums and cut out the substandard housing that has infected larger areas . the city would need today 480,000 new dwelling units , according to Mr. Cruise . But nowhere near that number will be built in the next ten years , if the post-war rate of private and public housing is unchanged . The city 's population , meanwhile , is being swelled by 50,000 to 60,000 migrants a year , most of them in the lowest-income group . Planning Agency 's Estimates The City Planning Commission , taking a view , only slightly less alarming than that of Mr. Cruise , estirffates that this city will require construction of 438,000 dwelling units over a ten-year period . This calls for a construetom rate of 43,800 units a year , but city planners doubt that the rate for the next few years will exceed the average post-war rate of 30,000 units a year . The principal reasons for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private construction in the depression years and the virtual stoppage of building , both private and public , during the war . elThe continuing influx to New York of low-income citizens from Puerto Rico and the South . elThe marked inability of private builders to provide , . at present high costs of materials and labor , anywhere near the volume or kind of housing that is required . Mayor Wagner and Mr. Cruise are in agreement that much more public housing is necessary , in both low-income and middle-income ranges . They want more Federal , state and city funds . They agree also that private builders should be encouraged to go more extensively into middleincome rental housing , a field many developers have shunned . The city officials favor Government aid to private builders as well as to tenants  --  the kind of aid that has helped insurance companies , savings banks , labor unions , cooperatives and other builders put up 24,000 middlerent units . These privately built and operated developments are sometimes called " quasi-public " housing because of indirect subsidies in the form of tax exemptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Views of Realty Men Some real estate men are enemies of all public housing , but the major realty groups and large builders agree on the need for public housing at the present range of $9 to $19 a room . The major realty spokesmen say there must be a large amount of housing in this rent range and that they can not provide it . Clinton W. Blume , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , said : " The low rent public housing program does not offer competition to private enterprise . Without public housing no new accommodations would have been iSrovided in this category . " Declaring that private construction , without subsidies of any kind , would result in rentals " well over $30 a room , " Mr. Blume said there was a large gap between those rents and those of the public housing . Paul Tishman , president of Paul Tishman Company , Inc. , general contractors who have built some of the biggest private and public developments , said that the low- , est rental figure at which a private builder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low land subsidization would be $45 a room a month . He said that no ' builders were interested in providing housing at those rents without Government aid . Mr. Blume and Mr. Tishman agreed that the gap between the public housing rentals and those in which private capital was interested was a challenge to all concerned with the housing problem . The enmity ' among some real estate men toward all public housing is on a more localized basis . At last week 's hearing of the City Planning Commission , where a Bronx delegation objected to the proposed state-financed $19,946,000 Castle Hill project , Thomas J. Canning , executive secretary of the Bronx Real Estate Board , cried : " We are opposed to all public housing . Keep it out of the Bronx and keep it out of New York City ! " ? Two clergymen , who spoke at the hearing in favor of the Castle Hill project , said the objections were based on racial prejudice . The same sort of opposition , based on non-discrimination rules for public housing tenancy , has kept public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed against specific projects in several other parts of the city . The Castle Hill project , approved by the City Planning Commission , comes before the Board of Estimate next week for final action . The development cost of the ' seventy-four public housing projects currently tenanted or under construction here is $944,296,374 . This includes the 70,000 units built since public housing started on a small scale in 1936 , and 16,843 in the process of erection . Of those already completed 27 , - 000 units rent at $16.50 to $19 a room . The rest are low-rent $9-1a-room housing . The Federal , state and city projects have been built with Ifunds from bond issues , which are paid off from rental income . Cash subsidies from the three government levels make up the difference between , the low Irentals and the operating , maintenance and debt service costs . These subsidies have totaled $48,419,113 since 1936 . This figure represents the direct contribution by taxpayers to public housing . References to billions of dollars spent for public housing across the nation have , sometimse confused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldered the entire development costs instead of only the operating and debt service deficits . When the thirteen additional projects , which have been approved but not yet started are completed , at a cost of $227,957 , -1 000 , the score will be : Total construction cost , $1,172,253,374 , with the Federal program re sponsible for $417,244,420 of they housing , the state program for , $455,564,667 construction , and the city , $299,444,287 ; new units ) built , 103,753 ; slum units razed , 60,301 ; net contribution to relief ! of the housing shortage , 43,452 apartments . The trick of eliminating the overcrowding of the , slums and ! at the same time creating more dwellings than existed before is achieved in two ways . The new buildings cover less ground than the rookeries they replaced , but are taller . Half of the projects chaanvte labneedn built on hitherto vaLong before the projects now under construction or authorized are completed , the city expects to have additional developments approved under all three govern ment programs . One of the huge Government-1 aided programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Title I program di-I rected by City Construction Coordinator Robert Moses , chairman of the Mayor 's Slum Clearance Committee . The Title I program permits cities or local agencies to acquire slum properties and resell the assembled parcels at a loss ? sometimes half the purchase price ? to private developers , with the Federal Government paying twothirds of the markdown and the city one-third . ' Under this program , Mr. Moses has already mapped out nine such projects in Manhattan and two in Brooklyn , to provide 14,964 apartments to rent at $17 to $48 a room . They will clear 174 acres of slums . Demolition is under way at the Columbus Circle , Corlears Hook , Harlem , North Harlem , West Park , and **25;332;TOOLONG projects . Three other projects have been approved and two are in the planning stage . Wagner 's Plans Outlined Mayor Wagner 's plans to meet the housing problem include , besides more Federal and state aid , a local tax ' on telephones , legislation to permit more tax exemption and other aid to private builders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspectors from six city departments , to prevent further deterioration of neighborhoods by strict enforcement of - housing , zoning , sanitary , health and other regulations . The Citizens Housing and Planning Council feels the Mayor 's approach to the " creeping slum " danger is good but not good enough . Ira S. Robbins , executive vice president , has offered the Mayor the council 's suggestion for creation of a new city agency ? perhaps to be called , the Neighborhood Conservation Commission  --  which would , besides coordinating the inspectional and enforcement work on a permanent basis , lay out small parks and new schools for such areas , provide off-street parking , demolish unsafe buildings and study and recommend rezoning to prohibit intrusion of undesirable land uses .
