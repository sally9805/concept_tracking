Until he killed his parents last summer , Harlow Fraden was unable to work out any really satisfactory way of shaping his environment to fit his ego and personality . He tried immersing himself in poetry , but his mother-whom he habitually described to friends as " that hateful paranoid " - would have none of it . After he graduated from New York University as a chemistry major last June , she plagued him to get a job " like other boys . " Instead , Harlow-a tall , thin , languid youth with cropped red hair and heavy hornrimmed glasses-lounged about the family 's Bronx apartment , owlishly reading verse . Eying him , his mother bawled the word : " Fairy ! " <P> Harlow 's father finally told him to " get the hell out of the house " and to stay out until he had made something of himself . In a way this worked out rather well-as the youth might have guessed it would . His parents had alternately berated and pampered him all his life . When he was small , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribed other children to play with him . When he grew older , his parents bought an air conditioner for his bedroom , although they sweltered through summers without one themselves . When he set six fires in their apartment one night during his teens , they doggedly protected him from a suspicious fire marshal . <P> Having thrown him out , his anxious parents gave him $2,000 to make a start in life and sent him a liberal allowance . Harlow got a $215-a-month apartment on Manhattan 's East End Avenue , and invited a dark , handsome young man friend named Dennis Wepman to live with him . But after a while , his parents cut the allowance in another attempt to force him to get a job . <P> " Who Are You ? " That was pushing Harlow too far . and he decided that life would be much more attractive if his mother and father were out of the way . The elder Fradens lived simply and both worked-Mrs . Fraden as a $6,3OO-a-year teacher in the public schools , her husband , a physician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they had managed to set aside a considerable nest egg ; counting insurance , savings , pension benefits and some jewelry , they were worth in the neighborhood of $96,000-dead . Harlow found it ridiculously easy to kill his parents . <P> After careful discussion of the matter with Roommate Wepman , a Miami attorney 's son with vague literary pretensions , Chemist Fraden decided to use potassium cyanide as a terminal agent . One evening last August , he put a vial of the stuff in his pocket , got a bottle of champagne , called on his parents and joyously announced that he had got a job . He poured three glasses of wine , added cyanide to two of them , and asked his parents to join him in a toast to his future . They drank and toppled to the floor .
