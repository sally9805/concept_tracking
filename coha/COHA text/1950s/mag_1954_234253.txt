At a United Nations Economic and Social Council meeting in Manhattan last week , Soviet Representative Semyon K. Tsarapkin recited an old Communist charge : private U.S. investment abroad brings huge profits to the capitalist " exploiters " and retards the economic development of the foreign victims . Next day U.S. Representative Preston Hotchkis , a California insurance executive , answered Tsarapkin with a few facts and figures . <P> Tsarapkin had cited Latin America as a horrible example of how U.S. capitalists keep foreign nations from industrializing and force them to concentrate on production of raw materials for U.S. industry . Hotchkis answered that of the $441 million invested by U.S. citizens in Latin America in 1951 , half went into manufacturing industries . He reeled off a list of U.S. industrial investments in Latin America , from tires and chemicals in Brazil to glass and textiles in Chile . The U.S. Export-Import Bank , he added , has made loans to Brazilians and Chileans for steel and textile mills , to Mexicans for steel mills and chemical plants . U.S. experts have shown Cubans how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textile industry on the island . <P> In a bit of statistical sleight of hand , Tsarapkin implied that profits on U.S. private investment overseas average 85% , or $1.5 billion a year on a yearly investment of $1.75 billion . Hotchkis pointed out that profits are returned not on the current year 's investment alone , but on the total investment , i.e. , $1.5 billion on $16 billion , or less than 10% . On gross profits , said Hotchkis , the investors pay foreign taxes of more than 30% . Of the net profits , they plow back well over half - 62% in 1952-into reinvestment in the countries where the profits were earned . <P> For example , said Hotchkis , Sears Roebuck &; Co. " has invested over $28 million in five countries in Latin America since opening its first Latin American store in Havana in 1941 , With the exception of one small dividend from a Cuban subsidiary , every cent of profits earned between 1941 and 1952 was reinvested in the countries in which they were earned to finance new stores and new products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
