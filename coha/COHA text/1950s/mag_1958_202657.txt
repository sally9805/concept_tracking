Nationalist China 's tough old Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was increasingly impatient . <P> Three weeks ago , when Communist shells smashed an LSM on Quemoy 's beaches and left it a smoking wreck , Chiang made up his mind . Quemoy could never be saved by bigger and better convoys , he argued . Under the hail of Communist fire , the convoys could never be made big enough to keep the island supplied . The only solution , he insisted , was to knock out the Communist guns . He proposed to do it with Nationalist planes .

He also insists that the decision must come soon .

The first Red Chinese bomber shot down by U.S. planes would create new , and dangerously explosive , problems . <P> Chiang can not and will not do anything without U.S. consent . So far , the U.S. was not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sharp reminder that the West could not shelve or solve Quemoy 's problem simply by demanding that its defenders sit and take it ( see box , opposite ) , in a battle they could not afford to lose and were not allowed to win .
