There is an elderly lady , Mrs. Alice Smith by name , who has watched the Dodgers work out at Vero Beach for the last seven years . She wears a blue team cap which has always carried the letter B in white . This year she was offered a new cap with the letters L.A. on it . She said no , thank you . To her , the Dodgers will always belong to Brooklyn . // It is not so with others at the Dodger training camp . This year it is the Los Angeles Dodgers , and no one , least of all the players , seems upset over the thought that they will never again play baseball in Brooklyn . The talk is of California , of Malibu Beach and freeways , of the good weather and comfortable living . Even the clothing has a California look . // Ballplayers are always a well-dressed lot , but this year there seem to be more rich-blue sports shirts and cream-colored slacks than ever before . Buzzy Bavasi , in a white cardigan sweater and sunglasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' general manager . After practice one day , Don Newcombe ambled from the clubhouse in a snazzy red golf cap that produced whistles and catcalls across three baseball diamonds . // Following the Dodgers around Florida this spring , recording what they say , what they eat , how they feel and what they do , is an army of typewriters . There are spanking new green-and-white ones and they are from California . The black-and-gray ones are from New York . The California typewriters are covering their first spring training ; they are eager and excitable . The New York typewriters are covering their last spring training ; they are relaxed but slightly jealous . There is no ill feeling between the two groups , although it must be admitted that the green typewriters and the black typewriters have had very little to say to each other . // All thoughts and activities , however , have not been devoted to California . After all , there is a baseball season ahead . On the afternoon of April 18 , perhaps 100,000 happy souls will show up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball club for the first time . If their hopes are high , they may be disappointed . // Los Angeles acquired the Brooklyn franchise , all right , but it is not getting the Brooklyn team . Not the team that won six pennants in a decade . The Dodgers insist that theirs is not a wilting team . They point to their young staff of talented pitchers and explain that the team has simply undergone a curious metamorphosis . What was once a hitting team , they argue , is now a pitching team , and they are convinced that they can carry on as such . Perhaps , but other teams have had better pitching and have not won pennants. // The great Dodger team , the team Los Angeles fans read about in the papers and saw on television in the World Series , is gone . Some of the names are still there ; uniform No. 1 still means Pee Wee Reese , but Pee Wee Reese no longer means what it once did . The massive Don Newcombe still stalks the grounds like a giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dodger staff . He has slipped and he knows it , and so do National League batsmen . When Duke Snider swings at a pitch , players standing around the cage watch not the flight of the ball but the delicate left knee . And , of course , there are two members of that great team who will never play baseball in Los Angeles : Roy Campanella who won so many friends and Most Valuable Player awards , and Jackie Robinson who won so many pennants. // Yet do not believe that this first Los Angeles Dodgers team will be a poor one . It has the pitchers , headed by young Don Drysdale and Johnny Podres . Their pitches will be caught , in all probability , by someone now wearing another uniform . Cincinnati has turned down a Newcombe-for- Ed Bailey deal , but the Dodgers may get Bailey yet . They will have to get someone , for Rube Walker can not win them a pennant . The outfield will be Gino Cimoli , Snider and Carl Furillo . If Snider 's knee fails , Rookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodges will play first base . The rest of the infield is like a game of musical chairs . Charlie Neal will switch from shortstop to second base because the Dodgers feel he can make the pivot better than Jim Gilliam . Gilliam will switch from second to third because he is too good to leave out of the lineup . That leaves shortstop open . Many of the Dodgers feel there is only one man for the job and chances are when the season starts , he will be there . That man is Pee Wee Reese . // When the Dodgers lost Jackie Robinson they lost their spark . Last year 's team was listless . Now the spark is back in the form of peppery Charlie Dressen . When Dressen was last with the Dodgers it was 1953 and he was the manager . Now he is a coach , which puts the current manager , Walter Alston , a quiet , contemplative man , in an awkward position  --  like that of sharing an upper berth with your wife 's garrulous first husband . With the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more enthusiastically about baseball than Charlie Dressen . What 's more , he can be understood . Charlie is always ready with advice . Don Zimmer was swinging too hard ; Charlie told him to choke up on the bat . Charlie Neal is a good base runner but lacks polish ; Dressen is busy shining . Some of the Dodgers need an occasional kick in the pants ; Charlie 's right foot is poised . And when the manager is wondering who to pitch one day next August , Charlie will have a man in mind . His presence on the team will be of tremendous value . // Also of value will be the new setting into which the Dodgers will soon arrive . Playing in front of new and enthusiastic crowds may give the old pros a lift . The climate , too , should help . Los Angeles spring afternoons are warm and the summer nights are cool . Even the schedule is favorable . The Dodgers play their first 27 games in California . // One ca n't help feeling that perhaps this team could win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do get a first-rate catcher , maybe if Snider 's knee  --  but what 's the use ? It is always a sad , sad thing to have to face the fact that a beloved old champ can not come back .
