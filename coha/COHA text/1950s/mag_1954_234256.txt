Mortgages have always been hard to turn into cash . A mortgage-holder who wants to sell has to shop around among banks and real-estate brokers , often gets a poor price because of the suspicion that he badly needs cash . Harry Fromkes , president since 1949 of Manhattan 's big Lawyers Mortgage &; Title Co. , thought there ought to be a better way . In 1952 he opened a mortgage exchange where buyers and sellers could be brought together for private negotiations , but it soon died out . Last week he tried something new : a mortgage auction . <P> In a rose-draped hall in Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hotel , 69 mortgages went under the auctioneer 's gavel at the newly formed New York Mortgagee Exchange . Fromkes had expected sales of second mortgages to predominate , but almost two-thirds of the sales were first mortgages . More than 1,400 buyers and spectators jammed the room , and , all told , mortgages with a face value of $964,200 were sold for $821,045 . Banks that felt overloaded with mortgages and private holders who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but did better than by private sale ) . The auction went so well that Lawyers Mortgage plans a second sale early next month , may hold as many as two sales a month thereafter . As commission , the company takes 1% to 2% of the selling price , depending on the size of mortgage .
