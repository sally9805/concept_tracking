All week long the rumors swirled and eddied through the windswept streets of Montreal ; for one reason or another , by resignation , illness or dismissal , Msgr . Joseph Charbonneau was through as Archbishop of Montreal and chancellor of the University of Montreal . <P> In the welter of stories one hard fact stuck out : the white-haired , 57-year-old prelate had left his red brick palace and flown across Canada to the seclusion of a Catholic nursing home in Victoria . At midweek , an archdiocesan official confirmed his presence there " for a prolonged rest " ; Apostolic Delegate Ildebrando An-toniutti would add nothing more . <P> Titular Rank . Finally at week 's end came an announcement from the Vatican : Archbishop Charbonneau 's resignation-had been accepted " for reasons of health " and he had been named titular Archbishop of Bosphorus . <P> The news broke over Canada 's biggest ( 955,000 ) archdiocese like a stroke of midwinter lightning . But far from dispelling the cloud of rumors , it stirred up fresh ones . Among the most persistent : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instigation of Quebec 's highhanded , labor-hating Premier Maurice Duplessis . The two men had clashed sharply when Archbishop Charbonneau and the local clergy sided with members of the Canadian and Catholic Confederation of Labor in the bitter Asbestos strike ( TIME , Feb. 28 , 1949 et seq. ) even after the strikers barricaded the town and fought Duplessis ' police with clubs . <P> Painful Conflict . Though the Vatican termed stories of intervention by Duplessis " ridiculous , " its spokesman noted that the archbishop 's resignation " automatically dispels what had become a painful conflict of opinion between ecclesiastic and civil authority . " Msgr . Antoniutti , charged with settling the conflict , had put his problem to Charbonneau . The archbishop said he could not draw back from his pro-labor stand , but added that his health had been poor and that he had been intending to resign . Said the Vatican statement : " The greatest possible freedom was left Charbonneau in taking the decision , which was entirely his . " <P> Just how far the church cared to go in dispelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop Charbonneau 's successor . Meanwhile there were unofficial reports in Quebec City that a pastoral letter , signed by all the bishops of the province and approving the Social Action principles of Quebec 's liberal clergy , was being prepared for reading in the churches of the province within a month . That would strengthen the stand of such other pro-labor prelates as the outspoken Rev. Georges-Henri Levesque , dean of Laval University 's faculty of social sciences , Sherbrooke 's Bishop Philippe Desranleau , and Quebec City 's Archbishop Maurice Roy . <P> <P> * An unusual but not unheard-of practice in the church . Resignation from an administrative or ecclesiastical function usually does not change the priest 's church status or his hierarchical rank .
