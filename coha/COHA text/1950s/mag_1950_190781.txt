On a hot July morning in 1943 , Yvonne , Comtesse de La Rochefoucauld , 41 , and her handsome ex-cavalry-officer husband met for the last time outside the Cercle des Officiers in Paris . They pretended not to know each other . The Gestapo had arrested all but one of the British officers who belonged to the countess ' intelligence group . London had ordered her immediate return to England . The count whispered : " I must embrace you once before you go . " " We are in public , " Yvonne said . " It is forbidden . " Before she walked on , Bernard had just time to reassure her that the family jewels had been taken to a safe place . <P> That night the Gestapo arrested Comte Bernard de La Rochefoucauld , descendant of Franois Due de La Rochefoucauld , Cardinal de Richelieu 's great rival . Next morning the Germans picked up Yvonne before she could escape to England . <P> A Pile of Corpses . Yvonne was taken to Ravensburg concentration camp . For insubordination , she received 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sadistic quacks in the Ravensburg Experimental Station . Eight injections of poison in her right eye blinded it . Other injections destroyed the hearing nerve in one ear . Then the Nazis injected typhus into her blood to make serum . In the typhus block they did not bother to feed prisoners . The countess ' last memory of Ravensburg was of feebly trying to fend off a ravenous woman prisoner turned cannibal . Two days later Yvonne awoke in Sweden . The Swedish Red Cross , accompanying Allied liberation troops , had found her among a pile of corpses . <P> Yvonne returned to Paris in November 1945 and tried to reassemble her life . Comte Bernard had died in a German prison camp at Flossenburg . The La Rochefoucauld chteau in Normandy had been bombed and burned . France had awarded Yvonne the Croix de Guerre with three palms and star for her war work . From England came the King 's Medal for her work with British Intelligence . But the countess was hard up . Although she held a medical degree from the University of Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Over &; over she tried to puzzle out where her husband had hidden the missing family jewels , valued at 100 million postwar francs ( about $286,000 ) . <P> A Bill of Sale . Early this month another former concentration-camp victim gave Yvonne a tip . The name Yvonne gave to the police was that of one of France 's best amateur horsewomen , the Comtesse Fides.de Marliave . Comte Bernard had known the Comtesse de Marliave casually before the war at the very smart riding club , Cercle de l'Etrier.
