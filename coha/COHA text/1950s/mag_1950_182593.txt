Lederle Laboratories developed aureomycin , an antibiotic , to treat such human ills as whooping cough , typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever . This week Drs . E.L.R. Stokstad and T.H. Jukes of Lederle told a Philadelphia convention of the American Chemical Society that aureomycin has an unexpected non-medical talent : it makes domestic animals grow faster . <P> The Lederle scientists were working on vitamin B-12 ( another growth promoter ) , one of whose sources is the fermentation product from which aureomycin is separated . To their astonishment , they found that this material had more effect on the growth of chicks than pure vitamin B-12 itself . When they investigated , they found that the small trace of aureomycin in the mixture was responsible . It worked with turkeys . It also worked with hogs , speeding their growth into marketable chops and bacon by as much as 50% . <P> Drs . Stokstad and Jukes do not know why the antibiotic is also a growth stimulant . They do not think it functions as a vitamin . More likely , they suspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful effects on the animal 's nutrition . They hope that it may prove valuable in treating some types of human malnutrition .
