Like their British comrades , Germany 's Socialists are opposed to Western European union-unless , of course , such a union could be dominated by the Socialists ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . In Bonn last week , German Socialist Leader Kurt Schumacher gave the reasons for his party 's stand . He also furnished his audience with an interesting insight into the workings of the Socialist mind . <P> Up before the Bundestag was a three-month-old invitation to Western Germany to join the Council of Europe . Still weak from a bout with the grippe , Chancellor Konrad Adenauer made his points a little wearily , like a grandfather repeating a self-evident lesson . Said he : " I do not think that the Western Allies will regard a refusal to enter the Council of Europe as a mark of our friendly approach . . . The Council of Europe is a first attempt to unite Western Europe as a federation . If the Federal Republic refuses to participate , the Council of Europe is finished . " <P> Then Schumacher rose to the attack . By joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would serve notice that it had finally abandoned its 17 million East German brothers to Red rule . Schumacher in advance suspected a united Western Europe of turning into a neutral bloc , which would try to concentrate on its own affairs , fail to carry out a vigorous political offensive against the Russians in Eastern Europe . What was needed , said Schumacher , was not a united Western Europe but a united Europe-with a united Germany at its center . But he failed to say how he would achieve this end in the foreseeable future , or how a disunited Western Europe would aid the worldwide fight against Communism . <P> Adenauer , like U.S. policymakers , argued for a limited but possible aim : Schumacher talked himself into the position of wanting all or nothing . After heated debate , the Bonn Assembly sided with Adenauer , voted 220-152 to join the Council . Said Konrad Adenauer exultantly , " Germany 's road to Europe is now open . " Wrote French High Commissioner Andre Franois-Poncet in a letter to Adenauer : " I am convinced this step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of solidarity among the European nations .
