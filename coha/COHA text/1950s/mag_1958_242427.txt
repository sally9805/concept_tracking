The more than 350,000 Algerians who live and work in France may want to stay out of their homeland 's troubles , but they are not allowed to . Scores of them have paid with their lives for refusing or failing to contribute to the F.L.N. ( National Liberation Front ) . An estimated 95% of them now pay up . Last week , in a series of well-planned and devastating acts of sabotage , the F.L.N. terrorists turned , not upon their fellow Algerians , but upon the French themselves . Even as Premier de Gaulle pleaded his cause in Algeria ( see above ) , the two-year-old F.L.N. threat to " carry the war to France " became-at least for a while-a grim reality . <P> At 2 o'clock one morning , a Renault Frgate drew up before the main motor pool of the Paris police , and four Algerians jumped out . They killed the sentry outside , burst into the guardroom , shot three more policemen , then tossed homemade bombs into the depot 's gas tanks . A few minutes later , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Paris . At Vincennes , a group of Algerians , attacking a munitions factory , killed one policeman and wounded another . <P> Outside Paris , terrorists sabotaged the railway at Salbris , fired gasoline depots near Le Havre and in six different places in the south of France . In Toulouse , 300,000 gallons of gasoline burned up . Near Marseille , firemen fought a gas fire that was to last all week . <P> All police leaves were canceled , and for the first time since the Communist riots of 1947 , the army was called out to guard " places of strategic importance . " In metropolitan Paris the police in one day rounded up 3,000 Algerians and commandeered the Vlodrome d'Hiver , the Madison Square Garden of Paris , as a detention camp . <P> While President Ren Coty angrily denounced the " abominable " acts of sabotage , F.L.N. leaders in Cairo and Rabat proudly declared themselves the authors of the terror . Rebel Leader Ferhat Abbas , once regarded as a moderate among the rebels , promised more sabotage . Fearing De Gaulle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to stir up enough hatred and dissension to make a mockery out of all talk of " fraternization . " <P> Last week Algerian rebels even threatened to sabotage French ships and planes everywhere , pointedly warned foreigners to cancel their reservations . " How far is the F.L.N. willing to go ? " a TIME correspondent in Rabat asked F.L.N. Leader Abdelhamid Mahri . <P> " As far as necessary . " <P> " To Nasserism ? " <P> " The United States might consider itself fortunate if we went only as far as Nasserism . " <P> " How much farther can you go ? " <P> " Use your imagination . If I have the choice between extermination and Communism , I will choose Communism . "
