Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> Of all the Western scientists who have rustled into the folds of the Iron Curtain , few vanished more completely than Italian-born Nuclear Physicist Bruno Pontecorvo . In late 1950 Pontecorvo , his head and perhaps his luggage crammed with hydrogen-bomb secrets gleaned from his U.S. , Canadian and British research , landed in Helsinki without a Finnish visa . He cheerfully surrendered his passport , was not impolitely detained . Within an hour , Pontecorvo , his Swedish-born wife and their three children dropped out of sight . But passengers on the airline bus which had hauled the Pontecorvo family into the Finnish capital recalled that , as the bus entered the city , one of the scientist 's little sons had ingenuously piped : " Are we now in Russia ? " Last week , after more than four years of rambling speculation about his whereabouts , Bruno Pontecorvo , 41 , could at last publicly answer the youngster 's query , " Yes " - with a vengeance . In a bristling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England because of " the sugar-coated blackmail of the police , " found asylum in the U.S.S.R. , where his brain had dwelt on " atomic energy for peaceful aims . " He also sprang a surprise : he had won a secretly awarded Stalin Prize last year . Later , Pontecorvo , proud occupant of a Moscow flat and a country villa , waved a Soviet passport before newsmen and cried : " I am a Soviet citizen ! " <P> At a fancy chuck wagon parked near Palm Springs , Calif. , rugged Cinemactor Clark ( Mogambo ) Gable and his old-time playmate , sometime Actress Kay Williams Spreckels , fifth ex-wife of Sugar ( Honey Dew ) Daddy Adolph Spreckels II , lined up for morning chow . With other early risers of the Desert Riders , oldest galloping group in those parts , they had just taken a constitutional in the saddle as dawn peeped over the oasis . <P> In 1950 , wanderlusty Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , world tramper and traveloguer ( Of Men and Mountains , Strange Lands and Friendly People ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks of northern Iran . Suspecting that Douglas , from his lofty perches , had stolen a peek or two northward , the Russians promptly and peevishly accused him of spying on them . Now , however , unpredictable Moscow is willing to let him look around some more . This summer , accompanied by Democrat Robert F. Kennedy , counsel to the Senate 's Government Operations Committee , Douglas will enter Russia from Iran , reconnoiter by car through six Soviet republics in central Asia . <P> In Manhattan , over a Scotch-and-milk , tousled Author James T. ( Studs Lonigan ) Farrell confessed that religion scares him mostly because he can not visualize any hereafter to his liking . " If I were to go to Heaven , " he explained wryly , " I would find my sainted mother nagging my father , and my grandmother bawling out my grandfather . And both ladies would be telling the Lord how to run things . On the other hand , if I go where I should go , I would find my aunt chasing the Devil as always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
