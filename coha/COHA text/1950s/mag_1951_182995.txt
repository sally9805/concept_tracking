Storm Warning ( Warner ) . A traveling dress model ( Ginger Rogers ) stops off in a Southern town to visit her married sister ( Doris Day ) . She hardly sets foot on the town 's strangely dark and empty main street when she stumbles on a violent scene : a sheeted mob of Ku Klux Klansmen hauls a man out of jail , beats him , shoots him down on the sidewalk . <P> Ginger is the only witness to the murder , and almost the only one in town who might dare to testify against the high-riding Klan . But when she meets her brother-in-law ( Steve Cochran ) for the first time , she recognizes him as one of the murdering Klansmen . Buffeted by her sister 's pleading , the Klan 's threats and pressure from a Klan-busting prosecutor ( Ronald Reagan ) , she must decide whether to join or break the town 's scared conspiracy of silence . <P> Storm Warning skillfully exploits this situation both as exciting melodrama and as a frontal assault on the KKK . Shrewd Producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even palatable , to most Southern moviegoers . To do so , he passes up chances to give authentic flavor to the movie 's locale . Though the town is identified as Southern and looks realistically lived in , none of its citizens speaks with a Southern accent , and nothing about the appearance and customs of the town or its inhabitants sets them apart from California or the Middle West . <P> On the positive side , the picture makes its prosecutor-hero a native son who argues pointedly , as many Southerners do , that the town must clean up its own mess if it wants to avoid interference from Washington and points north . The " outsider " who is killed by the mob is a crusading newsman who works for a paper no farther away than a large Southern city . Though they want to suppress the scandal , the town 's respectable citizens are opposed to the Klan . <P> The local mill-owning Klan bigwig ( Hugh Sanders ) is pictured as a cynical racketeer fattening on the dues and fees of an ignorant rank &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cochran , bullying and toadying by turn , creates a picture of an ugly , slack-witted Klansman . Storm Warning hits hard at these characters . By knowing when to feint as well as when to punch , the picture loses no excitement , gains a chance to make its message connect where it will do the most good . <P> I 'd Climb the Highest Mountain ( 20th Century-Fox ) , the sentimental story of a circuit-riding parson in a 1910 Georgia town , is made out of the same cloth as Stars in My Crown ( TIME , Jan. 8 ) . A narrator 's voice strings together a rambling account of rural joys , sorrows , faith ; some of the incidents and characters ( e.g. , an epidemic , a greedy general-storekeeper ) directly parallel the earlier movie , and again they are all designed to warm the heart .
