At Brown University in Providence , R.I. , one day last week , a tall , studious-looking man of 40 was escorted into Manning Hall for the purpose of being formally " introduced " to a special meeting of the faculty . Actually , no introduction was necessary : everyone in the room knew Barnaby C. Keeney as the able onetime dean of the Graduate School , and since 1953 the dean of the College . This time , however , Keeney had a new title . " With enthusiastic unanimity , " the university 's corporation had just elected him to be the successor to retiring President Henry Wriston ( TIME , April 11 ) . <P> It was , as blunt Henry Wriston said , " an admirable appointment . " A tough-minded scholar with often unattainably high standards , Barney Keeney has long seemed marked for success . At the University of North Carolina he was a star trackman and the top student in his class . After taking his Ph.D . at Harvard , he joined the faculty , was one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after Pearl Harbor , he enlisted in the Army , and because of his fluency in French and German , was eventually assigned to combat intelligence . To those who had known him before , it came as no surprise that he won the Silver Star for ( among other things ) advancing under heavy fire with three enlisted men to capture a forward enemy observation post along with nine enemy soldiers . <P> Though an erudite specialist on the 13th century , Keeney proved early that he was a talented administrator . But more important , he also turned out to be much the same sort of plain-speaker as Henry Wriston . He railed against students who shun controversy for fear of losing some future Government clearance ( " If silence is the price of Government service , it is too high a price to pay " ) , and against scholarly stuffiness ( " It must clearly be understood that the scholar does not lose dignity by being intelligible " ) . He is also a relentless crusader against the growing theory on many U.S. campuses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocrity . " It seems to me , " he once said , " that the colleges in this country must once again begin to teach college work and to require college performance . . . The scramble to get into college is going to be so terrible in the next few years that students are going to put up with almost anything , even an education . " <P> Last week he told his faculty that he had no " dramatic " plans in mind for Brown ( 3,600 students , 450 on the faculty ) . But he has made himself one promise that , if kept , will make him a rare sort of president indeed . " In 1949 , " says Keeney , " Provost Paul Buck of Harvard wrote me that I would do all right as an administrator as long as I continue to think as a professor . That 's the spirit in which I intend to carry on . "
