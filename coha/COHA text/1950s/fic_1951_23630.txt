The Snowfield A Story by Victoria Lincoln I N A room of hideous disorder composed largely of tangled wires , apple cores , mateless socks , and small parts of disintegrated machines , Todd Davenport lay upon his bed . One of his hands , big as a truck-driver 's , at sixteen , and dirty , held a quarter of a pound of American cheese , the other a battered book . His square jaws worked steadily as he read , his square brow , beneath the rough black shock of wiry hair was serene . It was a Saturday morning , and Todd was enjoying himself . " The two-quantum state of linear oscillation in any direction , " he read joyfully , " will be represented by the following eigenfunction . . . . " He sighed gently , breaking a large chunk from the cheese . His eyes continued down the page to the happy ending . " It is easily verified , " they rejoiced , " that the angular momentum has the values 2h , 0 , and minus 2H for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His square , dark face grew still , but with a stillness strangely qualified , like the thin alabaster mask of a boy lighted from within by the leaping and shifting of a wild flame . Pure intelligence possessed him , clothing and capturing each lovely vision of congruence or incongruence , of necessity . The still mask broke suddenly to a broad grin . " Neat , " said Todd aloud . " Ve-ry neat . " His mind , with an exquisite sense of satisfaction , now closed itself to speculation . Heturned upon his side , his eyes coming to rest upon his mountains , Everest , Chimborazo , the Jungfrau , Ranier , torn roughly from old copies of Life and the National Geographic and thumb-tacked to the wall beside his bed . He sighed , allowing the wordless images , the sensations to overcome him like an amorous dream . Chimborazo . . . above the timber line , across the snowfields , into the unclouded , brilliant , bitter world where powdered snow stung on lips and eyelids ... and up . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran down the stairs and out to the barn . He walked back into the dark box stall where , a week before , immediately upon their arrival at this new place , he had stored his tackle . His father was a painter , and a man of restless disposition ; they were always moving about but Todd had developed a gift for preserving , in those departments of his life which were most important to him , a certain continuity . ? Ropes and blocks , steel hooks , a pair of the spurs worn by telephone linemen : two covered wooden feed boxes and a line of harness pegs held it all in exquisite order . Todd , indeed , led two separate lives . The cluttered bedroom housed his mind , and his mind supplied its only order . But the box stall was different . It belonged to his body , and in a very practical sense . His life depended upon its adequate functioning . He now strapped to his left wrist his latest invention , a small grappling hook made from a three-pronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tree surgeon 's safety belt . He lifted a coil of rope over his shoulder , tested its weight , and exchanged it for another ; and grave , his face serious with a still , animal rapture quite unlike that stillness of the alabaster mask before the flame , he walked out into the yard and circled the house slowly . " I 'm a bird , " he said aloud . " I 'm a plane . I 'm super-Todd . Up , up and away . " The arm with the claw swung high . " How 'd I have managed on a house without lintels ? " he reflected , pausing for a moment , flylike , at the level of the second story . He cast with a light rope to the gutter , ten feet above him , remembering to distribute his weight between rope and rain-spout. . . . the gutter was n't any too darn strong . .. and horribly , like a sequence from one of the old Harold Lloyd movies , he continued his ascent . Now the uppermost ridgepole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He stood upright on the sheer drop of the roof , feeling the ridged soles of his sneakers cling . He walked up the shingles and sat against the ridgepole , his back against the chimney . He was slightly winded , just enough to find it pleasant . He stretched his body in the sun and closed his eyes . " Everest , " he thought . " Chimborazo . " He felt wonderful . I T WAS around noon when Todd swung down from the roof and replaced his tackle neatly in the box stall . He walked into the kitchen . His mother was standing by the stove . Her hair was quite gray and her face quite middle-aged , but she was still a beautiful woman and his father 's only model . Todd smiled at her fondly . " Listen , it 's too nice to stick around for lunch . I 'm going to make a sandwich and walk around . " He thrust the sandwich into his pocket and went out through the orchard and over the open meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his skin like a nervous quickening . More and more , he thought . Three times now this week , I 've got it . This feeling of MAGAZINE something terribly important going to happen to you . . . . Something going to happen beginning right now . He climbed a stone wall , pushed between bushes , and found himself on a path descending onto the ravine which separated their house from the farm on the further hill . Directly before him a fair , plump girl was walking very slowly , moving in the same direction as he , her head bowed . She thinks she 's all alone , his lips said soundlessly . She thinks she 's all , alone . And again the extraordinary sensation swept over him , the sensation of importance , of time pregnant and inexorable . Crazy , he said to himself . He quickened his step . Crazy , his lips said again . And still , as he moved quickly forward to the girl 's side , the same curious sensation persisted in his chest , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so moving , he was compelled , and knew that he was compelled , to sorrow . And , in a moment , it was gone . " Hello , " he said , and his voice was as he felt , friendly and matter-of-fact . The girl turned her head , a startled animal motion . " Did n't you hear me ? " he asked . " I broke through the hedge like a cow . " At once she smiled , a soft-lipped , open , childlike smile . " I must have been thinking . You the boy that moved in up at the other place ? " They faced each other on the path . She was tall , a shade taller than he , and except for the straight , fair hair wound in a heavy braid about her head , she was not pretty . Her nose was too small and shapeless , her upper Iip too short , her teeth uneven . And still there was a grace about her , a softness that was more than the soft parting of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , infantile freshness of her skin . Todd regarded her gravely . He never observed personal detail . If he had been asked to describe her in that moment he could have said nothing more than , she 's tall , sort of a little fat , she has yellow hair . And still , he was conscious of a grace , a softness , a recognition . He spoke almost as if he were speaking to himself . " You must remind me of someone , " he said . " I keep having a feeling that I 've seen you somewhere before . " The girl 's blue eyes , still with that startled , suddenly wakened look , lifted to his own . " That 's funny , " she said . " I felt the same way when I looked at you . Only I knew it was n't so . You being city people , I mean . " T HEY began to walk along the path to- gether . The small brook that flowed down the ravine beside them widened , became a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch or two beneath its surface . The leaves had not yet begun to fall from the trees above them ; the sunlight came through in thin , bright shafts that broke and rippled on the water . " This is the best place down here , " said the girl . She sat upon a flat rock and indicated another near it . " Let 's watch the skater bugs . " He settled himself , seeing the light shift and change upon the water . " Watch their shadows on the bottom when they go across the bright patch in the middle . " They were comfortably silent . " I saw you out of my window , " she said , after a little . " With a pair of old field glasses we 've got . What were you doing up in the roof , fixing a television or something ? " -I just like to climb things . " " Honestly ? " " Sure . To keep in practice for mountains . " A curious excitement flared in the blue eyes . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A real one with snow on it ? " " Once . In the Sierras , a couple of years ago . I was with my father and he does n't care about it so much , and of course I was just a kid , fourteen . We did n't do anything fancy . " " You 're my age , then . Sixteen . " " Almost seventeen , a few weeks . Are you in my class ? I have n't seen you . Are you in the county high ? " " I 'm not in school . " The words short . " I 've been sick . " The words , the voice so changed , become at once so dull and so abrupt , disturbed him unpleasantly . He pushed the uncomfortable feeling aside , questioning her without tact , like a young child . " What 's the matter with you ? " " I had rheumatic fever . I have to be careful not to tire my heart . " He was surprised at the strength of his response ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're getting better , are n't you ? " " I guess so . I do n't have to stay in bed much , ever , any more . " Her voice was withdrawn , flat and chill , nearly indifferent . " Well , that 's good . " But she spoke again . And once more her voice was changed , become joyful and urgent . " Tell me about the mountain , " she said . " What was it like when you got to the top , in the snow ? Have you got any special one you want to climb ? Go on , tell me ... . " He was overwhelmed by the bright , leaping life of her face . He stared into it and heard his own voice begin to speak , very slowly . " Well , " he said , " it 's in South America , my particular one . It stands by itself , right up into the sky . , . . " We could climb it together , he thought suddenly . When she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , bright as the sky behind the peak drew his voice on , " . . . Then you come to the snowfields . . . . The glacier comes down over there , and you think you can see the summit , but it 's only a shoulder , and another comes up behind it . . . " Quiet , not touching , they sat together in the place where before he had always been alone . The snows of Chimborazo lifted their untrodden stillness above them . I N THE days that followed , they fell , casually and comfortably , into a way of setting a new meeting time at each parting . " See you tomorrow aft , if it does n't rain . " Or , " I 'm sticking around school tomorrow to see the game . Want to come down Thursday , same time ? " The sky had looked misty one day when they had known each other for less than a week . " S'pose I wo n't see you for a while if we get a wet spell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually , " I 'll stop off at your place , " a veil fell over her face and she replied , " I guess not this week . No , I do n't think it would be such a good time for you to come by , this week . " And once , a little later , he said , " Why do n't we go up to the house , and I 'll show you my climbing stuff ? " And again , the veil fell . " Well , it 's a pretty far walk , " she said . But neither time was it really important . Maybe , Todd told himself , her family were the kind that were cautious about having much to do with strangers ; some farm people were like that . Maybe she was just shy . It did n't really matter . They could see each other all they wanted to the way it was . It was late in October when they sat by the side of the pool on a Saturday morning . They had been talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old white horse that he had seen wandering about on the slope by her house , she told him , was really hers . Her father had always said so . " Her name 's Polly . I used to ride her bareback before I got sick . It would n't do me any hurt now , she 's so old and good ; but they wo n't let me . " " Bologny . You traipse up and down hill , do n't you ? " " They do n't know that . I sneak around . I go awful slow , anyway . Even before . . . . Well , I always hated it up on the flat . Everything up there all looks just the same . " " Well , is n't there someplace you could take the horse where they would n't know it ? " But Ellen 's face changed at the question . It turned heavy , with that same look of petulant withdrawal that it had worn on the first day , when he asked her why she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " There might be something to it , what they say . It might set me back . And I 'm in such a hurry . To be real well , Todd , I mean , not just all right . I 'm in such a hurry . " And as she spoke , the look of apathy , of withdrawal , was lost in another , a look which Todd 's mind unwillingly clothed in words . Like someone running down the platform in a station , he thought ; running , still running , when the train 's already gone . His heart constricted and his mind snapped shut like a spring lock . His voice jerked with anger . " Nuts . They 've just got you scared to breathe . Let 's v.-1k about something that makes sense , for a change . " A ray of light passed between the moving leaves , shone upon the crown of her head , the crossed braids of her yellow hair . She looked directly into his face for a moment , MAGAZINE and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me about Chimborazo , like the first time . I love its name . " " So do I. " He lifted his head , thinking . " Well , look . First we 'll take pack ponies and go quite a way up the base . And then .... " Her face followed the direction of his eyes , as if they turned together toward the peak . They were quiet and at one again , lifting their faces to the high , distant reaches , to the regions of snow . B UT when he had left her , when he was alone again , the picture that he had forced from his mind returned . Again and again , through the rest of the day he thrust it from him and again and again it came back with a wretched persistence . Ellen had looked at him , and her face had been like the face of someone running , running for a train that is already lost . Just before dusk he walked once more through the orchard , down the slope , and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , although he knew that she would not be there , and twice he called aloud as if she might be somewhere ahead of him . " Ellen ! El-len ! " Then he turned back , following the ravine on to the break in the hedge where she always said good-by . He had no intention of going to her house , of seeking her out ; the walking , the calling had been no more than an odd , half-unconscious pantomime of his unrest . And still , he pushed through the hedge , and stood for the first time upon the Tucker land . At the foot of the pasture slope , an old white horse was standing near the hedge . One of its eyes was milky , and its head hung as if it were nearly asleep . " Polly ? " said Todd gently . " Polly ? " It let him approach , indifferently . It let its soft muzzle be stroked , its neck scratched . Its coat , surprisingly , was well curried , smooth to the touch , though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's voice spoke , almost beside him . " Evening . " " Good evening , sir . " - A thin , middle-aged man stood beside him . He wore jeans and a denim work shirt , and he carried a lead-rope in his hand . " Boy from the other place ? " " Yes , " said Todd . " You 're Mr. Tucker ? " " Yep . " He clipped the lead to the horse 's halter . " I stick her in the barn , nights it looks like rain . She 's like me , not gettin ' no younger . " He spat on the ground , absently . Then his hand went to his pocket and returned with a plug of tobacco and a knife . " Dirty habit , " he remarked . " Took it up because it do n't smell on you like smoke . The wife 's pretty strict on smoking and like that . " He hesitated and then cleared his throat . " Guess it ai n't much like that , over to your place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " Mr. Tucker spat again , rather shyly . " Artists , " he said . " I always understood they had a pretty easy way of looking at things . You know , free to come and free to go , and parties with the models and stuff like that . " His sad eyes lighted from within as he spoke with a strange , selfless lighting . Todd laughed . " Only in books , " he said . Mr. Tucker was clearly depressed . " The models , too ? " he asked . " They kind of strict , too ? " " I do n't know . Father never has anyone but Mother . Right now he 's painting her lugging a tub of water . " " You do n't say , " said Mr. Tucker . " You do n't say . And me and the wife thinking there was high old times just over the way . " He sighed . " Guess life ai n't ever much like the books , is it ? " Todd opened his mouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . " Well , " he murmured after an instant , " I guess I ought to be heading home . " Mr. Tucker expectorated his tobacco , picked a swatch of grass , wadded it , and stuck it in his mouth . " Takes off the smell , " he said . " Wasteful to chew so short , but it 's better than nothing . Well , nice to of met you . " H E TURNED away , leading the old horse . But before he had taken many steps he turned back . " Say ... say , wait a second , would you ? " Todd pushed back through the hedge , startled . " It 's about Ellen , " said Mr. Tucker . Todd caught his breath . " She told me about it , talking to you up on the road , " said Mr. Tucker . " She knows I 'm not strict on boys and stuff like that , the way her Morn is . " Still Todd could not speak . " She do n't have much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the yellowed teeth . " I . I 'd like her to have as much pleasure as she 's capable . " " Yeah , " said Todd . " Yeah , I know . " " Well , I got this idea . . . . And now I 've seen you and found out something about you , you might say . well , it 's like this . Ellen mentioned you was great on algebra . " " What ? " " That 's what she ca n't keep up on herself . We had a woman to tutor it , but it come too high . Suppose I was to let on to the wife your teacher or someone told me you was willing to do it for thirty-five , fifty cents an hour , what would you say to that ? " " Ellen . . . " said Todd . " Mr. Tucker . " She do n't aim to be superstitious of people , the wife , " said Mr. Tucker . " If I told her we 'd got a wrong idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... with bad weather coining on .... " He jerked the halter and the old horse lifted its well sleeked neck . " Well , " he said , " do n't get your hopes too high . " He spoke almost as if he were talking to himself , and walked off without waiting for an answer , his body moving at a curious , shambling gait , a sort of slow trudge . Todd stood perfectly still where he had left him . He did not know what he felt . He only knew that in a queer , unpleasant way this sad , half-ludicrous man who was Ellen 's father had made her real to him in a way that she had never been real before , in a way that he was not yet prepared to face ; and he was conscious of a desperate longing to run after him , to shout , " No ! No , Mr. Tucker , I ca n't do it . I wo n't come ! " After a long- time he passed his hands over his face in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of a boy . Then he shook his head . " Nuts , " he said . ' ' What 's the matter with me ? I 'm going to go home and read . " He walked quickly back to the house , as if he had a sufficient but limited time to make an appointment , and went directly to his room . He threw himself down on his bed . " Oh , damn , " he said to the empty room , " I left that everlasting book out in the barn . " He turned upon his side so that his eyes rested upon the picture of Chimborazo tacked to the wall . But it was not Chimborazo that he saw . A HEAVY autumnal rain set in the next day and continued into the day that followed . By afternoon it had turned to a light , blowing mist . She wo n't be down there today , Todd told himself all the way home from school . Not in all this wet . He had crossed the field and walked almost the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the pool and knew that he had known , all along , that she would be there . She was not looking back along the path by which she had come . Under the thick , pale crown of her hair , her face was soft and empty , the parted lips slack , the eyes wide and undirected . She came , his mind said but she thought I would n't come . He spoke quietly , not to startle her . " Hello , Ellen . " She did not start , but in an instant she was changed , the life leaping into her face . " I did n't figure you 'd be here , " she said . Her voice was warm , her head high and proud . " It 's nice out now . " He spoke vaguely , his eyes on her face . " Mom went to Archerville , or I could n't of got out in this damp , " she said . She paused , then spoke again , her voice abrupt . " My Dad knows I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The word drew itself out in a queer sound , reluctant , slow , almost indifferent . " He told me about he saw you and the idea he had . " Words that he did not expect burst from him . " Listen , are n't things all right the way they are ? Just the two of us , down here , without a lot of people messing in ? " " I guess so . " But she turned her head from him as she spoke . " Only for winter coming ... and . . . and wanting to keep up in school ... and the hill being sort of a far walk . . . . " Her voice , humble and uncertain , disturbed him . Women ! he thought furiously . Women ! He stared at the fair head , the averted cheek , hating that humbleness , that shocking vulnerability . " Okay , okay , " he said . " It 's all right with me . " She kept her face turned away , and her voice was still low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd ? After supper and time for the dishes ? " " Sure . " As if they had met to conclude a business matter briefly and the business was now done , they turned and began to walk back along the path . They did not speak again until they came to the break in the hedge . " Well , tomorrow night , " he said then . " Around six-thirty , quarter to seven . " " Todd ? " " What is it ? " " I do n't know . It was nice , was n't it , just us here , like you said , and nobody messing in ? " " Sure . I guess you 're right , though , it 's all to the good , snow in a couple of months , and all . " " But we 'll come down here , too , wo n't we , and talk about the same things ? Chimborazo and all ? " " Oh , sure . " " When it 's nice out , I mean . Well , good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gesture of farewell , and made as if he would turn away , but he stood still , his eyes following her , until she had gone halfway up the hill , walking slowly as she always did . There 's just one thing we 've got to do , he told himself slowly : stick to the algebra up there and keep the ravine for really seeing each other . If we do that it will all stay the same . It wo n't mess anything up . He drew a deep breath . That 's all we have to do , his mind repeated . Perfectly simple . Should have thought I 'd have seen it from the start . S TILL , when he walked up the steps of the Tucker house , that next evening , there was a nervous tension in his arms and chest . He blew out the hurricane lamp that he carried and rang the bell . Almost immediately , Ellen answered the door . " Hello , " she said . " Are you the boy to teach me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rapid , without meaning , as if she had been rehearsing the - words too long in her mind . He had been forewarned , but it was not what he expected . He was always oddly surprised by deceit . " Yes , " he answered . " I 'm Todd Daven-port . " His discomfort brought the words shy and strange . A born actor and intriguer could not have bettered the effect . A curious look flashed across Ellen 's face , a look of surprise and relief , but not of happiness . " Weil , " she said . " Come in . " She turned her flushed face over her shoulder . " Mom , " she called . " The boy 's here . " There was a firm , heavy step behind her . Todd lifted his face and looked at Ellen 's mother . She was not as he had imagined her . She was taller and heavier than he had expected , and her hair was not dark and graying but smooth and fair , like Ellen 's , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was even featured , the eyes still , the lips unsmiling . " Evening , " she said . Her voice was a little flat , without warmth but not unpleasant . She turned her head toward the back of the hall and spoke , increasing the volume of her voice without raising the tone . " The boy 's here , Dad . " Mr. Tucker came into the hall . He was taller than his wife , but beside her he looked wispy and unstable , and his sad eyes shifted uneasily from Todd 's face to Ellen 's . " Well , hello there , " he said . " All set to be a teacher ? " The false heartiness of his voice accented both the restless eyes of amateur conspiracy and the odd , powerful impression of his wife 's quietness . " Lem , " said Mrs. Tucker , " you sure you got it fixed with this boy about his pay , thirty-five cents an hour ? So he understands from the start ? " Mr. Tucker 's leathery skin darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-five , fifty , something like that , " he murmured . " Sort of left it to the boy . " " Thirty-five , " said Mrs. Tucker . " That 's what we can afford . " She spoke toward , rather than to , Todd , and exactly as if Mr. Tucker were not there . " He 'd leave a tip in acafeteria if you did n't watch him , " she said . " Just to make himself big . More scared of what folks think than he is of debt , that 's what it is with him . " Ellen , like her father , had a flushed , averted face . Todd , alone of the three , was oddly unembarrassed . This was as he had made up his mind that it should be , a business arrangement . Neither was he , despite his own gentle feeling , disturbed by Mrs. Tucker 's rudeness to her husband , so impersonally was it spoken , so without malice . " I 'll take thirty-five cents , " he said clearly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have far to come . " " Come into the parlor then , " said Mrs. Tucker . " No need to waste any more time . Lem , you may as well stay in the kitchen and hear the radio . Keep the door shut on it . " She walked before them without glancing back , her step heavy . Todd followed her , deeply struck by that curious impression of her moral certitude . His own character , so direct and directed , responded to it , not in friendship but with the steadiness of a well-armed peace . She seated herself squarely in the middle of a hard sofa backed with a frame of carved roses . She indicated the golden-oak table beneath the chandelier . An ornamental lamp on an embroidered mat had been pushed to one side of it to make room for the textbook , the pencils , and the paper which had been ranged upon it with the order of an operating MOM . Todd sat down , and for the first time since Mrs. Tucker had approached him , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blue eyes looked frightened . Mrs. Tucker appeared to have no further interest in either of them , but she made no motion either to relax or to busy herself . She merely sat , erect and quiescent , as if she were waiting for a train , with her hands , which were coarse and formless like Ellen 's , but without their softness of texture , splayed open upon her lap . The blood flickered beneath Ellen 's cheeks , and her uncertain eyes , turned from her mother 's view , lifted to Todd 's as if they begged for recognition . Todd lowered his own to the table , fingering the pencils before him , feeling his heart suddenly fill and ebb . A prison silence was in the room . The situa-tion was distasteful , alien to his temperament . He was physically conscious of the girl as he had never been before , while at the same time he felt a cold , undirected anger . He turned it from Ellen as best he could . That fool Tucker , said his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared his throat . " Well , " he said , where do we begin ? Suppose you tell me how far you 've got . " She pushed the book toward him . " About half , " she said . " Only I was in and out a lot , and part of the time the teacher was a substitute , and maybe I do n't understand any of it good . " She does n't like this either , thought Todd ; and on top of it all she 's afraid I 'll think she 's dumb . He hesitated , looking down at his hands . He felt an absolute necessity to reassure her , to communicate with her ; but they were watched , attended , and he had no subtlety . He was surprised beyond measure when suddenly he knew just what he must say . He lifted his face and smiled at her , directly , for Mrs. Tucker to see . " Weil , then , " he said , " I guess we 'd better start at the beginning . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was startled by the beauty of light that flooded her face .

It 's . . . it 's to get into college . . . . " " That 's right . " He spoke slowly , careful to betray no disappointment . " Why do you use letters ? " " I ... I do n't know . " He began to think , not of her , or of Mrs. Tucker , or of the three of them together and their anomalous position , but of the problem in hand . He felt a freeing in himself , a quickening . The muscles of his face relaxed and his look became neither kind nor careful but still , and lighted from within , as it was when he lay upon his bed and visualized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ellen . " His voice was happy and remote . " What is a proportion ? " She knew the answer to that . The words rattled . " The product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes .

I mean they are n't all littled down the same amount . " He moistened his lips , thinking . " Suppose you were making a picture of a man and a girl , half size . How big would they be in your picture ? " " Three and two . " " Six is to three as four is to two ? " " Why , yes . " He pushed a pad an pencil toward her .

" Well , I will say you earn your money , young fellow . The woman we had never kept her at it like that . " He turned his eyes to Ellen as if he had not seen her for a long time . " I tired you , " he said abruptly . " You look tired . " She was white , and her face , bent down above the shining golden-oak table , had a queer , frightened , unguarded look of weary disappointment , like a child 's . " I 'm not tired , " she said . " I learned an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and she knew it . And again the new , sharp , physical awareness of her body stung his body , and the prison atmosphere thickened in the room . He felt Mrs. Tucker 's eyes upon him and controlled his face . His mind formed words : You 've got to the foot of the mountain , now . They would comfort her , they would warm her cold cheeks , but he did not trust his voice to speak them . " Well , cheer up , " he said , " no homework till we get a little further . " Mrs. Tucker went to the mantel and took down her purse . " Here 's your thirty-five cents , " she said . She hesitated , regarding him with that strange , unsmiling , almost childlike look , as blind as justice and as assured . " I thought of raising you to fifty , " she said in her flat , rather loud voice . " There 's no nonsense to you , and I could see what you were getting over , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better to have you oftener , say three , four nights a week . You willing , that is . " He took the money in his hand and stood looking down at it a minute before he pocketed it . He heard Ellen behind him , pushing back her chair and standing up . It was a clumsy , tired sound . Everything had gone as he had intended that it should , as lie had planned it ; and yet he knew that everything had gone wrong . He felt tired himself , and stupid , as if the thick , cold prison air had slowed his blood and his mind . He was conscious of Ellen standing behind him , of her soft body , her weary , disappointed face . " It 's up to you , " he said helplessly . " Only . . . only I would n't want your daughter to get discouraged with too much work right at the start . I ... I get so interested myself , I tire other people out , I guess . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you want to go to college , do n't you , Ellen ? " She did not speak unkindly , but it was clear that the decision rested with her alone . " Same time , then , day after tomorrow , " she said . She walked into the front hall and opened the door . " Good night . " " Good night , Mrs. Tucker , " said Todd . " Good night , Ellen . " He did not look at either of them again . He walked quickly down the front stairs , the unlighted hurricane lamp in his hand . The clicking of the spring lock in the door behind him sounded like the springing of a trap . He made his way to the road and walked along it . She expected that it would be different , he thought . She knew I forgot her . His mind turned back to Mrs. Tucker . I do n't believe she 'll stay in the room after this , not all the time . She thinks she 's got my number . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's something else . As if she had ideas of good and bad in a terrible way that left people right out of it . They 're crazy if they think they could ever put anything over on her . They 're crazy to try to fool her the way they do . A shudder ran through his shoulders and lie jerked his head . " The thing is , " he whispered , " that Mrs. Tucker 's more like me than they are , and I hate to know it . " Suddenly he began to run , stumbling , along the dark road . Ellen , he thought . Ellen , Ellen . He saw her fine hair in its loosening braids , the flushing of the delicate skin , the soft lips loose-parted above the small , uneven teeth , the body soft with adolescent hunger and too little exercise . He saw her as if she stood before him in daylight , clearly , painfully , without softening of phantasy . Ellen , Ellen , and he ran toward home as if he ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beautiful . Mrs. Tucker had shown her to him that night as she was , weak , unstable , clouded in mind and in purpose , helpless as a child ; and Todd ran down the dark road , all love and all desire , as if he ran into her arms . The world would never be the same for him again . UT she was not in the ravine the next day , or the day after that , and when Todd walked down the dark road that evening carrying the lamp , his face was set . Even if Mrs. Tucker stays in the room , he thought , I 'll have to find some way to make it different . It 's not anything I can do , or say either , like that thing about the mountain . It 's a way I 've got to be in myself , knowing what she 's like and not forgetting her . If I really feel it , she 'll know , without my trying to find ways to tell her . She 'll know , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , seeing the soft face with its intense , unbeautiful changes of color , the flushing , the pallor . He saw the anxious , vulnerable eyes . Why do I have to know she cares about it so much , he thought wearily . I never knew things like that about people before . Why do I have to know she cares about it so much ? He blew out the lamp as he turned in at the gate . He set it down upon the steps and rang the bell . He could hear it sound within the house harsh and raw . Then there were several seconds of silence before it was followed by a heavy footfall . The door swung sharply inward , and Mrs. Tucker stood framed in it , blocking his entry . " Ellen 's sick , " she said . Her loud , flat voice was empty of expression , but her face was somewhat diminished from his memory of it , less full of inhuman certitude . " Sick ? " He heard his voice flat and empty like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just so 's to need bed-rest a couple of days . That 's why she do n't go to school , you know . She 's doctorin ' for her heart . " He could not keep the shock from his face . Mrs. Tucker laughed shortly . " I 'd ought to learn better than mention what ails her , " she said . " Do n't know why you ca n't never say a heart condition without everybody 's got her dug right under . Long 's she do n't shove herself , it ai n't nothing . Getting better all the time . " Her voice grew louder as she spoke , but the same oddly diminished look was on her face , and her thick fingers straightened and flexed by her sides as if they had a life of their own . Todd looked at her , the icy knowledge moving quietly into his blood . It 's worse than Ellen thinks or Mr. Tucker thinks . The doctor tried to fool them all , but he could n't fool her . She knows . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow , the immobile features , the cold , strong face ; and suddenly , fiercely , he was aware of a strength that was greater than this woman 's strength , hot against her chill , an extraordinary surplus of life , a power of out-flowing love . " Okay , " he heard himself say . " Will you let me know when to come back ? " An odd half-smile of approval moved Mrs. Tucker 's lips . " I 'll be by or send Lem , " she said . And then , with uncharacteristic awkwardness , as if the act of paying a compliment were foreign and surprising to her : " I like to see a kid that do n't make a song and dance out of nothing . " Still the hot , flowing strength upheld him . " Okay . Thanks . " He nodded and turned down the stairs . He struck a match to the lamp once more . " Too bad you had the trip for nothing . " The words came after him with an unfinished sound , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , but when he turned his head she had shut the door without further farewell . H E WALKED out into the road and along it . The muscles of his face were set , ' and his hand tightened upon the ring of the heavy lamp until the metal bruised his fingers , but he did not feel it . The strange , fierce emotion still poured from him in a living openness more terrible than grief or joy . He thought only of Ellen , with an intensity of realization so consuming , so overwhelming that he had no identity with his walking body , no future and no past . It was as if the knowing that Ellen might die had brought him only a total realization of the present , and of her alive . Ageless , neither a boy nor a man , simply a life opened to a life , he moved in his undirected and stumbling body through the darkness . It was not until he had gone for some distance that his mind wavered , his face broke , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen , apt for no tragic greatness , uncertain and unarmed . His lips moved , forming silent words . She 'll be all right , they said . Of course she will . He began to run in the dark . As he ran , he remembered Mrs. Tucker in the doorway , her restless fingers , her immobile face . Words broke from him aloud , aimless , angry words . " The old bat , " he gasped as he ran . " The damned old bat . "
