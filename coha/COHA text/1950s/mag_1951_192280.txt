With a hefty , two-handed swing , the wife of Senator Tom Connally last week smashed a magnum of California champagne against the bow of the biggest , fastest , most luxurious ship ever built in the U.S. Then , before 10,000 flag-waving spectators at Newport News , Va. , the 51,500-ton , 990-ft . United States was " launched , " i.e. , she was towed from the flooded drydock in which she was built ( she was too big for the ways of any U.S. shipyard ) into the James River , and gently nudged by twelve tugs to her finishing pier . <P> By next summer , the United States Lines will put its superliner-now 70% completed-on the transatlantic run . Third largest passenger ship in the world ( behind the Cunard 's two Queens ) , the United States will carry 2,000 passengers and a 1,000-man crew at better than 30 knots , and her builders think she can crack the Queen Mary 's transatlantic record of 3 days 20 hr. 42 min . Said Vice Admiral Edward L. Cochrane , Federal Maritime Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are playing again in the major league of the North Atlantic . " <P> Hard to Sink . The United States narrowly missed being finished as a troopship . Only a change of heart by the Defense Department last fall ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) allowed her to be fitted out as a civilian luxury liner . But Naval Architect William Francis Gibbs , who devised the mass-production method of building the Liberty ships , planned the United States so that she can be converted in a short time to carry 14,000 troops . Below decks the United States has the same watertight compartments which make Navy ships hard to sink . To keep the ship fireproof , no wood has been used " except in the pianos and the butcher 's chopping blocks " ; all the paint is fire-resistant , and the furniture is stuffed with spun glass . <P> Helping Hand . To the Europe-bound traveler , however , the United States will look as luxurious as any ship in the world . Among her features : 2 2 public rooms , two theaters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokestacks , largest ever built , have fishtail fins to waft the ship 's exhaust away from the sports and sun decks below . <P> The ship cost more than $70 million , with the Government kicking in $42 million to help pay for the military features and the extra cost of building her in an American shipyard rather than in low-cost foreign yards . The United States will also get a subsidy from the Government , possibly up to six figures a year , to make up the difference between U.S. operating costs and the average operating costs of foreign competitors .
