In the inevitable involvement of its military strength and influence in the everyday life of the free world , the U.S. has long sought to define a legal relationship between the rights of American servicemen stationed abroad and the inherent rights of allied nations . The U.S. 's principal instrument : a worldwide network of more than 40 " status-of-forces agreements " designed to legalize the status of 700,000 U.S. servicemen in friendly countries . The status-of-forces agreements-roughly granting to U.S. military courts the right to try G.I.s for on-duty offenses , granting to the host country jurisdiction over off-duty offenses-have worked out in a way that has become one of the wonders of international law ( TIME , June 17 ) . One day last week , in a decision that could well rank with other legal history shapers , the Supreme Court ruled 8 to 0 in effect that the status-of-forces agreements are constitutional . <P> A Right to Decide . The decision was handed down in the headlined case of Army Specialist Third Class William S. Girard , 21 , who shot and killed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rifle range in Japan last January . The sharp issue was whether the Administration had the right to decide - as it did decide-to grant a Japanese request for jurisdiction over Girard under the status-of-forces agreements . Federal District Judge Joseph C. McGarraghy had held that since Girard acted while on duty , he had a constitutional right to a U.S.'court-martial ( TIME , July 1 ) . The Supreme Court cut through the on-duty , off-duty argument , simply ruled that the Administration had discretionary authority to waive jurisdiction at will , because the agreement with Japan was legally drawn , and nothing in the Constitution or the public law infringes upon it . " The wisdom of the arrangement , " said the court , " is exclusively for the determination of the Executive and Legislative Branches . " <P> The Supreme Court went all the way back to an opinion written by John Marshall , the third Chief Justice of the U.S. , to uphold the Administration 's law foundation for the status-of-forces agreements . Paraphrasing Marshall , the court said : " A sovereign nation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its borders unless it expressly or impliedly consents to surrender its jurisdiction . " Marshall , C.J. , stated this as a legal absolute . <P> An Exemplary Case . The Girard decision brought few all-out editorial huzzas , plenty of jeers . The internationalist-minded Baltimore Sun approved the decision , but blamed U.S. administrative bungling for failure to give Girard full benefit of the status-of-forces agreement . The Hearst New York Journal-American thought that " the basic rights of this American soldier have been violated . " New York 's tabloid Daily News roared that the Supreme Court , " like Pontius Pilate . . . has washed its hands . . . This stinking affair has disgusted tens of millions of us . " The News admonished Congress to get busy with remedial legislation . And Ohio 's Senator John Bricker telegraphed to every Sunday paper in his home state his renewed determination to fight for his Bricker amendment , which would " make the Constitution supreme over the conflicting provisions of any treaty or executive agreement .
