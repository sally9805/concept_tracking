Shakespeare , who grumbled that " the fashion wears out more apparel than the man , " would have had much more to complain about in the 20th century , in which fashion wears out fashion . Only last fall , Paris Fashion Czar Christian Dior flatly decreed the " H " look for women . Indignantly rejected by U.S. women and their admirers , the bosomless H yielded last spring to Dior 's full-skirted , slim-shouldered " A " line , which treated the bust as poor but honest . <P> Last week , as Paris couturiers ended their fall showings and went on vacation , the dominant new look was Dior 's " Y " shape , a broad-shouldered , high-waisted evolution of the tunic , which recognizes the bosom for what it is . This " sheathier sheath , " as Vogue calls it , was either starkly simple or loaded with as many optional extras as a new automobile . Items ( see cuts ) : a Dior coat shaped like an upside-down Coca-Cola bottle ; a Dior maternal-looking midriff in a Y evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derrire drawstrings ; Givenchy 's sausage-sleeved street dress . <P> How much does this Parisian alphabet game influence the $8.5 billion-a-year U.S. fashion industry ? More than ever , says David Nemerov , chairman of Manhattan 's Russeks , one of the first stores in the country to get Paris copies on its counters each season . " There is tremendous interest in what Paris does , " says Nemerov . " Otherwise , we would be featuring uniforms . " Most buyers were enthusiastic about the Y look . In one of their most successful seasons ever , the big salons were picked as clean as bargain basements . <P> Of more than 1,000 buyers who attended the Paris showings , 140 represented U.S. concerns . Many were there to pay up to $400 for an original suit or coat ( considered successful if it sells to 100 buyers ) , as much as $3,000 for such creations as Balmain 's elaborately embroidered Versailles evening gown . Reproduced under license , they will eventually reach smart fashion stores across the country . But U.S. fashion experts do not make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They go to scan the new silhouettes , get ideas for accessories , materials and colors ( black will be their favorite color this fall ) for adaptation to low-priced lines . <P> In a year or so all but the most extreme French ideas introduced in the past month will have filtered down from fashion 's summit to U.S. closets . They will be modified in the filtering , but their effect will be there . When Paris comes out with anything as easy to take as the Y shape , it immediately has " a big influence , " admits Edwin Goodman of Manhattan 's high-fashion Bergdorf Goodman . He adds : " But you wo n't get any American designers to admit they have copied anything . "
