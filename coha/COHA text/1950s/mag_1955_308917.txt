Senator J. William Fulbright 's investigation of the stock market , which had some suspiciously political overtones from the start , last week turned into an out-and-out dogfight between Democrats and Republicans . G.O.P. Chairman Leonard Hall charged that Committee Member Paul Douglas of Illinois was " one of the original instigators of the gloom-and-doom attack " during the last congressional campaign , and that one of the star witnesses , Harvard 's Professor John K. Galbraith , was an " oldtime New Dealing , A.D.A.-type of anti-Jeffersonian radical who flirted around with the customary pink fronts , " and " almost wrecked " World War II 's Office of Price Administration . <P> There was no doubt that the hearings were generating so much more heat than light that Chairman Fulbright himself admitted that the whole affair appeared to be " futile . " Then he helpfully translated just what he meant by " futile " : " We are in a box . If any good comes out of these hearings , the credit redounds to the President rather than to us . " <P> 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McChesney Martin Jr . of the Federal Reserve Board , watchdog of the nation 's credit and onetime president of the New York Stock Exchange . Previous witnesses , notably Harvard 's Galbraith , had testified that margin requirements should be raised , perhaps as high as 100% . Did Martin agree ? He did not , since credit denied to the market would just move into other fields . <P> Next witness was Treasury Secretary George Humphrey , who had been following the hearings closely . Humphrey decided that it was time to read former College President Fulbright ( University of Arkansas ) a little lesson in economics . Humphrey was frankly worried about the effects of the investigation , feared it would affect confidence in the economy as a whole as well as the market . The market , said he , is a meeting place of the ideas of millions of people . " Confidence is a subtle thing . It is built slowly and can be easily and quickly shaken . . . Confidence-or lack of it-has more to do with the conduct of investors . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned . " Do you think we should discontinue these hearings ? " he asked . Said Humphrey : " I do not think I would care to advise this committee on what its functions are and what it should do . " New York 's Republican Senator Irving Ives wanted to know if Humphrey had heard " anything today about " a stockmarket crash . Said the Secretary : only " in the hearings of this committee . " <P> Humphrey was joined by Indiana 's Republican Homer Capehart , who had been needling Fulbright from the beginning . Said Capehart : " The series of questions that we have had in this committee have all tended to be on the negative side , and have tended to prove that stock prices are too high and that maybe we are just a few steps behind a crash such as we had in 1929 . " Said Fulbright : " It is very inappropriate to engage in bickering with you before this audience . " Replied Capehart : " You started it ... You . . . stick to your knitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered sarcastically : " The Senator always adds a great deal to the dignity and intelligence of our hearings . "
