Before the House Ways and Means Committee last week was a sensemaking Administration proposal to make immediately available to the states an estimated $587 million for extending the unemployment compensation of eligible unemployed whose state payments had run out . The bill would cover expirations during the 15-month period from last Jan. 1 to March 31 , 1959 . It would extend compensation 50% longer than the maximum time allowed by state law , ranging ( depending on the states ) from eight to 15 weeks . It would advance to the states the necessary funds but require that the money eventually be paid back to the Federal Treasury . <P> Then , out of the pocket of Rhode Island Democrat Aime Forand came another proposal hastily whipped up by his fellow Democrats on the committee . The new draft served as a practical demonstration of the poles-apart recession philosophies of the Eisenhower Administration and many congressional Democrats . The Democratic proposal extended the expiration period to 24 months , beginning last June , when the recession was a pup . It provided a flat 16 weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified that the states need not repay the Federal Government . And to it , committee Democrats added a special fancy fillip : eligibility would be extended beyond the 3,400,000 workers now covered to include 900,000 seasonal workers , fishermen , government employees and the like who do not qualify for compensation under present regulations . Total estimated cost in unrecoverable funds : $1.5 billion to $2 billion . <P> Committee Republicans were aghast . Wisconsin 's John Byrnes , with considerable accuracy , called the program a " new dole " which " goes far beyond the wildest dreams of the New Deal and Fair Deal . " New York 's old Dan Reed grunted that it was " panicky political irresponsibility . " But on a key vote-whether to include the additional 900,000 unemployed-the Republicans lost to the committee majority , 14-7 . In losing , however , they had solace . If the bill 's final draft clears the Ways and Means Committee on schedule this week , it will face heavy opposition on the House floor . And in the Senate there will be the Finance Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man with plenty of power and a longstanding aversion to pies in the sky .
