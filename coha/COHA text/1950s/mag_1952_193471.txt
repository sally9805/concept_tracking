In the Washington Daily News : <P> <P> ' TEST TUBE ' RACE WOULD FIND LIFE MONOTONOUS <P> <P> Front Page Revisited <P> In fiction and in movies , if not always in fact , a good reporter can outsmart a dozen cops . Last week Hearst 's San Francisco Call-Bulletin ( circ. 160,271 ) made fiction into fact . To the Call 's city desk came word that a 17-year-old girl had been found beaten to death in a clump of bushes in San Francisco 's Mission Park . The staff hopped on the story and Reporter Bill Walsh soon turned up the names of the girl 's boy friends . <P> He relayed them to Rewrite Man Bob Hall , a veteran of 14 years on the paper , who had led police to a murderer once before . Hall went to work on the phone , ran down 18-year-old Roman Rodriguez , a pants presser . Did Rodriguez know the girl ? Yes , he did ; in fact , he had seen her the night before . <P> " From then on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Letting Rodriguez think he was a cop , Hall prompted him . Rodriguez almost casually admitted that he had had a few drinks with the girl , quarreled with her in the park and knocked her down . As he walked away , he said , " I looked back and saw a soldier helping her up . " Hall was convinced . Still talking on the phone , he scribbled a hasty note to City Editor Jack McDowell : " Whitcomb Hotel tailor shop ( Rodriguez - killer ) . " Reporters John Keyes , Walsh and two photographers raced to the Whitcomb , found Rodriguez at the phone , still talking to Rewrite Man Hall , and hustled him to the Call 's city room . <P> They plunked him in a leather-covered swivel chair , snapped pictures and hammered him with questions while they called the police . Even after the cops arrived , Rodriguez stuck to his story that he had not killed the girl . When the cops stepped out of the room to decide what to do , Reporter Keyes supplied the answer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Rodriguez . " No jury will ever believe what you 've told us . . . " " All right , " Rodriguez answered , " I 'll tell you the truth . I killed her . " When the cops came back , he made a full confession . <P> In 23 minutes the Call had the full story splashed across Page One under an eight-column streamer : MISSION HIGH <P> GIRL SLAIN , CALL-BULLETIN NABS YOUTH . <P> After the confession was complete , the Call graciously admitted a reporter and photographer from Hearst 's morning Examiner , but the rest of the San Francisco press had to wait . Said City Editor " Pete " Lee of the rival News ( circ. 125,625 ) : " We got thoroughly clobbered . " <P> <P> In Philadelphia , Bulletin ( circ. 697,718 ) Columnist Earl Selby , 34 , also played detective . A Republican politico , William F. Meade , was mysteriously shot recently in the lobby of a small Philadelphia hotel . To Democratic District Attorney Richardson Dilworth , the case was clear-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carroll , who was with Meade at the time , and with whom he had been " arguing and drinking . " Meade insisted the shot came from outside the hotel . But Dilworth offered as evidence a bullet-shattered pane of glass which , he said , FBI tests proved " conclusively " had been broken from the inside .
