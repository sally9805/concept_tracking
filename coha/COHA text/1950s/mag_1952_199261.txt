After all the backing &; filling on steel prices , steel is getting ready for another rise . This week OPS sent out drafts of an order that will allow steelmen to adjust their prices to higher costs , using the Capehart formula . Only steelmen know how much the boost will be . But Washington price controllers , who have been saying no to an increase for months , now guess that steel may jump anywhere from a dollar or two to as high as $8 a ton , thus giving inflation another nudge . <P> But in other industries last week the signs were of deflation . Because arms production has not yet taken up the slack created by cutbacks in civilian goods , total U.S. output was estimated to have dipped in January , a trend started in December . <P> While some civilian goods centers ( e.g. , Detroit and Providence ) have been hard hit by unemployment , defense centers ( e.g. , San Diego and Indianapolis ) were short of help . But the jobless showed few signs of abandoning seniority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to the new . <P> Many a once-tight raw material was becoming plentiful . This week NPA decided there was enough chrome stainless steel to drop priorities on it , also planned to end similar controls on five other products . <P> Department stores have already felt the overall slackening of business . Sales last week were 4% under the same period last year , when there was still some Korean war scare buying . The wholesale price index was 3% under a year ago , and just about at the low point for the last twelve months . The drop has already been reflected in retail price cuts in textiles , leather goods and furniture . By spring , other retail prices , which normally lag several months behind , may be down too .
