txt Democrats were elated and Republicans . were glum today over the special election in Wisconsin 's 9th congressional district yesterday . Democrats scored their first victory in the history of the district and hailed their triumph as a harbinger for capturing control of Congress in 1954 . Republicans attributed defeat to ' a shift of farmers from the G. O. P. to the Democratic party , but blamed a two year drop in prices inherited from the Democratic administration of Harry S. Truman . President Eisenhower had no comment on the election . Both Former Progressives Democrat Lester Johnson defeated Republican Arthur L. Padrutt for the seat held by the late Merlin F. Hull , Republican , who had represented the district since its creation in 1934 . Johnson , Padrutt , and Hull , who died last April at the age of 82 , all had at one time been members of the state 's Progressive party in the days of the elder Sen. Robert M. La Follette . Votes Call for Support Complete returns from the 401 precincts in the 11 county districts : ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' formal statement Democratic Chairman Stephen A. Mitchell described the election as " highly encouraging . " He said : " The victory of the first Democrat ever to be elected in the 9th congressional district of Wisconsin is highly encouraging . Press accounts indicate that the farm policy of the Eisenhower administration was a very important issue in the campaign . It would seem , therefore , that a farm program which falls far short of . last year 's campaign promises and ' contains no positive steps to offset falling farm prices is not going to be an asset to the Republicans in the 1954 congressional election . " The strong Democratic vote from the manufacturing areas of the district also seems to indicate that working people are not satisfied with the performance of the administration thus far . Wisconsin Democratic leaders inform us that Gov . Kohler campaigned vigorously in the district , asserting that the major issue of the campaign was support or repudiation of the President and his administration . This gives added significance to yesterday 's vote . The Wisconsin victory should give Democrats ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition is winning us new friends , but it should be no cause for complacency . " G. O. P. Chairman Leonard Hall acknowledged the result was anything but favorable and , called on party members to shake off complacency in the coming congressional campaign . Light Vote Turns Out " By any realistic appraisal the results in the Wisconsin special election are not good , " he said . " It is proof of what we have suspected . There are too many people who think that because we won the election in 1952 their work is ' done . When less than 33 per cent of the normal turnout of voters goes to the polls , as in Wisconsin yesterday , complacency is usually a substantial contributing factor . This defeat , I ' hope , will wake up a few people . " Of course , the anti-administration propagandists will attempt to interpret this special election as representing a national trend despite the very light vote and despite ample evidence there is overwhelming public support for the Eisenhower administration . " Will Lick Farm Problem " " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year price drop under President Truman on those who have the misfortune to inherit it . Our rural people are caught in a price and drouth squeeze which is neither their doing nor the doing of the Eisenhower administration . I think everybody understands this and sympathizes with our farmers . " Tne Eisenhower administration is going to lick the farm problem . The average farmer and the average citizen know that the colossal problems inherited by President Eisenhower are not going to be solved in a day or a month or a year . Nor are they going to be solved by electing Democrats to Congress to impede the progress that is being made . " Agriculture Secretary Benson sent word to reporters he had no comment on the voting . Many observers blamed his policies for the switch in the farm vote . There were undersurface murmurings that Benson has become a party liability and should be sacrificed . Sen. Wiley 1/ .. Wis. , who lives in the 9th district , said the results should " serve as a jolt to the Republican party , a jolt into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
