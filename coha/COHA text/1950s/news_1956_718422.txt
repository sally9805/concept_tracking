txt The fn ; innal Monetary Fund authorized Britain tonight to draw up to $1,300,000,000 to increase world confidence in the pound and forestall a British economic crisis . The action amounted to a dramatic move by Britain to marshal sufficient reserves to strengthen the pound sterling , currency for half the world 's commercial transactions , at its present level . The British Government already has emphasized that it does not intend to devalue the pound . Per Jacobsson , managing director of the International Monetary Fund , said the fund 's action had been taken " in the firm belief " that it would contribute to restoring the strong British balance-of-payments position that-had been emerging in the first half of 1956 . The action permits Britain to draw $561,470,000 immediately . This will go into British monetary reserves to meet payments requirements . Mr , Jacobsson said . Other Rights Granted Britain also is authorized to purchase with sterling during the next twelve months the equivalent of $738,530,000 in currencies of the Fund 's member notions .

The British merely are taking advantage of their right to draw on the quota of their money de ? posited with the fund , they said ; When the fund , designed to stabilize currencies , Was established in 1945 , Britain 's contribution to the pool was set at $1,300,000,000 . The fund had forty-four member nations at the time of its establishment . The new fund transaction has no effect on the United States budget or taxes . A spokesman for the fund said the $1,300.000,000 credit was " by far " the largest ever advanced to a member nation since the creation of the fund in 1945 . A credit of this magnitude is deemed more than sufficient to cover even the most pessimistic estimates of what the drain on sterling might be in the present crisis . The British deliberately chose to make a huge drawing as a method of demonstrating their resources to meet even the worst possible drain on sterling and thus to re-create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build after the Suez Canal crisis and apparently have been accelerated by the blocking of the canal and the British-French withdrawal from Egypt . In the first half of 1956 Britain had been moving satisfactorily toward a strong balance-of-payments position . Mr. Jacobson emphasized that the British Government had " made clear " its intention to keep the pound pegged at its present rate " and to avoid the reimposition of external controls . " " To this end , the United Ki -- dom Government has annoui.ced that it will follow fiscal , credit and other policies designed to strengthen the economy both internally and externally , " he added . Implicit in Mr. Jacobsson 's statement was the suggestion that present pressures on the pound probably were on1 ; , - temporary and that once they had been removed , Britain could continue her gradual progress toward convertibility . To most holders of sterling outside Britain the pound is readily convertible into dollars at a discount of slightly more than 1 per cent .

" For this reason , and in view of the special importance of sterling as a worldwide reserve and trading currency , the Fund has approved a transaction of this magnitude , " he continued . " It has done so in the firm belief that the action taken will permit the policies and measures of the United Kingdom to continue to operate and thus effectively contribute to the restoration of the strong balance-of-payments position which had been emerging in the first half of 1956 . " Mr. Jacobsson said Britain 's trading position ' has been and continues to be essentially sound . " Pressure on the economy had been " eased " in early 1956 , he said . " The credit squeeze was showing good results , the rise in prices had been checked and exports  --  including those to the dollar markets  --  had reached conord levels , " Mr. Jacobsson continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was after the emergence of the Suez crisis that pressure began to build on sterling , he said . The pressure was not caused " by weakness in the current account , but reflected a decline in confidence which caused remittances of sterling to be delayed and payments through sterling to be accelerated , " he went on . It was to reverse this trend " against a world-wide trading currency " that the Fund approved " on such a massive scale , " Mr. Jacobsson said . Britain got an advance of $300,000,000 from the Fund in 1947 and 1948 . This amount has been repaid in full , partly by purchases of sterling by other member nations and partly by British repurchase . For the present amount , which must be repaid within three to five years , Britain must pay from 2 to 31/2 per cent interest , depending on the time of repayment . As in the case of the 1947-1948 credits , her obligation to repay may be reduced proportionately to the amount of sterling that other member nations may purchase from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up as a result of conferences in the summer of 1944 at Bretton Woods , N.
