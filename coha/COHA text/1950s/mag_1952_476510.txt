I THINK I first began to be aware of my son 's dawning maturity , if I may dignify with a Victorian-sounding phrase a process which is so essentially messy , when he caught me in the act of reading the Kinsey Report . I had bought the Kinsey Report on the transparent grounds that no writer should be without a copy on his reference shelf , and I ca n't imagine why Goggle ( the childhood nickname we use among ourselves ) asked me what I was reading in the first place , since he has never been what you might call a literary type . I stammered somewhat in reply . " I am reading a book , " I said , blushing with lofty dignity , and polishing my spectacles in a scientific way , " which says here that young people know more about sex than we think they do . " " That , " Goggle said , with the terrible patience he sometimes employs with me , " is what I keep trying to tell you . " Actually Goggle has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up zwieback , and I think it not at all unlikely that a few hours spent with him would be . considerably profitable for Dr. Kinsey ; Dr. Kinsey , on the other hand , has been of very little help to me with Goggle , although , in all fairness , I did not expect him to be . About the best I can do is recognize the symptoms of an approaching seizure , although even that is not easy , since these symptoms , like those of the common cold , can be confused with so many other conditions , including , of course , the common cold . But let us take an example ; the evening , for instance , when I first knew that he was in love with Alice . It was early , before dinner , and I was relaxing in a chair with a cocktail . Goggle is convinced that I am an alcoholic . On the other hand , he also considers taking an aspirin an indication of drug addiction . But I was slumped there , the ruin of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . when Goggle came in from play . He was then a magnificent thirteen , and as he came into the living-room pictures trembled on the walls , ashtrays broke on the coffee table , and the upholstered chairs sagged in the middle . " How are you , Goggle ? " I asked , trying to start things off on a cheerful level . He looked at me blankly . " Huh ? " he said . " Never mind , " I said . " What happened in school today ? " He did n't hear me . He had begun to circle the room in a vague , tormented way , stumbling over chairs , picking at loose ends of wallpaper , and whistling through his teeth in that way which I had asked him ten thousand times , as of the previous March , not to do , please , for God 's sake . " Goggle , " I said . " Listen . " " Huh ? " " As long as you are on your feet would you hand me the evening paper from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankly . " The evening paper , " I said patiently . " On the table . " " What about it ? " " Would you please hand it to me ? " " Well , why did n't you say so in the first place ! " he demanded . " All this beating around the bush . " " Dinner wo n't be for half an hour or so , " I said . " Why do n't you go outside and break a few windows , or something . " " Hal " he said . " When I 'm out you call me in . When I 'm in you throw me out . A matt ca n't do anything in his own house . " ' " I know , " I said . " Things are tough all over . " He did n't reply . When he slammed the front door again on his way out the doorknob fell off on the hall floor . He had been making it burglar proof in some jazzy new way he read about in Popular Mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming in from the kitchen and taking a drink from her cocktail , standing , a mixing spoon in the other hand . " I hear her on the telephone , " she said . " I can hear her asinine giggle two rooms away . " " Oh , " I said , " that explains it . She seems like a very nice little girl . " " Nice little girls do n't ride on the handlebars of bicycles , " my wife said , in a dark and final tone . " Especially wearing blue jeans . " " Is there any chance they may run away and get married , or anything ? " I asked hopefully . " I do n't know about the running away , " my wife said . " It 's the anything I 'm worried about . " " Dear , " I said , in the fearful tone of a man who has been reading the Kinsey Report . " At thirteen ? " My wife put her cocktail down . She gave me a long , thoughtful look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am getting ahead of my story . Let us go back to the beginning . Or at least back to little Mary , the siren of the fifth grade . W E LIVED in the city then , the city of dreadful night , where mothers of little girls prowl with a restless eye , organizing dancing classes and making lists of little boys from which the little boys can never hope to escape until they arc transferred to the inactive or married file . In this steamy milieu of dotted swiss , seed pearls , and white gloves , Mary was like a breath of fresh air . She had pigtails and a sweet right uppercut , and every boy in the class was her slave . There was hardly a one of them that she could n't almost lick in a fight , if it was fair and square , and when she knocked them down and jumped on theirstomachs their yells of delight could be heard as far as the East River . Mary was the bottleneck as far as the dancing class was concerned , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father of a son there are moments like pearls ) , but at last she was thrown and hobbled and . enrolled in the dancing class , and all the little boys followed . I remember the first session well . It was only after he had dressed that it was discovered that Goggle had not bathed . He finally washed , under pressure , fully clothed , like painting around masking tape , and while the edges were damp , the exposed surfaces were clean , but no one , as he reasonably explained , was going to sec any more of him than that . We were waiting for him when he got home . It was a very warm afternoon and he rushed into the apartment , peeling his clothes off as he ran . Nude , with steam coming from his ears , he sank into an upholstered chair and gasped , " Mary chose me . " They had lined the girls up on one side , it seemed , and the boys on the other . When " the lady at the piano " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost trampled in the rush , so the forces had to be redeployed and lined up again . This time the girls would choose partners . And Mary , oh joy , had chosen our Goggle . We were all speechless with pride and excitement , but since it seemed a climax of some sort we hardly knew what to expect next . What happened next should n't have happened to a dog , because it was braces on Mary 's teeth , and overnight she became a hopeless bag . No boy would be caught dead tripping her in the aisle , or punching her in the back , or making any other such overt gesture of passion . Goggle buried himself in basketball . He was left guard that year and the apartment Was littered with scraps of paper on which brilliant plays were diagramed . I threw one in the fire once by mistake ; a loss to the world comparable with the hurning of the library at Alexandria . OON after we moved to the country , and Goggle met Jeanie . It is n't easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a pretty girl who , having had infan-tile paralysis , went to school on two crutches . Yet every day when she came home from school her real life began . From the sofa THE LOVES in her living-room she entertained , and not with the mawkish sentiment of an Elizabeth Barrett , but with the lively wit of a Madame Recamier . She had a record player , and games of all sorts , but most of all she knew how to talk . and how to laugh , even at herself . Everyone went there in the afternoon . Naturally , romance was rather difficult tinder such conditions , and it was at this point that we began to see the telephone as an aid to this tender sentiment . Goggle would come home reluctantly to dinner , and the slave labor of homework , that dread word which chills the hearts of all parents , but before he went to bed he would telephone Jeanie , sitting in the upstairs study from where he could see her lighted window as he talked . Goggle at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exacted from us for the privilege of gracing our house with his presence . Theoretically there was some work involved , like emptying the cat box , but the suffering this particular chore brought to his fastidious soul was so great that quite often we excused him , arguing that it was easier to do it ourselves . At any rate , from this tax levied on us he saved five cents a week toward a Christmas present for Jeanie . I went with him to buy it , to the great , glittering jewelry counters at Woolworths , and there he selected a bracelet of gold , with a pendant heart , wherein to keep his picture . Christmas was unusually slow in coming that year , and the bracelet was almost worn out from being looked at . Early Christmas morning Goggle got up and dressed and went over to Jeanie 's house , before his breakfast , before opening any of his own presents . We sat waiting for him , having coffee , and in a very short time he came back , came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face white with shock . It was some moments before he could even tell us what had happened . But apparently Jeanie had seen him as he ran up the front steps of her house . She was downstairs , unwrapping presents on her sofa , and she called his name , and stood , and took one step toward the door . Then she fell ? and broke her leg . Some sorrows are so hopeless they are beyond words or tears . Jeanie was taken to the hospital , and after they set the leg she was to be taken far away , for a long period of time , to another institution where the special care OF GOGGLE 87 she required could be given . Goggle went to see her before she left , and later , when our minister called on us for some reason or other , and thanked Goggle for having gone to see Jeanie , in that unfortunate way some . ministers have of imagining that the power is given to them , as dedicated men , to express the inexpressible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back . " That was n't very polite , " I said afterward , and Goggle turned on me , fiercely . " Why should he thank me ? " he asked , his face hot with unshed tears . A FTER that Goggle took apart everything in sight , including the electric mixer , his bicycle , and the odd carburetors and clocks and other objects of virtue which always seemed to find their way to his room . Our repair bills were rather high at this time . ( Any article which could not be put back together again was , of course , incorrectly put together in the first place by dopes who did n't know what the heck they were doing . ) We did n't complain , but our hearts ached , and we longed for some diversion for poor Goggle , so that when Alice appeared on the scene we welcomed her with some relief , even if she was a menace . Alice wore her hair down to her shoulders , and , really , it was such an awful nuisance , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , like this , with her hand . She giggled all of the time she was n't sleeping , and she fluttered her eyelashes a good bit . She imparted to Goggle her profound and original discovery that she really did n't like other girls very much . Boys were much more interesting . It was a mutual regard . The boys found her very interesting , and the girls could n't stand her at all . I asked one of her contemporaries one day why she did n't like Alice . ( Parents are awful during this period . They lose all ethical sense and stoop to anything to get information ) . The girl told me that Alice was " corny . " " What do you mean , corny ? " I asked . " Oh , you know , " she said . She puts paint on her toenails . " I was properly grateful for this definition , as I told her at the time , but I knew from that moment , with the same sinking feeling Samson 's father must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gone goose : Alice called on the telephone to make secret trysts , hanging up without answering if one of us got to it first . She gave Goggle a picture of herself which he carried in his wallet , along with his Confederate dollar , his membership card in the junior Magicians of America , and a theater pass which had expired the year before . When they walked together she held his hand , and if he said anything even remotely funny she threw her head back with laughter and crinkled her eyes . I remembered my own . youthful affair with Barbara LaMarr , when I had slept with her picture under my pillow , but at least Miss LaMarr had not been there in the flesh to hold my hand and inflame my senses , and Goggle was reduced to a state of absolute idiocy . He became a sort of pint-size Neanderthal man whose . only communication with us was " ugh , " and he ate his way moodily through about five hundred dollars ' worth of assorted groceries , munching with the absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where it all would have ended ( certainly , as I have pointed out , the good Dr. Kinsey was no help ) if Goggle had n't discovered one day that Alice had also given her picture , a copy of the same one , to Butch Butcher , who was not only bigger than Goggle but who , it was rumored , could stand on his head for five minutes by the clock and drink a glass of water at the same time . And that ended that . " Her poor mother , " Goggle 's mother said piously , as she burned the contents of his wastebasket , including the torn scraps of Alice 's picture . T HE next year we went abroad , and in the English school where Goggle was put he found himself involved in an international intrigue with State Department undertones . The first inkling we had about it was his asking one day if he could bring " Sally " home for lunch . " Sally ? " his mother asked . " Sure , " Goggle said impatiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , " Mother said . " Sally , of course . Tell me , does Sally have a mother I can tele-phone ? " " Why do you have to telephone her ? " Goggle asked with alarm . To ask her if Sally can come for lunch . " " How dumb , " Goggle said . " What 's her mother got to do with it ? " ( I should like to point Out here that the wise father will not allow himself to say , " Hal " or , " You 'll learn , " or any such similar remark , since it will only bring down upon his head the wrath of both parties . ) At any rate , Sally 's mother was duly called , and Sally duly appeared , one day , for lunch . It was the only time I have ever put my foot down . " I did n't know the situation would ever arise , " I whispered sternly to my wife in the kitchen , " but even at this late date I shall have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house more than once . " Sally had brought her baton with her to lunch , a gleaming chromium affair with a tassel on the end , and as we sat and chatted she practiced her twirling . She was a pretty , shy , blonde girl , but my heart hardened against her and did not thaw until later , at luncheon , when she brought off a brilliant coup . We had been having trouble getting Goggle to eat any fruit or vegetables that season , and when dessert came to the table , fresh fruit , Goggle explained that he had eaten so much he had no more room left . " Sally , " I said , on a sudden impulse , " see that Goggle eats his fruit . " With a cry of alarm , Goggle leaped from the table and ran out on the terrace and climbed a mimosa tree . Sally , however , was quick on his heels , and with a stiperb dexterity , learned , apparently , from baton twirling , she snaked up the tree , dragged Goggle down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . I was tremendously impressed by this performance . Awe overcame my prejudice . I told myself that batons were probably something one got over , like beadwork or acne , and all went smoothly for a While . Things came to a bead , however , very quickly after that . On a Friday afternoon Goggle came , home to tell us that Sally had invited him to go to a . picnic with her family on Sunday . He told us in a rather offhand way , not looking at us , and added that Sally had said he did n't have to come if he did n't want to . " Why would n't you want to ? " my wife asked . " Well , " Goggle said doubtfully . " They only speak German . It 's a club , like , and they hike . " The three of us regarded each other silently . " Goggle , " I said . " Just what does Sally 's father do ? " He looked at me directly . " He was a German soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of ours in the Embassy . Yes , Sally 's father had been one of the leaders and organizers of the Nazi Blind . Sally 's mother was an American , and Sally had not been in school for some time after the war . Her father still had a club of some kind , ostensibly nonpolitical , and there was nothing to be done about it . I saw him once after that when I drove Goggle to Sally 's house . He was on the terrace playing chess with a friend , presumably one of the members of his club . They were large Germans in leather Tyrolean pants , and they greeted Goggle warmly and heavily in German . I did not go in , and Goggle never went back . " It would be nice to think that the sins of the fathers did not have to be visited on the children , " Goggle 's mother said . Goggle murmured something evasive in reply . I understood better now the look of shy defiance which Sally had worn in our house , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her that it was all right with me if she wanted to be a drum majorette . What the heck , none of us were perfect . But she never appeared again . W HEN we came home again Goggle got mixed up with a real witch , one of the most beautiful I have ever seen . Goggle 's mother liked her , a fact which I tried to put down to lack of perception , but it scared me a good bit because I knew how helpless Goggle and I were in the face of feminine conspiracy . Little Helen of the chestnut hair , and the tawny skin , and the warm , slow voice could sit on the edge of a swimming pool in her red bathing suit , and in less than five minutes spin the prettiest web in which ever a man found himself hopelessly entangled . I consoled myself by thinking that it was just a summer romance , to be forgotten when the first hint of sharpness in the air brought the footballs out to be passed around . Butwhen summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Goggle , and I do n't know if my character has ever been more severely under trial than when it fell to me to bring these letters home from the post office . They were in pale blue envelopes , addressed in a round , girlish hand beginning to be a woman 's hand , and they had a mysteriously exciting scent , like strawberry jam . But when Goggle went off to school and the letters stopped coming to us , I guess I put Helen out of my mind . It was a great relief , in fact , to think of Goggle safely stashed away in the hills , far from the siren 's call , where football gave way to basketball , and basketball gave way to baseball , and where , everything else being equal , the teachers might get a few fast algebraic equations into his head while his glands were in abeyance . When we went up the following spring to bring him home , it fell to me to help him pack his things . His room , if I may call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Augean stables . I stood in the middle , with his foot locker open on one side of me and a wastebasket on the other , while Goggle directed the disposition of each object as I held it aloft from the shambles . Pack that , he would say , or " toss " that . It was with agreeable surprise that I discovered , after I had worked down through several layers of cultures , that all the letters I had written to him were neatly stacked together on one of the bookshelves . Saved for publication , I decided . Probably posthumous . I could see the volume , The Goggle Papers , taking its place in the libraries of the world alongside The Letters of Lord Chesterfield to His Son . " What about these ? " I asked cautiously , holding up the precious packet . Goggle looked carelessly over his shoulder . " Oh , toss em , " he said . " No use saving those . " I tossed them , with a sigh , and a rebuke for my vanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moment before Goggle snatched it from my hand , I opened and discovered to be full of those pale blue envelopes smelling of strawberry jam . " Might as well start down to the car ' with a few things now , " he said gruffly , tucking the cigar box under one arm , and grabbing up a load of hooks in the other . He went downstairs and I sat on the edge of the bed , fighting the worst case of resentment I have ever felt in my life for another human being . It was n't directed at Helen herself , but for the first time it really dawned on me that someday one of these girls was actually going to get Goggle and take him away for her own , for better or for worse . And there just was n't anything I could do about it , no matter what she was like . How did I know she 'd be good enough for him ? Would she be one of those revolting little girls , grown up , who had chanted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog 's tails ? Would she be one of those terrible , ruthless women who would make Goggle pay for being a man , and pay ; andpay ? But even if not , would she ever be able to see beyond the bluster and the transparent toughness to the vulnerable man inside ? The real Goggle , with his capacity for tenderness , his capacity for love and idealism , his capacity for being hurt ? Would she , for example . this unknown girl waiting for him somewhere even now , ever be able to sec in him the boy lie had once been , with a smudged face and a wart on his elbow and a cigar box under his arm , full of a girl 's letters ? ? " Come on , " Goggle said , coming hack into the room . " Let 's get this crud packed up . I 'm hungry . " " Okay , " I said . I stood up and bent over the foot locker , and silently we stuffed it full .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
