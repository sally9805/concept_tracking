One of the best ways to stir up a Congressman is to reject or to cut the appropriations he wants . In this session of Congress no one has refused and cut more than crusty old ( 76 ) Clarence Cannon , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee . Last week the House cut back at Missourian Cannon . <P> The Open Rule . The ringleader was Michigan 's Democratic Representative Louis Rabaut , a man with a special grudge . As the head of an appropriations subcommittee on public works for the Eastern U.S. , Rabaut had seen his recommendations junked by Cannon , who autocratically rewrote the bill . <P> But Rabaut had plenty of eager help . Cannon had particularly annoyed many another Congressman by refusing to move quickly in providing pay-raise funds for committee staff members and other House employees . This annoyance turned to fury last week when Cannon wrote into the catchall supplemental appropriations bill a sentence giving immediate pay raises to some of his own committee staffers-but to no others . <P> Before the supplemental appropriations bill could go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules Committee , which was still waiting for a pay raise for its own employees . Since nearly every appropriations bill goes against some House prohibition , e.g. , appropriations bills can not contain substantive legislation , it has long been the custom for the Rules Committee to set terms under which points of order are waived during floor action . But not this time : the Rules Committee coldly sent Clarence Cannon 's bill to the House under a wide-open rule , placing it at the mercy of every point of order that might be raised . <P> " I Concede . " On the House floor Louis Rabaut was waiting . Against nearly every clause of the supplemental appropriations bill Rabaut raised a point of order . But Clarence Cannon , who has a notoriously low boiling point ( he has been in fistfights with other Congressmen time and again ) , remained cool . " I concede the point of order , " he said repeatedly . His reason : Cannon figured that he could show up the Rules Committee 's petty vengeance by letting it result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cannon agreeing , out went money for agricultural conservation . Out went funds for the Farmers Home Administration , for the Small Business Administration , for military construction and public works . Out went an appropriation for new headquarters for the Central Intelligence Agency . <P> Item after item was killed , until only $222 million ( or about one-eighth ) was left in the bill that had originally appropriated $1,648,876,128 . The members of the House sat happily watching the slaughter ; general feeling was that it could hardly be happening to a more deserving guy than Cannon or a more deserving committee than Rules . Besides , the Representatives all knew that the Senate would restore the cuts . <P> Despite this indulgence in revenge , the Congress ' did manage to get some work done last week .
