At 14 of the nation 's major airports last week , big new radar installations of spinning antennas and scanning screens were being readied for use as part of a $13 million radar network that will eventually help control air traffic around 27 major U.S. cities . On Wall Street many a brokerage house tuned in with its own radar to take a reading on the firm responsible for the network : Raytheon Manufacturing Co. of Waltham , Mass . They liked what they saw so well that Raytheon stock moved to an alltime high of $30 a share . <P> Last week Raytheon won a $6,000,000 contract for the electronic controls of the Navy 's new surface-to-air Tartar missile , announced a $6,000,000 contract for development of a radically new sonar system for atomic submarines . To manufacture top-secret communications equipment for the Air Force , the firm is shopping around for a huge new factory that will add one-sixth more capacity to its plants , which are scattered from Massachusetts to California . <P> " Make Some Money . " Raytheon was founded in 1922 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onetime Tufts roommate , Laurence K. Marshall . It remained a midget until World War II , when its sales rocketed from $4,400,000 to $173 million . But the firm came so near to disaster in the postwar defense slump that its directors called in Yankee Banker Charles Francis Adams , of the famed Massachusetts Adamses , to put it back in shape . ( Marshall resigned in 1948 . ) Adams found a storehouse of talented scientists . But they loved research more for its own sake than for profit . Adams began searching for ways to put their talents to work making money , later cut out such money-losing items as TV sets , decided that Raytheon 's future lay in increasing Government work . He brought in Harold Geneen , former vice president of Jones &; Laughlin Steel Corp. , as executive vice president in 1956 , told him : " Make some money . " <P> Geneen rattled the structure of Raytheon so completely that the dust has just started to settle . He found " a $200 million operation with management enough to run only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Raytheon developed and marketed a product only to lose out when hit by competition . To solve such problems , Geneen brought 32 executives into new management spots , reorganized the company into seven divisions , set a controller over each to exercise searching financial control . <P> Keep It Fluid . While it was changjng its pace , Raytheon really went after military contracts , now does 80% of its business with the Government . It is the only U.S. electronics firm with prime contracts for two mass-production missiles ( the Army 's ground-to-air Hawk and the Navy 's air-to-air Sparrow III ) , is subcontractor for electronic devices for twelve other missiles and for equipment for the 6-52 and the 6-58 . It is also manufacturing transistors , and their successor spa-cistors , for everything from field radios to satellite innards , hopes to raise its $60 million-a-year civilian business to $150 million by 1965 with such items as weather radar , tiny radar sets for pleasure boats , diathermy equipment for hospitals .               @ @ @ @ @ @
