txt A powerful group within Britain 's Labor Government is seeking to scale down this country 's commitments under the rearmament nrozram . To what extent it may succeed can not be foreseen , but the prospect of a Britain deliberately dragging her feet in the attempt to build a collective Western defense force has United States observers worried . ' Last summer the British Government agreed to spend ? 3,400 , - 000,000 ( $9,520,000,000 ) in the next three years on its defense establishment . Since then extras have been added , bringing the figure close to #3,700,000,000 . All this , however , was conditional upon the United States putting up ? 550,006,000 , or about 15 per cent of the total , in dollars to be spent as the British chose .. Since then Hugh Gaitskell , the new Chancellor of the Exchequer , has been taking the line , which is supported by Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin that the whole defense program should be undertaken on a basis of partnership rather than ? on the basis of charity or aid . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the meetings of the North Atlantic Pact deputies . But since this at first seemed largely a matter of semantics , it was not regarded as vitally important . Since last summer the British have learned that any dollars that are allocated for defense will be " tied " to defense needs . This they do not like . Those members of the Cabinet who never have liked the Idea of outside assistance are wavering over the question of whether to go further into debt to the United States . ? If it comes to an issue they probably will say that to strain the domestic economy is to fall into some Russian trap . There is a point , they say , beyond which it is economically unsafe to go . What they mean is that if the domestic economy is overstrained there will come a time when the standard of living will fall to a point so low that the Communists could exploit it for their own purposes . Partn6rshlp Idea Pressed . However , the idea of partnership seems to have been seized upon by a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of such substantial diversion of the national in ? come to rearmament . It is thi : group 's idea that each member country of the Atlantic Pact should contribute to the common defense according to its means without outside help . If that view were ter Prevail thE whole progress of rearmament it the West and it might even wrecit result would be to slow down the the program , already hampered b3 French objections to Anglo-Ameri ? can-ideas about the part German ) shall play in Western defense . The objectors to the announced policy of the Government have thE support of an important pacifist n cr of tha T.ahnr party whn fee ' that American Impatience will bring about an armament race that would increase the danger of war . ' And they have the - support of those within the party who believe that , a -. - defense program on the scale that has been planned can only raise the cost ; of living higher and thereby destroy what hope remains of a ' Labor party victory in the next general election . The dissidents within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bevan , . Health Minister ; John Strachey , Secretary of State for War , and George R. Strauss , are among them , have seized upon what could , be a popular issue . Nobody wants war , nobody wants to spend money on armaments in preference to housing and nobody wants the cost of living to go on rising . Nor do the British like being the objects of charity . So there is a strong appeal in the idea that each country must stand on its own feet and do what It can with its own resources , but no more . The trouble is that at the present time no country in Europe can do enough on its own . In the view of United States ' observers it is one thing to contribute a full glue to the common defense but quite another to limit the total effort by saying " This is all we can do ourselves and we wo n't accept outside help . " Yet that is what the dissidents to the Government 's policy advocate . They are opposed to the acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that their defense program would have to be scaled down by at least ? 550 , - 000,000 over the next three , years . By standing on her own feet in the defense program , the leaders of the groups king a revision of British policyelieve that Britain 's prestige and independence would be enhanced . This country 's opportunities for moral leadership , they hold , are lessened in direct proportion to its dependence on American dollar help .
