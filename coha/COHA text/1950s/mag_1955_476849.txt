THE TRADE of advertising is now so near to perfection that it is not easy to propose any improvement , " Dr. Samuel Johnson declared in 1759 . " But as every art ought to he exercised in due subordination to the public good , I can not but propose it as a moral question , whether they do not sometimes play too wantonly with our passions . " Dr. Johnson 's passion never was one to be played with too wantonly , and perhaps it is just as well that he never lived to experience a television commercial . Nevertheless , the great thunderer of Gough Square still has his followers on Madison Avenue in 1955 . The trade of advertising teems with executives who find it difficult to propose any improvement in their product . American advertising ? which in a few decades has transformed itself from a minor craft operating on the fringes of a production economy into a central impelling force of a vast consumer economy ? flay have changed the American way of life , but it has n't done much to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirties Big Radio has come and gone , the ranch-type house has arrived in all itsglory , people have taken to spending more money annually on going to musical concerts than on going to baseball games . Yet , with all this , most advertisers seem content enough to continue in the world of their colleagues twenty years ago ? the world of scientifically-proven ingredients , amazing , miracle-toothpaste discoveries , and fast , satisfying , four-way relief . Once , during a foray into Radio City , en-countered a network vice-president who recog-nixed this , and who spoke to me earnestly about the necessity of educating advertisers to a more modern view of prevailing public taste , He then took me into a television studio to watch him supervise a rehearsal of a closed-circuit television performance for advertising-agency executives . The performance was supposed to demonstrate to ad men the advantages of using color commercials , and one of the first things the vice-president did was to correct the acting of a performer playing the part of an average viewer . Until he was called to task for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character who was n't very bright . The vice-president soon put a stop to all that . He had him play the average viewer as a simple moron . Persistent though this image of the average man may be in the minds of some of our most powerful advertisers , it would he unfair to say that there arc no signs of change along Madison Avenue . In an age when a bright young Yale man pounding out , say , soap-opera commercials for a big New York advertising agency can find himself , overnight , in the White House pounding out homilies for use in screenside chats , anything can happen . Lately , the entrenched power of the old four-way-relief school of advertising along Madison Avenue has even been subject to some degree of challenge by younger men with tolerably fresh ideas and occasionally a comparatively literate approach to the American public . Perhaps the best-known of this group of Young Turks in the advertising world is David Ogilvy , the president of Ogilvy , Benson and Mather , a New York agency that was formed six years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison Avenue standards , fairly small ? it employs only 126 people ? Ogilvy , Benson and Mather is exerting an influence on American advertising out of all proportion to its size , and Ogilvy himself is regarded by many ad men as one of the most successful copywriting executives to come along in the postwar era . Madison Avenue has given the world the model charcoal-gray suit ; Ogilvy , Benson and Mather has given Madison Avenue the model with the charcoal-black eye-pa tch . Since his agency was formed in 1949 , Ogilvy has been responsible for the production of such handsomely illustrated ads as those in the " Come to Britain " series placed in magazines on behalf of the British Travel Association , and for the campaigns on behalf of Guinness Stout and Viyella fabrics . Above all , he has been responsible for promoting what are probably the two most luminous characters to appear in American advertising in years ? the Man From Schweppes and the Man in the Hathaway Shirt . SINCE they began to appear in the ads a while back , these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Schweppesman Extraordinary , with his briefcase and homburg , fairly breathing international good fellowship , as well as quinine water , from behind his red beard ; the Man in the Hathaway Shirt , ever haughty and aloof behind his eye-patch ? have became nationally famous figures . They are men of distinction 's men of distinction . The Commander , who really is a former Commander in the British Navy , as well as being the real president of Schweppes ' American subsidiary company , and the Man in the Hathaway Shirt , who does n't wear an eye-patch outside of a photographic studio , are discussed at cocktail parties , in the press , and on the air , and the rate at which they sell Schweppes and Hathaway shirts is one that promises to make the manufacturers of both commodities rich beyond the dreams of avarice . Like the ads in which the Man from Schweppes and the Man in the Hathaway Shirt appear , most ads put out by Ogilvy , Benson and Mather are marked , not only by their striking central ideas and illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy . The peculiar combination of all three factors that comprises the Ogilvy Touch is typically apparent in ads the agency once did in a regrettably short-lived campaign for Guinness Stout ? a series of layouts simply entitled " Guinness Guide to Oysters , " " Guinness Guide to Cheese , " and " Guinness Guide to Guinness , " and accompanied by color photographs of a mouth-watering array of different kinds of oysters , cheeses , and foam-brimmed antique beer glasses and mugs . " Oyster Bays are mild and heavy-shelled , " remarks the caption underneath a photograph of one splendid-looking specimen of that variety of oyster . " It is said that oysters yawn at night . Monkeys know this and arm themselves with small stones . They watch for an oyster to yawn and then pop the stone in between the shells . Thus the oyster is exposed to the greed of the monkeys . " Again , under a picture of a rosy-shelled Edam cheese : " Edam is auditioned before it is sold ? the Dutch cheesemongers tap each cheese and judge its quality by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannonballs . The delicate flavor calls for Half-andHalf ? half beer , half Guinness . " In the " Guinness Guide to Guinness , " Ogilvy 's copy may remark under a photograph of a fine Toby jug , that " mulled Guinness is made by plunging a red-hot poker into a jug of Guinness Stout ... the immersion of the poker is an exciting business . Mulled Guinness should be drunk in winter , before a biasing log fire , with the curtains drawn . " Or elsewhere it may simply quote from the diary of a cavalry officer wounded at Waterloo : " When I was sufficiently recovered to be permitted to take some nourishment , I felt the most extraordinary desire for a glass of Guinness . I shall never forget how much I enjoyed it . I thought I had never tasted anything so delightful . " THE MAN BEHIND THE ADS IN APPEARANCE and manner , Ogilvy , I the creator of this sort of advertising , is about as distinct from the outsider 's image of the advertising executive as his Guinness copy is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British wartime intelligence service in this country and a former second secretary of the British Embassy in Washington . At forty-three , he is a rather scholarly-looking man of medium build , with curly hair , horned-rimmed glasses , pronounced British speech , and a manner of Oxonian briskness . In his conversation the usual argot of Madison Avenue is generally absent ? he once sent a memo to his subordinates deploring the use of the word " advertisingwise " ? and when , in the course of his work , he bends down to glance over his glasses at a layout for a new Rinso ad which has just been brought in to him , he can do so with the air of a British Foreign Office official examining the latest diplomatic dispatch in from Tehran . Nonetheless , when he gets up before an advertiser 's convention to make a speech ? which is fairly often ? the ideas he expresses can he every bit as much in the spirit of Madison Avenue as in that of Whitehall . Ogilvy does n't let himself fall into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rousing address to fellow ad men on the subject of the quasi-professional status they have to content themselves with in life , he boldly proposed , as a means of improving their social standing and of enabling them to live more graciously , the founding of a college of advertising and marketing ? Universitas Advertensis . " Very few of our clients respect our professional judgment as much as they respect the judgment of their lawyers or their doctors , " Ogilvy told his colleagues , after warming them up with the reminder that Charles Lamb and Lord Byron once worked as copywriters . " The fastest way to make advertising a profession is to establish a reputable system of education . . . . I am thinking of something first-class , on a par with the Harvard Law School and MIT .. , . This college would send out into the world an elite corps of practitioners to staff not only our agencies , but also the advertising and marketing departments of our great manufacturing firms .. . . We all admire our friends in the medical profession for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure that we , in our turn , would be happy to give up at least one morning a week to teaching students at the advertising college . " J LT ST WHAT would comprise the curricu-. /um of Universitas Advertensis Ogilvy did not divulge in any detail , but the vision of advertising executives giving three-year anatomical courses on the T-Zone , or rigorous medical training in the diagnosis and cure of such advertising diseases as Clothespin Nose , Buzz-saw Throat , Ankle Slouch , or Traffic Foot is a compelling one . Ogilvy 's proposal was splendidly received by the excited ad men . At other professional gatherings , however , Ogilvy has found himself confronted with a notably unenthusiastic reception by making speeches in which he reproved some of his colleagues as " weasel merchants " and purveyors of poor taste . Many advertising executives , who do not take kindly to this sort of thing , consider Ogilvy something of an adventurer . They also pooh-pooh many of his advertising notions , and the strength of , his agency . Madison Avenueis strewn with the remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hold on to accounts , and Ogilvy 's detractors , while admitting that his agency has attracted a great many accounts , point out that it has also resigned quite a few , too , in its brief history . " David may he doing all right now with luxury item accounts , and that sort of stuff , but where is he with the competitive items in the packaged goods field ? He ca n't last forever on a couple of good ideas , " one agency executive remarked testily when questioned about Ogilvy 's progress . Ogilvy , however , is left unperturbed by such mutterings . He regards them as the manufacturers of Hathaway shirts look upon public discussions about the Man in the Eye-patch ? as healthy publicity . " I 'm a very crass fellow , having once been a door-to-door salesman , " he remarked politely in a recent interview as he sat sipping a cup of four o'clock tea in his modern , elegant office just off Fifth Avenue . " I do n't think there is any other business in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , " he went on , " I do happen to think that advertising need n't be dull , vulgar , or in poor taste . Most of us in this business have been guilty of stimulating the psychological insecurities of our fellow creatures in one way or another . We have set impossible standards , 01 example , of feminine beauty , and left the great mass of normal-looking women to conclude that they are inferior beings . I myself in the past have talked to teen-age girls about the ' tragic embarrassment ' of their blemishes ; I find it hard to forgive myself for that . " Ogilvy paused thoughtfully , possibly trying to forgive himself . Then , more cheerfully , he went on : " 1 do think , though , that what 's principally wrong with advertising is not so much poor taste as just plain dullness . Most ads are fearfully dull , and they 're written for obscurity . The average reader notices four ads in the average magazine ? not much , is it ? Unfortunately , most advertisers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than advertising copy would indicate . Look at the difference between the level of the editorial copy in Life , which can often be quite high , and the ads in the same magazine , and you 'll see what 1 mean . Here we try to approach the public on a 1955 level . " David Ogilvy was born in Surrey , England , the younger son of a Scottish father and an Irish mother . During his early childhood his father , who had been a well-to-do stockbroker , suffered business reverses that left the family poor , but Ogilvy made his way through an excellent private school in Edinburgh , and later through Oxford , by means of scholarships . After graduating from Oxford in the depths of the Depression , and finding no jobs available in England , he took off for Paris to apprentice to a chef at the Hotel Majestic and for a year at a salary of 150 francs a month he worked a sixty-five-hour week as a kitchen hand . " The tempo was terrific . We were careerists in a hurry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of France eating a souffl ? I cooked . He died a week later . " AFTER a year of cooking , Ogilvy was offered a job selling kitchen stoves in England by a British concern . As one of his qualifications for the job was an ability to talk kitchen French , he was quickly assigned , by way of a starter , to calming clown the chefs of a Picadilly club who were disgustedly planning to throw out one of the company 's stoves they had just bought . Ogilvy cooked with the chefs for a month and persuaded them to keep the instrument . He was then appointed the company 's Edinburgh representative and given as bleak an assignment as a salesman could dream of ? cold calling from door to door in Scotland at the bottom of the Depression . Ogilvy survived the test splendidly . He become the company 's most successful single salesman , went on to write its sales manuals , and in no time wound up in the advertising business in London , with the firm of Mather and Crowther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied and read and took it desperately seriously . I worked until three in the morning nearly every day , " Ogilvy says . He soon became an account executive , and in 1937 , feeling an uncontrollable urge to visit this country , he persuaded Mather and Crowther to send him here for a year to study American advertising techniques . His visit here , as he recalls it , was a professionally revealing one . " In England I had belonged to the highbrow school of advertising . We had been used to being impressed by advertising as a clever , if junior , form of entertainment , " Ogilvy says . " After seeing American advertising , I was immediatelyconverted from the highbrow and , although I suppose that to some extent I 've been converted back since , I became a fanatic utilitarian . " I saw advertising as nothing more than a selling tool and I thought American advertising magnificent . I was dazzled by its technical virtuosity . When I looked at Young and Rubicam ads , or heard them on the radio , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely swept away by it all ! When I returned to England , preaching this utilitarian gospel , the reactions of the highbrow copywriters there , the frustrated poets and disappointed artists , was one of alarm and contempt . Fortunately , I must say , the attitude of my employees in England was one of gratitude and understanding . " But what a time I had in America ! I was intoxicated by it . I was staggered by the beauty of its women . I thought it was the most wonderful , delightful , marvelous country on earth . I met large numbers of people , and all of them were terribly nice to me everywhere . I got to know La Guardia , and he was terribly nice to me . I met Thomas Lamont , and he was very kind to me . I got to know Alexander Woollcott rather well , and he was often very kind to me too . He was a peculiar man . Once at a big dinner party , he looked across the table and said to me loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . ' There was a profound silence at the table . Everybody else present was terribly kind to me for the rest of the evening . " THE BIRTH OF AN AGENCY A S THE result of his delighted impressions of the New World , Ogilvy , in 1939 , resigned from his London agency and came to America to settle . Here he married the former Melinda Street , of Richmond ? they now have a son , Fairfield ? and shortly he went to work for George Gallup , whom he had met on hiS previous visit . " 1 worked for Dr. Gallup 's Audience Research Institute at Princeton , " Ogilvy says . " We did a great deal of research on motion pictures and found out a lot that had n't been known in the industry . We found , for example , that the theory of sex appeal on which the star system was largely based was also largely fictitious . We discovered that generally men go to the movies to see actors and women go to see actresses . Nobody had looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-identification in movie-going . " Then , after Dr. Gallup , and the concept of sell-identification , came the war . Ogilvy went to work for British intelligence in this country as a liaison man with various U. S. security agencies . Not unexpectedly , he is uncommunicative about this phase of his career . However , his former boss is willing to go on record with a few words about Ogilvy 's wartime service . " David made not only a good intelligence officer , he made a brilliant one , " Sir William Stephenson , the wartime head of British Security Co-ordination here , said recently . Toward the end of the war , Ogilvy was transferred to the diplomatic corps in Washington to become second secretary at the British Embassy , and although , after V-J Day , he was offered the opportunity of continuing a diplomatic career , he decided to leave the service . He bought a farm in the middle of the Amish country in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , and for a while raised crops of cigar tobacco as he mulled over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , it seemed to Ogilvy , was his idea of founding an organization to promote the sale of British goods in this country , and after getting together with a New York advertising executive named Anderson Hewitt , and borrowing some money from a couple of London advertising agencies ? Mather and Crowther , Ltd. , his old employers , and S. H. Benson , Ltd. , ? he formed a new American advertising agency , Hewitt , Ogilvy , Benson and Mather . ( Hewitt is now with another agency . ) At first , most of the new agency 's business did come from British companies , as Ogilvy had planned , but as time went on it took on American accounts too . Nowadays , although Ogilvy , Benson and Mather still maintains a brisk business with British firms , by far the largest part of its business comes from clients over here ? Lever Brothers , Inc. , Helena Rubinstein , Hathaway Shirts , the government of Puerto Rico , Steuben Glass , Thom McAn Shoes , and so on . THE BARON IN THE HATHAWAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreign or domestic , none has more reason to be pleased with the association than the C. F. Hathaway Company , a firm of Maine shirtmakers that , in the 114 years of its existence before it engaged Ogilvy 's agency in 1951 , never had done any appreciable amount of advertising at all . The result of the association was , of course , thefellow with the eye-patch ? a creation that has been flatly described by Fairfax Cone , another advertising man , as a stroke of " almost pure genius . " The idea came to Ogilvy only at the last minute before he left his office in a taxicab one morning in the fall of 1951 to supervise the photographing , at a studio , of a male model wearing a Hathaway shirt . The model was a distinguished-looking fellow ? Baron George - Wrangel , the son of a Czarist naval attache ? and Ogilvy felt he needed an arresting device to emphasize the Baron 's tony appearance . Ogilvy drew up a list of seventeen ideas that seemed to him to have possibilities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the model wear a patch over his perfectly good right eye . " An eye-patch on a man had always struck me as having overtones of heroism and mystery . When such a man came into a restaurant , people would always tend to whisper , ' Who 's that ? ' " Ogilvy says . " I decided to try the idea out . On the way to the studio I picked up a fifty-cent eye-patch at a drugstore . We took lots of pictures , and then , just before we finished the session , I got the Baron to slip the eye-patch on and to be photographed with it . When we saw the color transparencies we knew right away that we had something rather good . " The appearance in the New Yorker of the first ad featuring the Baron , the eye-patch , and the Hathaway shirt caused an immediate flurry of publicity . A department store quickly ran an ad showing a girl in a girdle and an eye-patch . Time and other magazines ran editorial features about the ad , and before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs , cows , and babies . In one week Ogilvy counted five imitations of the ad in Danish newspapers alone . Men and women wearing eye-patches turned up in droves at fancy-dress balls , and anyone wearing an eye-patch for genuine , medical reasons became a walking advertisement for Hathaway Shirts . ( Articles analyzing the compelling nature of the Hathaway Shirt ads even appeared , in time , in learned magazines ? the consensus being that they probably contained elements of voyeurism . ) Within a week after the first ad appeared Hathaway sold out every shirt it had in stock and had to circularize haberdashers everywhere to beg for patience while it caught up with demand . The Baron , who before being photographed with the eye-patch had been working as a fur salesman , achieved happiness , too . He married a distillery heiress and now lives much of the time in a castle in Spain . But occasionally , when he returns here for a few weeks , he consents to pose for an extra ad or two ? now donning a pith helmet and posing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full symphony orchestra ? to keep Ogilvy happy . " 1 had a visit from the Baron just a little while ago , " Ogilvy said recently , in reminiscent mood . " He was very gracious . ' My dear old boy , ' he said ? George has an English accent , you know ? my dear old boy , I 'll tell you what Ell do . I 'll do three more ads for you . ' He named his price ? a staggering one . ' All right , ' 1 told him after some thought , ' I 'll have to pay it . It might console you to know , however , that this is the highest price ever paid for a model . ' ' My dear old boy , ' said George , ' it 's not the money , you know ? that does n't mean a thing to me . I 'm glad to help you out , David , old fellow . This thing is bigger than both of us . ' " THEY 'RE DOING ALL RIGHT B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably on the way . New accounts arrive at the agency , new ads come pouring out , and Ogilvy sees new advertising possibilities everywhere . Ogilvy works something like seventy-five hours a week , writing a good deal of his agency 's most important copy himself , and he takes a certain pride in his flexibility of approach . At one moment , writing an ad about Viyella socks for insertion in slick magazines , he will dash off words like " cognoscenti " and " connoisseurship " in his copy ; at the next , addressing himself to the proofs of a full-page newspaper ad for a shoe-company client , he will nod with satisfaction at the sight of the screaming headline , " AMAZING OFFER BY THO ? MCAN . " And a few minutes later , turning his attention to an ad featuring Commander Whitehead dallying in the bar of the Metropolitan Opera over a bottle of Schweppes Club Soda , Ogilvy will ensure that the accompanying copy is elegance itself : " Each little bubble bursts upon your tongue , heightening the flavor of your drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) will always serve you Schweppes Club Soda for highballs . " Occasionally , in writing copy for ads whose main feature is snob appeal , Ogilvy 's adjectives get so fancy that his own executives , and even Ogilvy himself , are n't sure of their exact mean-ing . Once , in a Hathaway shirt ad , his copy included the word " ineffable , " the use of which so confounded a reporter for Advertising Age that he called up Ogilvy to ask him if he could define the word for the readers of his publication . To his ineffable embarrassment , Ogilvy found himself at a complete loss for an answer . He now keeps a big copy of Webster 's on a stand close to his desk , within handy reach of his telephone . Perhaps , of all the ads that Ogilvy himself has written , none more blandly exploits diverse advertising appeals than one he did for Austin cars . The ad which Ogilvy modestly describes as " an attempt to combine snob appeal and economy " was in the form of a " Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I AM SENDING MY SON TO GROTON WITH MONEY I HAVE SAVED DRIVING AUSTINS . " By an amazing coincidence , the anonymous diplomat , who does indeed drive an Austin , turns out to be Ogilvy himself . His son , however , does n't go to Groton , and Ogilvy is not sure that he ever will . When the Austin ad came out , a magazine reporter got the headmaster of Grown on the phone and asked him what he thought of the idea of putting kids through his school by driving Austins . The headmaster 's reply to that one , as it was relayed to Ogilvy , has made the latter feel that he may as well drive his son through some other school for a while . HOWEVER , aside from such little contretemps , things so far , Ogilvy considers , have been going rather nicely . Hathaway shirts , since the appearance of the man in the eye-patch , has increased its sales from five million dollars a year to eight million through an advertising expenditure of about 585,000 a year ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a new cosmetics factory ; and Commander Edward Whitehead , the Schweppesman Extraordinary , is driving people to drink at such a profitable rate that the British government has officially expressed its gratification . " DOLLAR GAP CUT BY GIN AND TONIC , " reads a headline in the New York Times over a dispatch quoting Her Majesty 's Treasury report on the subject . " Yes , Schweppes is doing all right , " says Ogilvy , musing over his accomplishments to date . " Helena Rubinstein is doing all right . Rinso is doing all right , Hathaway is doing all right , and so is Viyella and so is Good Luck Margarine . They 're all doing all right . " And so , it seems , is Ogilvy.
