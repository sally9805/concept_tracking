Dear Time-Reader <P> During this political month , most of you will be following the two national party conventions . Perhaps you would like to know about the plans TIME has made to bring you the convention story-the story of what happens , and the much more important one of why and how it happens . <P> Plans for covering the 1952 conventions started nearly a year ago , when TIME wrote to the national committees of both parties to make arrangements for the newsmen who would attend the conventions ( see PRESS ) . Early this year , Don Bermingham , assistant to LIFE 'S managing editor , was put in charge of convention arrangements for all TIME Inc. publications , and inherited , among other things , the job of finding hotel space . The situation looked almost hopeless when he visited Chicago in February . But by last week , after numerous wires , letters and phone calls to hotel managers , Bermingham had finally rounded up enough rooms ( in six hotels not taken over by the convention committees ) for all of TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garry Osborne , TIME Inc. communications chief , in setting up a special network of telephone and teletype circuits capable of handling hundreds of thousands of words each day . Bermingham arranged for a special cab service for correspondents and photographers , and prepared a directory of strategic locations-hotels , map of the convention hall , etc . <P> Like the delegates themselves , TIME correspondents will go to Chicago from many sections of the country . A task force of half a dozen TIME reporters , in addition to Chicago bureau personnel , is on the scene already . Chicago 's Bill Glasgow is covering advance arrangements and Atlanta 's Bill Howland is watching the contests for delegates ' seats . <P> Other correspondents are watching developments within the key state delegations . Al Wright will go to the convention from San Francisco with the California delegation . Chicago Bureau Chief Ed Heinke has been following the Michigan delegation . In addition , about 20 of TIME 'S string ( part-time ) correspondents in the U.S. will be covering the conventions for their own newspapers and will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As convention time approaches , a sizable segment of TIME 'S normal New York City operations will also be transplanted to Chicago . TIME 'S top editors and a number of writers and researchers will be on hand to soak up the convention atmosphere , forming direct impressions of its mood , scene , movement and sound . <P> The work of TIME 'S correspondents-in the convention hall , at the delegates ' meetings , in the candidates ' headquarters-will be coordinated at a news desk in the Conrad Hilton Hotel . There Washington Bureau Chief James Shepley , who covers politics in and out of season , will share with Lawrence Laybourne , chief of TIME Inc. ' s U.S. and Canadian correspondents , the task of making assignments , and of tying together correspondents ' reports . By the time the candidate is nominated , TIME 'S editors will already have begun culling their own on-the-spot observations to bring you a report on the 1952 conventions . <P> Cordially yours , <P> James A.
