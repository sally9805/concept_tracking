Brigadier General Haydon Lemaire ( " Bull " ) Boatner was ready for his big test on Koje Island . He intended to break up the big compounds , and he decided to start with the 6,000 hard-core North Koreans in Compound 76-the gang that engineered the abduction of Brigadier General ( now Colonel ) Francis T. Dodd . To impress 76 's inmates , he staged a rehearsal with tanks and flamethrowers in an empty compound next to theirs . The prisoners answered by digging chest-deep trenches and continuing to turn out steel-tipped spears and other crude weapons on their hidden forge . <P> This week Boatner sent a message to 76 's tough leader , North Korean Colonel Lee Hak Koo : " This is a legal order for you to prepare the prisoners of war in Compound 76 to move out into the newly constructed compounds . . . " Lee ignored the order . When the paratroopers of the 187th Airborne Regiment moved in , the prisoners fought tooth &; nail . In the first hours of battle 32 Communists were killed and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 13 wounded . But eventually a heavy tear-gas barrage brought the Communists out of their trenches , choking and weeping , with their hands in the air . Even before the smoke and dust of battle had settled , it was clear that Bull Boatner had won .
