On September 21st one hundred tons of a fish poison will be dumped into Diamond Lake , Ore. , and it is expected that within 24 hours not a gill-breathing creature will have survived . The target of the operation , the undesirable fish which compete with the game species for food , will be eradicated along with their sporting brethren . When the lake is cleared , it will be restocked with game fish only , and another fisherman 's paradise will have been preserved . // Operation Eradication has already been well publicized in the West . The story that has n't been told is how the fish poisons work . They have been developed to the point where they can be applied with a finesse that is amazing . // LETHAL TO THE OUNCE // Probably the most modern is Fish-Tox , which contains rotenone  --  a fish poison which man has known for centuries . Rotenone is an ingredient of most lake eradicants . Its lethal qualities are so certain that dosages can be figured to the ounce . // Fish-Tox is a soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then quickly clears . It has a vertical rate of dispersion of one and a half feet an hour . In other words , a curtain of death descends in the water at the rate of 18 inches an hour . Nothing with gills can escape , nothing with lungs will be harmed . // Fish-Tox kills by constricting the capillaries which carry oxygen from the gills , causing suffocation . The fish thus killed are perfectly edible . The water is safe for people to drink . // When the poison begins to dissolve , minnows are the first to feel it . They shoot out of the water , dance crazily on the surface , even sail out on the beach . Other fish have varying degrees of resistance . Walleyed pike die easily ; so do bass , perch , bluegills , crappies and the carp which are so often the reason for the eradication . Bullheads and catfish last longer , but they only postpone the inevitable . As the invisible veil of poison sinks , it pins the fish against the oxygen-thin layer of lower water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish-Tox , it gets them . // Fish poisoning is not pretty , but the gain to sports fishing is tremendous . A trout lake in Washington , for example , which yielded only 1,000 fish a year because it was full of " trash " fish , was cleaned out completely and restocked . Two years later it was opened and yielded 5,460 half-pound rainbow trout the first day , and more than 56,000 rainbows during the first year . // In North Dakota , Storm Creek Reservoir , which formerly provided good fishing for bass and crappies , was taken over by carp . Eradicated by Fish-Tox and restocked with bass , pike and blue-gills , it now has excellent sport fishing . A surprise sideline benefit was noted by a farmer 's wife who rejoiced that the lake water was clear enough to wash clothes in , now that bottom-rooting carp had been eliminated . // The Bureau of Reclamation built Jamestown Dam , forming a 20-mile-long lake in the James River . Silt-laden , shallow and full of " rough " fish , it had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closed , North Dakota began the most ambitious eradication project yet attempted . Eighty-six miles of river , three lakes and countless sloughs that connected with the river were treated . Fish-Tox was spread from low-flying planes , towed behind motor-boats in burlap sacks , sprayed with hand pumps into marshy areas . Then came anxious days of test netting to check the effects of the application . The poison killed every gill breather in the entire river . Now restocked , the Jamestown Reservoir will provide sport fishing . // SURGERY OF THE FISHERIES // The biggest problem with most eradication programs is that of disposing of the windrows of dead fish on shore . If the fish are n't picked up and used for food , their presence soon becomes common knowledge . Waters treated with Fish-Tox remain toxic to fish for periods varying from 10 to 80 days , depending upon the water temperature . Warm waters dissipate the poison much faster than chill waters . // This is the new surgery of the fisheries world and , like medicine 's surgery , it is a drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate . Now fishery biologists are discovering new uses for the killer in limited forms of surgery . It is possible to cut down carp populations without harming game fishes by baiting the undesirable fish into shallow bays or inlets , sealing off the escape route with seines , and then applying Fish-Tox. // Overpopulations of desirable fish can also be thinned out . Two interconnected lakes swarming with rock bass yielded poor fishing because there just was n't enough food . So one lake was dosed , and the population of the other spread to the now-fishless waters . The rock bass grew larger . // Fish-Tox has even turned out to be a boon to ducks . The Fish and Wildlife Service used it in the big Arrow-wood Refuge in North Dakota to kill the carp so that duck foods would prosper . In most cases , however , it is the angler who benefits from this modern refinement of one of the oldest poisons known to man .
