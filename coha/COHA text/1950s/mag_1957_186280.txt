EMPIRE OF FEAR ( 351 pp. ) - Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov-Praege ( $5 ) . <P> True patriots all ; for be it understood <P> We left our country for our country 's good ... <P> - George Barrington ( Australian ex-convict poet ) , 1796 <P> It is improbable that Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov ever heard this cynical rhyme from the period when Australia was an English convict colony . But it might well have applied to the two Soviet citizens in 1954 when they left the service of the Russian secret police and were granted asylum in Australia . The story of the Petrovs-as they tell it themselves-is fascinating and informative on two counts . It gives a salutary refresher course in the feeding and breeding habits of the pestiferous swarm of Soviet agents at work outside Russia . And it gives a self-portrait of the " new " Soviet citizen to whom freedom is a myth and all the Christian charities of Western life are not even a memory . Moreover , unlike the stories of Kravchenko in the U.S. , Gouzenko in Canada or Krivitsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious touch of high comedy , together with its low politics . <P> Born for Tomorrow . The Petrovs were children of peasants . First war , then the Revolution , disrupted the life of the primitive villages in which they were born-his in Siberia , hers near Moscow . The two entered the sinister service of the MVD , after apprenticeship in the Red Youth Organization , as happily and naturally as ambitious U.S. youngsters would take a job with General Motors . Each had early experiences of hardship that evoke the lower depths of Gorky . ( Evdokia was hung by her heels in a barn and whipped by a grandfather because she had picked a cucumber ; Vladimir went hungry because the family horse he tried to sell to the White army was too poor . ) But they worked their dutiful way up as career Communists , and for these ex-peasants , the new life was rich . <P> Vladimir rated annual vacations with other tired terrorists , new warm clothes , passes to an excellent restaurant and to " any bathhouse . " Both had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite some drawbacks , e.g. , one of Vladimir 's vacations was spoiled a little by shop talk about executions . After Evdokia and Vladimir were married in 1940 , they were an enviable and well-adjusted husband-and-wife team in the world 's bloodiest police force . What went wrong with their lives ? Posted to the Soviet embassy in Canberra , the Petrovs never had it so good . With his pay as colonel in the MVD-plus her pay as captain-they made $18,550 , more than the salary of the Australian Prime Minister . But in contrast to the loose , shirt-sleeved , friendly Australian society , the Petrovs lived a life between nightmare and farce . <P> The Barnyard . The Soviet embassy was a true enclave-an island of cruel and clownish Soviet life . The best part of the Petrovs ' book describes in detail the life of the higher Soviet bureaucracy : by a paradox , the egalitarian theory of Communism has produced a pathologically heightened sense of status-so that life in the embassy went on by rules something like the pecking hierarchy observed by barnyard fowl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic picture within eyeshot of Stalin 's portrait , and even hotter water when she was falsely accused of having thrown a pie at the ambassador 's wife .
