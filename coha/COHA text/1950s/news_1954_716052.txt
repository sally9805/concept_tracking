txt Officials of the New York Coffee Exchange said they do n't see any chance of lower coffee prices in- the near future . On the contrary , they expect a serious shortage of coffee will show up in the crop year beginning next July 1 . " Assuming normal demand , I do n't see any prospect for lower prices . " vice president Leon Israel of the Exchange told a Senate Banking Subcommittee that is investigating the recent sharp ills : in ccffee prices . During his testimony , it was brought out that coffee now being sold for $1 or more a pound in retail stores was not affected at all by the frost in Brazil last July . Damage from this frost has generally peen blamed for the jump in coffee prices . Mr. Israel said the frost accelerated demand for coffee that has been shipped since July . But he stated that the full effect of the damage wo n't be felt until the crop year beginning next July 1 . " There is no shortage of coffee today , " Mr. Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues , we will find at the end of the crop year ( July 1 . 1955 ) no coffee left in Brazil . " Brazil is the largest producer of coffee in the world and supplies about onehalf of the total consumed in the United States annually . Look for Villain in the Case Members of the subcommittee , headed by Senator Beall ( Rep. , Md. ) tried repeatedly to find a villain in the coffee situation . Senator Bush ( Rep. , Conn ) brought out that Brazil es ? tablishes an official exchange rate for coffee that brings the country about twice as many dollars as it could theoretically get at the present free rate . " Is n't it'the case , " Mr. Bush asked . " that Brazil fixes a special coffee rate because they can get away with it ? He asked whether the artificial exchange rate did n't add a " aubstanlial increment " to the pi ice of coffee . But Mr larael and Gustavo Lobo . Jr , president of the Coffee Exchange . said it was n't easy to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price t ) the exchange rate Mr. LAM " noted that , since the dollar is so strong , the price of coffee in , Brazilian cuirency would probably rise sharply " if the official rate were discontinued . 4We might wind up paying the same price in dollars . though the price in cruzieros had gone up , " Mr. Lobo said . Much of the hearing was spent tracing coffee from farms in Brazil to retail shelves in the United States . Coffee now being sold for Si . the exchange experts testified , was purchased in'Brazil last summer at rates ranging from - 40 cents to 60 cents a pound . It was Santos . then to agents in New York , then to shipped to exporters at the Brazilian port of jobbers and finally to roasters , with each handler adding charges to it along the way . ' Profit Distribution Outlined A major increase in price occurred at the roasters , partly because coffee loses about 16% of its weight during roasting . To this is also added cost of grinding , packaging and distribution . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazilian exporter gets " around 1% , " the New York importer makes only about halt that , and the jobber " adds 1% for profit but is happy to get one-half of one percent . " For roasters ' profits , the Exchange head said , the committee would have to ask them .
