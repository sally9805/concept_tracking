Firing Up " Nancy dear , " said U.S. Steel 's Chairman Ben Fairless , " come on up here with Grandpappy and light your furnace . " Before a crowd of 200 Big Steel officials , families and friends , Fairless ' red-haired seven-year-old granddaughter touched an oil torch to a 6-ft. fuse , which began to sputter like a Fourth of July sparkler . Inside a giant blast furnace , the fuse ignited a stack of oil-soaked railroad ties , which in turn set fire to a charge of coke and started the furnace . A few minutes later , Nancy 's sister Carol , 5 , touched a button which fired a rocket through a plug in an open hearth furnace already going , and 250 tons of flaming , molten steel poured into a massive ladle . Thus last week , less than two years after groundbreaking ( TIME , March 12 , 1951 ) , U.S. Steel 's $450 million Fairless Works in Morrisville , Pa. , went into operation . <P> In the tradition of the steel industry , the Fairless Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Carol " for the granddaughters and " Hazel " for Ben Fairless ' wife . Explained Fairless : " A blast furnace is always known as a lady and is named for one-not be cause the furnace is a thing of shapely beauty , exactly , but because it is inclined , at best , to be somewhat temperamental . " <P> More than 4,000 contracting firms in 27 states had a hand in supplying materials and equipment for Big Steel 's new plant ; 10,000 construction workers labored on the 3,900-acre site . The Fairless Works , part of the steel industry 's more than $3 billion post-Korea expansion program , has 75 miles of railroad track , 20 miles of improved roads , 30 miles of sewers , and a water-treating plant which will handle 254 million gals . of water daily , enough for a city about the size of Washington , D.C. Nearby , 20,000 new housing units are sprouting from the rich Bucks County farmland ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . <P> When the Fairless Works is in full production next summer , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2% of the U.S. total and a big step toward easing the shortage ( see above ) . By that time Ben Fairless expects the new plant to be performing such tricks as rolling a sheet of steel 4 ft. wide at a speed of 80 m.p.h. , fastest in history .
