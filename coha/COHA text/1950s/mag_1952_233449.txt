Paris ' tough police force , bruised and angered by Communism 's May 28 Ridgway riots , made a shocking discovery last week . Two of the rioters whom they locked up and manhandled were Catholic priests in workmen 's clothes . Abbs Louis Bouyer , 35 , and Bernard Cagne , 28 , are ordained members of the Mission de Paris ; like 85 other French " worker priests " ( TIME , Feb. 27 , 1950 ) , they live and work with their flocks , do not always reveal themselves as priests , seek to convert by example as well as by precept . Bouyer earns his daily bread as a production hand in the Hispano Suiza plant ; Cagne in the Simca auto factory . Sometimes , say critics of the worker-priest scheme , it is the priests , not their fellow workers who get converted . <P> Thrown among the Communists in Paris ' suburban Red Belt , the abbs ' working-class enthusiasm got the better of them . When the Red workers marched , both priests joined in and were pinched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the newspapers and approved by the Archbishop of Paris , the abbs last week told their story . " Faithful to our connection with the working world , we found ourselves with everyday friends , Communists or not , Christians or not , who wanted to express in spite of government restrictions . . . hopes which can be translated by the following words : ' Ridgway in France means war . ' " <P> Once arrested , " we were scarcely across the threshold of the police station , when we were seized by 20 gendarmes . They hit us with their fists and cudgels ; when we were knocked down , they picked us up and started again . . . Then they put us in the cellar . We could only hold each other 's hand . " <P> Next morning at 9 , the police commissioner called the abbs into his office . As the priests told it , the commissioner first remarked : " I 'm an old seminarist myself . You are a partisan to violence instead of fraternity . " Then he bopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placards the Communists had used to beat up the cops . " I respect the priest , but not the man , " roared the officer . <P> Abb Bouyer came next . " False priest , bandit , priest of Stalin , " cried the police commissioner , " you want to destroy religion . " He clubbed Bouyer in the back . " Do you approve of this ? " an officer asked the abb , pointing to the iron head of a Communist club . " No , " quavered Bouyer , " but I understand it . " The commissioner poked it in his stomach . " Go ahead , get the hell out of here . " <P> Tears &; Questions . Paris ' Communist dailies wept crocodile tears over the handling of the priests . The respected Le Monde scolded the cops for " inexcusable brutality , " but sensibly added : " Was it really the priests ' place to take part in a political demonstration forbidden by the government ? " " Certainly not , " answered pipe-sucking Prefect of Police Jean Baylot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skull . " I do n't care if they 're ambassadors , priests , pastors , rabbis or candy salesmen . If they take part in an illegal demonstration , they will suffer the consequences . "
