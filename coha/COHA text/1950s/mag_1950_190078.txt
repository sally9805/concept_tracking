It was a measure of the critical stage of the war in Korea last week , for B-29s were never designed to do the work of tactical aircraft . <P> The Superfort crews were more at home in a 50-plane attack on the Chosen Nitrogen Co. plant at Hungnam , on the east coast of North Korea . Operated in World War II by the Japanese , the Hungnam plant was a major producer of glycerine , nitric and sulphuric acid . Huge quantities of explosives were presumed to be stored in the factory area . <P> Bombing by radar through a heavy overcast , the B-29 crews , flying at 15,000 feet , felt the shock of a great explosion . " Somebody , " commented " Rosie " O'Donnell , " must have hit something big . " Later photo reconnaissance showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another 55% damaged .
