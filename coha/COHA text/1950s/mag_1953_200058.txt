The Mormon Church outlawed polygamy 63 years ago , but tiny outlaw cults , defiantly devoted to plural marriage , have gone on springing up in out-of-the-way corners of the Southwest ever since . Back in the ' 30s half a dozen renegade Mormon fundamentalists and their women trekked into one of the wildest and loneliest areas left in the U.S.-the unpoliced , almost uninhabited strip of tumbled , gorge-cut Arizona desert north of the Grand Canyon . They settled there at the little shack town of Short Creek , beneath high red cliffs named the Towers of Tummurru . <P> By 1942 , the colony was formally organized as the United Effort , a communal settlement in which all wages , earnings and food were pooled . The FBI raided it in 1944 and made several arrests . But the colony kept growing ; its population reached 36 men , 86 women and 263 children . <P> A White-Slave Factory ? Two years ago the State of Arizona began casting about for a means of stamping out the cultists , their town and their way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be used in the project , and State Attorney General Ross F. Jones began planning a grandiose attack . Secret agents , some disguised as movie scouts , drifted into Short ' Creek . Last month the great " Love-nest raid " began to shape up in all its wondrous detail . <P> Arizona 's Governor Howard Pyle declared that the colonists were in a " state of insurrection . " Authorities alerted newspapers and press services weeks ahead of time . " This is a white-slave factory , " an assistant attorney general announced . " No woman has escaped this community for at least ten years . They are forced to submit to men old enough to be their grandfathers . " Warrants charging 122 adults with conspiracy to commit such crimes as polygamy , rape , bigamy and misappropriation of school funds were carefully drawn up . <P> Ten Million in Publicity . This week , with the ponderous secrecy of an elephant sneaking across a skating rink , the great invasion began . Sixty state troopers were assembled at the town of Williams , Ariz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined by 30 deputy sheriffs , twelve liquor inspectors , five police matrons , six welfare workers , three judges , the attorney general and three assistants , and squads of reporters and cameramen . They set out in two motorized caravans . One string of cars swung into Nevada and Utah to approach from the north ; the other cut across the Arizona strip to hit Short Creek from the east . An eclipse of the moon cloaked their movements . But as it turned out , the Short Creekers knew all about the raid , and had stationed boys along the road to shoot off dynamite and thus announce its arrival .
