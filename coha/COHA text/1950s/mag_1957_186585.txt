Dead Sea Scrolls <P> Sir : <P> Your extremely interesting and information April 15 article on the Dead Sea Scroll will do a lot to clear up most of the misconceptions concerning them in the public mind <P> JOAN SHERIFF Chicago <P> Sir : <P> Yours was the most lucidly written article I have yet read . However , the Maccabees are among the greatest of the Jewish heroes , and the suggestion that Jonathan and Simon may have been the villains of the story is not going to sit well with the Jews . <P> <P> JOSHUA L. BAILY JR . La Jolla , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I find most repugnant the unwarranted conclusions drawn from the Qumran scrolls and their relationship to the origin of the principles and practices of the Roman Catholic Church . <P> <P> LEO F. COLLIGNON San Francisco <P> Sir : <P> The Dead Sea Scrolls belong to the realm of Hollywood make-believers and the nearly dead myth of the Kensington Stone . <P> <P> A. R. NYKL <P> Evanston , Ill . <P> Sir : <P> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable solution to the question of where Jesus spent the years unaccounted for from twelve to 30 . It would be a reasonable conclusion that he was at Qumran . <P> <P> FRANCES G. A. MILLAR Alexander , Ark . <P> <P> Scroll Fragments <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on the article . I have also thoroughly enjoyed your symbolic cover composition and recognized the " scroll fragment , " having identified and translated this document myself in 1948 . I admire the skill of Artist Bohrod in being able to apply the Habakkuk commentary ( whose photographic plates were published in 1950 ) , hack out a portion of it , crumple it and tint it in simulating a scroll fragment . <P> WM . H. BROWN LEE Assistant Professor of Old Testament Duke University Divinity School Durham , N.C. <P> Sir : <P> Does the drawing in the sand on the left of the cover picture have any special meaning ? It looks suspiciously like the sign of the fish used by early Christians as a means of identifying themselves to others of their belief during periods of persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> <P> JANET CAMPBELL <P> Geneva , N.Y . Yes. - ED . <P> <P> Spreading Christianity <P> Sir : <P> When I read in your April 22 issue of the Protestant invasion of Catholic Italy , I wondered why they were there at all . If they are really sincere about spreading Christianity ( their form ) , why do n't they descend on Sweden ? Now there is a country that probably has the most lax moral standards of any country in the world and a country that is almost exclusively Protestant . But I have an idea that the Swedish people would n't take kindly to a swarm of missionaries . <P> <P> LARRY WINDLE Maywood , Ill . <P> Picture of Progress <P> Sir :
