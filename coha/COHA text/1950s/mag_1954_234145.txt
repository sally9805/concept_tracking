The inflow of doctors who have been poorly trained in foreign countries is threatening to undermine the standards of U.S. medical care , Columbia University 's Dean of Medicine warned last week . Unless something is done about it , Dr. Willard C. Rappleye told a Chicago conference on medical education , the U.S. will lose the benefits of a 40-year effort to raise its standards . <P> <P> Dr. Rappleye was not opposing the admission of all doctors trained abroad , - nor was he assailing their professional standards or ideals . But , he said , the simple fact is that many have had poor training in the basic sciences , and many more have not had enough experience in bedside care . When they reach the U.S. , there is no nationwide program for checking on their qualifications or for plugging gaps in their education . An internship in a U.S. hospital is no guarantee of the additional training they need , said Dr. Rappleye , because too many internships are in small or municipal hospitals that are strapped for funds and understaffed . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training . <P> The A.M.A. 's Dr. Edward L. Turner had a suggestion : let the National Board of Medical Examiners act for the 48 states in passing on the qualifications of foreign-trained doctors . With a single nationwide standard , he said , it would be easier to license those who are already qualified , and to find out what additional training the others need .. <P> <P> The great majority are aliens and displaced persons , though some are U.S. citizens who failed to get admittance to U.S. medical schools and sought training overseas .
