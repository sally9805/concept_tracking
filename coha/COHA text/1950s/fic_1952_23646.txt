Taxes and Your Telephone A considerable part of the money you pay for telephone service goes right out in taxes . . In fact , the total telephone tax bill last year averaged $2.70 per month for every Bell telephone in the country . It will be even higher this year . Taxes are necessary ... you could n't run a city , state or nation without them . But they do mount up . BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM The Duchess and the Smugs A Story by Pamela Frankau Drawings by Arthur Marokvia T HERE had been two crises already that day before the cook 's husband called to assassinate the cook . The stove caught fire in my presence ; the postman had fallen off his bicycle at the gate and been bitten by Charlemagne , our sheep dog , whose policy it was to attack people only when they were down . Whenever there were two crises my stepmother Jeanne said , " Jamais deux sans trois . " This morning she and Francis ( my father ) had debated whether the two things happening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore be said to have cleared matters up . I thought that they were wasting their time . In our household things went on and on and on happening . It was a hotel , which made the doom worse : it would have been remarkable to have two days without a crisis and even if we did , I doubted whether the rule would apply in reverse , so that we could augur a third . I was very fond of the word augur . I was not very fond of the cook . But when I was sitting on the terrace in the shade work-ing on my Anthology of Hates , and a man with a bristled chin told me in patois that he had come to kill her , I thought it just as well for her , though obviously disappointing for her husband , that she was off ? for the afternoon . He carried a knife that did not look particularly sharp ; he smelt of licorice , which meant that he had been drinking Pernod . He stamped up and down , making speeches about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salaud and many other words new to me and quite difficult to understand . I said at last , " Look , you ca n't do it now , because she has gone over to St. Raphael in the bus . But if you wait I will fetch my father . " I took the Anthology with me in case he started cutting it up . I went down the red rock steps that sloped from the garden to the pool . The garden looked the way it always looked , almost as brightly colored as the post cards of it that you could buy at the desk . There was purple bougainvillaea splashing down the white walls of the hotel ; there were hydrangeas of the exact shade of pink blotting paper ; there were huge silver-gray cacti and green umbrella pines against a sky that was darker blue than the sky in England . I could not love this garden . Always it seemed to me artificial , spiky with color , not quite true . My idea of a garden was a green lawn and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 saw that garden only once a year , in September . I could conjure it by repeating inside my head And autumn leaves of blood and gold That strew a Gloucester lane . Then the homesickness for the place that was not my home would make a sharp pain under my ribs . I was ashamed to feel so ; I could not talk about it : not even to Francis , with whom I could talk about most things . I CAME to the top of the steps and saw them lying around the pool , Francis and Jeanne and the two novelists who had come from Antibes for lunch . They were all flat on the yellow mattresses , talking . I said , " Excuse me for interrupting you , but the cook 's husband has come to assassinate the cook . " Francis got up quickly . He looked like Mephistopheles . There were gray streaks in his black hair ; all the lines of his face went upward and the pointed mustache followed the lines . His body was dark brown and hairy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was burned when the airplane was shot down , did not tan with the sun . " It 's a hot afternoon for an assassination , " said the male novelist as they ran up the steps together . " Perhaps , " said Francis , " he can be persuaded to wait until the evening . " " He will have to , " I said , " because the cook is in St. Raphael . I told him so . " " Penelope , " said my stepmother , sitting up on the yellow mattress , " you had better stay with us . " " But I am working on my book . " " All right , cherie ; work on it here . " The lady novelist , who had a sparkling , triangular face like a cat , said , " I wish you would read some of it to us . It will take our minds off the current bloodcurdling events . " I begged her to excuse me , adding that I did not anticipate any bloodcurdling events because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook would have to go in any case , but that her love for Laurent was of a purely spiritual character . I said , " Laurent is a smoothy , and I do not see how anybody could be in love with him . " " A certain smoothness is not out of place in a headwaiter , " said the lady novelist . I did not tell her my real reason for disliking Laurent ; he made jokes . I hated jokes more than anything . They came first in the Anthology : they occupied whole pages : I had dozens and dozens : it was a loose-leaf book , so that new variations of hates already listed could be inserted at will . Retiring from the conversation , I went to sit on the flat rock at the far end of the pool . Francis and the male novelist returned very soon . Francis came over to me . I shut the loose-leaf book . " The cook 's husband , " he said , " has decided against it . " " I thought he would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody you do not impart the intention to others . " " Do n't you want to swim ? " said Francis . " No , thank you . I 'm working . " " You could n't be sociable for half an hour ? " " I would rather not . " " I 'll write you down for RCI , " he threatened . RCI was Repulsive Children Incorporated , an imaginary foundation which Francis had invented a year before . It came about because a family consisting mainly of unusually spoiled children stayed at the hotel for two days , and were asked by Francis to leave on the third , although the rooms were booked for a month . According to Francis , RCI did a tremendous business and there were qualifying examinations wherein the children were tested for noise , bad manners , whining , and brutal conduct . I tried to pretend that I thought this funny . " Will you please let me work for a quarter of an hour ? " I asked him . " After all , I was disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " After which you qualify . " I N FACT I was not telling him the truth . I had a rendezvous at this hour every day . At four o'clock precisely I was sure of seeing the people from the next villa . I had watched them for ten days and I knew how Dante felt when lie waited for Beatrice to pass him on the Ponte Vecchio . Could one , I asked myself , he in love with four people at once ? The answer seemed to be Yes . These people had become a secret passion . The villa was called La Lezardi  --  re ; a large , stately pink shape with green shutters ; there was a gravel terrace , planted with orange trees and descending in tiers , to a pool that did not sprawl in a circle of red rocks as ours did , but was of smooth gray concrete . At the tip of this pool there was a real diving board . A long gleaming speedboat lay at anchor in the deep water . The stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the quality of Vikings ; the father and mother were tall , handsome , white-skinned , and fair-haired . The boy and girl followed the pattern . They looked as I should have preferred to look . ( I was as dark as Francis , and , according to the never-ceasing stream of personal remarks that seemed to be my lot at this time , I was much too thin . And not pretty . If my eyes were not so large I knew that I should be quite ugly . In Francis ' opinion , my face had character . " But this , as Miss Edith Cavell said of patriotism , " I told him , " is not enough . " ) Oh , to look like the Bradleys : to be the Bradleys , I thought , waiting for the Bradleys . They were far , august , and enchanted ; they wore the halo of being essentially English . They were Dad and Mum and Don and Eva . I spied on them like a huntress , strained my ears for their words , cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They swam before breakfast and again at ten , staying beside the pool all the morning . At a quarter to one the hell would ring from the villa for their lunch . Oh , the beautiful punctuality of those meals ! Sometimes we did not eat luncheon until three and although Jeanne told me to go and help myself from the kitchen , this was not the same thing at all . In the afternoon the Bradleys rested on their terrace in the shade . At four they came back to the pool . They went fishing or water-skiing . They were always doing something . They would go for drives in a magnificent gray car with a white hood that folded back . Sometimes they played a catching game beside the pool : or they did exercises in a row , With the father leading them . They hadcameras and butterfly nets and field-glasses . They never seemed to lie around and talk , the loathed recreation in which I was expected to join . I took Don and Eva to be twins ; and perhaps a year younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin would , I thought , be a most satisfying destiny . I would even have changed places with the youngest member of the Bradley family , a baby in a white perambulator with a white starched nurse in charge of it . If I could be the bahy , I should at least he sure of growing up and becoming a Bradley , in a white shirt and gray shorts . Their magic linked with the magic of my yearly fortnight in England , when , besides having the gray skies and the green garden , I had acquaintance with other English children not in the least like me : solid , pink-checked sorts with ponies ; they came over to tea at my aunt 's house and it was always more fun in anticipation than in fact , because I seemed to make them shy . And I could never tell them that I yearned for them . So , in a way , I was content to watch the Bradleys at a distance . I felt that it was hopeless to want to be friends with them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only different on the outside , but different on the inside , which was worse . On the front page of the Anthology I had written : " I was born to trouble as the sparks fly upward , " one of the more consoling quotations because it made the matter seem inevitable . N ow it was four o'clock . My reverie of the golden Bradleys became the fact of the golden Bradleys , strolling down to the water . Dad and Don were carrying the water-skis . I should have only a brief sight of them before they took the speedboat out into the bay . They would skim and turn far off , tantalizing small shapes on the shiny silky sea . Up on the third tier of the terrace , between the orange trees , the neat white nurse was pushing the perambulator . But she was only faintly touched with the romance that haloed the others . I mourned . Then a most fortunate thing happened . There was a drift of strong current around the rocks and as the speedboat moved out toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was carried into the pool under the point where I sat . Don dived in after it ; I ran down the slope of rock on their side , to shove it off from the edge of the pool . " Thanks most awfully , " he said . He held on to the fringed seaweed and hooked the water-ski under his free arm . Now that he was so close to me I could see that he had freckles ; it was a friendly smile and he spoke in the chuffy , English boy 's voice that I liked . " It 's rather fun , water-skiing . " " It looks fun . I have never done it . " " Would you like to come out with us ? " he jerked his head towards the boat : " Dad 's a frightfully good teacher . " I groaned within me , like the king in the Old Testament . Here were the gates of Paradise opening and I must let them shut again , or be written down for RCI. - Painful as it is to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors and I have sworn to be sociable . The penalty is ostracism . " ( Ostracism was another word that appealed to me . ) Don , swinging on the seaweed , gave a gurgle of laughter . " What 's funny ? " I asked . " I 'm terribly sorry . Was n't that meant to be funny ? " " Was n't what meant to be funny ? " " The way you talked . " " No. it 's just the way I talk , " I said , drooping with sadness . " I like it awfully , " said Don . This was warming to my heart . By now the speedboat was alongside the rock point . I could see the Viking heads ; the delectable faces in detail . Mr. Bradley called : " Coining aboard ? " " She ca n't , " said Don . " Her father has visitors ; she 'll he ostracized . " He was still giggling and his voice shook . " Oh dear , that 's too bad , " said Mrs. Bradley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come tomorrow ? " " I will , most certainly , " I said , though I knew that I need never ask permission of Jeanne or Francis for anything that I wanted to do . I felt as though I had been addressed by a goddess . Don gurgled again . He flashed through the water and they pulled him into the boat . I had to wait for a few minutes alone , hugging my happiness , preparing a kind of vizor to pull down over it when I went back to the group on the yellow mattresses . " Making friends with the Smugs ? " ' Francis greeted me . " What an enchanting name , " said the lady novelist . " It is n't their name ; it 's what they are , " said Francis . I heard my own voice asking thinly : " Why do you call them that ? " He shocked me so much that my heart began to beat heavily and I shivered . I tried to conceal this by sitting crouched and hugging my knees . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " he said gently . I had given myself away . He had guessed that they meant something to me . " I do n't know . I do n't think so . I want to know why you think so . " " Partly from observation , " said Francis . " Their gift for organized leisure ; their continual instructions to their children : the expressions on their faces . And the one brief conversation that I 've conducted with Bradley  --  he congratulated me on being able to ? " No , thank you . I 'm working . " engage in a commercial enterprise on French soil . According to Bradley , you can never trust the French . " He imitated the chuffy English voice . " Is n't ' commercial enterprise ' rather an optimistic description of Chez Francois ? " asked the lady novelist , and the male novelist laughed . Francis was still looking at me . " Why do you like them , Penelope ? " I replied with chilled dignity : " I did not say that I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . " Jeanne said quickly : " That will be fun . You know , Francis , you are becoming too intolerant of your own countrymen : it is enough in these days for you to meet an Englishman to make you dislike him . " This was comforting ; I could think this and feel better . Nothing , I thought , could make me feel worse than for Francis to attack the Bradleys . It was another proof that my loves , like my hates , must remain secret , and this was loneliness . II I AWOKE next morning full of a wild surmise . I went down early to the pool and watched Francis taking off for Marseilles in his small , ramshackle seaplane . He flew in a circle over the garden as be always did , and when the seaplane 's long boots pointed for the west , I saw Don and Eva Bradley standing still on the gravel terrace to watch it . They were coming down to the pool alone . Offering myself to them , I went out to the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that your father flying the seaplane ? " " Yes . " " Does he take you up in it ? " " Sometimes . " " Come and swim with us , " Don called . I ran down the rock slope on their side . I was shy now that we stood together . I saw that Eva was a little taller than Don ; that she also was freckled : and that they had oiled their skins against sunburn as the grownups did . Don wore white trunks and Eva a white swimming suit . They laughed when I shook hands with them , and Don made me an elaborate bow after the handshake . Then they laughed again . " Are you French or English ? " That saddened me . I said , " I am English , but I live here because my stepmother is a " Do n't famous people come here ? " Frenchwoman and my father likes the Riviera . " " We know that , " said Don quickly . " He was shot clown and taken prisoner by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lie ? " " Yes . That is how he met Jeanne , " " And he 's Francis Wells , the poet ? " " Yes . " " And the hotel is quite mad , is n't it ? " " Indubitably , " I said . It was another of my favorite words . Eva doubled up with laughter . ' ' Oh , that 's wonderful I 'm always going to say indubitably . " " Is it true , " Don said , " that guests only get served if your father likes the look of them , and that he charges nothing sometimes , and that all the rooms stay empty for weeks if he wants them to ? " " It is true . It does not seem to me the most intelligent way of running an hotel , but that is none of my business . " " Is he very rich ? " asked Eva . Don said quickly : " Do n't , Eva , that 's not polite . " " He is n't rich or poor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bradleys any more than I could explain them to myself . Some-times we had money . When we had not , we were never poor in the way that other people were poor . We were " broke " which , as far as I could see , meant being in debt but living as usual and talking about money . " Do you go to school in England ? " " No , " I said , handing over my chief shame . " I am a day boarder at a convent school near Grasse . It is called Notre Dame des Oliviers . " " Do you like it ? " " I find it unobjectionable , " I said . It would have been disloyal to Francis and Jeanne to tell these how little I liked it . " Do they teach the same things as English schools ? " " Roughly . " " I expect you 're awfully clever , " said Eva , " and top at everything . " How did she know that ? Strenuously , I denied it . Heading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one more way of calling attention to myself . It was part of the doom of being noticeable , of not being like Other People . At Les Oliviers , Other People were French girls , strictly brought up , formally religious , cut to a foreign pattern . I did not want to be they , as I wanted to be the Bradleys : I merely envied their uniformity . God forbid that I should tell the Bradleys about winning a special prize for a sonnet ; about being chosen to recite Racine to hordes of parents ; about any of it . I defended myself by asking questions in my turn . Eva went to an English boarding school in Sussex ; Don would go to his first term at public school this autumn . I had gUessed their ages correctly . They were just thirteen . " Home " was Devonshire . " I would greatly love to live in England , " I said . " I 'd far rather live in an hotel on the French Riviera . Lucky Penelope . " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How heavenly . What sort of dooms ? " " For example , getting an electric shock in science class , and finding a whole nest of mice in my desk , " I said . " And being the only person present when a lunatic arrived believing the school to be Paradise . " " Go on . Go on , " they said . " It 's wonderful . Those are n't dooms , they are adventures . " " Nothing that happens all the time is anadventure , " I said . " The hotel is also doomed . " They turned their heads to look up at it ; from here , through the pines and the cactus , we could see the red crinkled tiles of its roof , the bougainvillaea , the top of the painted blue sign that announced " Chez Francois . " " It ca n't be doomed , " Don said . " Do n't famous people come here ? " " Oh yes . But famous people are more subject to dooms than ordinary people . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Important telegrams containing money do not arrive . Their wives leave them ; they are recalled on matters of state . " " Does Winston Churchill come ? " " Yes . " " And Lord Beaverbrook and Elsa Maxwell and the Duke of Windsor and Somerset Maugham ? " " Yes . Frequently . All their signed photographs are kept in the bar . Would you care to see them ? " Here I encountered the first piece of Bradley dogma . Don and Eva , who were splashing water on each other 's hair ( " Dad is most particular about our not getting sunstroke " ) looked doubtful . " We would love to . " " I 'm sure it 's all right , Eva ; because she lives there . " " I do n't know . I think we ought to ask first . It is a bar , after all . " Ashamed , I hid from them the fact that I often served in the bar when Laurent was off duty . " Oh , do let 's chance it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " R. AND Mrs. Bradley had gone over to Nice and would not return until the afternoon , so a deadlock threatened . The white starched nurse appeared at eleven o'clock with a Thermos-flask of cold milk and a plate of buns . I gave birth to a brilliant idea ; I told her that my stepmother had invited Don and Eva to lunch with us . It was a little difficult to convince them after the nurse had gone , that Jeanne would be pleased to have them to lunch without an invitation . When I led them up through our garden , they treated it as an adventure , like tiger shooting . Jeanne welcomed them , as I had foretold , and the lunch was highly successful , although it contained several things , such as moules , which the Bradleys were not allowed to eat . We had the terrace to ourselves . Several cars drove up and their owners were told politely that lunch could not be served to them . This delighted Don and Eva . They were even more delighted when Jeanne told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notice : " Keep Out ; This Means You , " printed in seventeen languages . One mystery about the Bradleys was that they seemed to like jokes . They thought that I made jokes . When they laughed at my phrases they did not laugh as the grownups did , but in the manner of an appreciative audience receiving a comedian . Eva would hold her stomach and cry : " Oh stop ! It hurts to giggle like this ; it really li tuts . " I took them on a tour of the hotel . The salon was furnished with some good Empire pieces . The bedrooms were not like hotel bedrooms , but more like rooms in clean French farmhouses , with pale walls and dark wood and chintz . All the rooms had balconies where the guests could eat their breakfast . There were no guests . " And Dad says people clamor to stay here in the season , " Don said , straddled in the last doorway . " Yes , they do . Probably some will be allowed in at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duchess is arriving from Venice at any moment and Francis always waits for her to choose which room she wants , before he lets any . She is changeable . " Eva said , " I ca n't get over your calling your father Francis . Who is the Duchess ? " " The Duchessa di Tenacini . She is half Italian and half American . " " Is she very beautiful ? " " Very far from it . She is seventy and she looks like a figure out of a waxworks . She was celebrated for her lovers but now she only loves roulette . " I did not wish to be uncharitable about the Duchess , whose visit was to be dreaded , and these were the nicest things that I could make myself say . The only thing in her favor was that she had been a friend of my mother , who was American and utterly beautiful and whom I did not remember . " Lovers ? " Eva said , looking half pleased and half horrified . Don flushed and looked at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mention of the facts of life could be like this . I knew also that Francis despised the expression , " the facts of life , " because , he said , it sounded as though all the other things that happened in life were figments of the imagination . " A great many people loved the Duchess desperately , " I said . " She was engaged to an Austrian Emperor ; he gave her emeralds , but somebody shot him . " " Oh well , then , she 's practically history , is n't she ? " Eva said , looking relieved . TIT I MIGHT have known that the end of the day would bring doom . It came hard upon the exquisite pleasure of my time in the speedboat with the Bradleys . This was even better than I had planned it in anticipation , a rare gift . I thought that the occasion must be under the patronage of a benign saint or what the Duchess would call a favorable aura ; the only worry was Mrs. Bradley 's worry about my having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with typical Bradley organization there were an extra white shirt and gray shorts in the boat . Dressed thus I felt like a third twin . The sea changed color ; the sea began to be white and the rocks a darker red . " Would you like to come back and have supper with us , Penelope ? " I replied , " I can imagine nothing that I would like more . " " She does say wonderful things , does n't she ? " said Eva . I was drunk by now on Bradley admiration and almost reconciled to personal remarks . " Penelope speaks very nice English , " said Mrs. Bradley . " Wilt you ask your stepmother then ? " she added as we tied up the boat . I was about to say this was unnecessary when Don gave my ribs a portentous nudge ; he said quickly , " Eva and I will walk you up there . " It was obvious that the hotel exercised as much fascination for them as they for me . When the three of us set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , now ! " and Eva made a grimace . She said , " Would n't it be nice not to have to be punctual for anything ? " " I never have to be , " I said , " except at school , and I think that I prefer it to having no timetable at all . " " Oh , my goodness ! Why ? " " I like days to have a shape , " I said . " Can you just stay out to supper when you want to ? Always ? Without telling them ? " " Oh , yes . " " What would happen if you stayed away a whole night ? " I said that I had never tried . And now we went into the bar because Don said that he wanted to see the photographs again . Laurent was there ; straw-colored and supercilious in his white coat . He began to make his jokes : " Mesdames , monsieur , bon soir . What may I serve you ? A Pernod ? A champagne cocktail ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each drink , muttering under his breath , " Alois non ; c'est terrible ; we have nothing that pleases our distinguished visitors . " I saw that the Bradleys were enchanted with him . We walked all round the gallery of photographs and were lingering beside Winston Churchill when the worst thing happened . I heard it coming . One could always hear the Duchess coming . She made peals of laughter that sounded like opera ; the words came fast and high between the peals . And here she was , escorted by Francis . She cried , " Ah my love , my love , " and I was swept into a complicated , painful embrace . scratched by her jewelery , crushed against her stays , and choked with her scent before I got a chance to see her in perspective . When I did , I saw that there were changes since last year and that these were for the worse . Her hair , which had been dyed black , was now dyed bright red . Her powder was whiter and thicker than ever ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelashes of great length that made her look like a Jersey cow . She wore a dress of dark blue chiffon , sewn all over with sequin stars , and long red gloves with her rings on the outside ; she tilted back on her heels , small and bony , gesticulating with the gloves . " Beautiful ? beautiful ? beautiful ! " was one of her slogans . She said it now ; she could not conceivably mean me ; she just meant everything . The liradleys had become awed and limp all over . NVhen I introduced them they shook hands jerkily , snatching theirhands away at once . Francis took from Laurent the bottle of champagne that had been on ice awaiting the Duchess ; he carried it to her favorite table , the corner table beside the window . She placed upon the table a sequin bag of size , a long chiffon scarf , and a small jeweled box that held bonbons au miel , my least favorite sweets , reminding me of scented glue . Francis uncorked the champagne . " But glasses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A glass for each . " The Bradleys said , " No thank you very much , " so quickly that they made it sound like one syllable and I imitated them . " But how good for you , " cried the Duchess . " The vitalizing , the magnificent , the harmless grape . All children should take a little to combat the lassitude and depressions of growth . My mother used to give me a glass every morning after my fencing lesson . Et toi , Penelope ? More than once last year you have taken your petit - berre with me . " " Oh , did n't you know ? Penelope is on the water wagon , " said Francis , and the Duchess again laughed like opera . She cried , " Santd , sang ! " raising her glass to each of us . Francis helped himself to a Pernod and perched on the bar , swinging his legs . The Bradleys and I stood in a straight , uncomfortable row . " Of youth , " said the Duchess , " I recall three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though one were swimming against a current ; the insipid insincerity of one 's teachers ; and bad dreams , chiefly about giants . " Sometimes she expected an answer to statements of this character ; at other times she went on talking : I had known her to continue without a break for fifteen minutes . " I used to dream about giants , " said Eva . " How old are you , Miss ? " " Thirteen . " " At fifteen the dreams become passionate , " said the Duchess , sounding lugubrious about it . 44 FIAT do you dream about now ? " asked Don , who had not removed his eyes from her since she came . " Packing ; missing airplanes ; losing my clothes , " said the Duchess . " Worry  --  worryworry ; but one is never bored in a dream , which is more than can be said for real life . Give me your hand , " she snapped at Eva . She pored over it a moment , and then said briskly , " You are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest life ; always be careful in automobiles . " Don 's hand was already stretched out and waiting . She gave him two wives , a successful business career , and an accident " involving a horse between the ages of twenty and twenty-three . " " That is tolerably old for a horse , " Francis interrupted . " Sh-h , " said the Duchess , " perhaps while steeplechasing ; it is not serious . " She blew me a little kiss : " Penelope I already know . She is as clear to me as a book written by an angel . Let me see if there is any change , " she commanded , a medical note in her voice : " Beautiful  --  beautiful  --  beautiful ! Genius and fame and passion , are all here . " " Any dough ? " asked Francis . " I beg your pardon , " said the Duchess , who knew perfectly well what dough meant , but who always refused to recognize American slang " I refer to cash , " said Francis looking " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" I have ordered our dinner , Penelope . It is to be the ecrevisses au gratin that you like , with small goziters of caviar to begin with and raises des bois in kirsch afterward . " I had been anticipating this hurdle ; she always insisted that I dine with her on her first evening , before she went to the Casino at nine o'clock . " I am very sorry , Duchessa ; you must excuse me . I am having supper with Don and Eva . " I saw Francis raise one eyebrow at me . " I really did n't know you were coming tonight , " I pleaded . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I am very disappointed . I have come to regard it as a regular tryst . " She put her head on one side . " Why do you not all three stay and dine with me ?

" But we could n't possibly . Supper 's at seven and Mum 's expecting us . " " Thank you very much , though , " said Don , who was still staring at her . " Could we do it another time ? " " But of course ! Tomorrow ; what could be better ? Except tonight , " said the Duchess . " I was looking to Penelope to bring me good luck .

And tell him further that all European Casinos are of the highest order of probity , with the possible exception of Estoril and Budapest . Do you know the game ? " When the Bradleys said that they did not , she took from her bag one of the cards that had upon it a replica of the wheel and the cloth . She embarked upon a roulette lesson . The Bradleys were fascinated and of course we were late for supper . Francis delayed me further , holding me back to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have supper with the Smugs ? " " Please do n't call them that . Yes , I do . " " It would be reasonable , I should think , to send a message saying that an old friend of the family had arrived unexpectedly . " Of course it would have been reasonable ; Mrs. Bradley had expected me to ask permission . But nothing would have made me stay . " I 'm extremely sorry , Francis ; I ca n't do it . " You should know how much it means to her . She has ordered your favorite dinner . All right , " he said , " I see that it is useless to appeal to your better nature . Tonight you qualify for RCI . " He went back to the bar , calling , " The verdict can always be withdrawn if the candidate shows compensating behavior . " " Did n't you want to stay and dine with the Duchess ? " asked Don , as we raced through the twilit garden . " I did not . She embarrasses me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do hope Mum and Dad will let us have dinner with her tomorrow . " " But do n't say it 's ? crevisses , Don , whatever you do . There 's always a row about shell fish , " Eva reminded him . " I would n't be such an ass , " Don said . " And the only thing that would give it away would be if you were ill afterward . " " Why should it be me ? " " Because it usually is , " said Don . I AWOKE with a sense of doom . I lay under my mosquito curtain , playing the scenes of last evening through in my mind . A slight chill upon the Viking parents , due to our being late ; smiles pressed down over crossness , because of the visitor . Don and Eva pouring forth a miscellany of information about the Duchess and the signed photographs ; myself making mental notes , a devoted sociologist studying a favorite tribe : grace before supper ; no garlic in anything ; copies of Punch and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The secret that I found in the Cotswold house was here , I told myself ; the house in Devonshire took shape ; on the walls there were photographs of it ; a stream ran through the garden ; they rode their ponies on Dartmoor ; they had two wire-haired terriers called Snip and Snap . I collected more evidence of Bradley organization : an expedition tomorrow to the Saracen village near Brignoles ; a Current-Affairs Quiz that was given to the family by their father once a month . No , I said to myself , brooding under my mosquito net , nothing went wrong until after the apple pie . That was when Eva had said , " The Duchess told all our fortunes . " The lines spoken were still in my head : Don saying , " Pene/ope 's was an absolute fizzer ; the Duchess says she will have genius , fame , and passion . " Mr. Bradley 's Viking profile becoming stony ; Mrs. Bradley 's smooth white forehead puckering a little as she asked me gently , " Who is this wonderful lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and Mrs. Bradley remarking that this was a beautiful name . But Mr. Bradley 's stony face growing stonier and his officer-tomen voice saying , " Have we all finished ? " ; then rising so that we rose too and pushed in our chairs and bowed our heads while he said grace . After that there was a spirited game of Monopoly . " But the atmosphere , " I said to myself , " went on being peculiar . " I had waited for Don and Eva to comment on it when they walked me home , but they were in a rollicking mood and appeared to have noticed nothing . " Indubitably there is a doom , " I thought while I put on my swimming suit , " and since I shall not see them until this evening because of the Saracen village , I shall not know what it is . " As I crossed the terrace , the Duchess popped her head out of the corner window above me ; she leaned like a little gargoyle above the bou-gainvillaea ; she wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good morning , Duchessa . Did you win ? " " I lost consistently , and your friends can not come to dine tonight , as you may know ; so disappointing , though the note itself is courteous . " She dropped it into my hands . It was written by Mrs. Bradley ; fat , curly handwriting on paper headed CROSSWAYS CHAGFORD DEVON It thanked the Duchess and regretted that owing to the expedition , Don and Eva would not be able to accept her kind invitation to supper . I knew that the Bradleys would be back by six . Iv I SPENT most of the day alone working on the Anthology . I had found quite a new Hate , which was headed " Characters . " People called the Duchess a character and this was said to others who came here . I made a brief description of each and included some of their sayings and habits . There was the usual paragraph about the Duchess in the Continental Daily Mail ; it referred to her gambling and her emeralds and her joie-de-vivre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I entered it on a separate page , as a subsection of Jokes . At half-past-four , to my surprise , I looked up from my rock writing desk and saw the Bradleys ' car sweeping in from the road . Presently Eva came running down the tiers of terrace alone . When she saw me she waved , put her finger to her lips , and signaled to me to stay where I was . She came scrambling up . " I 'm so glad to see you . There 's a row . I ca n't stay long . Don has been sent to bed . " " Oh , dear . I was conscious of an unfavorable aura , " I said . " What happened ? " Eva looked miserable . " It is n't anything against you , of course . They like you terribly . Mum says you have beautiful manners . When Don and I said we wanted you to come and stop a few days with us at Crossways in September , it went down quite well . Would you like to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it be awfully boring ? " MAGAZINE I was momentarily deflected from the doom and the row . " I can not imagine anything that would give me greater pleasure , " I said . She wriggled her eyebrows , as usual , at my phrases . " That is n't just being polite ? " " I swear by yonder horned moon it is n't . " " But of course it may not happen now , " she said in melancholy , " although it was n't your fault . After all you did n't make us meet the Duchess on purpose . " " Was the row about the Duchess ? " " Mm  --  m . " " Because of her telling your fortunes and teaching you to play roulette ? I did have my doubts , I admit . " " Apparently they were quite cross about that , but of course they could n't say so in front of you . Daddy had heard of the Duchess , anyway . And they cracked down on the dinner party and sent a note . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there seems to have been something in the Continental Mail , which we are not allowed to read . " " Here it is , " I said helpfully . She glanced upward over her shoulder . I said , " Have no fear . We are invisible from the villa at this angle . " She raised her head from the paper and her eyes shone ; she said , " Is n't it wonderful ? " I had thought it a pedestrian little paragraph , but I hid my views . " Mummy said that the Duchess was n't at all the sort of person she liked us to mix with , and that no lady would sit in a bar drinking champagne when there were children present , and that we should n't have gone into the bar again anyway . And Don lost his temper and was quite rude . So that we came home early instead of having tea out ; and Dad said that Don had spoiled the day and asked him to apologize . And Don said a word that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Which is awful for him because he 's too big to be sent to bed . And I 'll have to go back . I 'm terribly sorry . " " So am I , " I said . " Please tell you mother that I deplore the Duchess deeply , and that I always have . " As soon . as I had spoken , I became leaden inside myself with remorse . It was true that I deplored the Duchess because she was possessive , overpowering , and embarrass-ing , but I did not disapprove of her in the way that the Bradleys did . I was making a desperate effort to salvage the thing that mattered most to rne . In other words , I was assuming a virtue though I had it not , and while Shakespeare seemed to approve of this practice , I was certain that it was wrong . ( And I went on with it . I added that Francis would not have dreamed of bringing the Duchess into the bar if he had known that we were there . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchess into the bar if the Archbishop of Canterbury were there  --  admittedly an unlikely contingency . ) When Eva said that this might improve matters and might also make it easier for Don to apologize , because he had stuck up for the.Duchess , I felt lower than the worms . Which is why I quarreled with Francis . And knew that was why . I had discovered that if one were feeling guilty one 's instinct was to put the blame on somebody else as soon as possible . Francis called to me from the bar door as I came up onto the terrace . I had been freed from RCI on the grounds of having replaced Laurent before lunch at short notice . He grinned at me . " Be an angel and take these cigarettes to Violetta 's room , will you , please ? I swear that woman smokes two at a time . " " I am sorry , " I said . " I have no wish to run errands for the Duchess just now . " Francis , as usual , was reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . I told him about the Bradleys , about the possible invitation to Devonshire ; I said that , thanks to the Duchess cutting such a pretty figure in the bar , not to mention the Continental Mail , my future was being seriously jeopardized . I saw Francis ' eyebrows twitching . He said , " Penelope , you are a thundering ass . These people are tedious petits bourgeois , and there is no reason to put on their act just because you happen to like their children . And I see no cause to protect anybody , whether aged seven or seventy , from the sight of Violetta drinking champagne . " " Mrs. Bradley said that no lady would behave in such a way . " " Tell Mrs. Bradley with my love and a kiss that if she were a tenth as much of a lady as Violetta she would have cause for pride . And I am not at all sure , " he said , " that I like the idea of your staying with them in Devonshire . " This was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean that you would n't let me go ? " I asked , feeling as though I had been struck by lightning . " I did not say that . I said I was n't sure that I liked the idea . " " My God , why not ? " " Do not imagine when you say , ' My God , ' " said Francis , " that you add strength to your protest . You merely add violence . " He could always make me feel a fool when he wanted to . And I could see that he was angry ; less with me than with the Bradleys . He said , " I do n't think much of the Smugs , darling , as you know . And I think less after this . Violetta is a very remarkable old girl , and if they knew what she went through in Rome when the Germans were there , some of that heroism might penetrate even their thick heads . Run along with those cigarettes now , will you please ? " I was trembling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as everything else . I took the cigarettes with what I hoped was a dignified gesture , and went . T tiE Duchess was lying on the chaise longue under her window ; she was swathed like a mummy in yards of cyclamen chiffon trimmed with marabou . She appeared to be reading three books at once : a novel by Ignazio Silone , Brewer 's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable , and a Handbook of Carpentry for Beginners . The room , the best of the rooms , having two balconies , had become unrecognizable . It worried me with its rampaging disorder Three wardrobe trunks crowded it : many dresses , scarves , and pairs of small pointed shoes had escaped from the wardrobe trunks . The Duchess always brought with her large unexplained pieces of material ; squares of velvet , crepe de chine , and damask , which she spread over the furniture . The writing table had been made to look like a table in a museum ; she had put upon it a black crucifix and two iron candlesticks , a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the heat of the afternoon the windows were shut ; the room smelled of smoke and scent . " Beautiful  --  beautiful  --  beautiful ! " said the Duchess , holding out her hands for the cigarettes . " There are the bonbons au oriel on the bedside table . Help yourself liberally , and sit down and talk to me . " " No , thank you very much . If you will excuse me , Duchcssa , I have to do some work now . " " I will not excuse you , darling . Sit down here . Do you know why I will not excuse you ? " I shook my head . " Because I can see that you arc unhappy , frustrated , and restless . " She joined her fingertips and stared at me over the top of them . " Some of it I can guess , " she said , " and some of it I should dearly like to know . Your mother would have known . " I was silent ; she was hypnotic when she spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her questions . " Genius is not a comfortable possession . What do you want to do most in the world , Penelope ? " The truthful reply would have been , " To be like other people . To live in England ; with an ordinary father and mother who do not keep a hotel . To stop having dooms ; never to be told that I am a genius , and to have people of my own age to play with so that I need not spend my life listening to grownups . " I said , " I do n't know . " The Duchess sighed and beat a tattoo with her little feet inside the marabou ; they looked like clock-work feet . " You are , beyond doubt , crying for the moon . Everybody at your age cries for the moon . But if you will not tell me which moon , I can not be of assistance . What is the book that you are writing ? " " It is an Anthology of Hates , " I said , and was much surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . " Oho , " said the Duchess . " Have you enough Hates to make an anthology ? " I nodded . " Is freedom one of your hates ? " I frowned ; I did not want to discuss the book with her at all and I could not understand her question . She was smiling in a maddening way that implied more knowledge of me than I myself had . " Freedom is the most important thing that MAGAZINE there is . You have more freedom than the average child knows . One day you will learn to value this and be grateful for it . I will tell you why . " Her voice had taken on the singsong , lecturing note that preceded a fifteen-minute monologue . I stared at the figures on the writing table . She had let her cigarette lie burning in the ash tray , and a small spiral of smoke went up like incense before the crucifix ; there was this , there was the hot scented room and the sound of her voice : " It is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their protection . In schools , they are largely hidden away from life , like bees in a hive . This means that they learn a measure of pleasant untruth ; a scale of simple inadequate values that resemble the true values in life only as much as a plain colored poster of the Riviera resembles the actual coastline . " When they emerge from the kindly-seeming prisons , they meet the world of true dimensions and true values . These are unexpectedly painful and irregular . Reality is always irregular and generally painful . To be unprepared for its shocks and to receive the shocks upon a foundation of innocence is the process of growing up . In your case , Penelope , you will be spared many of those pains . Not only do you have now a wealth of freedom which you can not value because you have not experienced the opposite , but you are also endowing yourself with a future freedom ; freedom from the fear and shock and shyness which make the transition from youth to maturity more uncomfortable than any other period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back-to. front . You are learning what the adult learns , and walking through these lessons toward the light-heartedness that is usually to be found in childhood but lost later . I wonder how long it will take you to find that out . " She sat up on her elbows and stared at me again . " Do you know what I think will happen to your Anthology of Hates when you do find it out ? You will read it through and find that these are not Hates any more . " By this last remark she had annoyed me profoundly , and now she clapped her hands and cried , " If young people were only allowed to gamble ! It takes the mind off every anxiety . If I could take you to the Casino with me tonight , Penelope ! Would n't that be splendid ? Disguised as a young lady of fashion ! " She sprang off the chaise longue , snatched the square of velvet from the bed and flung it over my shoulders . Its weight almost bore me to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musty . " Look at yourself in the mirror ! " cried the Duchess . " Beautiful  --  beautifulbeautiful ! A Principessa ! " She scuttled past me . " We will place this silver girdle here . " She lashed it so tightly that it hurt my stomach ; I was stifled ; it felt like being dressed in a carpet . " Take this fan and these gloves . " They were long white kid gloves , as hard as biscuits ; she forced my fingers in and cajoled the gloves up my arms as far as the shoulders . The little amethyst circlet for your head . " She caught some single hairs as she adjusted it and put one finger in my eye . Sweat was trickling all over me . " Now you have a very distinct k resemblance to your mother , " said the Duchess , standing before me and regarding me with her head on one side . " This is the forecast of your womanhood . Will you please go downstairs at once and show yourself to Jeanne ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I struggled out of the ridiculous costume ; hot , dispirited , no fonder of myself than before , I got away . V Y BEDROOM was on the ground floor , with a window that opened onto the far end of the terrace . It was late , but I was still awake and heard Francis and Jeanne talking outside . I did not mean to listen , but their voices were clear and when I heard the name " Bradley " I could not help listening . ? -I agree with you , " Jeanne said , " that it is all an outrageous fuss . But these Bradleys mean a great deal to Penelope . " " Wish I knew why , " said Francis . " They represent the worst and dullest aspect of English ' county ' ; a breed that may soon become extinct and no loss , either . " They are the kind of friends that she has never had ; English children of her own age . " Their footsteps ceased directly outside my window . I heard Francis sigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you think ? " " Perhaps next year . " " That will be too late , beloved . " I had heard him call Jeanne " beloved " before , but tonight the word touched my heart , perhaps because I was already unhappy ; it made me want to cry . " She will be fifteen , " Francis said . " First she 'll kill herself trying to fit into the pattern and if she succeeds in the task , we shall never see her again . God knows what we 'll get but it wo n't be Penel-ope . " " She will change in any case , whether she stays or goes , darling ; they always do . " " Perhaps I 've done a poor job with her from the beginning , " Francis said : he spoke my mother 's name . And then I was so sure I must listen no more , that I covered my ears with my hands . When I took them away Jeanne was saying , " You are always sad when your back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite the Bradley children for lunch again ; on Thursday when Violetta 's in Monte Carlo . " " Why should we suck up to the Smugs ? " Francis grumbled , and Jeanne replied , " Only because of Penelope , to le sass , " and they walked away down the terrace . I wept because they destroyed my defenses ; my conscience still troubled me for the speeches of humbug that I had made to Eva , for quarreling with Francis , and for being uncivil to the Duchess . It was a weary load . If ' the Bradleys accepted the invitation to lunch , it would seem that God was not intending to punish me for it , but exactly the reverse , and that was a bewildering state of affairs . By morning , however , God 's plan became clear . Jeanne brought me my breakfast on the terrace . She sat with me while I ate it . I thought , as I had thought before , that she looked very young ; more an elder sister than a stepmother , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brown face , the long slim brown legs . She smoked a caporal cigarette . I could hardly wait for her to tell me whether she had healed the breach with the Bradleys . But I dared not ask . Their talk on the terrace had been too intimate for me to admit that I had heard it . She said , " Penelope , the situation with your friends at La Lezardiere has become a little complex . " My heart beat downward heavily and I did not want fo eat any more . " I thought that it would give you pleasure if I asked them to lunch and would perhaps clear up any misunderstanding . But I have been talking to Mrs. Bradley and apparently she would prefer them not to visit the hotel . " I did not know whether I was blushing for the hotel , for my own disappointment , or for the Bradleys ; I was only aware of the blush , flaming all over my skin , most uncomfortably . " Mrs. Bradley was friendly and polite , you must not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you like ; she said that she hoped you would go out in the speedboat again . But her exact phrase was , ' We feel that the hotel surroundings are just a little too grown-up for Don and Eva . ' " I was silent . " So , I thought that I would tell you . And ask you not to be unhappy about it . People are entitled to their views , you know , even when one does not oneself agree with them . " " Thank you , Jeanne : I am not at all unhappy , " I said , wishing that my voice would not shake . " And if the Bradleys will not come to me , I am damned if I am going to them . " And I rose from the table . She came after me , but when she saw that I was near to tears she gave me a pat on the back and left me alone . T uns was the point at which I discovered that hate did riot cast out love , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate and love at the same time . I could not turn off my infatuation for the Bradleys , much as I longed to do so . They were still the desirable Vikings . The stately pink villa above the orange trees , the gray rocks where the diving board jutted and the speedboat lay at anchor , remained the site of romance , the target of forlorn hopes . It hurt me to shake my head and retire from the flat rock when Don and Eva beckoned me . They seemed to understand quickly enough , more quickly than their parents did . Mr. Bradley still called , " Coining aboard ? " and Mrs. Bradley waved to me elaborately on every possible occasion . The children turned their heads away . For two days I saw them all like figures set behind a glass screen ; only the echo of their voices reached me ; I gave up haunting the beach and worked in a corner of the garden ; the regularity of their timetable made it easy to avoid the sight of them . I told myself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Don and Eva were both candidates for RCI . I even considered including them in the Anthology of Hates , but I found it too difficult . Now they had indeed become the moon that the Duchess told me I cried for . I cherished dreams of saving Don 's life or Eva 's at great risk to myself , and being humbly thanked and praised by their parents . Then I hoped that they would all die in a fire , or better still that I would die and they would come to my funeral . In these two days I found myself looking at my home differently ; seeing it in Bradley perspective . I had been plagued by the crises and irregularities but never ashamed of them . Was I ashamed now ? I could not be sure ; the feeling was one of extra detachment and perception ; I was more than ever aware of the garden 's bright colors , of the garlic smells from the kitchen , of the dusky coolness in the bar ; every time that I walked through the salon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eyes : " It 's pretty , of course ; it 's like a little room in a museum , but it is n't the sort of place where one wants to sit . " The terrace with the blue and white umbrellas above the tables , the stone jars on the balustrade , the lizards flickering along the wall , seemed as temporary as the deck of a ship on a short voyage . I felt as though I were staying here , not living here . And there was no consolation in my own room with my own books because here the saddest thoughts came and they seemed to hang in the room waiting for me , as palpable as the tented mosquito net above the bed . I found that I was seeing Francis , Jeanne , and the Duchess through a grotesque lens ; they were at once complete strangers and people whom I knew intimately . I could place them in a Bradley context , thinking , " That is Francis Wells , the poet , the poet who keeps the mad hotel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like Mephistopheles when he laughs . And that is his wife , his second wife ; younger than he is ; very gay always , is n't she ? What very short shorts . And there goes the Duchessa di Tcrracini , rather a terrible old lady who gambles at the Casino and drinks champagne ; does n't she look ridiculous in all that make-up and chiffon ? " And then I would be talking to them in my own voice and with my own thoughts and feeling like a traitor . I knew that they were sorry for me ; that Francis above all approved my defiant refusal . I was aware of their hands held hack from consoling gestures , to spare me too much overt sympathy . Even the Duchess did not speak to me of the Bradleys . For once I welcomed the crises as diversion . And these two days naturally were not free from crisis ; a British ambassador and his wifefound themselves en panne at our gates . All the entrails of their car fell out upon the road and we were obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not of itself have been other than a mechanical crisis , because the ambassador and Francis were old friends . Unfortunately the ambassador and the press baron from Cap d'Ail , who was dining with the Duchess , were old enemies . So a fierce political fight was waged in the bar , with both elderly gentlemen calling each other poltroon , and they would have fought a duel had not the electric current failed and the hotel been plunged in darkness till morning . ( My only grief was that Don and Eva had missed it . All roads led to the Bradleys . ) On the third morning , which was Thursday , doom accelerated . 1 woke to find Francis standing beside my bed . " Sorry , darling ; trouble , " he said . " A telephone call just came through from Aix ; Jeanne 's mother is very ill and I 'm going to drive her over there now . Can you take care of you for today ? " He never asked me such questions : this was like a secret signal saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . " " But of course . Please do n't worry . " " There are no guests , thank God . Violetta 's going over to Monte Carlo ; Laurent will be in charge tonight . You might see that he locks up , if I 'm not back . " " I will do that . " " But do n't let him lock Violetta out , for Heaven 's sake . " " I will see that he does not . Can I help Jeanne or do anything for you ? " " No , my love . We are off now . 1 ' 11 telephone you later . " He ducked under the mosquito curtain to kiss me . " You must pray rather than worry , " the Duchess said to me , standing on the doorstep . For her expedition to Monte Carlo , she wore a coat and skirt of white shantung , a bottle-green frilly blouse , and the usual chiffon scarf . She was topped by a bottle-green tricorn hat with a green veil descending from it . " Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling on her white gloves . I could feel little emotion for my step-grandmother who lived in seclusion near Aix- en-Provence , but I was sorry for Jeanne . " The best thing that you could do , Penelope , " said the Duchess , grasping her parasol like a spear , " would he to come over with me to Monte Carlo . We will lunch delightfully on the balcony of the Hotel de Paris ; then you shall eat ices while I am at the tables ; then a little stroll and a little glass and we could dine on the port at Villefranche and drive home under the moon . The moon is at the full tonight and I look forward to it . Viens , cherie , ca to changera les Wes , " she added , holding out her hand . I thanked her very much and said that I would rather stay here . When she was placed inside the high purple Isotta-Fraschini , I thought that she and her old hooky chauffeur looked like a Punchand-Judy show . The car was box-shaped with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moved off . I waved good-by . T HE first part of the day seemed endless . I sat in the garden on a stone bench under the largest of the umbrella pines . That way I had my back to La Lezardiere . I could hear their voices and that was all . When the bell rang for their lunch , I went down to the pool and swam . I swam for longer than usual ; then I climbed to the flat rock and lay in the sun . I was almost asleep when I heard Eva 's voice . " Penelope ! " She was halfway up the rock ; she said , " Look ; we are so miserable we 've written you this note . I have to go back and rest now . " She was like a vision out of the long past ; the freckles , the sunburn , and the wet hair . I watched her scuttle down and she turned to wave to me from the lowest tier of the terrace . I gave her a half-wave and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be cross with us . Mum and Dad are going out to supper tonight . Do n't you think that you could come ? They have asked us to ask you .

Owing to severe illness in the family my father and stepmother have left for Aix . I feel it necessary to stay here and keep an eye on things . Penelope . To run no risk of meeting them , I went into the bar and asked Laurent if he would be so kind as to leave this note at La Lezardiere . Laurent was in one of his moods ; he replied sarcastically that it gave him great pleasure to run errands and do favors for young ladies who had not the energy to perform these for themselves . I echoed the former cook 's husband , the assassin , and said , " Salaud , " but not until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I alternated between wishing that I had accepted and wishing that I had given them more truthful reasons for my refusal . Later , I sought comfort by writing to my aunt in England ; I sat there conjuring the fortnight as it would be and putting in the letter long descriptions of the things that I wanted to see and do again . It helped . I had covered twelve pages when the telephone rang . Francis ' voice spoke over a bad line : " Hello , Child of Confusion . Everything all right ? " " Yes , indeed . Nothing is happening at all . What is the news ? " " Better , " he said , " But Jeanne will have to stay . I may be very late getting back . See that Laurent gives you the cold lobster . Jeanne sends her 16ve . " Nothing would have induced me to ask Laurent for my dinner , but I was perfectly capable of getting it myself and the reference to cold lobster had made me hungry . No reason why I should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way to the kitchen by way of the terrace when I heard a voice calling me : " Penelope ! " I turned , feeling that horrible all-over blush begin . Mrs. Bradley stood at the doorway from the salon onto the terrace . She looked golden and statuesque in a white dress with a scarlet belt . The sight of her was painful . It seemed as though I had forgotten how lovely she was . " May I talk to you a moment , my dear ? " " Please do , " I said , growing hotter and hotter . " Shall we sit here ? " She took a chair beneath one of the blue and white umbrellas . She motioned to me to take the other chair . I said , " Thank you , but I prefer to stand . " S HE smiled at me . T could feel in my heart the alarming collision of love and hate and now I could see her in two contexts ; as a separate symbol , the enemy ; as a beloved haunting of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom I had made my private possession . Her arms and hands were beautifully shaped , pale brown now against the white of her dress . " Ca n't we be friends , Penelope ? I - think we can , you know , if we try . Don and Eva are so sad and it all seems such a pity . " I said , " But , Mrs. Bradley , you made it happen . " " No , dear . That is what I want to put right . When I talked to your stepmother , I made it quite clear that we all hoped to see much more of you . " " But , " I said , " that Don and Eva could n't come here . As though it were an awful place . " She put her hand on mine ; she gave a soft low laugh . " Penelope , how foolish of you . Of course it is n't an awful place . You have just imagined our thinking that , you silly child . " " Did I imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept her hand on mine . " I expect that what 1 said about the Duchess was quite a little exaggerated to you by Eva and Don . That was an uncomfortable day for all of us . We do n't often quarrel in our family ; I do n't suppose that you do , either . Quarrels are upsetting to everybody and nobody likes them . " " Certainly , " I said , " I do n't like them . " " Let 's try to end this one , Penelope . " Did she guess how badly I wanted to end it ? I could not tell . " Supposing , " she said , " that you let me put my point of view to you , as one grown-up person to another . You are very grown-up for your age , you know . " " I do know , and I deplore it . " She gave another little low laugh . " Well , I should n't go on deploring it if I were you . Think what a dull world it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winced inside at the clich ? because Francis had taught me to wince at cliches . But I pretended that she had not said it . She went on : " Listen , dear . Just because you are so grownup and this place is your home , you have avery different life from the life that Don and Eva have . I 'm not saying that one sort of life is right and the other wrong . They just happen to be different . Now , my husband and I have to judge what is good for Don and Eva , do n't we ? You 'll agree ? Just as your father and stepmother have to judge what is good for you . " " Yes . I agree to that . " It sounded reasonable ; the persuasion of her manner was beginning to.work . " Well , we think that they are n't quite grown-up enough yet to understand and appreciate all the things that you understand and appreciate . That 's all . It 's as though you had a stronger digestion and could eat foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was still silent , she added , " I think you should . Your stepmother saw perfectly . " " I suppose I see . " " Do try . " In fact I was trying hard ; but the struggle was different from the struggle that she imagined . I felt as though I were being pulled over the line in a tug of war . Inside me there was a voice saying , " No , no . This is wrong . Nothing that she says can make it right . It is not a matter of seeing her point of view ; you can see it ; she has sold it to you . But you must n't surrender . " Oddly , the voice seemed to be the voice of the Duchess . I felt as though the Duchess were inside me , arguing . I looked into the lovely , smiling face . " Do try , " Mrs. Bradley repeated . " And do please come and have supper with the children tonight . Let 's start all over again ; shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had won . I found myself in her arms and she was kissing my hair . I heard her say , " Poor little girl . " VI 0 NLY the smallest shadow stayed in my heart and I forgot it for long minutes . We talked our heads off . It was like meeting them again after years . I found myself quoting in my head : " And among the grass shall find the golden dice wherewith we played of yore . " They still loved me ; they still laughed at everything I said . When I ended the description of the ambassador fighting the press baron and the failure of fir ? ? ? . IIP ? the electric lights , they were sobbing in sepa-rate corners of the sofa . " Go on ; go on . What did the Duchess do ? " " I think she enjoyed it mightily . She had an electric torch in her bag and she flashed OL. it over them both like a searchlight . " " You do have the loveliest time , " said Eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don . " In fact I think 1 heard her car come back about ten minutes ago . " I began to describe the car and the chauffeur . " Older than the Duchess ? He ca n't be . I 'd love to see them bouncing away under the fringe . Let 's go out and look . " " Too late , " I said . " At night he takes the car to the garage in Theoule . " " Hark , though , " Don said . " There 's a car now . " He ran to the window ; but I knew that it was n't the Isotta-Fraschini . It was the putt-putt noise of Laurent 's little Peugeot . " How exactly like Laurent , " I said . " As soon as the Duchess gets home , he goes out for the evening . And Francis has left him in charge . " It occurred to me now that I should go back . I reminded myself that Charlemagne was an effective watchdog . But I was not comfortable about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchess to bed ? Undo her stays ; help her off with her wig ? " " It is n't a wig ; it 's her own hair , and she requires no help . But I do think I should go back . The telephone may ring . " " Well then , the Duchess will answer " She will not . She claims that she never answered a telephone in her life . She regards them as an intrusion upon privacy . " " Is n't there anybody else in the hotel ? " " No . " " Oh you ca n't go yet , " said Eva . I sat on a little longer . Then I knew that it was no good . " I shall have remorse if I do n't , " I said , " and that is the worst thing . " " All right , then . We 'll go with you . " " Oh , Don ? " said Eva . " Mum and Dad wo n't be back yet awhile , " said Don , " and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be furious . " " We wo n't tell them. - Eva looked at me . I said , " I can not decide for you . I only know I must go . " " Of course if you want to stay behind , " Don said to Eva . " Of course I do n't . What shall we say to Nanny ? " We can say we went down to the beach . " W E CREPT out , silent in the spirit of adventure . The moon had risen , the full moon , promised by the Duchess , enormous and silver and sad ; its light made a splendid path over the sea ; the palms and the orange trees , the rock shapes on the water , were all sharp and black . " Here we go on Tom Tiddler 's ground , " Eva sang . We took the short cut , scrambling through the oleander hedge instead of going round by the gate , I could hear Don panting with excitement beside me . Almost , their mood could persuade me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace and darted into the empty bar ; Laurent had turned off the lights ; I turned them up for the Bradleys to look at the photographs . " What 'll we drink ? " said Don facetiously , hopping onto a stool . " Champagne , " said Eva . " If the Duchess was still awake , she 'd give us some champagne . " " You would n't drink it , " said Eva . " I would . " " You wouldn't. " " 1 jolly %veil would . " " She 's probably in the salon , " I said . " She never goes to bed early . " I put out the lights again and led them to the salon by way of the terrace . The salon lights were lit . We looked through the windows . " There she is , " said Don . " She 's lying on the sofa . " They bounded in ahead of me . I heard Don say , " Good evening , Duchessa , " and Eva echoed it . There was no reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still staring at her . She was propped on the Empire sofa ; her red head had fallen sideways on the stiff satin cushion . Her little pointed shoes and thin ankles stuck out from the hem of her shantung skirt and the skirt , which was of great width , drooped down over the edge of the sofa to the floor . On the table beside her she had placed the green tricorn hat , the green scarf , and her green velvet bag . A bottle of champagne stood in an ice pail ; the glass had fallen to the floor ; since one of her arms dangled limply , I thought that she must have dropped the glass as she went off to sleep . " Please wake up , Duchessa ; we want some champagne , " said Don . He took a step forward and peered into her face , which was turned away from us . " She looks sort of horrid , " he said ; " I think she 's ill . " For no reason that I could understand I felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to her . When he turned back to us , I saw that his face was pale ; the freckles were standing out distinctly on the bridge of his nose . " She is ill , I 'm sure , " he said . " She 's unconscious . " He looked at the bottle of champagne . " She must be ? " He stopped . I saw that he thought that the Duchess was intoxicated and that he could not bring himself to say so . " Let 's go , " Eva said in a thin scared voice . She grabbed Don 's hand . " Come on , Penelope . Quick . " " But of course I 'm not coining . " They halted . " You ca n't stay here , " Don said . Eva was shivering . There was no sound nor movement from the figure on the sofa . I said , " Certainly I can stay here . What else can I do ? If she is ill , I must look after her . " I saw them straining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very young indeed . " But we ca n't stay here , " Eva said . " Oh , please , Penelope , come with us . " " No indeed . But you go , " I said . " It 's what you want to do is n't it ? " " It 's what we ought to do , " Eva stammered through chattering teeth . Don looked a little more doubtful . " Look here , Penelope , you need n't stay with her . When they  --  they get like that , they sleep it off . " Now I was angry with him . " Please go at once . " I said . " This is my affair . And I know what you mean and it is n't true . " I found that I had clapped my hands to shoo them off ; they went ; I heard the panic rush of their feet on the terrace . I was alone with the Duchess . ? ow that they - were gone ; I had no hesitation in approaching her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only me , " and I bent above her as Don had done . I saw what he had seen ; the shrunken look of the white face with the false eyelashes . Indeed she looked shrunken all over , like a very old doll . I lowered my head until my ear touched the green frilled chiffon at her breast . I listened for the beat of her heart . When I could not hear it , I lifted the little pointed hand and felt the wrist . There was no pulse here that I could find . I despised myself because I began to shiver as Eva Bradley had shivered . My fingers would not stay still ; it was difficult to unfasten the clasp of the green velvet bag . I thought that there would be a pocket mirror inside and that I must hold this to her lips . Searching for the mirror I found other treasures ; the ivory hand that she had aimed at Francis , a cut-glass smelling-bottle , some colored plaques from the Casino , a chain holding a watch , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , was in a folding morocco case with visiting cards in the pocket on the other side . I said , " Fxcuse me , please , Duchessa , " as I held it in front of her face . I held it there a long time ; when I took it away the bright surface was un-clouded . I knew that the Duchess was dead . A profound curiosity took away my fear . I had never seen a person lying dead before . It was so strange to think of someone I knew well , as having stopped . But the more I stared at her , the less she looked as though she had stopped ; rather , she had gone . This was not the Duchess lying here ; it was a little old doll , a toy thing of which the Duchess had now no need . Where , I wondered , had she gone ? What had happened to all the things that she remembered , the fencing lessons , and the child 's dreams , and the Emperor ? What happened , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head ? Did they go on with your soul or would a soul not want them ? What did a soul want ? Did the Duchess 's soul like roulette ? Theology had never been my strongest subject and I found myself baffled by the rush of abstract questions flowing through my mind . Then I became aware of her in relation to me . It was impossible to believe that I would not talk to her again . I was suddenly deeply sorry that I had not dined with her on the first evening , that I had not gone down in the fancy-dress to show myself to Jeanne . She had asked me to do this ; she had asked me to come to Monte Carlo with her . " Neils ; aerie , ca to changera les idees . " Always she had been kind . I had not . I had never been nice to her because she embarrassed me and now I should never have another chance to be nice to her . Automatically I began to perform small meaningless services . I covered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head so that it made a dignified veil . I fetched a ru , , and laid it across her feet ; I did not want to see the little shoes . I carried the untouched champagne back to the bar . I lifted her tricorn hat , her bag and gloves off the table ; I took them up to.her room . It was more difficult to be in her room , with the bed turned down and the night clothes laid there , than it was to be in the salon with her body . I put the hat , bag , and gloves down on the nearest chair and I was running out when 1 saw the crucifix on the table . I thought that she might be pleased to have this near her ( " Although , " 1 said to myself , " she is n't there any more , one still goes on behaving as if she is " ) , and I carried it down ; I set it on the table beside her . There seemed to be too many lights here now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a suitable place for her to lie in state , the elegant little shell of a room with the Empire furnishings . I pulled a high-backed chair from the wall , set it at the foot of the sofa , and sat down to watch with her . Outside the windows the moonlight lay in the garden . I heard her saying . " The moon is at the full tonight . I look forward to it . " 1 heard her saying , " Naturally , you cry for the moon . " I heard her saying , " Death is a part of life , " as she pulled on her white gloves . T INTERVALS I was afraid again ; the fear came and went like intermittent sea- sickness . I did not know what brought it . She was so small and still and gone that 1 could not fear her . But 1 felt as though I were waiting for a dreadful thing to walk upon the terrace , and the only poem that would stay in my head was one that had always frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ae nighte , this ae nighte , Evcrye nighte and alle , Fire and sleet and candlelyte , And Christe receive thy saule . It made shivers down my back . I would have liked to fetch Charlemagne from his kennel , but I had heard that dogs howled in the presence of the dead and this I did not want . Sitting there so stiffly I became terribly tired : " But it is a vigil , " I said to myself , " and it is all that I can do for her . " It was not much . It was no true atonement for having failed her in kindness ; it could not remit my having betrayed her to the Bradleys . It seemed hours since I had thought of the Bradleys . Now I wondered whether the parents had returned , and with the question there came incredulity that Don and Eva should not have come back . They had simply run off and left me , because they were afraid . The memory of their scared faces made them small and silly in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my talk with Mrs. Bradley : the talk that had left a shadow . I admitted the shadow now : it was the note of patronage at the end of all the spellbinding . She had called me " poor little girl . " " You never called me poor little girl , " I said in my thoughts to the Duchess . She had called me fortunate and a genius . She had spoken to me of the world , of freedom and maturity . That was truly grown-up conversation . In comparison the echo of Mrs. Bradley saying , " As one grown-up person to another , " sounded fraudulent . Some of the magic had left the Bradleys tonight . I was so tired . I did not mean to sleep , because this was vigil . But I found my head falling forward and the moonlight kept vanishing and the Duchess ' voice was quite loud in my ears . " Of death , " she said , " I remember three things ; being tired , being quiet , and being gone . That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not hear her . She went on calling , " Penelope ! Penelope ! " I sat up with a start . Somebody was in fact calling - Penelope " : a man 's voice from the terrace . I climbed down stiffly from the chair . " Who 's that ? " I asked , my voice sounding cracked and dry . Mr. Bradley stood against the moonlight . " Arc you there , child ? Yes , you are . Come along out of this at once . " He looked large and golden and worried ; he seized my hand ; then he saw the Duchess on the sofa . " Lord , " he said . " She 's still out , is she ? " He started again . " Did you cover her up like that ? " " Yes . Please talk quietly , " I said . " She is dead . " He dropped my hand , lifted the scarf a little way from her face , and put it back . I saw him looking at the crucifix . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like it . 1 am watching by her , " I said . He looked pale , ruffled , not the way , I thought , that grown-up people should look . " I 'm terribly sorry , " he said in a subdued voice . " Terribly sorry . Young Don came along to our room , said he could n't sleep for knowing you were over here with her . Of course he did n't think ? " " I know what he thought , Mr. Bradley , " I said coldly . " Don and Eva are only babies really . Thank you for coming , just the same . " He said , in his officer-to-men voice , " Out of here now . There 's a good girl . " " I beg your pardon ? " " You 're coming to our house . I 'll telephone the doctor from there . " He took my hand again ; I pulled it free . " I 'll stay with her , please . You telephone the doctor . " He looked down at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " No , no , no . Penelope . You must n't stay . " I said , " I must . " " No , you must n't . You ca n't do her any good . " " It is a vigil . " " That 's just morbid and foolish . You 're coming over to our house now . " " I am not . " " Yes , you are , " he said , and he picked me up in his arms . To struggle in the presence of the Duchess would have been unseemly . I remained tractable , staying in his arms until he had carried me onto the terrace . He began to put me down and at once I twisted free . " I 'm not coming with you . I 'm staying with her . She is my friend and she is not your friend . You were rude about her , and stupid , " I said to him . H E CRABBED me again and I fought : he imprisoned me with my arms to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift me . He simply held me there . " Listen , Penelope , do n't be hysterical . I 'm doing what 's best for you . That 's all . You ca n't possibly sit up all night alone with the poor old lady ; it 's nearly one o'clock now . " " I shall stay with her till dawn ; and she is nut a poor old lady , just because she is dead . That is a ridiculous clich ? . " I was aware of his face close to mine , the stony , regular features , the blue eyes and clipped mustache in the moonlight . The face seemed to struggle for speech . Then it said , " I do n't want insolence any more than I want hysteria . You just pipe down and come along . This is no place for you . " " It is my home , " I said . He shook me gently . " Have some sense , will you ? I would n't let my kids do what you 're doing and I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , " would n't want to do it anyway ; they arc , in vulgar parlance , a couple of sissies . " At this he lifted me off my feet again and I struck at his face . I had the absurd idea that the Duchess had come to stand in the doorway and was cheering me on . And at this moment there came the miracle . The noise of the car sweeping in from the road was not the little noise of Laurent 's car , but the roaring powerful engine that meant that Francis had come home . The headlights swung yellow upon the moonlit garden . Still aloft in Mr. Bradley 's clutch I said , " That is my father , who will be able to handle the situation with dignity . " He set me down as Francis braked the car and jumped out . " That you , Bradley ? " said Francis . " What , precisely , are you doing ? " Mr. Bradley said , " I am trying to make your daughter behave in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Francis came up the steps onto the terrace . He sounded so weary that I knew his back hurt him : " Why should it be your concern to make my daughter behave in any manner whatsoever ? " " Really , Wells , you 'll have to know the story . There 's been a tragedy here tonight , I 'm afraid . Just doing what I could to help . " " I will tell him , " I said . I was grateful for Francis ' arm holding me ; my legs had begun to feel as though they were made of spaghetti . " You let me do the talking . young woman , " said Mr. Bradley . " If you do n't mind , I 'd prefer to hear it from Penelope , " said Francis . I told him . I told him slowly , leaving out none of it ; there seemed less and less breath in my lungs as I continued . " And Mr. Bradley called it morbid and foolish and removed me by force , " I ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Francis . - Damn it , look at the state she 's in ! " " Part of which might be due to your methods of persuasion , do n't you think ? All right , Penelope , easy now . " I could not stop shivering . " Leaving her alone like that in a place like this . You ought to be ashamed of your-self , " Mr. Bradley boomed . " Quiet , please , " said Francis in his most icy voice . " Damned if I 'll be quiet . It 's a disgrace and I do n't want any part of it . " " Nobody , " I said , " asked you to take any part in it , Mr. Bradley . " MAGAZINE " Flush , " said Francis . " Mr. Bradley meant to be kind and you must be grateful . " " I am not in the least . " " Fine manners you teach her , " said Mr. Bradley . " Quiet , please , " said Francis again . " Penelope has perfect manners , mitigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of overstrain . " Looking up at him , I could see the neat Mepliistophelean profile , the delicate shape of his head . I loved him more than I had ever loved him . Mr. Bradley , large and blowing like a bull , was outside this picture , nothing to do with either of us . Suddenly he looked as though he realized this . He said : " I do n't want my wife or my kids mixed up in it either . " " Mixed up in what , precisely ? " Francis asked . I said , " It is possible that he is referring to the inquest . Or do you mean mixed up with me ? Because if you do , no problem should arise . After tonight I have not the slightest wish to be mixed up with them or you . " It would have been more effective had I been able to stop shivering ; I was also feeling rather sick , never a help when attempting to make dignified speeches . Mr. Bradley faded away in the moonlight . Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to say those things in anger . " " I think I meant it . Was the vigil , in your opinion , the right thing to do ? " " It was . I am very pleased with you . " I said , " But I am not sure that I can continue with it for a moment . I feel funny . " Francis took me into the bar ; he poured out a glass of brandy and a glass of water , making me drink them in alternate swallows . " Of . course , " he said gloomily , " it may make you sick . In which event the last state will be worse than the first . " But it did not ; it made me warm . " They ca n't help being the Smugs , can they ? " I said suddenly , and then for the first time I wanted to cry . " They 're all right , " said Francis . " They are merely lacking in imagination . " I managed to say , " Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked me to cry . This time he said , watching me , " On some occasions it is better to weep . " I put my head down on the table and sobbed , " If only she could come back ; I would be nice . " Francis said , " You gave her great pleasure always . " " Oh , not enough . " " Nobody can give anybody enough . " " Not ever ? " " No , not ever . But one must go on trying . " " And does n't one ever value people until they are gone ? " " Rarely , " said Francis . I went on weeping ; I saw how little I had valued him ; how little I had valued anything that was mine . Presently he said , " Do you think that you can cry quite comfortably by yourself for a few minutes because I must telephone the doctor ? " Though I said , " Yes , indeed , " I stopped crying immediately . As I sat waiting for him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love that was ended , and to my dream of being like other people . The next day I tore the Anthology of Hates into pieces and cast the pieces into the sea . I did not read through the pages first , so certain was I that I had done with hating.
