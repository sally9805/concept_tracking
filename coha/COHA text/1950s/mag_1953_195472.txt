The Communist general secretary of Britain 's non-Communist coal miners ' union is a twittery little Welshman named Arthur Horner . At 12 he was a wobbler ( the boy who lathers customers ' faces in barbershops ) ; in his teens , he was a Baptist preacher , calling on the coalowners to repent of their " anti-working-class sins " before it was too late . In &; out of jail , " Li'l Arthur " Horner worked wonders for the miners , and they loved him for it . Most of them thought he was simply daft when he announced , in 1947 , that " if there were a possibility of war with Russia , the British coal fields would stop . " <P> Of late , Arthur Horner has been overworked and ill . His doctor , a die-hard Tory , ordered absolute rest ; the coal miners ' union generously offered to pay for a long spring vacation , his first in 15 years . Last week Li'l Arthur announced that he 'd get well in a nice quiet rest home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet medicine . " <P> " It was my own idea , " says Arthur , glowing with pride . " I was in Russia nine times before the war , and I know their . . . rehabilitation centers . They 're wonderful . " He hopes to be sent to the sunny Black Sea coast-perhaps to the very spot where his friend , French Communist Boss Maurice Thorez , spent two years demonstrating his faith in Soviet medicine before returning to Paris , an aging invalid ( TIME , April 20 ) . " They 'll probably give me electrical treatment and sulphur bath . . . I 'll just put myself in the hands of their doctors . I 'll go on the bill of the Russian miners , I suppose , " Li'l Arthur said . " I 'll see you in five weeks . . . and you wo n't know me . . . "
