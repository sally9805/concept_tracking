txt HOLADAY NAMED TO SPUR DEFENSE AGAINST MISSILES He Will Coordinate Army , and Air Force Work Until Space Unit Is Formed CHOSEN FIRST DIRECTOR Action Taken , to Head Off Interservice Rivalries ? Roles are Redefined By JACK RAYMOND Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Jan. 18 ? The Defense Department assumed Itop responsibility today for the anti-missile weapon development programs now being carried on separately in the Army - land Air Force . An announcement emphasized today that " no significant change can be made in these programs without the specific approval of the director of A. R. P. A. " This was a reference to the Advance Research Projects Agency , which is being set up for the development of outer space weapons . Legislation to organize the new unit is now before Congress . Until the space agency is organized , William M. Holaday , Defense Department director for guided missiles , will serve as its director . The work on defense against missiles includes the effort to perfect anti - missile missiles , weapons designed to locate , track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as contra - missiles or " missile killers . " Progress Is Noted Iri-its announcement , the Defense Department said that the development efforts in this field had been " progressing steadily . " " In fact , " it noted , " this program has advanced to the point that a second missile and missile launching system has been proposed for development . " This was an apparent reference to the Air Force 's Wizard program . The first anti-missile missile design to reach an advanced stage is ' understood to be the Army 's Nike-Zeus . Today 's order appeared to be an effort to head off a possible new inter-service rivalry , similar to the one that characterized the Army ' and Air Force intermediate-range ballistic missile projects . Advances in technology had dictated a modification in the // Memorandum on roles and misSkin issued in November of 1958 by Charles E. Wilson , then Secretary of Defense , the announcement said . Under the old memorandum , the Army was assigned responsibilities of " point defense " against air attack and the Air Force responsibilities of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that these definitions might not apply to the defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles ? the 5,000-mile range weapons that would approach targets from hundreds of miles above the earth . Realizing that further clarification of responsibilities was rmuired , the Pentagon antftweinent went . on , Neil H. , Secretary of Defense , has sent memorandums to the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force . The Air Force was ordered to concentrate " as a matter of urgency " on that part of the Wizard program pertaining to the radar and data-handling aspects of ballistic missile defense . The Army was directed to continue its current development in the Nike-Zeus program , also " as a matter of urgency . " It will concentrate on the effort to demonstrate that an effective defense against ICBM is feasible . This appeared to give the Army a broader role in the antimissile field , one that it has sought for some time . Army studies have indicated that it is possible to develop weapons that can destroy incoming ballistic missiles before they reached the target area , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to possible rivalry , the statement today declared : " Both services are directed to arrange for the closest possible cooperation among contractors so that the ultimate , system to be developed by the director of A. R. P. A. will find that all of these major system components Will be mutually compatible . " President Eisenhower , in his Budget Message and in an earlier request for supplemental appropriations for the Curren fiscal year , has indicated that more than $500,000,000 will be spent in the first research and development stage of antimissile missiles . The announcement on the anti-missile missile development organization was an obvious step in the Administration 's still-undisclosed Pentagon reorganization plans . President Eisenhower had said in his State of the Union Message that he would send reorganiaation proposals to Congress . But he added in a subsequent news conference that the reorganization itself must reflect a consensus of the Cabinet , Pentagon officials and Congress . It appeared today that the President faced a challenge to spell out his own detailed concent for a reorganization of the military establishment . " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts declared . He is House-Democratic majority leader . " He 's the Commander in Chief , " Mr. McCormack continued . " He has the responsibility of letting Congress know his views . Certainly his views would be worthy of and should receive consideration . " President Eisenhower once supported the idea of a single chief of staff  --  even putting all forces in the same uniform . But he has not outlined his beliefs on this subject in recent years . The Senate Preparedness subcommittee is planning to call a recess in its hearings in a few days , probably Wednesday , it became known . The Senate group will also deal with the Pentagon organization problem . At the Capitol today protests were voiced against the President 's request for authority to transfer $2,000,000,000 in appropriated funds as well as his request for a contingency fund of $500,000,000 . The President said he wanted the money to deal with unforeseen technological breakthroughs in weapons development . Senator Allen J. Mender , Democrat of Louisiana , said he would oppose any " blank check " for missiles , satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
