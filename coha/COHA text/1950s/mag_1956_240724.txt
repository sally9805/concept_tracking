The Democratic campaign bounced merrily and fruitfully through the week-as Maine voters rolled up their victory and Democratic dollars rolled heavily into the campaign fund-but the party 's chief candidate conversely seemed to be having his troubles . It was characteristic of Adlai Stevenson 's week that whenever he loosened up and turned on the charm , he was a snappy hit ; but before TV cameras and big audiences Adlai sadly sagged . <P> Making the rounds of eight regional party pep gatherings from Santa Fe to Hartford , the Stevenson smile , quip and zip were at their captivating best ( said Campaign Manager Jim Finnegan : the meetings were " little short of sensational " ) . At Manhattan 's Ambassador Hotel , where 250 of the best-heeled Democrats turned out to pledge $350,000 to the fund , the candidate was in fine fettle ( " I 'm delighted to see a group so distinguished-and so solvent " ) . In Harrisburg , Pa. he laced his arms around the waists of a couple of " farmerette " Stevenson supporters , joshed away as photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are my girls . . . I think we ought to practice coming in here every night " ) . He showed perhaps a more profitable political acumen in Harrisburg when he dispatched Running Mate Estes Kefauver to a hotel to cheer up 650 Ladies of the G.A.R. , who waxed fuming because they had not been able to get an audience with President Eisenhower in Gettysburg . <P> " One of the Best . " Yet the onstage Adlai was in comparatively dull fettle . In Albany he devoted three pages of a five-page speech in homage to New York 's roster of eminent Democrats ( Roosevelt , Lehman , Al Smith ) , not neglecting recent foes Averell Harriman and Carmine De Sapio . Nor was his attack on the Eisenhower Administration any more resounding than the calling of the roll : a " false front " administration , he called it , where Eisenhower appointees were undercutting programs , e.g. , public housing , conservation , which had progressed under the Democratic administrations . Many a New York Democratic conventioneer sat on his hands . <P> Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of New York 's Liberal Party , the highly sophisticated audience that Stevenson is most at home with . ( Said Adlai : " An exceedingly responsive audience , one of the best . " ) Here Stevenson let loose with penetrating wit and fine oratorical style , twitted the Republicans for contradictory statements ( on neutralism , the meaning of Russia 's reduction of its army , the importance of the Suez crisis ) , came out foursquare for compliance with the Supreme Court decision on segregation .
