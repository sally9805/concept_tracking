Eisenhower returned to New York yesterday from a 6,300-mile , nine-day campaign swing throjigh the country , cheeped by the size and enthusiasm of the crowds that turned out to see him and ready , in his words , to lead the nation to " peace , sanity and solvency " if he is elected President .

Just after he entered his car at New York International Airport , Idlewild , Queens , for the trip to his home at 60 Morningside Drive , one reporter stuck his head in the door and asked if he were going to support Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , who won a landslide victory for renomination in Tuesday 's Wiscons4 primary . " No comment , " General Eisenhower responded . Because none of the sixty or more reporters and commentators who accompanied him on his trip was present at the time , his answer was interpreted as a refusal to discuss the subject with only one reporter rather than an indication he had undergone any change of mind , Would Support All Candidates Before the Wisconsin primary he had said le would support Senator McCarthy , if he were renominated , along with other Republican candidates for Congressional offices . The General had been under pressure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin lawmaker in his fight on alleged Communist influences in the State Department . Looking tired after his long trip , the General went directly from the airport to his home . He is scheduled to remain in New York until Sunday when he will leave by train for his first cross-country campaign tour . He will use most of the intervening time to write speeches for delivery on the new trip , to stake campaign films for use over , television and to hold a further series of political conferences .

On the outcome of these.conferences , , presumably , will depend the role that the Ohio Senator will play in the campaign and , more important , the- , enthusiasm which the Senator 's friends and support ? ers display in urging a Republican victory ; this year .. Senator Frank Carlson of - Kansas , who has been acting as an I agent of the Republican ' nominee in arranging the meeting , rode with the- General yesterday on the light from Washington ' to New Stork .

If the meeting between General Eisenhower and Senator Taft does not take place before Sunday it appears ' likely to be postponed until Sept. 22 , when both will be in Cincinnati , the Senator 's home city . The Senator said yesterday in Washington that he expected to be on hand at that time to g  --  eet the General when he arrived in Cincinnati for a campaign speech . No Recollection of Word At the outset of his informal talk - before Republican campaign workers in Washington yesterday General Eisenhower apologized for uttering an inadvertent ' " damn " during a campaign speech in Indianapolis the night before . He said he had no recollection of using the word , which the radio picked up . but which his listeners in the hall did not hear . Eugene C. Pul-I Ham , publisher of The Indianapolis Star and Indianapolis News , who was on the platform , ascribed the word to a radio technician rather than the General . It - was agreed that it came at a time when the Presidential candidate was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower also report-1 ed that his voice , unaccustomed to extensive public speaking , was beginning to weaken . Reporting on his campaign tour , the Republidan candidate said that while there was no question in his mind that " the . overriding question of our time , from the standpoint . of the human species , is peace , " the people he had met were primarily interested in a change in administrations at Washington . nI believe that it is because of that change they find in their own minds a better progress , a better promise of progress toward peace , toward living within our means , toward elimination of great and useless expenditures , toward . closing the gap in the budget , toward lower prices and lower taxes , toward a restoration of pride in our Government in all echelons , " he added . He and those supporting him are hot trying merely to win an election , he continued . What they want , he said , is " to get this chance to show that during the ' next four years we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward pepce , to-1 ward sanity , toward solvency , ? toward all those things that make an American 's life worth living . " In comparison with the crowds that greeted him in other places ? the number who turned out to see him in Washington yesterday was small . even though he arrived during the lunch hour . At Republican headquarters he received an oversize broom to symbolize his announced crusade to " clean up the mess " in official Washington . There was a liberal supply of other campaign brooms on display . " We 'll call them all into action one of these days , " the General promised .
