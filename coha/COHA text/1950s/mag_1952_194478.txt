Kentucky 's burly Basketball Coach Adolph ( " The Baron " ) Rupp , blistered by Manhattan 's Judge Saul S. Streit in an expose of the evils of professionalized college sport ( TIME , May 12 ) , had another comeuppance last week . The National Collegiate Athletic Association , using Judge Streit 's files , decided that Rupp had another comeuppance last week . The National Collegiate Athletic Association , using Judge Streit 's files , decided that Rupp had 1 ) knowingly used ineligible players , and 2 ) condoned cash payments to his stars . Forthwith the N.C.A.A. cracked down , barred Kentucky 's basketball team from intercollegiate N.C.A.A. play for one year . Kentucky accepted the ban , but had a sassy answer for the N.C.A.A. : a vote of confidence in Rupp , who stays on as Kentucky 's coach .
