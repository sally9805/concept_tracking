By the time Candidate Richard Nixon went back aboard his DC-6 after enduring the 92 heat in Phoenix , Ariz , last week , his face was flushed , his voice hoarse and his temperature up to nearly 100 . His friend and trip physician , Dr. Malcom Todd , made the diagnosis : weakened by a solid month 's worry , strain and work , with only a day and a half of rest , Dick Nixon had a severe case of flu . Todd began dosing Nixon with Achromycin and Mysteclin , spraying his raw throat with cortisone and Pontocaine , urged him to slow down his 15,000-mile swing through the length and breadth of the U.S. More specifically , the doctor begged Nixon to cancel his speech that night in Salt Lake City-but Nixon refused . <P> In Salt Lake City 's Rainbow Randevu dance hall ( serving as a political auditorium for the occasion ) , Nixon gripped the sides of his lectern to keep himself erect . Photographers edged forward , setting their cameras to picture the Vice President at his moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few feet away . But somehow Nixon made it . finishing the speech that he later described as " the toughest of my life . " <P> Over the Hump . Next day Nixon was not only sick , but woozy from the flood of antibiotics . Dr. Todd began shooting him full of vitamins , but Nixon was still able to deliver only 16 minutes of his Oklahoma City speech . Filling in briefly for him after that was his wife and campaign companion , Pat Nixon , who made up in charm what her talk lacked in high-flown political oratory . Said Pat : " We 're very willing to work night and day and to join with you in trying-in our attempt-to elect our great President and in working for the great cause that all of us have . Thank you . " <P> That was by no means the only time that Pat Nixon helped her husband last week : she has developed into a first-rate campaigner .

Sometimes , as along College Street in Springfield , Mo. , she handshakes her way down the opposite side of the street from Dick ; sometimes she chats with ladies ' groups . She also sits in on the late-at-night sessions in which Nixon and his staff review the previous day 's activities and plan for tomorrow . She says little , but what she does say is sound ; e.g. , she insisted that Nixon 's advance men say nothing about the unscheduled handshaking stops for fear the local arrangers might try to set something up that would spoil the spontaneity . <P> Under the Skin . Even as his temperature and his voice returned to normal without the prescribed rest , Nixon continued to show the weeks of hard work . At Springfield , Ill. , he had to turn around to ask Pat what state they had left that morning . In Nashville at 10 a.m. , he asked his audience to " consider with me tonight for just a few days " and said he would like to " talk just a bittle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin : in Wheeling , W.
