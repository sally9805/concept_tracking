txt Senator Robert A. Taft in an aroused mood today assailed what he termed a " Dewey-inspired " propaganda campaign minimizing his chance of carrying New York State should he gain the Republican Presidential nomina1 tion . He gave no indication , however , that he felt the " Dewey " campaign was hurting his chance for the nomination . The Senator also derided the efficacy of . public-opinion polls generally and was particularly critical of the poll conducted by DP : ' George Gallup . Dr. Gallup , he Said ; " has- loaned himself ' to be straight propagandist for Eisenhower . " Senator Taft further declared that should his principal rival , General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , be nominated and conduct'the type of campaign his supPorters " apparently " want ' him to conduct , there was a strong possibility that the ' Republicans might suffer another defeat . Ives ' Ideas the Issue The Senator began his news conference this morning in a relaxed fashion . He became suddenly aroused , however , when a reporter cited a Buffalo newspaper dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , with not wishing to run for reelection if Senator Taft were nominated . The dispatch , written for The Buffalo Evening News by its Albany correspondent , Raymond Borst , did not directly quote Senator Ives but credited him with feeling that should Senator Taft be nominated he would fail to win New York and might carry Senator Ives down with him . Senator Ives , declared Mr. Taft , was not sincere if he made such . a statement . " Senator Ives would run with me as well as he would run with Eisenhower , " Senator Taft asserted . " I could carry New York as well as Eisenhower could carry it . There is no basis for the statement that I could not carry New York . " That report , Senator Taft said , " is being used against me by Dewey . It 's a part of the Dewey // propaganda campaign . " Senator Ives would , not comment on the Buffalo news story . At this point and later in the conference Senator Taft declared that the political organization of Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's campaign . " There is no question so far as political strategy is concerned that Dewey is running the campaign , " Senator Taft said . He cited as Dewey aides who were featuring prominently in the Eisenhower campaign : Herbert Brownell , Governor Dewey 's former campaign manager ; Barak T. Mattingly , a former Republican National Committeeman from Missouri , and William L. Pfeiffer , New York Republican State Chairman . The mention of Governor Dewey launched Senator Taft into his criticism of public opinion polls . He pointed out that the polls had predicted a victory for Mr. Dewey by 5,000,000 in 1948 . His Campaign Formula " I think they 're as unreliable today as they have been in the past , " the Senator declared . The Senator was asked whether the charge of a poll " lending " itself to Eisenhower propaganda concerned only the Gallup Poll . " It 's the only one the people rely on so I do n't think I should branch out , " he replied . Senator Taft said that General Eisenhower 's supporters " apparently " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Dewey conducted unsuccessfully in 1948 . This type of campaign , he indicated , would be unsuccessful again this year . His own formula for a successful campaign , Mr. Taft said , would be based on the campaign he himself waged successfully in 1950 for his Senate seat . This formula , he explained , had two basic points : Present every argument you have against Administration policies both domestic and foreign and organize all the support possible in order to bring in independent voters . The weakness of previous unsuccessful Republican campaigns , Mr. Taft said , was that they tried to enlist the support of " wavering " New Deal and Fair Deal voters instead of trying to bring out the independent voters . Counting of the Delegates Mr. Taft was asked about a statement yesterday by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , campaign manager for General Eisenhower , in which Mr. Lodge said " the jig is up for Senator Taft . " Senator Taft laughingly replied that the statement was " just political talk . " He said there was no justification for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said today that the Senator 's delegate strength as of today was 601 , which is three short of the 604 necessary for nomination . Senator Taft said Saturday that , his strength at that time was " close to 603 or 604 . " Mr. Ingalls issued a tabulation today that gave General Eisenhower 361 delegates , others 129 , and 91 uncommitted . The latest Associated Press tabulation of Republican delegates today gave the roster as follows : Senator Taft , 484 ; General Eisenhower , 407 ; others . 129 ; uncommitted and in dispute , 186 . Mr. Ingalls later in the day said that General Eisenhower " is now going to abandon his Denver mountain fastness and scurry to Chicago to barter for delegates . " " The last vestige of General Eisenhower 's Olympian role of sitting back and waiting for the Republican Presidential nomination to come to him has now gone into the scrap heap . It 's pretty obvious now that the general has discovered that the people are n't seeking him . So in a last frantic effort to salvage his foundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Senator Edwin C. Johnson , Democrat of Colorado and campaig , n manager for Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia , candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination , said today that " it now seems likely " that Senator Russell would be nominated on an early ballot at the Democratic National Convention July 21 . " Senator Russell will make a surprisingly good showing on his first ballot and his total will be larger on his second and each successive ballot . " Senator Johnson said . His prediction , he said , was based on a confidential poll of delegates and on " careful inquiry . " Dewey Is Complimented Governor Dewey said here yesterday that he was highly complimented by Senator Taft 's statement that the Dewey organization was running the campaign of General Eisenhower . The Governor declined to accept credit for the strategy . Dr. Gallup said the accusations of Senator Taft were part of the standard ritual of electioneering . Since the Gallup poll is supported by Republican , Democratic and independent newspapers , by proTaft and by pro-Eisenhower papers , Dr. Gallup said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts .
