 | It is a fine thing for a town to have a fiesta . It is good for everyone to see floats massed with flowers moving down the familiar main street . with the young girls bending and smiling in the light of torches and the men dressed in lovely glittering white like clowns at the Cirque Medrano . It is good to hear loud music in the night air and watch the eyes of children grow dark and large with wonder . It is good for the poor and for the rich , for the same and for different reasons . It is theatrical , in wild contrast to real life . but it is their own fantasy , not the product of a remote place called Hollywood . as the movies are ; and it has smell and texture and breath and heat as well as sight and sound and color . It is free to all who will stand in the crowd along the curbs or hang out of windows to watch ; and with all its pushing and elbowing and jammed traffic and timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many and a bright , dramatic change from the shack on the wrong side of town . For an hour , or a moment , or an evening , it is the best place in the world to be ? better than the schoolroom , the barracks , the cantina , or the cool , formal parlor of the mansion . It is a thing to look forward to , and a thing to talk about for many days afterward . " Did you see Juan dancing with the girl in the yellow skirt ? Who was she ? " " How handsome George looked in his uniform ! " " I thought the float with the many roses was most beautiful , but little Antonia will never forget the one with the ice skaters really skating . " It is a fine thing for people to dance very late , and sing the songs of their fathers , and go home tired , remembering many colors and changing lights and the smiles of girls and sights as elaborate and gaudy as an old-fashioned valentine . San Antonio has a fiesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacinto , and it commemorates the day Texas won its independence from Mexico . But as with so many patriotic celebrations , the battlefield origins have been lost , or at any rate well sublimated. in the peace of later years , so the fiesta is dedicated chiefly to fun and spectacle , and the victory is just a well-venerated excuse written on the page of a history book . Quite accidentally the evening I chose to explore San Antonio 's night life happened to be also the climactic night o. ' the city 's week-long fiesta . Skyscrapertowering as high as thirty-two storieabove the hallowed Alamo were outlined in electric lights , and all along the downtown streets in the gentle dusk people waited for the dark to come . It was Saturday night , the night of the Fiesta Flambeau . Even a stranger could tell that this was a leisurely sunbasking town , quickened for the hour by an excitement that ran from the gilded lobbies of the old hotels to the shiny drugstore doorways where young Mexican women in summer dresses shepherded their solemn little children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ? a terribly important town for America ? taking a night off-to play . And ironically , in its play . San Antonio resembled the nation it defeated more than the nation it joined . The streets crossed by the paraders bore lovely Spanish names , the flavor of the gaiety was inescapably Latin , and all along the line of march more faces were Mexican than Anglo-Saxon . I was feeling  | sentimentally attuned to the fiesta because I had spent the morning and afternoon walking around San Antonio . I had visited the Alamo , where Davy Crockett fell with his coonskin cap beside him . I had strolled through the green parks , and read the inscriptions on the monuments , and watched the winding San Antonio River snake its pictorial way under dozens of little bridges through the busiest parts of town . I had bought a length of ribbon at Joske 's , the bustling big department store ; browsed at outdoor newsstands featuring Negro magazines from the North ; and peered through the windows of short-order restaurants , where men in Nile-green shirts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lunched on chicken salad and avocado in the crystalhung dining room of the century-old Menger Hotel , where Southern ladies , hatted and gloved and artfully rouged , exchanged genteel compliments over the damask napery . I had blinked at the yellowness of the sun , admired the blueness of the sky . A day is enough to make an Easterner yearn to be at least an honorary citizen of Texas . So when nightfall came , I was in a mood for the fiesta . There are two ways to see it : in the ballrooms , where society celebrates with a serious ritual rivaling the pomp of British royalty ; or in the streets and market places and dance halls , where anyone can go . Y GUIDE for the evening was Ed M Castillo , a newspaperman who writes a popular column for the San Antonio Light . I had asked him to show me the places typical of his town after dark , and he steered me first to a place in the business district called Cathay House . This is a private drinking and eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy beverages stronger than wine or beer but do not wish to carry around a bottle of hard liquor in a brown paper bag . Hard liquor is legal in San Antonio , but it must be purchased in licensed liquor stores or drugstores ; it may not be sold over bars or in restaurants or hotel dining rooms . Technically a bartender ? even in a private club ? is forbidden to mix rye or gin with fruit juice or ginger ale or even an olive ; he is supposed to bring the ingredients to the table and let the customer add the alcohol to the trimmings . But in most places this rule is not strictly kept . Connoisseurs have learned the hard way that a cocktail stirred up at the table by loving hands and a cocktail shaken by the pro behind the mahogany are two very different things . People who do not belong to a private club must tote their liquor from place to place , so the bulging pocket is a standard sight in San Antonio , and the wrinkled brown paper bag unmistakably surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no Prohibition atmosphere anywhere in San Antonio . The people can not buy a Scotch and soda in an ordinary restaurant , but if they bring their own Scotch they may order the soda and setups and plunk the Scotch right on the table in full view of the @#  | very best people . There is no sneaking it out of the pocket and no hiding the bottle under the table after the drink is poured . The system is inconvenient , but it is not furtive . In the private precincts of Cathay House things were simpler . Lockers in the rear of the dim , air-conditioned , expensively furnished room were filledlegally ? with the favorite brands of the members , and their favorite brands seemed to encompass everything essential to the well-rounded cocktail hour . BECAUSE fiesta excitement was keeping most people out in the streets or parked at windows overlooking the parade route , there were not many people in the club when we arrived . C. B. Fulton , a wealthy gentleman in the refining business , was enjoying a drink in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he owns thirteen pairs of suede shoes ? was flicking imaginary dust off his immaculate domain ; and a local newspaperman named Renwicke Cary , who writes a column called " Around the Plaza , " was buying a cocktail for Marge Cannon , a buyer for Frost Brothers ' department store . Mr. Castillo and I joined Mr. Cary and Miss Cannon at their table . In the exotic Oriental atmosphere of the Cathay , with yellow lanterns overhead and orchid-colored latticework shadowing the red silk walls , Mr. Cary explained that he wrote a rather homespun column because the people of San Antonio were small-townish at heart . " If a cow got out of a pen , they 'd like to read about it in the paper , " he said . " Somebody breaking a leg , or somebody going to the hospital ? that interests them more than a lot of big front-page news . " Miss Cannon , who wore a largebrimmed hat and was pink-cheeked and charming in the best traditions of Southern femininity , attempted to analyze the mores involving ladies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably just recently , but that the unwritten rules governing female drinking had been ? and in some ways still were ? pretty old-fashioned . " Just three years ago , " Miss Cannon said , " if a lady walked into a downtown tavern , she was n't considered a lady . Now girls do go in twos and threes to the cocktail lounges for a drink after office hours , but believe me , they 're looked at . " A large shadow fell over our table , and the proprietor of Cathay House , John C. Hamilton , greeted us with a big jovial voice and a giant handshake . If he had been invented on the spot , he could not have been more the Hollywood scriptwriter 's version of a Texan . He was handsome , with powerful muscles that rippled against the sleeves of his lighttan suit , and he was polite and amiable , and he referred to his state as " Tayxuhs . " People call him Big John because he is six feet four inches tall in ordinary shoes , six-eight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the six-eight because he was dressed in Western style to march in the torchlight parade . Before he left to join the marchers he showed me around the club , pausing longest at the bar where there was centered , behind Tucker , a gilded Oriental idol with eight arms . Mr. Hamilton said the decorator who designed Cathay House had spent two weeks in San Francisco gathering imported items for its embellishment and had come back with ,  | among other accessories , the idol . He could n't say what it was called , but he remembered with a slight wince that it had cost $1,800 . He said the club catered to business executives mostly , and some oilmen ( " all " men was the way he said it ) , and merchants and ranchers . " Ah reckon Ah 've got fifty millionaires in this club right now , " he said , " including the fifth richest man in Tayx-uhs . " We all watched him with ungrudging admiration as he put on his big creamcolored sombrero and strode out of the club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward . We dropped in at the Insurance Club ? a modern , luxurious setup with a membership composed entirely of insurance men ? then progressed to a public rendezvous , the Tiffany Bar and Lounge on Houston Street . Where the Insurance Club had upholstered divans , and Toulouse-Lautrec posters framed on the walls , and women in silk dresses and flowered hats , the Tiffany had a long utilitarian bar lit with pink neon , and a juke box playing " April in Portugal , " and many young men in blue jeans and sport shirts and cowboy hats and uniforms , but hardly any women , and none in silk dresses . THE Tiffany is what San Antonio has come to call a " cocktail lounge , " but cocktails are not served . It is a perfectly public , perfectly law-abiding place where you can buy beer or wine but nothing stronger . At the tables that filled the center of the room , and in the booths along the wall opposite the bar , young men in and out of uniform sat three and four together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even smiling much . Many of them drank beer , but some had whisky bottles on the table ? brought in from the drugstore ? and were mixing whisky with Coke or 7-Up or soda supplied by the waitresses . There were only four girls in the whole crowded place . As we sat watching the scene , a tall , big-shouldered blond young man came over to our booth to ask what I was doing in Texas . I told him . He was Herb Howell , a Californian presently stationed in San Antonio at one of the Air Force bases , where he was an airplane mechanic , and he was full of energy and jive talk . He dug Dave Brubeck and Paul Quinichette and Lee Konitz and all the special ones , and when he discovered I did too , he filled me in on the best numbers in the juke box and seemed overjoyed to find a kindred soul . " Man ! " he said to Mr. Castillo . " I did n't know she was cool ! " He said he would be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bubber Bright 's Quintet , and he urged us to come around and dig it too . We said we would , after the parade was over . Our next stop was the Paradise Lounge ? another " cocktail " haven without cocktails ? so dim you could hardly see the Marilyn Monroe calendar picture behind the bar . It was more luxurious than the Tiffany , with elaborate murals featuring birds of paradise , and a curly-haired young man named Jimmy Reagan playing " Vows Qui Passez " on a piano perched on an elevated stage at one end of the room , and a giant mirror reflecting Jimmy and his pale satin tie . The Paradise caters to substantial business people , oil-company officials , and professional men , and it is operated by  | Philip Sfair , one of an interesting quartet of brothers who all run restaurants or night clubs and ride in light-blue or cream-colored Cadillacs . When we left the Paradise , it was dark and the torchlight parade had started . A band was playing , and a corps of drum majorettes were stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink and white and cloth of gold and purple glitter crawled slowly along the street . We watched for a while , then took a taxi to El Charro on Fredericksburg Road , which Mr. Castillo considers the best Mexican restaurant in the nonMexican part of town . Certainly it was vivid and gay . The walls and tables and chairs were splashed with primary colors ; the waitresses were dressed in the bright striped costumes of Michoacan , with winged shoulders and theatrically designed coifs . The chairs we sat on came from Toluca , the silver masks on the walls from Guadalajara . We ate a dinner calculated to make the most rugged pancreas scream for mercy , starting with nachos made of tostados , cheese , and jalapeno peppers and proceeding without pause through chickeri tacos , enchiladas , beans , chili , tamales , rice tortillas , a salad , and Mexican candy . All this , including coffee , came to $1.50 per person , and I must say I enjoyed every fiery morsel of it . Less adventurous types might have ordered a T-bone steak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied by a large plate of enchiladas with chile con carne for only 75c . All the prices for the Mexican food were remarkably low ; the menu even included a child 's plate consisting of a tamale , beans , rice , tortillas , and milk for just 40c . True to our promise to Herb Howell , we went on to the Club San Antonio . It one flight up over Houston ? the main street ? and the stairs you climb to get to It are covered with mouse-colored carpeting polka-dotted with the holes uurned by many cigarettes . Inside it was dim and lively and crowded with young people . Bubber Bright , who turned out to be a tenor-sax man , was leading his zroup in " I'se A-Muggin ' , " and an impressive collection of couples were on t : . e dance floor doing brilliant versions o ; the Lindy ? cool , underplaying it , respectful of the other experts , and not exhibitionistic but terribly intense . Clearly tuts was a place for serious dancing . Most of the young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downtown offices and department gores . As in most of the places I visited in San Antonio , the girls were far outnumbered by the men ? probably because of the city 's many military installations . Herb was there , dancing with a beautiful Mexican girl , and both of them were almost professional in their precision and grace . It was fun to watch them . ACROSS the river , in the section of the city referred to as the West Side , live the Mexicans and citizens of Mexican extraction who comprise 40.1 per cent of San Antonio 's population . Here , on streets named Laredo and 1VIonterey , are the houses of the poor , and ramsnackle stores , and cantinas with a bar and a juke box and dark-haired waitresses who also dance with the men who come in to buy a beer on Saturday night . Here walk proud people whose families have been in Texas since it was part of Mexico , and others who crossed the border  | illegally to be used as cheap labor and have managed to stay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . Here they have strolling musicians , the romantic mariachis , and here in the cantinas every now and then , the quick flash of a fila and sudden death . All was sedate in the night club Mr. Castillo and I visited ? the Taxco , on Medina Street . Arnulfo Garcia and his band were playing a wonderful mambo , and girls in cowboy pants with fringe or wide bright-colored skirts danced smoothly on the tile floor with wavy-haired young men . Some of the tables had beer bottles on them ; others , bottles of hard liquor ? brought in , of course , by the customers . As you enter the Taxco you notice , on a ceiling beam just opposite the door , the crudely lettered words " Couples " ( with an arrow pointing to the left ) and " Stags " ( with an arrow pointing to the right ) . A young man connected with the club explained this . He said it meant that couples coming in , or foursomes , were made to sit on the left side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come alone and boys who had come stag or in groups . On the right side of the room kindred spirits could join or not , but the segregation was aimed at keeping flirtatious fellows and girls from breaking up established combinations and possibly starting a riot . WE LEFT as a trio of male singers wearing milk-white suits with boleros came out to play and sing . They sounded great , but it was time to go to the biggest event on the West Side this fiesta night ? the dance at the farmers ' market . La Marketa , the Mexicans call it . It is a giant stone-floored enclosure like a pier . Usually it is a place where vegetables are sold , but this night it had been cleared of its stalls and gaily draped with flags and bunting . Folding chairs had been placed in an immense oval , broken only by a bandstand , and the space under the gray metal roof reverberated to the rhythms of Lupito Viero and his orquesta . It was a knockout orquesta too . Men and women and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were lovers with their arms around each other , and young married women holding tiny babies wrapped in blankets , and elderly women smiling at the dancers , and old men dozing a little as they sat there . Some of the children ran around the chairs and played ; others slept . It was midnight . It cost 25 ? ' to get in to this scene of gaiety and color . We all wore little tabs of red or green satin ribbon stapled to our collars , which meant we had paid and were part of the festivity . This was the best part of the evening . People were not in costume , except for a few boys in the scarlet uniform of some band that had paraded , but they looked dramatic just the same . It was a combination of the planes of their faces , sensitive and exotic , and their luminous black eyes , and the clothing they were not afraid to wear ? the vivid-pink and turquoise and light-green shirts of the men , and the colored skirts and gold bracelets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all fairs and festivals . They flirted . They yawned . At a refreshment stand decorated with crepe-paper streamers they ate the enchiladas and tortillas of Mexico , washed down with the soda pop of the U.S.A.  | Some of the men danced with their hats on . Some of the children could not take their eyes from the dancing , and it aid have a hypnotic effect after a while because there were so many feet to . watch , all sliding in the same rhythm . One little girl about five stood watching over a smaller boy who was sleeping curled up on two chairs between the grownups . She was blond and extraordinarily lovely , maternal and grave . At one point , when the music of a paso doble grew very loud , she put her hands over the little boy 's ears so the sound would not waken him . I shall not forget La Marketa . THE fiesta had many other things too . Artie Shaw was playing at the Club Sevenoaks , a big ranch-type dance hall on the Austin Highway ; a Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce the crewcut toupee ) was making the customers laugh in the elegant supper room of the St. Anthony Hotel ; at the Menger , the Coronation Ball was in progress , and the in-Town Court and the Out-of-Town Court were paying homage to Her Gracious Majesty , Annalyn of the House of Achning. who had been crowned Queen of the Court of Opera on Thursday of fiesta week . When they say " society " in San Anyonio , they are not kidding . The solemnity and lavishness with which the upper crust approach the matter of the debutante and her clan is at first unbelievable , then staggering . It took almost an hour 's briefing by a lady who was up to her chin in society to convince me that when I saw in the local newspaper items reading " Introduced as the Queen 's Maid of Honor was Tatty Witherspoon Lewis , Princess of Lyrical Inspiration " and " Members of the Out-ofTown Court included Lady Margaret of the House of Calhoun , Spirit of Oriental Charm , " I was not reading a special fiesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally F. Bourn , general manager of the hotel where the Coronation Ball is held , assured me that this has been going on for years , and that some queens , in the past , have been known to spend as much as $20,000 for their coronation dresses . The Witte Memorial Museum has received some of the gowns ? epic affairs of satin , embroidery , beading , and lace ? as donations . The presence of Fort Sam Houston , Kelly Air Force Base , Lackland Air Force Base , and Randolph Air Force Base gives San Antonio another social stratum with considerable formality ? the life on the protocol-conscious officer level of the swank Army and Navy clubs . San Antonio has mild weather , and tropical trees , and a zoo with bears , and neon signs everywhere . Its frankfurter stands sell " devil dogs " ( frankfurters cooked by infrared rays ) , and its taxis clock 35 ? on the meter the minute you get in . String quartets grouped around ornate Louis XIV pianos play Romberg in the hotel lobbies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sunken Gardens in Brackenridge Park . It is an interesting city , full of sun and life . But when I think of San Antonio I shall think first of the fiesta , remembering La Marketa , and the swirling skirts , and the sleepy children , and how gay it was .
