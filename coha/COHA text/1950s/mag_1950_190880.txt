Because of Colombia 's rigid internal censorship , Bogota 's famed Liberal daily , El Tiempo , keeps a guarded silence about political developments at home . But when considering the affairs of her hemisphere neighbors , El Tiempo aims and fires at will . Last week El Tiempo drew a bead on Argentina 's President Juan Domingo Pern , whose followers recently celebrated Loyalty Day ( TIME , Oct. 30 ) , known also to thousands of Argentines as " Saint Pern 's Day . " Said El Tiempo : <P> " Saint Pern 's Day signifies that popular rapture has reached a heavenly level . It is not enough to call Pern a Caudillo , Big Brother , Duce or Fhrer ; these terms have a worldly connotation , and since he has achieved heavenly status without the necessity of dying , it is better to dub him saint . But in another sense , Saint-Peron-ism is the political version of Superman . Even as the followers of Superman trust in his extraordinary talents , so do the shirtless worshipers of Saint Pern believe in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explained El Tiempo with a sly dig at Colombian President Laureano Gmez , " all this has nothing to do with us here in Colombia . But this kind of hagiolatry might spread the length and breadth of the continent with the appearance of further saints of this type . Perhaps the canonization of Saint Odra of Peru and Saint Trujillo of the Dominican Republic already is in the works . When the day comes that there are five or seven heavenly governments in this hemisphere , it will be the last bell for democracy . "
