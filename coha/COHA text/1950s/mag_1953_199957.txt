The wedding , carried off in lavish , old-style pageantry in spite of rain , drew a glittering collection of guests : three kings , three queens , a grand duchess , an archduke , 22 princes , 18 princesses , and assorted lesser nobility . Royal feathers were momentarily ruffled when Princess de Rethy , commoner wife of Belgium 's abdicated King Leopold III ( father of the bride ) , got uncommonly close to the head of the procession . But a good time seemed to be had by the 100,000 soggy Luxembourgers and tourists who goggled , cheered and shot off skyrockets . <P> <P> Married .
