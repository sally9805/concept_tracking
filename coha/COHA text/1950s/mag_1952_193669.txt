Walkie-lookie . Chairman David Sarnoff revealed one of RCA 's latest steps in television : a portable " walkie-lookie " camera , transmitter and receiver , which Sarnoff believes will be ready for use at this summer 's political conventions . Using pencil-size tubes and miniature components , the 53-lb. walkie-lookie carries its own battery in a pack strapped to the operator 's back , can relay images to re-transmitters as far distant as one mile . <P> Green Thumbs . Monsanto , which had not expected to be able to market its new soil-conditioner " Krilium " ( TIME , Jan. 7 , 1952 ) until 1953 , announced that it had been able to increase production enough to offer it this year , in 5-lb. packages priced at $6.95 . One box will condition 80 sq . ft. of new lawn to a depth of 3 in. , keep the soil porous and crumbly for as long as three years . Another reason for Monsanto 's hurry : competitors were beginning to raid its market . <P> Self-Service Beauty . Manhattan working girls can now freshen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , before going on a date . For $1 a year , 25 a visit and dimes in slot machines , a tired secretary can take a shower , wash and curl her hair , manicure her nails , look at television . <P> Dry Battery . Firestone Tire &; Rubber Co. introduced a new " dry " - type storage battery which is guaranteed to last three months longer than ordinary batteries . Its acid is not added to the battery until it is sold , unlike the conventional battery , whose acid is put in at the factory , resulting in a steady discharge of cells before the customer begins to use it . Price : about $1.50 more than other batteries .
