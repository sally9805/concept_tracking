txt TRENTON , March ** name of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio will remain on the ballot in the Republican Presidential preference ! primary to be held April 15 despite the Senator 's attempted withdrawal . Judge Ralph J. Smalley of Superior Court so ruled today , and Theodore Parsons , Attorney Gen'eral , representing Lloyd B. Marsh , Secretary of State , said he would not appeal . Mr. Parsons ceased pressing the case when Taft supporters let it be known they objected to the legal move to get the ( Ohioan off the ballot . The court ruling appeared to some political observers to leave the Taft group exactly where they wanted to be in New Jersey ? in the race , but with nothing to lose if they failed to make a showing . Senator Taft announced last Thursday  --  eight days after the final date for withdrawal under ( the New Jersey primary law  --  that he was foregoing participation in the state 's " popularity contest " because Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll had endorsed General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pledge of neutrality by the // Governor . The Driscoll supporters declared the Senator sought to quit the contest because of the successful showings made by General Eisenhower in the New Hampshire and Minnesota primaries . Secretary of State Marsh instructed Senator Taft to file a formal withdrawal in writing and the Senator did so . Mr. Marsh then applied to the court to have Mr. Taft 's name removed from the ballot in all of New Jersey 's twentyone counties . Some of the counties already had printed ballots bearing the name of Senator Taft as well as those of the other entrants , General Eisenhower and Harold E. Stassen , former Minnesota Governor . Mr. Marsh 's court action , preseated by Attorney General Parsons , was opposed today by six Republican voters , believed to be proTaft , and one county clerk , Alexander Allan of Bergen , where the lorganization has declined to join the Driscoll drive for General Eisenhower . Mr. Allan asserted that sample ballots , costing $10,000. would have to be reprinted if Mr. Taft 's name were removed . Judge Smalley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " In view of the overriding public interest and in view of the telegrams I have received from county clerks , I feel now that the sentiment of the public is for Taft 's name to remain on the ballot . The case will be dismissed and there will be no restraint . " He said that Mr. Marsh had been justified in seeking the injunction order . Senator Taft , campaigning in Wisconsin , declined to comment on the developments . He said : " It 's too far away and I do n't know all the circumstances . " Governor Driscoll , discussing the situation at a news conference , said : " As you know , we have all consistently hoped that as many candidates as possible would appear on the ballot to give our citizens the opportunity to express their I preference . " One of the candidates you can identify stated he had withdrawn from the New Jersey race , whereupon the Secretary of State sought to comply with his request that his name be withdrawn .

" Soon after the court ruling , the New Jersey Eisenhower Steering ' Committee announced plans for a stepped-up campaign to " obtain the largest possible vote for General Eisenhower in the preferential primary . " The committee said it " welcomed " continuation of Senator Taft 's name on the ballot to permit " the widest expression of popular opinion . " The committee said it hoped " Senator Taft will now find it possible to campaign actively in New Jersey as he planned originally . " Plans of the Eisenhower committee to open headquarters at 155 Washington Street in Newark at 3 P. M. tomorrow were announced The offices will supplement the Trenton headquarters in the orig .. inal offices of the Republicans for Eisenhower Club . A women 's division of the Eisenhower Committee also will be formed , headed by Mrs. Stewart Alexander of Park Ridge , co-chairman with Senator Malcolm Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , who had been Mr. Taft 's New Jersey campaign manager , announced that he did not plan to reactivate the Senator 's state headquarters , closed last week . The Ohioan 's aide added , however , that " I plan to do work on my own for the Senator and I think a lot of other people are going to do the same . " This was corroborated by Carl E. Ring , a strong Taft supporter , who is running for the nomination as United States Senator against H. Alexander Smith , the incumbent . Mr. Ring , informed of the court action , said : " I am not at all surprised that the court had upheld the law as written , not as interpreted by Secretary Lloyd Marsh . I am of the opinion that Taft will get a bigger vote now than he would have before . " Earlier in the day , Mr. Ring had issued a statement declaring he had evidence of a " plot " to nominate Governor Driscoll for Vice President on an Eisenhower ticket , and that this accounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 lines
