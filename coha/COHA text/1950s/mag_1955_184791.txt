BAND OF ANGELS ( 375 pp. ) - Robert Penn Warren-Random House ( $3.95 ) . <P> Amantha ( " Manty " ) Starr is one of those field marshals of amour to whom every man is a potential casualty . The literary company she keeps is Amber and Scarlett O'Hara , and it is somewhat surprising company for Pulitzer-Prizewinning Novelist ( All the King 's Men ) and Poet Robert Penn Warren . In this magnolia-scented potboiler of the Civil War era , he has little to offer his readers but blood , sex , sweat and crocodile tears . <P> Amantha grows up in pre-Civil War peace and plenty at Starrwood , a Kentucky plantation where the happy field hands gather round to serenade her burly father with such ditties as : <P> Ride Ole Massa <P> Ride him high , <P> If he give me the whisky , I be drunk <P> till I die ! <P> Amantha goes off to a strait-laced school in Ohio and raises the temperature of one Bible-thumping fellow student to such a degree that he throws himself in a snowbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a shock that lasts a lifetime . The sheriff hands Starrwood over to creditors for bad debts and tells her that she is the daughter of one of her father 's Negro concubines . She is soon auctioned off in the New Orleans slave market . As a brash young dandy moves forward to finger the merchandise , he tangles with Hamish Bond , a jut-jawed local power , who breaks the dandy 's wrist with one swipe of his silver-knobbed cane , and buys Manty . <P> Hamish is broody , aging , and he limps , but one stormy , skirt-ripping night , he takes uncontested ownership of his new property . Into their May-December idyl steps a French cad with a gold-headed cane , Charles de Marigny Prieur-Denis . Then the Civil War comes ( " Yes sir , Hamish , a battle going on at Harper 's Ferry " ) , and with the war Manty 's freedom and an honest-to-goodness husband , Tobias Sears , a Massachusetts Yankee . On their wedding night he approaches her " like the statue of a Greek athlete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white marble . " Manty is not quite strong and true enough to tell him of her Negro blood and that is fodder for another 150 pages of on-again , off-again moral tussle . At odd moments . Author Warren has his heroine burn with a lofty love for freedom , which Manty , a girl with ants in her semantics , easily confuses with the freedom to love .
