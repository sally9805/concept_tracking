In 1872 Russian Composer Modest Mussorgsky began putting together a notebook entitled " Khovanchina ; a People 's Musical Drama-Materials . " It was the biggest project of his career : a historical opera dealing with the abortive revolt of the feudal Princes Khovansky and their followers ( Khovanchina ) against the Westernizing influences of Peter the Great 's court . <P> Mussorgsky 's notebook did not fatten very quickly . Poverty , a growing fondness for vodka , other musical chores , and the necessity of supporting himself by work as a government office drudge kept distracting him . When he died in 1881 at the age of 42 there were still some patches of the opera left undone . His friend Rimsky-Korsakov finished the work , and the opera had its official premiere in St. Petersburg in 1911 , began to get scattered performances outside of Russia . <P> Last week the golden curtain at Man hattan 's Metropolitan Opera House went up on Khovanchina for the first time . As the gloomy drama rolled along , at the lumbering pace of a sullen rhinoceros , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put off by the arthritic English libretto . But gradually the glowing music , which had been expertly edited by able Conductor Emil Cooper , put them in a good mood . <P> " I want to do people , " Mussorgsky wrote a friend- " big , without any paint or tinsel . " Among the paint &; tinsel he avoided were the fripperies of Italian and French opera with their wooden recitatives and stagy arias , and the prettied-up harmonies of such fellow Russians as Tchaikovsky . In Khovanchina , Mussorgsky came very close to his ideal of realistic singing speech . <P> Prince Ivan Khovansky , whose part Met Veteran Lawrence Tibbett acted better than he sang , took his music as well as his politics from the old Russia . His contingent of astrakhan-capped soldiers and gaily clad peasant followers carried him along on a swelling surge of music flavored by the Russian folk songs which Nationalist Mussorgsky loved so dearly . Mussorgsky mined the rich vein of Russian liturgical themes to back up the somber , icon-bearing Old Believers . Led by the young zealot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jerome Hines ) , they sang the opera 's most exciting music . <P> When the final curtain fell , with Ivan Khovansky murdered and his son Prince Andrei , zealot Marfa and the entire sect of Old Believers singing a resounding funeral dirge around a pyre they had built for themselves , first-nighters were still shaky on plot details . But critics and audience were agreed that they had been introduced to three hours of blood-Warm music which , with familiarity , might become as well liked as Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov .
