In the open waters of the Northern Pacific seas , the huge salmon were beginning an instinctive journey westward toward their spawning grounds in the rushing rivers of Kamchatka , Sakhalin and Siberia 's eastern shores . Always before they had been met by thousands of Japanese fishing boats , which plucked almost all of Japan 's important salmon catch from the northern waters . But this year the salmon move unmolested , and the sea is free of boats . Back in the fishing villages of Hokkaido , the Japanese vessels wait idly , their crews staring balefully out to sea . The gay festival that was to precede the departure for the fishing grounds has been canceled . <P> Five weeks ago , angered at the Japanese for breaking off peace treaty talks in London , the U.S.S.R. imposed severe controls on Japanese salmon fishing in the Okhotsk Sea , the western Bering Sea and parts of the North Pacific ( see map ) during the four-month spawning season . The prohibition put a merciless squeeze on Japan 's fishing industry , which provides Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Pacific at will , but Japan now finds herself hemmed in by restricted areas . <P> In the Sea of Japan ( rich in sardine , mackerel and flatfishes ) , an arbitrary " Rhee line " imposed by Japanese-hating Syngman Rhee keeps Japanese fishermen at least 60 miles away from the Korean coast . Southwest in the East China Sea , the Far East 's best trawling grounds , the Japanese may not come within 100 miles of the Communist China coast . The coastal waters of North America , once a plentiful source of salmon and halibut , are now closed to Japan by a U.S. Canadian agreement that occupied Japan was persuaded to sign . And in the vast mid-Pacific tuna and bonito grounds , the U.S. has posted a 421,500-sq. - mi. nuclear testing area , which jittery Japanese fishermen have given a wide berth since radioactive ash fell on the Fortunate Dragon . <P> The Russians have been waging an unofficial fishing war against Japan since World War II , seizing hundreds of ships and imprisoning 3,796 men . This week a 17-man Japanese delegation led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in Moscow to try to get the Russians to lift their latest restriction . Confidently Kono talked of a settlement in ten days . But unless he is prepared to make major political concessions , the hard-bargaining Russians are apt to drag out negotiations until the salmon are safely in their rivers and hundreds of Japanese fishermen are ruined .
