New Mexico 's Patrick Jay Hurley , onetime ( 1902-07 ) Indian-fighting cavalryman and much later U.S. Secretary of War ( under Herbert Hoover ) , is a man who can lose battles and still keep on trying to win the war . Three times ( 1946 , 1948 , 1952 ) he has tried to win a seat in the U.S. Senate , and each time he has failed . Last year , after Democratic Senator Dennis Chavez defeated him by only 5,375 votes , Republican Hurley cried fraud , contested the election , got the U.S. Senate to order an investigation . Last week , more than 13 months after the balloting , Pat Hurley still had a chance , albeit a slim one . <P> In Washington , the Senate subcommittee that has been investigating the election issued a preliminary report . By a 2-1 vote , it recommended that 30,000 ballots be declared void . Wyoming 's Republican Senator Frank Barrett , subcommittee chairman , and Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter agreed that the secrecy of the ballot had been " flagrantly violated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as required by New Mexico law . Dissenting , Missouri Democrat Thomas C. Hennings argued that the violation of law was a technical one that had long been accepted in New Mexico , and does not constitute fraud . <P> If the 30,000 ballots were thrown out , Hurley would have about 5,000 more votes than Chavez . The subcommittee 's vote is by no means a final action . Chairman Barrett said that he plans further investigation , may not file a formal report for another six weeks . Then , the recommendation will go to the Senate Rules Committee , which will report to the Senate . Unless Iraud is clearly shown , a majority of Senators almost certainly will stand by Colleague Chavez . On one other point , however , there was even greater certainty : having won a skirmish , old ( 70 ) Cavalryman Hurley is sure to dig in his spurs and ride harder than ever .
