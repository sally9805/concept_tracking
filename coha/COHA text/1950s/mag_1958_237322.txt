COCKTAIL TIME ( 2 1 9 pp. ) - P. G. Wodehouse-Simon &; Schusfer ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Pelham Grenville Wodehouse is by now a part of the Anglo-U.S. climate . Scatty , erratic , now on now off the beam , Wodehouse has nonetheless pulled off the astonishing feat of making his creations a living part of the civilized world . Even the many who can not stomach him have no option but to respond to the mere word Jeeves with a mental picture of a whole society ; while to those who lap him up , a whole corner of mental life is occupied by such characters as Lord Emsworth , Lord ( " Uncle Fred " ) Ickenham , Bertie Wooster , Mr. Mulliner , Psmith and that great Sheba of sows , " Empress of Blandings . " <P> Cocktail Time ( " A Novel about a Novel " ) , the latest of Wodehouse 's 76 books , shares with its predecessors the Wodehousian characteristic of being strictly up to date in time and half a century behind in taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Aldridge calls ' ' the miraculous capacity of the human body to operate without the assistance of any mental powers whatever . " Among the 15-odd starters : <P> Frederick Altamount Cornwallis Twistleton , fifth Earl of Ickenham , who shoots off the top hat of a London barrister by means of a slingshot loaded with a Brazil nut-thus confirming his title as " England 's answer to Annie Oakley . " <P> Pongo Twistleton , Uncle Fred 's nephew , who goes all " white and shaken , like a dry martini " on seeing the punctured topper fly through the air . <P> Barrister Sir Raymond Bastable , owner of the hat and an " overbearing dishpot , " who assumes that the David behind the slingshot is a youthful delinquent , and is inspired to write ( anonymously ) a bitter exposure of British youth in the form of a novel named Cocktail Time . <P> The Bishop of Stortford , who denounces Cocktail Time ( " obscene , immoral , shocking , impure , corrupt , shameless , graceless and depraved " ) from the pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the sacred edifice you could see eager men jotting the name down on their shirt cuffs . . . " <P> Albert Peasemarch , butler to Sir Raymond , who has " about as much brain as you could comfortably put in an aspirin bottle , " but whose skill in giving her cocker spaniel an emetic awakens the love of Sir Raymond 's sister Phoebe . <P> Cocktail Time shows that though now ( to use his own words ) " a spavined septuagenarian , " P. G. Wodehouse still has more to offer than most unspavined zanies of younger generations . <P> A longtime expatriate , Wodehouse ( pronounced Woodhouse ) has not lived permanently in England since 1929 . Captured by the Nazis in 1940 in his villa in Le Touquet near Boulogne , Wodehouse was soon released from prison camp , sat out the war in comfortable hotels in Berlin and Paris , made several broadcasts over the Nazi radio that created a storm of criticism in Britain . Though later cleared ( dithered Wodehouse later : " A terrible mistake . I intended them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio to get messages back home " ) , Wodehouse chose not to return to Britain , came to the U.S. in 1947.
