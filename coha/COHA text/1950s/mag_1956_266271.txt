When Colorado-born Jean Paul Mather became president of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst two years ago at 39 , he knew that he had a problem campus on his hands . Founded in 1863 as the Massachusetts Agricultural College , the university did not achieve university status until 1947 . It had grown from an uninspiring prewar institution with four small divisions , 1,260 students and 45 buildings to one with 75 buildings , an enrollment of 4,300 , schools of agriculture , engineering , nursing , home economics and business administration . But academically , says President Mather , today the University of Massachusetts is doomed to " increasing mediocrity . " Reason : it has almost completely lost the power to control the caliber and size of its own faculty . <P> More Zombies . Since 1954 the university has been struggling inside a strange sort of straitjacket . In an effort to streamline the administration of various commonwealth agencies , the legislature placed them all-including the university-under the thumb of the Division of Personnel and Standardization . The division classifies jobs , sets salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It applies the same procedures to the university as it does to mental hospitals , prisons and road-building projects . The result is that Massachusetts can not begin to compete with other campuses for top teachers . " What can I get ? " asks President Mather . " Intellectual zombies . " <P> In hiring a full professor , Mather can offer him no more than $6,180 . At the end of twelve years , the professor automatically reaches a final salary of $7,680 , but the Division of Personnel and Standardization bars merit raises . When the professor dies , the division is apt to downgrade his post to an associate professorship , thus making proper replacement even more difficult than it would be normally . " If the librarian requires top-level professional assistants , " says Mather , " he will be told by the division that he can not have them because the mental hospitals do not have assistants in their libraries . When a professorship becomes vacant in the history department , and we want to use the money for that professorship to improve the geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not approve . And usually it does n't . " <P> Rotted Crop . In 1950 the division made a six-week survey of the university , promptly " nagged " ( i.e. , marked for elimination or downgrading ) one out of ten university posts . In spite of the campus ' growth , the division still stands by that 1950 report . Once , when Mather appealed for extra hands to help with the school of agriculture 's bumper crop , the division said no . The crop rotted , and at considerable expense the university had to buy its food on the open market . All in all , the setup has been so suffocating that the Phi Beta Kappa senate has refused to charter a university chapter .
