A millionaire hired an Episcopal priest last week to help him give away his money with charity and prudence . <P> This new kind of pastorate might never have come into being if , one day in 1948 , the organ in a small Minnesota country church had not broken down . Deacon Alan Humrickhouse of Royalton , Minn , ( pop : 500 ) went looking for an electrician . He found Vernon Pick at nearby Two Rivers . Talking over the repair job at Pick 's house , he was surprised to find the electrician had a library that would do justice to a college professor . Pick was equally surprised to hear the way the deacon talked electric motors ( he had been installing communications equipment for the Bell Telephone Co. before he joined the church ) . Almost at once the two men fell to settling the affairs of the world . They are still at it . <P> Three years after their first talk , Electrician Pick went out looking for uranium . After months of hardship , he struck it rich near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first uranium millionaires ( so far , Pick 's Delta Mine has made him about $10 million-TIME , Sept. 6 ) . Before long , like many another really rich man , Pick found that the world 's less fortunate swarmed toward him at the news of his success ; his mail was stacked high with requests for everything from medical aid to a sports car for use in uranium prospecting . He set up a philanthropic organization called the Pick Foundation to handle his grants-many of them to graduate students in the humanities-for he is concerned that the U.S. is so much longer on technology than on culture . Last week Millionaire Pick announced that his old friend , the Rev. Alan Humrickhouse , 43 , would take over the job of running the foundation . With the blessing of Minnesota 's Episcopal Bishop Stephen E. Keeler , he will leave his rectorship of St. Matthew 's Episcopal Church in St. Paul and move out to Grand Junction , though he will stay on the rolls of the Minnesota clergy . His title : Assistant to the President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is not often that one 's wild dreams are fulfilled . Idealistically , it is my earnest hope that I can be useful in helping to build a firm foundation for the peaceful use of atomic power . "
