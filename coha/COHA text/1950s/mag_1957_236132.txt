THE EXECUTIVE WIFE <P> IN the current folklore of U.S. business the wife of an executive is often represented as being equally important to her husband 's career as his own abilities . Some U.S. corporations have taken to interviewing wives before hiring or promoting executives , others regularly appraise executive wives by visits to the home or at corporate parties . A few even provide seminars and conferences for wives in an attempt to fashion the ideal executive helpmate . All this has prompted a string of articles , fiction and movies depicting the ideal " Mrs. Executive " -a woman who furthers her husband 's career by molding herself into the pattern of corporate living , helping to achieve success by an endless round of professional sociability . <P> - <P> This week the Chicago management-engineering firm of John A. Patton Inc. released a survey of 4,000 wives of the nation 's top executives-the women who are supposed to set the pattern . The results offer some hard facts to challenge the proposition that executive wives must also marry the corporation . Sixty percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from corporate contacts , attend only necessary social functions , such as conventions ; even the 40% who disagreed recommended only " a middle ground " of sociability . Said Mrs. Margaret Barry , wife of a vice president of the Michigan Bell Telephone Co. : " It seems wiser to have one 's best friends outside the company . " Many of the wives reported that they had seen careers hampered rather than helped by overly chummy wives as well as by those who drank or talked too much . <P> While more than half the women felt that the executive wife could well undergo some company appraisal , most drew the line at anything so crass as an interview , favored more informal methods , e.g. , dropping in at home . The dissent ( 45% ) to even this moderate approach was surprisingly vehement . Said Mrs. Elizabeth Harvey , wife of the director of industrial relations for General Electric 's Automotive Division : " This recent development is abhorrent to any sensible woman who desires to be a homemaker as opposed to a business appendage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women-to the much-publicized concept of a " corporate wife . " The men who hire or promote executives are still far more interested in the husband 's abilities than in the wife 's worth . Said an Atlanta executive : " We need good men so bad they could be married to almost anyone and we 'd grab ' em . Of course , we 'd prefer that she not use a toothpick , but beyond that she 's his problem , not ours . " Most corporations hope for some social relationships among executives , but do not try to forge them by selecting wives to fit into a pattern . " I doubt very much , " says Mrs. George Romney , wife of the president of American Motors , " if anything very important is ever accomplished at parties . "
