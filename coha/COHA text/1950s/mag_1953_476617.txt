BY SOME people reporters are classed with brothel keepers and card sharps , but by Americans they are thought respectable . I spent a while after VJ Day as an American reporter in China , and it struck me that our diplomats and army officers treated us better than European diplomats , say , treated the reporters of their countries . Among the British the diplomats seemed especially close to the business men ; the British being such merchants , it was widely assumed that their consuls and ambassadors took hints from their Chambers of Commerce . French diplomats seemed close to the French Catholic missions , perhaps because the fathers were cultivated , amiable men who kept good wine and knew what was happening in their districts . But with American diplomats it was the press . We reporters dined back and forth with our military or naval attaches or the language officers in our consulates ; we traded information with them ; and we stayed at our consulates when traveling in the interior . The same rule holds in other countries I have visited . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would anyway , but also it underlines that reporters are a privileged caste in American life . We play a big hand in America 's foreign relations , and our vices and virtues have an undue importance . The worst vice , or mistake , of our trade , perhaps , is the persistent belief that we can help persons or causes by telling lies about them . Sometime in the late nineteen-forties I was told , I think reliably , about a pep-talk givenin Shanghai by the new China head of an American news outfit ? I did n't work for it and was n't there myself . The Chinese civil war was in full cry then , and the new man laid it down to his staff that to say anything " against " the Nationalists was to help the Communists , and helping the Communists was unpatriotic ( from the American point of view ) . Of course one could n't give a true account of China then without saying things " against " the Nationalists ? i.e. without touching on the traits that were leading them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit 's reports on China with confidence . Again I was stopped on a Shanghai sidewalk in the spring of 1948 by a friend ? a Chinese reporter , fanatically pro-Nationalist , who was working for a U. S. news agency . The Nationalists were reaching the steep part of the toboggan slide then , and my friend was desperate . " You 've got to help us , " he said , and looked at me intensely and plaintively . He meant I had to help the Nationalists by slanting the news . I felt his distress , but did n't see how I could satisfy him . I asked if I should do anything but try to tell the truth , and he just continued to look plaintive and say I had to help . We got nowhere . I did n't see then , and do n't see now , how a reporter can cure a bad situation by pretending it is good . DLAZING the war I was a propagandist with the OWI , and we bemused ourselves with the slogan " Truth is our weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat of wartime , but it does n't bear much scrutiny otherwise . How can truth be a weapon ? Can one aim or brandish it ? It seems it is just there , and one can only look at it and try to interpret it Perhaps a writer can be truth 's weapon , but hardly vice versa . We propagandists tried to sell America to the foreigners , hiding our country 's faults and enlarging its . virtues , and the more effectively we did this , I think , the more trouble we caused in the end . I believe most citizens of our allies were given the wrong idea of America ? were persuaded to think of it as an impossibly generous nation , without domestic problems to hinder its altruism . Their later disillusionment , as the truth came out in postwar years , did much to increase the worldwide bitterness toward us , though of course it was n't the only factor . The same thing happened to the war reputations of Russia and China in America . Our memories are short , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroines , in the propaganda atmosphere , we thought those countries to be . A couple of years after VJ Day we could n't find mean enough words for them . My impression is that England was Less oversold during the war , and that this allowed us to be more friendly to her afterward , though I may be oversimplifying . Another bit of wartime propaganda , from a different quarter , was the tale that the Chinese Reds were " mere agrarian reformers . " This was often voiced by American or European Red sympathizers in China ? I once heard a sympathizer explain earnestly that the Reds were just like Republicans in Minnesota . It used to exasperate one friend of mine , who would acidly tell the dream-spinners they were doing their cause more harm than good . That he was right can he seen in the way the phrase " mere agrarian reformers " has boomeranged . Nowadays a man can try to speak reasonably about the Chinese Reds ' good points , but anyone in the room need only say , " Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he is silenced . There are some fields where fake propaganda may not destroy itself . It may be that lies and rumors when used negatively ? to bring chaos and disharmony to a society one is attacking ? can achieve their goal without rebound . Again , the instilling of weird dogmas into a whole controlled populace , like Russia 's , may work for a few generations at least . But the evidence seems plain that the use of falsehood for positive ends ? in the hope of nurturing . good cheer and fellowship ? is hound to fail when up against the degree of free speech we have in America . This is so obvious that to repeat it is boring . Yet it is constantly overlooked ? specifically it was overlooked again and again in our postwar news coverage of China . Another result of our lies " in favor of " the Nationalists should be noted . The lying so disgusted our better-grade experts on China that some of them felt on their mettle to contradict it ? they were driven to a partisanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been judges ; were led to marshal facts against the nonsense instead of letting them speak for themselves . Thus the tangled web we weave got especially dense in late Nationalist China , and there were some things one could n't possibly get straight then . I have read yards of copy about Chiang Kaishek , for instance , but I doubt if there were many honest words in it . Almost the only people I have met who could speak dispassionately about Chiang were a few elderly Chinese too wise to let their words get into print . It is doubtful if history has a chance of understanding Chiang . If REPORTER , like myself , is tempted to blame the falsehoods on the publishers , especially the big ones ? of chains and the like . Reporters in Asia tend to conceive of big publishers as tycoons who have lost touch with the realities of newsgathcring , if they ever had it . It is doubtless an unfair view , but it fits the situation one sees in the field . Far Eastern , reporters for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are their inferiors in the news-handling game . Some of these reporters , I believe , are willing or unwilling prostitutes ? mouthpieces for the boss 's propaganda . Others are simply blocked from getting their views into print ; they are well paid , but if they send cables that are forthright on controversial issues these are thrown away ? a system especially common in big staffwritten publications , where a story goes through many hands and in its final version is drawn from many sources . Someone in these production lines will usually he guided by the publisher 's notions , it seems , even if the reporter himself wo n't . Except for a few charlatans it does n't seem that reporters want to be prostitutes , though some people may think so . I suppose most reporters join the trade through idealism ? no sane person would do it through avarice anyway . We get into it eagerly when young ; then as time goes on we acquire families and rigid living standards ; we find we ca n't afford to quit or be fired ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trap has been strengthened in recent years , I believe , by the retirementpay and severance-pay agreements the Newspaper Guild has forced on publishers . These make it harder for a man to quit a job he has held for any number of years , because in doing so he must forfeit months ' worth of pay that has been set aside for him in benefits . The benefits are a carrot the reporter can see but can not touch unless he finishes his life stretch without causing trouble . However noble in purpose , the agreements tend to make peons of us . The only safeguard I have seen against the centralization of power in the hands of irresponsible publishers ? so far as Asiatic reporting goes anyway ? is the practice of using bylines on stories . If a story has a byline there is a straight link between the reporter , one individual , and the reader , another . The reporter , thus identified and laid bare , sees that he has a duty to the reader ? in some ways apart from his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent man he will live up to it . His independence is also braced by the byline practice . He can refuse to sign his name , for instance , to things he disapproves of or disagrees with , and public opinion will back him . If he has repute in the trade his publisher will be slow to abuse him or fire him . He has dignity and standing , and this tends to put the game above board . The reporters ' prevailing view of publishers is a caricature of course , and as such may be unfair to them as individuals . Readers are perhaps the basic limitation on reporters , and on publishers too . Byline reporters can not afford to go constantly against readers ' prejudices , no matter how wrong these may be . The role of an ignorant or unprincipled publisher in this situation is to give the prejudicesundue weight and to add those of his own . He does n't create the problem out of air ; all concerned arc prisoners of the times to some degree . Anyhow , it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the field , to trust them and leave them alone . It would be foolishly optimistic to predict that this rule will prevail , but if it does n't we seem bound to get a more and more dishonest press , with more and more ? and quite sensible ? public distrust of the written word . III s INCE the war I have worked chiefly for publications that have given writers their heads ? promoted creativity instead of subservience to the home-office . The paper I worked for in China let us roam at will . We were allowed to decide for ourselves where the hot spots were , to go and look at them directly , and to describe them in our own way . Because of this we had an advantage on our rivals . I think of one paper especially ; it usually had more men in China than we , and very good ones too , but they were tied down to fixed positions and made to write in a stylized way , often about things they could n't visit and study at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education from their work than we did , and that their readers suffered from it . Our paper was tolerant , polite , liberal , and fond of good craftsmanship . A reporter working for it ? at least in a distant country ? was free so far as the content of his stories went ; and concerning their form he was bound by the scantest minimum of editorial prejudices . These prejudices , such as they are , are among our most interesting trade secrets . On the paper I could never get away with the word " people " as used in the plural sense ? as meaning humanity in general , or " folks . " Phrases like " many people here are saying . . . " or " people in Shanghai are feeling the coal shortage this winter . . . " are handy for impressionistic writing , and I am sure the idiom is legalized by usage . Yet whenever I said " people " it came out " persons " in the paper , and this would give a droll look to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling the copy , had a fixation on the matter , perhaps dinned into him in childhood by schoolmarm . I must have tried " people " a score of times , but I never put it across . There was a slight prejudice in favor of the past tense . If I were writing about a situation involving a General Wang , I might say " General Wang says so and so " ? perhaps in contradiction to a General Chen , who was saying something else . The job of the present tense was to convey that General Wang 's habitual line of talk was being described ? the line put out day after day , to all comers . Yet in the paper the word " says " would often be changed to " said . " I suppose the theory was that if I had heard the General say it he must have said it at a specific time , and a time prior to my writing of the story ; by such a theory " says " would be wrong because General Wang might be asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought the change a mistake , and likewise droll in effect , though I never protested about it . The opposition was n't so rigid in this case as in that of " people . " " Says " had about a fifty-fifty chance . There was a prejudice that sentences should be short and paragraphs should be short . This was based on sound principles , in my opinion , but I think it led to boredom when made into a flat rule . If I sent a long paragraph the people at home broke it up like convicts breaking rocks . It came out in neat little uniform pieces , though I feel sure readers would have been glad to see a long one for a change . I know a magazine that runs foot-Iong paragraphs and gets away with it . ( Most publishers can quote polls or surveys to disprove this point . The answer seems to be that publishers might well stop taking polls and resume doing their own thinking . It seems to me publications are good when they bear the stamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called average reader , a dull fellow . ) T HERE was a strong feeling against the first person singular on our paper , as I believe there was throughout the American news trade . This was a rebound against the abuses of glory hunters , those who would beat the I keys off their typewriters , as the saying goes , and thus raise the gorges of their colleagues . Again , the rule seemed a good one carried too far . The first personneed n't be egotistical ; when used properly it can be just a reminder that the writer was one human being there on the scene , taking his impressions and thinking his thoughts . The rule leads to awkward paraphrases ? " this reporter saw . . . , " " So-and-so told this correspondent . . . " ? which in themselves are blights . " I " is the shortest word in the language , and " me " is n't far behind , and we suffer if we deny ourselves these conveniences . The paper had no prejudice at all , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs or opening gambits ? and this was unusual . Some papers drill their men strictly on leads . There is a saw that the first paragraph should state the " who , when , where , how , and why " of a story ? i.e. give an outline so the reader will know what he is in for . This is a handy device , it seems , and one to be mastered by writers for use when it suits them ; it is also a fit exercise for breaking the spirit of youngsters ; but when applied constantly it is a strait jacket on men who have gone far enough to think up their own tricks of inveigling readers . Reporters have more fun when they write straight for the public ? not for a shellbacked editor ? and I believe this pays off . A British reporter I knew once cabled a typhoon story from Hongkong that began with the dictionary account of the word " typhoon " and that did n't reveal till the third paragraph that he , the reporter , had been anywhere near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am sure the readers liked it . Yet I have heard it was a bitter pill to one of his rivals , who was also in Hongkong and writing about the same storm . This second reporter was a good man of letters too , but he felt his editors would not let such unorthodox nonsense by . One thing we had to face on our paper ? not so much a prejudice as a fact of life ? was the American headline style . American headlines must have verbs in them , preferably short , aggressive ones . This goes badly with some stories that reporters for non-hidebound papers like to write : " situationets " or impressionistic essays ; things without movement or action ; descriptions of scenes at instants . If consistently done , these pieces give no grounds for headlines with " punchy " verbs ; when such headlines are put on them they misrepresent the text and confuse the reader . On occasion a reporter will anticipate this problem of the headline writer and will throw some action into the story to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetters himself and gives up the chance to do a good job . Sometimes the dilemma is solved by insertion into the headline of the preposterous verb " SEEN " ? " CHINESE SEEN I IN HAPPY OVER COAL PRICES . " But there is no way out , really , short of overthrowing the system . The South China Morning Post in Hongkong uses heads without verbs ? " CHIN ESE UNHAPPY " or " PRICE OF COAL . " These strike a newcomer as odd , but in truth they give a muchneeded freedom . The American way with front pages takes the vice still farther . Our front pages try to mix oil with water ? try at the same time to be vehicles of information and newsstand posters for drawing customers . This leads to a bad conflict . The rare stories of mine that got on the front pages were much more likely than the others to bear headlines distorting their sense , and I believe a conscientious reporter should stay off the front page when he can . Here again , I think , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this custom papers cover their front pages with ads and do their touting on separate posters . The crooked steers in such posters are fully as bad , I think , as those in American front-page heads ? indeed they are sometimes fantastic ? but they do n't defile the text itself . You escape them once you buy the paper and carry it home ; you escape them entirely if you subscribe by mail . IV W HEN I was leaving for China I was told by our paper 's foreign editor that he - did n't really look on himself as foreign editor for Asia , but left that job to a correspondent in the region whom he thought more competent . He told me to report to this correspondent and be guided by him , and this was a sound order but hard to obey . It was like pulling teeth to get the correspondent to say anything that might border on interference with me , and with one exception I could learn from him only by example . The exception was this : after much importuning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had perhaps noticed that one way for American reporters to go wrong in China was by getting involved in details ? by acting as if they were with Chinese papers ? by not seeing the woods for the trees . In the next years I kept checking this against experience , and I believe it was the best advice one could get . Some reporters in China acted ? usually were made to act ? as if they were covering Washington . They settled in a main city like Nanking or Shanghai and got wired up with the government , the regular diplomatic sources , and the Chinese press , official and unofficial . They were then in the formal news stream , and if anything came along that was deemed to be news by this stream they got it . They were like terriers at a rat hole . Those who worked for daily papers needed a rat a day , or close to it . Those who worked for news agencies needed more , since they served both morning and evening papers at home . If a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a temptation to pretend otherwise ? to choose a shadow and make as plausible a growling and fuss over it as possible . Being committed to the one hole , reporters were hindered from wandering and sniffing into other channels , though there were a great many of these . An arbitrary American pattern of coverage ? including formalized ideas of what makes news plus a superstitious liking for the twenty-four hour rhythm ? had been clamped on China , an inappropriate place for it . Chinese events did not unfold in twenty-four-hour units . It was possible to cover China on a day-to-day basis , more or less , if you flitted from topic to topic there , taking each by itself . But if you tried to chop the " main news stream " into daylengths you were lost . Some days you would be dealing with trivialities compared to others . Sometimes you would be giving minute details , day after day , of the battle for a given city , when with one good dispatch you could handle it for a week to the satisfaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be unable to do it justice quickly for lack of background knowledge , but you would cable on it at nightfall anyway . It was a corrupting system . The latest bit of twenty-four hour lunacy I saw was in Korea . In Korea it came about for a while that the American news agencies were competing with each other on the question of how many yards the Eighth Army had gained each day , or perhaps how close its forward elements had got to some major goal like Seoul or the 38th Parallel . This yardage business had almost nothing to do with the war 's progress as on some days the Army was zooming up good roads into vacuums and on others was delaying by intent or facing an especially bad ridge . But it took control nevertheless . I once traveled awhile in Korea with two other reporters , including one who was in the toils of yardage . In our progress we often stopped at the headquarters of a corps , division , or regiment and talked to the intelligence officer there . The yardage man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend eternity measuring the distance from the front line to Seoul , the magic goal of that instant . Sometimes the third man and I had no chance to ask questions of our own , but we could n't complain for we knew about the wringer our friend was caught in . In Hongkong and Tokyo I have tried to follow the Korean War through dispatches such as he was writing , and I have hardly learned a thing ; the war 's dynamic factors ? morale , strategy , geography , weather , and so forth ? having been driven out of consideration by the formalistic nonsense . NOTHER plague of formalism , though not tied directly to the twenty-four-hour bug , afflicted the coverage of China in late ' 48 and early ' 49 , when the Reds were making their big sweep from Manchuria down across the Yangtze . I was in America then , try-ing to follow this event , but I seldom had much idea of what was happening . ( It should be said that some of our best reporters got cooped up in Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their talents to the general scene , but even so the press seemed to cripple itself gratuitously . ) The fall of cities became the vogue . Cities ' falls were rarely im-portant in the Chinese civil war , often being foregone conclusions dictated by more crucial happenings ? military , political , psychological , or economic ? at other places or other times . Many cities were entered with only a token ballet of warfare . Yet while each entering was in progress the American papers had scream-ing headlines about it , and when there were no ent.erings the subject of China tended to vanish from the front pages ? often from inside pages as well . It was like an account of a football game that dealt only with touchdown plays , however routine these plays might be . In China an American official who had come from a European country once told me about two reporters who had served there for different American papers . One of these men had strained everything , he said , to get the news right on the dot , and had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other had taken his time , and if there had been a news trend lasting a couple of weeks had been content to get aboard anywhere in that stretch ? had preferred being right to being fast . In the official 's view the latter man had done a far better job ? better perspective , more accuracy , more sanity in general ? than his rival . The same rule applied to China , and I suspect applies to most foreign countries . China has a different time sense from the West 's . One thing I learned there ? after many ludicrous mistakes ? was that one could n't predict Chinese timing with any hope of accuracy . Often it was easy to see that the Reds would take a city in due course . But trouble ensued if one went beyond this and decided they would take it in a given month or year . Events in China , no matter how feasible , used to remain suspended while their time ripened , a mysterious process that could n't be understood by a formula . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you might finish it ? all passengers on the bus were ready to have it break down , or have the bridges wash out , and they were not annoyed when these things happened . Processes were not forced into timetables .. The Chinese patience contrasted sharply with the American do-it-now approach , and I think it had much bearing on the failure of this approach when used in China by our government . I think our do-it-now approach with news encouraged this national error by giving a false idea of China 's pace . A NOTHER thing that got in our way was the American liking for " hard " news ? facts , figures , and direct quotations . Direct quotes from Chinese officials were nearly always misleading . In China ? as perhaps in most places ? speech is not used only to convey the truth . Often its purpose is to evade the truth or mix it with politeness , coddling , flattery , or some other lubricant . If a Chinese artisan wants to quit his job he makes up some story about a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , and when the time is up he does n't reappear . He goes through the pretense to avoid argument , to avoid the embarrassment of telling his master why he wants to leave him ; the convention is understood by all , and no one is hurt . In Chinese politics under Chiang Kai-shek there were all kinds of embroidery on truth . The Communists were called " bandits , " an absurdly euphemistic name . Inflationary spurts of the currency were called " fluctuations , " though basically they spurted in the one direction only . Dreamlike statements ? easily proved wrong by Western logic ? were made about the progress of the war . This was an old Chinese custom , inherited from the Manchu Dynasty and earlier . Our rigid system often failed to allow for such twists . When the Chinese artisan was leaving the shop the system would have played his words literally : " ' My mother has died , ' Lao Chang , 33 , of Ritter Well Lane , announced this morning ; ' I must take a fortnight 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no clue that it was a manner of speaking . In 1948 the Nationalists set up a new currency , suppressed the black market awhile , and vowed that inflation was a thing of the past . Anyone who knew or thought much about it could see this was all wrong ? so ingrained was the inflation tendency ? yet the vows , being in direct " hard " quotes , were printed deadpan by the American press . Some important man had said them ; sayings of important men were news ; reporters who questioned such sayings ? tried to get them in perspective ? could be . called editorializers ; so the reader was left to cope unaided with the dream words . There were many such cases . In the spring of ' 48 Generalissimo Chiang told the world the Reds would be cleared from below the Yellow River forthwith ; his statement was printed solemnly . throughout America ; but of course the clearing never took place . At the start of ' 47 the Nationalists passed a constitution that some American reporters classed with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by Chiang himself , but not till our public had been well confused . As a rule the desire to spread falsehoods in behalf of causes , which I mentioned earlier , contributed to the press 's mishandling of these things ; but blind reliance on thehardness of quotes was at the core of it too . Even more than other officials , those of China disliked being frank if they thought their words might be attributed to them in print . Sometimes they let a reporter in on fascinating secrets and insights , but only if they could trust him to pretend he got them from the blue . This by itself assured that hares quotes from China would be a delusion . China did n't lend itself to a statistical approach , either , during the twilight of our press coverage there . Many parts of Chinese life had never been fitted out with statistics . Other parts had been so fitted , but with these the tailoring might be odd ? you could learn by the Nationalist census figures , for instance , that Ningsia Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 6G6,890 souls , and that 753,400 of them were Moslems . American reporters venturing into our bailiwick from Japan , a much-Westernized country then being measured by platoons of SCAP economists , had usually to spend a week or two getting adjusted . They would shuffle around our Shanghai quarters for a few days asking us about the " situation , " and in the end they would wretchedly blurt out a demand for our " files of figures . " When we had grasped their meaning we would always have to tell them we had no such files ? that China made herself known to outsiders through rumors , but not through tabulations . They would resist this truth , but it would prevail in the end , and they would find themselves adrift with the rest of us . In general I believe speed , literal-mindedness , and worship of detail were harmful traits in our reporting from China . China was a vast , complicated place , remote from the United States . To convey a notion of it one needed room for lots of background matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed license to write freely and evocatively . Without these things , I believe , one 's stuff would be usually misleading And always routine and flat ? a mere recording of surface details for the initiated . V these vices of quickness and hardness ? if it is right to call them vices lay the competitive system . During our work in China I could find no value in this system . News-agency , or wire-service , competition was the worst . Among American news agencies the goal with a story was to get it into as many ? and as large ? papers throughout the country as possible . The greatest aids in doing this , I was told by friends in the agencies , were speed and sensationalism . If the UP got a story onto the wires a few minutes ahead of the AP , the chances were that many papers would set it in type at once ; if the AP 's story , when it came in , was equal to the UP 's or only slightly better , the UP 's would be run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice versa of course ? and this would be a score . As for sensationalism , many editors wanted stories that would justify startling front-page heads ? the kind that would sell copies on the newstands ? and the idea was to furnish these . According to agency men , reliability came behind speed and sensationalism in deciding a story 's success . As part of the competitive system the big agencies kept close watch on the play their stories got through the country , and the findings were quickly relayed to reporters in the field , who were supposed to be guided by them . To the extent they were so guided , as far as I could see , they were usually led astray . They kept their eyes on each other instead of on their subject-matter . They were inclined to copy each other ? write the same kind of stories ? so there would be no question of being scooped , and this worked against imagination and enterprise . They were driven toward " hard " news because , whether misleading or not , it was unassailable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off half-cocked for speed 's sake , not daring to take time for a proper job . They pulled each other overboard ; they wrote stories they were ashamed of because they believed their competition would do the same , and this became a vicious circle . A strong binder in the competitive structure was the " rocket , " or cable from home telling a reporter what the opposition was carrying and asking why he could n't furnish the same or better . I have often been present when rockets were landing , and I have seen some brave conduct in the face of them . In early 1951 an agency man in Tokyo got word from the Chinese Nationalist mission there that the Chinese Reds were pulling out of the Korean War . This was absurd ? not only had the Nationalist mission proven its unreliability again and again , but at that time the Reds were doing well in Korea and plainly meant to do better if they could . Yet the agency man cabled the story and it got a big play in the States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began whizzing to the Tokyo offices of the other two American agencies . I happened to be camping in one of those offices then , using its typewriters , paper , news , coffee , and other facilities , and I can report that its staff held firm for the whole three or four days it took the sensation to blow over . The rockets did n't say the home office wanted the staff to get aboard the story and cable it , but this was their meaning ? they nagged constantly with suggestions that the story might conceivably be Lrue , or at least could n't be disproved . It would have been easier for the Tokyo men to give in . This would have relieved them of charges they were being scooped , and by the time the news could be proved false ? weeks in the future ? most people would have forgotten who had been spreading it . Yet they held , and I think most agency men would like to hold in such cases , though they know there is a limit to how often they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more to blame than the others , of course , if blame is the word , and agency men have been mentioned here because their field is where the pressure is worst . A study of that field is a study of how human beings can be oppressed by their own institutions . I believe the competitive system is in no way a stimulus to enterprise in the news business . I believe it is a bar to enterprise and a whip for galley slaves ? a means of enforcing the most hack notions of the most hack people in the home offices on field reporters who deserve better .
