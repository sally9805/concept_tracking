txt Senate and House negotiators agreed ? today on a $5,157,232,500 authorization for the Mutual Security Program , but a move was under way in the Senate Appropriations Committee to reduce the amount by $1,000,000,000 . Retrenchment plans of some committeemen were brought into the open when Senator Everett M. Dirksen , Republican of Illinois , asked George M. Humphrey , the Secretary of the Treasury , his opinion as to the effect of such a cut . The Treasury chief said it was the responsibility of the group to scrutinize all items and to be satisfied of their need , but he added : " I think it would be very foolish of you to take a broad axe and cut off $1,000,000,000 . " The Senator said after the hearing that there was a fairly well developed sentiment among corn- , mitteemen of both parties to cut the amount authorized anywhere from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,0001 land that he merely wanted to get the Secretary 's reaction to such a possibility . The total can be cut ? despite today 's agreement on authorizing the funds  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash needed . The conference split the difference between conflicting authorization items in the House and Senate bills and also reached compromises on controversial provisions intended to restrict European military aid funds and to finance the removal of surplus American farm products . On the first of these propositions , the House had voted to make half the military aid funds for Western Europe " available only to the European Defense Community . " The effect of the provision would have been to rescind about $1,000,000,000 of these funds if the countries concerned failed to ratify the treaty for a single European Army . The Senate conferees held out for three days in favor of the language voted by their chamber , which would have left it for President Eisenhower to decide whether the money should beheld up . Mutual security experts told the conference that , under the House provision , they could not even let contracts for materiel that would not be delivered until 1956 . Under the conference agreement , half of the $2,129,689,870 of European military aid funds would be earmarked for the defense community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contracts immediately ; What will be done with the equipment in event the treaty is not ratified will be decided by Congress on a recommendation from the President . House conferees who expressed satisfaction with the compromise said it represented a more positive approach to the problem in that it raised an inducement for European states to ratify their pact rather than a threat of retaliation . Exchange Plan Modified The other important compromise concerned an amendment fo the Senate bill . It would have directed that funds for contracting materiel abroad be used to acquire the currencies of the Governments concerned . This would be done under agreements committing the dollars thus exchanged to the purchase of surplus farm products . The foreign currencies then would be used to pay for the materiel made abroad . The trouble with the plan , from the point view of the Mutual Security Agency , was that the countries of , Western Europe with the industrial capacity for manufacturing military weapons were not the countries that needed our surplus farm products . Under the compromise arrangement , not less than $100,000,000 nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surplus removal scheme . In addition to e. manufacturin weapons , the currencies could ' be used under the compromise to purchase and stock-pile scarce strategic materials and to increase their production abroad . The compromise included a further diluting effect in that economic as well as military aid funds might be used for moving surplus farm goods . The chief neutralizers , however , were the numerical limits placed on the plan . Senate negotiators also accepted a House provision limiting to 10 per cent the amount of funds that might be transferred at the discretion of the President from one section to another in the foreign laid bill . The Senate had voted to make this limitation 15 per cent . Three money items of $100,000 , - 000 each had separated the original Senate and House versions of the bill. , These resulted from House cuts of that amount in military aid to Western Europe and to the Near East and Africa and for economic aidsto Western Europe . The House cuts were reduced to $50,000,000 each . The final amounts authorized today included $2,129 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic aid to Europe and $355,212,000 of military aid for the Near East aild Africa ; most of the latter going to Greece and Turkey , The bill totals $5,157,232,500 . The Senate had voted to authorize $5,318,000,000 ; the House , $1,998 , - 000,000 . President Eisenhower had asked $5,474,000,000 . A conference report embodying the agreement of the Senate and House negotiators will be submitted to each branch early next week and is expected to pass without a hitch . Secretary Humphrey told the Senate Appropriations group that foreign aid should not be continued " on such a large scale " in the future but should be ' ' on a rapidly declining basis . " ' Can and Should ' Afford It He said , " I believe we can and should , " when asked whether the nation could afford the program proposed by the Administration .

E. Halaby , Deputy on European Aid Affairs to the Assistant Secretary of Defense , told the committee that up to $1,500,000,000 of military aid funds for Western Europe would be devoted to the offshore procurement program ? that is , foreign material contracting . After hearing the Assistant Secretary of Defense Frank Nash in a closed session , however , Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire , the committee chairman , said this amount might be reduced if some weapons made abroad proved costlier than they could be produced at home .
