txt We now ate witnessing one of those rate cases where the shape of gi eat nations in the futile depends heavily upon the outcome of one battle fought in one small isolated place vet y far away from the places it affects , and by telatively few non This cattle is joined in the Thai hills of norther n Indochina some 100 miles south of Communist China 's southern bolder at a a ossi oad named Dien Bien Phu . It is the climactic battle in months of campaigning . It could well be the decisive battle of the Indochina war . It is being fought between an estimated foice of 10.000 soldiers of the Fiench Union and allied local units on one side and an assaulting at my of Indochinese Communists sat musly estimated betty een 25.000 and 45.000 men . France 's Status at Stake On the outcome of the battle depends not lust the course of usat in 1/1dt:whale , but the po.ition of Fiance in Europe If the Fiench could hold Dien Bien Phu , they could press their Far E.e.t peace con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ask and insist upon fair tenns for the ending of the Indochinese w ar . On the basis of a fair settlement of that ' 1 , , r , Fiance could bring its best troops home from Indochina mud face with some confidence the prospect of Fiench entiance into the European Defense Community . But if the garrison at Dien Bien Phu should be overrun or captured , the stay in Etuope piobably would be very different . There could be no early and proud withdrawal of French forces from Indochina . France would hose to face the choice of an unfavorable end to the Indochina war or such a piotraction of it as probably would seem intolei able in the minds of most Frenchmen . Such an outcome of the battle in the Thai hills would operate heavily against F/cnch ratification of the EDC treaty and might well mean the end of that great project for a European union . ' Likened to Yesteryear This was like those occasions in medieval history when kings sat at a peace table and waited for the battle reports before they drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peace table is set and ordered for Geneva on April 26 . Moscow this week announced that the Chinese Communists would come . There had been some doubt of that . Peking was understood to have been deeply disappointed that Moscow had failed to take China as an equal to a five-pow er conference , China was coming not as a principal , but as a guest of the Soviet Union . However , in the end China agreed to come , and that presumably meant a possibility that China might come prepared to negotiate seriously for an end to the war in Indochina . Thus much depends on the men who are fighting in the flame-wracked and shell-torn little valley in the Thai hills . Effort Keyed to Geneva An air of urgency hangs over the battle . This is the first time in the long years of that war that Ho Chi Minh has risked his best divisions in a major frontal assault on a strong position , strongly held by French faces . He is trying to take Dien Bien Phu by storm , and the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tenacity . Only the approach of the Geneva conference could explain adequately the effort thrown by the Communists into the battle . They are riskingtheir offensive power in one battle Es en if their casualties were only half the numbers claimed by the defenders , the Communists would not soon be able to use again the troops sent into that battle . Plainly , they are doing their utmost to inflict a sharp and damaging defeat on Fiench aims in Indochina before the peace conference meets at Geneva . The stakes were high on the French side as well . The battlefield is 175 miles from the main French positions at Hanoi . The French defenders of the crossroads were isolated except by air . These was no possibility of withdrawal . They could only win , surrender , or be killed . They could be reinforced and supplied by air . They could not be withdrawn by air from a valley with enemy artillery on the surrounding hills which could reach and hit the two airstrips . Facts Still Obscure The immediate local military issue was control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Laos . The Communists have invaded Laos repeatedly by jungle trails , but they have not been able to make their raids on Laos permanent or decisive because they could not move enough supplies with them . They needed Dien Bien Phu to obtain a highway into the heart of Indochina and tip to the frontier of Thailand . To meet this threat , the French were relying on their own troops plus air power borrowed from the United States and accompanied by American mechanics to repair and service the planes . Also , there were American civilian pilots hired from Hong Kong to help in providing the airlift . Someday someone present will write the dramatic story of the battle of Dien Bien Phu . This week the outside world knows little of the actual battle , but much of its importance on the far side of the world where the nations are getting ready to fit the outcome of the battle into the pattern of a possible settlement of the last hot war in the cold war .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
