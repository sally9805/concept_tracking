" Reunification Goal Mr. Rhee said the battle of Korea still was a struggle to avoid World War III , even though it had shifted from military to political fields .

" Mr. Rhee said bluntly : " The war could have been won , but the United Nations deliberately decided against victory as its goal .

" Mr. Rhee again insisted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " This is ample time , " he said , " for the Communists to demonstrate the degree of their sincerity in being willing to settle the issue of their aggressive attacks upon Korea by political means . " Accusations Expected Mr. Rhee asserted : " During the next Several months , we expect to be vilified , slandered , insulted , and denounced in every vile form their ( the Communists ) spiteful ingenuity can invent . The Communists well understand that attack is the best form of defense . In order to defend North Korea , they will accuse the , Republic of Korea of every crime . . They will hint vaguely that if Red China and the puppet regime of North Korea are admitted to the United Nations this event may mark the beginning of a new era of peace . And always they will hold up in the background for everyone to see the awful threat that if their demands are not met , the result may be a regretful outbreak of an atomic war . " " The scenario , " Mr. Rhee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trite with repetition . " But like some of the old popular melodrama of this stage , it is a routine ' which so far has never failed to hold the attention of the world and to win hypnotic attention of many fearful and influential people .
