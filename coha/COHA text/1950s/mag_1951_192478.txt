ALONE HE WENT ( 248 pp. ) - Anthony Richardson-Norton ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Air Marshal Sir Basil Embry , D.S.O. , is today commander in chief of Britain 's Fighter Command . But in May 1940 he was a mere squadron leader , just notified of his promotion to group captain . Promptly he decided to lead his old squadron on a farewell sweep over northern France . An hour or so later , while the rest of the squadron headed home , Group Captain Embry , his plane shot to pieces , was " gently , blissfully " descending upon the German lines by parachute . <P> The Germans captured him , but Embry was back in Britain again within ten weeks . He made his first break-from a marching column of P.W.s-by taking a lightning header into a ditch of muddy water . The guards never saw him go . He exchanged his R.A.F. uniform for " the most beautiful coat he 'd ever seen " ( he borrowed it from a scarecrow ) and headed for the British lines . <P> As Embry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got close enough to be in danger from their artillery , but he never managed to catch them . When he reached the Channel , he found every coastal boat , down to the smallest dinghy , smashed in by <P> German sledge hammers . Recaptured , he killed two guards with a rifle butt and escaped ; recaptured again a few days later by a German patrol , he managed to persuade an enemy intelligence officer that he was an Irish revolutionary whose sole aim was to get back home and be a thorn in the side of the British . " Put me on a German ship , " he begged , " and send me to Ireland ... or let me get to Spain , and there I 'll find a ship . " <P> Embry got into Spain all right-curled up in the tail compartment of a British agent 's car . Meanwhile , in matted beard and filthy clothes , he had witnessed the Germans ' triumphal entry into Paris , carefully studied the layout of a strategic airfield , and spent at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German general . Like most men who escaped through Occupied France , he speaks almost with awe of the peasants and plain folk who unhesitatingly risked their lives to help him on his way . <P> Alone He Went properly should count as an extraordinary story . But its popularity is likely to be dimmed by two defects . One of them : it is written by an R.A.F. colleague of Embry 's , and thus has neither the personal touch of autobiography nor the literary touch of a professional " ghost . " The other : World War II has already produced so many amazing tales that nothing short of a masterpiece is likely to raise much flutter.
