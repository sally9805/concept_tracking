With a trumpeting of Page One headlines , the New York Post ( circ. 390,000 ) last week launched a series on Hearst Columnist Walter Winchell , " probably the biggest success story in American journalism . " To the Post , which has been feuding with Winchell for months , it was a success story without a hero . <P> Post Editor James Wechsler had long been anxious to hang a picture of Winchell for his readers , but he could not find an occasion to his liking . Winchell supplied one by his attacks on Negro Singer Josephine Baker , after she complained that the Stork Club had refused to serve her ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) . When the race-conscious Post took her side , the paper heard that Stork Club Owner Sherman Billingsley had set agents to investigating Post Owner Dorothy Schiff . <P> The Post decided to investigate Billingsley first , then dropped him in favor of his great &; good friend Winchell , because " all the trails seemed to lead to Winchell . " Editor Wechsler sent a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the job before Editor Wechsler sat down to write most of the series himself . <P> Faded Orchids . The Post depicted Walter Winchell as " one of the loneliest men in the world , " though " he assumes that he knows everybody and everybody knows him . . . He made the gossip column a respectable newspaper feature . . . but he spends much of his time justifying the existence of gossip columns and trying to prove he is a heavier thinker than Walter Lippmann . <P> <P> " He is a sucker for the most faded verbal orchid from the most cynical suitor . The worst book will get his best notices if he is favorably mentioned in it ... He feels compelled on all occasions to remind the world that he is a central figure in the history of the 20th century . ' One hundred years from now I 'm the only newspaperman they 'll remember , ' he told a private audience ... He depicts himself as the eternal friend of the underdog ... his only requirement is that the underdog remain forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of statesman , he is handicapped only by misinformation , lack of knowledge , capricious judgment and a cultivated aversion for the reading of books . ' Tell me what 's in it , ' he demands impatiently , ' do n't make me read it . ' " Said the Post : he prefers to let others read , see , listen-and even write-for him . " Winchell 's ' gossip ' ... is primarily the edited product of diligent , harassed press-agents who give him first choice on all evil that they see , hear or overhear-and some of the good , if it involves their own clients . . . The dividends are indirect ; they collect proportionately from their clients for the touch of immortality that goes with the expression : ' He 's close to Winchell . ' " And , added the Post , they live in unholy terror that they will lose that touch .
