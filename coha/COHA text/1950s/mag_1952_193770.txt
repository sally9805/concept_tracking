Aye for Eye <P> Sir : <P> Re the July 14 issue : Let me be one of the thousands to congratulate you and your staff . . . Blessings on you for the courage to come out with political views the way you have . . . Ignore the slams you 'll get ... Truth hurts , and it 's about time someone had guts enough to publish the truth . . . I 've read that " Eye of the Nation " article five times . <P> GWYNNE DE COVERLY Chicago <P> Sir : <P> Hurrah to TIME for exposing the Republican National Committee and the Taft tactics . I had begun to believe that TIME too could see corruption only within the Democratic Party ; but right makes for right , and the convention itself upheld your stand in its decision . . . The Republican Party 's candidate will go to the people this November with clean hands . <P> GEO . D. CARLOCK JR . Honey Grove , Texas <P> Sir : <P> I suppose the big eye on your convention cover once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the picture at some of the goings-on it saw in Chicago . <P> KENNETH F. HALL <P> Anderson , Ind . <P> King Kong Cuts Sir : <P> . . . Each time King Kong is revived TIME , July 14 , more of the picture is cut . Not since 1933 have audiences seen the scene on the cliff in which Kong sits to examine his prize ( Fay Wray ) and tears off part of her dress ... Is this scene in the 1952 revival or does bluenose prudery win another round ? . . . <P> EDWARD CONNOR New York City <P> RKO happily reports that Kong continues to triumph over prudery. - ED . <P> <P> Munich : Kennedy v. Churchill <P> Sir : <P> In your June 9 Letters Column , Randolph S. Churchill says TIME was wrong in referring to Czechoslovakia as " Britain 's ally " and denounces the " holier than thou " attitude adopted by some Americans towards the English in regard to Munich , and states that England had no more moral or legal obligation to defend Czechoslovakia than had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and the U.S. towards Czechoslovakia were on a par . . . <P> Britain 's military alliance with France under the Locarno Pact of 1925 . . . although it did not guarantee Czechoslovakia against aggression as it did Belgium , made it inevitable that if France went to war to fulfill its own direct obligation under the Franco-Czech Treaty of 1924 , England would be drawn in ... England was deeply committed , by her treaty with France and by her official actions . . . The illustrious father of Mr. Churchill has admitted that Great Britain was deeply involved and that " it must be recorded with regret that the British Government not only acquiesced but encouraged the French Government in a fatal course " ( Churchill , The Gathering Storm ) . <P> The U.S. had no political involvement in Europe in 1938 . . . President Roosevelt never sent congratulations to Mussolini for arranging the Munich Conference , as alleged by Randolph Churchill . . . The President 's telegram to Mussolini on Sept. 27 was a final appeal asking Mussolini to intervene with Hitler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , B.C. <P> <P> Lobstercide <P> Sir :
