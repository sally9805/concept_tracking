txt Spee PI . to Two , Now Yowl Testes . WASHINGTON , Sept. ** of State Dean Acheson charged today that Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower " tortures the facts " when blaming him for the " political catastrophe " of the Korean war . The . Secretary , in a ' news conference statement as direct and as personal as tli attack made against him by the Republican Presidential candidate last Monday in a speech in Cincinnati , said the general had ' been " wholly in accordance " with the views expressed by Mr. Acheson in January , 1950 . Text of Secretary Acheson 's statement is on Page 8 . It was on Secretary Acheson 's address to the IsTational Press Club on Jan. 12 , 1950 , that General Eisenhower based his charge that the Secretary had been personally responsible for the aggression in Korea five months later . Mr. Acheson , the general declared , had drawn this country 's " defensive perimeter " to exclude areas on the Asiatic ? mainland " such as Korea , " and in effect had served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of the United States against military attack . Decision Laid to Military The Secretary told a news , con- , ference today that the " defensive perimeter " to which he had referred had been determined by the military authorities , and that General Eisenhower , as Army Chief of Staff from 1945 to 1948 , was ' " wholly " in accord with that decision . " The " defensive perimeter " as set forth by Mr. Acheson in January , 1950 , ran " along the Aleutians to Japan and then goes to the RYukyus ' and " from/the Ryukyus to the Philippine Islands . " - Of possible targets of aggression outside . the United States " defensive ' perimeter , " Mr. Acheson at that time had this to say : " So far as the military security of other areas in the Pacific is // concerned , it must be clear that no person can guarantee those areas against military attack . " In addition to Korea , as cited by General Eisenhower , those " other areas in the Pacific " beyond the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chinese Nationalist Government , re- , cipient of United States military aid , and site of a United States military mission advising Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on the defense of the islands Mr. Acheson left'no doubt today that he believed the general himself shared the responsibility for drawing that particular defense line . " This is the line , " the Secretary said this morning , " which the United States had to defend alone if necessary and to man with its own troops . The defensive perimeter as I described it was the line developed by our military authorities at that time . I can not believe General Eisenhower now means to imply that Korea should have been included fly me within the defensive perimeter and that it should have been manned by American troops . Certainly , as Chief of Staff Of the Army , his opinion was quite ' to the contrary and wholly in accordance with the statement I made . " Mr. Acheson took issue not only with the general 's charges but with the manner in which they were made . He accused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying things that the ' speech did not say and leaving out others that were said . " The general could have discovere --  ' this , " said Mr. Acheson , ? " by reading my speech . " He also protested that the general . " or those upon whom he relied , " had taken a sentence from the Press Club speech out of context , " cutting it out from between two other sentences they quoted to make their point . " By such omissions , according to Mr. Acheson , General Eisenhower misrepresented the " defensive perimeter " statement and gave the impression that the Secretary minimized the importance of military considerations . The Secretary , who had prepared his news conference statement on the correct assumption that a question would be asked about the general 's charges , said he- was taking the matter up not only because he disliked being misquoted on a matter of real importance , but to make absolutely clear two points essential to an understanding of United States foreign policy . The first , he said , was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a military line . . Responsibility for Defense The second point , he went on , was that the United States , then as now , " had great interes1 in the security and well-being of other nations in the Pacific area . " He had emphasized in that speech , nearly three years ago , the ( need for working with those countries against " subversion , penetration , political disintegration and economic disorders , " the Secretary Said . It would not have been " just or wise or possible " for the United States alone to bear the responsibility of defending those areas , Mr. Acheson added , and their defense lay first , therefore , with them- ' selves and then with the commitI meats of the civilized world under the United Nations Charter . " I can not believe this vital point of foreign policy is meant to be challenged , " he said in conclusion , ' any more than the first . " Agreeing that the " defensive perimeter " now as in 1950 was a ' military responsibility , the Secretary declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter , addressing the Secretary three times to determine " whether that defensive perimeter today applies to the same countries " as it did in 1950 , was ad-1 vised by Mr. Acheson to ask the military authorities . In a supplementary statement is-1 sued several hours after the news conference , Mr. Acheson dealt with the argument that the Soviet Union could have vetoed any Security Council proposal to take action against Communist aggression . That argument , officials said , had been made in an article this morning by Arthur Krock , the Washington correspondent of THE NEw YORK TIMES . The Secretary said that when the United States went to the Security Council after the attack in Korea had taken place , " We were ready with plans to go to the General Assembly if Malik had returned to the Council to cast a veto . " Jacob Malik , the Soviet delegate to the United Nations , was not in attendance at that time , and did not veto the Security Council 's resolution to resist the aggression . Mr. Krock had pointed out that neither Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no Soviet veto would be forthcoming . " Mr. Acheson held that the Charter of the United , Nations did not limit members to actions decided upon by the Security Council . He quoted Article 51 to the effect that nothing " shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations , until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security . " Korea is not a member of the United Nations and therefore an attack - on that country presumably would not fall within the terms of Article 51 . The " veto " argument , the Secretary added , also " overlooks the authority of the General Assembly . " to which the United States would have taken the Korean case if a veto had blocked action in the Security Council . He said in con-clusion : " The nations of the world community are committed to maintain and if necessary to restore international peace . The Charter provides the means whereby their strength can be combined for Charter purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not a weak reed to rely upon . " Mr. Krock made the following reply : " I am advised by the State Department that the second statement issued by Mr ; Acheson today was in answes to my article on the editorial page of THE NEw YORK TIMES this morning /Its elaborate casuistry is enough to explain why : it . - was so belated . " Just as Mr. Acheson could not possibly have known in January , 1950 , that Soviet Russia , would be boycotting the United Nations on - June 27 , so that it could not use its veto against the military sanctions that in its absence were voted by the Security Council , so equally he could not know then or now that the General Assembly would have voted them if Soviet Russia had been present in the Security Council in June and cast its veto . " But his post facto prescience does not touch on the main and costly error of his Jan. 12 , 1950 , speech to the National Press Club . That was to notify the only aggressors in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use force against aggression ; and thus to advise them that , though we were responsible for the security of Japan , we would not use this force alone against aggression on Formosa or in Korea  --  both vital to the defense of Japan . " The reason why Mr. Acheson throught it necessary to give Soviet Russia that free and precise information is still a mystery . "
