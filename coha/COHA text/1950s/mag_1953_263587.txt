When just about everybody who was anybody in Dallas suddenly began sleeping on candy-striped bed sheets three years ago , they had a reasonable explanation : " Mr. Stanley said it was the thing to do . " Mr. Stanley is Stanley Marcus , 48 , president of the famed Neiman-Marcus luxury specialty store , and the benevolent dictator of fashion not only for Dallas but for the whole Southwest . He has made himself so mainly by superb showmanship and a solemn dedication to his job that causes competitors to refer waspishly to Neiman 's as " The Cathedral . " <P> Last week Showman Marcus put on his biggest show of the year- his 16th annual Fall Fashion Exposition , in which the store had invested $50,000 and 12,000 man-hours of labor . By the shrewd device of awarding " Distinguished Service " plaques to outstanding designers , Mr. Stanley , as usual , had brought headline names* scurrying to Dallas from all over the world . Many another headliner came from distant points just to bid for the privilege of paying $12.50 ( turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the 1,000 paying guests in the first-night audience . <P> ( Tickets sold out so fast that even Mrs. <P> H. L. Hunt , wife of Texas ' multimillionaire oilman , had to take second-night seating . ) To his dazzled guests , Mr. Stanley showed $4,500,000 worth of new wares , including $500,000 worth of furs , $350,000 worth of dresses ( three Charles James models were priced at $2,000 each ) , and $3,500,000 Neiman-Marcus ' sales soared . Many of the guests had brought lavishly even before the show , just to be sure they had the proper things to wear on opening night . <P> Golden Fleece . With just such a combination of showmanship and salesmanship , Stanley Marcus has helped build Neiman-Marcus sales from $2,600,000 a year in 1926 , the year he joined the family sales force , to their present $20 million level . He now hopes to boost them 25% with the new $7,500,000 addition to the main store ( he opened a new $1,600,000 suburban branch in 1951 ) . <P> Like his three younger brothers , Eddie , 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Stanley still likes to handle sales to special customers . When one East Texan could not think of what to buy his nine womenfolk , Stanley Marcus suggested nine $750 coats made of vicua ( " fleece of the Andes " ) , the costliest cloth on earth . <P> " That 's a danged good idea , " said the industrialist , " and I 'll have one too . " The store has since made the coat so popular that once , when it put $150,000 worth of coats in a window display , it sold out in a few days .
