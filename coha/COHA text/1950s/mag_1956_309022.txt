The U.S. has long doled out billions of dollars in pensions and bonuses on the theory that it should repay able-bodied veterans , their widows and dependent children for time spent and privations suffered in the armed services in time of war . Last week this theory was examined by a seven-member commission appointed by President Eisenhower and headed by Old Soldier ( and onetime Veterans Administrator ) Omar Bradley. * The commission 's unanimous conclusion : the theory is nonsense and payments to nondisabled veterans gradually should be eliminated . <P> The Bradley commission showed considerable bravery in tossing its controversial recommendations into the shot and shell of an election year . Indeed , the commission acknowledged the political power of veterans ' organizations by noting that existing veterans ' programs " have been enacted in response to minority pressures . " But more than a year of intensive study had proved to the commission that the old arguments for gifts to nondisabled veterans are outdated , if not phony , today . <P> Including his free medical care , food , clothing , tax-free allowances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with economic hardship , actually has a higher income ( about $4,000 ) than his civilian contemporary ( about $3,700 ) , the commission reported . When he returns to civilian life , instead of putting him at a disadvantage , his training gives him an advantage . World War II veterans , for example , are making more money ( $3,978 in the 25-34 age category , which includes two-thirds of them ) on the outside , are better educated and own at least as many homes as their nonveteran counterparts . As for the " wasted years , " a survey found that for every veteran who said he had been hurt by his service , four said they had been helped . Moreover , expanded social security now gives to the entire population ( including veterans ) what service pensions once gave to veterans alone . <P> For wartime veterans the commission was strongly in favor of temporary readjustment aids such as those in the G.I. Bill of Rights , and urged that they be given the stature of basic principle . But as for the long pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uniform was worn for a while , the Government owes the former wearer a living . The ordinary losses of time and opportunity while in military service must be regarded as part of the responsibilities of a citizen , and only extreme or extraordinary handicaps should be regarded as creating an obligation on the Government .
