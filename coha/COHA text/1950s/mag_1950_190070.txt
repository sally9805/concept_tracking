All through the U.S. , Moscow newspapers jubilantly reported , draftees were fleeing from their medical examinations-cold proof of " the lack of desire of American youth to serve as cannon fodder for the sake of increased profits for Wall Street . " <P> What Moscow took for a comforting backfire was actually the kick of a self-starter . The U.S. was just getting its draft machinery going again , after 17 months in dead storage . So far , few draftees had actually been inducted : men called up for examination got three weeks before reporting for service . Not until mid-September would sizable numbers of men ( mostly at the top age of the draft call , 25 years old ) be inducted . The nation 's 3,659 local draft boards meanwhile were trying to update old files . The boards themselves had been snoozing in peacetime , and many a young draft-ager had neglected to keep the Government posted on new addresses , new illnesses , new marriages and new babies . <P> " Not one in a hundred of these guys is ducking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third of the selectees were n't showing up for physicals . In New York , with a 23% no-show , Selective Service Director Candler Cobb growled menacingly about calling in the FBI , then quieted down as newspapers discovered that many of his delinquents were already in the service ( one had just left for the Pacific ) . Cases of actual malingering were few : a handful of inductees in Virginia were caught trying to flunk intelligence tests ; in Washington , a 19-year-old told the judge he had stolen a car because the draft would n't take anyone convicted of a felony . Most of the grousing was good-natured . Sample : in Los Angeles , a gag was going the rounds that many young men were worried about a new social disease : gontoKorea . <P> While the draft machinery sputtered , enlistments spurted . One reason why recruiting offices were crowded : volunteers get their choice of Army , Air Force or Navy ; draftees do not .                    @
