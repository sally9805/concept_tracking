World Middleweight Champion Sugar Ray Robinson had fought six fights in six weeks , gadded about Paris and made innumerable personal appearances ( TIME , June ii et seq . ) . His wife Edna Mae was uneasy about him : " Sugar 's tired . He 's overtrained and overfought . " Meanwhile , Britain 's Middleweight Champion Randy Turpin , on the eve of the fight of his life , made a soberly restrained prediction : " I think I have a chance . " Nevertheless , the odds were 3-1-on Sugar Ray when the men climbed into the ring at Earl 's Court in London last week . <P> Turpin crowded the champion from the opening bell , getting the better of the infighting , jabbing and hooking to keep Robinson constantly off balance . Not until Round Three did Robinson land a solid punch , a bolo left to the jaw . " Get him , Sugar ! Get him , Sugar ! " shrilled Edna Mae . But 31-year-old Sugar Ray could not get going . His timing was off , his punches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rhythm . In a seventh-round clinch , Turpin butted an ugly gash over Robinson 's left eye . At the sight of blood , the crowd sensed an upset and howled for it . Edna Mae changed her line . " You can do it , Sugar ! You can do it ! " <P> Disappearing Dynamite . Sugar tried . <P> In Rounds Nine and Eleven he banged Turpin around , but there was no stopping power in the punches . Muttered a British sportwriter : " I still have n't seen any of that dynamite I 've been writing about . " By Round Twelve , it was obvious that only a lucky knockout punch could save Robinson 's title . Cried Edna Mae : " Hold on , Sugar ! Hold on ! " By Round 15 , Turpin was pummeling the tired champion almost at will . " Do n't let him hit you ! " screamed Edna Mae . " Take care of yourself ! " The uproarious crowd began chanting " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow " before the referee even raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champ who had lost only once before* in 126 professional fights . <P> The British press , glumly conditioned to watching U.S. boxers flatten Britain 's best , crowed with delight . Bragged the Daily Mirror : " Turpin became world champion without any of the hokum that Americans have used to bedazzle and bamboozle their opponents before the fight . " London 's anti-American , middlebrow New Statesman and Nation felt a primitive thrill : " The local boy from Leamington Spa became the giant-killer and we all felt bigger and better in consequence . . . Europe had risen from the gutter and thrashed the Prince of the Dollar Empire ... Morale rises ... Even the Government becomes our Government and can be sure of re-election on such a morning after . " <P> The Daily Mirror 's " hokum " crack was a reference to Robinson 's training quarters at Windsor 's Star and Garter Hotel , where thousands of curious Britons , acting for all the world like U.S. bobby-soxers , craned and crowded for a glimpse of Robinson and his flamboyant 14-man entourage or a peek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , son of a British Guianan and a white British mother , trained in the placid remoteness of Grwych Castle in North Wales .
