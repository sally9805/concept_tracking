When Bell Telephone Laboratories announced its silicon solar battery ( TIME , May 3 , 1954 ) , it fired the imaginations of the science fictionists , and the solar system was soon abuzz with solar-powered space ships . Trimming their silicon sails to catch the sunlight , spacemen used the electricity generated by the batteries to push themselves from planet to planet . <P> More practical imaginations were fired too . Last week National Fabricated Products Inc. , a Chicago electronics manufacturer , announced that it has had more than 500 inquiries about the silicon batteries which it has just started making commercially under license from Bell Lab 's parent company . Western Electric . Inquiries have come from industrial labora tories all over the world , including India . <P> Most customers ask for a dozen or so ( $25 each ) , and seldom say what they hope to use them for . <P> N.F.P. 's version of the battery is a thin , blackish wafer about the size of a half dollar , enclosed in protective glass . It has two electric terminals like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bright sunlight it generates about half a volt . A square yard of the batteries would light a 100-watt lamp or run an electric fan . A few acres would give enough power for a fair-sized town . <P> Large-scale uses are unlikely until the price comes down . The batteries are ex pensive because they are made of highly purified silicon ( $280 per lb. ) , which must be " grown " by a tricky process into a single crystal about the size of a fat banana . The wafers are cross sections one-fiftieth of an inch thick , and they must go through a subtle chemical treatment be fore they will work as batteries . <P> While the cost remains high , the chief practical uses will be to supply minute amounts of current for relays , electronic instruments or small radio transmitters . <P> Bell Labs , looking ahead , is experimenting with them for charging the storage batteries of rural tele ' hone lines . Frames of them set on poles at Americus , Ga . are performing well , but Bell is worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Maurice E. Paradise , of Na tional Fabricated Products , is sure that the solar batteries can be made much more cheaply . He hopes that eventually the magic silicon can be sprayed on a sur face as a crystalline metallic varnish . Then really big batteries will be cheap . They are rugged and last practically forever . A house roofed with sun-absorbing silicon could generate all the current it needs whenever the sun is shining .
