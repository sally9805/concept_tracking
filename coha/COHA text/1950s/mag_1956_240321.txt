As they echoed around the world last week , two of the season 's most quoted Christmas messages came through clearer than they had in the original . <P> In his Christmas greeting to the world , Pope Pius XII proposed a three-point disarmament plan , composed of : 1 ) banning nuclear tests , 2 ) renouncing the use of nuclear weapons , and 3 ) establishing an armament control system . After running the Pope 's proposals through the propaganda mill , the Communist press exploited the first two points , which the Soviet Union favors , and ignored the third , which the U.S. considers essential . ( Part of the U.S. press , by failing to read carefully the Pope 's intricate prose , distorted his message almost as much as did the Communists . ) Last week , the Voice of America acclaimed the Pope 's plan and denounced the Communists for twisting it . The point hammered home by the Voice : Pope Pius clearly linked all three of his proposals , did not advance them separately . That put him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weapons is useless unless there is effective international control . <P> Also echoing and re-echoing was President Eisenhower 's Christmas message to the nations behind the Iron Curtain , in which he said : " The American people recognize the trials under which you are suffering . . . and share your faith that right in the end will prevail to bring you once again among the free nations of the world . " In Moscow , Communist Boss Nikita Khrushchev roared that the message violated the " Spirit of Geneva , " was " crude interference " in the affairs of other nations ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . <P> In reply to Khrushchev , the White House pointedly repeated its Christmas wish of liberty to the Soviet Union 's satellites . After talking with the President and the Secretary of State , Presidential News Secretary James Hagerty said : " It was made abundantly clear at Geneva to the Soviet rulers that the ' Spirit of Geneva ' could not and did not involve any relaxing of the peaceful purpose of the United States to achieve liberty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The peaceful liberation of the captive peoples has been , is , and , until success is achieved , will continue to be a major goal of United States foreign policy . "
