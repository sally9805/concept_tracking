WISE BLOOD ( 232 pp. ) - Flannery O'Connor-Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> THE FAMILY ( 379 pp. ) - Caroline Ivey - William Sloane ( $3.50 ) . <P> Seasons come , seasons go . but Southern novels just keep rolling along . Here are two new ones , both by women , and as different in subject and style as two books could be . Flannery O'Connor 's arty Wise Blood flashes with fitful satire ; Caroline Ivey 's The Family gleams with kitchen coziness . One is too far from humanity , the other a bit too close to it . <P> The hero of Flannery O'Connor 's Wise Blood , a red-neck fanatic who plans to create " the Church Without Christ , " is one of the most unlikely dullards ever to grumble through an American novel . The grandson of a fundamentalist preacher who was always harping on hell . Haze Motes feels that if he could abolish the idea of Jesus , there would be no need to worry about sin . Shouting from the hood of his dilapidated Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing to fall from and no Redemption because there was no Fall . . . Nothing matters but that Jesus was a liar . " <P> As he rasps out his gospel . Motes encounters a series of characters even more bizarre than himself . There is Sabbath Lily Hawks , an adolescent degenerate who takes Motes as a temporary lover . Sabbath 's daddy , a fake blind man , is one of Motes 's competitors in street preaching ; another is Onnie Jay Holy , whose religious interest runs mainly to the collection plate . Motes 's career comes to a gruesome end when he deliberately blinds himself because a mean-spirited cop has pushed his unlicensed Essex over a cliff . <P> Wise Blood commands attention for its oddness , and for its occasional passages of crisp writing and sly humor . But all too often it reads as if Kafka had been set to writing the continuity for L'il Abner . <P> By contrast , Caroline Ivey 's The Family is reassuring in its pedestrian normality . Novelist Ivey has turned to that familiar Southern fixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olmstead household comes a Northern son-in-law , brilliant , restless and unhappy . Though he loves his wife , he can not fit into her family or persuade her to break away from it . Why should they always be kissing and hugging , reminiscing about adolescent trivia , delighting in the vast disorder of their house , and still honoring the obsolete cult of the Southern Lady ? Most of The Family is a quarrel-by-quarrel account of a North-South marriage ; the rest is a sympathetic picture of the gallant but slipping Olmsteads . As a study in regional contrasts , Author Ivey 's book is persuasive ; but it is too long and slow , and its main theme need not have been worried quite so much .
