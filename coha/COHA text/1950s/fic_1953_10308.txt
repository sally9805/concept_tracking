" Shocking ! " said the Countess . " I wonder if I can act such a part . " " She is much attracted , " the playwright went on , " by a gentlemansummering in the neighborhood , a certain Count Roberto , who calls on her as a matter of civility and invites her to view his gardens . Ile is a man of excellent manners and conduct , who , though not indifferent to the charms of Donna Florida , is honorably aware of her betrothal to Don Flavio and refrains from paying her any other addresses than good breeding demands . " " Something of a stick , " remarked the Countess . " Madonna , perhaps . But he is the gentleman of good sense who inspires the title of the play . It is a role that demands experienced acting to avoid flatness . I have therefore selected Sior Morandi for that part . " Maria Sagredo burst out laughing . " Cospetto ! So the fiddler 's promoted to count , is he ? Good God ! Suppose , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kick in the breech ! " Richard sat quivering . The rush of blood to his head turned him dizzy . Again , as last night , he was helpless . Sagredo had intended no insult , only humor . One ca n't speak of insulting a dog by kicking it . Such a remark , from such a grandee , would be swallowed with a grin by most of the poor comedians iaa Venice . It was meant to be swallowed that way now . Sagredo could not he blamed for Richard'ssensitiveness . In the circumstances , however , he could be blamed for indelicacy , and no one smiled . The Countess , indeed , made a little grimace and studied the polish on her fingernails . Troinha took snuff . FortunatelyRichard could see at once that his best retort was silence . Aware of the chill , Sagredo glanced in surprise from one to the other . TTis grin faded . He coughed ; then . tilting nap his chin and patronizing as ever , asked Goldoni , " Well , Sior Carlo. what next ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught him meekness . He cleared his throat . " Ah , yes , as I was saying , Conant Roberto treats Donna Florida with civility but does not respond to her flattering sentiments for him . He is tmble , however , to escape the jealousy of Don Claudio  --  " Goldoni smiled at Tromba  --  " who , aware of the lady 's preference , is skeptical of the Count 's honorablerestraint . And at this point the valiant soldier , Donna Florida 's betrothed , returns unexpectedly from the wars . It is unfortunate40that the first person he encounters is the jealous and unscrupulous Claudio.  --  I regret , Cavaliere , " the playwright added , " that you should be the villain of the piece . But it is a role susceptible of excellentand even sympathetic acting . " Tromba nodded . " I 've glanced through it , Signor Dottore . Excusesare unnecessary . Have you ever remarked that in life , as on the stage , the villain is apt to be more interesting than the hero  --  " his eyes rested on Sagredo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies ? Pray continue . I take it that the soldierly Don Flavio is richer in courage than in brains , quicker to fight than to think , and is , therefore , a victim of my wiles  --  I mean Don Claudio 's . " " Sior , yes , " said Goldoni . " The Very Noble Flavio believes that valor is everything and that the sword removes any obstacle . He is jealous , choleric and headlong  --  " " Wait a moment , " interrupted Sagredo. "  --  but he is a man , " Goldoni persisted , " of the highest distinction , of the most manly qualities , devoted to the Lady Florida and beloved by her , in spite of Count Roberto 's temporary attraction . He is the romantic hero of the play . " " Ah , " Sagredo approved . " Well ? " " Your Excellence shall hear . " Goldoni rapidly sketched the plot . Claudio-Tromba , intent on winning the lady by any means , accuses her of inconstancy and , in the guise of a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ignorant , to subject her to a test . Flavio will write her a letter announcing his early arrival but describing an ugly disfigurementwhich he is supposed to have received in battle . Naturally , however , he can not imagine that such a disfigurement would affect her love for him , and he remains hers devotedly . He would see , Claudio warned , that her loyalty was not proof against such news and Count Roberto 's blandishments . The letter is written and presented to Donna Florida . " What , Contessina , " asked Goldoni playfully , " would have been your response ? Remember you are betrothed to him . " Amelie 's eyes widened . " Affe di Dio , the question surprises me . What on earth could I do with such an ugly man ? It would distress me even to look at him . I should send him packing at once . " " Good ! " Tromba laughed. 41 " Traitress ! " scowled Sagredo . " There you are , " Goldoni chuckled . " You see how perfectly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same view of it as the Countess des Landes ; Claudio is delighted , and Flavio enraged . You can now very well imagine how the play proceeds . Don Flavio dis- closes himself undisfigured to the lady and denounces her perfidy . He seeks a duel with Count Roberto , who , however , persuades him of his innocence . He actually fights with Claudio , whose treachery he discovers , and but for an accident would have killed him . He again becomes jealous of Roberto . Donna Florida , meanwhile , ac- cuses him of ungentlemanly and unloverlike conduct in writing her the false letter and offers her hand to Roberto . Everyone is at loggerheads . The kettle boils . It is Count Roberto whose tact and good sense provide the solution . " " What solution ? " Sagredo grunted . " She marries the fiddler Count , eh ? In that case , by God  --  " " Not at all , Lustrissimo . Your Excellence and the lady are me- onciled , are married . Your future happiness is assured . " " Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . That 's as it should be . A very good play , Sior Carlo . My congratulations . " " I thank Your Excellence . " The irony in Goldoni 's voice was too faint for the other 's ears . " There remains , then , only to distribute the parts . Here they are . .. yours . . . and yours . . . and yours . Captain Beccaria , the role of Gandolfo , the lady 's factor , can be very entertaining . Sior Brunetti , I regret that the part of Merlino , the servant , offers little scope for your talents . You are most obliging to favor us . Shall we say tomorrow , then , at this hour , for rehearsal ? " " And , mark you , Marin , " said the Countess , " if you 're to be my lover , you must learn your lines . " " Oh , Ill learn them well enough , " Sagredo promised . " We 'll have a prompter , of course ? " " I 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in order . " Sagredo offered his arm to the Countess . " Will you not relent , madama ? Will you not allow me to escort your chaise to the Villa Pisani ? Remember , this Claudio here is a great rogue . " She shook her head . " But you can escort me as far as my room , caro . I must hurry now to change . " 42 With the lady on his arm , Sagredo happened to pass Richard and stopped a moment to laugh . " Count Roberto , your servant , sir . Do n't look so glum . Madonna , how are you going to fall in love with a face like that ? I ca n't understandGoldoni . But , yes , I do . It 'll be a comedy in itself to watch the dog acting a nobleman . So , pluck up your spirits , Count . Learn to smile . And take a tip from me . On the night of the play , use perfume . Use plenty of it . Ha ? That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ribs with the knob of his riding whip and sauntered on , unconscious of the shadow of murder behind him . With the exception of Goldoni and Tromba , the others followed . The Doctor laid a hand on Richard 's shoulder . " I 'm sorry , boy . I should n't have got you into this . But it was well intended . You see , I 'd never met him before . He 's a most insufferable young beast . If you choose to withdraw , I could n't blame you . Ill ask Captain Beccaria to take your role . " " No , Sior Dottore  --  " the smile which Sagredo had invited now appeared , but it had a hooked edge  --  " I 'll not sneak off . We 'll see what happens . " " You 'll do nothing foolish , Milor . " Goldoni forced a laugh . " Remember , you 're the Gentleman of Good Sense . " Richard nodded . He was too angry even to hint at what he had in mind , though his thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast with the hot silence , Tromba 's voice , when he spoke , sounded cool . His reckless black eyes were probing Richard . " That 's right , young man . Nothing foolish . And you show good spirit in sticking by the play . But I know what you 're thinking . There 's just so much that human flesh and blood can stand , eh ? The damned fellow will go one step too far , and then  --  Aha , vendetta ! I know . There 's nothing sweeter . Not even a woman . While it lasts . But listen . " Tromba , who had rolled the manuscript of his part into a cylinder , drew it back and forth between his hands . The diamonds of a blue-enameled marquise ring glittered . " Revenge is a pleasure that ought to be spun out . Slip your knife into Sagredo ? Well , you 've had a moment 's satisfaction . He's43buried with honor ; you 're broken on the wheel . What 's the point ? Call that vendetta ? Not to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watch him squirm , make a butt of him , enjoy yourself . And you can do just that in this play , if you use your head . Give me a share in it . Between us , we 'll turn out something elegant , something in good style . Do you agree ? " " But , gentlemen , " put in Goldoni , " I beg . Consider my credit if offense is given to his heart . " Maestro , i solemnly promise that your play will have every success , that your credit will not suffer , and that Count Widiman will be delighted . Only trust me . Well , Signor Morandi , shall we join forces in the art of vendetta ? " " I 'm not sure , " said Richard , " that I know what Your Signory means . " Tromba smiled . " Oh , we 'll put our heads together . Well improvise . T think we can serve up a very neat dish . And , by the way , you must let me supply Count Roberto ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and 1 are about the same height . " " But , Zelenza  --  " Richard flushed . " Also , " continued the other , " T beg you will share my room . That 's important . If we 're to collaborate in this , we must be together . We must exchange ideas . There might be some points I could suggest in regard to your role . You see . I 've probably had more experience of people like Count- Roberto than you have " No more roasting at night in the mansard . But especially this opportunity of association with a great fashionable like Tromba . Richard could hardly believe his ears . " Would Count Widiman consent ? " " I 'll arrange it . " " But will your Excellence at least tell me to what I owe your protection , your favor . . . ? " " Most certainly , my dear boy . " Tromba turned to Goldoni . " I promised our good friend the Doctor here that I would be glad to render you any service I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  No , it 's the truth , caro Miliu , if i may call you so .  --  Besides , believe it or not , I 'm superstitious . I have a feeling thatour stars may have drawn us together for our common benefit . " Tromba had a far-off look in his eyes , but it was doubtful that they had in view any star more distant than the one in diamonds on Lord Marny 's coat . " Then , too , " he added , " one of my hobbies is cutting cocks ' combs . " He thrust the roll of paper into his pocket . " Well , I must be off to escort the Countess . " And with a laugh : " Talk of improvising ! I rather believe that she can be persuaded to give a little spice to our dish . " VION the night of the play , Richard stood wondering at the reflectionof himself in the long mirror set up on Tromba 's toilet table . Or was it himself ? He had passed through the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no longer bunched on the nape of his neck , was curled , pomaded , and powdered in the form of a wig . He wore a Parisian suit : rose and gold coat , beautifullyflowered waistcoat , dark breeches with glittering knee buckles , lace at the throat and wrists , diamond studs in the waistcoat . He wore , too , the appropriate shoes , stockings , laced hat , and court sword  --  even fobs and a blazing finger ring . Fashionable heels added an inch to his height . He smelled of attar of roses . Only the face seemed vaguely familiar ; but it , too , had changed from swarthy to white , with a patch on one cheek to bring out the pallor . His eyebrows had been trimmed into black arches . What with his big nose , mouth , and cheekbones , the result was striking . And , already in his role , he felt an inner change to match the clothes . He felt elevated , magnificent , and assured . Wait till Maritza Venier saw him in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the play . He had talked with her briefly a couple of times since their parting at the sundial , and she had seemed a little reserved . But wait till tonight ! .. . Meanwhile , lorgnette in hand , Tromba was eying him from differentangles . " Good ! " he approved finally . " You turn out as I expected . Interesting , a face to remember , a touch of the devil . That 's what takes an audience . Well , Milor , I congratulate you and a little myself . " " A little ! Good Lord ! " said Richard . " If I carry this off tonight , your Signory knows that it 'll be entirely owing to you . " Indeed , glancing back over the past four days , he could not expresshis thanks . Tromba 's kindness was a perpetual amazement . The Cavaliere had not only shared his room and now his wardrobe with Richard ; but he had treated him as a young disciple , discussing fine points of behavior and manners helpful to the role of Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enlighteninghis ignorance of the world with precepts drawn from a very crowded experience . If most of these were cynical and rather wicked , they were nevertheless piquant . They smacked of the cosmopolitan beau monde . They had the attraction of new and exotic ideas . " My dear boy , " Tromba said once , " if you will only concentrate on one thought , one thought alone , until YOU have mastered it , you 'll be in a fair way of making the world your oyster . And that 's the ruling purpose of every intelligent man . " " What thought , your Excellence ? " " Simply this . To consider anything or any person a humbug until they prove otherwise . And they seldom do . For instance  --  leaving aside such commonplace frauds as virtue , piety , and that sort of thing , which no one , in private at least , takes too seriously  --  you 've spoken once or twice of a gulf between the classes that prevents you from rising in the world . What a humbug that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep and of the shepherds bent on fleecing them . To a man of pluck , it does n't exist at all . Classes ? There are only two : the dupers and the duped . If you take a right view of humbug , you wo n't be among the latter . " However encouraging this was to Richard 's ambitions , he could not accept the main thought . " But , Sior Cavaliere , I know plenty of honest people . " " All , do you ? Well , there 's no harm in believing them honest , provided it does n't cost you too much . " " Dr. Goldoni , for instance . " Tromba laughed . " Now , now ! You ca n't tempt me into personalities . I was speaking as a philosopher  --  and in confidence  --  for46your benefit . Of course , a man of the world should rarely say what he thinks . I hope you appreciate the exception I 'm making in your case . " Now , recalling such talks , Richard could not have helped valuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least his cordiality . To be treated as a younger equal and to be favored with the advice of so brilliant a man was a very special honor . It was like being introduced to an exclusive club which he had so far only dreamed of entering . And , after all , upsetting as they were , perhaps more of Tromba 's maxims took root in his mind than he supposed . They gave one a sense of superiority to humdrum good people . They were like a fine , rather heady perfume . But , of course , more impressive than Tromba 's teaching was the man himself . He had nothing effeminate or feeble about him . His hard inner core lay close under the veneer . He did not have to swagger about his manhood or hint that he could be a dangerous enemy . The masculine qualities of physical strength and dare were somehow apparent even when he was at his most suave and courtly . A young man like Richard , boiling with life , could not help admiring them . " I hope , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Excellenceknows how grateful I am . " Folding the lorgnette , Tromba replaced it in his waistcoat pocket . " You confuse me . I never do anything for nothing . As a man of pleasure , I always have pleasure in view . Varied in this case . Our feud with Sagredo , for one thing . By God , is n't it worth some trouble to bait that bull ? I do n't believe he 'll forget tonight . But that 's not all of it . There 's a pleasure in training people along one 's own line . Take a fencing master ; he enjoys working with pupils of talent , pointing out this trick or that , polishing their style . Well , my line is action , affairs ; in short , the world . And you have talent . Yes , you have considerable talent . No simpleton could act the role of Count Roberto as I believe you will . And if that role , then others more profitable and distinguished . I believe you 're cut out for big things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tromba hesitated ; but perhaps on the point of something more definite , he said merely : " Who knows , someday I might be asking you for a service in return . " 47 " It would be a happy day for me , Zelenza . " " Would it , my friend ?  --  Meanwhile , I 'm thinking that your costumeneeds the ribbon of an order , as a last touch . I do n't believe that Sagredo has been decorated . Let 's see . What shade ? Lavender perhaps . " Walking over to one of his traveling bags , Tromba drew out a small coffer , which he unlocked , then poured its contents on a table . Richard saw a heap of jeweled stars , crosses and other heraldic shapes in a tangle of ribbons . " Capperi ! Ilas your Excellence all those orders ? " " Obviously , since they 're here . Nothing sets off a costume better . I vary ' em to suit my clothes . Then , too , they build up a man 's prestige . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure in gems , are n't you afraid of thieves ? " Tromba looked amused . " Lord , no . Thieves are n't so easily hoaxed as people of fashion . The jewels are only paste  --  like the ones you 're wearing . Naturally , you 'll keep this to yourself . " " Paste ? " A little startled , Richard glanced at the great diamond of his ring , at his studs and buckles . " Of course , " smiled Tromba . " From the ' Hirano glassworks . Do you think I 'm Croesus ? But do n't worry . ' I'hev'rc good paste  --  a lot better than some that 's being worn here tonight . And what of it , as long as they glitter ? That 's the main point . Think it over , my boy ; it applies to most things .  --  All , ecco , here 's what we want . " He selected a broad lavender ribbon , which he slipped over Richard'shead and under his collar to form a contrast with the flowered satin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center completed the decoration on the left side of the coat . " There you are . Effective , eh ? " Eyeing the mirror again , Richard noted how the addition gave depth and splendor to the costume , worthy of Count Roberto 's rank . " May I ask your Signory what order that is ? " Tromba wrinkled his forehead . " I have so many . . . sometimes I confuse them . I believe this one is the Royal Order of the Lilac . It was conferred on me by the Shah of Persia in Baghdad , if that'swhere he lives . Yes , Baghdad will do . But now "  --  he consulted his watch  --  " we 'd better be showing up backstage . A little nervous ? " Richard nodded . " A little . Not too much . " " That 's right . A little wo n't hurt . Puts a man on his mettle . But you need n't worry . Madame des Landes will do her part . If you do n't pay off Sagredo with interest tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me yet . " By now , the score against Sagredo had tripled . Richard flamed at the thought of yesterday 's rehearsal . The bullying and ridicule would have been past bearing except for Tromba 's steadying eye and the Countess des Landes 's smiling encouragement . His submissionbaited the trap into which Sagredo was being led . For the scheme which had been worked out between Richard and Tromba , in alliance with the Countess , was a comedy within a comedy , a practical joke which would not be sprung till the play was actually given and too late for the young patrician to avoid it . So , at the rehearsals , Richard , in his usual drab clothes , had acted Count Roberto 's part with more skill than anyone but his fellow conspiratorsknew . To Goldoni 's despair and Sagredo 's scorn , he had given a perfect imitation of the clodhopper aping a nobleman . Rumor , fanned by Sagredo , spread through the villa that , if there was nothing else to laugh at in The Gentleman of Good Sense , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , Richard ! " stormed Goldoni after the last rehearsal . " The thing 's a nightmare . I praised you to the skies ; I gave you the best puff I could ; but here you are as if you had never acted in your life . You seem bewitched . You shuffle your feet , mouth your words , scratch your head . Have you no spirit or pride ? Oh , Lord ! And Tromba , on whom I really depended shows no more feeling for his part than a post . Sagredo has n't learned his lines . The Contessa acts well , but she 's helpless by herself . I wish to heaven that Count Widiman had never asked for the play . I 've about resolved to tell him  --  " " No , Sior Dottore , " Richard begged . " The Cavaliere and I have profited from your comments . I believe you 'll see a different performancefrom the rehearsal . At least I promise not to shuffle or scratch . " Struck by something in Richard 's face , Goldoni challenged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , Sior Dottore , not yours . I 'm sure you 'll like the play . Do n't be concerned . " " I only wish it were over , " gloomed the other . Having let themselves out through a side door of the villa , Tromba and Richard , with long cloaks over their cost runes , walked around through the garden to the stage entrance of the theater . Tromba exchanged greetings with several groups of guests , who were strolling about after supper , waiting for the hour of the play . A murmur followed them . Richard overheard : " Who is that other gentleman ? "  --  " Do n't know , " was the answer . " Never saw him . " It promised well . Tromba chuckled . " There are some famous gossips here tonight . If Sagredo comes a cropper , they 'll spread the news .  --  Well , here we are . " He paused with a hand on the latch of the stage door . " Evviva la vendetta ! " VIITHE long , rococo salon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Widiman and its frescoed walls bright with " The Rape of Helen " and " The Sacrifice of Iphigenia " in the manner of Tiepolo , contained that evening some hundred and fifty guests . Neighboring villas up and down the Brenta had furnished their quotas of people curious to see the latest Goldoni play . Besides , the Countess des Landes was well known and popular ; Marin Sagredo topped the list of beaux ; and everybody had met or heard of the accomplished Cavaliere from Naples , who had establishedhimself so promptly in Brenta society . Under the glitter of the chandeliers , the room , like a jeweled parterre , showed every blending of color . The babble of voices grew momently louder . In the warm summer evening , the air thickened with a steam of perfume kept in motion by the incessantfluttering of fans . People bowed , waved , chatted , with the overtone of vivacity which precedes the opening of a play , and50glanced at the still-drawn curtains of the stage . The elite of social Venice were there , all dilletantes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused , but quick to satirize . A difficult audience . Carlo Goldoni , eying the assembly through a peephole in the curtain , felt more nervous than ever . He could expect no good from this evening . The orchestra in their balcony struck up a light air from one of Pergolesi 's burlettas . Attendants began snuffing the candles to enhance the lighting of the stage . The surge of voices ebbed toward silence . With a heavy heart , Goldoni gave a signal for drawing the curtains and stepped down into the prompter 's box . Though invisible , he seemed to himself in a pillory . The heavy draperies behind him swung apart . They disclosed the typical salon of a country villa . The factor , Gandolfo , and Don Claudio-Tromba were discovered conversing . The play had begun . But at the first lines spoken by Tromba , Goldoni felt agreeably startled . There was no trace of the lifeless singsong which had dismayedhim at the rehearsal . The voice was warm , modulated , and distinct , the kind of voice , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Martellian couplets , which could be so flat on the lips of an untrained actor , were properly varied with the right cesuras to sound like prose that only occasionally sparkled into rhyme . Excellent ! And the voice was the least of it . Tromba had all the arts of gesture and glance which make words dramatic . He had , too , the gift of establishing a sort of confidential relationship with the spectators , of enlisting their favor ; in other words , a delightful stage presence . " Perbacco ! " thought Goldoni . " If that man has n't belonged to some good troupe , I 've never seen an actor . " To be sure , as a villain , he was too winning . Insensibly the comedy drifted off at an unintended angle . But what of that ? Tuned to the vibrations of an audience , Goldoni could tell that this one was fascinated . And , if so , nothing else mattered . In the following scenes between Claudio-Tromba and the Countess des Landes as Florida , he became even more aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heroine , who rejectedhim in favor of the absent soldier ; but the declaration would51have melted a statue , and the rejection sounded like consent . The words were the same that Goldoni had written , but their implicationwas entirely different . The plot drifted further off line . The actors seemed to be recomposing the play . There had been nothing like this at the rehearsals . Completely absorbed , Goldoni forgot to turn the pages of his script to keep up with the dialogue ; and , when the scene ended , he realized with a start that he had not had to prompt once . He felt an amazed relief . So far , magnificent . Incomparably better than at Zola . Now , if Richard could only act his part as well as the others , the evening would be a success . But with the rehearsals in mind , Goldoni , though encouraged , hardly dared let himself hope . The one actor whom he had sponsored as a professional necessary to the chief role of the play seemed utterly outclassed by these amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innounce his masterto Donna Florida , Goldoni braced himmselI . The first impression was apt to be decisive . And Count Roberto appeared . Until that moment , the Doctor had not seen Iichard 's splendid costume , which had been hidden under the long cloak . He knew only that some clothes had been borrowed from ' I'roniha . Now his surprise echoed the admiring murmur of the audience . If Richard had hardly recognized himself , Goldoni at first ( lid not recognize him at all and half imagined that someone else had taken the role . Moreover , the Count 's bearing suited his dress . The sharp critics of the audience would be quick to note the least awkwardnessand quick to smile at a goose in fine feathers . But they de . tected no flaws ; on the contrary , they found the newly entered player convincing . It was not that he acted a noblemnan well , but that , by a trick of art , the audience momentarily did not think of him as acting at all . He was a Count Roberto ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His personality somehow introduced a note of mystery , suspense , and dramatic conflict . At this point , more than ever , when he had adjusted himself in delighted relief to Richard 's appearance , Goldoni grew aware of what was happening to his play . As he had written it , the part of Count Roberto portrayed a sensible , virtuous , well-balanced man in contrast to the coquettish Florida , the scheming Claudio , and the52hot-tempered soldier , Don Flavio . Only good acting could prevent it from becoming smug and a little dull . But now , though not a word of the text was changed , all the implications had been altered . Roberto threatened to become Count Robert the Devil . His honorable sentiments conveyed an undertone of passion and menace , a hint , too , of conflict within himself . Like a splendid serpent , he held the fluttering little coquette in the coils of his personality . As compared with him , the official villain , ClaudioTromba , seemed commonplace . And when the act ended with Donna Florida accompanying the Count to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Imagination escorted them . Many a belle dreamily fanned her hot cheeks ; many a beau thoughtfully took snuff . Then came the applause . " Canchero ! " muttered Goldoni . He felt in a dream . This was his play , and yet it was not his play . He did not know how it would turn out . He had become a curious spectator as much as anyone in the audience . It chagrined him a little , however , to realize how much better this dream version was than the plot he had intended , more exciting , profounder . A great success  --  there could be no doubt of that  --  and ironically enough he would receive the credit for it . But what was going to happen ? Why had the actors run off with the play ? Distractedly he turned over the pages of his unused prompter 's script to the beginning of the second act , which followed without intermission . Then , as Don Flavio-Sagredo entered , the web which had been so subtly spun for him by the others began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deadlier . So that was it ! Goldoni sat on pins and needles , watching each new turn . He was torn between admiration for the artistry used on the victim and dread of the consequences . It was the pillory by ridicule . But supposeSagredo held Goldoni accountable ! If the comedy had been given as its author intended , the contrastbetween Sagredo 's clumsy performance and the polished acting of the others would have been funny enough . From the rehearsals , Sagredo could not have foreseen that the loutish Richard and the singsong Tromba would be so transformed on the stage as to mimake him ridiculous . But at least he knew how the play was sup-53posed to go . Now , bewilderingly , the whole plot seemed to have changed , though the lines were the same . His fellow actors said one thing and apparently meant another . He could only stumble on at a loss with what he had half learned , acting his part in ignorance of what the others were about . As a result , instead of the handsome , hot-tempered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as the play went on , a buffoon . Whatever he did , peoplelaughed . If he had been flexible , he might have made the most of this and accepted it in good part . But he showed his confusion so clearly as to make it obvious that he did not expect to be laughed at . And the laughter became personal . If lie sulked , the audience tittered ; if he glared , it roared . The idea that a joke of some sort was in progress began to dawn ; and , as a crowd is usually on the side of the jokers , a good many of the spectators joined in . Then too , Sagredo 's arrogance had made enemies , who could 1II1W anonymously pay off their grudge . Of course the fact that the young grandee had taken no troubleto Iearn his lines added to the comedv . I le was constantly signalingfor help from the prompter , the signal being a twitch of the fingers of the left hand , which xvonld have been imperceptible a few times but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind his back , the wits of Venice would tag hire Nvitle that movement front then on . In short , Sagredo found himself helpless . Ile u ; cs n.sed to direct actionbut had no opening for it here . Ile could not browbeat the audience . He could not vent his rage on the other actors , who kept a perfectly straight face , spoke only their Iiues , and did not seem aware that he had any cause for rage . Baffled by Richard 's transformation in costume and manner , he coulel not bully him as he had at the rehearsals . His one or two attempts of the sort fell so flat before Count Roberto 's urbanity and brought such guffaws from the audience that he dared not repeat them . Ile could not throw over his role and refuse to act without thereby admitting his failure and making himself still more ridiculous . Ile was pinned to his role by the public opinion of the social world , which he did not have the courage to defy . Burt , as the play went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheated by Tromba , patronized by the fiddler Count  --  his temperature rose to the boiling point . And when , in the fourth act , the plot called for sword thrusts between him and Tromba , he suddenly decided to turn the tables . Here was a scene where he did not need a prompter , did not need to act , and could be himself . According to the stage directions Claudio-Tromba and FlavioSagredowere to draw their swords and exchange a few passes . Then Sagredo , stepping back to avoid his opponent 's lunge , would stumbleagainst a chair and fall , leaving himself exposed to his enemy . But Donna Florida , entering in time , would grasp Claudio 's arm and thus save the soldier 's life . It was a spirited little scene which could be made exciting enough . It offered the fuming Sagredo a chance he ached for . Only he did not intend to stumble or fall . If Tromba got hurt in the bout , so much the worse for him . Sagredo could not help an accident . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep murder out of his eyes , and that the first engagement of steel felt too much like the real thing to be trifled with . " Keep cool , your Excellence , " Tromba hissed . But Sagredo 's only answer was a tightening of the lips as he heat , feinted and then thrust . In his prompter 's box , Goldoni sat frozen . The audience , fascinated , held their breaths . If this was n't an actual fight , it had all the appearances of one . Sagredo took pride in his swordsmanship , but he soon found that he had met his superior . Indeed , more than once Tromba 's blade slipped past his guard but was not driven home . " Keep it up , Illustrissimo , " the Neapolitan whispered , as they closed at one point hilt to hilt , " keep it up . You 're giving a fine exhibition . Do that little enlacement of yours again , only slower so the people can see it . " And Sagredo , defeated , had sense enough to force a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could at least save face by pretending that he had never had such an intention . But he was short of breath and drew back . The other followed . " Not tired , I hope ?  --  Well , then , it 's time your Excellence tripped over that chair . " Unpalatable as this was , Sagredo could see that it offered him the only dignified escape before his inferiority to Tromba became apparent . Renewing the fight with a great show of spirit , he circled around to the chair , stumbled , and fell . The episode was intended to be exciting , not comic ; but he fell too hard , and the audience laughed . " I have you in my power , " Claudio-Tromba recited . Goldoni , not waiting for the signal , prompted : " No gentleman will strike a fallen man , " and Sagredo dutifully growled it out . " Perfido , " shouted Tromba , " hai da morire ! " Donna Florida des Landes , sweeping in , divinely costumed , laid her hand on Tromba 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yoke of the cursed play once more settled down on Sagredo 's neck . He could only struggle forward raging to the end . There remained , however , the final scene , which might partly compensate for his earlier trials . The intention of the play was to show a quick-tempered , honest soldier who spite of his humors remains lovable , and who at last , by the tactful management of Count Roberto , gains the hand of the heroine , to the great satisfaction of the audience . Here , at least , Sagredo could expect a moment of dignity and popularity . But he failed to realize the extent of what had happened . The romantic hero (  --  001 ( 1 no longer be resurrected . Though not a word of the dialogue was changed , though Count Roberto placed Florida 's hand i0 his , though every phrase promised happiness ever afterwards , the bubble burst in Sagredo 's eyes . What were those languishing glances between Roberto and Florida during the entire scene ? With what a diabolical smile the Count delivered his closing sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the curtain fell ? If the two other actors had placed a pair of horns on Sagredo 's head , the implication could not have been clearer . Fool , oaf , cuckold-to-he ! Conventionally addressing the audience in his last couplet , Roberto-Morandi barbed the point : " Will not true love , indeed , us lovers bless ? My lords and ladies , deign to answer  --  Yes ! " or another , and whether distorted or not , the comedy was a triumph . As for Sagredo , he stood speechless , staring at the Countess des Landes and Richard , his fists clenched , his big neck showing red against the white of his cravat . It would be a long time before the humiliation of that night could be lived down . The thousand gossips of Venice would keep it fresh . And as he stared , it was no accident that Tromba entered smiling from the wings to add to his fury . " You , sir , " choked Sagredo , " you and this whoreson  --  " His eyes shifted back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , Marin caro , you were superb . I had no idea you 're such a genius . " " Madam  --  " " Indeed , yes , " said Goldoni , a little apprehensive . " Let me congratulateyour Excellence . " " You piddling comedian  --  " He turned again on Richard . " As for you , fiddler , I have a long memory and a long arm . Think that over . " The applause in the ballroom , which had been deadened momentarilyby the curtains , grew suddenly loud . Turning his head , Sagredo saw that the curtains had been drawn back again and that he stood raging in full view of the audience . Advancing to the front of the stage , Goldoni bowed , then beckonedthe actors to stand beside him . Each in turn received an ovation . But Sagredo was no longer there . Dropping back , the Countess des Landes seemed to be taking someone by the hand , someone invisible , whom she led forward . To this unseen actor , she made a deep curtsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . VIIIFOR the first time in his life , popularity lifted Richard Morandi to The curtains swung to ; the ballroom shook with applause , rang the stars . It was too sudden and excessive not to be bewildering. with bravos , bravissimos and then with calls for Goldoni . One way He could not help feeling dazzled and a little drunk at the recep-56 57lion that greeted him when , drawn along by Goldoni and Tromba , he walked down with them from the stage to mingle with the audience . There were compliments by the dozen  --  but not only compliments . Several gentlemen presented him with their snuffboxes in token of esteem , and one of these was filled with gold pieces . A very lofty lady , who belonged to the great house of Tron and who hated Sagredo , gave Richard her hand to kiss and a jeweled pin of some value . The eminent Francesco Vendraniin , Jupiter of San Luca 's theater , to whom Goldoni at once made a point of introducinghim , spoke handsomely of his merit and promised the longdesiredcontract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women caressed him with their eyes . Ile felt that every hope had been fulfilled at once . He was both a great actor and a man of fashion . It did not occur to him that this kind of thing was like the first uncorking of a champagne bottle , froth and bubbles which are soon over . So , keeping up the role of Count Roberto , he shook hands , exchangedbows and compliments , expressed his thanks in different ways , and flattered himself that no eoimrtier at Versailles could have done better . Meanwhile , with one corner of his mind , he expected that Maritza Venier would be among those who congratulated him and was faintly disappointed that he did not see her . He could have spared twenty of the other ladies for one admiring look from her . But no doubt she was already waiting for him at the sundial , where they had arranged to meet after the play . The idea brought a glow . To meet her there , no longer in his scruubhv clothes but in this costume , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown of the evening . It was like an old fairy tale , with himself as the prince . The crowd in the ballroom had begun thinning . People drifted out for refreshments or for cards or to take the air in the garden . Servants were again lighting the chandeliers and lining up chairs on the sides for the dance which would begin later . In a moment now , he would be able to disappear . But he reckoned without Count Widiman . " My dear young friend , " said the latter , when Richard made his final bows on the point of withdrawing , " you do n't mean to leave58us , I hope ? We demand your company tonight . You will consider yourself as much my guest as anyone here . I know that it will add to the pleasure of all to have Count Roberto among us . " The group of men and women , comprising Goldoni and the other actors , murmured cordially . " You see they will not be denied , " continued Widiman . " Until now , Signor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been unable to express my own appreciation of your acting and my thanks to Dr. Goldoni for selecting you . Please accept this very small evidence of my gratitude . " And waving aside Richard 's attempt to thank him for the plump purse he bestowed , " Pray do not speak of it .  --  Cavaliere , " he added to Tromba , " will you keep this young gentleman under your wing a little longer ? I think you should sponsor him to the company this evening . " " No , per Dio , " put in the Countess des Landes , " I will . You forgetI 'm madly in love with him . We must make the most of time before my husband Don Flavio gets back from the sulks . " And to Richard , " Your arm , Signor Conte . " " What of my arm ? " Tromba protested . " Am I to be Ieft out ? Are we going to start the play all over again ? " " No , " she smiled , " just continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the Countess his arm . It took more savior-faire than his to extricate himself . But , instead of pride at the honor , he felt trapped as he walked with Amelie des Landes and the others down the length of the room and so out among the groups of guests beyond . What of Maritza ? And yet surely she must understand that he had been detained ; she would wait for him a little while . He would be able to break away in a few minutes . But it did not prove easy . There were more people to greet . The Countess desired an ice , a glass of champagne , insisted on his drinkingwith her . And as they drank , her eyes suddenly held his . It was an odd , veiled look , half shy , half bold , piquant as the wine itself . Inevitably , his pulse quickened . She had marvelous expressive eyes , dark blue but in the light of the candles almost black . He had caught that look in them during the play and had considered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blockhead if he had failed to see the personal invitation. 59 " Ah-h ! " she said , lowering her glass . " You can pour me another . I feel in the mood tonight . I intend to be tipsy . No , no , not drunk  --  there 's no fun in that . Superbly tipsy . You know . Drift , feel , burn . Let 's be tipsy together . Fill up your glass , mio ben . " And once more the challenge of her eyes compelled an answer in his . It was typical of her , as it is of some women , that every physical attribute became sensually provocative . IIer shapely fingers around the glass , the curve of her forearm where the lace fell back , the tiny patch on her chin , the insolence of her breasts half revealed , half hidden by the low decolletage , each stirred a man 's blood . In another woman , the same details might have been disregarded . The Countess 's personality gave an electric charge to everythingabout her . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was exciting . She remarked : " Ah , mio signore , do you know that you 're handsome ? Yes , quite handsome .  --  Please ! Sonic more champagne  --  and for you , too . But I must have a macaroon first . Look , we 'll share this one . " She bit the macaroon in two . " open your mouth . There ! " Her finger drew along his lips . " What a pity you do n't speak French ! " He answered by dropping easily into that language . It was the one he used constantly with his mother . " Tiens ! Then you do speak it ? " " Mais oui , madame . " She broke into rapid French and at once changed slightly , becoming , if anything , more vivid . " Now we caul talk . We can extend ourselves . Italian 's musical  --  yes , but sentimental . I hate sentiment . I like clarity even when it 's naughty . Where did you learn French ? " ' He explained , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French too , and my father Irish . And what the devil am I ? And what are you ? And what does it matter ? " She raised her glass . " Shall we drink to the Island of Cythera and a pleasant voyage there ? " A laughing voice put in : " Yes , but not without me , by your leave . There 's a toast and a voyage I wo n't be left out of  --  not with you on the quarterdeck , madame . " Tromha 's hawk face loomed over the little table where they were seated near the buffet . He drew up a chair , poured himself some wine . Although smil-ing , he seemed to Richard a little put out . " Or is three a crowd on that trip ? " he added . " Not at all , " said the Countess . " I 'm sure you 're an excellent sailor , Monsieur le Chevalier . " She clinked glasses with both men and gave both the same glance . But at once Richard felt himself eclipsed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lady 's charms . His brief experience as a man of the world was not up to navigating such waters . And some moments later , when Tromba proposed a game of faro before the dancing started , he again tried to excuse himself . The tall porcelain clock in one corner of the dining room showed that at least three quarters of an hour had passed since the close of the play . He hardly dared hope that Maritza would have waited so long for him . But at least , if he hurried now to the appointed place , he would have done his best . " And so , with your permission , madame  --  " " My permission , nothing ! I need you to bring me luck . This is your lucky night , Monsieur le Comte . I require your attendance , unless  --  Ah , I see . " She drew an obvious conclusion and laughed . " Le petit coin , eh ? Well , in that case , I release you to the claims of Nature . But return at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . A tantot ! " Following the side path of the garden , Richard avoided strolling couples here and there and finally reached the distant circle of lawn around the sundial . But he found it empty , as he expected . There was only the marble nymph pallid in the moonlight , only the rustle of leaves among the oleanders . Short of breath and his head swimming a little from the champagne , he stood awhile glad of the cool air and the quiet . Gradually the voice of Amelie des Landes , the thoughts of her , faded in his mind . The gold in his pockets , the success he had had , the promised contract at San Luca 's , seemed less important now . If only he had been able to keep the appointment with Maritza , what might it have led to in the future ! And yet the time with Amelie des Landes had passed very quickly , had seemed very pleasant . After all , he could have met Maritza if he had really cared enough . He walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoinedthe Countess and Tromba at one of the faro tables . To the profit of Madame des Landes , who copied his bets , the flood tide of the evening still held . His coins on the layout almost invariably won  --  even against Tromba , when the latter acted as bank . " You see ! " the Countess exulted . " You 're better than a gold mine . All I need is to hang on your luck . Did n't I tell you how it would be ! One more bet , and then shall we dance ? Harken ! The violins ! I 'm sure they 'll give us a minuet . " But even though Richard now felt tipsy to the point where nothing mattered , the evening had lost its earlier sparkle . It was like a room where some of the candles have burned out . He found himself tripping through a minuet with Madame des Landes . Then other partners claimed her . He danced a quadrille with two gentildonneand a young blood of the Renier fancily , who would not have looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he climbed to the musicians ' gallery , chatted with his old friends of the orchestra , told them the good news of the San Luca appointment , and drank too much of their red wine . Consciousness began breaking into fragments , some vague , some vivid . He was dancing again with Am ( lie des l , andes . IIer rank and the fact that she was perhaps twenty-three to his nineteen had become indifferent . Suppose they were to slip out into the garden . The thought of being alone with her . . . Marcello Tromba strolled in from the gaming tables . He stood looking at them , waiting till the end of the dance . It would be hard to get away from him . Then , happening to glance across the room , Richard saw Maritza Venier . She was seated in one of the small gilt chairs next to an older woman , probably Countess Widiman 's companion . How long she had been there , Richard could not tell . In his present foggy state of mind , she simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze . " Ali , la petite Venier . Pity no one asks her to dance . She 's good at that . Do you know her ? " " A little . " The Countess 's eyes deepened a moment , then looked away . " I 'd like to be that age again . . " she smiled 62 63At the first pause , when Tromba had replaced him , Richard crossed the room and made his bow to Maritza and her companion . In spite of his drinking , he felt more than a little unsure . " Siora Aurelia Benito  --  Sior Morandi , " she said formally , presentinghim . The role of Count Roberto , which had availed him so much all evening , began to show cracks at this point . He found it hard to keep up the fashionable pose with her . " I was hoping  --  " he began . " May I have the honor of a ( lance , madonna ? " She shook her head . " Thank you , no . I 'm not dancing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comedy . You were excellent . " Her eyes were direct and clear as ever . It would have been hard to define the difference in her manner , but there was a world of difference . For some reason , he felt stripped of his borrowed clothes and paste jewels . At another time , he would not have referred to their thwarted meeting in the presence of Signora Aurelia , who probably knew nothing about it ; but at the moment he did n't care . " I expected to see you after the play , siora . I was detained for a time . Then I looked for you  --  " " Indeed ? Well , sior , I waited . When you did n't come , of course I knew that you were  --  detained . " " A thousand excuses ! I ca n't tell you  --  " " La bela cossa ! " she interrupted , stressing the Venetian accent . If she had frozen him , if she had looked hurt , it would not have been so bad ; but she only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cause for excuses . I did n't mind waiting at all . Since then , I 've had a pleasant evening admiring you as a man of fashion . " " I do n't believe I understand . " But he understood perfectly . " No ? " she said . " Well , it 's not important . " And as the music struck up again , she added : " Do n't let us detain you . Good night . And , again , congratulations ! " If a door had been closed in his face , the dismissal could not have been more definite . The two ladies nodded to his bow . He could only drift away . He tried to do this with dignity , but staggered a little as he walked . IXDRUNKENNESS uses any fuel to promote itself . High and low spirits alike demand another glass and another . But gloom has the one advantage over elation that it tempts a man to drink alone and spares him the ridicule of making an ass of himself in public . It was fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn at this point and got him out of the ballroom . Whatever the customs of northern Europe , intoxication had no place in Italian society and was considered unpardonable . The truth is that Richardhimself had so little experience of it , especially in the wake of champagne , that he hardly knew what was happening to him . Dizzy and morose , he wandered away from the dance , finally reached the buffet , and drank a couple of more glasses . Maritza 's recent words gave the pattern to his thought . Actingthe man of fashion , he brooded . Given the special favor of prancinghere for a night in Tromba 's Parisian suit . Clown of the villa . People winking at each other behind his hack . Shabby comedian ! Capering after Madame des Landes ! Getting hot about her ! Poor cub ! Iiow Maritza Venier had seen through him ! I low different she was in point of reality from the others ! And what was he ? A sham . And now a sot . He had reached the stage where every idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Why should a simple young girl like Maritza burst his bubble and put him iu this humor ? Was it because he had actually fallen in love with her ? In that case , the more fool he  --  and even so he had made a mess of it . Several people , strolling up to the buffet , spoke to him civilly ; but in his present mood every smile was a sneer and every word , a prick . IIe murmured an answer and tried to look as if something of consequence called him away , then forced his unsteady legs to walk an imaginary straight line out into the hall . Thank God , here to the left was an empty card room . Entering it , he slumped down on a chair at the end of a long faro table , with the layout of spades painted on the green cloth . He was now almost completely drunk . The paneled walls of the room , with gilded cupids romping along the cornice , tipped up and down , merging with the frescoed ceiling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrors blurred and swam. 64What happened then did not have to make sense or stand in any apparent connection with anything else . Indeed , it hardly surprisedRichard to be facing an old gentleman seated at the other end of the table whom he had been too foggy to notice when he came in . The old gentleman had a bottle of cognac at his elbow and was dealing himself a hand at cards . His face looked waxen ; his bushy eyebrows gave him the appearance of an owl . Stopping absently to taste his liquor , he became aware of Richard , then gave a start ; his slate-gray eyes widened ; he sat staring and lowered the glass to the table . It was as if he found himself in company with an apparition . Somewhat nettled , Richard stared back . At the same moment , he realized vaguely that this was Count Hercule des Landes , who had been pointed out to him once . " Grand Dieu ! " breathed the latter finally . " Dammy , but I 'm amazed ! My dear friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ! " He tried to get up , but sat down hard and drew a hand across his forehead . " It seems a long time . Welcome , cher Miler , welcome ! " In Richard 's condition , this was too much to untangle . He was certainly not the Count 's dear friend , and yet des Landes knew his nickname . He shook his head . The old gentleman was drunk  --  no doubt of it  --  drunk as an oyster . They were both drunk together . He answered in French . " A votre service , monseigneur . How do you happen to call me Miler ? " " Is n't that what you 're usually called ? " " Yes . " " Why do you call me monseigneur ? " " Is n't that your title ? " Des Landes waved his hand . " Mon cher ami , do not let us become involved with words . It 's always confusing . I perceive you are drunk . So am I. Our natural state when we 're together . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved the bottle and a glass along the table . Richard filled up . They sat vacantly smiling at each other . " I hope you 've kept well ? " said the Count . " Very . And you ? " " Not bad , Miler . A twinge of the gout , a touch of the gravel . No trouble from women a force de precautions . But , speaking of them  --  " des Landes 's eyes lit up , he raised his glass  --  " a la there65petite Lulu , eh ! Your wench and mine ! The sweetest trull on earth ! " Though completely in the dark , Richard drank as proposed . " Yes , indeed , " the Count added , wiping his mouth , " that must always be the first toast between us . " He smacked his lips . " We 've fought over the hussy . We 've diced for her . Now yours , now mine . A real bond between us . Quelles cuisses sympathiques ! Quelles fesses adorables ! Remember that night at the Opera ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Richard complied . The cupids on the cornice were swinging in wider arcs . He focused his eyes on the Count , who was staring again . " But , curse me , she 's dead , " des Landes whispered suddenly , " dead long ago . And  --  come to that  --  why , ventredieu , you 're dead , too , are n't you ? Seems to me  --  " He broke off . " What is this ? Where am 1 ? What place is this ? " " The Villa Bagnoli . " " Never heard of it . Are n't you dead ? " Richard had some trouble with his tongue . He got out : " If you 'll only tell me who you think I am , I 'll tell you whether I 'm dead or not . " It did n't seem quite right , but it was the best he could do . Des Landes frowned . " My poor Charles , you 're pretty fuddled . Dammy , when a man forgets his own name , lie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on . " Make an effort . You 're Charles Hammond , Baron Marny . Called the Black Baron because you 're so cursed dark . Aha ! Cela to rafraichit la boussole ? You do n't have to gape over it . " Richard 's scalp prickled . There was a tinge of nightmare in this . He knew little enough about the family of Hammond ; but he knew that his grandfather had been Charles Baron Marny , nicknamedthe Black Baron . Obviously Hercule des Landes had been a crony of this nobleman . Obviously , too , Richard bore a strong likeness to him . Or perhaps the latter was not only drunk but dreaming . " Dead a long time , " Richard muttered . " A la bonheur ! " said des Landes . " It 's all 1 wanted to know . Makes no difference . A trifle anyway . Must confess it seems to agree with you . " IIe kept pinching his forehead and shaking his head , as if trying to clear it , but finally gave up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love your company . We 've had fun together , eh ? You old scoundrel ! You old Seven Sins ! I never knew a sweeter devil . Must come from being a Stuart . Am I right , Fitzroy ? " " Stuart ? " Richard mumbled . " Thought you said Hammond . " " Fi done ! " Des Landes sagged to one side of his chair but straightened himself . " Why d' you pretend with me ? Everybody knows that Milady your mother , God rest her , side-stepped with His Majesty . A good thing , too , for the family fortunes . But if they did n't know it , ma foi , all that 's necessary is to look at you and a portrait of King Charles . Pity he did n't live to see you . You might have been a duke . It 's no disgrace to he a royal bastard . Quite the contrary . " Richard lifted his glass . " To all bastards ! " he said thickly . Des Landes drank and nodded . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large view of things , just like the late Baron your legal father . And right they were . Why stew about nothing ? If there 's one man I despise , it 's the jealous pedant . That can never be charged to me . I tell any wife of mine : Madame , you have my name ; I have your dot . Good ! We have no further claims on each other except a regard for appearances . Amuse yourself , and I shall do the same . If God blesses our union with offspring , I shall be duly grateful and pay you my compliments . Adieu then , ma vie , until we meet again . ' That , Miler , is the only polite and sensible philosophy . " Richard inquired : " Have you been married more than once ? " " God , yes . Strange you 've forgotten . " Des Landes began countingand pressed a thumb down on the table . " Annette de Rochemartin  --  ioo , 000 livres . Not bad , eh ? Gave me two sons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger . " Gabrielle de la Popeliniere  --  200,000 livres . The best I 've done with any of them . Roturiere , but rich . Died of smallpox . " He pressed the middle finger next to the others . " Marie des Charmettes  --  only 25,000 livres . Won her at cards from her father , the Marquis . Big mistake . She lived a long time . Had some daughters , who are now in a convent . I could n't afford to marry ' em off . As it was , my sons ate me up , until they were both killed at Fontenoy . " The Count fell silent , tapping uncertainly with his ring finger . " Parbleu ! " he hesitated . " It 's odd how names slip . The present Countess . . . 50,000 livres . Good to look at . Une fausse maigre. 67The King had Boucher paint her in the buff for his little apartmentsat the Trianon . And , confidentially  --  " Des Landes winked . " Well , enough said . What 's the name ? Aymee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Richard suggested . " You 're right , by God . Amelie de Clancarthy . Trust you to know the name of my wife when you forget your own . But be careful , mon vieux Charles . Take a tip from me . She 's the Devil 's first cousin . Quite as bad as I am . We 're most congenial . Know her fa-ther ? " Richard shook his head . " A mad Irish Jacobite . Stuck to your kinsman , the Stuart Pretender . But clever , too . Feathered his nest with one of the de Bussy heiresses . Only trouble is , that dot 's about spent . Money goes fast . " Doubtless by an association of ideas , des Landes 's eyes wandered to the sunburst of amethysts around the diamond on Richard 's coat . " Fine decoration you 've got there , Mili r . What order is it ? " Increasingly Richard found talk a burden . " Do n't remember , " he mumbled . " Where 'd you get it ? " " Shah of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Loyalty to Tromba exacted a quibble . " What do you think ? " Des Landes chuckled . " Paste . Remember that ring you paid me your losses with at Chantilly ? Cre Dien ! What a swindle ! Two carats of glass . " Even in his befuddlement , it occurred to Richard that his grandfatherand the Count must have been two rogues of the same kind . " But no matter , " des Landes went on , " I 'd have done the same in your place . Anyway , we settled it , like gentlemen , on the field of honor . A good fight , and let bygones he bygones . " His eyes rested again on the decoration . " How much do you value it ? " " Thousand livres , " Richard gave the first figure that came to him . " Dear at a hundred , " snapped the other . " However , I 'll dice you for it at that figure . " " Do n't care to play . " It was too complicated to explain the68ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was becoming a merry-go-round  --  cupids , frescoes , mirrors , and the Count himself . Richard planted his elbows on the table to keep from fallingoff . " Of course you 'll play , " cackled des Landes . " Never saw you refusea wager yet . Or put up a hundred livres , if you please . I do n't care . " From one of his side pockets , the Count produced a dice box , which he rattled invitingly , though in doing so he began to slump under the table , and it took an effort to straighten up . " Only , we 've wasted enough time . Dammy , a man 's got to play or he 'll die of boredom . " Mechanically Richard found some of the coins he had won at faro and clapped them down . Might as well  --  whether he was the Black Baron or not . Part of the merry-go-round had become a seesaw , now rising , now falling . " Ho ! " said des Landes . " I see you 're in funds . Tant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box along the table . " Where 's your money ? " Richard asked . " Money ? Let 's see . . . " The Count felt in his pockets and shrugged . " I seem to be unprovided at the moment . Purse upstairs . You can have my note . " Richard was not so drunk as that . " No , thanks . " The other glared . " Foutre ! You deny me credit for a scurvy hundredlivres ? You question my honor ? By God , in that case  --  " " What then ? " Richard 's mood , having covered most of the scale , now turned hot . Meeting des Landes 's stare , he gathered up his coins . " You know what then . Sacredieu , monsieur , I think I have a thrust that will teach you manners ! Or , if you want pistols  --  " But the Count 's love of play outbalanced his wrath . He looked uneasilyat the disappearing coins and contrived a smile . " Mon vieux Charles , why do we always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tell you I 'm unprovided . But remember Mademoiselle Lulu . Rememberthe last time we diced for her ? " He brought up a reminiscencein detail . " So , what do you say to Amelie ? You do n't get a king 's mistress every day for a hundred livres . " Fighting nausea , Richard shoved back from the table and tried vainly to stand up. 69 " What 's matter , Miler ? " " Sale maquereau ! " Richard got out before his native Venetian took over , and he ran on in waterfront terms that did not need to be translated . " Ahal " said the Count . Somehow struggling up , he found his sword hilt , his face more masklike than ever . Then an odd change came over him . Like a marionette when the strings are no longer pulled , he sat down with a jolt and began to slide gently under the table . The lace at his throat bent up a moment above the edge . There was a last glimpse of his yellow face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a broad-shouldered lackey who had evidently been biding his time in the corridor entered , moved the table , and , lifting his master up in a practised grip , conveyed him out of the room . A clock somewhere struck the hour of three . XMUCH later that morning Richard awakened with a splitting headache and corresponding remorse . Ile vaguely remembered reaching his cot in Tromba 's dressing room by the aid of the Cavaliere 's valet , who had also doubtless undressed him . Now , managing to get up , he held his still curled and pomaded head in a basin , drank a quart of water , and lay down again , though not to sleep . Characteristically , when the hammering behind his forehead eased a little , repentance took the form of an idea for a comedy , in which he would be the harlequin and laughingstock . Even the title came to him  --  The Sham Gallant ( Il Finto Galante ) . It would be bitterto write and funny to look at . IIe would not spare himself a single lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters were all there : Maritza , the Countess , Tromba , des Landes and himself , the dressed-up booby showing off . He had only to point it up a bit , and the thing was done . It would be his penance , his amends to himself . Man of fashion ! Cacasangue ! Ile never wanted to hear the term again . After a while , with a certain satisfaction in his old clothes and70darned stockings , he got dressed , tried to tie his hair back in the usual way ( it would take some time to wash the grease out of it ) , and looked over the proceeds of last night . But even the three silver-gilt snuffboxes , Madonna Tron 's pin , and a hundred and nine sequins in cash , brightened him chiefly with the thought that he could now afford to get away from the Villa Bagnoli and back to Venice . It was an easy trudge to Fusina , an easy ferry from there across the lagoon to the Angelo Raffael landing on the Giudecca Canal . " Home ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy the beau monde with my compliments ! " Some time later , at Tromba 's prescription , two cups of black coffee and a glass of brandy enabled him to stand the sight of the Cavaliere , fresh as ever , breakfasting in bed on chocolate and rolls . But , even so , Richard turned his eyes away when Tromba , dunking a well-buttered crust in the thick fluid , plopped it into his mouth and began buttering another . " My dear boy , " said the Cavaliere , motioning him to a chair beside the bed , " your performance last night was beyond praise  --  up to a point . A small point since only I observed it . But a man of fashion  --  " Seeing Richard wince , he broke off to ask what was wrong . " Nothing , Zelenza . A touch of headache . " " Exactly . As I was saying , a man of fashion must learn how to drink . You may not believe it , but I took no more than three glasses all evening and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to our mutual contentment . That leaves a man relaxed and in good appetite . Whereas , liquor  --  " " The Countess  --  ? " Richard swallowed his question but not in time . Tromba smiled . " You can hardly expect me to answer that , figliolo mio . A man of breeding never names his conquests until he 's old enough to write memoirs , and then it does n't matter . But I 'll tell you this time with chagrin that it was not the adorable Amelie . There 's a nymph who likes to drive men mad with her hideand-seek . It seems to me that she actually had more of a penchant for you . But I do n't intend to give up . Which reminds me of another matter . " Tromba poured himself a second cup and buttered a third roll . " At the dance last night , " he went on , " I could not help noting71that you addressed yourself to the little Venier girl . No accountingfor tastes , my dear boy . If she 's the kind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she cut you pretty short ; that you then left the ballroom , went on drinking , and did not return . I 'm no mind reader , but one and one equals two . " " Let me explain  --  " " Another time , " said Tromba . " I simply want to make this point . You seem to be in love . When a man of fashion is rebuffed , he does not slink off . He retires , smiling  --  to renew the attack later , and if necessary , again and again . Believe me , at last the fort will be taken . " " I do n't understand , Lustrissimo . I 'm in no position to marry the Siora Maritza . " " Marry her ? Lord save us ! Who spoke of marrying ? Who in his senses would marry a girl as poor as that ? My dear boy , at times your simplicity disturbs me . " Tromba shook his head but added : " However , do n't be concerned . I guarantee you 'll grow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to say is this . As far as mannersare concerned , the bearing , address  --  in brief , the externals  --  of a man of fashion , you 've learned an amazing lot in a few days . I suppose your skill as an actor accounts for it . You give every promiseof distinction . But what you and I must now work on is something more fundamental : the purpose underlying manners , the philosophy of success . " Twenty-four hours ago , Richard would have been charmed by Tromba 's compliments and delighted by the prospect of his continuedinstruction . Now , with a bad head and a fuzzy mouth , he felt indifferent to both . The idea of distinction ii- the lofty circlesthat included the old Count des Landes was considerably wilted . The thought , too , of hanging on somehow at the Villa Bagnoli revolted him . But the Cavaliere had been generosity itself , and he did not wish to seem unappreciative . So , he suggested that , having been given the freedom of the Villa last night on a footing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddling in the orchestra . " Of course you could n't , " agreed Tromba . " I had no thought of it . I herewith appoint you , caro Milor , as my confidential secretary . You will continue to share these rooms , and I shall supply you72from my wardrobe .  --  For God 's sake , throw away that filthy suit you have on ; it no longer fits your condition .  --  You will thus have a respectable position here , and when I leave in a few days to visit Senator Grimani near Stra , you will accompany me . We 'll return to Venice in October and lodge at the Grimani Palace . " " But my contract at San Luca 's  --  " " Think no more of it . You are now promoted from comedian to man of affairs . You see , dear boy , I have resolved to make you my associate . It 's the first time I have ever taken such a step . Your performance last night decided me . I think we shall be very useful to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Richard had often wondered about the affairs to which Tromba rather obscurely referred . What business carried him up and down Europe , sojourning now in one capital , now in another , flitting from spa to spa , the intimate of ministers , generals , and grands seigneurs , at home everywhere ? Was he the agent of some prince ? How did he manage to live on such a big scale ? Tromba answered : " My associate in pleasure , Mil6r . Is n't that an attractive profession ? " He emptied his last cup and pushed the breakfast tray to one side . " Let me explain . Pleasure is the mainspringof life and pleasure is my business . But the kind I like costs money . So , in various ways , money must be got . That offers excitement , and excitement also gives pleasure . As my associate , then , you would share both in the end and the means . " " What means ? " " Good Lord ! " Tromba smiled . " They 're so many that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obvious . I do n't cheat at cards , but I know how to play . The institution of lotteries is often profitable . Occultism 's another line . " Richard asked : " What is occultism , your Signory ? " Tromba coughed . " How shall I define it ? It has been my fortune to travel much in the East . I have learned many of those secret arts which give to the Magi their supernatural powers . I am familiar with the cabala . I can foresee the future , summon the dead , restore youth , command demons , enlarge jewels , and the like . I shall communicate this knowledge to you , but it takes study and practice . " 73ested . Perhaps you 're beginning to understand what it means to become my associate . " Whether Tromba himself believed in the mystical powers of the new sect would have been impossible to tell from his expression . His face was grave , his voice convincing . But Richard , with his presentheadache , felt no attraction to occultism . However dished up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luca 's , the thought of writing The Sham Gallant , seemed a good deal more solid and , at the moment , more desirable . Besides , he was shrewd enough to wonder at Tromba 's offer . Remembering the latter 's philosophy of humbug , he felt certain that altruism did not wholly account for it . " A great honor , Lustrissimo , " he said . " But why me ? " Reading his thought , the other chose to he frank . " A sensiblequestion , Miler , " he nodded . " I might tell you how much I loved you , but I hope you would not be taken in by it . I 'm making the proposal , of course , because I believe you would be of profit to me , not here in Venice  --  here you would simply be continuing your studies in the art of success under my direction  --  but in England . " " In England ? " Richard exclaimed . " Yes . A rich and promising country . I intend to visit it after leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Goldoni has told me the story of your birth , that you are the son of Miler the Count  --  they call it earl there , I believe  --  of Marny , who is one of the leading noblemen of that kingdom . You 're his only son , so far as I know . It would be my object to establish you in his good graces . In that event , your fortune would be made , and I would obtain the introduction I need to the best circles there . I might even expect a more tangible reward . Until last night , I had my doubts of the game ; now I 'm convinced that you can win the stakes . A most glittering career . There 's the plan in a nutshell . And I deserve your thanks . " But to Tromba 's surprise , Richard shook his head . " My thanks , indeed , Zelenza , though I 'm afraid it wo n't do . " " In God 's name , why not ? " " Because Mother and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do it against her wish . " " Look , man . " Tromba launched into a description of the caRichardmight still have some illusions , but he had not grown up in theatrical circles for nothing . Besides , he had heard the claims of too many carnival fakirs to be impressed . " I see , " he nodded . " No , my dear boy , you do n't see at all . You are thinking of vulgarcharlatans you have known  --  Professor This-or-That on his platform at a fair . You have no idea of the difference when a CavaHereTromba reveals some of his science to the proper people at the proper time and place . The approach , the effect , and the rewards are all of a higher order . But I find that occultism is best employed in connection with some other project , such as I am engaged on at present . " Tromba broke off , rearranged his nightcap , which had shifted to one side of his shaved head , and gave Richard a sharp glance. " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can depend on me , Zelenza . Surely you do n't imagine that I would repay all your kindness by betraying you . " " No , I do n't believe you would , " said i roniba . " Besides , you have more to gain by holding your tongue . Well , then , have you ever heard of the Freemasons ? " Richard 's eyes narrowed . Of course he had heard of that society , which was then spreading through Europe . Unlike the AngloSaxonparent organization , it had taken a turn on the Continent toward free thought and radical politics . Banned in Austria and Russia , it was looked at askance in Venice and other Catholic states and , because of the mystery surrounding it , was popularly considered a menace to church and society . But Richard had heard it favorably spoken of by Goldoni , who inclined to the liberal side , and he was , therefore , interested rather than shocked by Tromba 's question . " Zelenza , yes , " he answered . " Well , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honorable order limited in various ways . It is my purpose to extend it by including Eastern occultism older than the Pharaohs , and I am at present founding lodges with that end in view . The mystical powers acquired by belonging to this new order are beyond price . As its founder , I am the benefactor of all the initiates , and their gratitude is valuable . Several of the patricians here are much inter-74 75reer open to Lord Marny 's son . Illegitimacy did n't much matter . A purchased seat in Parliament covered that drawback . There was the foreign service , the army , the court , a rich marriage . There was wealth , distinction , fashion . " Instead of being a door mat for peoplelike Marin Sagredo , you could hold up your head with any of them . Instead of scurrying for a living , you 'd be independent . Do you mean to tell me that you 'd give up all these advantages for the sake of farfetched sentiments ? " Richard could see no use arguing the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with money . " " And how about me ? " Tromba continued . " Only last night , you were abounding in gratitude . If I asked you for a service , it would be the happiest day of your life . Well , fortunately , I know how much that kind of talk is worth . " " But , your Signory , this does n't depend on me . It involves my mother . " " Persuade her , then . I suppose she 's not an imbecile . " " I 'll talk it over with her , Zelenza . " " When ? " " Tonight . " " So you 're set on returning to Venice . What of the employment I offered you ? " " Give me leave to think it over . " " Ah , " said Tromba . And at that point suddenly his frown cleared ; he even smiled . Whatever his shortcomings , he knew human nature . Let the young fool go back to Venice , spend the windfall he had picked up here , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tromba had outlined for him . Every jog-trot day would remind him of it . But he would soon forget his present headache and calf-love affair , if that was the trouble . Then , too , there was something else that would incline him to England , something which the Cavaliere had foreseen and to a certain extenthad helped along . " Well , my boy , you must do as you please . Think it over . There 's no hurry . I do n't expect to leave Venice until Lent . We 'll see each other from time to time , I hope . And please remember that I 'm very much your friend , whatever you decide regarding England . " Richard , whose sense of indebtedness to his patron was beginning to take the latter 's part , thanked him warmly . Tromba added : " It 's hard for me to believe that a youth of your spirit , abilities , and prospects , will be permanently content with small beer instead of burgundy . But , if so , make up your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Venice . Has that occurred to you ? " " Somewhere else ? " The Cavaliere smiled . " Of course . Unless you keep hidden . And the stage at San Luca 's is just about as public as the Piazzetta . I hope you do n't imagine that the Very Noble Marin Sagredo is goingto forget last night . Our vendetta was too complete for that . Or do you think , because we made an ass of him here , that he 's beneathyour notice ? " Tromba wagged a long forefinger . " When you meet him again , Miler , it wo n't be in private theatricals , and it wo n't be a battle of wits . Every advantage will be his . You ca n't have the thing both ways ; you ca n't be a poor comedian and at the same time a match for the leading young magnifico of Venice , if he chooses to pay off his grudge . Take my word for it . I hope it 's a word to the wise . " Since the victory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The thought of him now in this sober morning-after brought something of a chill . The report was that after the play he had left in a rage for one of his family villas near Mestre and so out of the Brenta neighborhood . But he would certainly be back in Venice for the winter season . Tromba did not exaggerate the dangers connected with that return ; they were very real and worth considering . Their present effect on Richard , however , was defiance . " I 'll not be chased out of Venice by him ! " Tromba shrugged . " Lucky if you 're not chased out of life . Still , it 's your problem . " He pulled the bell rope for his valet and tossed the sheet back from his muscular legs . " Time to begin the labors of the day . Since you insist on leaving , good-by with my blessing  --  whatever that may be worth . " At Fusina later , Richard missed the public ferry to Venice , and rather than wait for the next , indulged himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . It was soothing to recline on the cushions of the little cabin , as the boatman sculled him across the77three-mile lagoon . Memories of the Villa Bagnoli drifted far behind him . His birthplace , the millennial city , drew nearer . It had never seemed to him so beautiful . With half-closed eyes , he watched its domes and campaniles mellowing in the gold of sunset . Bells faintly sounded the Angelus . From far away , over the hushed water , he caught the notes of a familiar song from some peota returning laden with merrymakers who had spent the day on the mainland . The tune became words in his mind . Roma xe grande , e xe Venezia bola ; Rona xe santa , e xe Venezia bona .. It was like a welcome home . The towers rose higher against the saffron sky . Ile could ahnost hear the murmur of the city . He would soon be gliding between the ancient walls again , past the Giudecca , past St. Mary of Salvation , into that great harbor of St. Mark , thronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crossed himself . The thought , inarticulate enough , hovered in his mind that he had been dreaming awhile and was now awake . The world of the Brenta seemed like the feverish vision of an unsubstantial masquerade . XIRICHARD 'S mother , Jeanne Morandi , had been thinking of him on that late afternoon , when the sound of an opening door and of his familiar footsteps in the entry of the apartment brought her hurryingfrom her room . " Richard ! Mon tresor ! " Her face reflected its former beauty at that moment . He half lifted her from her feet , swinging her back and forth . " Petite Maman ! Well , here I am again ! " A torrent of exclamations carried them out of the vestibule beforeJeanne could ask : " But , Richard , what 's happened ? You were to be two months with the orchestra  --  until October . Is anything wrong ? " " Wait ! " He swept her over to the table of the salon . " Just78wait ! " Down came a heavy purse , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " But , Richard . . . ! " Down came the snuffboxes . " There ! " " Mais , cheri ! " " And there ! " He handed her the jeweled brooch of the Signora Tron . " A little present for you . Is n't it pretty ? Do n't you like it ? " She stared at the gems , bewildered . " It 's beautiful . But how .. . Wo n't you explain ? " He enjoyed teasing her . " Where 's Babbo ? " It was the nickname for his stepfather . " Out for supper , " she said absently . " And have you good news , " Richard asked , " from Julio and Carlo ? " These were his half brothers at school in Padua . " Yes , very good .  --  Why do you plague me like this ? I demand to be told  --  " But at this point , Nana , the bouncing little maid of all work , hurried in from the kitchen to greet Richard , and Jeanne 's curiosity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out , flicking angrily at the objects on the table , " if you do n't answer me and explain how you got these things , I 'll think you 're a robber . " Then at last he plunged into the story . But there was so much to tell , to describe , to be told over again , that it took him through supper . And afterwards on the small balcony of the apartment , which overlooked the little square of St. John Chrysostom , they had only begun to talk . A hot summer night , smelling of ancient walls and streets , languishedbetween the surrounding houses . Though in the center of Venice , not far from the Rialto and the Merceria , it was a quiet neighborhood at that hour , since the Piazza of St. Mark and other open or waterfront sections of the city attracted most of the population . A shimmer of moonlight brought out the silhouette of the nearby church , the scattered chimney pots along the roof line of buildings , and the distant bulk of the San Giangrisostomo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep enough to be private from the street , two floors below , and from neighboring balconies. 79Half reclining on a chaise longue , with Richard in a chair beside her , Jeanne exclaimed : " I want to hear it all again ! Just who is the Chevalier de Tromba ? You have n't told me exactly . " Richard hesitated . It seemed odd , after the companionship of the past week , that he could hardly answer her question . " A gentleman of Naples , " he said . " He has brought letters from the Cardinal de Bemis and Monsieur de Voltaire . He 's protected here by SenatorGrimani and other big people . " Richard wished that he felt as convinced about Tromba as he sounded . Their conversation that morning had left him uncomfortable . By his own admission , the Cavaliere was plainly an adventurer . However , let him be what he might , lie had been generousand frank with Richard ; and the latter had promised to respecthis confidence . He had even promised , hopelessly enough , to discuss the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment as any . " By the way , when Monsieur de Tromba leaves Venice , he plans to visit London . He invited me to go with him . " " Why ? " Her voice was suddenly tense . " You see , he learned about my father from l ) r . Goldoni . It seems that Milor de Marny is a great man iuu England , much greater and richer than he was years ago . I le has no children . Monsieurde Tromba would like to bring the two of us together . " " Why ? " It was a frozen syllable . " To be honest , the Cavaliere wishes an entrvge in England . Aside from that , he thinks it would make my fortune . " After a silence , Jeanne asked in the same compressed voice : " What answer did you give him ? " " I said that I could do nothing without your permission , that I would talk it over with you . " Another pause . " My permission is n't necessary , Richard . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaning forward , he covered her hand with his . " Petite Maman ! I answered him that way because I expected you to say no . Then I would n't have to argue about it . What could I do in England ? You and the people I care for are here . Besides , I want to write plays and I want to act at San Luca 's . Money is n't everything . Why should I hang on to Lord Marny now , when we 've gotten along without him all these years ? Ridiculous ! " 80At once the tension was gone . Her hand relaxed . " What a tease you are ! You actually frightened me . Of course I say no . Of course it 's ridiculous . And I think you ought to be wary of that man Tromba . " Her thought evidently drifted off . " So Monsieur de Marny 's grown rich and great and has no children . Well , he chose riches and greatness . One ca n't have everything . I suppose he 's content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally Richard brought up Marin Sagredo . To Jeanne 's amusement , he gave a lively account of the vendetta ; and , as he was not above dramatizing himself , the story lost nothing in his telling of it . " Still , " she commented , " it would be serious if the young man bears a grudge . But perhaps he 'll forget ; perhaps he 's too proud to notice you . I hope so . Otherwise  --  " She broke off . " Otherwise , what ? " It startled him that she echoed Tromba 's opinion . " You 'd have to leave Venice  --  for a while . The patricians are masters here . I do n't believe I 've told you that Babbo has been asked to conduct the opera at Bordeaux next year . If we go , you could go with us . There 's the Italian Comedy in Paris . It 's time you saw more of the world , Sagredo or not . " " I do n't intend to run away from him . " She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges . The theaters wo n't open for two months . Probably by that time Monsieur de Sagredo wo n't remember that Richard Morandi exists .  --  So , you were Count for a night and danced with that charming Madame des Landes ? Was she very pretty ? What did she wear ? " As he talked , it struck Richard all at once that his disgust with the fashionable world had , like his headache , waned a good deal since morning . In comparison with the present surroundings  --  the stuffy little square , the jumble of middle-class houses  --  the Villa Bagnoli took on glamor again . He could smell the jasmine of Amelie des Landes 's dress ; he remembered the enchantment of her eyes in the candlelight over the champagne glasses ; he recalled the glorified image of himself in Tromba 's mirror . Even the raffish close of yesterday evening , the Count des Landes and himself at the seesawing table , began to seem more amusing than blameworthy , though he did not tell his mother about it . Perhaps , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tromba . The next six weeks in Venice were apt to be dull . So , his descriptions of life on the Brenta were glowing enough . It was not until afterwards , and then with a casualness which did not escape Jeanne , that he asked : " By the way , Mother , do you happen to know anything about the Antonio Veniers ? He seems to have married an Austrian ballerina . " She nodded . " Yes , of course . Twenty years ago , everybody in opera knew of Helene Venier . She was a great dancer . I met her when she first came to Venice as a bride . Her husband married her in Vienna . She 's dead now , I think . A lovely woman .  --  Why do you ask ? " " I met her daughter , Maritza Venicr . She was visiting the Widimans . " Jeanne did not need to be especially perceptive to catch something on the wind . Richard 's voice was too carefully impersonal . " Ah ? Did you like her ? " " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a ballerinalike her mother . " " Indeed ? " Jeanne feigned indifference . A pause followed . Then , in the darkness , her eves quickened when he added : " She 's different from any girl I ever niet . So unconven-tional . " Jeanne said skillfully : " Pert , I suppose ? These modern girls cheapen themselves . " IIe forgot his mask . " I do n't mean that at all . There 's nothing cheap about her  --  and nothing pert . I im ant unconventional in being sincere and frank and just herself ... 1 meant ... " Flushed into the open now , he ran on at length , while Jeanne speculated . She said skillfully again : " And so you fell in love ? Well , mon cher poulain , it 's not the first time . You 're always in love with one girl or another . There was the little Annetta Bari at San Luca 's , and there was Maria Fontanelli of our troupe , and Bettina  --  " " Please ! " he broke in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't right to speak of them and Maritza Venier in the same breath . They 're just ordinary girls . She  --  " He sought in vain for the right word . " Well , for one thing , she 's a patrician . " Having now learned enough , Jeanne became serious . " And who are you  --  if you 're really in love ? Have you thought of that ? Do n't you see  --  " He interrupted . " We 're both poor . Her mother was on the stage . She wants to go on the stage herself . No , I do n't see . And , besides , as regards birth  --  " What he had found out last night from des Landes was too good to keep . He swelled a little . " Mother , did you know that my grandfather , Baron Marny , was really the son of King Charles of England , and that I 'm the spit and image of him ? Did you know that ? " Omitting the drunkenness , he told her somethingof his talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Yes , I knew . Your father showed me a miniature once of the Black Baron . You 're very like him . He was a great rascal , I believe . And I know the rumorthat he was a son of the King . What of it , Richard ? " " What of it ? Well , if so , I should think that my blood was just as good as the Veniers ' . You spoke as if  --  " Reaching out , she laid her hand on his knee . " No , I did n't mean that . I meant your position in the world . You say she 's poor . What have you to offer her ? Do you think she cares for you ? " The question brought Richard down to earth . He had let the topic carry him too far , and now managed a smile . " You 've put your finger on the sore spot there , Mother . No , she does n't care for me at all  --  just the contrary . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting and described the rebuff Maritza had given him in the ballroom . " And in spite of that , you 're still in love with her ? " He shrugged . " Do n't worry . I 'm not a fool . You 're right . I have nothing to offer her . Only , I 'd like to see her again and explain ... " His voice dropped off . " Better not , " said Jeanne . " Better keep to your Annettas and Bettinas for a while , mon cher . This Mademoiselle de Venier sounds like a nice girl . You 're not old enough to think of marriage . Take my advice before it 's too late , before you 're too much involved . " She opened her fan brusquely . For a minute , only the click of it was heard . Her thought reached a point at some distance from Maritza Venier . " Will you do me a favor ? " she asked impulsively . " It 's important . " 82 83 " Of course I will , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must try to put that talk with the Comte des Landes out of your mind  --  the Black Baron and the rest of it . You have better ancestors to think of . Will you prom-ise ? " " Bon Dieu ! " Expecting a different request , Richard laughed . " I do n't take that seriously . " " I hope not . Be sure you never do . Will you promise ? " He was glad to humor her . " I promise . But how did you happen to think of it ? " She hesitated . " I hardly know . It came to me that it 's sometimesdangerous to give life to the dead . " XIITIIE motives that govern youth are not always clear to youth itself . Richard had returned to Venice fired with the idea for a play which , by ridiculing his own folly that night at the Villa Bagnoli , would be good for his soul and at the sane tine amuse the public . But somehow the theme , or rather his zeal for it , faded during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mooned a good deal , sauntered about , purchased a new wardrobe , and spent time at the coffeehouses on the Piazza . He felt that lie needed a holiday . He felt , too , much more a man of the workd since his experience on the mainland . The idea for the comedy was excellent , but it would lose nothing by being kept in reserve . Actually the thought that Maritza Venier by now was back in Venice occurred to him much more often that The Sham Gallant . And yet it did not occur to him that the very thought of Maritza night have more to do with the mooning and the wardrobe and the holiday than anything else . For , whether she was back or not , what difference did it make ? He felt sure that she despised him and , this being so , he ought to take his mother 's advice and forget her . IIe ought to forget her in any case . As Jeanne had pointed out , the prospect was hopeless . He had nothing to offer even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet and commend himself to her84 85father . He could only dangle and pine . No , it was hopeless . He must not be a fool . But if he loitered so often along the Merceria and other busy streets or if , at the coffeehouse , instead of reading newspapers , he preferred to watch the passers-by under the arcades of the Piazza , it was not just the shops and the people that accounted for it . Soon or late , every Venetian passed through that section of the city . What harm if he had happened to catch a glimpse of her ? And if finally , out for a stroll one afternoon , he found himself at the Rialto , it meant nothing that he turned in the direction of San Toma and the Frescada Canal . As well walk there as anywhere . It was only incidental that he would see where she lived . But he had dressed himself up too fine for a summer walk through Venice . From the Rialto , one reached the San Toma district by way of the Campo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , narrow passagesouth . To Richard , it was a relatively unfamiliar quarter , and he asked his way more than once until finally , threading an alleylikestreet , he paused at the near end of a bridge that arched the Rio Frescada . Here a three-story brick building on his left formed an angle with the street and the canal . Since , though time-worn and crumbling , it was obviously a private house , whereas the one at his right across the alley served for shops and lodgings , this must be the Venier palazzo which had been described to him . On the street side , it was dour and unrevealing enough . Only a squat service entrance broke the expanse of the wall . But the canal front of it , viewed from the arch of the bridge , made a wholly different impression . Its long facade , the Gothic doorway , balconiesand windows , mirrored in the water beneath , ensured its right to be called a palazzo . In contrast , facing it across the thirtyfoot-widecanal , rose the wall of a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut loading doors and lofts . As compared with the closeness of the street , it seemed cooler here . An emerald shadow cast by the palace darkened the water down from the bridge ; and a slight curve of the canal at that point formed , as it were , a separate nook in the closely built quarter , which gave a sense of retirement and almost of solitude . To this , the weathered brick walls of the palace , the crumbling tracery of its windows , the cluster of decayed mooring posts , draped in seaweed , that stood lapped by the canal at one side of the main doorway , contributed . It was a spot haunted by the peace of age , twilight and seclusion . Richard Ieaned absently against the parapet of the bridge . So here it was , the place where Maritza Venier lived . But the sight of it did not seem to bring her any closer to him . On the contrary , he found it difficult to reconcile his thought of her with the medieval remoteness of the old building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms above the arch of the portal . Indeed , at the moment , he could hardly believe that it was inhabited by anyone . It gave the feeling of emptiness . Not a sound came from within . The lower windows had been boarded up , and those above them looked vague and vacant . One could gather that the heavy door between its wasted stone columns bad not been opened for a long time . Perhaps , after all , no one lived here , and lie had mistaken the street . The Venier palazzo might he further up or down the canal . Trying to make out the actual arms on the scutcheon above the door , he found it impossible to read the worn carving at that distance , and so , turning back across the bridge , he walked along the fondarnenta , or stone coping of the canal bank , which led to the marble landing block in front of the entrance . From that point , the almost obliterated crest was perfcetly visible . No , there had been no mistake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were still faintly apparent across the weathered shield . And now what ? He gave iip deluding himself about the good clothes he was wearing and the real object of his walk . The hope of seeing not only Maritza 's house but , somehow or other , of seeing Maritza herself had to be acknowledged  --  as well as his disappointmentthat the better half of that hope seemed impossible . He stood vainly looking up at the empty windows and balconies . Not a sound , not a flicker of life . For a moment , he felt an insane impulse to lift the heavy ring-knocker hanging from the mouth of a bronze lion 's head on the door . But the notion was too mad to be indulged . Unconventional as the Veniers might be , they were not unconventional enough to allow an almost complete stranger to call on the daughter of the house , even if Richard had been in her good graces . He would have to give it up and trudge home again , fineclothes and all . There was no use kicking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the expedient of a serenade , hire a gondola and some musicians . But he was on no such footing with Maritza as that . Then , too , it meant the reversal of his decision not to make love to her . And yet  --  to hell with prudence and pretenses ! He suddenly admitted to himself that he was damnably in love with her . Standing with his back to the palace and staring absently across the canal , he became gradually conscious of a small object in the water , which at last drew his attention . Too big for a rat , it turned out to be a young puppy , which had no doubt drifted down under the bridge and , swimming feebly , was scratching in vain for a purchase on the vertical stone foundation of the warehouse . That it had been destined to drown was shown by the string trailing behind its neck , from which the weight had dropped off . But this fate had been only delayed and was now closing in . Richard viewed the struggle with rising concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boyhood had fought many a battle with fellow street urchins to protect some tortured cur that had fallen into their hands . It was one of his recognized weaknesses , perhaps deriving from his own insecurity . The Venetian small boys had poked fun at him for it but had learned to respect it . Now at once he became involved in the puppy 's distress ; for if the little creature could not be detached from that impossible landingplace , it was surely finished . Stooping down , he whistled and called , hoping that the puppy would swim over so that he could fish it out . But the frantic scratching went on . Unless some casual gondola appeared , he had no way of reaching the little dog except by going into the water after it himself . And yet here he was in a new suit which had cost him ten sequins . He glanced rapidly up and down the canal , but no boat was in sight . Maladetto ! . . . The puppy fought on , scrabbled against the wall , disappeared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Coraggio , piccino ! " Richard shouted . Off went his hat , coat and waistcoat , cravat and shirt . He added his shoes to the heap , stripped off his stockings , and slipped into the water . After all , if his nankeen breeches were ruined , it would be no great loss. 86 87 The distance was not more than ten yards , but he arrived only in time to grasp the limp little animal , which resigned itself to the big hand closing over it . The question then arose what to do next . He could not climb out on this side of the canal , which was lined by the warehouse . On the other hand , it might not be feasible to regain the bank in front of the palace , because it was low tide and the water level made it difficult for a swimmer to catch a hand- hold on the coping . The best plan was to swim up to the bridge , where a couple of steps led down to the water . But turning in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whistling , calling and splashing had made more noise than he realized . To his astonishment , the door of the palace stood open and , more amazing still , no less a person than Maritza herself was watching him from the landing block . Evidently she had not recognized the half-naked swimmer with his hair plastered flat on his head and a puppy in one hand . She called heartily : " Bravo , sior ! That was gallant of you . Is he all right ? Swim over here and hand him to use . Then I 'll help you up . " But a face like Richard 's was unmistakable . Her voice faded out . She stared . " You ? Sior Morandi ? " Richard would have liked to sink from sight . To be meeting her again this way , almost stripped , bobbing about in the dirty canal , and burdened with an absurd puppy was so unromantically the re- verse of anything he had pictured that his thought collapsed . As he swam nearer , he managed to get out : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . . . please excuse me . . . ' A little flushed , she kneeled on the landing block and , reaching her arm down at full length , took the puppv from Richard 's up- stretched hand . The little dog trembled and dripped beside her on the pavement . " Poveretto , " she said , patting it . Then , reaching down again , " Now for you , sior . Take hold . " He hesitated . " Thank you . I 'll swim rip to the bridge . " " Do n't be silly .  --  There ! " Her hand felt capable and firm . " Now ! " Ordinarily nothing would have been easier . A tug on her part , an extra kick on his , and he would have caught the edge of the cop- ing . But neither of them counted on the slipperiness of the land- 88 ing block . His weight drew her forward ; her knees slid on the worn marble ; he heard a despairing Santa Maria ! and down she plunged on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't swim . " Her arm clamped itself about Richard 's neck and submerged him again . " Take it easy , " he puffed . " Put your hand on my shoulder . " At once her arm relaxed . Her face was streaked with hair and water , but she managed to smile . " La perdoni . .. " " Perdoni ? " he returned . " It 's all my fault . Clumsy fool ! " Completehumiliation swept over him . He told himself that this was certainly the end . A grand finale ! Nakedness and the puppy were bad enough , but dragging Maritza into the canal left nothing to add . There could be no forgiveness for that in earth or heaven . " Che gonzo ! " He threw in other phrases of choice Venetian . " Sior ! " she reproved . " Hush ! How are we going to get out ? " A hurry of footsteps sounded from the palace doorway . An aggrievedvoice rose , calling on the saints . Looking up , Richard saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , seethingdown at them . " Misery ! What 's happened ? My poor darling ! Is he trying to assassinate you ? Aha ! Bandit ! " Maritza put in : " Quiet , Anzoletta . He 's not a bandit . Stoop down and give us a hand , but do n't slip .  --  And look out for thepu PPY . " " What puppy ? " " There  --  in front of you . " With a disgusted glance at the shivering object , the woman leaned over and caught Maritza 's hand . A pull of her stout arm , a push underneath from Richard , shot the girl up like a cork . A second later she was on her feet . " Thanks , Anzoletta . You 're better at it than I am . Now help Sior Morandi . " " How ! You know the fellow ? " " Of course I do . It 's Sior Morandi , the gentleman I told you about , at the Villa Bagnoli  --  remember ?  --  Count Roberto . " " Count Roberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looks like a Moor and a pirate . With my own eyes , I saw him pull you in . " Maritza protested . " No , he did n't . It was just an accident . Please hurry ! " Dubious and reluctant , Anzoletta gave the needed tug , and Richard clambered to a sitting position on the coping . He hardly dared stand up . The cotton breeches , grown almost transparent with their soaking , clung to him like tights and offered little concealment . His one thought now was to snatch up the rest of his clothes and vanish at the first possible moment . Fortunately Anzoletta , whose alarm had turned to scolding , concentrated on Maritza at the moment and left Richard in the background . Look at that dress ! A ruin . Did they have money to throw into the canal ? But this was the least of it . That a girl of family , a girl of rank , the daughter of his Excellence Antonio Venier , should run out of doors bareheaded to throw herself at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was such behavior as Anzoletta had never seen the like of ! It was behavior that deserved an oldfashionedwhacking . And Maritza could make up her mind to it ! The housekeeper of the Veniers spoke the dialect of Friuli and looked as if she belonged to the class of well-to-do peasants on the mainland , but no doubt she had spent most of her life in the Veniers ' service . Her tone of authority indicated that she had gradually become the incarnation of that family , its mainspring and dictator . Brown-eyed , square-faced , she radiated energy and , just then , indignation . Richard felt sorry for Maritza . The girl stood downcast and dripping under the lecture . " And worse still , there you stand catching cold ... " At this point , an inquisitive gondola drifted by , but the boatmanprudently confined himself to stares . Anzoletta lowered her voice until he was past . " And now in with you ! Fraschetta ! I forbid you to touch that smelly little dog ! " But Maritza picked up the puppy and cuddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , get into the house at least . " " And Sior Morandi ? We ca n't leave him out here . " Richard put in : " Do n't think about me , madonna . Again , please forgive  --  " Anzoletta cut him short . He was amazed at a sudden relenting in her eyes . " Of course you 'll come in . You can dry off in the kitchen . If we do that much for a dog , we can do it for a human . I wo n't have you on my conscience . " She propelled Maritza not too gently toward the door , but the girl turned to nod at him and again smiled . It was the smile she had given him that first night in return for the camellias . " Well , are you coming ? " Anzoletta demanded from the threshold . " Hurry up . Do n't forget your things . " So induced , Richard gathered up his clothes and , conscious of his nudity , slunk , rather than walked , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his entrance into the Palazzo Venier could hardly have been sorrier . Still , one way or another , here he was . The door closed with a boom behind him . XIIIAS in other mansions of its age , the front door of the Palazzo Venier opened upon a vaulted passage , or entrada , that led into a central court around which the mass of the house was built . Here an outer staircase supported by Gothic arches and flanked by a richly carved parapet rose to the second floor . In the middle of the court , like a marble hub , stood the inevitable well resembling the huge capital of a column and bearing the arms of the family on its sides . At one time , in the days of the merchant princes , the palace must have been a very splendid dwelling . Remnants of its past magnificencewere obvious in the fine and spacious proportions of the courtyard , in the delicate arches of the second-story arcade that gave access to the rooms on that level , and in the exquisite , though worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building which had been so apparent on the outsidewas equally advanced here . Occasional weeds pushed up between the flagstones of the court ; some windows of the upper 90 91floors had lost their panes and showed various makeshifts for keeping out the weather ; lizards sunned themselves on the fallen brickwork that lined the base of the walls . It was a crumbling and neglect that implied poverty as well as age . Maritza had withdrawn somewhere to change and had taken the puppy with her . Conducted by Anzoletta , Richard crossed the courtyard to the kitchen , a vast stone-paved region with blackenedbeams and a cavernous hearth which might once have turned out banquets for a hundred guests . Now only the embersof a tiny charcoal fire gave a point of light in the dusk . " Put your clothes down there , " said the housekeeper , indicating a rough-hewn oak table . " And you 'd better wash yourself off well in that tub . You 'll find some buckets of fresh water next to it . The canal 's pretty foul at low tide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . What made you do it ? " Shamefacedly , Richard explained . " More heart than head , " observed Anzoletta . " Still , I do n't know that it is n't more to your credit than the other way round . " Richard could see that it was hard for her to conceal the warm kindliness under her crusty manner . " I suppose what you need now , " she went on , " is breeches . While you 're washing up , I 'll find you a pair of his Excellence 's . " She brought him a clean but well-worn towel and disappeared . It was a cold bath in the clammy twilight . Richard rubbed himselfhard afterwards to get warm . Luckily he had slipped on his shirt and was drying his hair when Anzoletta returned ; but that he still lacked a good deal in point of dress did not seem to trouble her . " Ilere , " she said , holding out a garment . " Isis Excellence insists that you wear these . They 're pretty elegant  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great occasions  --  the last time at the Siora 's funeral . " Richard thanked her and handled the breeches reverently , but he began to have misgivings when he drew them on . They had surely been elegant once , but they were cut for a smaller and shorter man , and time had so frayed the material that it seemed unlikely to hold against any new stress . Ite pointed this out tactfullyto Anzoletta , with the private thought that he did not want to be blamed for damaging an heirloom. 92 " Well , " she decided , " it ca n't be helped . Wear them anyway . I doubt if his Excellence will need them again , and they 'd fetch nothing if sold . I 'd have brought others , but the truth is  --  " She left the truth unrevealed . " Even if they tear , " she added , " I hope they 'll cover the essentials . " Moving warily , Richard hoped so , too . The breeches did not come to his knees . He rolled up his stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight and needed watching . Luckily the long skirts of his plum-colored coat would cover a good deal . And now at last  --  what with the coat and his flowered linen waistcoat , frilled shirt , snowy neckcloth , white stockings , and silver shoe buckles  --  his handsome new clothes came into their own . His black hair ribbon had lost its crisp bow and dangled a little ; but , except for that , no sign of the canal remained . Anzoletta , visibly impressed , righted her cap and smoothed out her apron . " I did n't know you were such a fine gentleman , " she conceded . " You must n't mind what I said outside there . You 'll have to admit that you were n't looking your best . " " I hope not , " said Richard . Half from vanity , he drew out one of his recently acquired snuffboxes , which he offered with a bow . " Do you take tobacco , Sior ' Amia ? " Even if Anzoletta had not been the Veniers ' prime minister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had been a little too forward in calling her aunt . " Siora is enough , " she corrected , and then sugared the reproof by accepting a pinch of snuff . " Excellent . Real Seville . It 's been a long time since I had any . And I thank you . " Richard took a pinch himself with the reflection that their relations had been very deftly established . Anzoletta was favorable tentatively and up to a point , but she did not fully commit herself . " His Excellence , " she went on in the manner of one speaking for a sovereign , " invites you to have coffee with him and the Lady Maritza in the roof pavilion . " And with a view perhaps of dashing any too-hasty ideas on Richard 's part , " As I told him , it was only proper under the circumstances , much as he hates to leave his desk . " " I hope it is n't too great an intrusion , siora . " " No , not that . It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pry him loose , and he 's happy enough . But you 've got to93pry him . So , if you 'll take a seat on that bench or wait in the courtyard . . . Leaving Richard to his thoughts , she sparingly added a few charcoalsto the fire , set a coffeepot to boil , and assembled some odds and ends of china on a pewter tray . Richard watched her absently . He was more than a little nervous about the approaching meeting with the Veniers . What would come of it ? Was it to be a beginning or an end ? Would he be able to re-establish himself with Maritza ? What kind of man was Antonio Venier ? " How did you happen to be outside our palazzo ? " queried the housekeeper suddenly , with a shrewdness which was not lost on him . Improvising , he mixed some truth in the reply . On an errand in San Tomb parish , he had happened to cross the Rio Frescada and had stopped to admire the Palazzo Venier , all the more as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you always dress so fine when you walk through the city ? " " I had a call to make . " But the woman 's shafts were falling too close for comfort . Anzoletta removed the pot from the fire and transferred it to the tray . " You 're sure her Excellence knew nothing about it ? She 's spoken of you more than once . Looks rather pat to me . " " Indeed not , siora . " There was one comfort in this catechism : that Maritza had spoken of him , and , it seemed , not too disparagingly , or the woman would not have suspected connivance on her part . Once more Anzoletta adjusted her cap , then lifted the tray . " Let me carry it , " Richard offered . " I should say not ! Guests in our palace do n't carry trays . But you can open the door for me . " So , embodying in herself a vanished retinue of servants , Anzoletta marched rigidly out into the courtyard , and Richard followed . " Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer stairway . " They 're broken in places . " It was not only the steps that were broken . Along the arcade of the floor above , Richard stumbled once or twice on the pave-94ment , from which tiles had worked loose . Here and there , as they passed , he glanced through the windows of unfurnished , tomblike apartments , with the frescoes half peeled off from a wall or ceiling . One could guess that the furniture had been sold piece by piece to pay debts or meet living expenses . The place had that forlorn look about it . Pausing in front of a door at the foot of an inside staircase leadingto the third story , Anzoletta knocked . " Zelenza , coffee is served . " There was no answer . " Coffee , Zelenza ! " " Go away , " came a muffled voice . " Leave me in peace . Va via . . . She knocked again . " We have a guest , remember . Sior Morandi . He awaits your Excellence . " A sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . One moment . My respects to the gentleman . . . One moment . " She shrugged . " There you have it . The Muses . Let 's go on up . I think he 'll be along presently . If not , I 'll come back and fetch him . " She led the way to the third floor , which contained another file of vacant rooms once occupied by servants , and then up a last short flight to the vacancy of the roof . Emerging into the glare of afternoon from the twilight below , Richard stood dazzled an instant , half-conscious of the city spread out below and around him . " Finalmente ! " exclaimed a nearby voice . " Sior , you certainly take time to dress ! " An altana , or open pavilion built of tiles , lay several paces distantacross the roof . In the doorway stood Maritza , her wet hair covered by a tightly bound scarf , with the puppy , a ball of yellow fur , in the angle of one arm . Richard put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The most devoted servant of the Siora . " Dropping him as deep a curtsy as the encumbrance of the puppy allowed , she copied his greeting . " The most humble servant of Sior Morandi . " He flushed and stiffened . It reminded him of her mockery in the ballroom of the villa . They seemed to be back at that point , as if the adventure in the canal had never happened. 95He forgot manners and blurted out : " Why are you offended , madonna ? What 's wrong ? " " Nothing . I suppose it must be hard to get over being Count Roberto . " " You do n't like Count Roberto ? " " I like Sior Miler better . I do n't think Count Roberto would have jumped into the canal to save a little creature like this . " She glanced warmly at the puppy . " A fop does n't do that kind of thing . " Then suddenly her expression changed . IIer eyes quickened and danced . " And I 'm sure Count Roberto would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stockings up . " Richard looked down . A widening zone of bare thigh showed betweenbreeches and hose . Worse still , his elaborate bow had started a gap in the frail silk , that ran several inches up . Good God ! And he had been displaying his manners in that condition . Plum-colored coat above , disgrace below . With a strangled sound , he stooped over and jerked the stockings into place . It seemed fated that whenever he came near Maritza something ridiculous or humiliating happened . Anzoletta , who had understood nothing of this but had listened with growing disapproval , now came to his defense and swung into action like a ship of the line . " Sior Morandi , " she said , advancing into the altana and setting down the tray with a thump on the small center table , " I hope you 'll forgive this vanerella , who seems to be bent on disgracing herself and the family . I have tried to teach her politeness , but you see the result .  --  As for you , povera gnocca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " arc not even you ashamed ? Che sesti ! Has a guest ever been so received at the Palazzo Venier ! The gentleman greets you courteously ; you make fun of him . He asks how he has offended you ; you call him a fop  --  " " No , Anzoletta , I did n't . " " Permit me to believe my own ears . And then , to cap everything , you laugh at his dress . Is it his fault that your father 's breeches are too short for him ? Is that a topic for a lady ? Do ladies point and jeer at such things ? I marvel at you . " " I did n't point . " Maritza 's face was crimson . " I 'm sorry ! Sior , I 'm very sorry ! I did n't mean ... " 96Now that the tables were turned , Richard sympathized with her . " Of course not , madonna . I 'm happy you like me better than Count Roberto . But , really , I did n't intend . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do anything to please you . " He broke off again . " I 'm afraid these stockings just wo n't stay up . " " Puffeta ! " said Maritza . " As if it mattered ! " She explained to Anzoletta . " You do n't understand . Sior Morandi and I had a little  --  a disagreement at the Villa . He was so grand and popular , that I thought . . Well , I was cross and not very nice to him . So just now , when he made me such a fine reverence and talked about devoted servant , I could n't help making fun again . It 's a little mixed up . .. " Richard had the feeling of a boatman who , having barely squeezed past the reefs , enters harbor . He would avoid those particular reefs , he decided , from now on . As far as Maritza was concerned , the man of fashion could be dropped from his repertoire . Anzoletta glanced back and forth between them . " Mixed up , indeed ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're too young to be cross and saucy . You should wait for that till you 're married . I never did approve of your going alone to the Villa Bagnoli . And I was right . " Fondling the puppy , Maritza drew fire in another direction . " Do n't let that dirty little dog lick your face , " continued the woman , " What do you intend to do with him ? " " You mean with Bapi ? Do n't you think Bapi is a good name , Sior Miler ? " And when Richard nodded approval , " We need a watchdog , Anzoletta . " The housekeeper did not intend to submit without an effort . " Tole , " she declared , " you can choose between that dog and me . I have enough to care for without that . " " Darling ! I 'll take care of him . " " Nonsense ! I 've heard that before . " " I promise . " " Your promises ! Who will clean up after this Bapi ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . Which brings fleas . Have n't we fleas enough ? " " But , cara , a few more . . . " " And who will feed him ? I , Anzoletta. " 97 " Vecchia , no . I 'll feed him myself . " " That 's what you say . " " Cara ti .. The pleading was irresistible . Anzoletta succumbed . " You see how it is . " She turned to Richard . " A spoiled minx . " " Exactly ! " put in a voice from the doorway . " So much for Maritza ! " Richard looked around , half startled , at a figure entering the pavilion . " You 're Sior Miler , I believe , " said the newcomer with a smile very much like Maritza 's . " I 've heard of you often since my daughter 's return from the Villa Bagnoli . It is a pleasure to welcome you . I am Antonio Venier . " XIVAS Richard returned Venier 's greeting and sat down at the coffee table with him and Maritza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately at ease . Venier looked about fifty . he had a short and slight , though well-proportioned , figure . The mark of recently removedspectacles crossed the bridge of his nose . Because of the warm day , he had left off his coat , retaining only the long waistcoat , which was half unbuttoned across his shirt . But , for all that , the whiteness of his linen and his well-tended hands gave him a distinguished appearance . Remarkable , too , was the vivacity of his brown eyes , changeable , vivid and extremely eloquent . From the rescue of the puppy , with laughter on Venier 's part and apologies on Richard 's , conversation turned naturally to the latter 's meeting with Maritza at the Widiin , m villa . " My daughter tells me , " said Venier , " that von arc a musician , an actor , a writer of plays and a friend of Carlo Goldoni 's . For so young a man , I call that a great deal . Few at your age have so many titles of distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Richard answered , " they are titles without the distinction , your Excellence . As to music and me , the less said the better . As to acting and writing , perhaps some day  --  " He finished the sentence with a shrug . Maritza put in : " Sior Pa 're , he 's just being modest . Dr. Goldoni himself told me all about the play that Sior Morandi wrote calledCaptain Harlequin . He said it was the best commedia dell ' arte he had seen in a long time . And , of course , everybody at the villa went mad about the way he acted Count Roberto . " " Except you , madonna , " Richard observed . She colored a little . " Well , you know I admired it . I told you so . It was only  --  But please do n't let 's talk about it any more . " " I should say not ! " exclaimed Anzoletta , who sat knitting in the background . " She 's been very pert , your Excellence . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him to keep a guest at the center of conversation . " Are you writing something now , Sior Morandi ? " It struck Richard that here was an excellent chance to put The Sham Gallant to use . " As it happens , I am , " he answered , supplying the will for the deed . " And I think the plot , at least , is unusual . It occurred to me at the Villa Bagnoli . " " Tell us about it , " urged Venier . " Please ! " said Maritza , leaning forward . What Richard told , with a due substitution of names and comic exaggeration , was of course the story of himself on the Brenta . As he portrayed them , the characters of Maritza , Tromba , the Countess , and Sagredo , could hardly be identified by Venier and Anzoletta ; whereas almost at once Maritza gave him a sharp glance , then smiled , then bit her lips . Under the guise of fiction and keeping a steady face , he could pay Maritza , as Rosaura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could do nothing to stop him . On the other hand , while ridiculing himself as Harlequin , the Sham Gallant , he pleaded his own case . The complications of the plot had been well enough thought out ; and , as he described them , the actor in him took over . Venier was delighted ; Anzoletta held her sides . Maritza , vexed , pleased and embarrassed , could not keep from laughing , too . In the end , Harlequin , having been sufficientlybaited , exposed , and made fun of , received his sentence from the charming heroine . " Bravo ! " Venier applauded , while Anzoletta echoed him . " Comedy in the best tradition , Sior Morandi . " Only Maritza , drawing imaginary lines on the table with her forefinger , said nothing . " How do you like it , madonna ? " Richard asked after a moment . 98 99Her smile had its own special meaning . " I think you 're very clever , sior . But I do n't like the heroine . I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Maritza smiled again , enchantingly this time . Whether The Sham Gallant ever got written or not , it had been successful . Conscious that Venier had kept him too much in the forefront of the talk , Richard now sought to step back . " Would it be indiscreet , Zelenza , to ask about your own work ? I understand that you are writing a great poem on Venice , but Siora Maritza did not tell me enough . Comedies are such froth compared with  --  " " Not at all , " put in Venier hurriedly , " not at all . I wish you 'd explain to me why the Granellesca Academy is so much at outs with Goldoni . " " Is n't that always the way ! " Anzoletta interrupted . " Ask the Lustrissimo anything about his own writing , and he 's off , like an eel . Who cares about the What-you-call-it Academy ? " Maritza joined in . " It 's true , Sior Pa 're . Whv do you behave like that ? " " Behave like what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an epic poem , " she insisted . " Was that right ? " " No , not entirely . . . philosophical rather . . . But , Sior Morandi  --  " " In the manner of Lucretius ? " llichard asked . " No , a philosophy of history . Very long-winded . And now let us  --  " " Nol " said Maritza . " What do you mean by a philosophy of his-tory ? " Venier sighed . " The causes underlying events , piccina . The forces of life and death in nations . Our Republic of Venice has had its day , has reached the end . But our age everywhere is closing . Why ? That 's the theme . " Out of respect for Venier , Richard did not smile , but the terms seemed extravagant . What end had Venice reached ? Her empire might have shrunk since the days of colonial greatness , but it still persisted on the mainland , on the coasts across the Adriatic . Her fleets were still a power in the Mediterranean , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out now over the sparkle of the city to feel its continued , immemorial life . The unbridled100horses still proclaimed the spirit of Venice above the portal of St. Mark 's . The lion stood guard upon his column in the Piazzetta . On Ascension Day , the gilded Bucentaur carried the Doge in state to the annual wedding of the sea . Richard thought of the wealth and display he had seen on the Brenta or here in the city , the pomp and lavishness of the all-powerful patricians . An end of Venice ? And what about mighty France , imperial Spain and Austria , bustling England ? It all looked pretty solid . " The end ? " Richard repeated . " Yes . But call it what you like : the last phase . All signs point to it . " " What signs does your Signory mean ? " Venier hesitated . " I 'm a philosopher , not a preacher . But let me ask you a question . What is the official religion of Europe ? " " Why , sir , Christianity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual religion of Europe  --  I mean the faith by which men live and for which they are willing to die ? " Unused to such discussions , Richard could only blink . " Well , then , " said Venier , " put it this way . Do most people practice Christianity nowadays or do they practice worldliness ? " " The latter , sir ; but has n't that always been so ? " " Yes , but with a great difference . It 's a question of degree . Christianity did not become the official religion of Europe merely on the strength of lip service . Such words as charity , repentance , and honor once had a real meaning . They reflected an integrity , a spiritual core , which has vanished . And I am one who holds that the spirit is more than meat ; that a man , a nation , a millenium , grows and is strong , or declines and perishes , in proportion to the spiritual content of each . But when nothing spiritual remains , what is left to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present world .  --  But these are deep waters . " Deep indeed , thought Richard , who was very much at a loss . " Did n't you have a letter yesterday from Monsieur Diderot in Paris ? " suggested Maritza , proudly intent on drawing out her father . " You know who Monsieur Diderot is , Sior Miler . He 's writingan inclopedia . " " Encyclopedia , cara , " murmured Venier. 101 " Well , anyway , he 's a very learned man , and he agrees with you , does n't he , Father ? " " Yes , in part . At least he prophesies the end of France , as we know it , within the next generation . " " But how ? " Richard exclaimed . The idea of this was even more incredible than the end of Venice . The power of France , the prestigeof France , overshadowed Europe . " Surely , " he added , " England and the King of Prussia are n't doing so well in the present war as to bring that about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire with Russia . " " Not by war , " said Venier . " Diderot means revolution . There 's too much misery in France , too much corruption , and too much new thought , for the present state of things to last . But revolutionis contagious . It will not be confined to France ; it will spread through the world . " The click of Anzoletta 's needles sounded a moment . " Do you believe in revolution , Zelenza ? " she asked suddenly . He took so long to answer that she glanced up from her knitting . " No , " he said at last , " for revolution mixes too much falsehood with too little truth . Like war , it sells its soul for a mirage . But like war , too , and like other plagues , it clears the ground for the future  --  perhaps a better future , who can tell ? I 'm always doubtful , though , of bad means to a good end . " He smiled reminiscently . " When I think of revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to meet around Venice fifteen years back . He was secretary to the French ambassador , Monsieur de Montaigu ; but he was too thin-skinned to hold the position long and gave it up . Since then , he 's done well in the literary way . I hear he 's quite a lion in Paris . A Genevan by the name of Rousseau . " " I think I 've heard of him , " put in Richard . " Ile wrote an intermezzocalled Le Devin du Village that Dr. Goldoni admires . " " Yes , " nodded Venier , " and an essay on the arts and sciences which was much talked about . He dabbles in music , education , government , or what you will . He 's one of Diderot 's encyclopedists . But the point of mentioning him is that he has the kind of ideas which cause revolution . " Venier shook his head . " To my mind , he 's a thoroughly detestable fellow . And yet that makes no102difference . For thoughts are like fire that can burn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maritza drew her chair closer to the table . " What ideas , Sior Pa 're ? " " A few excellent ones . I confess that Monsieur Rousseau had something to do with your education or lack of it , fia mia  --  though perhaps it would have been the same in any case , because your mother and I were natural rebels . " Venier turned to Richard . " Of course you 've noticed that my daughter has no bringing-up at all , that she 's a perfect barbarian according to genteel standards . No savoir-faire , no polish . Look at her now with her elbows on the table ! " Maritza removed them and tried to look chastened . It was the moment for a compliment ; but before Richard could think of the right words , Anzoletta expressed herself on the subject of Monsu Rousseau . She could see no advantage in being a barbarian and ignorant of polite customs . How often she had pointed this out to his Excellence and to the dear dead Siora ! How often she had worked upon Maritza herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all because of said Monsu . She could well understand that he was the apostle of revolution . Venier leaned back with relief at being out of the conversation . But he did not escape ; for when the gale was over Maritza again asked : " What ideas were those , Father  --  I mean the ones you liked ? " And Richard seconded her . " Well , " continued Venier , " for example , when he used to discuss the silliness and bother of most of our conventions  --  how contrarythey are to nature and how much more honestly we could live without them  --  I agreed with him .  --  Yes , Anzoletta ; you can say what you please .  --  Furthermore , when Monsieur Rousseau urged that emotion , that warmth of heart , should not be stifled by prudence and reason , I agreed with him , too . Then , besides , he had a novel conception of beauty , which has meant much to me as a poet . He finds grandeur in mountains and desert solitudes , in aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he is right . " " Why do you call him detestable , then ? " Maritza objected . " First , because of his personal self , which is vain , sickly and103unbalanced . He is forever wronged and a martyr . He is a petty man of mean passions . But this would not be important if he were not so dangerous . For he has great persuasiveness ; and the world is full of men like him , men with a grievance , to whom he tells not the truth but what he and they like to believe . That 's what I meant by the falsehood back of revolution . Ile preaches , for instance , that all men are equal . " " Are n't they , " said Maritza , " in the eyes of God ? " " Perhaps . Only God can say . " Richard suggested : " I remember reading somewhere , your Excellence , that laws should be the same for everybody without respect to rank . Does n't Rousseau mean that ? " " Yes , in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ignorant , the envious , and the oppressed , equality is sure to have the meaning that one man is as good as the next , deserves as much as the next ; that there are no superior , no inferior , men . Which is nonsense . But the lie is so flattering , offers such promise , that the multitude is sure to welcome it . It is apt even to replace the religionthat we have lost . There 's the fire which will consume our age . But when it has leveled everything , fire burns itself out , and so does a lie . " " Does your Signory think  --  " Venier raised his hand . " No , I beg . You 've had enough of my opinions . What I really think at the moment regards supper . I hope you will join us , Sior Morandi , if you are free . " " Please do , " Maritza urged . On the point of gratefully accepting , Richard stopped short at a warning sound from Anzoletta . It was half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It signaled distress . Venier laughed . " What ! No supper , Anzoletta ? " " Lustrissimo , not much . " " La bela cossa ! We have soup ? " " Yes , a little . " " Put water in it . Bread ? " " Thank God , yes . " " Well ! " . . . Venier 's tone expressed opulence . " Wine ? " Almost at the point of tears , Anzoletta burst out : " Your Excellenceknows that we have only the little half bottle that was left from dinner . " 104 " Ample ! " he declared . " Do we need a barrel ? Water is again indicated  --  and temperance . " Richard put in : " I thank your Signories , but the fact is I 'm engaged . . . I must . . . Maritza laid a hand on his arm . " You see ! " Venier smiled . " We wo n't let you off . Do n't lead me to believe that you scorn our menu . Soup ! Bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry up the banquet . It 's after sundown . Let 's feast here under the stars . And while you 're making ready , I 'll show Sior Morandi the palace . " XVTHERE was not much to see , after all ; but each empty apartment and dim gallery , indeed almost every stone , it seemed to Richard , had its story ; and Venier , fond of the past , mingled fact with legend , as they strolled about . However , it was the study that detainedthem longest . Unlike the other rooms , it contained a clutter of odds and ends , an inundation of hooks , a vast writing tablelittered with manuscripts , broken quills , clay pipes and tobacco crumbs , that stood beneath one of the high Gothic windows now pale in the light of evening . At the writing table , Venier displayed the manuscript of his poem , a bulky pile of closely written folio pages . " But it must be a vast work , your Excellence , " Richard exclaimed . " No , what you see here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now beginning the eighth . " " Has your Signory any idea when you will finish it ? " " Not the least . Probably never . I 've already been working on it fifteen years . Besides , I should never dare publish it . The Council of Ten finds any idea of political change treasonable .  --  But here  --  " a sudden thought occurred to him , and he dragged out another sheaf of manuscript from under a pile of cascading books  --  " is something else . " In spite of the dim light , Richard could make out a heavily inked title  --  Theseus , an Opera  --  and recalled that Maritza had spoken of librettos which her father had written . It was a form that Rich-105and knew more about than philosophical poetry . His interest quickened . Turning over the pages , he saw another title , Oenone . " I wrote those long ago , " said Venier , " at the desire of my wife . Indeed , we wrote them together . Maritza has told you , I believe , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished , very beautiful . " His voice shook suddenly , and he paused . " She withdrew from the stage when we were married , but she alwayslooked back to it . So these plays were written . " He made a pretense of stacking up the tumbled hooks . " Would you permit me to read them ? " asked Richard . Venier nodded . " Sometime , if you have leisure , I should value your opinion . The style is romantic , rather high-flown perhaps ; but I used to believe the plays had merit . My wife designed the ballets for them . She and Maritza would go through the figures and imaginethemselves dancing at the San Giangrisostorno . It was pretty to watch . . . " If the plays had been the heaviest Latin tome on the surroundingshelves , Richard would have been charmed to read them because of the pretext they offered of returning to the Palazzo Venier . He expressed his sense of obligation at the privilege and hoped that his Excellence would allow him to read them soon . Venier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appearing at the door , announced slipper . " No , Sior Pa 're , you can smoke afterwards . The soup is hot , and so is Anzoletta . Please come at once . " " Between the two of them , " sighed Venier , " I have no more to say than a post . " He waved Richard to precede him . And the three of them climbed up again to the roof pavilion . By this time , the suave Venetian evening had deepened . There was no moon as yet , but the stars grew momently brighter and more far-flung . An aromatic breath from the sea replaced the stagnantair of afternoon . The city lanterns , one of the glories of Venice in that age of relatively unlighted streets , spread a glimmeringnetwork through the darkness . And , here and there , music , the chief expression of the city , could be heard along the waterways , voices alone or in harmony blending with guitars and violins . The tones , dispersed through distance , did not assert themselves ; 106they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scent of flowers . On the roof of the Palazzo Venier , one felt remote and yet not separated from the city , which awakened from the drowsiness of day to greet the night . Supper , thanks to Anzoletta 's resourcefulness , did not prove too meager . Afterwards Richard , afraid of outwearing his welcome , moved to leave and was more than happy to be persuaded to linger . They sat grouped about the doorway of the pavilion , the shadowy distance in front of them , Venier with his pipe , Anzoletta at one side . Maritza , seated on a cushion , sometimes leaned her head against her father 's knees . Bapi , the puppy , now completely at home , lay curled next to her , his little eyes sleepily phosphorescent in the dusk . " Did Father show you his librettos ? " Maritza asked , when conversationonce more involved the stage . " I think they 're lovely . And the ballets ! Sior Milor ! They would be ravishing . " Richard answered that he had seen and looked forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been brought to the attention of any opera director or composer . " Oh , no , " said Venier , releasing a careless puff of smoke into the night . " As I told you , they 're rather personal . I do n't want strangersthumbing over them . Of course they 'd have to he adapted to music , cut here , rearranged there . It would be distasteful to me . Besides , I have no contact with the theater . " Anzoletta spoke from the shadows . " But is n't an opera libretto worth money , Sior Morandi ? " " Yes , " Richard said . " Perhaps a hundred sequins . Well-known authors , like Metastasio or Goldoni , get that much . " " A hundred sequins ! " breathed Anzoletta . " Cospettonaccio ! Zelenza , did you hear that ? We could live six months on a hundred sequins ! " " We can live as it is . " Venier 's voice sounded abrupt and at the same time uneasy , as one who knew from experience where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go peddling my work , I wo n't exposewhat is sacred to me for money . " " But , Lustrissimo  --  " " Anzoletta , we have a guest . Please  --  " " I do n't see what a guest has to do with it , " she retorted . " We107do n't pretend that we 're well off . We could n't pretend if we wanted to . The truth is we have just enough to keep us alive . That may do for people of our age , but what of Maritza ? What of her future ? " " Che roba ! " put in the girl . " Do n't bother about me . " " I do bother . I shall continue to bother , since his Excellence is above such trifles . Here are two hundred sequins possible , a year 's keep  --  not to mention what might be earned by writing other plays . But no , his Excellence wo n't peddle his work ; it 's too sacred to sell . He prefers to write poetry for himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelenza , let the truth be said while it 's on my tongue . I think you 're deceiving yourself with this sacredness . That 's not the main point . Other great poets have n't been so squeamish . The fact is it 's easier to live with books than take knocks from people ; it 's easier to write than sell ; it 's easier to think grand thoughts than do disagreeable jobs . But the time conies when everybody with a flat purse has to spit soft and swallow bitter , as the saying is . There ! That 's how I think , and you can call inc impertinent if you wish . " The pause that usually attends outspokenness followed . Venier cleared his throat , sucked at his pipe , crossed and uncrossed his legs . Richard felt embarrassed for him , but at the same time he could see that Anzoletta had hit the mark . " Spuar dolce , e inghiotir amaro  --  yes , a true saying , " returned Venier after a moment . " And you 're right about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been since I paid you your wages ? " Indignation sounded . " If your Excellence means that I was thinking of myself  --  " " I meant nothing of the sort . " " Or that I serve this family for wages , it 's time I returned to my village . " " Nonsense ! Do n't be so prickly . It 's only that while I dream in my room , you and Maritza do the dull jobs that keep me from being a poor barnaboto living on state alms . You drudge and skimp for nothing  --  " Except love , " snapped Anzoletta . " And I permit it , " Venier ran on . " I permit it . There 's nobility ! There 's pride ! " 108 " Oh , Jesus ! " the other exclaimed . " I should n't have spoken . I did n't mean to hurt you , caro Lustrissimo benedetto . Think no more of it . I 'm only a fool . " " No , you were right ... . Remembering Richard 's presence , he broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against his knees . " Papa carol What a fuss about nothing ! " He drew his hand back and forth over her hair . " Perhaps I could find a director , " he said , " who would consent to read my librettos . But do n't you see that I 'm not the kind of man who could ever sell anything ? It will be better to give up this house . There 'll be something left over when the mortgage is paid . Only , where could we go . . . Meanwhile , an alluring idea had been developing in Richard 's mind . He recalled that when he had last seen his stepfather , Vico Morandi , the latter had been in one of his black moods with regard to the coming opera season . There were some old favorites on the list ; but the Venetian public craved novelty , and the composerdirectorhad found no librettos to please him . Here , then , might be an opening . But if not , Richard , as Venier 's agent , could peddle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in those circles and he had a ready tongue . Besides , he felt sure that he could count on Goldoni 's influence . Naturally , everything depended on how good Venier 's writing really was ; but at least  --  and this was the compelling part of the idea  --  Maritza would know that he wanted to be of service . So , interrupting at this point , he suggested the plan . IIe would consider it a great honor to be entrusted with the manuscripts . Of course he could not be certain of disposing of them . A moment of rapt silence followed . " You really mean that you would do this ? " said Venier in a low voice . " You would be so kind ? I call that the act of a true friend . " Maritza exulted . " You see , Sior Pa 're ! It wo n't be long now beforeall Venice is talking about you . Who can say that Bapi did n't bring us luck ! " And Anzoletta breathed a long-drawn " Siestu benedetto ! . . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being skinned before it was109caught . He knew what it took to squeeze money out of directors ' purses . But he kept these misgivings to himself . Maritza was alreadyat the premiere of Theseus in the San Giangrisostomo . They would be given a box . Anzoletta must buy herself a new dress . Venier , happy at being left in peace as far as the plays were concerned , indulged in one more pipe . As long as dreams were in order , Richard paid court with a new one of his own . " And the ballet ? " he put forward . " It would be wonderful , madonna , if you would consent to dance . For every reason , it would be an added attraction . You know how your mother the Siora Venier designed it ; you know all the figures . Is n't it the proper occasion for you to make your debut ? Suppose I sell the librettos , would I be permitted to suggest this to whoever buys them ? " The response exceeded anything he could have hoped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright . " Caro ti ! Would you be permitted ! " She sprang to her feet , hands outstretched towardVenier . " Sior Pa 're ! I beg . Sior Pa 're , you wo n't refuse . . . " " Nonsense ! " put in Anzoletta , but mildly , it seemed to Richard . " Sior Pa 're ! You wo n't refuse , you will let me ( lance ? " " Yes , " Venier answered at last . " Your mother would have wanted it . How could I refuse ? " At once she was on his knees , her arms abort his neck , her face pressed to his . " Papa carissimo , I 'm the happiest girl in Venice . " Then , standing up again , she hugged Anzoletta . " Oh , vecchia , think , think ! You 'll dress me for the ballet . You 'll stand in the wings when I 'm on stage . You 'll watch me ( lance at the San Giangrisostomo . " Finally she turned to Richard . " Sior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't thank you enough . . . For a moment , almost as if alone , they stood facing each other in the vague light , the glimmering distance of the city around them . She did not need to thank him ; she would not have needed to speak at all . Something more intimate than words passed between them , something that each would always remember and that words or even a touch would have diminished . But the fear that attends too sanguine hopes already descended on him . What now if he failed in regard to the librettos ? After all , the chance of success was not much more than slight . But , by God , he would not fail ; he would not even think of failing . He would move heaven and earth rather than disappoint Maritza . No knight ever went out to do battle for his lady with a fiercer resolutionthan Richard felt about the sale of Theseus and Oenone . However , Anzoletta helped him a little at that point . " Of course we 're all grateful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush , Maritzetta . Though I know  --  " her voice appealed to Richard  --  " that he 'll do his best . " " You can be sure of that , siora . " " Sior ' Amia , " she corrected . " Siora is n't enough now . " XVIVICO MORANDI , Richard 's stepfather , belonged to the class of people who are vehement about everything . He had the sensitivenessof an artist , but he had also the build , vigor and appetites of a small black bull ; so that life for him was a series of impulses usually tense and often explosive . On this hot afternoon in his study , he felt explosive about the librettos that Richard had thrust on him several clays ago and which he had neglected to read in spite of his stepson 's pestering . He considered it a damned bore . Librettists in general were a vile race , and he expected nothing from Venier , though he was vaguely curious as to what the patrician husband of the once celebrated Austrian ballerina , Elena Klahr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he at last smoothed out the manuscript of Theseus on his desk , drew up a chair , put on his spectacles , and , after a grunt or two , began reading . At such moments , in spite of irritation , the best of him graduallycame to the surface . He thought in terms of art . Scenes were visualized ; characters lived . He could hear the recitative against the monotony of the continuo instruments . Aria cadences stirred vaguely in his mind . Also he read from three different angles : how the play affected him personally ; how it fitted in with the singers and resources of his theater ; how it would suit the public . As might be expected , this poor Venier did not know much110 111about opera construction . There was his first soprano in a long recitative and aria practically at the beginning of the play , before the pit had settled down and while the loges were filling . What prima donna or leading castrate would submit to such an infliction ? There were also nine characters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't fatal . . . But here an importantaria had been given to an inferior character , an infringement of their rights which would set off rebellion among the principal actors . Apparently , too , Venier did not know that the three leadingsingers must each have five arias : two in the first and second acts , and one in the third . He did not even know that two arias cantabile and two arias di portamc.nto must not follow each other . And , glancing forward to the end , Morandi groaned . What a finale ! No provision made to bring all the characters upon the stage ; recitative where there should have been the chief airs ; no scope allowed for a proper mingling of adagio , allegro , andante , amoroso , which must conclude the opera . Venier had followed dramatic and logical rules . But they were nonsense in a performance intended merely to display the talents of a group of singers . No , from the standpoint of conventional opera , Theseus would not do . Turning to Oenone , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile was sorry . The verses sang ; the plots were gripping ; the arias , which , according to the Metastasian model , summed up each foregoing scene , were fresh and lyrical . Venier was surely a poet , and the artist in Vico acknowledged this . It was likely , too , that the public would have been pleased . But Italian opera , at that point , existed not for the public , let alone for the composer or dramatist , but for the singers . Their whims , prestige , and rivalries , were the paramount consideration . Morandi was more than sorry . Ile sat brooding about his servitudeto foolish conventions and silly virtuosi , until , as usual , he caught fire . Why was he born in such an age ! Why could he not have lived in the great days of Monteverdi and aristocratic music ! Hell 's fury blast the Neapolitan pimps who had sold out art to a set of fashionable castrates concerned only in showing off the range of their effeminate voices ! Well , there was nothing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would give himself the treat of reading good poetry . Richard's112praise of Venier 's style was justified . Metastasio himself did not write better . Vico plunged again into Theseus . But with him , reading of the kind easily transposed itself into music . For example , this lyric of Ariadne 's : Riposo dolce , pace innocente .. ( Sweet repose , innocent peace , . Happy the heart that holds you ever . . . ) deeply moved him . Tears crept into his eyes . At once a melody , tentative at first , then more assured , fitted itself to the words . His nostrils widened ; his thin lips tensed . The music , growing louder in his mind , passed to his throat . He hummed a bar or two , nodded , stood up , and , taking Theseus with him , drifted over to the clavichord . The melody now transferred itself to the instrument , took wings , developed variations in the da capo repetition , suggested the proper accompaniment . Already Vico was thinking in terms of his orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castrate soprano , Serafini . By God , this was the aria for him ! How he would fill his lungs and send those unnaturally high , thrilling , perfect tones through the house ! Wait till Serafini heard this . He would clamor for it . Aware from experience that melodies sometimes escaped unless written down , Vico reached for a pen and a blank sheet of paper beside the clavichord . But , dipping furiously , he found no ink in the well . Too intent to explode , he fetched ink from his desk , scribbled at top speed , broke one quill and snatched another . So ! That tune would not get away from him . And , being now in fettle , he leafed rapidly through the libretto to another aria which had struck him . The melody for it flowed into his mind . He had been suffering from an imaginative drought , but all at once this seemed to be over . The floodgates of music swung open . He could again create . Something in Venier 's libretto had brought release to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt this play somehow to the stage , rules or no rules . But these were side thoughts . He was busy dashing down notes on paper or tinkling them out on the clavichord . . . D-flat ; no , 113B-flat , a diminished seventh . . . ta-to-ta-ta . . . The goddess Minerva was descending on a cloud to right the wrongs of the hero- ine , Ariadne , and restore her to Theseus . She sang an aria di porta- mento of great dignity . It would be like this . Vico struck some chords and chanted : " I bring from heaven the answer to your pray- ers . . . Ecco 1a ! " " I hope you do , Babbo , " said a quiet voice in front of him . " I hope you realize by now that Theseus and Oenone are the only possible operas for the coming season . It ought to he obvious . " And , looking up from the keyboard with a start , Vico found Richard , his elbows on the clavichord case , eying him across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption sent the blood to Morandi 's head and blazed in his eyes . But almost at once it faded out . he had affection for Richard , not unntingled with regard for the latter 's theatrical talents . They were on easy , humorous terms with each other . Besides , Vico had reached the end of his vein for that time . So , he merely grinned and struck a final chord . " It 's a gruesome thing , fio mio , " he complained , " to be faced with that black phiz of yours at the end of a hard dav 's work . " Richard filled a glass with red wine from a nearby carafe . " Here , drink this , Babbo , and you 'll feel better . " Morandi tossed it off , held out the glass to he filled again , drank more slowly this time , and smacked his lips . " Well , my boy , " he remarked , " those librettos are n't bad . " But remembering that Richard wanted to sell them to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedged at once . " Though of course they wo n't do for the stage . You know that . " Richard glanced meaningly at the scribbled pages of music on the rack . " I 'll admit , " Vico hurried to explain , " that I found the verses good . They even suggested some airs which I 've been jotting down for the pleasure of it . But , as operas for the San Giangrisos- tomo  --  " he smiled and shook his head  --  " they 're very amateur . " Looking about for another wine glass and not finding one , Richard tipped the carafe to his lips , took a pull , and , swinging up a chair , sat down . He was just as unconcerned as Vico and an equally good bargainer . IIe could sense that his stepfather liked the libret-114tos and that , after some passes , he would offer the least sum possible . But a small sum would n't do . He had recklessly mentioned two hundred sequins , the top price , to the Veniers , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To obtain such a price would take a miracle of persuasion . " You mean , Babbo , that the Very Noble Antonio Venier has n't dotted all the i 's and crossed all the is of your opera conventions . For instance . . . " Richard expertly ran through the list of technicaldefects that Morandi had noted . " And what of it ? Any libretto has to be adapted . There 's nothing in these that could n't be tailored to fit by the average theater hack . " Vico looked doubtful . " I 'm not so sure . It needs skill . I do n't know offhand of anyone I could turn to . " " What about me ? " The other considered this and nodded . Richard had a facile pen and knew the requirements of opera . " Possibly  --  if you would . " " Well , I will .  --  So , then ? " " Tell me , fio mio , how much of a cut are you getting from Venier ? " " Twenty on the hundred , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a labor of love would either not have been believed or would have led to too elaborate explanations . Morandi stroked his chin . He let his expression gradually soften . At last he said : " My boy , really I do n't want these librettos . But I 'm fond of you ; I 'd like to do you a good turn . And perhaps , between us , we could do something worth while . " Ile hesitated . " I 'll tell you , figliolo . For your sake , I 'm willing to pay fifty sequins for the two manuscripts . Fifty sequins . Your work thrown in , of course . That means ten whole sequins for you . A fat little sum . Almost picked up , you might call it . Well "  --  Vico rubbed his hands  --  " what do you say to that ? " The decks were now cleared , and action could start . Richard 's craggy face showed appreciation . " Very kind of you , Babbo , very kind . Unfortunately it 's impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . The Very Noble Antonio values his work at a much higher figure and , I think , properly . He demands two hundred se-115quins for the manuscripts and forbade me to sell them at a lower price . So , there you are . " " Two hundred sequins ? " Morandi balled his fists and lowered his head . " Did you say two hundred sequins ? " " Yes , the usual price for a good- libretto . Venier knows that ; so do you ; so do I. " " The price of a Metastasio ! The price of a Goldoni ! This fellow'sunknown . " " No , he is n't , Babbo . You 're wrong about that . Antonio Venier is more apt to fill a theater than either of them . Scandal of his marriage . Patrician who gave all for love . Two passionate plays by such an author . It wo n't take much to set the coffeehouses and coteries humming about him before the opera 's put on . " Remembering Venier , Richard had the grace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more offensive to that retiring gentlemanthan such promotion . But , thank Cod , with good management , he would never hear about it . And the plays had to be sold . " Two hundred sequins ! " Vico snorted again . " And here 's another point , " Richard went on . " Consider the ballets . Designed by the Siora Elena Venier herself . The dancer who stirred all Venice when she became the wife of Antonio Venier ! How that will acid to the interest of the opera , when the report gets about ! " " You did n't tell me of the ballets , " said Morandi . " Did n't I ? Well , so it is . But that is n't the best of it by a good deal . " He paused , smiling contentedly , and praised so long that Vico growled , " What do you mean ? " " I mean , " said Richard , " that I 've found it ballerina who would pack the theater if the opera offered no other attractions at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Oenone . I 'm speaking of Maritza Venier , daughter of the Siora Elena and of the Very Noble Antonio . I hope I do n't need to point out what an appeal that will have . " Morandi knew the Venetian public well enough to see at once the value of such a sensation . It would revive and enhance the former scandal , but , except from the standpoint of the ultraconservatives , in no objectionable way . It was not seditious ; the Council of116Ten would not ban it . Antonio Venier had paid for his folly . If his untitled daughter chose to become a ballerina , it was not illegal . The Venier clan and other patricians might frown , but they were also apt to be curious . The fashionable ladies of Venice , with their lovers and attendants , would be sentimentally thrilled . The middle classes , envious of their betters , would exult and flock to the theater . Finally , Vico remembered that his patron , Michele Grimani , proprietor of the San Giangrisostomo , had always spoken well of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen her dance ? " the director grumbled . " I have  --  at the Villa Bagnoli , and so did everybody there . She was splendid . Magnificent ! Listen , Babbo . You 'll have to admit that I know a dancer when I see one . I 've seen the best . And you can take my word for it that Maria Torelli or Ancilla Campioni herself is no better . Besides . . . " He explained how Maritza 's mother had trained her especially for these ballets . " So you see how it all fits in . " Morandi gave ground a little . " I 'll admit that what you say puts a different light on it , Richard . But I ca n't go to anything like two hundred sequins . That 's final . I 'll give you a hundred  --  my last figure . " This was the crisis . Except at San Luca 's , which specialized in comedy rather than opera , Richard had no such connection with the other theater directors as he had with his stepfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to sell anywhere , in spite of the waiting and wirepulling that would be involved . On the other hand , the scribbled notes on the music rack showed interest in the librettos . Besides , Richard had casually learned from his mother that Grimani had given Vico ample funds for any such purchase . It was not that the director lacked money , but that he intended to buy cheaply and to keep the difference for his own profit . But above all , what disappointment at the Palazzo Venier if Richard returned with only half of the expected price ! Naturally a gambler , he decided to plunge now . " No use , Babbo . My hands are tied . The illustrious author was very firm about the price . His dignity , he said , would not permit him to dispose of his work for less than the amount usually paid to Metastasio or Goldoni . I 'm sorry . I was hoping that these two operas would be your masterpieces , that they might even bring117back the great days of the San Giangrisostomo . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what with the new San Benedettc drawing the public . Still , a success would have been a feather in your cap if you move to Bordeaux . " Morandi frowned ; his eyes smouldered . But it was true that the Grimani theater had lost its pre-eminence in the last two years . His own management had n't been successful . The appointmentat Bordeaux was a saving of face rather than a promotion . He was a talented but not a great composer or director , although he did not admit that . He had simply never been lucky . He needed a success at this point . Richard tightened the screws . " So , I 'll sec what I can do at the San Benedetto . I think Galuppi will be interested . " The name of the famous composer , his dominant rival , overflowed Vico 's cup . He sprang to his feet , kicked a chair , and demanded to know why everything musical in Venice had to be consigned to that everlasting mill . Galuppi ! Galuppi ! Galuppi ! Were there no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hold your tongue ! " Vico flung over to the window and , leaning against one side of it , stood majestically with folded arms delving the injustice of life . On an inspiration , Richard got up and began looking through the notations to Theseus on the music rack . 1 ie stopped at one point , stretched out his hand , and plavecl the treble of a few bars . " Beautiful , caro ! " he admired . " Enchanting ! Baldassare Galuppi could n't do that . " " Ha ! " growled Morandi . In a low , pleasant voice , Richard sang : " Riposo dolce , pace innocente , Felice it cuor ... " " You can have the money , " Vico shouted . " By God , it 's well spent if I can keep those verses from being mauled by that tinkling jackass from Burano ! There are two operas , at least , that Galuppi wo n't compose . " " Bravo ! " Richard exclaimed . He strode across the room to em-11Rbrace his stepfather . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These operas will crown your reputation . They 'll immortalize you . They 'll break Galuppi 's heart . In the future , people will speak of you and Scarlatti , you and Porpora , you and Monteverdi . " It was a touching moment . Vico 's eyes smarted ; he blew his nose . But after the right pause , Richard murmured , " When can I expectpayment ? " " When you 've finished the work of adaptation . Of course that 's included in the price . As it is , you 're getting forty sequins of easy money . How long will it take you ? " Richard did not cavil . He had done so much better than he could have expected that he was content to let the other get away with this little finesse . " I 'll start at once . Probably I 'll need four or five days . " " Va bene . The desk is yours . I 've an appointment now at the Gaffe del Berizzi . " Vico put on his wig and coat , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rascal than most people , but he judged it prudent to add : " Naturally , I 'll expect Venier to sign a receipt for the money , as well as an understanding that the sale is void unless his daughter Maritza appears iii the ballet . " " Naturally , " agreed Richard , trying to keep his voice level . But when the door had closed , he gave a puff of satisfaction that flutteredthe sheets of music on the rack . The success was almost unbelievable . He stood picturing his return to the Palazzo Venier and could paint it in the brightest colors . So bright they were that he lost his head a little and , to the amazement of the Siora Binetti at her window across the court , he took a few dance steps here and there that looked very much like a jig . XVIIDURING the next five days , Jeanne Morandi often shook her headand smiled , as Richard labored early and late over the Venier manuscripts . But she did not speak to him on the subject of the headshakingsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his returnfrom the Brenta and must let it go at that . In the meantime , she119brought him his meals and got him to bed , though with some difficulty , at a not too unreasonable hour . She even pretended to believe the fiction that the motive of his hard work was the commissionto be paid by Venier . That made her smile as much as anything else . On the evening of the twelfth day since his visit at the palace , Richard handed over the revised manuscripts to his stepfather . There were a few additional changes that Vico wanted ; but , in high good humor , he paid out the two hundred sequins , drew up the papers to be signed by Venier and Maritza , and insisted on Richard 's drinking a bottle of wine with Inn ' as a flourish . The finishing touches on Theseus and O ( none took a part of the following morning . Richard was at work on them iii his room , when Nana , the maid , wide-eyed and with a letter in her hand , flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she gaped . " Ile 's waiting outside for an answer . A tall old man . . . Gondoliers were the usual messengers in Venice , but Richard did not often receive messages . The zigzag , unformed handwriting of his address on the outside was unnkuown ( o hint ; the paper itself looked unusual , as if it had been a flyleaf taken from some book and not too skillfully folded . At a loss , he pried off the blob of wax with his fingernail and spread the sheet open . But glancing beyond the thicket of writing at the signature , he made out the initials M. V. It took him a puzzled moment before he identified them . A letter from Maritza ! He could not read it with Nana staring at him . " Run along , " he told her . " Say to the man I 'll be out presentiv . " His eyes turned back to the page . The handwriting wavered , the spelling defied rules ; but she wrote just as she talked , and he could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caro Amico , I 've never done such a thing as this in my life . It 's very improper , but I do n't care . If von knew how I 've been waiting for a word from you about Father 's librettos ! The thought of dancing in one of the ballets is too exciting to ever come true ; but I 'd rather hear the worst than not hear anything . Twelve days ! Surely it would n't take Sior Vico Morandi that long to read the manuscripts . I suppose he has and does n't like them . I sup-120pose you 've taken them to some other director , and that you do n't want to discourage us . But caro Milor , ( I just ca n't go on calling you sior all the time ) , do n't be concerned about that . I want you to tell me frankly how matters stand . So , if this finds you home , will you please come with the messenger , Padron Zorzi Rosso , to his gondola , where I 'm waiting . Padron Zorzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seduced him to do this . Father and Anzoletta must never hear of it  --  especially not Anzoletta . Woe to me , if she did ! But I could n't wait any longer . La vostra buon arnica . M. V. " Richard kissed the letter , then got to his feet a little dizzily and hurried into his waistcoat and coat . How much more thrilling and wonderful this was than the call he had pictured for that afternoon ! To see Maritza alone ! To tell her the great news before anyone else ! To sit with her in the f elze of a gondola , just the two of them together ! By God ! By God ! . . . IIe stuffed the little canvas bag of sequins into one pocket , Maritza 's contract into another , crossed over to the door , remembered that he had n't brushed his hair , turned back to the mirror , headed again for the door , remembered his hat in time and caught it up . Ile was dressed in a nondescript old suit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , muttered vaguely about a business appointment to his mother in the salon , and dashed out to join Padron Zorzi on the stair landing . Gondoliers have a sharp eye for people , especially if , like Zorzi Rosso , they have spent a long life in that calling . Zorzi had heard a good account of Richard from Anzoletta ( in fact he knew all about the projected sale of the librettos ) or lie would never have let Maritza wheedle him into promoting such a rendezvous . As to anything that concerned his dear little Zelenza , Zorzi was respectabilityin person . But , for all that , he resolved to judge for himself . Richard might easily be one of those smooth rakes , of whom Zorzi had known plenty , who made an art of corrupting young girls under a show of good offices . But the short walk with Richard from the Morandi apartment to the Rio Crisostomo , where he had left his gondola , completely reassured him . Smooth rakes wore wigs ; they would rather be seen dead than appear out121of doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smooth rakes did not have an ink stain on the middle finger . They did not look so flurried and pleased , were not so coltish . It was lucky for Richard that he had not had time to dress . " A good lad , " thought Zorzi , warming up to his companion and hard put to keep up with him . " I hope your Worship has good news , " he said confidentially , when they had gone half a block . For a moment startled at the other 's inside knowledge until he recalled the lines of Maritza 's letter , Richard nodded . " The best . The very best , Padron . I was going to call this afternoon on his Excellence . But , you know , I think I 'll pretend at first that it is n't so good , just for fun . " The man 's eyes twinkled . " Benissimo ! Makes it all the better afterwards . Fine ! Will the little Siora dance ? That 's what she wants to hear . " " Yes . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dio ! " exclaimed Zorzi . " There 's one opera I would n't miss for a hundred doppias . I think her mother will come down from heaven to see it . " Thawing entirely now , he clapped Richard on the shoulder . " Bravo ! " And pointing , " There 's the gondola . " They could see the top of it above the embankment near the bridge . Zorzi became at once the impersonal boatman and dropped back a pace behind Richard ; but he exchanged nods with one of his colleagues , who had been asked to keep an eve on things while he was gone . Maritza could imagine herself on a breathless adventure ; actually she was very much guarded and chaperoned . The curtains of the little cabin were closed when Richard came up . But they were at once pushed aside , and Maritza in spite of all conventions stepped out . She wore the usual mask , of course , the usual black cloak or bauta , and a little three-cornered black hat . In such circumstances as these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mask was respected in Venice when almost every other propriety had ceased to be respected . But a masked lady did not pop out from the cabin of her gondola , stand in full view , and eagerly hail her approaching cavalier . " Ecco la ! Bondi , Miler . I was so afraid you were n't at home . .. " But she was scanning Richard 's face ; and , at the half-somber look which he contrived to put on , her voice fell away . She gave him her hand , drew back into the cabin , and sank down on the cushions. 122 " I suppose . . . " she faltered . " I 'm afraid you have n't very good news . . He seated himself next to her . " Well , madonna . .. . There was silence while Zorzi maneuvered the boat out into the canal . Her lips quivered below the mask . The sculling oar took up its rhythm . " Then your stepfather did n't like them ! " " There were objections . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , " These hot things ! " and tossed aside her hat , cloak , and mask . The disappointment in her eyes was already too much for Richard . His hand stole to the contract in his side pocket . Zorzi , watchful of conventions , directed from the poop : " If the Siora unmasks , she must draw the curtains . " Richard carried out the order . It was a delicious , dizzy moment to be so close to her in the curtained space . " And now , " she went on , " you have taken them to someone else . " " Not yet . Perhaps . " She leaned her head back and turned it away slightly . " Yes , of course . As I wrote you , it was too wonderful . . . I suppose things do n't happen that way . . . not that easily . But one ca n't help ... You see it would have made such a difference . . . " Her voice blurred . " Now I 'm being silly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled at the sheet of paper on her knees . " What 's this , Miler ? " Richard felt contrite . " I ought to have given it to you at once . This was n't the time for an act . I suppose I just ca n't keep away from stage business . Please forgive me . " She was reading the paper . Her lips silently shaped the words . " Dio mio ! " she breathed . " Dio mio ! . . . He dropped the plump little bag of sequins into her lap . " But , Miler . . . " And here . . . " He handed her the receipt to be signed by her father . Still dazed , she read half aloud : " ' I , Antonio Venier , hereby acknowledge to have received . . . it being understood that my daughter . . . in the ballet . . that this clause is essential to123the sale ... " ' She drew her finger across her forehead . " But then .. . but then ! " The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shesat speechless a moment , gazing at him , her eyes dilated . " I think you are the cruelest person ! I think you 're  --  Oh , Miler , I am sohappy ! " She read the contract again . " Me ! " she whispered . " Me ! At the San Giangrisostomo ! " Springing up , she turned , flung the rear curtains aside and , half leaning out , called to the stern : " Zorzi ! Zorzi ! It happened ! Everything ! The librettos ! Me  --  a ballerina ! At last ! Zorzi ! But youmust n't breathe a word of it at home . I 'll pretend to be just as surprised as they are . Promise ! " The gondolier rose to the occasion . Suspending his stroke , hewaved his left hand in a flourish and abounded in joy , amazement and benedictions . " Please take us somewhere on the lagoon  --  " she went on , " towards the Lido . There 's so much to talk over . " " Yes , and will the Siora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once more screened from curious eyes , Maritza settled herself on the seat . " And now tell me everything , ' Miler , just as it happened . But no play-acting . I still think you 're dreadfully cruel . " It can not be said that Richard 's account of his dealings with Vico Morandi was strictly accurate . The inducements which hadled the director to pay the full price were left out . The campaignto be launched in the coffeehouses , the value of scandal as an attractionto the public , did not have to be mentioned . To thecredit of Richard 's modesty , if not of his candor , Maritza could believe that he had done nothing except prevail on Vico to read themanuscripts . Afterwards everything had gone of itself . Even the work of adaptation was barely touched on . When they had finished with this , the absorbing plans for that evening had to be discussed : how Anzoletta would first hear the news ; how she would then call Maritza , how the three of them would proceed to Venier 's study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining out somewhere  --  in one of the semipublicgardens of the Giudecca or at Murano . And the menu . Sior Pa 're loved polpettino ; Anzoletta , roast sausages . Turbot was the best fish in September . How strange it seemed to be rich ! . . . 124The gondola threaded the colorful shipping of the harbor , glided under the sharing figureheads of merchantmen , under the gilded stems of mighty frigates . The shadows of them momently darkenedthe little cabin . A smell of tar , spices , and of Eastern cargoes , hung on the air . Now and then snatches of outlandish tongues reached them . And finally there was only the empty lagoon , bright in the morning haze , and the gentle lapping of water as they drifted with the tide . But now Maritza , with the theater contract on her knees , felt the first pangs of stage fright . How could she ever face those tiers of boxes , that vast pit , the sea of faces , the critical , Argus-eyed public ? She already felt weak in the knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably no more than three months off ? Richard , comparatively an old hand , reassured her . Of course you were scared  --  you never entirely got over being scared  --  but once you were on the stage something happened . You found yourself doingtwice as well as at rehearsals . The ballet master , Monsieur d'Aubry , would see to that . Maritza was full of questions about Monsieur d'Aubry and about that season 's troupe at the San Giangrisostomo . It was her first experience of theater gossip . She enjoyed the new terms , the slang , the professionalism . Richard took care not to dampen her enthusiasm and described the San Giangrisostomo company in as favorable colors as possible . But , reviewing them name by name , he began to feel uncomfortableand even a little panicky . It dawned on him more and more that in trying to please Maritza he had done her perhaps the worst disservicepossible . He did not mention the vulgarity , the jealousies , the morals , above all the defenselessness of theater women and especially of dancers ; the thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attendance ; the necessity and the cost of patronage ; the dirty scandals . Some imp in his mind called up one detail of the sort after another . And there sat Maritza in her simple cottondress , unsophisticated as a spring dawn , romanticizing the theater world ! What would happen when the first damned roue . . . Richard turned hot and cold . " What 's wrong ? " she asked . " You look troubled about some-thing. " 125 " Well , " he hesitated , " it 's a different kind of people from any you 've known . A lot of things go on that you wo n't like . You 've never been backstage , madonna . It 's not the same as front , and you spend most of your time there . Perhaps you 'll find it hard  --  " he paused for the right word  --  " a little coarse . You ought n't to imagineit better than it is . " Impulsively her hand closed upon his a moment and set his heart racing . " Caro ti ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not made of porcelain . Most girls are n't , really . They only pretend . I suppose you think that because I 've been brought up so much alone I do n't know anything about life . Well , I do . Mamma was a ballerina  --  she told me how things are . Anzoletta does n't mince words , either . No , I wo n't be shocked . And I can take care of myself . Marin Sagredo found that out , remember . If you do n't like dirt , it 's my belief that it wo n't hurt you . " Richard 's hand still burned from the brief contact with hers . In the case of any other girl , this would have been an invitation . But instinctively he knew better than to so consider it . " Besides , " she was saying , " you 'll be at San Luca 's . It is n't far from the San Giangrisostomo . We 'll meet often . You can advise me about things . San Luca has a ballet . Maybe sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Milor ! Caro ! That would be wonderful ! ... " Yes , he was not so poor at dreams that he had not long since picturedthat  --  and a much more radiant sequel . But now they talked about the coining season . She had never had more than glimpses of the carnival . Suppose they slipped away some night after the close of the theaters , mingled with the crowd on the Piazza , went to the Ridotto ? She turned on the seat to face him , her eyes shining with excitement . " Oh , magari ! What fun ! Is it a bargain ? " " Per Dio , a bargain ! " And then , for no reason at all , they fell silent . She flushed a little and looked down . He felt awkward but divinely happy . It was just a moment ; it takes no longer than that to turn a page . When she raised her eyes , there was a new light in them  --  and doubtless in his , too , for she looked down again . Zorzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get-126ting back if the errand she was supposed to be doing at a shop in the Calle dei Fabbri was not to be suspected at the palace . So , they retraced their way across the harbor . By the time they parted at the bridge on the Rio Crisostomo , the thought of the approachingevening absorbed them again . The precious papers and the bag of sequins were once more in Richard 's pockets for the official surpriselater . Maritza put on her cloak , hat , and mask ; but she smiled " A rivederci " and let him hold her hand to his lips longer than farewellrequired . He returned to the apartment on wings . It was the happiest day of his life . And , to crown it , a letter had arrived from Dr. Goldoni , who was still with the Widimans . No doubt it confirmed the San Luca appointment . Perhaps Richard would even learn what his openingrole would be . He broke the seal . " Listen , petite Maman , " he said to Jeanne . " I 'll read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes leaped down thepage . " Richard , has something happened ? " she demanded . " Why don'tyou read it to me ? " But he was still gazing at the paper , his face drawn . Then , sitting down , he said , " Here , read it yourself . " In the silence , as she read , phrases of the letter mingled with hisown thoughts . " . The Very Noble Marin Sagredo has made it clear to his ExcellenceFrancesco Vendramin that if you appear at San Luca 's or in any other theater of Venice , he will contrive such unpleasantnessthat the play must fail . And his Excellence does not dare . . . Yes , it was easy to hire disturbers in the unruly , restless playhouses . No management dared invite that kind of thing . Recourse to law to protect an insignificant actor against the House of Sagredo ? Absurd ! " ... My dear boy , I believe the very noble gentleman will notstop at this . You should leave Venice at once . There are other citiesin Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ago ? Jeanne replaced the letter on the table . " You must come withus to France . " 127But Maritza was in Venice . Any other place seemed impossible . Then he thought of the approaching evening and rallied . Nothing must spoil that . He snapped his fingers and , springing up , embraced his mother . " Who cares about San Luca ! I can do other things than act . It 'll take more than Sagredo to get me out of Venice now . But is n't it funny ? " He thought of the two letters that bracketed the morning . " Why does a man always have to keep his fingers crossed ? " XVIIITO the average Venetian , the three months from early September till the end of autumn were simply a change of season . To Maritza Venier , glancing back , they seemed a decade . That morning with Richard on the lagoon , though unforgettable . looked immensely far off , like a point viewed through the big end of a telescope . It belongedalmost to another life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met lonsieur d'Aubry , not to speak of a hundred others who were now her daily companions ; had not worked in the ballet master 's treaclnmill ; had not been initiated into the patter and outlook of the ( lancing profession ; had not coped with the spite of veteran ballerinas who saw a newcomerpromoted to the leading part in the Theseus ballets . She felt much older , hard and worldly-wise as compared with the ingenueof September . Of course she had started off with a big lead over the usual beginner . Naturally gifted , she had also been thoroughly trained by her mother . Monsieur d'Aubry could teach her little about the fundamentals of dancing . She began , too , with the prestige of her father 's rank and her mother 's professional fame . The kinswoman of patricians and the daughter of a celebrity like Elena Klahr had a very different rating from the ordinary little figurante . Then , too , there was Richard , who , as Vico Morandi 's stepson , knew everybodybackstage and could smooth the wav for her . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaperon and bodyguard . But more important than anything else , perhaps , was Maritza 's own temperament , good-humored and natural . She wasfriendly but not intimate , played no favorites , did not flirt , indeed seemed indifferent to men , with the exception of Richard . Naturallyenough it got around that there was a serious understanding between them ; and this , premature as it was , blocked one form of jealousy . So far , then , she had made a good start . Monsieur d'Aubry prophesied great things for her . " I warn you , " he remarked to friends more than once , " that , barring accidents , she will be a great dancer . Yes , it would not astonish me if sometime you saw her  --  " he paused for effect and then expressed the ultimate  --  " as a premiere danseuse at the Opera in Paris . " And meanwhile , Vico Morandi , with the speed that marked composition at that time , had finished the music for Theseus . Giovanna Casatti would sing Ariadne ; Serafini , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago by Maritza 's mother had been similarly set to music and rehearsed . Gossip , not altogether spontaneous , predicted success , revived the romantic scandal of Venier 's marriage , puffed Maritza , whetted the curiosity of the public in salon and coffeehouse . Anonymous sonnets , celebrating Maritza in the fashion of the day , were printed and circulated . They were not too bad to have been written by various prominent people , and guesses at their authorshipranged from very noble patricians to very clever abbes . Richard , who turned them out at dead of night , took good care to be unidentified with them . As advance publicity for Maritza , they would have had no point unless fashionable names could be tagged to them . Among others , that of the Cavaliere Tromba , now elegantlyinstalled at the Grimani palace , became prominent . Since unmistakable allusions to the Villa Bagnoli appeared in the sonnets , since people remembered that he had danced with her there , and since more than once he had been present at the ballet rehearsals , his authorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; denial was to be expected . Of course , by one hand or another , the leaflets reached Maritza . They were in good taste , hinted at nothing personal , expressed only admiration for her dancing , and hailed the new Terpsichore of Venice , attended by Fame , Fortune and the Graces . At first she made fun of them a little , but was immensely pleased. 128 129 " Richard , do you swear , " she would say , " that you do n't know who writes these things ? " " Of course I swear . " " So , you do n't know who it is ? Word of honor ? Because the first one I thought of was you . " " Good God ! " he exclaimed , resisting the temptation to confess . " If I wrote about you , madonna , I 'd try to be original at least . I 'd leave out the gods and nymphs  --  all that old ballast . " She colored a little at the expression in his eyes and changed the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father and me . They tell me we 're even talked of in the coffeehouses . How does it happen ? " Richard could have told her a good deal . Ripples of interest , launched in various quarters , had built np a wave of expectation that would fill the theater on the opening night of Theseus . " It 's the pride of the city in itself , " lie explained . " A Venetian author , composer and ballerina . The name Venier has a good deal to do with it . People love to talk . And a good thing , too , for the success of the opera . " She sighed . " I suppose you 're right . I 've been learning here at the San Giangrisostomo that the success of art has little to do with art . " But this was before she heard the gossip that linked the sonnets with Marcello Tromba . She faced Richard with it in her dressing room after a rehearsal . They were momentarily alone , since Anzoletta , who had had several clashes with prowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it , " Maritza said . " I do n't want my name connected with him . " Richard had seen a good deal of Troinba since the latter 's arrival in Venice from the mainland . Balked of employment at San Luca 's and for the time being at loose ends , he found the Cavaliere 's patronage flattering and agreeable . It gave a sense of security to have such backing against the continued threat of Sagredo . Besides , he was fascinated by the arts  --  legerdemain , ventriloquy , and magic  --  to which Tromba , an adept in the whole field of deception , was playfully introducing him as a gifted and diligent pupil . It delighted Richard to exhibit each new accomplishment at the Palazzo Venier. 130 " I give you my word that his Excellence did not write a line of those sonnets . " " How do you know ? " " I asked him about it , " Richard invented . " There 'd be no point of his lying to me . You ca n't prevent gossip . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single name in Venice that would be more flatteringto you . He 's the lion of the season . There is n't a gentildonna in town who would n't be charmed if he wrote verses about her . " " Here 's one , " Maritza put in firmly . " But why ? " " You know very well . You know what his reputation is . The Great Gallant . I heard enough of that at the Villa Bagnoli . The kind of man who never thinks of a woman except in one way . I could feel it when I danced with him and when you 've brought him here to the theater . Rating us all through that French lorgnette , like an expert at a sale . Mention a girl in connection with him , and people wink . That 's what makes me angry about this . Is n't there something we can do ? " He shrugged . " Deny it of course . But there 's no offense in the poems . My word ! They 're correct and distant enough . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tromba wrote them . It puts you in the fashion . It 's just the right cachet for a ballerina at her debut . " " You mean it 's the right cachet to be considered the choice of a popular rake ? " " If you 're not his choice , " Richard flushed , " and do n't intend to be , what 's the harm ? It makes you interesting to the public ; it brings people to the theater . " She faced him , square as a rock , " I think that 's cheap . " " Listen , cara , " he said , a little ruffled . " You 've chosen the career of dancing . You want success . That means winning the public , makingit love you , not just your dancing . And people do n't love prudes . It 's the same in opera or drama . The stage is the stage . Perhaps anything that caters to the public has to be a little cheap . It 's the way the world is . " Maritza retorted : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Milor , but he seems to be with us again . I 'm not a prude because I do n't want people connecting me with Marcello Tromba . It 's simply that I hate sham and do have scruples . Of131course a girl ought n't to go on the stage if she wants the reputationof a nun . Nuns do n't do entrechats and show off theirfigures . But a girl does n't have to be a scheming little timeserver , either . " " Does n't she ? " put in Richard . " Up to a point . she does . " " What point ? " IIe found no ready answer to that . The argument was carrying them afield , as arguments do . " Look , " she went on , " if I succeed , it wo n't be thanks to people like Marcello Tromba . I 'll please the public  --  yes ; but I wo n't have any other patron . Would you like to wager ? " " Of course not . I hope you wo n't . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would not need a patron , he thought , because she would marry him . Otherwise , the idea of a ballerina , independentof husband or influential lover , making her way in the corrupt theaters of the time , was sadly ridiculous . lfis mother could have told her a good deal about that . He could not help quoting a littlestiffly : " Just the same , madonna , you nuuv find it hard to live with wolves if you wo n't run with the pack . " They left it there , each a trifle out of tune with the other , each aware of an obscure antagonism and disturbed because of it . Later , they made up , of course ; or , rather , because the issue between them was so indefinable , they pretended that there was none . And yet , for some reason , this particular disagreement , like a pebble in one 's shoe , kept on nagging ; and they seemed unable to escape it . But such things were trifles compared with the awesome approachof that towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theseus at the San Giangrisostomo . For Maritza , everything referred to it  --  the fading snnune'r ; the rains and chill of autumn ; fire on the hearth ; warmer clothes ; the bells of All Saints ' ; the more frequent masks on street or piazza , forerunners of carnival  --  everything marked the passing of time toward that evening of crisis . She felt eager but more often terrified . And terrorgrew , as the days dwindled to a fortnight , then to a week , then to only a day. 132XIXIN an orchestra stall which his valet had been holding for him , Signor Mario Caretti , newly arrived in Venice , savored the splendor of the San Giangrisostomo theater . Here , he proudly reflected , was a fitting temple for music ; and here , as he looked around at the gathering audience , was a musically civilized public  --  how different from the stodgy Britons and tone-deaf Frenchmen , among whom , of late years , his lot had been cast ! He foresaw a delightfulevening and happily polished the glasses of his lorgnette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London did not depress him at the moment . He had still a couple of weeks and would make the most of them . A diplomatic representative of the King of Sardinia and condemned to long periods of residence abroad in the cold northern capitals , Caretti passionately enjoyed his brief recalls to the music and color of Italy . Business at the court in Turin never detained him too long . He always managed a round of pleasant pilgrimages to other centers , to the opera in Parma or Milan , to the theaters of Florence and Bologna ( once even to Naples ) , where he relieved his pent-up hunger for Italian music and Italian acting . In this roving banquet , he always kept Venice for dessert , a final enchantment and satiety , to tide him over another stretch of exile . In Venice there were seven great theaters ; there was opera every night duringthe season ; there was symphony of instruments and voices at St. Mark 's and other churches , at the four musically renowned conservatoriesfor young girls , not to mention the numberless private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-indulgent . For diplomatic and personal reasons , Caretti gladly combined it with small services . If Lord So-and-So in London desired a capital piece of Italian painting for his new house , if Lady Such-and-Such yearned for Venetian glass or Parma perfume or Florentine majolica , Signor Caretti did his best to oblige them . He hoped , during the present round , to accommodate his ingenious friend Mr. Garrick , manager of Drury Lane Theatre . The latter had earnestly begged him to keep an eye open for possible talent to meet the English demand for new faces and voices in Italian opera and had commissionedhim to act in his interest. 133Thus far , Caretti had found no one who , if free , had promise enough to meet Garrick 's requirements . But Venice was a rich field . He had heard good things of tonight 's singers , Giovanna Casatti and the male soprano Serafini . Perhaps he would have luck tonight . The thought added to his sense of expectation . Standing up , his glasses poised , he surveyed the expanse of the theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundredpeople . Five tiers of boxes rose above the orchestra to the shadowy ceiling . They were richly gilded , and inset medallions at regular intervals gave another touch of magnificence . The interior , as a whole , looked vague because of the meager lighting common to all Italian playhouses of the time ; but individual loges stood out sharply in the gloom , bright with their own candles , displaying a group at cards or taking refreshments . Scattered here and there at various levels in the obscurity of the house , these vivid glimpses seemed to hover like images cast by a magic lantern . And since , by custom , nearly everyone in the boxes wore cloak and mask , each separate group looked weird and unearthly . Having gazed enough , Signor Caretti sat down , ready for the overture . An attendant applied his taper to the footlights . The orchestra leader entered , took his place at the harpsichord , nodded to the musicians , and the first movement began . An opera lover of even the next century would have been amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical drama which the audience that night considered in perfect taste . Caretti found the costuming admirable . Theseus appeared in a feather-duster helmet , curled wig , brocaded doublet , silk stockingsand flowing mantle . Ariadne , garbed in the latest fashion , wore a train so heavy that it had to be carried at all times by two little blackamoor page boys . The other mythological characters showed a like hodgepodge of fancy and Parisian styles . As for the music , the singers of course entirely eclipsed the composerand orchestra , let alone the librettist . The handsome verses over which Venier had toiled served merely as a thread of recitative on which to string arias . And the longer these lasted , the better . In the libretto , which Caretti consulted by the light of a penny taper purchased at the entrance , the action covered most of the134space ; but , in point of time , the arias at the end of each scene took four times as long . They were the vocal gymnastics which the audiencemost wanted to hear . They re-created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with shakes and runs so prolonged that the orchestra could lean back and take snuff , when it did not hover in the background with a haphazard accompaniment . And the effeminate voice of the castrate Serafini , supple and powerful beyond the reach of any tenor in the future , outsoared the highest notes of Signora Casatti and brought down the house . And other , less eminent , singers had their chance at an aria . Occasional duets , but never a chorus , varied the concert . Meanwhile , of course , wonders took place on the stage . Lightning flashed ; thunder pealed ; demons rose from the underworld ; gods floated down from Olympus ; Medea made a grand impression in her dragon chariot ; and the scene shifted in every direction . Finally , with Theseus and Ariadne in the depths of despair , attended by a climax of arias , the first act closed amid flattering applause . So far , Caretti decided , the opera could be termed a moderate success worth several repetitions . Realistically , however , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal of Hasse ; Venier did not excel Metastasio . As for the singers , Caretti , with his friend Mr. Garrick in mind , found them capable but mediocre  --  certainly not worth the salaries paid in England , nor worth presenting to a public that still recalled the peerless Faustina and Farinelli . No , he would have to look further . And now came the ballet , as an intermezzo between acts . It would doubtless be a leaden affair and much worse in its kind than the opera  --  indeed contemptible to anyone who had seen ballet in Paris . For , prejudiced as Caretti might be in favor of Italy , he had to admit that Italian dancing could not hold a candle to the French . So , leaning back at this point , he exchanged remarks with a neighbor and then , as the curtains once more parted , sat picking his teeth . In keeping with the nature of the opera , it was supposed to be a dance of nymphs and shepherds ; but the nymphs , of course , were modishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be envied by the gallants in the boxes . The object was not only to entertain but to furnish a pattern of graceful dancing , which could135be imitated , if never equaled , by the amateurs in the audience . Passepieds , gavottes , allemandes , minuets , furlanas. tambourins , and chaconnes , would follow each other . If , here and there , entrechats and pirouettes were introduced , they would serve merely as garnish . The dresses of the ballerinas , made of flowered silk , damask , or brocade , would inspire imitation as well as their steps . Skirts were little shorter than those worn at a ball or fiesta . And yet the gentlemen'sopera glasses did not go unrewarded by neat ankles , decollete charms , and now and then even by a shattering glimpse of lovely calves . Unaware of Monsieur d'Aubry 's work , Caretti noted with surprisethat the ballet of the San Giangrisostomo had improved since his last visit a couple of years ago . It was still provincial by Parisian standards ; but it actually looked French and was not unpleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , as the others drew back , leaving the prima ballerina alone at the center of the stage for a pas soul , Caretti 's eyes opened and his lorgnette became rigid . During the rest of the ballet he did not lower it again . One of life 's sudden events faced him , though at the moment he was too absorbed to realize it . He found this girl simply delicious to look at , and he could not look at anyone else . She seemed so fresh and young , so vibrant , as she stood poised a moment on the threshold of her dance . Perhaps a little frightened , but if so , the more appealing . Caretti felt a pang of personal suspense . Then she relaxed to the music , like a swallow upon the air , and he forgot concern in artistic enjoyment . Ile had seen the great Camargo on the Parisian stage before her retirement six years earlier . The thought of her now came vividly to his mind . Here was the same sparkle and lightness , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience and to infuseit with a spirit of gaiety . But Marie-Anne de Camargo had been relatively old when he had seen her ; this girl was young , and youth gave her its special aura . Yes , she pleased him infinitely  --  infinitely . IIe took an odd pride in the applause that now burst out increasingly through the theater , as if confirming his opinion of her ; but he felt , too , an obscure jealousy that she had so many admirers . Spontaneous bravas and benissimos spread like wildfire . She finished the tambourin she was dancing , with a flicker of136entrechats . But the orchestra leader , sensing the will of the audience , signaled an encore . And now , caught up by the applause , she danced like the spirit of carnival itself , showing her gratitude to the public with an unfeigned happiness that endeared her all the more , imparting to everyone her own delight . And the house answeredwith a roar of admiration , fell completely in love with her , replied to her deep curtsy , as the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . salvos of clapping , an immense nimble of evvivas . Thenceforth , even in the composite figures of the ballet , all eyes were on her . And , at the end , one united voice called her before the curtain . Viva Maritza Venier ! Siestu benedetta ! . . . Benedetto el pare the t'ha f atta ! " There , " exclaimed Caretti 's neighbor , when the ovation had died clown , " is a twenty-four carat ballerina . I do n't believe that the Campioni herself ever had more applause . It 's a feather in our caps , sir , to have been present at her debut  --  something to talk about , eh ? " " Indeed , " Caretti murmured vacantly . " Yes , to be sure . " The other ran on : " She 's certainly robbed her father tonight of his laurels .  --  Though I 'll wager he does n't mind . There he is up yonder in that loge . Looks pleased , does n't he ?  --  It 's a good opera  --  yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , was straordinarissimo , maravigliosissimo .. . " He piled on superlatives . " Am I right ? " " Entirely , " Caretti agreed . He did not want to lose the vision he had had by gossiping . He wanted to lean back in the semidarkness and let the rose-clad figureof the girl go dancing through his thoughts . What witchery of gesture ! What perfection of movement ! The radiance of her smile ! The expressiveness of her hands ! She had worn a little coronal of pale rose that matched her dress  --  and her youth . He was middle-aged , a man of forty , a bachelor , and a very correctdiplomat . Thus far , his career and dilletante passion for the arts had left only a small and casual place for women in his life . But now , from some unsuspected depths in himself , rose the ferment of spring , a new or at least a forgotten sensation . It restored briefly the climate of twenty-one . The opera had resumed . The lungs of Signora Casatti vied with137the lungs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arias . Invisible machinists pulled ropes . It all passed unnoticed by thediplomat from Turin , who was lost in dreams . He returned to Veniceonly when the opera closed with a grand finale in the form of aballet . And as Theseus and Ariadne , happily reunited , witnessed the dancing of their joyful subjects  --  a graceful minuet , a rompingallemande , a sprightly chaconne  --  they shared the storm of applausethat greeted Maritza 's final pas seul and could imagine , if they pleased , that the tribute was for them . " Questa ! Ouuesta ! " shouted the public , demanding a repetition when , according to custom , the title of another opera was announcedfor next time . " Give us the same ! " And , " Viva Maritza Venier ! " But Mario Caretti did not wait . He was already shouldering his way out and around to the stage door , where a tip would give him access to the coulisses . Even so , there were others in front of himand at his heels , a throng of young dandies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With practised assurance , he made hisway forward to where she stood , the radiant center of a jubilating group , including her father and a broad-shouldered peasant woman . Caretti knew that she would soon be whisked off to celebrate the triumph of the opera somewhere . But he did not intend to forgo a few words . She kept curtsying to compliments , shy and a little overwhelmed , but her smile was adorable . " Serva , " she murmured " Grazie , sior . . . your servant . . . your servant . . . " Applause still continued far off beyond the curtain . Then , at last . " Mario Caretti , " he bowed . " An ambassador from London to the most exquisite dancer I have ever seen . The great Mr. Garrick ofDrury Lane presents his homage to Maritza Venier and the offerof a most flattering engagement . If I could wait on you tomorrow . . Confused , she did not understand . " London ? Mistair Garreek ? Of course . . . if you wish . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she greeted excitedly as Milor , now pushed in front of Caretti . But tomorrow . . . 138Yes , thought the gentleman from Turin , making his way out of the theater , Garrick could congratulate himself . A salary twice the size of any Maritza could hope for in Italy would be a bargain from the standpoint of London . And certainly she would not refusesuch an offer , with the prestige connected with it . But actually Garrick was only a front for Mario Caretti himself . He imagined next year and found London transformed . Intimate pictures hovered in his mind . Himself as her benefactor . Himself with the privilege of her dressing room at Drury Lane . Himself with Maritza at Ranelagh or at Richmond on the Thames , when spring in England brought back lilacs and blue skies . Himself .. . XXST . STEPHEN 'S Day , that marked the official opening of the carnival , had come and gone . And now the season when Venice lived most intensely was well past the middle of its course , quickening in tempo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ridotto grew more packed ; the gold on its tables multiplied . The private casini , those jaunty little rendezvous of wealth and fashion , so much less formal than the great palaces , hummed with guests of prodigal hosts . Costumes and masks and mountebanks thronged the streets . The two hundred cafes of the city functioned day and night ; its theaters and inns reaped the annual harvest ; its two hundred thousand population went more or less mad . It was the season of folly and , therefore , welcome to those who exploited folly . Among them , Marcello Tromba made the most of it , both as to pleasure and profit . Reviewing his sojourn thus far in Venice and on the mainland , Tromba had every reason to be content . He had been lucky in love and at cards ; had contracted valuable friendships ; had founded two separate lodges of the occult Masonic order which he was promoting ; and , in this connection , had called up phantoms of the dead , practised the Cabala and given startling proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the trusted adviser and almost the adopted son of rich , old , doting Senator Grimani , he blazed in the forefront of the beau monde , had an apartment in the **26;7268;TOOLONG TIME AND TIME AGAIN after what had been said between them . During his walk over muddy farmlands he had even searched for a cross-grain of truth in the accusation  --  Was it possible that by joining the O.T ' . C. he had secured a few weeks ' delay in the then inevitable destiny of being sent into battle , and that those few weeks , by the timing of history , had meant life for him instead of death ? But even if this were so , it could not justify even remotely his father 's attitude . While he was putting on dinner clothes the bedroom door opened and Havelock entered . He was still in the rough tweeds of everyday wear , but he looked already years older . " We are n't dressing tonight , " he said quite calmly . " Did n't Cobb tell you ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long walk . " " Well . . . I tried to read a little . . . everyone has to get over these things their own way . I do n't really remember what it was I said to you  --  probably something foolish . " Charles answered : " Oh , that 's all right , Father  --  it was noth- ing . " He was too deeply moved to say more . Havelock then left and Charles changed his clothes again . It struck him as odd that , because of his brother 's death , he was actually taking off a black tie , though of course he put on another one of a different kind . eAzy-o Charles looked forward to the end of the vacation . Not only was the news about Lindsay a devastating grief , but its coming at a time of family gathering and sentimental association made it trebly hard to endure . And there was a new kind of unease between himself and his father , as if the sounding and explora- tion of a rift were all the time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the new year the house rapidly emptied , leaving Charles alone with his father and aunt during the last week before term began . Sir Havelock Anderson was a remarkable man by any stand- ards , and it was unfortunate ( as somebody once said when this remark was made ) that any standards had not been good enough in his chosen profession . In his thirties , a barrister beginning to be talked about , he would have been forecast for a brilliant career , with a likely outcome in parliament or as one of the law officers of the Crown ; in his middle forties he seemed at the point of achievement , having already taken silk and received a knighthood . He had many attributes of the successful advocate  --  good looks , a fine presence , quick wits , commanding eloquence , and an enormously persuasive manner . He could demolish or inveigle a witness with a technique that amounted to genius . The one thing he lacked was a certain responsibility of judgment at moments of intense pressure ; as his career advanced and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of propriety , attacking the other side in ways that drew rebukes from judges , then turning on the latter with less than traditional respect . Since he seemed increasingly unable to handle a difficult case without this sort of thing , solicitors came to regard him as a doubtful asset ; after one sensational court " scene " he narrowly escaped disbarment . Though he apologized and all seemed forgiven , he had done himself harm which he knew had put him back to the bottom of the ladder , and it was perhaps again unfortunate that a private income enabled him to settle into embittered retirement rather than begin the climb afresh or seek a new career in some other field . Everything was unhappy and inglorious when , about this time , he inherited Beeching . For years thereafter he lacked interest in the property , his chief consolation being Lindsay , in whom he could well take pride . For the boy , who was very like him in looks , developed fast and promisingly  --  excellent at games as well as studies  --  destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as himself but without the flaw . When Lindsay went to school Havelock had to find things to do , even at Beeching , and gradually established himself as the kind of chartered eccentric that English society permits and tolerates  --  which really means that none of his neighbors , whether they liked him or not ( and most of them did n't ) , thought it very odd that he should be a little odd . Though he was never now42 TIME AND TIME AGAINin the headlines , he often appeared in print  --  writing letters to The Times about his hobbies , which included bird watching , collecting snuffboxes , and visits to country churchyards , where he liked to rummage among old tombstones and discover neglectedgraves of minor celebrities of the past ; he was something of an expert on lapidary inscriptions . Strong in physique and passionate by nature , he was also a magnet to women , but here again the flaw presently showed itself  --  a scandal involving the suicide of the daughter of one of his neighbors , a girl in her twenties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widower . One quality he had to which both friends and enemies gave the same name , but with differing inflections  --  charm . His friends had in mind the urbane host and the delightful talker , but his enemies said that this charm was something he could turn on and off at will , and always on when he wanted anything  --  an old courtroom trick put to nonprofessional use. aBefore Charles left for the station to catch the London train en route for Cambridge , he had a talk with his father in which the charm , turned on or not , was as antique as the snuffboxes . Havelock began by discussing the Anderson name and his own pride in it  --  one of those great families of commoners , he said , that in a sort of way constituted an English aristocracy of their own . In such company a mere knighthood was not so much a painting of the lily as a defacement . " Who can wish to rub the eager shoulders of provincial mayors and successful shopkeepers ? Of course if I 'd stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but today , as things are , I 'm probably stuck where I am , and you must reconcile yourself to having Sir Havelock Anderson for a father instead of plain mister or esquire . " All of which seemed to Charles either obtuse or a snobbery of extra-special vintage . He said : " Oh , it does n't make much difference at Cambridge . I do n't think many of my friends even know about the title . " TIME AND TIME AGAIN 43 " You have my full authority to conceal it from them . Anyhow , your own affairs and what you intend to do in life are more important . Have you thought of a profession ? " Charles had n't , especially . So they ran through the possibilities , some of which were impossibilities , such as the armed services and medicine , for which Charles had neither desire nor aptitude . Havelock himself ruled out the law ; he did not think Charles was suited , which was a politer way of saying he did not think he had the brains . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lindsay was then on his mind ; Lindsay was to have entered the law , for which a brilliant Cambridge career had already prepared him just before war came . It was as if Havelock did not want Charles 's career to trespass , even had it been possible , on the hallowed might-have-been territory that Lindsay would always occupy in his mind . What about the Church ? Charles shook his own head at that , and Havelock smiled in part concurrence . The City ? Selling stocks was n't much of a job , but undeniably there were youths of decentfamily who nowadays went into brokers ' offices and made money there . Charles said innocently that he did n't think he would ever know what stocks to buy , which made Havelock smile again and remark that his own broker did n't seem to , either . Thus , having arrived at a fairly cordial impasse , father and son could only concede that the matter was in no way urgent and that the first step was for Charles to do well at Cambridge , taking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , since he was an exhibitioner . To which Havelock replied : " Oh yes , of course . I really did n't congratulate you enough about that . But at the time , you see . . . " Charles knew what he meant ; Lindsay had been alive at the time , and Charles 's achievements and future had n't then mattered . Now they did matter , but only in a pale shadow of the way Lindsay 's had mattered . Havelock continued : " Well , you 've made a beginning . You must have studied quite hard . Somehow I never thought you did44 TIME AND TIME AGAINmuch in your spare time except paint little pictures . Or have you given that up ? " " No , I still like to do it . A pleasant hobby that gets one into the open air . " " So long as you do n't take it too seriously . No man should take his hobbies seriously till he has succeeded  --  or failed , for that matter  --  in his profession . " ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way , there 's one profession we forgot . Diplomacy . Not bad if you have manners and like travel . Dressy fellows  --  useful too , so they 'd have us believe . They did n't prevent the last war and they wo n't prevent the next , but at least it 's work that does n't soil the hands . " Charles then responded to his father 's irony with a remark that he recalled , long afterwards , with a certain irony of his own . " Oh , I really do n't think we need worry about another war in your lifetime or mine , Father . " " No ? I wonder . There 's France . There 's Japan . There 's Russia . There 's America . Even Germany again if we 're fools enough  --  and we shall be . " Evidently nothing less than the total destruction of the entire rest of the world would give Havelock any confidence in a lastingpeace ; and there were times in later life when Charles was almost driven to think his father might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Charles worked steadily at Cambridge . Except for a little beer drinking that sometimes ended up as a private spree among friends , he lived and studied quietly in rooms that overlooked the College Backs and the river ; to his gyp he was " a reading gentleman , " and among the dons he earned the kind of modest reputation that tempted nobody to prophesy anything remarkable . In his father 's letters the suggestion of a diplomatic career was renewed , and with this in mind Charles mentioned the matter to his tutors . It seemed to be looking rather high and far for a first-year undergraduate , but they steered his studies slightlyTIME AND TIME AGAIN 45in the required direction , emphasizing modern languages and political science . He found he had a knack for languages , and during that first year something happened that was specially fortunate  --  Andre Brunon , who had been the arts master at Brookfield , took a post at a school in Cambridge , so that Charles and he were able to continue their earlier friendship . Not only did Brunon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their agreement to talk always in French Charles was given an opportunity which he used to the full . He and Brunon would spend many an afternoon together in and around the town , finding old buildings or street scenes that offered material for sketches ; sometimes they went further afield to Grantchester and Madingley and Ely , cycling with painting gear strapped to their machines . Charles had always thought he would stick to water colors , but Brunon introduced him to the art of oil painting , and thus a new world was opened . The extra satisfaction of it all was that he need never regard time with Brunon as a self-indulgence , since they chattered all the while ; and Charles knew he was acquiring not only conversational ease , but the beginnings of an ability to think in French . " And you have also an ear for accent , " Brunon told him . " This is important in French as it is in English . Either you must speak French like an Englishman , which is bad but permissible , or you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself am not the right kind of Frenchman , so it will be advisable for us soon , Charles , to stop talking French and revert to English . " Charles asked what Brunon had meant by saying he was not the right kind of Frenchman . " I am from the Midi . Any Parisian hearing me speak would know that . " " Does it matter ? " " A little . Nothing to hinder you from passing examinations here , but still , the accent is not socially correct , and you will soon be copying it so well that you would cause raised eyebrows at the Quai d'Orsay . It would be like a French Ambassador arriving in London and paying his respects to your Foreign Minister46 TIME AND TIME AGAIN in perfect grammatical English but with a set of Cockney vowel sounds . " " Rather amusing to think of . " " Yes , but you would wonder where on earth he could have picked them up  --  and then in your mind there would just be the faintest beginnings of doubt about him . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight Irish lilt , all you would think would be , how charming , he must have had a Scottish or an Irish governess as a child .... There is no logic about these matters , but it is rather odd that the native accent of your capital city is so out of favor . . . . Personally I like Cockney , it has a real music of its own , but then I also like a made-up bow tie , which saves me trouble , though I was once told that no Eng- lish gentleman would ever wear one . " " Oh , really ? I did n't know that . " " Do you wear one yourself ? " " No , I tie my own , but it certainly never occurred to me that . . . " Charles laughed and added : " Oh well , Andre , you listen for danger and give me the signal when we 'd better start talking English again . " In the summer of 1920 Charles took Part One of the History Tripos , getting a Second in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tutor congratulated him so warmly that the inference might have been drawn that only brilliant people got Firsts . Charles , how- ever , still hoped to do better in Part Two , which he would take a year later . It was a more specialized examination that included the submission of a thesis , and he had already thought of a subject  --  " The Influence of the Arabian Caliphate on the Seljuk Turks during the Reign of Toghrul Beg . " Why he chose this he was never quite sure , apart from his general interest in the period . Perhaps a deciding factor was that , so far as he could discover , nobody had ever written a Tripos thesis about the Seljuk Turks before . To his tutor , who approved the idea , there also occurred the comforting thought that a researcher on such a subject would soon reach a point at which he knew more than the examiners. 1 1 Nl r tH IN L 1 1 1Vl r ti u t1 1 IN Z 1Those years at Cambridge immediately after the Armistice were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don would have brought up conditions after the Napoleonic Wars or the Great Rebellion or the Dissolution of the Monasteries . There was always this flavor in the Cambridge spirit  --  a willingness to accept the new because it was not really new at all , or at least not as new as an outsider might think . Perhaps it was easier , in this spirit , to welcome the older generation of undergraduateswho crowded the colleges in 1919  --  married men and fathers , strange men , maimed men , and mystery men whose normal lives would not have included Cambridge at all , but whom the war had used and spared and had finally enriched with this unlooked-for experience . Many were from the Dominions  --  rangy six-footers to whom even the mildest collegiate discipline was irksome , and who were apt to find snobbery rather than enchantment in all tradition . And along with them , of course , was the usual crop of youngsters fresh from the schools , the handful of Harvard-exchanged Americans , and that winnowingof dark-skinned empire-built plutocracy which university regulations so tactfully referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parentage . " The mixture was never quite as before , and sometimes did not mix , nor did the spell always work ; but Cambridge , where the spell was everything unless Cambridge was nothing , could only do its best . ( Those were the days when Kolchak marshaled cavalry against the masters of the Kremlin ; those were also the days when , hardly more than a stone 's throw from Charles 's college , Rutherfordwas plotting the split of the atom . But nobody threw that stone . ) Charles spent all his vacations ( except part of one ) at Beeching . The exception was a week in Normandy with Brunon duringthe August of 1920 . They landed at Dieppe and hired an old Citroen ; then they drove to Yvetot and Jumieges , loitering and painting wherever they saw what they wanted . The whole week was full of wonderful weather , warm and sunny but not cloudless , ideal for obtaining a variety of light and color . Charles48 TIME AND TIME AGAINhad never in his life been so happy , not only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to sense a relationship with paint which could be called control , though it was far from anything that could be called mastery . " It is just possible , " said Brunon , " that you might be fairly good someday . Probably not very good , but at any rate better than I am . But of course I am not really good at all . After all , I just amuse myself . " Charles returned to Beeching bronzed from the sun , and with a new confidence in himself that expanded far outside the realms of art into the traffic of everyday life . Havelock was quick to recognize it and asked many questions about Brunon . " He sounds a decent sort of fellow , " he remarked . " To admit that he 's not a good painter and that he has a bad French accent  --  a rather surprising modesty in one who has so much influence over you . " " It is n't exactly an influence , " Charles said . " We just like each other and have similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " On some things , yes . We exchange opinions a great deal because  it helps my French . " " Naturally . " Havelock mused a moment . " Which reminds me . . .. Charnock will be here next week . I told him the portrait of your mother seems to be fading a little  --  he wants to see it and tell me what to do . Perhaps you 'll be equally interested in his opinions . " " Why , of course . I 'll enjoy meeting him . " Charnock had been one of the fashionable portraitists of an earlier day ; he had painted Charles 's mother soon after her marriage , and the full-length canvas hung over the hall mantelpieceat Beeching in deserved pride of place , for there was no other picture in the house of any value . It showed her standing on the terrace holding in leash the two Airedales who were ancestorsof the animals they now had ( there was an Airedale traditionat Beeching ) . Charles had often admired the portrait , not only with his eyes but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49Charnock was old now , in his seventies , and nobody took much notice of what he still regularly sent to the Academy , but he was sometimes asked for his views of younger exhibitors , and these were often pungent enough to make good copy in the newspapers . His own style was somewhat after Millais and the pre-Raphaelites , paying much attention to dress . Nobody could , or would , paint a fold of velvet to look more like a fold of velvet . Charles had no intention whatever of showing Charnock his work , any more than an amateur pianist meeting Schnabel at dinner would ask him to sit by the piano afterwards to hear a Beethoven sonata . Besides which , Charles rarely painted at Beeching , feeling the place curiously out of bounds for doing so with any pleasure . Many of his canvases , including several he liked , were stored in his rooms at Cambridge ; others were in a studio in St. John 's Wood that Brunon rented during school vacations . Brunon had promised to find frames for some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only therefore was Charles surprised when Charnock after dinner asked to see some of his work , but there was n't much to show him . He went to his room , nevertheless , and found a few samples  --  water colors of Cambridge scenes , a head of an old man dozing in a cafe at Lillebonne  --  sketched and then painted from part-memory ; a still life improvised on a wet day in his college rooms ; a landscape in oils of the fens near Waterbeach . He showed these to Charnock with embarrassment , partly because he hated to impose on a guest , but also because it was the first time his father could have seen most if not all of them . Charnock kept silence for a long interval when the display was over and while Charles thankfully stacked the pictures against the wall . Presently the old man cleared his throat and commented : " Well , my boy , you certainly must have had a lot of fun . " " Yes , " agreed Charles . " I would n't have done them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " I 'm afraid the great paintershad more serious motives . . . would n't you say so , Charnock ? " 50 TIME AND TIME AGAIN " Oh yes , but fun 's all right too . " Charnock grinned . " I never found it did any harm to a painting to enjoy painting it ... . But I suppose what you really want me to tell you , my boy , is whether you ought to take it up for a living . " Charles had n't wanted this at all ; he had no intention of trying to become a professional painter , and if this were the assumptionhe felt himself to be falsely a suppliant for Charnock 's opinion . Evidently his father had caused the misunderstanding and there was no way now of clearing it up without being rude to a man whose work Charles admired and respected . So he just smiled back and said nothing . " And you want me to be frank ? " Charnock continued . " Well yes , of course , sir . " Charnock nodded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was as if Havelock were gently prompting him to exploit the fullest possible drama of the occasion . Then Charnock began , puffing between the words : " In that case , my boy , the answer is fortunately simple . You have nothing but a talent . A nice talent , and one that may continue to give yourself and others pleasure , but beyond that . . . " He shrugged again . Havelock turned to Charles . " I hope it is n't a big disappointment , Charles , but I think you 'll agree it 's far better to have it now than nourish an impossible hope . " " I never had such a hope , so there is n't any disappointment , " Charles answered . Which was true , and yet in a way not entirely true . For there was always the hope that one admitted to be preposterous  --  like wondering what one would do with the money if one 's sweepstaketicket won the first prize . Charles , had he ever been asked , would have told anybody ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than talent ; but he did not enjoy being assured of it by a man whose opinion he valued but had n't sought , and in front of his father , who ( he was now convinced ) had planned the whole thing as some kind of personal humiliation . Later he began to wonder if it might be simply revenge for the week he had spent away from Beeching with Brunon . TIME AND TIME AGAIN 51One day in the spring of 1921 Charles left Cambridge by an early train to spend the day in London . His researches into the Seljuk Turks had reached a point where Cambridge libraries had nothing more to offer , but there were several sources at the British Museum that he thought might yield something . The morning was wet and he was glad to exchange the chill of Londonstreets for the leathery warmth of the great Reading Room under the dome . After he had searched the catalogue and filled in slips he found a desk and read the paper while he waited ; there was nothing much in the news  --  riots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reparations , a murder at Golder 's Green  --  just an average cross section of daily mishap . It was really more satisfying to stare about and observe the familiar types  --  students planning success in examinations , as he was ; droll characters probing crannies of knowledgefor the strangest morsels ; tired-looking gleaners who Charles imagined might be free-lance journalists gathering material for the kind of article they would never sell . Once the Museurn official who brought his books had leaned over to whisper : " Know who used to sit at your desk , young man ? Karl Marx . .. . And you know where Lenin first met Trotsky ? ... In the street  --  in the middle of the night  --  just round the corner from here . " Charles had been interested , though Marx , Lenin , and Trotsky were no particular heroes of his . But he was young enough to find a thrill in feeling so close to the kind of history that seemed alive in newspapers , rather than dead in books . The books arrived , and Charles busily made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he could return to it later and strolled along the corridor to the Museum restaurant . It looked full , so he reclaimed his hat and coat and scampered down the long Grecian flight into the open air . He was in a mood for scampering . The rain had stopped and a watery sun was pushing aside the edges of cloud and trying to dry the streets. 52 TIME AND TIME AGAIN He felt happy . He could have painted those clouds . He had done a good morning 's work and he would do more during the after- noon , and then catch the 7:15 back to Cambridge , eating dinner on the train . That would give him plenty of time to be in college before midnight ; and the next day he could sort out his notes and fit them into the thesis where they best belonged . It seemed a shadowless program as he entered the stream of hurrying Londoners outside the Museum . There was a Lyons teashop nearby , but this too was crowded and the only vacant chair he could see was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than waiting , though , and as he only wanted a sandwich and a cup of coffee he threaded his way across the room . Suddenly he saw that the other occupant was a girl ; or rather , the girl whom he saw to be the other occupant gave him a sudden emotion . There was no special reason for it ; she was not prettier than average , and in her rather shabby mackintosh and with wisps of rain-wet hair a little disarranged over her forehead she must be aware , if she were giving it a thought , of not looking her best . Clearly she was not giving it a thought . She was reading a book and seemed engrossed ; when Charles sat down she did not look up , and this gave him a chance to observe her more carefully . All the time the emotion he had had on first seeing her persisted , and meanwhile something else happened that he would not have noticed except at a moment of heightened intensity  --  the sun broke the edge of another cloud and a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene then as he would al- ways remember it  --  the slopped tables and muddied floor , the clothes rack hung with coats and dripping umbrellas , the sign pasted on a mirror that read : BAKED BEANS ON TOAST NOW REDUCED TO FIVEPENCE . He also saw that the book she was reading was a novel by Compton Mackenzie called Guy and Pauline . She was rather pale , and though her eyes were on the book he guessed they were large ; the small finger that turned the pages had a dark stain on the tip . He felt like a detective when he decided that this was not merely from ink but from typewriter-ribbon ink , He gave his order to the waitress , and continued the diagnosis till the sandwich and cup of coffee arrived . Then he ate and drank slowly , and throughout all this time she had not once looked up . The book , he thought , must be surpassingly readable . But he was glad , in a way , because it enabled him to continue his detective role . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bath bun . That was not much of a midday meal for an office girl  --  perhaps it was all she could afford . But then he imagined the same deduction being made about himself , from similar evidenceon the table ; and he wished it were she who would look up and be interested enough to make the mistake . She did n't . Presently , though , she glanced at the clock on the wall behind , put a marker at the page she had reached , grabbed her bill , and hurried to the cash desk . Charles stayed for a few minutes , then picked up his own bill and left . " Just like April , " said the cashier as she gave him change . He was puzzled for a moment till he saw that the sun had gone in and another shower was beginning . He had to walk through it back to the Museum. c , o7All afternoon , and during the train journey to Cambridge , and on and off during the days of work that followed , Charles found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , he had never thought so persistently of any girl before . Amorous adventurehad so far in his life been of a kind to make him think its pleasures exaggerated , or at least overcompensated for by regrets and confusions ; and the girls he met fairly often were mostly the daughters of Beeching neighbors , horsy or hockeyplaying . They thought him shy , which he was , and dull , which he was not ; he had sometimes hoped that one of them might discoverthis . As for the Newnham and Girton girls who attended the university lectures , he hardly knew any of them except by sight , and the sight was rarely blood-tingling . Perhaps , he feared , he was impossibly hard to please , since he did not seem to care for either the bluestocking or the sportswoman type . One thing he did with a promptness that startled him ; he54 TIME AND TIME AGAINbought Guy and Pauline at Heffer 's and read it at a sitting . It was charmingly written , but he thought Guy was a bit of a prig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at odds with the entire idyll . His surviving interest , when he came to the last page , was with the girl in the teashop  --  why had she found the story so absorbing ? Of course it was quite possible she had n't . Maybe she merely preferred a novel  --  any novel  --  to reading a newspaperor chatting with the girls she worked with all day . And maybe she always read like that  --  with an air of having surrenderedtotally to a spell . The following week , term ended for the Easter vacation and Charles decided to put in another hour or so at the Museum on his way home . He planned to catch an afternoon train from Paddington to Stow Magna , which was the station for Beeching ; but while he was making his notes , with one eye on the clock , it occurred to him that he need n't hurry unless he wanted to , since there were later trains and it was of small consequence when he arrived . Relaxing , he then forgot the time till he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along he would revisit the Lyons teashop . He found a table near the one he had had before , but he could not see the girl anywhere , and while he watched the entrance the whole thing seemed to become both fantastic and of increasing importance . How absurd , he reflected ; but what was absurd ? Was it not his own folly , if it mattered to him so much , in not speaking to her when he had had the chance ? The thought made him decide not to repeat the absurdity if ever he were granted a second chance . An hour passed . The appetite he had felt at the Museum had deserted him ; he could hardly finish his coffee and sandwich . He told himself he would leave at a quarter past two and that would be the end of it . Quarter past two came and he still stayed . She walked in five minutes later . The shop was half empty by then , and of course she went to another table , but not far away . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitress knew her and they exchanged aTIME AND TIME AGAIN 55friendly greeting . Her smile was somehow what he had expected , except for a little gap between one upper tooth and the next one , at the left side ; this was pure caprice , unimaginable beforehand in any mind 's eye . When the waitress had gone he left his table and went over to hers , with a deliberation he knew would be hard to explain when she looked up , as she must ; and almost in panic he realized he had no explanation at all , except the truth which could not be spoken . For the truth was simply that he loved her , if ever the word had , or had had , or would have , any complete meaning for him . She looked up . He blushed , pulled a chair , and said with stammering inspiration : " I wondered if you were still reading Guy and Pauline . . . . Why yes , so you are . " She stared for a few seconds , then glanced round as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables . " Are you Ethel 's friend ? " she asked . " Ethel ? " " Oh , then . . . " She looked apologetic , as if it were she and not he who had precipitated the encounter . " You see Ethel 's friend lent it to her , and then she lent it to me  --  Ethel 's my friend  --  and I liked it so much she told him . He said he 'd like to meet me and talk about it , so she said I was always here for lunch  --  well , nearly always . That 's why I thought  --  but of course  --  if you 're not ... " He said : " No , no . I just happened to be here the other day and noticed what you were reading . You did n't see me . I was interested because  --  well . . . " He struck out for a reason like a swimmer for the shore . " Well , I 'd read the book myself and was interested . " Her eyes widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were large . They were also a deep violet in color . " Oh yes , it 's a lovely story , is n't it ? Even my dad liked it . He said it was so good about gardens . " Charles did not know what to say to this , but it was time to come to terms with her voice , which was not quite what he had expected . Or rather , perhaps , he had simply not used his brains56 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 57about what to expect  --  for he had already deduced her as an office girl with not too good a job . If one did n't know English , he reflected whimsically , one would have found her voice as delightful as her eyes  --  soft and warm and altogether pleasing ; but since one did know the language , one had to admit that her voice was also rather Cockney , and Charles wished it was n't , a few seconds before he asked himself why it mattered . For he had been brought up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of English public schools that a boy with the wrong kind would feel outcast till , by conscious mimicry or slow absorption , he could conform to pattern . And the pattern , of course , was the clipped unregional utterance associated by name with Oxford rather than Cambridge , an utterance based on upper-class standardizations achieved over a period long enough to acquire tradition . She went on , smiling now with complete friendliness : " I 've nearly finished it . Do n't tell me how it ends . " " It 's a sad ending . " " I do n't mind sad endings if they 're real . I mean , I do n't like a happy ending to be dragged in . " " Mackenzie would n't do that  --  he 's too good a writer . But I do n't think Guy and Pauline is his best book . You ought to read Carnival . " " Carnival ? I 'll remember that . . . . Are you a writer ? " " Oh no . " But then he recollected what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at present I 'm working on a thesis . " It was clear she did n't know what a thesis was , and he did n't hold it against her . " Something I have to do at Cambridge . " Her eyes widened again . " Cambridge ? You 're at Cambridge College ? " The question had n't been put to him before in that form , and because he did n't want to make her seem ignorant or himself pedantic , he answered : " I 'm a student at the University , but I come to London sometimes to look up things at the British Museum . . . . Now it 's your turn . Tell me what you do . " There was no check on the conversation from then on . Shesaid she was a typist at a firm of importers with offices in Kingsway . She had a boss named Mr. Graybar . She was eighteen . She lived with her parents at Linstead , and Linstead , she explained , was near Chilford . ( Charles had heard of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs . ) Her father was a superintendent of local parks . ( She spoke the word " superintendent " with pride . ) She had two sisters and a brother . Anotherbrother had been killed in the war . That led him to tell her , with no reticence at all , about Lindsay . " He was five years older than I. He was going to have a wonderfulcareer  --  everybody was sure of that  --  he 'd already taken a brilliant degree . He was good at everything  --  games as well . He could ride beautifully  --  some of those big fellows that I was alwaysscared of  --  " " Where do you live ? " she interrupted . " In the country . Cheltenham 's the nearest town . " " What 's your dad ? " she then asked . The question closed and barred the door that Lindsay had opened wide , for the thought of his father made Charles suddenlycautious . To discuss his family and Beeching might set a distance between them , and he could not take such a risk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already there must be later stages ) . He said guardedly : " You mean his job ? He does n't actually have one , except . . . " And then he floundered because the words seemed ill-chosen  --  would she think he was telling her that his father was out of work ? He went on , trying to correct the wrong impression , if any , without conveying the right one : " We have a bit of land and he looks after it most of the time . " " Oh , I think it 's wonderful he sent you to college . My dad let Bert stay on at the grammar school till he was sixteen . " So she had misunderstood ? Charles could n't be sure . Anyhow , it was as if she were pridefully seeking to match either her own father 's financial sacrifices or his devotion to learning with anyone else 's in the world , and this drew his hand across the table to hers in a warmth that made their first physical contact some-58 TIME AND TIME AGAINthing to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color spring to her cheeks , and she glanced at the clock while his hand was still on hers . " Oh dear , I must run  --  Mr. Graybar will make such a fuss . It 's our busy day with the Japanese mail going out . " " Japanese mail ? " " Yes , we do a lot of business with Japan . And China . " " Are your hours long ? " " Nine till six . " " Work hard ? " " Not so bad . It comes in rushes . That 's why I 'm so late today . I have to go , really . It 's been awfully nice talking to you . " " You say you always come here to lunch ? " " Well . sometimes I go to the A.B.C . in Holborn . But mostly here . It 's nearer . " She picked up the bill . " No , no , let me . . . " " Oh , I could n't . . . . No , really ... . The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too unimportantto argue about , the more so as he did n't know whether she had protested conventionally or because he had said his father had no job . So he said , testing the matter from another angle : " All right , this time  --  but I must see you again . Will you have lunch with me next week  --  one day ? " " I 'll be here , yes . Every day . " He followed her to the cash desk , paying his own bill . He still stayed with her when they reached the street . A clock outside was either five minutes fast or else the one in the teashop had been slow . She noticed it with alarm . " Oh look , I 'm terribly late . " So they scampered together , half running and half walking , along a zigzag of side streets to Kingsway , making plans meanwhile . When they reached the office doorway another clock , confirmingthe one in the teashop , seemed to give them a moment miraculously their own . He said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't I meet you here next week , instead of at the Lyons ? We do n't really have to go there at all , do we ? " " All right . " " Here , then , next Wednesday , at one ? " TIME AND TIME AGAIN 59 " Yes . " She gave him a bright breathless smile . " And I 'll try not to be late , Charlie , but if I am , you 'll know it 's Mr. Graybar . " She ran inside and he stood on the pavement , watching the swinging doors till they were still . She had called him Charlie , so promptly and easily , and no one else ever had  --  neither family nor friends . At Brookfield most boys used last names , except intimates , and those had called him " Andy "  --  a nickname that had then been transplanted to his circle of Cambridge friends because one of them had also known him at Brookfield . She had told him her name was Lily  --  Lily Mansfield , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train from Paddington he could hardly find perspective in a world so changed . He ate the Great Western dinner , his appetite now briskly restored , and staring through the window was almost glad there was a full week before he would see her again  --  a full week to taste the new dimension of events . Toward the latter part of the journey night fell , and then he got out his notes and found to his relief that he could concentrate magnificently . She cozily made room for the Seljuk Turks in his mind . At Stow Magna he took a taxi to Beeching . As the cab swung past the lodge gates into the half mile of carriage drive , he saw a tall figure pacing in circles on the front lawn at a rate that , with its lack of purpose , suggested frenzy rather than exercise . Charles knew it must be his father in one of his " moods , " though what kind of mood was not yet apparent . Maybe deep depression , or maybe a high excursion on the crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were the adjectives which , for want of anything more scientific , Charles gave to the two extremes . The difference between them and the quickened intervals of their recurrence had already become as obvious as the fact that Havelock'seccentricities were increasing as he grew older and as the years denied him more than they offered . It was as if the slowing60 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 61tempo of a powerful physicality had liberated him for forays , while it barred the grand offensives of earlier days . Havelock stopped his pacing when he saw Charles arrive . The first words of greeting as they entered the house together revealed that the mood was " vaulting " this time , which was certainly , of the two , more cheerful to live with . But not always more tranquil . During what was left of the evening Charles discovered the nature of the latest foray . Havelock , it seemed , had just contributed to The Times a letter that was not about birds or tombstones , but ventured into new territory  --  political . Beginning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge , " it had gone on to mention an honorary degree recently conferred there on a leading politician ( named ) and the list of this man 's virtues , as enumerated in the usual Latin speech delivered on such occasionsin the Senate House . Havelock 's contention was that the Latin had not been well translated , and after quoting it he supplied his own " better " version as follows : " Sagacity , Willpower , Integrity , Nobility , Experience . " All of which could have been called a piece of harmless pedantry till Havelock had gleefullypointed out ( to friends , neighbors , and fellow members of his London club ) that the initials of the enumerated qualities spelled the word " swine , " and that The Times editor had thus been magnificently duped . Havelock now expounded this creme de la creme of the jest to Charles in the real or assumed expectationthat he would derive equal enjoyment . Of course Charles thought the whole thing preposterous and a disturbing symptom of his father 's heightened irresponsibility . He could not decide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " my son " had sought deliberately to involve him in unpleasantness ; or whether he had merely surrendered to some euphoria in which his mind ( not for the first time ) operated without judgment . Charles told him frankly that if the story got around it could n't exactly help a budding diplomatic or any other kind of career . " The fellow you called a swine may be the one I 'll be having to ask for a job one of these days . " Suddenly deflated , Havelock then claimed that this had never occurred to him , and that in any case the risk of real harm was trivial . Perhaps it was , Charles admitted ; only time would show . When later the whole incident seemed without result of any kind , Charles could only conclude that the letter had attracted absolutely no attention , and that people to whom his father had talked had merely disregarded him as a crank . Full relief came later still , when The Times proved its unawareness by printing Havelock 's next letter , which was innocuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for the time , during that first week of the Easter vacation , it was only behind a curtain of exasperation that Charles could savor his own private happiness  --  the thought of the Wednesday ahead , the Wednesday he had chosen as just a random day for meeting Lily again , but which already he wished had been Monday or Tuesday . As soon as he saw her pushing through the swing-doors of the Kingsway office he knew she had dressed up , and though she would have looked just as well to him in what she had worn at their first meeting , he was touched . Naturally , as a man , but still more as a man of his class , he had not thought to do anything similar . There were certain things one wore in the country and slightly different fashions at Oxford or Cambridge , and a third set of rules for London  --  none of them more difficult than the the task of choosing a good tailor and paying his bills . Charles had indeed been in a state of high excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as clothes were concerned , he was just going up to town for the day , and anyone who saw him waiting on the platform at Stow Magna would have known exactly that . They shook hands and for a moment were both of them nervous and almost speechless till he raised his arm to halt a passing taxi . " We 'll decide where we 'll go while we 're going , " 62 TIME AND TIME AGAINhe said gaily . And then to the driver : " Trafalgar Square , to begin with . " But he found she had very few ideas about lunch . It seemed that on certain gala occasions she had been to the Strand Palace and the Regent Palace , which she had thought very splendid ; but they were not his style , and since he could not afford Claridge 's or the Ritz , he wondered if she would be disappointed with the kind of restaurant that suited both his tastes and his pocket pretty well . There was one he and Brunon had discovered , called Le Beau Soleil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gilt about it , just a few tables in a plain room , rather grubby menus , and a good cuisine for the price . So he said , taking her arm in the taxi : " Let 's go somewhere I once went to  --  nothing much , but at least it 's quiet and we can talk . " It was n't even quiet ; what he meant was that there was no six-piece orchestra booming out popular tunes to drown conversation or to fill the gap of silence between people who had nothing to say . It troubled him to think that Le Beau Soleil might disappoint her ; but soon he realized how willing she was , at all times beginning with that first one , to go where he took her and to be actively , not merely passively , happy about it . There was a sense , indeed , in which everything that ever happened to her was a gala occasion , needing no particular background to make her enjoy it to the full . They had the plat du jour , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was downstairs from the street level , in a sort of semibasement whose windows looked up beyond a railed area to the pavement . One saw the legs of people passing continuously , but no more of them than that without craning ' one 's neck . Sometimes a pair of legs would stop  --  perhaps to rest , or during the lighting of a cigarette , or for no special reason at all  --  and then proceed again . Sometimes a pair of legs would stop close to another pair of legs  --  a meeting . It was amusing to guess , and then to lean sideways to verify . Once a man stooped and stared , presumably to see if the restaurant was full ; it wasTIME AND TIME AGAIN 63the only outside face they saw , and behind the railings it looked like that of some strange crouching animal in a cage . " But he sees us through the bars , " she said . " Maybe to him it looks as if we 're in the cage . " " I 've often had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Zoo ? " " I 've never been , " she answered . That seemed to him quite amazing . " You 've never been to the Zoo ? " " I 've never been anywhere much  --  except round about where I live . " He found , by closer questioning , that this was true  --  she had visited hardly any of London 's famous sights ; all she really knew of the city was the daily route by bus or tube from the station to the office , plus a few jaunts to cinemas and theaters . She had never been to the British Museum , though it was only a short stroll from where she usually had lunch . But she had been to Madame Tussaud 's , and Charles had n't . " Reg took me . He wanted to see the Chamber of Horrors . " She did n't explain who Reg was , and Charles did n't ask ; but the mere existence of a Reg stirred in him a desire to be the first to take her to all the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression that she had lived a very sheltered life at home  --  and of course there had been the war years during which sight-seeing was n't easy or always possible . She said she had reached the top class at Linstead High School for Girls , and had gone straight to an office job on leaving . " We learned French at school , " she said proudly , " but I do n't remember much now . " This came out when the proprietor greeted them at their table and Charles addressed him in fluent French , resulting in the discovery that Le Beau Soleil was owned and managed by a Greek , and Charles did not know any modern Greek . He realized then , from his dismay , how much he had been wanting to show off in that particular fashion . Suddenly , over a third cup of coffee , she noticed the clock. 64 TIME AND TIME AGAIN " Oh , my goodness  --  a quarter to three . I 'll have to run . Mr. Graybar . . . " " May I say damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that many a time . . . . It 's all right , though  --  we 're not so busy today and I 'll work late tonight to make up for it . . . . But whatever could we have been talking about all this time ? " And that was a question hard to answer . For they had talked unceasingly , yet not about anything important . Just their own everyday affairs , which interested each other the more they were revealed , though Charles was still reluctant to be as frank as she was . It was strange ; he did not mind impressing her with news of Cambridge , and the work he was doing , and his fluent French , but he did not want her to know much about Beeching . Yet perhaps he had been less reticent than he supposed , or else she had intuition about it , for in the taxi on the way back to Kingswayshe said : " Your family are rather well off , are n't they ? " " Oh no , not really . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father often has trouble paying his bills . " " Do you own a lot of land ? " " Just farmland . All of it would n't be worth as much as a few square feet round here . " That was an exaggeration , but he wanted to minimize certain differences between them . Other differences he did n't mind  --  some even amused him . Her naivete , for instance , and her lack of the pseudosophistication that most girls had  --  a lack which he knew had nothing to do with primness or being strait-laced . He noticed this when she declined a cigarette . " You do n't smoke or drink , Lily ? " " Well , I 've tried them both , but Dad does n't like me to , till I 'm older . And it costs money . " " How much do you earn  --  if it is n't something I ought n't to ask ? " " Why not ? . . . Two pounds fifteen a week . " Charles was shocked ; he had no idea that wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she was well paid . " I 'll say that for Mr. Graybar , he 's not mean if you can do your job . He gave me the extraTIME AND TIME AGAIN 65five shillings last New Year without even being asked . Of course I live at home , that makes it easy . I give my mum thirty shillings  --  she wo n't take any more . She 's awfully good to me . " He was beginning to realize already that Lily found most people " awfully good " and therefore easy to excuse , forgive , appreciate , and love . And if love were too strong a word , surely any other would not have been strong enough for the emotion that radiated from her in all human directions . She loved her mother and father , her sisters and brother , the girls she worked with at the office ; she even loved , in a sort of way , the redoubtableMr . Graybar . And she had a bright cloudless mind that threaded the love into the pattern of all her behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited in a traffic block at the corner of Aldwych . A queue was lined up for the gallery of a theater and the usual buskers were doing their turns at the curbside . One of them , singing in a cracked voice almost inaudibleabove street noises , turned to the cab and thrust his cap through the open window . The manner of the appeal was impertinentand the driver gestured him off , as Charles would have also had he not seen Lily fishing in her handbag . " No , no , let me . ... " He managed to find a shilling in his pocket and dropped it in the man 's cap . " You should n't have done that , " she said , when the cab moved away . " Why not ? You were going to . " " But a shilling ! " she protested . " They do n't expect that much . Goodness , nobody could afford to , if it had to be a shilling . " " So you always give to them ? " " If I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good singers , and if they are n't you feel sorry for them . . . . Only a few coppers , of course . " " I 'll bet that fellow did n't need money as much as you do . I 'll bet he makes more in a day than you earn in a week . " " But if people always thought like that they 'd never give anything to anybody . " The cab was making the turn into Kingsway. 66 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 67 " Oh Charlie , I 've had such a wonderful time . I ca n't remember when I 've talked so much . Next time I 'll try not to . " He took her hand in an uprush of exultation that gave his voice a tremor . " Well , when shall it be  --  next time ? Tonight ? What time do you leave the office ? " " Oh no , I 'll be working late , and besides , they 'll expect me at home . " " You could telephone . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you work late then , if they expect you  --  ? " " Just an hour or so late does n't matter  --  they 're used to that . But if I went out for the evening  --  ' " That 's what we 'll do , the next time . The whole evening . The next time I come to the Museum . That 'll be soon . " ( But how soon ? Not before the term began again ? Could he endure such a delay ? ) " What about the week after next ? Wednesday again ? We 'll have dinner . " They fixed a time and a place . There was n't a whiff of coquetry in the way she agreed to what she was so willing and happy to do , and , for that matter , both " the next time " and " the evening " had been her words before his . It was also comforting , up to a point , to think that she probably loved him no less  --  and perhaps more already  --  than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not overwork at the Museum that afternoon , and at Beeching , during the ensuing fortnight , he began to assemble the thesis into final shape . There was much more to be done for the Tripos examination than just that , but he would have all the following term for the rest of it once the thesis was out of the way . He found it hard to work at Beeching , and several times after breakfast he walked the dogs or rode his bicycle a few miles to some hill with a view or a tree-shaded riverbank where he could concentrate on a book till distractions came  --  rain , or a chill wind , or his own thoughts tempting him to dream . One morning he received a wire from Brunon suggesting ameeting somewhere immediately , since Brunon had accepted a post in France and would soon be leaving England . Charles had the idea to invite him to Beeching , and it was arranged that he should come to lunch and dinner and stay overnight . Brunon duly arrived and met Havelock , who turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such times as this when Charles felt , not so much that he loved his father , as that the emotion of loving a father would have been a satisfying one , if he could ever have been given long enough to develop it . During the drive to the station the next morning Brunon hinted at another holiday in France during the coming summer . " We might go to the Cevennes and see those towns built on the tops of hills . I think you would find things to paint there . " Charles answered vaguely , not because the idea did not attract but because his thoughts of Lily made the future hard to delimit . Brunon noticed this and continued : " Well , let me know if you can manage it . . . . Or perhaps you have lost a little of your interest in painting since our Normandy excursion ? " " Not a bit . It 's just that I 'm working so hard and do n't have as much time . " " But you have scarcely mentioned painting while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it in front of my father . He is n't very interested . " Then Charles told Brunon about Charnock 's visit and the opinion of Charles 's work he had expressed . Brunon snorted . " That old porn pier ! What could you have expected ? Pretty ladies on chocolate box lids  --  it is all he is good enough for . " " He did a portrait of my mother . I do n't know if you noticed it  --  over the mantelpiece in the hall . " " I did , but I did not know it was your mother . A very beautiful woman  --  though not , in my opinion , a very notable painting . Just competent and commercial . And who am I , you may ask , to despise either quality ? You are right : I am nobody , and my opinion , as I have often told you , is of no value whatever . " 68 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 69 Charles smiled . " I have a feeling it is , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Genius is a foolish word . It is not a label to be pinned on like a medal . Most likely you do not have it , whatever it is  --  that I will readily admit . Maybe I would not recognize it even if you did have it . I can only say that one of your paintings  --  the one of the ruins at Jumieges on that day when the white clouds were so big , you remember ?  --  I showed that to a friend in Paris . " He mentioned the name of a well-known dealer who had made a fortune by commissioning and marketing the work of the newer school of postimpressionists . Charles forced a mask of nonchalance over his excitement . " And did he say I had any genius ? " " No . " " Did he even offer you a price for the picture ? " " No . But he said something he would not have said if he had been quite sure you had only talent . He said you should go on painting for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let him see something else . " Charles laughed and took Brunon 's arm affectionately . " Ten years , Andre . . . that 's quite a time to wait , is n't it ? Not that I 'd mind a bit . " @ , o &; Wednesday came and he went to London and took Lily to dinner at Le Beau Soleil . They talked till he had to leave to catch the last train that would get him back to Beeching that night ( or rather , early the next morning ) ; and this decided him that next time he would stay overnight at a hotel . He did so the following week , but then there was her train home to consider ; it left Liverpool Street at five minutes past midnight . " Oh no , it is n't the last one , Charlie . Trains go to Chilford every hour all night  --  that 's the station after Linstead  --  but Dad does n't like me to miss the twelve-five . " Of course he suggested seeing her home , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really no need , she was used to the journey alone and her parents ' house was only a few minutes ' walk from Linstead Station . But it was n't merely politeness , he explained ; he really wanted that extra time with her , and since she also wanted it with him she soon relented . So it came about that at one o'clock on a spring morning , full of the scents of trees just breaking into bud , Charles saw Linstead for the first time . Linstead is one of those huge dormitory suburbs of London that have spread till they touch other suburbs on all sides , like adjacent blobs of ink on blotting paper . You never know when you have entered or left Linstead unless you notice the slightly different ornamentation on the lamp posts or a faint change in the texture of the road surfaces . The town has a core of history at its center  --  a few old cottages in the widened High Road and a parish church rebuilt on the site of an earlier one ; but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent without being modern . Streets of small two-story houses were pushed into a then open countryside by the speculative builder during the first decade of the century , their names sufficiently dating them  --  Kitchener , Roberts , Mafeking , Ladysmith . Lily lived in LadysmithRoad  --  Number 214 , which was exactly like Numbers 212 and 216 , to which it was physically joined , sharing the walls of both . For that matter it was exactly like every other house in Ladysmith Road , beginning on one side with Number 2 and going up to 278 , and on the other side from 1 to 277 . Charles had never explored a suburb of this kind , never before having known anybody who lived in one , but he knew somethingof what they were like because every railway out of London in every direction ran through miles of them . The backs of the joined houses passed before the train traveler 's eye in long successions , with gardens reaching to within a few feet of the tracks . Nobody could visit London frequently without sometimes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed all the evidence of individuality that the houses so totally withheld . A paradise of flowers could succeed a littered wasteland in a second of train time ; and on fine days the occupants were all so differently busy  --  boys mending bicycles , men digging , 70 TIME AND TIME AGAINwomen chattering to neighbors across fences or hanging up clothes . Even an animal population throve variously  --  cats and dogs , rabbits in hutches , birds in cages ; and once Charles had seen a monkey in a red jacket strutting along a garden path with its proud owner . But at the front of the houses , facing the street , all was uniform and characterless . The gardens there were small , with no more than a privet hedge to shield the bay windows from stares of passers-by  --  though for added protection the windows themselveswere veiled with thick lace curtains . In Ladysmith Road the bay windows stretched for half a mile without a break , and because the road was so respectable there was not so much as a damaged fence or a house turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , came upon it first at night , when the municipal lamps made a golden lane between structural perspectives that might have been Versailles for all he could see of them . What he noticed most , during that first walk home with Lily from Linstead Station , was that she seemed so thoroughly satisfied with the place . She pointed to the new cinema just opened in the High Road ; she showed him the Carnegie Library and the secondary school and the shopping area which for some things , she claimed , was almost as good as the West End and much cheaper . But what stirred her to real boasting were the trees . Every road in Linstead , she said ( and in Linstead the streets were all called roads ) , had trees planted on each side at intervals of a few yards , so that as they grew they would make long leafy avenues the like of which were not ( she assured him ) to be seen in any other suburb . And who did he think was largely responsiblefor this ? " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was his idea , and at first the Council would n't agree because of the cost , but after a while they tried it in a few of the roads and it looked so nice they did it in all of them . My dad chooses the trees for the different roads  --  for Ladysmith Road he chose laburnum . This is Ladysmith Road . It 'll look lovely in a few weeks . " TIME AND TIME AGAIN 71 " I think it does now . " Which only meant that he was with her still , treasuring the last few moments before he must walk back to the station alone , but not knowing when exactly that last moment would come , since she had n't told him the number of the house . It might be the next one , and too late . So there and then , a few laburnum trees away from Number 214 , he stopped and pulled her into an embrace . He was shy and a little clumsy about it , but she yielded so utterly that he found confidenceas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you surprised ? You know I love you ? . . . Do you ? " " Darling , yes . All along I have . But I did n't know if you . . and now I 'm so happy . . . . " He knew she had answered the question he had n't yet asked , and how like her not to waste time , to let her mind race with her heart . They stood together for a long moment , exchanging words that fell away into speechlessness . Suddenly a large ginger cat sprang from a nearby garden and squirmed against them . She laughed herself out of his arms and stooped to caress the animal . " Midge , Midge . . . . This is Mrs. Carroway 's cat  --  she lives next door . . . . Midge , it 's time I was home , is n't it ? . . . Oh , Charlie , I wo n't sleep tonight and the South African mail goes out tomorrow , we 'll be terribly busy at the office . . , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . good night . . . . Midge , Midge , Midge . . . . " She ran away , waving to him , the cat following her. eA week later Charles returned to Cambridge . On the way across London he met Lily for lunch and it was agreed that he must work hard and without time off till the examination . She not only consented , she insisted on it . Whatever happened , he must not neglect his work , though if she could help him by typing his notes . . . was n't there anything like that she could do ? " Charlie , I know how important the examination is . That 's why I do n't mind not seeing you . We can write , of course , but send your letters to the office because the post comes at home after I leave in the morning . " 72 TIME AND TIME AGAINWithin a week he had written that he must see her sooner , he could n't wait till the end of term , he would take a day off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the better afterward , he was certain . She wrote back a firm No , but after a second letter in which he said her refusal had made it hard for him to work at all , she gave in . Then , when they did meet , it was as if the last barrier had broken down and they could no longer think of their relationship as limitable either by times or places . So thereafter , and throughout the term , meetings were every other week in London  --  on Saturdays , as a rule , since she finished work at one and they could spend the afternoon and evening together . Sundays , of course , she was entirely free , but that would n't have served , because she was expected to be at home most of the day unless she said where she was going and with whom . Without ever discussing exactly why , they both felt they had better keep their relationship as private as possible ; all Charles 's instincts were against letting his father know about her , though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little about him . " Of course they know there is somebody , Charlie  --  and they know you 're at Cambridge College . . . . But my dad  --  well , he 's a bit old-fashioned about some things . " On those Saturdays they went to all kinds of places  --  parks , museums , art galleries , the Zoo , the river up to Richmond and as far down as Woolwich . Sometimes they would take a bus at random and travel " all the way , " wherever it might lead and even in pouring rain ; and then in some corner of a cafe , in an unknown suburb , find shelter and privacy . The hours sped by , no matter where they went . Usually he saw her home before beginning his own return journey , for he had to be back in college by midnight , and this meant catching the last train from Liverpool Street and a wild rush through Cambridge streets  --  scampering and running if the train were punctual , taking a cab if not . He managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , when there was thick fog ; but this enabled him to clamber over the ancient college wall unobserved , following aTIME AND TIME AGAIN 73tradition that was itself quite ancient . He barked his shins and ruined a pair of trousers and felt very adventurous . Those were happy days . Once he took her to the Alhambra where they saw a pale and polite resuscitation of the old-fashioned music hall . But Little Tich was on the program , and though far past his prime , was still incomparable . It was a twice-nightly show and they went again to the second " house , " staying just to see Little Tich . " My mum and dad used to see him when they were young , " she said , enraptured . " That was at the old Collins in Islington . They lived in Islington then . My dad was born there , and my granddad was born in a house that was pulled down to build St. Pancras Station . We 're real Cockneys  --  on my dad 's side . Mum comes from Norfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad traveled for a firm that put water pipes in greenhouses . That 's how they met . He gave her a rose and she gave him a meat pie . They often laugh about it now . Funny , is n't it , to think of your parents just before they see each other for the first time , not knowing what 's ahead  --  " " We 're ahead , " said Charles . " That 's why it 's funny . " But he was thinking that he did n't know where or how his own parents had met , and to change the subject , even in his mind , he added : " So they got married and came to London and lived happily ever after ? " " Oh yes . They have tiffs sometimes , of course . Dad bringing in mud from the garden and things like that . Nothing serious . They both like a quiet life . Most years they go to the seaside for a week . Mum always liked Margate  --  that 's where they had their honeymoon  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So they roam ? " " They generally go to Margate . Or Broadstairs . " Another time , on one of those Saturday excursions , he took a sketchbook with him . In a few minutes , while she watched , he roughed out an impression of the Serpentine on a May afternoon  --  children paddling and couples on the grass and riders close by along the Row . It was not very good because he had been show-74 TIME AND TIME AGAINing off a little , anxious also not to spend much of their limited time on something he would do just as well on his own . If only their meetings could be oftener and longer ; if only he could take a holiday with her as he had with Brunon , driving an old car from village to village with no need to worry about missing trains or getting home late . .. . She was captivated by the sketch and begged it from him . " It 's nothing , " he said , which was almost the truth . " I 've always liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint a little too , when I have time . " He was deliberately casual about it . He wanted her to ask to see his paintings and was slightly disappointed when she did n't , though it would have been hard to arrange if she had . Then he realized that such reticence was part of her entire attitude ; despite willing gossip about her own and her family 's affairs , she was equally willing not to know the things he did not choose to disclose . Likewise she accepted all his suggestions for places to visit , neither in subservience nor indifference , but from a simple pleasure she took in doing whatever he wanted . She was small , physically , and all his own preferences were permanently set by it  --  her height was the right height , the crook of her arm in his had the cozy curve and pressure , beauty to him was in the angle of her upward glance as they walked along . And she was loving  --  in a curious way that warmed the blood , yet cooled the fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street corners and on railway platforms , and always , at the revelation that it was she and none of the hundreds of others that had passed or were passing , something in his mind clicked into certainty , like a key turning in a lock . One evening as he was taking her home they met the Superintendentof Parks enjoying his evening stroll along Ladysmith Road . Naturally she made the introductions , and Charles noticed that after the first instant of surprise she showed little nervousnessor embarrassment , but was clearly moved by an affection for both of them that made the whole encounter cordial . Mr. Mansfield was plump and slow-moving ; the pursuit of horticulTIMEAND TIME AGAIN 75ture under a municipal employer seemed to have given him a special serenity compounded of having a job he both enjoyed and could not lose . His high-pitched squeaky voice and Cockney accent ( much more noticeable than Lily 's ) were odd but not inharmonious with his solid frame and deliberate movements . " So you 're the chap Lily 's bin seem ' so much of litely ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pleased to meet you , Mr. Anderson , I 'm shore . And ' ow d' you like our part of the world ? " " I think it 's very nice , " said Charles tactfully , " especially the trees in all the streets . " " I 'll warrant that 's what she put you up to say . " He was pleased , though . " Not that you ai n't right about the trees . Mike all the difference , do n't they ? . . . You know Linstead ? " " I 'm afraid not , sir . This is my first visit . " Mr. Mansfield chuckled as he relit his pipe . " You do n't ' ave to call me sir . ' What d' you think I am  --  a schoolteacher ? Any'ow , ' ave Lily bring you round some Sunday for dinner . Can promise you a nice bit of roast beef , if you fancy it . " " Thank you very much . " Mr. Mansfield passed on his way with a nod . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with extra warmth . " Well , are n't you glad ? The best things sometimes happen by accident . Now he 's met me he wo n't mind you being out late so often . Or at least I hope he wo n't . Nice old boy . . . . Why . . . Lily . . . what 's the matter ? " " You really like him , Charlie ? You really do ? " " Of course . And remember what he said  --  you 've got to ask me to dinner at your house . " " On a Sunday ? " " Yes , I can take a Sunday off instead of a Saturday . When shall we fix it ? " " Any Sunday  --  if they know in time . You really want to come ? You 'll like my mum , too , that 's certain , but I 'm not so sure about Bert and Reg . " " Who 's Reg ? " At last he had been forced to ask. 76 TIME AND TIME AGAIN " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner with us on Sundays . " On Sundays in summer Ladysmith Road was rarely at its best . The air was apt to be hot and impregnated with smells from a hundred households in which the ceremonial meal of the week was being prepared , and of this meal , though the ingredients were many and various and wholesome , the predominant smell was usually that of boiling cabbage . Ladysmith Road was far higher in the social scale than would have allowed noisy children to play in the gutter or dance to a hurdy-gurdy ; indeed it was higher in the social scale than would have allowed street music on any day of the week ; so instead , on Sundays , there was this vast and cabbagy calm , broken only by the murmur of someone 's piano or the distant grind of trams along the High Road . At one P.M. the pubs opened and the Sunday schools closed , but the nearest pub and Sunday school were round several corners , so that their traffic was straggling and intermittent by the time it reached the laburnums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , like systole and diastole , drew the inhabitants to and from Linstead Station and gave Ladysmith Road , between certain hours on weekdays , the appearance of being actually on the way to somewhere . Charles 's visit to Number 214 was not an entire success , though he did n't think it was either his own fault entirely or that of the Mansfields . Their hospitality was friendly and their roast beef excellent . Charles had seen the outside of the house so often that its interior hardly surprised him ; if at all , it did so by being cozier and more comfortable than he had expected . On the whole he blamed Reg Robinson for the fact that he failed to get over his initial shyness . He was always inclined to be shy with a group of strangers , at Beeching or Cambridge or anywhere else , but at Ladysmith Road it seemed to stay with him more obstinately because all the time he was afraid the Mansfieldswere thinking him stuck-up. 11MS A1V 1J 11Mt . AA11N 1 1Dinner was delayed ( he could gather ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not at the table till after three o'clock , by which time Reg had fully established himself as the life of the party . He banged the piano with slapdash facility , he sang ( in tune but thunderously ) , he played gramophone records of comic songs he had brought with him , cueing the laughter in which he expected everyone to join . Charles , after deploring a first painful handshake , was ready to admit his good intentions , but soon found even this effort hard to sustain ; while Reg , it seemed , saw in Charles the kind of dull fellow whom it was his social duty to wake up at all costs . To assist him he had the natural equipment of a loud voice and a set of verbal cliches and stale witticisms which he unloaded at every chance , evoking shrieks of laughter from Bert and from Lily 's two sisters , Evelyn and Maud . Charles was troubled to notice that Lily also laughed , though perhaps only from politeness ; it soon became clear , though , that Reg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . " Nice bit o ' stuff , ai n't she , Charlie ? " he commented , nudging Charles in the ribs , and Charles could only mumble an affirmative . After dinner they sat in a small glassed-in annex to the dining room while Mrs. Mansfield and the girls cleared the table . Beyond the windows was the garden , neat and pretty as might have been expected , with tall hollyhocks affording a token privacy from neighbors on either side . After an ample meal and in a comfortable chair Charles was ready to relax ; he could have done so , and by now would almost certainly have lost his shyness , but for Reg . Reg was indefatigable , and his range of facetiousnesslimitless . It seemed he possessed a motorcycle and had driven to Cambridge on it with Bert . He gave a vivid description of the undergraduates with their caps and gowns ; indeed he had a snapshot which he produced there and then for general inspection . " You mean the boys have to wear them in the street ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , stupid , that 's in the street , ai n't it ? "  --  Maud turned to Charles with an incredulous : " Do you have to , Mr. Anderson ? " 78 TIME AND TIME AGAIN " Do n't call him Mr. Anderson , he 's Charlie , " said Reg . " Of course he does , do n't you , Charlie ? Looks like a dog 's dinner in ' em , too , I 'll bet . . . . Wonder how I 'd look if I wore ' em up the Mount ? " This caused roars of merriment , during which Charles asked Lily , who was next to him , what the Mount was . " It 's where Reg works , " she whispered , but did not explain further . Maud did , whispering in his other ear . " It 's a cemetery . Reg works for an undertaker . " Charles smiled . At last he saw an opening and claimed his audience by the way he spoke up . " I can understand , then , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly do you do , Reg ? " " I 'm in the office , " Reg answered , not quite comfortably . " You do n't do any  --  er  --  spadework , then ? " " Spadework ? " Reg was at first genuinely puzzled , and puzzlementmade him look sullen . After a pause he said truculently : " I ai n't a blasted gravedigger if that 's what you mean . " Charles was still smiling . " No ? I just thought that some of your jokes sounded a bit as if they 'd been . . . disinterred . " At Cambridge or Beeching it would have raised a laugh , but not at Ladysmith Road . Evidently Reg 's jokes were funny and Charles 's were n't . Indeed a somewhat chilly silence supervened till Mrs. Mansfield broke it by a gentle rebuke to all : " Really , I do n't think we ought to laugh about things like that . " ( But they had laughed , when Reg had first brought up the subject by mentioningthe Mount ! ) Charles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on made no further attempts to challenge Reg in the field of humor . It was perhaps some consolationthat Reg also seemed put out , and presently left to take a walk with Bert . Conversation was easier after that , and Charles gladly accepted an invitation from Mr. Mansfield to tour the garden . It could not have been more than a hundred feet long and twenty across , but it took Mr. Mansfield half an hour to name and explain the various plants and flowers . He had n't spoken much at all insideTIME AND TIME AGAIN 79the house , but the garden made him garrulous . Charles , who loved gardens , warmed to the man 's obvious pride and quiet satisfactions . Presently Mr. Mansfield pulled out an old-fashioned watch and checked the time . " Du n no ' ow you feel , Mr. Anderson , " he said hesitantly , " but round about now I usually ' ave a little stroll . Just ourselves , mind you  --  I do n't ' old with takin ' ladies along , not on Sundays , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily looked equally pleased to see him on such good terms with her father . The two left the house and walked half a mile to the end of Ladysmith Road , then right along Mafeking Road to Roberts Road , then left as far as the Prince Rupert , a modern sham-timbered but decentlookingpub . " Du n no why they call it the Prince Rupert , " commented Mr. Mansfield , as they pushed through the doors . " I never ' eard of no prince named Rupert . " Charles had , but he did not want to seem learned . " Looks a nice place , " was all he said . " Not too bad  --  and quiet , mostly . It 's what you might call the local round ' ere , for those that ai n't teetotallers . . . . What 's yours , Mr. Anderson ? " " Thanks , I 'll have a bitter , " said Charles , beginning to feel more at home than for hours . " But I wish you would n't call me Mr. Anderson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callin ' you Charlie .. . . Ah , good evenin ' , Milly , two bitters for me and this gentleman .. . . Some'ow , though , I thought they was n't treatin ' you quite re-spectful . " " Respectful ? . . . Nonsense  --  why should they ? I 'm no older than any of them , except Lily . " " Well , yes , that 's true , but after all you was a stranger , and that Reg  --  ' e should n't rightly ' ave carried on the way ' e did . .. . Mind you , ' e soon calmed down afterwards  --  you got your own back all right , only I think you ' urt ' is feelin 's . " " I hope not . I certainly did n't intend to . " " ' E 's a nice smart young feller , " Mr. Mansfield continued. 80 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 81 " Always ready with a joke , and  --  like you said , only you was bein ' sarcastic  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun , in a manner of speakin ' . " " I 'm really sorry if I did hurt his feelings , " Charles repeated . " Oh , ' e 'll get over it . Lily 'll tell ' im you did n't mean no ' arm . " The two bitters arrived , and Mr. Mansfield raised his glass toCharles . " Well , Charlie . . . " He paused to let the name achievesignificance , then added : " ' Ere 's to us and our dear ones .... " Lily walked with him to Linstead Station later , and on the way they had their first slight tiff . It was about Reg , whose discomfitureafter Charles 's single crack at his expense seemed to have aroused her sympathy . Like her father , she thought Reg 's feelings had been hurt , but Charles felt in no mood to apologize again as he had done once already at the pub . " Look , " he said , " here 's a fellow digs at me all afternoon and I take it  --  bad jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes off in a huff . " " Not bad jokes , " she objected . " Reg has his faults , but he never says anything blue in front of ladies . " " Blue ? " " I mean the sort of jokes men tell to each other . Reg tells them to Dad , but only when they 're on their own . " " I see . I did n't know that 's what blue ' meant . And you did n't know what I meant by bad . ' I meant silly jokes , not blue necessarily , just jokes that are n't amusing . " " Almost as if we did n't speak the same language , " she said gaily . " Anyhow , Charlie , they made everybody laugh . " Charles had to admit that they had , and that his own joke had n't , and that any further development of that issue might bog down in a philosophical impasse . Was laughter a valid empiricaltest of humor ? If there were no one to see it , could a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bit like the **33;7296;TOOLONG of the medieval scholars . But all that he could hardly go into with Lily , and by this time the fact thatthey , were at odds was beginning to trouble him , as also her suggestion ( shrewd or naive , he was n't sure which ) that they did n't speak the same language . " Oh Lily , " he exclaimed , taking her arm ( they were on the platform and the train was due and he could n't endure the thought of separating from her on clouded terms )  --  " we 're not going to quarrel about it , are we ? " " Of course not . " And of course they were not . " But I ca n't help being sorry you were bored . " " I was n't bored at all . " He had to get back into the argument . " It 's just that a fellow of Reg 's type always makes me shut up in company . I just ca n't compete with them . " " I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he 'd like to have had your advantages , going to Cambridge College to study . He 's really clever , everybody says , but he had to leave school at fourteen . If only he 'd been properly educated it would make all the difference . " " I do n't believe it would , " Charles could not help replying . " I 've met fellows like Reg at Cambridge and I ca n't get along with them there either . You must n't think education changes what people are like . " " Then what does it do ? " she asked , again either naively or shrewdly , and he had no time to speculate , for the train was coming in . He pressed her hand . " Even if I knew an answer it would take me all night to give it to you . " He found a compartmentand leaned out of the window to kiss her . " Maybe you 'd better come up to Cambridge and see for yourself . . . . Yes , why not ? That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I 'll be free and wo n't have anything on my mind . Leave on the Saturday and I 'll get you a room at the Lion or somewhere  --  there 's a good train back on Sunday evening . . . . Will you , Lily ? " " I do n't know if Dad would let me . " " But it 's only fair  --  for you to come and see me once after all the times I 've come to see you . " 82 TIME AND TIME AGAIN " Yes , I know . . . . Oh , I 'd love to , Charlie , but I 'll have to ask Dad first . " " Fine . Ask him . I do n't think he 'll mind . He and I got along all right . " " Yes , you did , did n't you ? " At last they had found something to agree and be glad about , and on this happier note could time their separation . " I knew it when he took you to the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The train was beginning to move . At Cambridge , Charles was thereafter sustained a good deal by thoughts of Lily 's visit . Those were the days just before the examination that ( with the Diplomatic in mind ) might make or mar his career ; and he had better not think it absurd , while he girded himself for last-minute cramming , that what he would be doing thirty years hence might depend on a few thousand facts so chancily selected and forcibly absorbed . The days entered a tunnel of eventlessness , but once the actual examination started the tunnel became dreamlike , streamlike , a silent aqueduct of time . Every evening , after the six-hour ordeal , an entire section of knowledge was banished from his mind , as if it had no longer any business there , so that concentration on the remainder could become more intense . His tutor had warned him not to overdo the cramming , but Charles found he could not sleep even if he went to bed , and it was no harder to read than to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five crucial days he could roughly estimate how he was faring , and he did not think too well . Many questions he had been unable to answer confidently , and there had been few he would have chosen for a display of what he knew . One afternoon he half collapsed over the desk ; the day was hot and the examination hall airless  --  all that , plus lack of sleep , probably accounted for it . An invigilator went out with him for a spell in the open , and Charles found it a strange effort to make conversation , knowing they must avoid mention of anything remotelyconnected with the questions . There was one about theTIME AND TIME AGAIN 83Amphictyonic Council that Charles had been answering at the moment he slumped forward . He was afraid he had leaked his fountain pen all over the page , and he wondered if , in the circumstances , this would matter  --  whether , for instance , he should asterisk the smear with a note of apology : " Here I fainted owing to the heat . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest it , " said the invigilator , after they had walked twice round a small quadrangle . Charles did not guess what he meant till he added : " Though I am unfortunately compelled to accompany you , even to the humblest abode . " He was a lean elderly professor whom Charles had never seen before and whose name he did not know . " Oh no , thanks  --  I 'm all right now . I think I can go back . " " I hope so , Anderson . When I mark your paper I shall try not to be unduly influenced by sympathy . " Charles smiled , wondering what made university dons grow up like that . Yet he was aware of genuine friendliness behind the man 's tee-heeish manner . Back in the hall he found the ink smear already dry and the atmosphere sultrier than ever , but he managed to endure it without further mishap . He had lost half an hour , though , and did n't have time to finish all the questions . One evening , as by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and he returned to his rooms after the last paper had been consigned to whatever fate might be in store for it and for him . He felt somewhat as he had done when the war ended  --  a sense of anticlimax following hard on the heels of relief . But the emptiness soon filled with thoughts of Lily 's visit , which was by now a definite arrangement . Mr. Mansfield had given permission , and even Mr. Graybar had been persuaded to let her leave the office an hour earlier to catch a better train . In a recent note to Charles confirming all these matters , both handwritingand spelling had betrayed her excitement . Saturday ( almost to his unbelief ) was the day following , and he spent half the night sleepless for thinking of it , but quite pleasantly awake for the same reason . In the morning , which84 TIME AND TIME AGAINwas warm and fine , he rose early and bought armfuls of freshcutflowers at the stalls in the Market Square . Then he made plans with the college kitchen for special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned a small dinner party for that evening , inviting his two best friends  --  a man named Weigall , whose rooms were on the same staircase across the landing , and anotherman from Sidney Sussex , whom he had got to know at history lectures . Since the cost of this party would come on the college bill at the end of the term he could indulge himself without any immediate financial problem , and with all the examinations over he felt he had earned the right to do so . His allowance from his father was not inadequate , but it had been stretched pretty far of late by all the traveling back and forth to London and the dinners and lunches and excursions there ; he was beginning to look forward to his next birthday ( his twenty-first ) if only because he would then come into some money of his own . He had already borrowed a little from his Cambridge tailor ( a wealthy and knowing tradesman ) on the strength of this . He felt very proud of her as they rode in an open taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been meeting girls on the same train , and he could not avoid the comparison ; Lily was not so well dressed as many , nor so strikinglypretty as a few , but she had poise and grace and some quality for him of sheer radiance . It was so personal that he was often relieved when he saw others  --  and not only men  --  aware of it ; this seemed to prove he was no victim of love 's illusion , though it also showed that the radiance was not for him alone . Anyhow , her own extreme of pleasure now cast a special halo round it , and he felt doubly exultant . " You 're really here  --  at last ! " he kept saying in the cab , as if the distance to Linstead and London were reckonable in thousands of miles . " Charlie , I always wanted to come here to see you . " TIME AND TIME AGAIN 85 " Then why did n't you suggest it ? Or why did n't I  --  sooner ? It 's so obvious  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want me mixed up with your work . " " You already are mixed up . I see you on every page of Stubbs and Maitland . " She laughed gaily . " And I see you on every page of Mr. Graybar 's dictation . " " Forget Mr. Graybar  --  for two whole days . " He squeezed her arm , and thought that possibly in his own room , sometime during her stay , they would enjoy the privacy they had sought till then in streets that happened to be dark or train compartments that happened to be empty between stations ; he knew this Cambridgevisit was bound to mark a stage in their relationship . He began to point out the colleges . " That 's the first one , Downing  --  I mean the first on the way from the station . The next is Emmanuel . . . . They 're all separate and together they make up the University . So you see why you ca n't say Cambridge College  --  there is n't such a thing  --  if you talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Downing or Emmanuel . " He had always wanted to explain that to her . " How many colleges are there ? " " Over a dozen , I should think  --  yes , at least a dozen . " " Do n't you know exactly ? " " I do n't believe I do , unless I counted them on my fingers . .. . This is Christ 's  --  John Milton 's college . We 'll look round some of them later . . . . Here 's Petty Cury  --  this narrow street , where your hotel is . I think you 'll be comfortable . " He had engaged a room , even going so far as to inspect it before approval ; it overlooked Petty Cury and might be noisy till late at night , but she would n't be using it till then . While she took her bag to it he waited in the glass-roofed lounge . Then she came down , spruced and tidied , and his heart melted to see her against this new background , but at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her visit was only just dawning on him . He also hoped he could sleep better during the corn-86 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 87Iing night ; it was a need , like others he was beginning to be aware of , that went deeper than a desire . Suddenly he wondered what on earth had made him ask Tony Weigall and Bill Peters that evening  --  how much cozier just to have dinner on their own , with no strangers intruding when once Debden had cleared away and said good night . They crossed the center of the town to his college , which he was anxious to show her first , as a sample , though it was not the oldest or one of those most visited by sight-seers . She was much impressed by the salute the porter gave him as they passed into the First Court , and surprised by the narrow staircasethey had to climb and the double doors he had to open to get to his top-floor rooms , and entranced by the rooms themselves  --  so much larger and grander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chapel and the library and the hall , where he showed her the ancient tables and the Holbein and the piece of wood , shaped like a hand mirror , that had printed on it the college grace which he had taken his turn to read aloud until , with no particular effort of memory , he had come to know the long Latin paragraph by heart . Then they strolled along the Backs and looked into King 's Chapel till it was time to return to his rooms , when it was revealed to her ( by the most plausible of circumstances ) that seventeenth-century college rooms lacked some of the basic conveniences of the modern house . She was surprised again , but agreeably unshy about such things and therefore amused . Perhaps because of this he decided to conquer his own shyness about something very different , but in its own way just as intimate ; he got out some of his paintings . He was always reluctant to do this  --  too often he had read in the eyes of people looking at other people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to think of something to say that was clever or at least flattering . It was a test , therefore , that he shrank from putting his friends to , because he shrank from putting himself to it . But now with Lily , acting on impulse , he took the risk . He fixed the easel and placed the canvases on it one by one , saying nothing about any of them , while she sat curled in the window seat viewing them equally without word or gesture . When she had seen the lot and he had put them away again he poured himself a glass of sherry . She still did n't speak , and he began to approve of her silence in a miserable sort of way . At least she was n't dealing out insincere and meaningless compliments . Presently she said : " Charlie , I 'm so glad you let me see the pictures . It 's no good my trying to tell you what I think of them because I do n't know . I liked some better than others . I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was that ? " " The third , I think , or the fourth . " He knew the one she meant ; it was a fenland scene , mainly clouds  --  a windy day , to be sure ( the canvas had been blown down by one of the gusts ) , but there were no obvious clues like bending trees or drifting smoke . What he had tried to do , but did not think he had succeeded in doing , was to get the wind into his lighting of the sky , into the whole surface texture of the picture . And now she was telling hirn he had succeeded . Never had he felt such a moment of utter and blissful reassurance . He went over to her and put his arm round her in full view of anyone who might be passing across the court , and in a curious way he hoped he might be seen , as the finder of a new truth wants to proclaim it . " Lily , my little one  --  my darling . .. . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sorry . Charlie . " " Nothing you say is ever the wrong thing . It 's I who do the wrong things . Tonight , for instance , we ought to have been alone . " " But you asked some friends of yours , did n't you ? " " Yes , I did , and I  --  but no , it 's all right , you 'll like them . They 're good fellows . " " Of course I 'll like them . " The college clock began to strike the hour , followed by other clocks all over the town . The miscellaneous near and distant88 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 89chiming lasted for some time , many of the clocks being minutes fast or slow , and he told her it would all begin again , for the quarter , after about a ten-minute interval . " They 'll probably keep you awake all night . " " I wo n't mind . I 'm so excited to be here . Charlie , d' you know this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ? " " You 're not by yourself . " " I mean at night . . . without a friend . " " What friend ? I did n't know you had any other particular friend . " " Of course I have . I mean girls . There 's Ethel at the office  --  we always go away on our holidays together . And there 's Phillis Baxter I used to go with at school . You have n't met them because every time you 're free I 'd much rather be with you . " " A good answer . " " Do n't you believe me ? " " I do . And it was a windy day in that picture . It was , indeed . " In the mood he was in , torn between exultation and regret , between the wish that they were alone and the hope that his friends would like her , and over it all the tensions that had not been eased by sleep , he could hardly understand himself , much less expect her to understand him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sharp , as if you were nervous about something . " It was because he had heard Weigall and Peters coming up the stairs . Within a few minutes he was relieved at least on one count . Weigall had draped his long legs from the far end of the couch and Peters was at the nearer end , and in between , laughing and chatting as if she had known them for years , was Lily . It came out that Weigall 's family were from Norfolk and that Lily too had relatives there ; they talked about Norwich and Sandringham , and other places they both knew . With Peters , who was a historian , Lily found less in common at first ; but soon they discovered a shared interest in films , Peters being something of a highbrow while Lily was just an ordinary regular patron of whatever the Linstead cinema offered . Peters seemed to find her com-ments both amusing and delightful ; and when Debden announced that soup was served Peters insisted on sitting next to Lily , althoughCharles had planned to have Weigall there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did n't much matter how they sat . What did matter , as Charles began to notice it , was that Peters was bringing Lily to a kind of life Charles had never seen in her before . Charles even wondered whether he had ever been jealous before , for the glum and spiritually disablingsensation he felt was new in his experience . Lily was telling Peters about a dog they had had at LadysmithRoad when she was a child , and it appeared that Peters also liked dogs and that his family had had one of the same breed . " There 's nothing like a dog , " Peters assured her . " Except a cat , " said Lily . " We have a lovely cat . " " But a cat is n't really like a dog , " said Peters . Weigall winked at Charles . " Too intellectual for me  --  this conversation , " he commented . " We have two Airedales at Beeching , " said Charles , suddenly desperate to assert himself . Peters laughed . " You see , Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . . . and how many horses , cows , housemaids , butlers , grooms , and other domestic pets ? I do n't suppose Andy knows  --  he 's never bothered to count . " " Ile did n't even know how many colleges there are in Cambridge , " said Lily , extending the joke . " Did you , Charlie ? And you never told me they called you Andy , either . " Charles was concerned lest she should gain an exaggerated impression of Beeching from Peter 's nonsense , but he was also astonished  --  and perhaps dismayed  --  that Lily seemed to be impressed so little . It was the " Andy " she had picked up . " It 's just a nickname I had at school , " he explained , adding rather foolishly : " From Anderson . " " Really ? " Weigall gave himself an ironic poise . " I think we can accept that as a hypothesis . " He intoned in imitation of some90 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 91professor . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " This kind of thing was lost on Lily . " Well , " she said , " when I was at school we were told how many counties there are in England . " " What a depressing school it must have been ! " " It was not ! It was better-looking than some of these old colleges . " Weigall assumed his most languid air . " Better-looking , Lily ? " " Newer . More modem . I tell you , Linstead 's an up-to-date place . You should see some of the parks we have . My dad 's the superintendent of them . " Peters abruptly seized Lily 's hand across the table . " Lily . . . ignore these other two and listen to me . First , I congratulate you . To have a father who superintends parks is magnificent . My own father , God bless him , is a coal miner . Lived in the same cottage for thirty years  --  a cottage in a town where there are no parks and consequently no superintendent of parks . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he still works in the pits . But by sheer grit and ability his son , whom you see here in a preliminary stage of intoxication . . . by sheer . . . whatever it was I just said . . . plus , of course , an army grant and a scholarship and sundry other assistances . . . has been admitted to this ancient seat of learning to study , ape , and acquire the manners and customs of his betters . . . while still retaining , Lily  --  and this is important  --  that innate sympathy with the working classes that makes him salute you , as he does now , in profound adoration ! " Charles contrived a smile , but Lily was blushing through the beginnings of tears . " Oh , go on with you , " she murmured , but she did not withdraw her hand . " I 'm not crying because I believe a word you say  --  it 's the way you make me feel . . . . Charlie , does he often talk like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often did , after a few drinks ; but there was n't time to answer at all beforePeters raised his glass and demanded a toast . " To the Labor Party and the working classes , Lily ! " " Oh , that 's a lot of nonsense ! " she retorted . " My dad votes Conservative ! " She would n't drink , but she turned to them all with a rosy smile , finally settling it on Charles . " Darling , it 's such fun being here . . . . I did n't know clever people could be so silly . " we ) The rest of the evening passed for Charles in a fog of sensations , one of which was amazement at the new dimension of personalityLily was revealing . It pleased him up to the point where it began to hurt . He had feared that Weigall and Peters might not like her , or that she might be too nervous to talk to them , and though he was glad he was wrong he was not quite at ease enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was something . The party could not last much longer , for by midnight according to university rules Lily would have to be out of college and Peters back at his lodgings across the town . When half past eleven struck and Peters did not make a move , it was Lily who picked up the signal . " Ought I to go , Charlie ? You tell me when . " Peters said : " Do n't fidget , Andy  --  she does n't have to leave till a few minutes to twelve . " " But I have to get back here before they shut the gates , " Charles said . " You do n't have to go at all . I can drop her at the Lion  --  it 's right on my way and I 'm in rooms  --  my landlady never says a thing if I 'm a few minutes late . " Charles felt himself challenged by some test of fair-mindedness , logic , magnanimity , reasonableness , and other qualities which he admired . He did n't exactly consent to the arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , and about five minutes to twelve Peters left with Lily . She was evidentlythrilled that he was wearing a cap and gown and would thus escort her , and it was just Charles 's bad luck not to have92 TIME AND TIME AGAINgiven her this pleasure himself , for academic costume in the streets was at all times permissible , though not compulsory till after dark . While the departing footsteps were echoing down the staircase and across the court to the gateway , Weigall lit another cigarette . He , being of the same college , could stay as long as he liked . " Good company , " he commented . " You think so ? " " For her age .. . must be very young . You know , Andy , when you first mentioned a girl coming up to see you , I thought she was a friend of the family or something . " " What do you mean ? " " Well  --  er  --  is n't there some girl that your family hopes you 'll marry someday ? There generally is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with huge front teeth and lots of money . Thank God your little Lily is n't like that . " " No , " said Charles , " she is n't like that . " Weigall went on : " She 's charming , and she has a bright eager mind that 's a joy to make contact with . I think I could ring most of my change on her counter  --  when she 's a little older . What puzzles me is where you could possibly have picked her up ? " " Why is it such a puzzle ? " " Because . . . I suppose I somehow did n't think of you as a picker-up  --  not in that sense . " " What sense ? " " Oh , come now , Andy , have a heart ! Do n't you want me to talk frankly ? I 've told you I like her , and that 's the truth , but unless she 's destined to be your future wife do I have to pretend you were introduced by the vicar of Beeching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I met her in a Lyons teashop in London . Her father , as she told you , works for the local council in a suburb . They live in a small house in one of those terribly long streets  --  not a slum  --  just dreary and respectable .

Socially I suppose you 'd call her lower middle class  --  " TIME AND TIME AGAIN 93 " Good God , " Weigall interrupted , " who cares about class nowadays except smart fellows like Bill Peters ? He 's a snob in reverse  --  one of these days he 's going to make that miner 's cottage business pay off like a bonanza . Whereas you and I , Andy , are stuck in between  --  we were n't born at Blenheim or Chatsworth on the one hand , and on the other hand we did n't starve in tenements or pick crusts out of gutters . . . . We just come from country homes with bits of land and families that go back a few centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Well , that 's not quite true in your case , your father has a knighthood , but I gather he earned it , which is bad . . . . I tell you , Andy , in the world I see coming our background  --  yours and mine  --  is going to be a pretty fair handicap . We 'll be the excluded middle  --  if you 'll pardon a logician 's term . So prepare to defend yourself , not Lily . She 's all right . She 'll sleep well tonight  --  she has n't our worries . You look worn out , by the way . Why do n't you get to bed ? " " Yes , I think I will . Thanks , Tony . " " Thanks for what ? I have n't given you any advice .. .. Good night . " But again Charles could not sleep and heard the quarters maddeningly till nearly dawn . Then he got up and crossed the courts to the new bathhouse ( built as a postwar innovation in collegiate life ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had promised to have breakfast with Lily at the Lion at half past ten , but after eight , when the college began to come to life , time passed most slowly of all . Debden , who was doubtless curious about Lily , chattered with his usual amiable inquisitivenessas he tidied up the room , venturing to observe that it would be " a lovely day for taking the young lady on the river . " Charles agreed . " Yes , I might do that . " And so he might . He had not made definite plans , hoping that Lily might care to spend part of the day quietly in his rooms . She was a few minutes late coming down to meet him at the94 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 95Lion , and while he waited in the lounge he wondered about Peters and her the previous night . Had they talked till much later , at the hotel , and was this why she was late ? Peters had said his landlady would let him in after midnight without making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , that . . . but no , it was not only impossible , it was absurd . . . and anyhow , here she was . " Charlie , I 'm sorry . Been waiting long ? " " No , I only just got here . Did you sleep well ? " " Wonderfully . The clocks did n't bother me at all . . .. Oh , what a lovely time I had last night . " " You did ? I 'm glad . I had an idea you 'd like Weigall and Peters . " " Oh yes , they 're nice . " " Peters especially . Did he talk to you much on the way ? " " All the time . He does talk all the time , does n't he ? But of course it was only a few minutes . It 's really a small town to walk across . " " Compared with Linstead  --  and when you 're in amusing company . " " Oh , you ca n't compare it with Linstead . And I 'd much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , it would have meant leavingearlier . " " I think it was Peters , actually , who made the arrangement . " " Was it ? " " It does n't matter . " He seized her arm clumsily . " Lily , you must forgive me  --  I 'm being foolish . One good night 's sleep and I 'll see everything straighter . . . . Do n't take me seriously now . Let 's have breakfast . " During the meal he felt happier , relaxing in her company and in her obvious pleasure to be with him . But she was troubled about his earlier mood . " Charlie , what 's wrong ? Why ca n't you sleep ? " " Overwork , I suppose , these last few weeks . Nothing to worry about . " " And taking all those days off to see me . You should n't have done that . " " On the contrary , they kept me going . " He laughed uncertainly . " I probably ca n't live without you , Lily . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . It was one of the few times she had touched , even as lightly as that , on the notion of a future . " They 'd better not . " She caught the grimmer note in his voice . " Do n't be cross about something that has n't happened . " " I 'm not cross about anything , really . Not when I 'm with-you . " " Maybe you 'll sleep better tonight . " " After you 've gone ? I wonder . " " If those chimes keep people awake at nights I do n't know why they have them . " " Probably because they 've had them for years and years and years . In Cambridge that 's a good reason . " " Never mind , you 'll be on your holidays soon . It 's country where you go home to , is n't it ? That 's one thing about the country  --  nice and quiet . " " Not always nice and sometimes too quiet . What will I do there now I have n't got an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more examinations sometime ? " " That 's a cheerful idea . " " Well , I thought if you wanted something to do . . . . But if I were you I 'd just take a rest . Bill told me you 'd been working too hard . " " Bill Peters ? He would n't know  --  he 's in another college . Besides , nothing 's hard work to him . I mean , he takes everything in his stride  --  examinations , sports , debates , even acting at the Footlights . Just like my brother Lindsay who died . One of those all-round fellows . Sure to have a career . A First for certain and probably a Blue and President of the Union  --  the whole bag of tricks . Nothing can stop him . . . and I like him enormously . I 'm lucky to have him for a friend . He 's very popular . " " Why are you talking so much about him ? " " Are n't you interested ? You seemed so last night  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 TIME AND TIME AGAINShe shook her head , but in dismay more than denial . " Oh Charlie , it does n't seem to work well , does it , either when you meet my friends or I meet yours ? " " Please . .. . " He struggled with some inward fret that cen- tered round the pit of his stomach . " Please forgive me again . The same old foolishness . The truth is , I wish I could have more time alone with you . Other people somehow seem to get in the way . " " Al right then , let 's be alone . " " For the rest of the day ? That is n't much . " " It 's all we have . I wish it were more too . " Then he heard his longings framing themselves into words that desperately came close and yet fought shy of what they really meant . " Lily , you 're supposed to go back by the 9:12  --  what if you did n't ? Suppose I borrow a car  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our own  --  now  --  this morning . . . and have all the time we can together  --  at some quiet place in the country . . . . And tomorrow I 'll drive you right to the door of your office  --  not too late for Mr. Graybar , I promise . . . . Could you ? Would you ? " She answered immediately and simply : " Yes , if you want . But I must send Dad a wire . " " Tell him you 're staying here another night . " " I wo n't say here , ' I 'll just say staying . ' Then it wo n't be a lie . I 'd hate to tell my dad a lie . " It took him till midafternoon to fix all the details of the sudden change of plan . He had to rent a car ( not as easy on a Sunday as he had thought ) , and secure an overnight exeat from the college authorities ( easy now that examinations were finished ) , and think of something plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  that he was just driving his guest back to Lon- don and would return the next day . Meanwhile she sent the wire to her father . They drove out of Cambridge southward over the Gog MagogTIME AND TIME AGAIN 97hills , toward those rolling Essex uplands that are never high but give every half mile a changing contour . Presently they stopped at a small country town . It had a church with a crocheted spire that Charles would have sketched if he had been less tired , but they were satisfied to look around and then have tea in a nearby cottage . They did n't know where they would drive on to next ; Charles had n't even a map . It was the kind of wandering he had often dreamed of having again , after that week in Normandywith Brunon , and here it was , with her , a reality , yet still enclosed in a dream . As they explored the narrow streets the dream reached to the sky , as if actual sleep , like a great bird , were already wheeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , full of Sunday stillness till they reached a central square , where a Salvation Army band oompahed in the sun without any audience . There was an ancient timbered buildingwhich they crossed the square to inspect ; it was a fifteenthcenturycloth hall , still in use as a municipal office . They passed close to the band on the way back , and as they did so there came over the trombones and tambourines a sound so startling in an Essex town that they stared incredulously . A Salvation Army man approaching with a collection plate grinned at their astonishment and supplied the explanation . " The circus just came in . Starts tomorrow for the fair week . " " Fair week ? " Charles echoed , fishing in his pocket . " Oh yes , we have a real big fair once a year  --  thank you , sir  --  people come from miles around . Just up the road . " He proudly jerked a thumb . " Turn to the right over there by the bank . That 's where you heard them lions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than his own . In a mood to see what was to be seen , they took the indicated direction and soon found why the center of the town was so empty . A crowd that looked like the entire population was watchingthe unloading of a long line of circus vans into an open field . Everything was lively and noisy and smelly ; the lions roared again in their cages , men yelled to each other as they hoisted the big tent , whips were cracked , ponies trotted , men inTIME AND TIME AGAINtop hats and riding boots gave what was halfway a free show . In a field next to the circus there was to be the fair itself ; here men in shirt sleeves were putting up stalls and coconut shies , and unpacking hideous china that would doubtless be given away as prizes . Soon the street lamps gleamed over the scene of such unusual Sunday activity ; naphtha flares were hung on the stalls , and a searchlight began to test itself against the sky . The noise and smells and brilliance increased as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lull the Salvation Army band could be heard still playing cheerfully on and on . During one of those lulls Charles said : " I think all this must be a bit like Nizhni Novgorod . " " What ? " " Somewhere you 've never been and neither have I. It has a fair too  --  every year  --  or rather it did , before the Revolution . Perhaps still does . It 's a place in Russia . I must have read about it somewhere . " " And it 's like this ? " " Might be . I do n't really know why I think so . But a fair 's a fair  --  everywhere . " " Yes , you 're tired , " she agreed , as if that was what he had told her . " You ca n't drive any more . Let 's stay here . " " All right . If Nizhni Novgorod has a decent pub . " The Swan was full , but recommended a cottage round the corner , the hotel being available for meals and garaging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swan sent you . " They told her the Swan had sent them , and the room she offered was under the thatched eaves , small and low-roofed and crammed with mahogany . The cottage was probably three hundred years old , but nobody had bothered much about that and all the walls had florid paper covering the uneven plaster . On the modem mantelpiece there were shells from some seashore and photographs of ( presumably ) Mrs. Renshaw 's relatives . They were a glum collection and Charles was beguiled by their stares of disapproval . Lily was sympathetic , wondering from their faces if they had ever been happy. 1 11V1 r , L11V 11 J. 1 IVl 1  --  . 11 V 1111tl JJ " Of course they were , " Charles said . " It 's just the way people used to pose for photographs . Now the man tells you to smile  --  in those days he must have said , Look serious . ' That was the fashion . Did Gladstone ever grin ? Was Queen Victoria ever amused ? . . . Well , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him he was once at the Sutherland estate at Dunrobin when the Queen was being shown over , and in one of the rooms they looked into  --  by mistake , I suppose  --  they found a very fat policeman in bed with his clothes on . . . . The Queen nearly collapsed with laughter . " " A friend of your father 's knew the Queen ? " " Oh , he did n't really know her  --  he was just there when ithappened . Fat people in bed can be funny . . . thin people , too . " " There 's a lot of fun in just being a person  --  anywhere . " " So that 's your view of life ? " " Do n't you like it ? " " My little one . . . my darling . . . you know . . . you ca n't possibly know . . . how much it makes me love you . " " Love is fun too . " " Nizhni Novgorod is fun . " " I 'm glad we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " I do n't think the people who live there call it that any more . I mean , in the real Nizhni Novgorod . They 've got some new name . I do n't know what . I only know the old name because I read about the fair in a book . They used to have a fair there . A big fair there . ... " " Darling , you 're so tired . I 'm glad we came . Fancy , we both keep saying the same things again and again . " " Yes , fancy . . . . I had an aunt who said fancy ' to everything . Fancy ' or Just fancy ' or Fancy that . ' Fancy this . Just fancy us being here . .. . Later he said : " I 've done rather badly in th.aa ex'i min ' . tion .

I could n't even finish one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle  --  the heat it was  --  I ca n't think why they chose a hall that had such poor ventilation . . . .

So there you are  --  cards all on the table . " " I ought n't to have taken up so much of your time . " " Oh no . Never think that . I could n't have worked much harder than I did , anyhow . " " You could have rested instead of making all those trips to London . " " No , I should n't have rested  --  I should have tried to put in extra work and then broken down completely . Maybe you saved my life . . . . Lily , I 'm not like Peters . I ca n't take things in my stride . I 'm not first-rate in his way , or the way my brother Lindsay was . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real failure now , at the beginning  --  then I 'm definitely out of the race that I know I ca n't win . I 'm not disappointed . My father may be , but not me . Or else he 'll be disgusted . . . or perhaps in a queer sort of way glad that I 've come such a cropper . " " Glad , Charlie ? I do n't understand that . " " Never mind . . . . " " But how . . . how . . . could he . . . ? " " Darling , all I mean is that this thing is n't a tragedy . I was never terribly keen on the Diplomatic  --  from what I 've gathered it can be pretty dull and stuffy , and they send you to a lot of places you ca n't possibly enjoy . . . . It was just one way of getting started . " " Away from home ? " " Oh yes , of course . I could n't want to stay at Beeching . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 've never told me much about it . " " That 's not the reason . I did n't tell you much at first because I thought you 'd imagine me too far out of your world , and I did n't want to be . . and then I went on not telling you because I just had n't before . There 's nothing special about Beeching . MightTIME AND TIME AGAIN 101impress you till you tried it , then you 'd discover it had bad drains and no damp course and was n't really very comfortable to live in . " " But your home  --  that 's more than the house  --  that 's really what you want to get away from . " " How do you know ? . . . Well , in a way , you might be right . There are reasons I could n't go into  --  " " Charlie , can I ask one more question ? " " All right . " " What was your mother like ? " " We have a big portrait of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I do n't remember her . " " So you could n't love her . And you do n't love your father . " " Why do you say that ? . . . Well , I 'll admit I do n't love people as you do . You love everybody . Which really means anybody . . . . Oh no , that 's an unfair thing to say . I 'm sorry , Lily . All I mean is that it must make it hard for you to fall in love when you  --  " " I did with you  --  the first time we met . " " No , the second . The first time you did n't even look at me . That was when I did  --  while you were n't looking . I think we ought to get married quickly  --  before you look at somebody else . . . . Lily , I mean that . " " Do you ? " " Yes . . . . Oh God , yes . More than I 've ever meant any-thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charlie ? " " Do n't you want it ? " " Yes , if you do . . . and if Dad consents . I ca n't without that , because of my age . You ca n't either , till you 're twenty-one . " " I 'll be that in a month . We might live abroad . It 's cheap in France these days , on account of the exchange . And another thing  --  I could do some painting there . . . . Yes , even after a third . You never guessed I was serious about it , did you ? You thought it was just a hobby ? " " I thought it was a serious hobby  --  like Dad 's gardening . " 102 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 103 " Well , why not ? Oh Lily , we shall get along fine . The things I really want in life are simple if only I stick to them  --  and stick to wanting them . . . that 's the trouble , I 'm not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Bill Peters . . . . But a serious hobby I do have  --  thank you for that description , I love you for it . So it 's all settled  --  we 'll live in France and I 'll paint . How about it ? " She said thoughtfully : " Mr. Graybar does a lot of business with French exporters  --  I know their names and addresses  --  I 've typed hundreds of letters to them  --  " He was thinking how delightfully irrelevant this was till she added : " I 'm sure I could find a job with one of them . " Shock and amazement were then added , so that he gasped out : " Good God , you did n't suppose that was in my mind , did you ? " " But you might n't earn enough at first , Charlie . Not everybody buys paintings . " He did n't know then whether to laugh or cry  --  the intensely practical naivete of it reminded him of plunging into an ice-cold crystal stream in the sunshine . " Look , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question of you having to find a job , whether my paintings sell or not . As soon as I 'm twenty-one I come into some money from my mother 's estate  --  not much , but enough to live on in France . . . . About three hundred a year . . . . " " Three hundred pounds a year without working at all ? " It occurred to him that he had never heard the central issue of modern economics stated so eloquently as by her own incredulity . It made him feel he had something to brazen out . " Well , yes . . . so you see how it is  --  I can afford my serious hobby  --  and you . " He began to laugh . " I 'm laughing at myself for ever having worried about the future . Are n't you looking forward to it , Lily ? There are beautiful places in France  --  " " And I could come home sometimes , could n't I ? " " Home ? " " To Linstead . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , as often as you want . France is n't the South Sea Islands . " " That would be fun too . Like that French painter who went there and lived with a native girl . " " What ? " He was amazed again . " You mean Gauguin ? I did n't know you knew anything about painters ... . " " I read a book about him once . I do read , Charlie  --  you ought to know that  --  I was reading when you first saw me . I 'm not really so silly  --  " He found this utterly adorable . It was , he supposed , the effect of Cambridge  --  of seeing colleges and libraries , of meeting Weigall and Peters , who had also found her adorable . The whole idea of marrying her and going to France to paint gained on him so fast that he felt an intoxication in being alive ; the darkness of the little room glowed into deep colors , the touch of her body next to him was an easing of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had another quality the word for which had been pale in his mind for years  --  ever since he had first heard it in church as a child ; but now it sprang to warmth and meaning . Loving-kindness . She was loving-kind . They talked over all the details of the future till dawn showed at the sides of the window curtains . Now and then , in the distance , a lion roared . A few hours later they began to journey to London , having slept till it was too late for breakfast . As they approached the inner suburbs the sky darkened and rain began , so that the final miles of tram-lined roads were slow and slippery . Charles had hoped to keep his word by delivering her at Kingsway in time for the normal office opening , but he was nearly an hour late . She said it did n't matter  --  and it would have been absurd , of course , if it had . When he stopped the car at the curb and before he could get out , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing doors with an alacrity that seemed more absent-minded than apprehensive . He had a cup of tea at a cafe in Holborn , then drove back to Cambridge with the windshield wipers marking slow time104 TIME AND TIME AGAIN to his thoughts . It was two o'clock when he reached his rooms . He lay on the couch while Debden prepared a late lunch , but fell asleep and Debden did not wake him . He slept all afternoon and most of the evening and night . He had no more engagements ; it was merely a matter of putting in days at the college till term was over and he could leave Cambridge for good . This was hard to realize  --  that it was his last term and his university career would soon be ended . He had no particular plans for a vacation and was in no present mood to think of any . Presumably he would go to Beeching , at any rate for a while , and he had arranged to meet Lily on his way there across London . That would be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back on that curious interval it seemed to him that most of the hours had been of sleep . For the first time in weeks the clock chimes did not trouble him , and he would often doze on the couch and wake to find Debden offer- ing some odd-looking meal on a tray . Debden was an understand- ing fellow and had seen many a reading gentleman overwork himself for an examination and then half collapse in this fashion . " Sleep 's the thing , sir . Ca n't do you any ' arm no matter ' ow much of it you get  --  and that 's more than you can say of most things in life . . . . There was a man I ' ad ' ere once who did n't sleep a wink for weeks . .. . " This , thought Charles , was an unlikely story , but he listened quite contentedly to many such excerpts from the lifelong saga . On Friday morning Charles went to early chapel . He was not a regular attender , but at the beginnings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this morning , the last one of all , seemed an extra-special occasion . He remembered how emotional he had felt about Cambridge during his first term and that last year of the war , but of course the atmosphere then had been charged with the mystique of youth facing death . Three years later , amidst dubious peace and economic depression , the mood was far different , and Charles , at almost twenty-one , was different with it . He would have liked to let that final chapel service soak into him sentimentally , but he could n't relax enough ; the thoughtTIME AND TIME AGAIN 105of meeting Lily for lunch in London made him look at his watch too often . Crossing the quadrangle afterward he met Debden outside his staircase . He had tipped him well , and the man 's mood was confidential and extracurricular , as if Charles had already passed into the saga . " Gentleman to see you , sir . Would n't give ' is name , but said ' e 'd wait . He was the kind I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your rooms . " He had never seen Havelock looking so well since the days before Lindsay 's death ; that was a first impression . It was not merely that he was in one of the vaulting moods  --  there was a hint of something else that must have happened to generate such an air of authority . Charles fancied he was seeing his father as had many a judge and jury during those early years of triumph , and the spectacle was notable  --  even in some ways intimidating . " Well . . . . This is a surprise , Father ! " " Yes , I 'm sure it is . How are you , Charles ? I 'm glad I 've caught you before you took the train , because I have the car here . I thought we 'd travel back together . Nice day for a drive across country . Farrow 's with me . " Farrow was the chauffeur , which meant that the car would be the big Daimler , which Charles never liked as much as the small open car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the larger and darker one was that his father 's unexpected visit meant canceling the arrangement to meet Lily in London . There was no alternative , though of course he could make a special trip to see her some other day , and soon . The disappointment hit him all the more acutely because their last meeting had left , as it was bound to , so many afterthoughts and afteremotions . He said , seeking to disguise how he felt : " That would be nice . . . . Have you had breakfast ? Debden will get you some coffee . . and , in the meantime , I must send a wire . " " A wire ? " 106 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 107 " Just to cancel an engagement . I 'd planned to meet someone in London , but now that I ca n't manage it I must let them know . " " I see . " And then , when Charles had reached the door : " Is it , by any chance , a girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  what then ? " " If the girl 's name is Lily Mansfield you need n't send it . " Charles recrossed the room , the warmth in his face draining to pallor as he approached his father . " What makes you say that ? " " She 's not there  --  to receive it . " " Not where ? " " Anywhere you would have sent it . " Havelock 's eyes were shining . " Now sit down . I 've something to tell you . . . . And no coffee  --  Close your outer door  --  sport your oak  --  do they still use that phrase ? . . . We do n't want to be interrupted . " Charles was now possessed by a single fear . " Father , what 's happened ? For God 's sake do n't make a drama of it . Is she all right ? Is she well ? Has anything  --  ? " " She 's perfectly well  --  I did n't mean to alarm you . Now will you close that door ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coincidence . Reg Robinson , it seemed , had been motorcycling on the previous Sunday evening and had found himself thirsty just outside the Swan in the little market town . From the saloon bar he could see into the dining room where Lily and Charles were at one of the tables . Quelling an impulse to intrude , he had decided more shrewdly to watch and wait ; presently he had seen them walk down the lane to a cottage . The possible significance of this grew on him slowly , but was soon ( Havelock suggested ) reinforcedby personal jealousy and a strong surge of class-conscious virtue . He had made a few inquiries , taken down names and details , and then jumped on his motorcycle with the news . It was the following evening , however , before he passed it on . " An interestingdelay , " Havelock commented . " Did he want time tothink things over ? Or was he enjoying a sense of power ? He could have called before Mansfield went to work in the morning  --  but no , he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talking to the girl beforehand , which he did  --  lIe telephoned her at her office during the day  --  just an innocent chat between friends , no disclosures on either side , yet both with a secret that must have been infinitely preoccupying . He asked her , perhaps , if she had had a pleasant week end , and one may imagine her answer  --  casual enough , yet bringing a flush to her cheeks that no one observed . ... " Havelock was soaring into an empyrean of his own , so far unclouded by blame or moral censure . The voice , lyric in quality , flowed on effortlessly from sentence to sentence , developing a theme , building to some sort of climax . " The temptations of youth , Charles , are not beyond comprehension to any man of mature age who remembers his own . I do n't know what kind of youth you think I had myself , but I assure you it was far from flawless , far from the patterns of pulpit and schoolroom . . . . But by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still that he did not know . he interrupted : " Suppose we do n't go into all that now , Father . Just tell me a few more facts . . . . Do you mind ? " " Of course not . Talk it over as much as you like . The whole matter 's cleared up  --  there 's no urgency . I 'm telling you that in advance , because I do n't want to scare you again . I 'm sorry that at the outset you misunderstood me  --  it was my own fault for a somewhat clumsy opening  --  " " Please , Father  --  just the facts . Tell me  --  " " You 've had them all  --  all that are important . Your little escapade  --  as I said  --  was discovered and reported , and I 'm bound to say it was sheer bad luck  --  this fellow cruising about on his motorcycle  --  " " But what do you mean by saying it 's all cleared up ? " Then a curious transformation came over Havelock 's face . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and bland to rough and tough . It occurred to Charles , still under108 TIME AND TIME AGAIN the influence of his first impression , that this was the sort of thing that must have happened when his father had cross-ex- amined witnesses  --  first the sweet mellifluous questions , the art- less probings , the seeming sympathy , the words , words , words to soften and disarm ; then , all at once , the rapier thrust . " Just this , " Havelock snapped . " You were in a damned mess and I 've got you out of it . This girl and her parents could have ruined your life . They had you in their power . I 'm not exaggerat- ing . It would have been easier to handle them if they 'd been blackmailers , or if the girl had been some cheap little tart . But they 're decent people . Keep away from decent people when you 're in the mood for mischief of this kind . That 's sound advice from a lawyer . I 've known cases like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor from home for an immoral pur- pose  --  Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885  --  abduction  --  how do you like the sound of it ? But that 's what I could con- vict you of , you fool , if I were prosecuting and you were in the dock ! " Charles did n't like the sound of it at all . He was sheerly ap palled and there was n't a word he could reply . He felt he had heard a story about someone else whose behavior could n't be likened to any that had ever been his own . Then Havelock 's face relaxed somewhat . Beguilement began again , the sentences became less staccato , even the words seemed drawn from a different vocabulary . " As I said , the Mansfields are decent people . That , at the outset , was an obstacle . But in the end  --  and due largely , if you must know the truth , to a certain skill I have always had in presenting a point of view  --  they agreed to behave magnanimously . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And  --  incidentally  --  the girl is n't preg- nant . " All Charles could then say was a muttered , " Oh God "  --  which he was glad his father did not hear because it represented a per- sonal emotion which he did not want to explain or even to analyze . He then went to the window and stared out ; men were still loitering in the court on their way from chapel . What a won- derful last morning of one 's college career ! he thought bitterly . IIe swung round and broke the silence that his father had made intolerable by his merely watching presence . " Where is she ? Where is she now ? " " They 've sent her to stay with some relatives in the country . " " I must see her . " " I do n't think you can . " " But . . . dammit . . . as you yourself said , she 's not a cheap little tart . I 'd have married her . . . . I want to marry her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you feel the Mansfields ought to jump at such a thing , but believe me , they do n't . It speaks well for them , Charles . Many a respectable family would have regarded that as quite legitimate blackmail . " " I 'm not concerned with what they regard . It 's what I want  --  and what Lily wants . " " What a girl of seventeen wants is n't  --  " " Seventeen ? " " Oh ? Did n't she tell you that ? " Charles replied absently , as if the matter were already unimportant : " She said eighteen . " " In court I should point out that we have only your word for that . But of course I believe you , and I 've no doubt the girl herself would confirm the deception . " " Good God , it is n't much of a deception . It 's nothing . A year . " Havelock laughed in a way which , Charles reflected , would give a fine impression beyond the double doors that the two of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I find that funny , Charles ? Because you said a year is nothing . A year is just about what I could have got you off with ! " So it was funny , maybe . But hardly jolly . Charles felt ill , and of all things in the world the one he least desired was to travel in a car with his father across several counties and finally arrive at Beeching . Yet that , quite clearly , was all he could do . So he110 TIME AND TIME AGAINwent to his bedroom and began packing the last few things in a suitcase . They did n't talk much during the journey , but Havelock remained in excellent humor . Not only must there be pleasure in having saved a son from ruin , but fatherly intervention had awakened old techniques , had unsheathed rusty swords from mildewed scabbards . They stopped for lunch at Banbury , and Havelock then mentioned Charles 's approaching twenty-first birthday . He could not have chosen a worse time for evoking any warm response , and this may have been why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big party for tenants that landownerstraditionally gave when their sons came of age . Havelockhad done this for Lindsay , but now it was clear he did n't want to do it for Charles . Charles did n't mind a bit ( he would have found such festivities irksome at the best of times ) , but he could only marvel at his father 's astuteness in breaking the news just then . He said : " Really , Father , it suits me not to have the thing . So far as I 'm concerned everybody can forget the birth-day . " " Oh dear no , not at all . I had thought of a jaunt to town , perhaps  --  just the two of us . We never have had that , have we ? Dinner at my club and then perhaps a theater . " " Oh , let 's decide later . " " I thought I 'd mention it , though , to stake out my claim before you plan anything else . " " I 'm not planning . I ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Everything seems uncertain . How can it be otherwisejust now ? " " You mean that your future depends a great deal on the results of the Tripos Examination ? " " God , no , I was n't even thinking of that  --  but of course it 's true . And I may as well tell you , I have n't done well . In fact I 've done damn badly . Maybe I have n't even passed  --  and I don'tcare . I want some happiness in life . I do n't see why it all has to be broken . I do n't see  --  I ca n't  --  I  --  " He became speechless and incoherent , breaking down a little , and his father summoned an old and rather decrepit waiter who presided over the hotel dining room . " My son is ill , " he said . " Would you kindly help me to take him to my car ? " Charles soon pulled himself together at that . " I do n't need any help , " he said roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there 's nothingthe matter with me . " But the old waiter had taken his arm by that time and Charles did not want to push him aside and perhaps off his feet , so before he properly knew what was happeninghe was taking part in a spectacle that moved slowly through the dining room and across the hotel lobby and down the steps to the car , in front of the curious stares of a score or more onlookers . Probably they thought he was drunk . He reflected afterward that his father must have staged it suddenly and for a mere whim before such an utterly random audience , since nobody in Banbury knew them and they were unlikely to stop there again . Charles was ill at Beeching for several weeks , of no ailment that the local doctor could diagnose , and with no particular symptomsexcept a high temperature . But it was easy for Dr. Somervilleto ascribe the trouble to recent overstudy , and to recommendrest and a holiday as the only but a very certain cure . Havelock was sympathetic and talked of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer . Or perhaps he would rather stay at Beeching and do nothing except paint whenever he had the mood . But to Charles the thought of painting was a signal for despair , and the first day he got up after being in bed he collected all his paraphernalia  --  easel , brushes , paints , and finished canvases  --  and packed them in an old trunk in the loft over the stables . Only one positive decision had emerged from the confusion of notions and emotions that had sent his temperature to fever112 TIME AND TIME AGAINheight , and that was to visit Ladysmith Road . He had sent sev- eral letters there , addressed to Lily , and had not been surprised when they were unanswered . He knew that a personal visit might be just as fruitless , the Mansfields might refuse to admit him or discuss anything , there might be an unpleasant scene , they might even call the police ( though knowing their respectabilities he did not really think there was much risk of this ) ; but what- ever happened or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least removed from the sphere of total doubt . One of these questions was how far , if at all , his father 's story was untrue or exaggerated . He did not expect to find much dis- crepancy ; nevertheless the visit to Ladysmith Road became some- how obligatory in his mind , a scene a faire that had to be acted out . One day he went up to London without telling his father , leav- ing merely a message with Cobb that he might be back late that evening or the next day . On arrival at Paddington he made a routine test by telephoning the Kingsway office ; a girl 's voice answered that Miss Mansfield was no longer working there . This again was no astonishment . He next called in person and asked to see somebody named Ethel . Ethel , it seemed , had gone to lunch at the Lyons teashop near the British Museum , where he had first set eyes on Lily . He was told to ask the girl at the cashier 's desk to point out Ethel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have found devious and embarrassing , he went through in somber misery that was aware of nothing but itself . Ethel was hostile ; she would tell him nothing ( perhaps she did not know much ) , but it was clear she held him responsible for at least the interruption of a friendship . After a few moments Charles left her and wandered vaguely through the streets till he found himself in Lincoln 's Inn Fields . He sat down on a bench and tried to think of a way to get the afternoon over . He did not think he could concentrate on a film , still less on a revisiting of any of the places he had been to with Lily ( and these had in- cluded practically everything in the guidebook ) ; so he took an early train to Linstead and spent the intervening hours in thatTIME AND TIME AGAIN 113suburb . He knew it was no use calling on Mr. Mansfield before seven , by which time he would have finished his evening meal . Oddly perhaps , Charles had seen little of Linstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ladysmith Road , less than half a mile and by an unchanging route , they had never made it a background of adventure or experience ; they had always been hurrying somewhere else or home again afterward . Yet Charles knew that Lily liked the place , and had shown pride in it on that first occasion he had gone there with her ; but , as was her nature , she had let the matter drop when she found in him no special response . So now he walked about Linstead streets , as if by so doing he could commune with something that had shared with him Lily 's affections . It did not work out very well . He still found Linstead dull and featureless , its long roads of bay-windowed houses infinitely depressing . And yet , he realized , there were streets of Regency houses in the better parts of Londonalmost as long and as uniform , and those houses too had been put up by speculative builders at a time of boom and with no aim but profit . So where , then , lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplorable than the other ? The answer , Which was only the beginning of other questions , gave his mind a focus for a while ; but soon he was in dim perspectives again , wondering if and how he could trace a thin line of happiness for himself on the blind face of the future . Toward evening he entered a restaurant in the High Road near the station . He was n't hungry but he wanted a cup of coffee . A first-floor windowoffered a view of trains that arrived every few minutes from London ; he saw the countless doors open before the trains came to a halt and the crowd spill out like burst liquid , then shape into a stream , thickening and congesting as it reached the station exit ; but once beyond this bottleneck the mass suddenly unliquefied  --  human beings with separate aims dispersing in every direction . Charles watched till after six ; then he picked up his bill and left . On the way out to the cash desk he passed a big mirror and saw himself , like any other fellow walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for change ; he114 TIME AND TIME AGAINwondered what he would think of himself as a stranger met thus for the first time . Medium height , brown hair and eyes , no distinguishingmarks  --  the passport specifications came easily . Or would it be no marks of distinction ? Just a tired look and a worried face . But not even that ; he did not think the stranger in the mirror looked more than averagely bothered about anything . A man he passed in the street outside had an air of far greater harassment , and Charles watched him for a few seconds , saw him buy an evening paper and turn to the stop-press column that gave the racing results . Charles smiled to himself ; the incident was calming . People , it would seem , were apt to be neither as happy nor as unhappy as they looked ; and he was one of them . The anonymity of being anybody nudged his mind with the first touch of philosophic comfort he had been able to muster . The world 's end was a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking this , there came to him an echo from a forgotten source  --  something he had read somewhere , he wished he could remember where  --  " It is not many miles to Mantua , no further than the end of this mad world . " He reached Number 214 about a quarter past seven and rang the doorbell . He was not very nervous . The afternoon in Linstead , walking about and thinking things over , had been helpful . He saw the familiar lace curtains in the bay window and noticed the center one draped to enshroud a plant that was new there  --  an exotic fleshy-leaved thing , bigger than the much derided aspidistra . Probably Mr. Mansfield 's latest pride . Somehow this evidence , if it were such , that Mr. Mansfield was still functioning in his beloved world of horticulture gave Charles another nudge of comfort . A nice job , being a parkkeeper  --  and if one wanted to make a play on words rather than realities , what had generations of Andersons been if not parkkeepers , since Beeching was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Havelock and Mr. Mansfield in a park together . But it was thus with so many words  --  love , for instance , a perfect catchall of meaning , since one could use it about anything from God to goulash ; and yet so clinchingly compared with like , because oneTIME AND TIME AGAIN 115never spoke of " falling in liking " with anybody , and also because one often said one " rather liked " somebody , whereas nobody ever " rather loved . " For instance , he rather liked Mr. Mansfield . ... And so his thoughts rambled on till he heard footsteps approaching along the hall . He knew then he was in luck  --  not only because someone was at home , but the footsteps were surely those of the one he rather liked . The door opened . Yes , indeed . Mr. Mansfield was in gardening boots and an old jacket , and carried a large earthenware flowerpot which he had apparently been too absent-minded to set down anywhere . Naturally he was more taken aback than Charles , though the latter had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowerpot . It shattered on the floor of the lobby . Charles had prefigured just about every possibility but this . He crossed the threshold without invitation and stooped to gather the fragments into a heap . " Butterfingers ! " exclaimed Mr. Mansfield , gasping a word that Charles had never expected to be the first one spoken between them . " But you give me a turn , Charlie , that 's wot you did  --  you really give me a turn . You was the larst person I 'd ' ave thought  --  " " I 'm terribly sorry , " Charles interrupted . " Perhaps I should have let you know , but  --  here , let me tidy this up . " " No , it 's all right . " Mr. Mansfield was fast recovering , and with recovery came a mounting resentment . " Look ' ere now , I du n no wot you 've come for  --  Lily ai n't ' ere now , your dad must ' ave told you that . I really du n no wot you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I ai n't goin ' to ' ave no trouble . See ? " But having delivered that , his protest and his credo , he was clearly at a loss to continue . He let Charles open the door of the parlor and followed him meekly inside . Then with his own big hands , but carefully wiping the garden dirt off them before he touched the knob , he closed the door . He looked incongruous with his old clothes and gardening boots in this small spotless room packed with furniture and ornaments . But at least , Charles reflected , he seemed already to have exhausted his anger. 116 TIME AND TIME AGAINCharles said , breathlessly improvising : " Mr. Mansfield , I 've not come here to make trouble at all . I do n't want it any more than you do . My father , as you say , told me more or less what happened , but I felt I had to see you for confirmation before I could take all of it in . .. . " " It ai n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ai n't ' ere and you ai n't goin ' to see ' er . I give my word and I mean it . " " You mean you give me your word now or you gave it to my father ? " " I give my word , that 's all . I just give my word . " And then abruptly : " I believe that front door 's left open . Mind if I see ? " And so it was , the front door left wide open , as people never left their front doors open in Ladysmith Road ; amidst the excitement of their meeting and the smashed flowerpot neither of them had thought to close it . Mr. Mansfield went out to the lobby and did so , while Charles was aware of a quality he knew and loved in Lily , a gentleness , a humility , an alrnost foolish sweetnessthat would make Mr. Mansfield ask an unwelcome visitor if he might close the door of his own house . When Mr. Mansfield returned to the parlor Charles abandoned all his mentally rehearsed speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we go any further . I love Lily and I want to marry her . And if I 'd known there 'd be all this upset I 'd never have  --  " But then he stopped . What would he never have done ? Did he mean merely that had he known Reg Robinson would be motorcycling anywhere near the Swan , he would have found another town and another hotel ? This , even if true , was hardly worth saying ; but was it the whole truth anyhow ? Could there not be regrets that did not imply apology or confession  --  regrets for the grinding of memory into the sawdust of shabby outcome ? But Charles could not hope to explain this question , still less expectan answer ; and therefore he did not know how to finish his sentence . He broke off simply , without floundering , content with the silence that followed . Then , as if it had been the most natural inquiry of a friend , he said : " She 's all right , I suppose ? " Mr. Mansfield replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGAIN 117do so . " She 's with the wife in the country . I give my word I would n't say where , but it 's a nice place . She 'll stay there awhile . She ai n't come to no ' arm , in a manner of speakin ' . Oh , she 's all right  --  right as rain  --  she 's at the ' ouse of the wife 's sister and ' er ' usband . ' Er ' olidays was due , anyway . Bert and Maud are on their ' olidays too . " " Leaving you all by yourself ? " Mr. Mansfield nodded , a crease of humor rounding the edge of his nostrils . " To tell the truth I ai n't sorry . Gives me a chance to do a bit extra in the garden . " " I was admiring this plant as I came in . New , is n't it ? " " Ficus elastica . From Brazil . Fancy you noticin ' it . Grows out-of-doors as a rule , but I brought it ' ome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Bin a good year for most things . I got a fine show of roses out in the back . " He paused , as if meditating an invitation and then thinking better of it . " I was just goin ' out to water ' em when you come . " " I 'm interrupting you , I 'm afraid . " " Oh , they can wait . Matter of fact , if you do n't mind , I 'll take off these old boots . Du n no wot the wife would say if she saw me in ' ere with ' ern on . . . . Be back in a minute . " Mr. Mansfield then went out and Charles heard him climb the stairs to the floor above  --  the room above also , for after a few seconds the ceiling shook to heavy footfalls and some glass beads in the lampshade began to tinkle . Charles had nothing to do but look about him , remembering the only time he had been in the room before and Reg 's terrific handshake received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls ; there was an old-fashioned overmantel above the fireplace , and a center table covered what would otherwise have been the only completelyvisible square yard of carpet . Pride of place was given to a modern radio-gramophone of exactly the same model as the one at Beeching . Sir Havelock had not been keen enough on music to equip his house with anything de luxe ; whereas the Mansfields must have made sacrifices to buy such a relatively expensive machine . So the two families could meet , as it were , on the social118 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 119level of mass-produced entertainment . And for that matter , Charles reflected , if one were to go round with the eye of an artist there was just as much junk in the Beeching drawing room . Presently footsteps descended the stairs and Mr. Mansfield re- entered . He had changed not only his boots but his clothes , and Charles thought he must also have brushed his hair and given himself a general spruce-up . " Well , I was n't long , was I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it seems to me  --  if you ai n't in a ' urry . . . always quiet there this time of an evenin ' . . . . ' " Why yes , " said Charles . " A good idea . " They talked mostly about gardening as they walked the short distance to the Prince Rupert , and Charles did not press the con- versation to any more serious issue . He could bide his time , and he judged that after a drink or so Mr. Mansfield might be more communicative . Charles had learned very little so far , ex- cept that Lily 's father had given a promise to his ; he felt he must know more about this , where and how it had happened ; it was the atmosphere he wanted to explore almost more than the territory . Then , during that first moment at the bar of the Prince Rupert , something happened that told him so much of everything that all else was merely a filling in of detail . Charles had been the first to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mansfield had replied : " Bitter for me , Charlie . " There was nobody else in the bar , not even the barmaid ; soon , however , a buxom woman who was evidently the landlady came up and greeted Mr. Mansfield as an old and favorite customer . " Two bitters , " said Charles , but before she could serve them Mr. Mansfield cleared his throat to proclaim with great solemnity : " Mrs. Webber , I want you to meet Mr. Anderson . " Mrs. Webber smiled and Charles shook hands with her across the counter . She had the air of being a great lady . Mr. Mansfield continued : " This Mr. Anderson 's the sonof Sir ' Avelock Anderson who was with me ' ere the other evenin '  --  you remember Sir ' Avelock , Mrs. Webber ? " " My goodness , I should say I do ! We were so glad to meet Sir Havelock . " And then to Charles : " What a wonderful man your father is ! The stories he told ! I really do believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansfield ? " Charles could believe it also . Over their drinks Mr. Mansfield was not in the least unwilling to talk of an event that had evidentlyadded so much to his local prestige . Havelock , it seemed , had in the first place received a letter from Mr. Mansfield . " Mind you , it was Reg that wrote it  --  Reg said your dad ought to know . And then your dad came to see us as soon as ' e got the letter . We was ' avin ' supper but ' e 'd ' ad ' is so the wife made ' im a cup of tea and we all talked it over . " " All ? " " Well , not Bert and Maud  --  they was away on their ' olidays , like I said . But Reg was there . " " And Lily ? " " She come in during the middle of it . She 'd just bin round the corner to get some needles . " " Some what ? " " Needles . For the gramophone . Reg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all goin ' to ' ear ' em after supper . " Mr. Mansfieldtook in Charles 's glance and slowly interpreted it . " Oh , we was all on good terms by then  --  we 'd ' ad it out with ' er . No good ' angin ' on to trouble , I always says , or it 'll ' ang on to you . .. . Besides , we could n't blame it all on the girl . She did n't orter ' ave done what she did , but ' oos fault was it really ? " Charles shook his head , not in either reluctance or inability to answer the question , but because his mind was boggling at the picture of his father sitting at the table in the living room at Ladysmith Road , drinking a cup of tea and " talking it over " with the Mansfields and Reg , then Lily entering the domestic circle with a supply of gramophone needles . . . . Mr. Mansfield took advantage of the silence to catch Mrs. Webber 's eye and signal for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGAIN " I 'll tell you , Charlie  --  and once said we wo n't say no more  --  it was your fault , because you was n't a gentleman . I thought you was , and I was wrong . I did n't know ' oo you was , mind you , but I did think you was a gentleman . That time after we first met in the street I said to Lily when she got ' ome . . . Lily , I said , ' e 's a gentleman . Because I did think you was . " Charles could only pick up a single point of this indictment . He said weakly : " I do n't quite know what you mean when you say you did n't know who I was . . . . Lily introduced us . " " Wot I mean is , you never told Lily about your dad bein ' a Sir . It was Reg found that out . You never told nobody . " Charles agreed that he had n't . " I did n't think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound boastful . Anyhow , to get back to what happened , my father came to see you and had a talk with you all , and then . . . then what ? " " That 's all . We just talked and I brought ' im ' ere and ' im and me ' ad another talk , man to man . A real gentleman , your dad is , that I will say . " " What did Lily think of him ? " " She liked ' im . Who could ' elp it ? Of course ' e was upset , but then afterward ' e got friendly same as if ' e 'd known us all for years . " " He was upset ? " " An ' why should n't ' e be ? ' E ' ad n't bin told any more than we ' ad . ' E did n't even know you knew Lily . It was a shock to ' im , the way it would be to any father . ' E ' as ' is ' opes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' e thought you was studyin ' at college you was carryin ' on with a gel ' e never knew about . Natch- rally ' e was upset . . . . Mind you , that was at first , at the ' ouse . Afterward when ' im and me came ' ere we ' ad quite a lively time , like Mrs. Webber was sayin ' . " " Tell me  --  tell me just this  --  did you ever , during the talk you had  --  threaten  --  or say anything to him  --  about bringing a charge against me ? " " A charge ? " Mr. Mansfield 's stare was so bewildered that Charles knew it was the completest possible answer in itself . But he felt driven to continue : " A charge in a police court  --  a charge of . . . " But he somehow could not bring himself to speak the word " abduction . " " Gawd , no , I never said nothin ' about that , " Mr. Mansfield answered glumly , as if it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles was devoutly glad that an interruptionenabled them both to drop the matter at exactly that moment . For the door of the bar had opened and a voice was shouting : " Wotcher , Freddy  --  and ' ow 's Freddy ? " Mr. Mansfield swung around , happily diverted . " Well , if it ai n't old ' Arry ! . . . ' Arry , this is Mr. Anderson  --  you remember Sir ' Avelock Anderson ' oo I came ' ere with the other night ? This is Sir ' Avelock 's son . . . . Charlie . . . . Mr. Byfield . " Harry Byfield , an excited little tub of a man with waxed mustaches , gripped Charles 's hand and held it while he bestowed a beam of overacted recognition . " My goodness , and do n't ' e look like ' is dad too ! Same eyes , same nose . . . . Charlie , what 're you ' avin ? . . . Three bitters , Mrs. Webber , and ' ow 's Mrs. Webber ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father at all , found this rather disconcerting . But it was a sample of what went on all the evening , with customer after customer . What an audience his father must have had , he reflected , and after so many bitters and in spite of his own personal troubles , he could not help feeling slightly amused . The bar filled up as the evening progressed , and the very crowding of it enabled Charles occasionally to get Mr. Mansfieldalone . Then he put questions that seemed all the more urgent because he had either to shout them at normal speaking range or else whisper them loudly in Mr. Mansfield 's ear . Wheneverpossible he did the latter . Nobody was listening or trying to , and there could not perhaps have been any place safer for the discussion of utterly private matters. 122 TIME AND TIME AGAIN " Tell me about Lily , " he kept saying more insistently as the drinks affected him . " Tell me about her . You say she 's all right - but is she happy ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She ai n't wot you might call an un'appy gel by nature . She was upset , like we all was , but you do n't ' ave to worry . She 'll get over it . " Charles was more worried that she might than that she might n't . And then , through the undulating lens of alcohol , he saw Lily as incomparably fair and lovely , beckoning to him from some distant land where she would be happy anyway , with him if he joined her or without him if he did n't . Yes , he knew Lily . She liked people . She loved people . She loved everybody . She loved her father and mother and Bert and Evelyn and Maud . She loved Reg . She loved Mr. Graybar and Ethel and the busker outside the theater who had stuck his collecting bag through the taxi window . She loved Weigall and Peters . She even loved his father . It was easy for her to do all she could to please all these people because she loved them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to do anything she could to please him , Charles . Why , she even loved places , too . She loved Lin- stead . She loved Cambridge . And she would doubtless love that nice place in the country whose whereabouts Mr. Mansfield would not disclose . " But surely we can write to each other , " Charles pleaded . " If I send a letter wo n't you forward it ? " " I give my word I would n't , Charlie . " " But what if she writes to me ? Ca n't I answer ? You ca n't stop her from writing . " " Well now , Charlie , we was all ' opin ' you 'd understand . " " I 'm damned if I do . I do n't think you do either . Because  --  do n't you realize  --  I want to marry her . I asked her and she said she would if you consented . I 'm twenty-one next month , so I do n't need my father 's consent after that . " Mr. Mansfield stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd and clapped him violently on the shoulder . There followed the inevitable greetings and introductions and respectful references to Sir ' Avelock and another round of bitters ; it was half an hour before Charles had a chance to repeat what he had said , though somewhat less coherently . So Mr. Mansfield stroked his chin again . " Charlie , wot you say does you credit . Maybe you was n't a gentleman that once , but you tike after your dad , like ' Arry Byfield said , and your dad 's a gentleman if ever there was one . That 's why I give ' im my word . It 's right wot ' e said , too . Lily 's a nice gel , as nice a gel as a father could wish to ' ave , but she would n't be a ' elp to you , Charlie , not in your kind of life . Man to man , and speakin ' as men of the world , your dad and I agreed about that . Not that I ai n't just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great granddad was in the Battle of Waterloo  --  we got a ' istory too , the Mansfields ' ave . Only , as your dad said , with all your ejucationand the position you 'll ' ave later on  --  " " Oh , for God 's sake , " Charles interrupted , " will you let me tell you the plain truth ? I 'm not going to have the kind of future my father 's planning for me . I 've done so badly in my examinationsI could n't have it even if I wanted it . " " That 's wot Lily said , and it upset ' er , thinkin ' she was part responsible . " " Let me finish . There 's no reason for anybody to be upset . When I 'm twenty-one I shall have enough money and I 'm going to live abroad and if Lily will marry me we can both be happy . Now then , will you consent ? " " Charlie , it ai n't a bit o ' good you carryin ' on about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ' eadstrong , that 's wot 's the matter with you . But I tike back wot I said when I said you was n't a gentleman . . . . " Mr. Mansfield also was beginning to feel the effects of six or seven bitters . It was almost ten o'clock ; the barman was already blinking lights and calling for the last reorders ; Mrs. Webber and Milly were rolling up their sleeves for a final crescendo of service . " Gawlummy , look at the time ! Charlie , boy  --  one more , just to show there 's no ill feelin ' . And124 TIME AND TIME AGAINcall me Fred . . . . Easy now , mind them glarsses . . . . Goo ' night , ' Arry . . . . Goo ' night , Mr. Wilkinson . . . Two more please , Mrs. Webber , when you 've a minute . . . . But wot I was sayin ' , Charlie , you 're too ' eadstrong . She 's only a gel yet , but like I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an older feller , provided ' e 's a gentleman , and that 's wot I thought you was , Charlie . " Mr. Mansfield seemed to have some vague awareness that he had said that before and the memory troubled him in a wispy sort of way . His eyes were red and wet , but probably due to the smoke . The bitters came . Charles raised his glass and saw past the brown liquid to something on the opposite wall that brought him to a jerk of attention  --  the picture of a pretty girl holding up a glass of beer , just as he was , and the girl reminded him of Lily , and Lily reminded him of a word that Mr. Mansfield had just spoken about her . " Sixteen , " Charles muttered . " You said sixteen .... " " Sixteen then  --  when you was first seein ' ' er . . . . Goo ' night , Mr. Beale  --  remember me to Mrs. Beale . . . . Goo ' night , Scotty . . . . Seventeen now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never told me . " " You never told ' er things neither . But I tike back wot I said , remember that . " Mr. Mansfield raised his own glass and for the first time that evening offered a toast . " Well , Charlie . . . ' ere 's to us and our dear ones . . .. " eAtvCharlesdid not remember much of what happened during the next few hours . He had an impression that they left the Prince Rupert together , but their conversation , if any , did not stay in his mind . Later he woke up in darkness with a terrific headache and an enormous confrontation of difficulties  --  physical difficulty in finding a light switch and , when he had found one and pressed it , mental difficulty in recognizing the scene , and visual difficulty in facing any kind of illumination . At length he decided he had been asleep on the couch in the parlor at Lady-1 1 lvl t11N L 1 1 lvl 1 , 21 V 2111N ILUsmith Road . He was fully dressed except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling parched , he fumbled his way to the kitchen sink . Along the lobby he could hear loud snores from upstairs . He drank several glasses of water and returned to the parlor to put on his shoes , but this was too much of an undertaking , so he leaned back on the couch . Doubtless more time passed , because when he . looked again there was light beyond the Ficus elastica as well as dangling from the ceiling . He remembered then that Lily had said there were trains every hour throughout the night between Linstead and London . So it really did n't matter what time it was . This seemed an enormous boon as he laced his shoes and put on his coat . In the pocket he found a pencil and his Cambridge tailor 's bill that had arrived at Beeching the previous morning ; he had n't opened it , but he did so now , merely to use the envelope . On the back of this he wrote : Dear Mr. Mansfield , Thanks , I 'm all right . Best wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio-gramophone . As he went to the front door he could still hear snores from upstairs . They reminded him of something that sent him back to the parlor and the radio-gramophone . He crossed out " Mr. Mansfield " and wrote " Fred . " In the street the cool air , which he had hoped might be refreshing , merely invited a fuller onslaught of nausea . He had been drunk a few times before , but never like this . His last act in Ladysmith Road was to vomit , monumentally , into the gutter a few yards from the corner of the High Road . Then , with some relief , he was able to catch the 4:23 at Linstead Station . From Liverpool Street , where he felt worse again after the train journey , he took a taxi to an all-night Turkish bath in a street near the Haymarket . But even after every ministration it could offer , includinga long doze in the steam room , he still felt far from himself when he left it around noon . Or rather , he speculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt before had never been himself at all . A rather grim change , as if he had grown out of something , but not yet into something else. 126 TIME AND TIME AGAIN oDuring the next few days at Beeching Charles was able to confirm that the change existed , though less grimly and no longer by any possibility the result of a hangover . For the first time he found himself meeting his father on territory where boundaries were recognized . He made no disclosures of his recent trip to Linstead and Havelock put no questions . Charles walked about the Beeching gardens feeling somehow adult and hard-bitten , and in a perverse kind of way relishing it . He wrote , for instance , to Brunon , who had a teaching job at Clermont-Ferrand ; he asked what sort of place that was to live in . What he must wait for , of course , was his twenty-first birthday  --  the first step ; but he gave his father no inkling of any special urgency . That would be revealed on the day he was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his planning was sensational  --  merely to step down finally from the educational ladder , without trying for any higher rung , and live abroad on his private income . It might not be heroic  --  private incomes rarely were  --  but he had no wish to be heroic . As for Lily in his scheme of things , he was , he knew , handicapped by her age ; perhaps he would have to wait awhile , but surely not till she also was of age  --  that would be unthinkable . The whole matter was one he must explore , legally to begin with , then he would know where he stood . So far he had behaved like a youth ; from now on he must do things with a man 's determinationand responsibility . Havelock was immensely genial during this period . After dinner father and son would usually sit in the library drinking port for an hour or so  --  a pose of eighteenth-century comeliness that well matched the house . But each was secretly measuring the other and aware of a trigonometry of distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs in the law  --  he liked to recollect them and how he had outwitted this or that witness or an opposing counsel . Charles could picture his father wigged and gowned and pointing a playful finger over the courtroom  --  Prospero casting his spell till , suddenly , the maskTIME AND TIME AGAIN 127withdrawn , everything dissolved in Caliban fury . Charles had seen this happen in his dreams , but now , because he was no longer afraid , he did not banish it from his waking thoughts  --  he even welcomed it , with a slight burlesque of being impressed . He knew his father reveled in the high drama , but his own enjoymentwas to snap the tensions by some light remark that Havelock could not relish , though it was never anything to which he could object . " I 'll bet you put on a show , " was the sort of thing Charles would comment , in half-derisive admiration . For Havelock was still putting on a show . The darkest moment came when he asked why Charles did n't paint any more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles shrugged in answer , then said obscurely : " You 're the one to worry about verdicts , not me . " The truth was , he could n't endure just then even the thought of painting , much less a discussionof it with his father . It belonged somehow to the part of him that was hurt , the part that could not he bitten hard enough to become hard-bitten . Sometimes comedy came unsought as when , for instance , Charles asked if there had ever been any reply to that letter Havelock had written to The Times about the honorary degree . Havelock seemed to have to ransack his memory for any recollectionof the incident ( he always found it easy to forget the foolish things he had done ) , but at length he replied : " Oh yes , just one  --  but only from some crazy fellow . " Amiably he went to the bureau where he kept his papers and began a search . " Some parson  --  if I can find it . Addressed to me personally , of course  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Here it is . " Scribbled on embossed notepaper from a Yorkshire vicarage , it pointed out that the initial letters of " Sagacity , Willpower , Integrity , Nobility , Experience " ( which Havelock had offered as his own better translation of the Latin ) could well supply a motto for the entire Coalition administration in its choice of appointees to government positions  --  a choice naturally dictated by such a128 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 129leader as Lloyd George . The motto the parson suggested was : " Scottish , Welsh , Irish , Never English . " " Now who would have thought of that ? " Havelock mused . " Of course the fellow must be off his head . " Charles began to laugh , and soon was laughing almost hysterically . The whole incident seemed to find its perfect end in a joke that was all the better because his father did not see it . The twenty-first birthday fell on a Friday , so Charles and his father went to London that morning , having planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club and an evening at the London Pavilion , where there was a good revue . They would stay a couple of nights at Claridge 's and return on Sunday morning . On the Sunday evening a few local guests would come to dinner at Beeching . Havelock 's club was among the more exclusive , and it was hard for a young man just of age not to feel that admittance to it , as his father 's honored guest , symbolized something not to be lightly disregarded in the world 's scheme of things . The fact that Charles was about to disregard it , and not lightly at all , made him feel rather serious as he sat in the deep library chair before dinner and drank an almost sacramental sherry . The superbly proportioned room with its high ceilings and near-great portraits and vistas of wine-red carpet  --  all were alchemy to the soul ; it was a very wonderful life , doubtless , for those who were rich and important and well content to be both . A far cry from Ladysmith Road , and nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ( for Brunon had already replied that this was possible if one were content with a modest menage ) . It only remainednow for Charles to make the announcement , and because he would rather spoil an evening 's entertainment than a good dinner he had decided to bring the matter up while they were drinking coffee in the library afterward . There would only be a short time then before having to leave for the theater , but Charles did not see why the announcement should take long . The dinner was indeed good , though Havelock assured him it was just the ordinary club meal . " But I 'm glad I brought you here , Charles . I hope to put you up for membership one of these days , so it 's appropriate we should choose it for our celebration . Incidentally , I believe this is the first time we 've ever dined out together . " It was , not counting train dinners and times when they had both been guests of neighbors around Beeching . " You may not realize it , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know his son , and therefore easy to postpone the effort . I hope we shall make that effort jointly  --  from now on . " He waited for some response , but Charles could not think of any . " I 'd like this to be the beginning of confidence between us . Do n't think I shall be unsympathetic  --  even about Lily . " Charles flushed , resenting Havelock 's use of the first name , as if there were in it some intolerable assertion of intimacy . Yet he could not help probing the matter by answering : " Yes , you met her , did n't you ? " " I did , and thought her charming  --  though of course utterly unsuited to you , apart from her age . " " You mean her Cockney accent  --  all that ? " " Well , it would be no help , though she might manage to unlearnit  --  others have . Much more important is a lack in her of something you need , Charles  --  you especially . Even at her age one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dynamism  --  you need a woman who will push you ahead , not just freewheel along in any mood you set for her . " Charles was surprised by his father 's assessment of Lily ; he had expected the class angle to count much more . He said : " How about being happy ? Does n't that come into the scheme of what you think I need ? " " No one should put happiness first , Charles . One does n't die without it . From my own experience I can assure you of that . " " But would n't you have preferred to be happy ? " " Yes , if it could have come from achievement  --  from triumph . But not from mere being . Not just bliss . The Orientals believe in bliss  --  and look at them . Whereas , to take an opposite example , the Americans pursue happiness  --  it 's the pursuit they stress , not130 TIME AND TIME AGAINthe happiness itself . The phrase is even written into their Declarationof Independence  --  and look at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without finding it ? " " Yes  --  rather than finding it and languishing with it . " " I do n't much care for pursuing things . I suppose that 's whyI 'm no good at games . " " But you have n't the blood in you to languish . Or if you have , I do n't know where it comes from . " " From my mother , perhaps . I hope so . " " You mean you wish you were not my son ? " " I do n't think that follows . .. but have n't you wished it too  --  sometimes ? " They faced each other , as near to the core of some central issue as they had ever been , and aware of it . At that moment , if the message in Havelock 's eyes had persisted , Charles might have decided to leave Beeching and his father and never see either again . But it changed , and Havelock further eased the tension by a slow smile . " I do n't see any reason to bicker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily . " " That 's fine . I liked her too . In fact I still like her . And if I had the chance , now that I 'm of age , I 'd marry her . But you 've seen to it that I do n't have the chance . " " You can still have it if you want it enough . " " What do you mean ? " " Did n't Mansfield tell you anything ? " " He said nothing about . . . " Then Charles saw he had fallen into the oldest trap in the cross-examiner 's repertoire . " Oh , well , " he added , transferring some of his anger to himself , " you evidentlyknow it all , so what 's the difference ? Mansfield told me nothing except that he 'd given you his word , he 'd given you his word  --  he repeated that like a litany . " " Then he kept his word too . Quite a fellow . " Havelock paused . " Share another bottle of claret ? . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have here , but not bad , I think . . . . Sure you wo n't ? .. . Charles , let me be frank about all this . No father nowadays can put a final veto on a son 's marriage  --  and that 's as it shouldTIME AND TIME AGAIN 131be . But when the girl 's still so young  --  younger than you ever thought she was , younger than she told you she was  --  surely there 's a case for delay . . . or at least no need for any special hurry ? Mansfield and I agreed that if , at the end of a year , you and Lily both wished , you could begin meeting again . . . . And later still  --  say in eighteen months or two years  --  and she 'd only be nineteen then , remember  --  " " And in the meantime ? " " No meetings  --  no letters , communications of any kind  --  for a year  --  on either side . " " And what did she say to that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a scene , though . Bless her . " " But she agreed to the separation ? " " In all fairness , Charles , I must point out there was nothing else she could do . After all , a father does have some control over a seventeen-year-old  --  " " Did she know it was only to be for a year ? " " We did n't go into that with her . I did n't intend to with you , either , but I was tempted just now  --  I wanted to make your birthday a more cheerful one . Do n't be distressed . If , after a year , as I said  --  " " I know what you said  --  what I want to know is what she said . What were the words she used ? How did she take it ? I ca n't believe  --  " " As I told you before , she was perfectly charming  --  both to her father and me . Other girls might have been sulky or hysterical or hostile  --  instead of which  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps in her heart she felt the reasonableness of ours . " " Damn the reasonableness . " " A year is n't much , Charles . You once said that yourself . " Charles remembered and it made him bitter . " Yes , I suppose as a test of true love it 's romantic as well as reasonable . " " I 've weakened it , though , by letting you know it exists . I 've given you that much advantage . " 132 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 133 " Like throwing a dog a small bone . " " No . . . like revising  --  slightly  --  the handicap in a race . " " To make it more exciting for the spectator . " Havelock chuckled . " Your brain works rather well when you 're excited . " " I 'm not excited  --  not in the way you are , anyhow . And whether it 's a week or a month or a year , as far as I 'm concerned , I promise nothing , I 've agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes  --  gladly . I was equally glad to end my argument with Mansfield , in which  --  I think you tend to overlook this  --  I really succeeded in getting you out of serious trouble . . . . Tell me , incidentally  --  this is n't arguing , I 'm just curious  --  what would be your rating of Mansfield ? " " Rating ? I do n't know that I rate people at all . I thought him decent and honest , simple and  --  and  --  in a sort of way  --  sweet . Like a good apple . I 'd trust him . He 'd keep his word  --  even if he ought never to have given it . " " So it puzzles you a little  --  why he did give it ? " " Not when I think of you in action against him . You have a persuasive manner . " " And you think that was all ? I 'm really flattered , Charles . " Havelock poured himself more claret and again Charles saw , as in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even at the risk of unwisdom ; grim glee infesting the eyes , a euphoria that ran riot in the bloodstream , so that the cheeks reddened and shone with what , in an athlete , would have suited the moment of passingthe tape or vaulting the bar . " Charles , my experience in the courts taught me many things . One of them is the meaning of the word corruptible . ' It means more corruptible than the person using the word . ' Take plain bribery , for instance . With some people  --  those we call honest  --  a bribe has first to be explained as something else , something reasonable and fair and legitimate . Then cupidity must be aroused  --  a universal attribute  --  after which the payment offered must be large enough to administer a slight shock , so that the honest payee will wonder if it is a bribe , and  --  out of a mixture of doubt and guilt and gratitude  --  will wish to treat the payer with the utmost fidelity . It 's a veryinteresting process . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then retrieved it by a fast grab . " How do the Mansfieldscome into all this ? I 'll tell you . They 're quite hard pressed financially  --  buying their house through a building society and a radio-gramophone on the installment plan , all that sort of thing . He has steady employment , but poorly paid  --  only about five pounds a week , so the three girls and the boy have to help to support the family from their own small earnings . Clearly then , Lily could n't give up her job and live in the country for a year at their expense . . . so the fair thing to do was quite obvious . But  --  and this really is the point at last  --  how much do you think it costs a girl to live with her relatives in the country for a year ? " Havelock took out his wallet and pushed a folded paper across the table to Charles . It was a canceled check made out to and endorsed by Frederick Mansfield for two thousand pounds . Charles felt rather sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . You 've been clever , I admit that . It 's an odd thing to prove to me on the day I 'm supposed to become a man  --  that life 's full of wormholes and that you know how to find them . . . never mind , though , I 'll admit that also . But now I 've got a disillusionmentfor you . This career of mine you talk of  --  this career  --  this  --  this . . . " His eyes were riveted by something else on the table before him . It was a telegram , addressed to Charles at Beeching , from his college tutor . HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS ON OBTAINING NOT ONLY FIRST IN TRIPOS BUT YOUR THESIS ALSO CONSIDERED SO GOOD STRONGLY RECOMMEND SUBMISSION FOR THE COURTENAY PRIZE . . . . " It came yesterday , " said Havelock . " I took the liberty of holding it back for our celebration tonight . . . . Now will you have a little more claret ? We shall be late for the theater , but who cares ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as " nothing to complain of " without really wondering whether it had been or had n't . He was much too pleased by his son 's remark that he did n't look anything like his age ; and for a second he glanced in a mirror on the wall of the Cheval Noir that showed him trim and distingue ' in his dinner jacket . " Do you really think , Gerald , " he asked , fishing for another compliment , " I could safely allow a photograph of the author to be used as a frontispiece for my book ? " He laughed , of course , so that his son should know it was partly a joke . " You bet you could , " Gerald answered , loyally . " You 're really very handsome . You look a bit like Ronald Colman . " " And who is Ronald Colman ? " " Oh come now , Dad , you must know that . " " I will admit I do , but I find that a great impression can be made nowadays by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " You 're pretty smart too . " " Am I  --  away from dinner parties and agreeable company ? Sometimes lately I 've begun to doubt it . " At a remark like that Palan stepped into Charles 's mind like an unwanted guest who finds the door left open , and because he would otherwise have had to quell an almost unconquerable preoccupation Charles began to talk about Palan to Gerald , though of course without mentioning the name . " You know , Gerald , this job I have is n't the kind of thing it used to be . You may think me snobbish  --  it 's so easy to be thought that nowadays  --  but when I firstTIME AND TIME AGAIN 135started in diplomacy one could always assume that whatever the sort of fellow one was up against there 'd be at least some things in common  --  a professional training , for instance , and a minimum code of manners . Your opponent might trick you , he might be dishonest or corrupt  --  my father used to say that everyone was corrupt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling across the room like an auctioneer or belching after a heavy lunch . . . . But I must n't bore you  --  here 's Henri , wondering what we 're going to eat . Anything special you fancy , my boy ? This is an occasion , remember . " Henri presented the menu , which Gerald studied for a moment before replying : " My French is n't equal to it  --  maybe you 'd better do the choosing . " Charles smiled . He had been prepared for this . " How about soup to begin with ? May I suggest tortue claire ? " " Fine , whatever it is . " " Just turtle soup . And then perhaps sole Veronique  --  that 's sole cooked in wine and served with a very delicate cream sauce and fresh grapes . And after that I can recommend Henri 's way with a small chicken  --  poulet en casserole a la maison  --  " Gerald put down the menu and tried to catch Henri 's eye with a knowing wink , but of course Henri did not respond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick steak after the soup . " " Certainly , m'sieu ' . " Charles continued to smile ; he had been prepared for this too . All he said was : " One thing you never have to specify here , Gerald  --  everything always is good . . . . I think then a tournedosgarni for Gerald , Henri , with those little potatoes and champignons . I 'll have the sole . " Henri bowed . After he had left them Gerald said , still looking amused : " What first made you so interested in food , Dad ? " " To that question , Gerald , I had better quote an answer made by a titled Englishwoman to the Duchess of Marlborough  --  who , as perhaps you know , was a titled American . The Duchess was informed that considering it is the only pleasure one can count on having three times a day every day of one 's life , a well-136 TIME AND TIME AGAIN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 137ordered meal is of prime importance . . . ben trovato , possibly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Chablis , Henri ... . Try a small glass , Gerald , after the soup . " " Okay . " " It 's a very simple wine . " " I thought one ordered wines by the year . " Charles smiled again ; it was a matter he liked to have brought up . " Your millionaire junk merchant always does  --  he learns a few words and dates like Liebfraumilch Forty-seven and thinks it makes him a connoisseur . I myself would generally know the best years for a Burgundy or a champagne or a claret , but with a Chablis I leave everything to Henri , who was born quite close to the town of Chablis . . . . Is n't that so , Henri ? " " At Auxerre , m'sieu ' , " said Henri beaming . " Oh yes ? " Gerald suddenly spoke up . " I think I know of it . " He was evidently at pains to demonstrate that he was n't an ignoramus in every field of knowledge . " Did n't Clovis capture Auxerre from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the slightest idea , " answered Charles with keen delight , " and I do n't suppose Henri has either . So you put us both in our place . I took my degree in history , and I 've never regretted doing so , though I expect I 've forgotten 90 per cent of all I ever learned . One does , you know . But the other 10 per cent , if well cared for , can stand one in pretty good stead .. . . Thank you , Henri . Oh yes  --  and a small salade gauloise . " Henri bowed and left them again . " I 'm glad you 're interested in history , Gerald . Perhaps it 'll win you a Cambridge scholarship next year . " " I think I shall take economics . " " Well , that includes a lot of history  --  and vice versa . I remember when I was at Cambridge I used to go to Pigou and Keynes  --  that was at the end of the war which we now call the First World War , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase and was well trounced for it . " " Did you enjoy Cambridge ? " " Very much indeed . Of course I 'm fortunate to have it associatedin my mind with pleasant things  --  such as a First in theTripos and the Courtenay Prize . I did n't like games and I was too shy in those days to take part in Union debates , but I think I can say that Cambridge gave me , if nothing else , a sense of kinship with tradition  --  of being privileged , if the metaphor is n't too fanciful , to touch the pulse of five centuries with the tip of one 's little finger . I remember what a thrill I got when I found that a previous occupant of my college rooms had introduced the turnip from Holland in the late seventeenth century  --  thus becoming a benefactor of English agriculture , though certainly not of the English dinner table . . . . Strange , though , when one looks back on early life , how it 's the little incidents that stay in the mind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , being told that the desk I was working at had been used by Karl Marx when he was writing Das Kapital . . . . I mentioned that to Palan the other day , by way of making conversation  --  " " Who 's Palan ? " Charles had spoken the name without thinking , though now he had done so he felt it did not matter . " One of my opponents at the Conference . A disciple of Marx , of course . " " I think I 've seen pictures of him in the papers . Rather a jolly-looking fellow . " " He would certainly never forget to smile when being photo-graphed . " " What did he say when you told him about the desk at the British Museum ? " " Nothing . He just stopped picking his nose . " Gerald laughed . " You 've certainly got your knife into him all right . " " On the contrary , he has his into me . Mine 's quite incapable of piercing such a hide . And yet , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow . It 's hard to say why not . I have every reason to  --  personal , professional , and political . The other evening I was reading Montesquieu and I came across . . . " Charles stopped ; he saw that Gerald had glanced covertly beneath the rim of the table at his wrist watch . The fact that the138 TIME AND TIME AGAINmovement had been so carefully shielded , that the boy was clearly anxious not to hurt a father 's feelings , gave Charles a needlelike twinge in the center of his stomach . Was it possible that he was boring Gerald ? He continued hastily : " But do n't let me run on like this . Tell me more about your adventures in Switzerland . " " Yes , I 'd like to , before I  --  I mean , while there 's still time . I must n't forget my train . " " When did you say it was ? " " Er . . . ten-thirty . . . . " " And from the Gare St. Lazare , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right . . . . You were telling me earlier that you did some climbing . " " Oh yes  --  and golf and tennis too . At Miirren they were having tournaments at the hotel and I entered  --  just to get a game actually  --  never thought I had a chance , but I won the mixed doubles  --  my partner was awfully good . It 's a silver cup  --  I 've got it in my bag  --  like me to show you ? " Even had Charles been interested in games he would not have cared to interrupt a dinner in such a way . He smiled tolerantly and answered : " Oh , do n't bother now  --  I 'll see it when we 're at home . But I 'm very glad you were able to get the kind of holiday you enjoy . So many people  --  diplomats , for instance  --  have to enjoy the kind they get . When I think of all the time I 've spent at horrible little resorts that happened to be the only places where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dysentery , or some national holiday that was sure to be marked by anti-British demonstrations in the capital  --  " " You can put all that into your book , anyway . " " Oh certainly . And I shall . There was a place near Constanza , on the Black Sea ... " At ten minutes to ten he called for the bill and excused himself , ostensibly to make a telephone call . The only telephone at the Cheval Noir was in Henri 's little office at the rear ; but Charles did not actually use the instrument . Presently he returned to find Gerald ready to leave and a little fidgety . " Dad , it 's been a wonderful dinner  --  I 've had a grand time . " TIME AND TIME AGAIN 139 " My pleasure too , Gerald . I only wish we could have seen more of Paris together . " " Yes , so do I. " " Maybe we 'll have some other chance . " " You bet we will . . . . And Dad , why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rush you out like this  --  no need for you to see me off at the train , we 'll be meeting again in London so soon . " " Very thoughtful of you , Gerald .
