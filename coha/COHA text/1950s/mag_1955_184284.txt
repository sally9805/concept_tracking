It was siesta time in Pnompenh , the capital of faraway Cambodia ( pop . 4,500,000 ) . No tamarind leaves stirred in the bright blue sky . In the monasteries saffron-robed Buddhist monks recited their scriptures ; in the shuttered bazaars few bothered to tune their radios to a surprise communication from King Norodom Sihanouk , 32 , their saxophone-playing monarch who had won Cambodia 's independence from the French . " As your King , " King " Norodom was saying , " I can no longer be useful to you . I beg you , permit me to leave my gilded cage . " <P> In low-voiced Khmer , the recorded voice of King Norodom continued : " I announce publicly my intention to abandon power and the throne . I shall go down among my people , living with the humblest , taking nothing with me from the palace ... I designate my parents to succeed me . " <P> The Sick Old Man . King Norodom listened to the radio playback , tucked into a square meal prepared by D'Artagnan , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station wagon to change palaces with his parents .

King Norodom had a project afoot to disfranchise Viet Minh Communists in next April 's general elections , despite Geneva 's insistence that everyone gets a vote . The commission 's Indians , Canadians , and Polish Communists backed up the Democrats , and cautioned King Norodom not to violate Geneva ( which the Communists have already violated in half a dozen more flagrant ways ) . <P> " I remain at your disposal if you ask me to help you , " said Norodom , preparing to start a new popular movement among his people . Presumably , this meant that he would pit his own popularity , rather than that of his ministers , against Son Ngoc Thanh . Norodom 's course , as usual , was a little uncertain , but certain to be hectic .
