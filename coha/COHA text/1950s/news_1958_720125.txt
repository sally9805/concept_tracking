txt Administration officials . anticipating sharp criticism of their fiscal 1960 revenue estimates , leaped to defend the $77 billion figure as not only reasonable , but on the Conservative side . Policymakers indicated privately they believed the estimate , even though based on a whacking gain in corporate profits and a continuation of the record-breaking climb in personal income next year , was not out of line . They got some support , it 's understood , from Federal Reserve Board officials who were reported to consider the estimate as entirely realistic in view of the expected continued strong business recovery . The $77 billion of revenues anticipated would mean a gain of about $9 billion over the collections expected in the current fiscal year that ends next June 30 and , as President Eisenhower announced Monday , would permit the Proposal of a balanced budget for the fiscal period starting July 1 . To support the new revenue figure , the Administration is predicting that corporate profits will soar to something over $48 billion in calendar 1959 , a gain of about $12 billion from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personal income , the experts calculate , will mount to about $366 billion next year from the $353 billion or better now expected for this year . Already . the Treasury 's revenue estimate is under fire from Democratic lawmakers Rep. Reuss ( D. , Wis. ) charged " the Administration obviously overestimated receipts , cut spending without regard for the nation 's needs and then shouted ' funny coincidence , we 're in balance ' They should figure it again ' ' Chairman Cannon ID. , Mo. ) of the House Appropriations Committee said he was pleased at the prospect the Administration will propose a balanced budget , but said he had " serious doubts " revenues will increase as much as forecast . Officials have said all along the size of the Administration 's revenue figures will depend on what level of corporate profits can be reasonably estimated . Since the corporate tax rate of 52% takes about half of corporate profits , changes in the profits estimates can have a sharp effect on total revenue figures . The percentage tax take of personal income is much lower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uncle Sam can count on taking in about $150 million . May Be Conservative Conceding the predicted corporate profits gain for next year is a bit startling , they go even further and say the estimate may finally prove to be on the conservative side One official notes that the tendency in the past , in periods of rising business activity , has been for the Treasury to be somewhat conservative with its guesses . It 's also understood that Federal Reserve Board officials , who keep a close eye on the economy , believe the Treasury 's revenue estimates are " entirely realistic . " Some Government experts outside the Treasury , it 's known , believe the revenue estimates were arrived at without any stretching to get them up to the $77 billion mark . ' These specialists , noting the pattern of recoveries in the past and the performance of revenues , consider the Administration estimate low enough to provide considerable . cushion ? indicatmg that the Government might wind ' up the fiscal 1960 year with a surplus if it can get its $77 billion spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials believe , that corporate profits could rise to an annual rate of as much as $53 billion by the fourth quarter of 1959 , averaging out at around $50 billion for the calendar year . This would be so , they say , even if the economy slows clown its pace of recovery somewhat from the present vigorous rate . Thus , they reason , the $77 billion guess by the Treasury is not at all out of reach for fiscal 1960 . Policy makers insist corporate profit% already have made a dramatic comeback from recession lows , running at an annual rate of about $45 billion in the current quarter of this year This is up from the rate of slightly leas- than $32 billion for the first half of 1958 . Administration officials anticipate sharp criticism from Congress , as well as other sources , of the lofty-looking revenue figure for the new budget . Democratic lawmakers have already started attacking the figure as far too high . But policymaker5 insist the total is entirely supportable . Rather than being based on assumptions of a rapid rise In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new boom at full employment levels and full operation of now-spare capacity , officials claim their projection of a continued gain in the economy is modest and entirely within reason . Output Rate of $470 Billion This projection , officials indicate , would take the annual rate of gross national product ? an indicator of the progress of the recovery ? up to something more than $470 billion for the full year 1959 . This would put the  --  annual rate of the gross national product at over $430 billion . " If I wanted to assume a really optimistic rise , " claims one specialist , " I could have you up to a $500 billion rate by that time " The Commerce Department earlier this week put out preliminary figures indicating that the annual rate of gross national product  --  the value of all goods and services produced , in terms of present prices ? will run some thing more than $453 billion in the current quarter . As an indication of their caution in projecting the rate of the recovery , officials say , the prediction of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast of new car sales . Some question has been raised whether a sag in auto sales , when the expected market test comes in early 1959 , might slow down the pace of the recovery and have a considerable effect on the Government 's corporate profits collection . Administration economic experts concede they are looking for an improvement in auto sales next year , but claim their projections of business activity do n't contain forecasts of a sales upsurge anything like that in 1954-55 , when the auto industry put out more than 7 million cars . The officials refused to disclose their 1959 estimate . Rising Rate of Productivity The source of the huge expected gain in corporate profits , officials say , is the rising rate of productivity . This , they contend , Is the payoff of the big plant and equipment spending boom which preceded the recent recession . Now that the upturn is in progress , the specialists maintain , the benefits of the new costcutting machinery and more efficient methods adopted by Industry are beginning to pay off heavily in lower per-unit costs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some officials say . Many concerns have found they can produce the same amount with fewer people . cutting labor costa and reaping higher profits per unit of production . One measure of this gain in productivity , officials concede , is a fairly high continuing level of unemployment in relation to Industrial production . The Federal Reserve Board 's index of indusCrial prud0aliuii fletl lootioreel from the ' secession low of 126% of the 1947-49 average to 141% in mid-November  --  a gain of nearly 12% . But from the recession high of 7.6% for the seasonally-adjusted rate of unemployment in mid-August , the figure dropped to only 5 9% of the labor force by mid-November Officials are estimating the current annual rate of corporate profits at about ; 45 billion , but they claim this probably wo n't mean any sizable boost in revenues for the 1959 fiscal year . The assumption of corporate profits at $38 billion this year was based on a strong business upturn , the specialists say . The present high level probably wo n't bring in enough extra to materially change the estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported . This means , these officials insist , that the predicted deficit of some $12 billion for the 1959 fiscal year is still " a goqd figure . "
