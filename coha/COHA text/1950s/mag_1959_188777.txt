A Queen must do her job without a murmur , and Britain 's Elizabeth did it stoutly when South Africa 's new Governor General , Charles R. Swart , came to pay his first call . After the usual formal audience , she gave a lunch in Swart 's honor at Buckingham Palace . <P> But the British press was under no such restraint . Said the Daily Mirror : " Mr. Swart is the man who : FLOURISHED a whip to show how he himself would deal with restless Africans . DESCRIBED a wedding photograph of a white girl and an African as disgusting . SAID " when we defend White supremacy we are carrying out the Divine Will . " Her Majesty 's new appointee , noted the Daily Express , " opposed South Africa 's entry into the last war " on Britain 's side . <P> <P> THE MAN WHO HATES BRITAIN BECOMES GOVERNOR GENERAL , headlined the Daily Mail , and the Daily Herald printed a front-page editorial protest that the Queen should have to receive " the organizer of South Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans fear . . . who has preached flogging ever since he became Minister of Justice . " Added the New Statesman : " He does not hide his detestation of the British connection and his determination to break it . This man is now to kiss hands , receive the seal of office and thus become the official repository of British honor and approval " in South Africa . <P> Through it all , Swart , a onetime Hollywood bit-player cowboy who towers 6 ft. 7 in. , managed a perpetual wan smile , and by the time he left for home the hue and cry had died down , even if no one was happy that the Queen 's representative in South Africa should be a Boer with a pronounced anti-British bias ( based on childhood memories of being herded into a British prison camp with his mother ) , dedicated to making his country a republic and taking it out of the Commonwealth . The Labor Party 's executive committee last week passed a resolution urging party members to boycott South African goods for a month in protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
