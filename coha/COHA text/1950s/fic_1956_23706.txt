A Story by Frances McFadden Drawings by Maria Horvath T HE TWO little boys , Benjy and the Visiting Elk , were dawdling over their supper in the kitchen . " What 's that ? " the Visiting Elk asked , pointing to the whirligig in the center of the table . " It 's a Lazy Susan , " Benjy informed him . " Was it named after your mother ? " asked the Elk . " No , " said Benjy . Then , as he caught up with the implication his voice rose loyally , provocatively nasty . " No , Mr. Fatbottom . Of course not . My mother is n't lazy . " The Elk took up the challenge . " She does n't work as hard as my mother , " he said . " Oh , yes , she does , " said Benjy . She works harder than anyone in the world . " Susan , having a stolen cigarette on the tipsy long chair on the back porch , leaned her head against the sagging canvas . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bunk house were still unmade . The supper dishes still to he washed . She had n't taken the baby 's temperature . The two little girls had to be fetched front supper at the ranch five miles down the valley . And now the boys ' voices , floating through thescreen door , presaged one of those endless arguments , boast topping boast , that often terminated in violence . " She does n't shoe the horses , " the Elk was saying . " Dan is coming over from the ranch to shoe them . " " She could . She just does n't want to , " said Benjy . " She feeds the horses and she waters them . She has to fill that big trough by pail , all the way from the barn . And she cleans out the corral . You should see her raking up the manure and shoveling it . Sometimes the wheelbarrow is so heavy that she can hardly push it , and she goes like this ? " The cheek of him , thought Susan . The brazen cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , staggering dramatically around the kitchen , imitating her at her Augean labors . He was about to be eleven . Raking the corral was supposed to be his chore . She only did it because she was so sick of nagging . The Elk was unimpressed . " She does n't get down on her hands and knees and scrub floors . Do you know how many rooms are in my grandmother 's house ? Twenty ! Every summer my mother must scrub about half a mile . " " That 's not anything , " said Benjy . " Mom painted the jeep . And then she did n't like the color and she scraped it all off and the paint leaked into the engine , so she had to clean that . It took days and days . " " She has n't got five children , " said the Elk . " She has four , and with you that makes five , so it 's just as bad , " retorted his host . " Oh dear , " thought Susan . " Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjy shut up ? " He was a year younger than the Elk . In a battle of wits he did n't have a chance . But he was still fighting . Benjy : " Do you know how many meals my mother has cooked since she married my father ? Thirteen thousand , five hundred and sixty-five ! She figured it out once . " The Elk : " She has n't been married as long as my mother . My mother must have cooked fifteen thousand at least . " Benjy : " You 've got Mrs. PettschwaIk . " The Elk : " Not any more . " Benjy : " You 've got a dish-washer . " The Elk : " It does n't cook . " T HERE was a long silence . Still eating . That would mean the end of the Iamb that was to have held out through the morrow . Susan edged her chair sidewise , with her back to the screen door , slipped off her moccasins , and tucked her bare feet up on the porch rail . She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tout West qu'ordre et beaute , Luxe , calme et voluptd . Her thumb lay on the printed page . The nail was cracked and stained from the jeep job . She tucked it under a page , settled herself voluptuously , closed her eyes , and repeated the words in whispers , like an incantation . The back porch was Susan 's refuge . Built in silver-mining days , abandoned for years among other gingerbread ghosts , the house had been partially restored for rental . An inner wall had been broken clown to make a big dining-and-cooking kitchen . Since then , everyone used the new door which led out to a deck cantilevered over the lake . The old back steps , unused , had parted company and were slowly rotting , and the old stoop just hung there on the side of the house , half-sheltered by the remains of a trellis , one steer 's horn still over the door  --  a haven of obsolescence . Here , for a few stolen minutes every day , unless some holocaust interfered , Susan flopped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin and tap water , and set the glass on the floor beside her . But the gin , without company , made her cry . All July , every evening , she lay there , legs stretched out , feet on the rail , staring rebelliously at the lonely mountains . It had been a bad summer . A dead coyote had been found in the town reservoir , and that scarewas hardly over before the telegram came announcing that Sam , her Sam , had to fly on business to Istanbul  --  to Istanbul ! ? and could not possibly get West until the end of the summer . Then Rocket , the palomino , developed a limp , and Clover-bell , the old mare , guaranteed safe for widows and orphans , went wild and jumped the fence into the neighbor 's lawn , where she stood staring at Susan with a look of triumph on her long , stupid horse face , waiting to he coaxed home with oats . The baby was complaining of a mysterious itch . The Faucet of the kitchen sink , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the dry mountain heat , the green lawn withered , no matter how often she nagged the children to move the sprinklers . Then , as a final straw , the Juvenile Delinquent moved in next door , threatening to infect the whole neighborhood with his depravity . She was grateful when a wire came in August begging a bed for the tried and trusty Visiting Elk : but on the second day of his visit the Elk stepped on a rusty nail and was partially immobilized . Benjy and he spent hours hacking around , arguing endlessly , or practicing a dangerous exploit  --  climbing the gate post and trying to cross the top rail without holding on , while the horses , unexerciscd , stared over the fence and chewed up trouble . If the truth were to be told , Susan could not have weathered the summer without her legs . Her blonde hair had dried out like straw , and refused to curl . Her skin , that tanned so gloriously down by the sea , shriveled and scorched . The dust , blowing in clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her legs  --  long , slim , strong , stemming from neat thighs under faded blue cotton shorts  --  were getting browner and better every day . A lovely patina had de-veloped along the shinbone . When she kicked off the beaten-down moccasins , the instep was still arched , high and delicate , and her toes were straight and firm and unblemished as a child 's . THE JAGUAR noticed her legs straight away . She knew that the moment she blew into the post office to get the mail , with all five sweaty little children in their dirty levis trailing joyously after her . He had been reading the want ads for mail robbers that were tacked up on the post office wall , but he left off and joined the queue that waited for the wicket to open and disgorge its packets of newspapers and letters . She could see that he was not a local , nor was he one of the Terrible Texans . He did not radiate the boisterous good spirits of a dude on holiday . He wore gray flannels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at Susan 's legs respectfully , with mournful homage . Every day at mail time , Susan found his low-slung English car waiting outside , and himself waiting for the mail , and for her , in the queue . " He 's a famous author , " the Elk informed her one day . The lawyer he was to be had an amazing knack for picking up pertinent facts , but he had forgotten the name . " He 's getting a divorce , so he 's staying at the ranch , but he does n't like it muck Every day he drives his car to the junction and parks there just to see the Westerner go through . " The Jaguar was sitting in the doctor 's waiting room reading a book , the day of the rusty nail incident , when Susan blew in with the Elk for a tetanus shot . He was suffering from dust . His nose was twitching , and the eyes behind the glasses were badly inflamed . The doctor took the Elk first , and closed the door of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little waiting room stitch strongly of disinfectant , and , as if to further reassure the patients that they were in expert hands , a medical diploma hung on the wall beneath the head of a mountain sheep mounted on a plaque with his two forchooves . Susan picked up a mining journal . The Jaguar went on reading and sniffing . The clock ticked in its hollow case . The beady glass eyes of the mountain sheep stared into space . It was hot and oppressively still . The stillness was expectant . The slightest movement , the merest sound , even the rumple of a page turning or the creak of a leather moccasin seemed freighted with significance . Susan Lucked her ankles out of sight around the legs of her chair , dropped the magazine over her bare knees , and glanced uneasily at the closed door . The Jaguar shut his book , leaving a finger to mark the place , and spoke as if picking up an interrupted conversation . " You know , this man is really extraordinary , " he said , indicating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chapter on ' Notdoing . ' He 's talking about Sloth . " " About what ? " asked Susan . " Sloth . Primordial inertia . According to him , it took generations for the human race to wake out of it , and now , it seems , we 've gone too far the other way . " He took off his glasses , wiped them carefully , and put them on again . " ' In the East , ' " he quoted , ' " ' indolence is a beneficent state of being , releasing and replenishing the mysterious forces that lie hidden in the depths of the psyche . But in the Western world , conditioned by our Puritan tradition , we regard all inaction as sin . Guilt-ridden , we drive ourselves from busy-ness to busy-ness . ' Do n't you know any number of American women that fits to a T ? " " We do n't drive ourselves , " said Susan stiffly . " We are driven . " " That 's where you are so right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then you ca n't blame the woman , " said Susan . " Oh , he does n't . He 's all on the woman 's side , " replied the Jaguar . " And he 's not one of those lost-sex boys either . He thinks it 's all there , LAZY plenty , even in the good women  --  quotes around good ! ' The Jaguar 's voice was coolly clinical . " According to him , the trouble is spiritual . The American female is essentially a romantic and the American male must create a romantic ideal for her to live up to , or there 's all hell to pay in her unconscious . Her ego drives round and round on all those futile errands , while her libido takes to alcohol , or dribbles away in fantasy . The unconventional mind in the conventional body . That 's good , you know , damned good . " He chuckled , as if savoring a thousand pleasant memories . " Maybe , " said Susan . She wished she had not gone so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dust had settled in a tear duct and his eyelids fluttered wildly . In his misery he seemed quite harmless  --  in need of comforting . He held his glasses in his hand , expecting another seizure . " Have you ever been in the East ? " he asked . " The repose of Oriental women is simply amazing . They 're all instinct , not a shred of guilt . Like the women of Baudelaire . It 's very attractive , you know , to a Westerner . " " Istanbul ! " thought Susan in sudden panic . " Istanbul ! " " Of course it takes a different diet , lots of oil , and all that sort of thing . You ca n't do it on wienies and hamburgers , can you ? " The Jaguar turned his streaming eyes on her appealingly . " I mean , it 's just no use , is it ? The life urge does n't have a chance . " " 1 suppose not , " said Susan . " But what do you expect us to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Notdo , " he said . " Spelled in one word , active as distinguished from passive inaction . " THE DOOR opened and the doctor let out the Elk , proudly carrying a moccasin , one foot in a bandage . The Jaguar slipped his hook in his pocket and smiled amiably at the doctor . " You 'd agree with me , would n't you , Doctor ? Kipling was all wrong . The East and the West must meet . " " Well , we 're always very glad to see you folks out here , " said the doctor , holding the door wide to admit his next patient . " We must talk about this more , " said the Jaguar , as he rose . " Tomorrow ? The day after ? I have to go away for a few days after that to see my lawyer . How about next week ? " While she waited at the garage for a patch on the spare , Susan rehearsed the conversation in the doctor 's office , substituting for her own inadequate part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and woman , prefacing each in abject femininity , " You 're absolutely right , of course , but do n't you think , too , that . . . " Her lips held a secret smile . At the self-service market , in the lonely canyons of canned goods , she asked herself sensibly , putting the peas into her cart , and then the dried beef and the peanut butter and the cut-rate soups and the Trixo and the Shinex , why should n't she , a married woman with four children  --  for heaven 's sake  --  receive a perfectly presentable lone man ! She 'd done it a hundred times . Not really , she reminded herself as she wheeled the cart to the frozen foods . The others were friends of Sam and this was a total stranger JOHN BETJEMAN THE OLYMPIC GIRL The sort of girl I like to see Smiles down from her great height at me . She stands in strong , athletic pose And wrinkles her retrousse nose . Is it distaste that makes her frown , So furious and freckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I what she likes to see ? I do not know , though much I care . cite - tummy . . . would I were ( Forgive me , shade of Rupert Brooke ) An object fit to claim her look . Oh ! would 1 were her racket press 'd With hard excitement to her breast And swished into the sunlit air Arm-high above her tousled hair , And banged against the bounding ball " Oh ! Plung ! " my tauten 'd strings would call , " Oh ! Plung ! my darling , break my strings For you I will do brilliant things . " And when the match is over , I Would flop beside you , hear you sigh ; And then , with what supreme caress , You'ld tuck me up into my press . Fair tigress of the tennis courts , So short in sleeve and strong in shorts , Little , alas , to you I mean , For I am bald and old and green . invading her life without warning and without credentials . If she let him come once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't handle him : she had n't had much practice since her marriage . Or maybe she would n't want to when the time came . No , she thought , hovering over the bin and feeling the dank chill fanning her hot face , she should never have assented to his call . She must get out of it , quick . She must call the ranch and tell Dan to please say to the gentleman who owned the jaguar  --  how dreadfully promiscuous it sounded ) ? that she could not keep the appointment for next week . No explanation  --  that would end it . She hurled two cellophane packages of wienies into the cart and moved resolutely to the turnstile . She jabbed viciously at the choke and coaxed the accelerator with a practical toe . The jeep grumbled huffily , trembled a little , then shook all over and bounded off toward the library . She took the corners recklessly , calling crossly over her shoulder to the children . " Hang onto the baby , girls . Stop throwing those stones , Benjy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she came out of the library , she had under her arm , in addition to The Space Ship Twins and Ten-strike , a Tale of the Rockies and the Habits of the Beaver , a small volume of the poetry of Baudelaire . It was a relic of silver-mining days , the librarian said  --  left behind perhaps by the Frenchy that Frenchman 's Bend was named for . The pages were ivory and the print very small . When she reached home , she rescued it from the bag of spinach and tucked it behind the shutter on the back porch . A L L THAT week , after the meeting in the doctor 's office , Susan performed her tasks automatically , reserving herself for the moments of retreat . The reading of Baudelaire had become ritual , the sesame that released her from reality . Que raime voir , ch  --  re indolente , de ton corps si beau  --  the words fell from her lips like caresses , evoking perilous images . Not-doing had become a place , somewhere in the East , way East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the Jaguar's. were never quite clear . There was no beginning and no ending ; the scene always dissolved just before her surrender . 0 serments ! 6 parfum ! ti bailers infinis ! Sometimes she had the sensation of drowning ; she had to shake herself sharply , get up and walk dizzily about the yard in order to regain full consciousness . Then she felt wretched and a little frightened . She fanciedthe horses , with brute instinct , were staring at her reproachfully , and promised herself that she would forgo temptation in the future . But the next evening would find her stretched on a divan on a balcony scented with musk and havana , child of black midnights with flanks of ebony , running into trouble in her erring thoughts . On the evening before the Jaguar 's visit , her reveries were flavored with anticipation . Even now , she was thinking with a delicious sense of imminent peril , even now , his car may be racing down the Western slopes , skidding round the hairpin curves , so as not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the deck  --  in a dress , not in shorts . . . . But here the voices of the children in the kitchen , high and angry and piercing , broke in . She found herself taking sides in their argument . She could n't help it . Benjy was in the right ; the Elk 's mother did n't work nearly as hard as she did ; she was always hiring sitters , Compared to life here , in fact , she had it easy . The silence in the kitchen , the rattle of dishes in the sink and the drip-drip of the leaky faucet announced that supper was at . last over and that a sketchy rinse had been effected . Presently the two little boys crossed the yard in front of her . The Elk was limping , though his foot had long since healed . Benjy , half a foot smaller , bare brown skin showing between his shrunken shirt and his levis , was tagging after , hands in hark levi pockets . They were heading for the gate . Susan flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-air to blot out the corral . M  --  re des souvenirs , maitresse des waitresses , toi It was no use . Benjy 's voice was high and penetrating . He was half-way up the gate post , still arguing . " My mother can mend toilets , " he jeered . " You know , Hippo , that old toilet in the bunk house . You know that tank on top of it . Mom climbed up on a chair and reached her hand into the tank and bent a wire , and the water came in again and the ball floated and it was all Fixed . " " Score , " Susan said to herself grimly . The Elk sat down in the dust by the gate , removed his moccasin , peeled off one end of the adhesive , looked at his wound affectionately , pressed the adhesive back again . Then he delivered his coup de grace . " My father , " he said , speaking slowly and enunciating with awe  --  lul pride , " my father says that my mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unrefutable finality to his statement . ' Benjy has lost , ' ' thought Susan . Poor little booby , he tried , but he was n't quick enough . The Elk is just like his father , never satisfied until he has the last word . Now he 's had it , and they 'll shut up , thought Susan . But she had not reckoned with Benjy . On the top of the post , but still hanging on , he stopped . " My mother , " he said , " is n't going to haw a nervous breakdown . And do you know why ? " " Why ? " said the Elk . " Because tomorrow is my birthday , and do you know what ? " " What ? " said the Elk . " I ran do anything I like on my birthday . She promised me 1 could . She does n't know it yet , but I 'm going to rent a Geiger counter at Neil 's Hardware and we 're going to take the jeep and the horses and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's an old iron mine there . Dan says the rock is black and it looks like it might be a hot vein . We 're going to have to dig and dig . Maybe we 'll have to go a thousand feet . And we 'll have to bring back some big rocks to test again on Neil 's scintillator . Do you see the trail ? No , there , stupid . Look , way up there . It 's not a road . No cars can get through , but lom wo n't mind . She can make it . She 's strong . She 's stronger than anyone in the whole world . " He nerved himself to rise without support on the top of the post , crossed the top rail at a clip , stood for a second on the second post , then , with a frenzied yell , staggered , lost his balance and fell on the Elk . They rolled over and over in an amicable wrestle , unlocked , struggled to their feet and went chasing around the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , flipped her chair upright , shook herself , and put on her moccasins . A breeze had come up . The limbs of the aspens were bending , all their little leaves in a silver flutter . In the lake , under the dark pines below the deck , a green branch was moving across the face of the water , making ripplesbehind  --  a heaver getting ready for winter . The sun had gone down behind the mountains ; its sheer cliffs were a deeper , cooler red . Here and there , among the aspens on the upper slopes , there were splotches of autumn yellow . Susan swung herself off the porch and walked to the edge of the deck . She stood squarely , like Benjy , with feet apart and hands in her back pockets , supporting her sturdy spine . Her eyes followed the trail . It wound up and up along the old railroad embankment , then dipped into a canyon , disappeared , reappeared some five hundred feet above , climbing still higher toward the pass that led to Diamond Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber line , above everyone and everything . The gentians would be a wild dark blue . There would he patches of snow on the shale that tumbled down into the icy black water of the lake and the bleached bones of cattle littering the upper pastures . Who knows what else they might discover in the black rock of the wilderness ? The girls and the baby and the shovels and the Geiger counter would go with her in the jeep ; the boys would ride the horses with provisions arid sweaters in the saddlebags . They 'd have to start early if they were to get back before dark . No one would know where they had vanished . They 'd get out of town in the freshness of the early morning , while everyone was asleep . And by noon , if the jeep held out , they 'd be way up there in those wild fierce peaks  --  a mother and her young on their way to Eldorado .                   @ @
