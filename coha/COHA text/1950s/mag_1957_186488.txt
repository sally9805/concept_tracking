A college education is supposed to teach a student to think , but does the U.S. college succeed in teaching him to think for himself ? Not nearly enough , says Dartmouth 's Dean of Faculty Arthur E. Jensen . " Normally , the student goes through college with two crutches : the professor and the textbook . When he graduates , he sometimes stops his education because he no longer has those crutches . " Last week , after two years of study , the Dartmouth faculty approved a series of reforms that it hopes will change all that . Chief proposals : <P> &lt;J Beginning in the fall of 1958 , Dartmouth College will switch from two 16-week semesters to three eleven-week terms . Instead of taking five courses at a time and thus scattering their attention five different ways , students will be able to dig deeper into each subject by concentrating on only three . &lt;J Though students will take the same required courses as now , the nature of the courses will be changed . There will still be large lectures , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutorials and term papers involving original research . <P> &lt;J Instead of textbooks , syllabuses , and spoon-fed lectures , students will rely much more on their own wide ( and required ) reading of pertinent books and primary sources in the library . The whole idea , sums up President John Sloan Dickey , is to end the student 's " dependence on teaching , " and declare his " independence in learning . "
