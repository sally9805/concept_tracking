At a book-author lunch in Manhattan not long ago , Vladimir Nabokov faced a formidable force of 1,000 literature-loving women , and when it was announced that , as a feature of the lunch , one of them had won an autographed copy of Lolita , the excited " ooooh " could be heard all the way to Larchmont . Few novels have stirred up so much critical controversy as Nabokov 's account of a middle-aged psychopath 's passion for a gum-chewing , teenage " nymphet " ( TIME , Sept. 1 ) . <P> Frederic Babcock , editor of the Chicago Tribune 's Magazine of Books , proclaimed : " Lolita is pornography , and we do not plan to review it . " Other abstainers : the Christian Science Monitor and the Baltimore Sunpapers . But most publications did brace themselves to review the book , and attacks were vehement . The Providence Journal was tempted , but resisted : " After wading along with a kind of fascinated horror through 140,000 words , most readers will probably become bored . . . at times downright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Leslie Hanscom fumed that " there were moments . . . when my whole instinct was to land a Babbitt 's righteous punch on the super-civilized nose of the author . . . The novel has a tone which says that , if you can not swallow its exquisitely distilled sewage with a good appetite , then you 'd better go back where you belong and read Elbert Hubbard 's Scrapbook . " <P> Damns &; Praise . There was much applause , although not all critics seemed sure of what they were clapping about . The Atlantic 's Charles Rolo : " One of the funniest of the serious novels I have ever read . " Although the Jesuit weekly America was sternly critical , Thomas Molnar cheered in the liberal Catholic weekly , Commonweal : " It has been said that this book has a high literary value ; it has much more ; a style , an individuality , a brilliance which may yet create a tradition in American letters . " Said The New Yorker : " The special class of satire to which ' Lolita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has produced one of its finest examples . " <P> Critic Lionel Trilling praised the book , speculated about its satirical intent : " To what end is a girl-child taught . . . to consider the brightness and fragrance of her hair , and the shape of her body , and her look of readiness for adventure ? Why , what other end than that she shall be a really capable airline hostess ? " In Esquire , Dorothy Parker succumbed to Nabokov 's charms before the reader 's eyes : " Lolita is a fine book , a distinguished book-all right , then-a great book . "
