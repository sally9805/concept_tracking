Tektites are bits of semitransparent glassy stuff , mostly black or dark green , found in many parts of the world . They can not be explained as earthly minerals , so most scientists who have studied them believe that they come from space . In The Scientific Monthly , Physicist Ralph Stair of the National Bureau of Standards tells how he thinks they were formed and how they got scattered so widely . <P> Ordinary meteorites are believed to be bits of a " lost planet " that revolved in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter . For some reason , it broke up and filled the solar system with large and small debris . Nickel-iron meteorites are thought to be fragments of its dense interior , while stony meteorites are made of lighter material from near the planet 's surface . <P> According to Stair 's theory , tektites came from the lost planet too . He thinks that on its surface was light , glassy material that had separated like cream as the heavier metal and rock sank toward the center of the planet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but water erosion destroyed the glass . <P> On the lost planet there was no water , so the glass on its surface survived until the final breakup . Then chunks of it sailed around the solar system along with chunks of metal and rock . When they hit the earth 's atmosphere , the glass shattered into small fragments as soon as it began to get hot . The fragments fell to earth as tektites . When a fragment had the right shape to keep it from tumbling as it moved through the air , the molten glass that was wiped off the forward end frequently solidified as " wings " or an " apron " attached to the rear end . The glass that was melted can often be distinguished from the rest by microscopic examination .
