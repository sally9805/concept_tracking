Pierre Mends-France , son of a clothing manufacturer , is economist first , politician and statesman second . The argument which did most to convince him that the Indo-China war must be stopped was that France could not afford it . His chief ambition in North Africa is to stabilize the area , so that France can concentrate on what he calls the " real battlefront " : eco nomic reform . <P> <P> Mends-France believes that the limping French economy needs more reform than it did in 1789 . In his investiture speech , he promised to submit " a coherent program of recovery and expansion " by July 20 . Last week , a few days late , Mends kept his promise by laying before the National Assembly a dramatic blueprint for peaceful economic revolution . <P> Under the Oaks . Mends-France calls his program le New Deal null He worked most of it out himself . Back from Geneva , Mends set up shop outside Paris in a hunting lodge in the forest of Marly . Outdoors , under the oaks , Mends met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Simon Nora , 33 . He looked over blueprints proposed by Finance Minister Edgar Faure , and reworded by Boris and Nora . " I seem to find nothing but old projects , " he grumbled . " They are neither original nor daring . " He wanted a program of " total economic conversion , " to give a " psychological shock to the country . " <P> Our Main Error . " We have really only one problem , at home and abroad , " Mends-France says . " France is the one nation in the West whose production has not increased in a generation . It is the same now as it was in 1929 . . . * <P> " This explains a great deal the fear of the bourgeoisie , the social pressures , the lack of armament production , the low living standard . And our needs now are far greater than in 1929 . We have 2,000,000 more to be fed . Our export needs have increased . . . Our equipment is oldfashioned . We need new homes . It is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . " <P> Why is this ? Mends has an economist 's answer . " Our main error lies in spending for unproductive uses . First , spending for luxury goods by individuals and the state . Second , operating our nationalized industries at a deficit-coal , gas , railroads . Third , the exaggeration of France 's social laws-some of them tend to cut back production , not increase it . " <P> Sweeping Powers . Under the oaks at Marly , Mends-France rewrote Faure 's program to give expression to his own ideas . It took him 48 hours , practically nonstop . As presented to the National Assembly , last week Mends-France 's New Deal consisted of two documents : a one-page legislative bill , asking sweeping powers to run the . French economy by decree until March 31 , 1955 , accompanied by a 30-page " Exposition of Motives . " Main features :
