" Dear , dear ! How , queer everything is today ! . . . Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . But if I 'm not the same , the next question is ' Who in the world am I ? ' Ah , that 's the great puzzle ! " <P> Last week Alice 's admirers had a chance to share her puzzlement . Two different film versions of Alice , both billed as Alice in Wonderland , appeared almost simultaneously on U.S. movie screens : <P> Alice in Wonderland ( Walt Disney ; RKO Radio ) presents Lewis Carroll 's beloved classic in the characteristic vein of another children 's favorite , to wit , Producer Walt Disney , but it adds no glory to either . <P> Disney 's $3,900,000 Technicolored version draws on both Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass , skips many of Alice 's adventures , reshuffles others and caricatures most of its cast of 31 Carroll characters until they look more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired them . Only the most unyielding Alice cultists would begrudge Disney an adapter 's liberties , even when he feels forced to omit some favorite passages and characters , e.g. , the White Knight , Humpty Dumpty . But Disney 's liberties betray the tone and spirit of the original . The mock-solemn humor of Carroll 's perversely logical nonsense is all but lost in a jazzed-up jangle of gags , violence , slapstick and sticky jukebox ballads . Only rarely , e.g. , the scene where Alice ( spoken by Kathy Beaumont ) meets the hookah-smoking caterpillar ( Richard Haydn ) , does the Disney idiom enrich the fun instead of slanting it down to the comic-strip level . <P> Judged simply as the latest in the long , popular line of Disney cartoons , Alice lacks a developed story line , which the studio 's continuity experts , for all their freedom with scissors and paste , have been unable to put together out of the episodic books . Much of it is familiar stuff ; Carroll 's garden of live flowers prompts Disney to revive the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight youngsters , and there are flashes of cartooning ingenuity that should appeal to grownups . Funniest sequence : the famed mad tea party , which proves rollicking , not out of fidelity to Carroll , but because the Mad Hatter and the March Hare are faithful to Ed Wynn and Jerry Colonna , who speak the roles . <P> Alice in Wonderland ( Lou Bunin ; Souvaine ) , produced mainly in France with British actors and U.S. technicians , is the version whose release Walt Disney sued to block on the ground that it would cash in on his publicity ( TIME , July 16 ) . It turns its Alice ( Carol Marsh ) loose in a colorful wonderland of puppets and stylized sets after a live-action prologue purports to show how Mathematician Charles Dodgson cooked up his fantasy . <P> Though Alice is celebrated both for its satire and as Dodgson 's escape , in the guise of Lewis Carroll , from the repressions of his era and personality , Producer Bunin plays hob with the facts to picture the children 's tale as a virtual allegory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenuous parallel , he not only rigs the prologue but also changes such characters as the King of Hearts and the White Rabbit , who becomes a comic villain .
