txt Iowa'a hogs were living and eating as well as ever this week  --  but they now have become the poor relations on the farm . In the Midwest 's interior markets yesterday top grade hogs brought . from $10.25 to $10.75 a hundred pounds . This was the lowest average since Pearl Harbor day in 1941 . Farmers who sold their hogs ' this week took losses of from $8 to $10 on each animal that went on the block at weights from 200 to . 220 pounds . The heavier hogs and sows presented even more of a problem and the losses were higher . In recent- days hogs were arriving at the markets in record numbers , and this was the cause of the plunging prices . Late in 1954 hog numbers were down and farmers ' prices hit a lucrative high -a $26 a hundred pounds . By mid-September ? of this year the hundreds of new pigs raised in response  --  to these high prices began coming to market . The farmers ' share began to drop , reaching $15.70 . It then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Steady Decline This decline has been steady enough to start appearing in the wholesale prices charged by Iowa packers and in the retail prices housewives paid at Iowa supermarkets . The average wholesale prices of smoked . hams yesterday had dropped to 44 and 45 cents , coinpared with 541A cents on this date a year ago . Sliced bacon was down to 37 cents compared with 56 cents ; smoked picnic hams were down to 27 cents against 34 cents ; and pork loins were selling at 32 cents compared with 42 cents . In the supermarkets the number one grades of sliced bacon were priced at 49/ cents yesterday . A year ago they were at 69 cents . Pork loins were retailing at 35 cents compared with 59 cents . Skinless , shankless hams , a different cut from the wholesale types listed above , were selling at 55 cents . Last year they sold at 69 cents . The decline in pork prices has brought a corresponding rise in consumption . With the greatly increased hog numbers coming to market , the volume of pork slaughtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the supermarkets nearly three times as much pork has been sold in recent weeks as was sold for a similar period last year . The hog decline was the primary factor in pulling farm income down two more per3entage points from mid-October to mid-November . The level was 7 per cent lower than for i. year ago . The price index , based on , the percentage of the 1910-14 average , - , was 225 , com- pared with the record of 313 in February of 1951 . This depressing trend was in sharp contrast to the average weekly pay of factory workers . This hit a high of $79.52 and was $5.95 more than a year ago . This trend also was causing a new political interest in the pig . Midwestern officeholders of both parties have been pleading with the Department of Agriculture to do something to stop the decline . And there is a saying in Iowa that hogs can not vote , but they often swing elections . The hog . one of nature 's greatest food factories , long has been the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handy receptacle for most feed raised on farms . He can graze in a field or eat harvester grain . He enters life as a part of a large family , and he can be readied for market in a relatively short time . But this adaptability has a built-in hazard . It is easy for a farmer to increase quickly the number of hogs he raises , and when the market becomes alluring it has been his habit to rush more pigs into the world . This tendency , in turn , has caused hog prices to fluctuate widely es the farmer and his neighbors get into or out of the pork production . The economic history of a contemporary Iowa hog and his effect of a typical Iowa hograiser may be detailed through C. S. Stensland , who farms near this central Iowa village . Mr. Stensland has 270 acres . on which he grows corn , oats and pasture grasses . This year he has boarded a hog herd of 500 head . Many of these have been marketed and the rest now make the trip as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday was born last spring . In the five or six months he was growing to a preferable weight of 200 or 225 pounds , he grazed in the pasture during the summer , gleaned dropped corn in the corn fields after the harvest and was " finished off " with more corn handed to him in the feed yard . Treated Against Disease In this period he was treated against diseases , given special vitamin and growth stimulants and antibiotic compounds , all of which protected his health and speeded his growth . To fatten him in this period , and to provide him with warm , dry housing . Mr. Stensland figures he spent about $15.35 for each hundred pounds the hog gained . Included in this estimate was the depreciation on the various farm implements Mr. Stensland used to raise his corn and oats and get his feed to the hog . If this hog had been offered for sale yesterday at 200 pounds . he would have brought $20.50 from the stockyard operator who would come to the farm to pick him up . This hog would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to absorb through other operations on the farm . Mr. Stensland 's cost estimates are considered average . His operations are normal for this area and his experience was similar to that of hundreds of other Iowa farmers . , Profit Not Widened The problem of handling this hog at the slaughter house has been eased slightly for the packer . The hog could be bought at a low price . In turn this lower price was encouraging the housewife to buy more pork . This made it less difficult for the packer to find a wholesale market in which to place the dressed hog because he could offer this meat at a lower wholesale price . But , according to the packer , this did not mean that his margin of profit from the hog had widened . A packer 's success depends on his ability to guess , each day , the price he can afford to offer for an animal and how much demand there will be for the hogs after slaughtering . The supermarket operator , in turn , must guess how much meat and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . At Dahl 's , one of Des Moine 's larger supermarkets ; the costs , of handling and displaying meat have remained relatively- ' ? tire same during the last two years .. The wholesale price paid by Dahl 's for pork have varied proportionately with the prices paid to the farmers . But it generally has taken from three to four weeks before the corresponding changes in the livestock markets have been reflected in wholesale prices paid by the supermarkets . As for the future , the Department of Agriculture 's estimates show no prospects for immedrate improvement in hog prices . The number of pigs born this fall and destined for market text spring is expected to be 11 per cent higher than last year . And consumption was not expected to increase enough to absorb this . What , then , are the . farmers going to do about it ? Mr. Stensland is planning to cut down the , number of pigs who will be born on his farm this spring . He has reduced his breed sows from forty-two to twenty-five . He hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , the top of the current cycle of hog populations would be reached this summer . After that , the reduced numbers might help improve the markets . " I am losing a lot of money on the hogs I sell today , " Mr. Stensland said . " But that does n't mean I 've lost money all year . I was lucky enough ' to get a lot of them to market before the price went too far down . But a lot of farmers did n't manage to do this and they are hurt . I ca n't afford to take that same chance next year ; so I am cutting back . " Mr. Stensland does ' not think the hog buying program started last month by Ezra Taft Benson , Secretary of Agriculture , will help the hog producer very much . So far the Department of Agriculture has bought 13,500 , - 000 pounds of canned pork for school lunch programs and other uses . By August , 1956 , the GoVeminent plans to buy a - total of 170,000,000 , ? spending about $85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases are supposed to increase the demand for pork ' and stabilize the market . " Bill they are too little find too Stensland said . " Mr. Benson killed the psychological effect because he waited too long to buy and a lot of farmers waited for him to move . When he did , it has n't helped the market any and now the farmers will have , to sell their hogs at lower prices . " If the hog numbers can be reduced by 5 or 10 per cent by next summer , Mr. Stensland belives things will be better . Until then , the ? only real defense a good farmer has is to send his hogs to market at the most ' favorable time and take his chances on the prevailing prices .
