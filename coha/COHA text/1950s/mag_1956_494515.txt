THAT VITRIOLIC question , put to Mr. Selwyn Lloyd on the day he announced Britain 's unconditional with ? drawal from Port Said , will give the outsider some idea of the anti-Americanism that has been sweeping through England during the crisis . The words , it should be observed , do not come from any of the recognized critics of America ? from Mr. Aneurin Bevin , Mr. Silver ? man or their friends on the Left of the Labour Move ? ment . They were spoken by Sir Ian Horobin , a Conserva ? tive M.P . and a member of the Suez Group on the extreme Right of the party . While it would be foolish to overestimate the impor ? tance of Sir Ian Horobin , it would also be misleading to suggest that he is a lone figure . Anger against America was growing even before the manifest collapse of Britain 's Middle East policy . At the Conservative Con ? ference in October , Captain Waterhouse , the leader of the Suez rebels , talked of Mr. Dulles ' " election antics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to Mr. Dulles ' " rock ' n roll technique . " Since then other members of the Group have made speeches critical of America , and , on a higher Ievel , Lord Hailsham , the peppery Minister in charge of the Admiralty , has been more than usually unrestrained . " We will not , " he said the other day , " be sermonized . We do not propose to be sent to Coventry . We do not wish to hear any moral lectures from those whose moral weakness and incapacity to see the facts was the precipitating factor in the crisis . " He even went so far as to talk of repudiating his American blood . Speaking as " the son of an American mother , " he said , " I am proof against anti-Americanism , but . . . for the first time since the war , almost for the first time in my . life , I have begun to find it hard to say that I am half American and , still harder to say , I am proud of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a motion " that ? this House congratulates the Foreign Sec retary on his efford to obtain international control of the Suez Canal and deplores both the resolution of the General Assembly calling for immediate and unconditional withdrawal of British and French troops from Egypt and the attitude of the United States of America which is gravely endangering the Atlantic alliance . " Within a short time the six sponsors had collected 110 supporters and , before the week was out , the total had reached 130 . In fact only the Left of the Party ? led by Sir Edward Boyle , who has disagreed with British policy from the start ? has resisted the temptation to blame America for his government 's mistakes . The critics believe that they have a strong case against the State Department in general and . Mr. Dulles in par ? ticular . First of all , they complain that Mr. Dulles has never properly understood the importance of the Middle East but has seemed to look upon the tensions there in terms of a squalid intrigue on the part of outmoded Colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscalculation of the utmost gravity . The Middle East has always been the most likely stage for the overture to Armageddon , since its profound instability and hysteri ? cal nationalism was bound one day to attract Russian intervention . The prize was great ? the economic crip pling of Europe by cutting off the supplies of Middle East oil ? and the price negligible ? the sale of armaments from bulging store houses and the loan of a few techni ? cians . The British came to feel that Mr. Dulles ' blindness to this menace and his apparent lack of any policy was all the time increasing the danger and weakening their power to resist it . The second complaint is that the Americans started the present crisis by the sudden decision not to finance the Aswan Dam , and indeed if that is really what happened Mr. Dulles was guilty of an extraordinary act of folly . Unfortunately , we have learnt in these last few weeks to take nothing on trust and to re-examine even those facts that at one time seemed beyond suspicion . Was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest version of the affair hardly suggests so .. According to this account , it was Sir Anthony Eden who persuaded the Americans to take part in the Aswan project . Fourteen months ago , in October of last year , he is said to have summoned an American official at one o'clock in the morning ; he argued , apparently on the edge of panic , that Nasser must be supported by the West or he would be forced to go over to the Russians . But in May , seven months after the Americans had reluctantly agreed to the Aswan scheme , Sir Anthony changed his mind and , on his suggestion , the two countries agreed that they would quietly allow the proposal to lapse . Indeed noth ? ing more might have been heard of it had not a spokes man in Cairo forced Mr. Dulles to make the Aswan announcement by saying that the Egyptian Government had agreed to America 's terms . If this is the real story , the British are as much to blame as the Americans . The question of the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association is still more difficult to fathom . The British insist that they were all set to go to the . Security Council when Mr. Dulles came forward with his idea of the Association and per ? suaded them to postpone any appeal to ' the United Nations . What is incontestable is that the two sides held completely contradictory views of the functions of the new organization . The British saw it as a means of put ? ting , powerful pressure on Colonel Nasser , of forcing him , with American co-operation , to accept the proposals laid down for international control of the Canal by the 18 nations at the London Conference . That was the impression , they say , that Mr. Dulles first gave them , and no sooner had they accepted it than Mr. Dulles went back on his word and presented the Association to the world as a negotiating body . The trouble is that the scent is now growing so cold that we may never know whether this was an honest misunderstanding or whether Mr. Dulles changed his mind after getting the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar of the United Nations have not been exactly tactful . Or realistic . The United Nations is not yet the perfect court of international justice that the world needs , and indeed some of its decisions during the past few weeks have been singularly misguided and prejudiced . If Britain and France are to be sentenced for their adventure in Egypt , how much greater should have been the condemna ? tion of Russia 's brutalities in Hungary ? The United Na ? tions has still done nothing about the abduction of Nagy , and in fact the kidnapper is still a welcome member of the club . As M. Henri de Jouvenel sensibly pointed out the other day , " A jury is surely lacking in the essential vir ? tue of objectivity when it almost shuts its eyes to what Soviet Russia has done and is doing , to what Nasser has done or is doing , and focuses its attention mainly upon the fault of Britain , France and Israel . " In their dislike of the old motto , " My country , right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite absurdity and say , " My United Nations , right or wrong . " There is even a sense in which the UN is a more , imperfect instrument than the despised League of Nations . The League at least had the courage to impose sanctions against Musso ? lini during the Abyssinian war . But , fundamentally , British Conservatives feel that America behaved more like an enemy than an ally during the closing drama of the dispute . It is not only that she lined up against Britain at the United Nations : by'refusing to talk , at any level and by making it plain that she would give Britain and France no help while their troops remained in Port Said , she was in effect applying economic sanctions against the two countries . The charge would be more convincing if it were confined to American policy before the Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt . As the weeks went by and international control of the Canal became more and more improbable , the British grew to feel that Mr. Dulles was secretly on Nasser 's side . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of statements and actions that prove the opposite . But a misunderstanding of this magnitude should not have happened and Mr. Dulles can be rightly criticized for an appalling lack of imagination . On the other hand , it is difficult to see , how the British can think that they have a case after the ultimatum . It is not only that they acted without telling ' their chief ally ? if nothing else were involved , that would merely be a discourtesy . The British roused the President for two , reasons . In the first place they used weapons and equipment paid for by . America and earmarked for NATO weapons , in fact , that were never to be employed outside NATO without American consent . It is not a triv ? ial point . American arms were being used in a private act of aggression and therefore America herself was being subtly implicated in a war that was again.t her interests and offensive to her ideas of morality . That might cer ? tainly have been the conclusion of the uncommitted na ? tions of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused by the adventure . The second point is much more serious . The President is a soldier by training and instinct , and he would be the first to realize that by denuding Europe of men and weapons , the British were almost inviting the Russians to march in The famous trip wire no longer existed , and America would have been forced to drop the hydrogen bomb since there would have been nothing else to stop the Russian advance . Basically , the reason for the Presi ? dent 's anger must have been because the British and French had endangered American security . It is a fact that British Conservatives seem incapable of appreciating . There is clearly very little comfort to be drawn from this sorry tale . Resentment has been added to misunder ? standing , hurt pride to honest differences of policy : it is almost more a matter for the psychologist than for the statesman . Lord Hailsham drains off his American blood but continues to remain in a government that is hoping for American aid . It would not be so bad if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism : if they pulled up the drawbridge , declared an economic siege , and exhorted the British people to abandon their television sets and free false teeth for the bracing pleasures of aus ? terity . And this , is precisely what British ' Conservatives will not do : the process is too painful , the implications too frightening ? and there is that little matter of a general election in a year or two So the contradictions go on and on At one moment British Conservatives complain that the Americans have no Middle East policy and then , in the next breath , purple with anger because the United States is moving into the Middle East . The same confusion comes out yet again in the ap ? proach to the defense problem . For years Britain hasbeen crippling herself by spending far more on arma ? ments than any of America 's allies : it is the basic cause of her recurring economic crises . The government is now talking of reducing the costs by about a third , but to do this not only needs resolution but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Her Majesty 's Ministers . For to cut back arms expenditure on this scale is not just a matter of juggling with figures : it is to acknowledge that Britain is no longer a First Class Power . This is precisely what Conservatives will not admit ? in fact , can not admit without at the same time saying that the Suez adventure was a failure because it was founded on a profound misconception . They are caught in a baffling frustration , since they can neither call the British to an heroic life of self-denial nor accept the necessities of the alternative . These things must be understood if the Anglo-Ameri ? can alliance is ever to be restored . For a long time we have been bamboozled by the platitudes spoken at Anglo-American dinners ? " our common heritage , " our spizi ? tual values " and all the rest of it Reality is the only firm basis . And perhaps the real criticism of Mr. Dulles is not that he failed to do this or that during the Suez crisis but that he has never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , a gran I strategy . Indeed Western policy is depressingly reminiscent of a battered old ship where the members of the crew spend their time in running from one hold to the next , plugging the latest leak with whatever may come to hand . It is surely high time that we made ourselves a new hull .
