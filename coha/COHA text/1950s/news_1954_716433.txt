txt A strange turn in the Senate debate on . Senator Joseph R. McCarthy today brought a statement by Senator Wayne Morse that President Truman had permitted him to use a " top ' , secret " document in the 1952 Presidential campaign . This document , dated Sept. 26 , 1947 , set forth the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , of which General Eisenhower was a member , that American troops be withdrawn from South Korea . The memorandum was addressed to Dean Acheson , then Secretary of State , and was signed by the late James Forrestal , who at the time had been Secretary of Defense . It was used in 1952 to counter the argument of General Eisenhower , then run ning for the Presidency , that the troop withdrawal had been a political decision , reached by the State Department , rather than a ' military decision . Senator Morse , an Independent of Oregon , read the memorandum in a speech Oct. 27 at Minneapolis in reply to a speech General Eisenhower had made at Detroit three days earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted as saying he had " every confidence in Mr. Morse 's veracity " but had " no recollection of any such document . " The use of the document ' was recalled today by Senator William F. Knowland of California , the Republican leader , in charging Mr. Morse with employing the very tactics he had eon , demned in Senator McCarthy . One of Seven Reasons Given Senator Morse has contended that one of seven reasons Mr. McCarthy should be censured is that he had " received and made use of confidential information obtained from a document in the Executive files , upon which document the Federal Bureau of Investigation has placed its highest classification * * " The Majority Leader , speaking before Mr. Morse reached the Senate floor , said he thought the Senate-and the country were " entitled to have these facts before them in connection with the allegations made in the present resolution of censure . " Shortly thereafter , Senator Morse , who broke with the Republican party over the type of campaign conducted by General Eisenhower , said that Senator Knowland " apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis speech in 1952 . He asserted that the day after the Eisenhower speech at Detroit he had had a telephone conversation with Mr. Truman in which they " discussed that memorandum and the unanimous Joint Chiefs of Staff backing of that memorandum . " " The President of the United States made perfectly clear to me , " Mr. Morse said , " that there was no doubt about the fact that at the time when Dwight Eisenhower was Chief of Staff of the Army he strenuously urged that the troops be taken-out of South Korea . " The President of the United States then authorized me to quote the contents of that memorandum in my Minneapolis speech ; and the President of the United States sent , directly from his office to my office , the memorandum . There is no question about it that the President , then and there by that authorization , declassified the document which he , as Commander in Chief , had the power and authority so to do . " When the Oregonian had concluded , Senator Knowland said he was " deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innuendo ' Mr. Morse insisted that he had said the same thing " on other occasions and in many , places " and thought it was " common knowledge . " " Any r ' charov of any innuendo or any implication that the Senator from Oregon acted , in relation to any classified document , without the compete authority of the Commander in Chief , " said Mr. Morse , " * * * simply is a charge that can not be squared with the facts . " A search of back newspaper files discloses that , while the accounts of 1952 hinted that Mr. Morse probably had received his information from Mr. Truman , , there was no official announcement to that effect . As late as Oct. 31 , 1952 , the State Department still held the document was " top secret . " President Truman publicly declassified it on Nov. 2 . He expressed the hope , as he acted , that the step would " set this controversy at rest and will in some measure protect those who have not been able to protect themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrecy classification which must necessarily cover a great deal of their work .
