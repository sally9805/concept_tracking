Dave Chasen 's deluxe short-order stand in Beverly Hills , California , a simple snack of cracked crab and deviled beef bones , plus po-tables , can be had for as little as some people pay for a suit with two pairs of pants . One evening about a year ago a festive party gathered in one of the rooms which its mop-haired proprietor rents for private parties . The guests , who had been invited to celebrate a wedding anniversary , stood watching a peewee-sized movie star named Jane Allyson slice a cake . She wore a triumphant , " some people think they 're so smart " look , for the lettering squirted on the cake 's surface from the nozzle of a chef 's pastry bag read : THEY SAID IT WOULD N'T LAST . The occasion was a thumbing of her snub nose at Hollywood 's prediction that her marriage to cinema and radio headliner Dick Powell would endure even more briefly than is customary in a community given to put-and-take matrimony . Five years before , when she was twenty-one and had married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynical prophecy that the marriage would shatter quickly , and had waited , broom in hand , to sweep the pieces into the ash can . In all fairness , there had seemed to be more than the usual reasons for these bleak predictions . Allyson had been described as " shuttling back and forth between being an adult and herself " ; " a grown-up Margaret O'Brien " ; " the girl who stood longest of anybody where the brook and river meet , womanhood and girlhood sweet . " It is easily possible that no one else has been so slow to emerge from adolescence since Peter Pan failed to make it . She is twice a mother now  --  once through adoption , more recently through the usual processes  --  but at the time of her wedding she resembled a permanent Junior Miss who infinitely preferred clam-digger pants and pigtails to minks and sleek hairdos . She still resembles one . Her favorite posture continues to be sitting spraddle-legged on a floor rather than in a chair . Until a short time ago she bowed to no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single blob of bubble gum , although her demonstrations of this talent were sternly forbidden by her studio 's management after a mouthful of the stuff exploded unexpectedly and smeared her with stage make-up from brow to chin , thereby delaying a scene and running up the overhead in costly fashion . She has the husky voice of a little girl endlessly battling a sore throat . Her laughs bubble straight upward from her stomach , as a child 's laughter does . When the Powell-Allyson engagement was announced , friends advised her against marrying him . They said , " You 're young . You 're a flibbertigibbet . You 're a hotcha girl . You do n't know the first thing about running a house . " Powell chuckles when he remembers the events leading up to Hollywood 's prophecy that their marriage would be a fleeting one . He 'd already been married twice , and although he 'd been seeing a lot of June for six months , he was n't seriously consideringmatrimony again . But when he drove her home one night and they stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silence , then she said , " I 'd like to know just what your intentions are . " It made Powell grin to hear his diminutive companion , who had once been a Broadway chorus girl , use a phrase that is ordinarily found only upon the lips of prim misses between the covers of Victorian novels . " I thought she was kidding me , so I decided to kid right back , " he said . " I told her , ' I 'd better ask my business manager what my intentions are . He says I 'm already supporting too many people . ' " Allyson was n't kidding . She stepped out of the car , drew herself up to her full height of a fraction over five feet , and said , " I do n't think I 'd better see you any more until you make up your mind . " When Powell reached home the grin was gone from his face . He had grown thoughtful and decided that it might be a good idea to call her up and say good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he detected a sob or two , and he hastily drove back " to talk things over . " " I guess I got pretty Victorian myself at that point , " he said . " I told her , ' I love you , but since my last divorce is n't final , I 'm not in a position to ask you to marry me . ' " Allyson looked him in the eye and said , " I love you , too , Tommy . " " A guy named Tommy had been my main competition for her , and a lot of men would have been peeved at her slip of ( Continued on Page 68 ) June Allyson , out of circular for a few in ths , stops to dial with Actress Lana Turner on t he set at M-G-M , where Miss Turner is working on a picture . GEN , T$4 , HOLLYWOOD 'S CHILD BRIDE ( tkititiettied from Page 31 ) the tongue , " Powell continued . " All I could think of was how much I 'd have hated it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That cinched things . " One of the factors that Hollywood 's calamity howlers had n't counted upon was the fact that Powell did n't make the error of trying to match his wife 's youthfulness by acting terribly , terribly young himself . He made no attempt to give the situation a light touch by introducing his spouse with such heavy-handed jests as " I want you to meet my daughter . " " Jokes like that can backfire , " Powell said . " Once you let yourself get on the defensive about being older than your wife , your marriage is a dead duck . " Allyson 's early efforts to transform herself into a homemaker , hostess , interior decorator , landscape gardener and larder stocker were of the intense , " I 'm knocking myself out to be a good wife " variety . The results were much the same as might be expected if a small daughter were summoned in from her rope skipping to manage the household during her mother 's absence . When she was asked by a wood dealer how many cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid her ignorance of such matters behind what she fondly hoped was a casual manner . " We 'll need about eight , " she replied , then spent the next few days peering out of a window to find out how much eight cords would really be . When her back yard turned into a logjam that would have flabbergasted a crew of lumberjacks , she found out . Having spare time on her hands one day , she decided to save an interior ( Cont ? ed on Page 71 ) ( Cont 41 fnan Page 68 ) decorator 's fee by redoing her house herself . Laboring under the impression that she had found an antique dealer so dumb that he did n't know the value of the rarities he had assembled , she stripped a seedy secondhand furniture store of its spavined chairs and tables . When her loot was delivered , Powell paled visibly and had it sent back . It was months before she could summon enough spunk to fire a slovenly domestic . Locking herself in her room , she practiced her part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to hear herself say , " I wish you 'd fix me a sandwich and a glass of milk , if it 's not too much trouble . " In the end , Powell was driven to dispatching his wife on a phony errand . When she came back the household staff was reduced by one . " She clung to my arm at cocktail parties so desperately I thought she would break it , " Powell said . " So , at such affairs I made a point of getting away from her and leaving her on her own . She did n't think she knew what to say . ' What do Hollywood people talk about ? ' she kept asking me . ' The same things they talk about in Peoria , ' I told her . " Although she has since learned to fend for herself at cocktail parties , Pow-ell 's helpmate has learned little or nothing about compounding the drinks that give those parties their name . Her idea of getting through such an alcoholic gabfest is to make her half glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a guest at one of her own ' parties , she was instructed to " make it two fingers of liquor , the rest water . " She returned with a concoction that looked like weak prune juice . " What , " asked the guest skittishly , shying away from the potion , " is that ? " " What you wanted , " she said . " Two fingers of sherry in a glass of water . " She still clings to a schoolgirlish penchant . for note writing , and Powell finds scribbled messages from her under the telephone or tucked in his razor case . A typical one was " Would n't it be nice if the Powells had a silver tea service ? " Last year he began to find bits of paper all over the house bearing scribbled names , accompanied by various comments . One read : " Not Penelope ? that stinks . " Despairing of ever having a child of their own , Allyson and Powell bad adopted one  --  a girl they called Pamela . Then , in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling such tidings , the gossip columnists announced with many a happy chortling , " Junie Allyson is going to have a baby of her very own ! " The new snowdrift of paper that littered the Powell home indicated that Mrs. Powell was brooding over the selection of a name for her expected offspring . She converses with Powell in a private language of her own that is intelligible only to him . This means of communication is described by Edgar Bergen , an expert on odd ways of talking , as " a blend of Mortimer Snerd 's voice , baby talk and a Brooklyn girl 's idea of a Southern accent . " A friend of Powell sums up the actor 's life with June in this way : " If you put it into one line of dialogue , that line would be , ' How 's that again ? ' " But white she is sometimes " my idiot . wife " to her husband ? he says it affectionately ? she is also " completely captivating . " To other folk she is an infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the chamber-of-commerce delegation appointed to welcome her to San Francisco , she is " disconcertingly disarming . " He regarded his chore as greeter-in-chief to a film celebrity as undignified and , therefore , distasteful . When he met her she was dressed in a cotton wash frock . She flapped no long , smoky , artificial eyelashes his way ; employed no elaborate ma ke-up.Studying her , he said in startled tones , " You do n't look like a movie star ! " Batting her eyes at him brightly , Allyson said , " Why , bless your little pointed head ! You say the sweetest things ! " Allyson 's entourage watched the Golden Gate City dignitary with a horrified fascination . They expected to see him swell , purple in the face with injured dignity and burst with outraged pride . But slowly a smile cracked the hauteur of his face . One of those who had accompanied her from Holly wood later said , " After that , you could n't tear him away from her . " But the confusion in the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying opinions that roll in all directions through the minds of those who know her best . " She has become so popular with the fans that she is entitled to the stuffy label , ' A factor to be reckoned with in motion pictures , " ' said one studio executive . " But her ego lags so far behind her box-office appeal you 'd think she suffers from an inferiority complex . " A famed Hollywood pest camps outside of the Brown Derby and Los Angeles preview houses armed with an ancient camera that rattles when shaken like a battered dollar watch . Most of the stars have learned to give him a fast brush-off , but Allyson is still obedient to his whims . When he tells her , " Turn your head , smile a little , moisten your lips , " she does just that . If one of his flash bulbs fails to go off , she holds the pose while he inserts another bulb and tries again . To Movie Maker Joe Pasternak , who directed her panicky steps through her first film , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives next door to everybody . " To Norman Panama , of the writer-director-producer team which made her film , The Reformer and the Redhead , " She 's not exactly beautiful , but she has more natural talent than any actress I know . Our only problem was to uncute her . But she 's a good trouper when it comes to co-operating . All we had to say to her was ' Junie ! ' in a warning tone . She 'd ask , ' Too cute ? ' and we 'd say , ' Yep , too cute . ' Then she 'd say , ' Okay , ' and wipe off the twinkling and nose wrinkling that naturally seem to ooze out of her . She came through honest , warm-hearted and unaffected on the scr , 2en . " In certain of the movie industry 's higher echelons , key men are loath to leave a lunch table in an executives ' dining room for fear that their best friends will snatch their jobs from them while they are gone . In such an atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allyson is " a smart cooky whose baby act comes in handy " ; " a butterfly with a lady fox 's mind . " But even in Hollywood 's intramural circles this sour opinion is a minority report . " What they really mean , " suggested Allyson 's friend , Claudette Colbert , " is that June is the complete female . In a world where the cards have been stacked against women ever since Eve found herself living too far from the nearest supermarket , men like to think that it is unethical for a cute little trick to have anything between her ears except fuzz . " Although it will come as news to most of her fans who have never been given a chance to believe differently , there is definitely nothing immature about Allyson 's body . Her fellow employee , Swimming Star Esther Williams , calls her " a girl who has less reason than almost anyone I know to insist that her bathing suits come with built-in Peter Pan collars . " In a town where talent is often another name for bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own with the most opulent cutie whose knowledge of histrionic art begins and ends with filling a sweater . One studio employee who had seen June scores of times without experiencing the slightest impulse to emit a low , sibilant whistle , happened to drop into Metro 's wardrobe department one day . There he saw the dress forms that reproduce M-G-M ' s female stars ' proportions so they can be used for fittings when the stars are not available . Each form bears a star 's name . The visitor stood before the one labeled Allyson , studying its curves and shaking his head unbelievingly . He muttered , " No , no . It ca n't be true . " His surprise was a direct result of Allyson 's refusal to merchandise Hollywood 's No. 1 product  --  sex . The only photographs of June ever taken that might be labeled cheesecake are the swimsuit and sunbathing ones shot of her by her husband , whose hobby is photography . Nor do all of these do her " shape " justice , since even girls Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will emphasize their charms to qualify as whistle bait . Her modesty very nearly approaches a fixation . One day an M-G-M director received a frantic SOS from Wardrobe . " They had got themselves an emergency over there and they needed me to straighten it out , " he said , in telling me the story . " It seems that there 's a scene in a picture I 'm making that calls for Junie to peel some of her clothes . Her chin is wobbling and she is very close to tears . The only men who would see her undressed are the electricians , and they 've already seen so many actresses in a lot less that they look at ' em like doctors . " ' I 've never worn just a slip in front of any man except my husband , ' she Hays . I reason with her . I say , ' Listen , June , dear , this scene runs for two and a half pages , and without you in a slip we ca n't do it . ' Finally I wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene she 's pinned extra lace on the bottom of the garment and there 's more lace up around her neck . We almost have to give her an anesthetic to cut that lace off . " She 's a very funny kid about her shape , " he continued with a puzzled air . " One day I tell her , ' Junie , baby , you 've got a very hot figure there . ' She changes the subject quickly . Later she tells a pal of mine , ' I guess he told me that because he thought I 'd take it as a compliment ' The woman employed by her studio to accompany Allyson on her personal-appearance tours and act as a buffer between the star and the press , said , " I 've known her longer and better than anybody in this town . Yet when I share a bedroom with her she says , ' Hey , turn your back . I 'm going to change . ' " There is , however , nothing shy about Allyson 's contacts with her studio 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks is " right " for her , the producer and director who are to make the picture become aware that they are seeing more of Allyson than they ordinarily do . " I 'm walking around the lot and I find myself bumping into her , " said Joe Pasternak . " If I go into the corninisi4ary , she sits down beside me . It gets so I would n't be surprised to see her lathered up under a towel in the next chair when I go into the barbershop . The next thing I know , I not only have her elbow in my ribs in the commissary , I 've also got her on my mind , which is the reason why , when I 'm casting Two Girls and a Sailor , all of a sudden I get an inspiration . I ask myself , ' Why do n't I put June in it too ? ' " A few years later , when he was planning a film called Music for Millions , Pasternak again began to see quite a lot of June . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' picture , but June twinkled her eyes at Pasternak determinedly and asked wistfully , " Are you sure the other girl 's going to play it ? " When Pasternak said firmly , " Look , we need a girl who looks older than two and a half years for the part , " June refused to be discouraged . " Well . . . in case you change your mind ? " she said . Once more her persistence paid off . One day Pasternak called her and asked , " How are you feeling ' ? " " I 'm sick , " she said . " I 've got a cold in my dose . " " Sorry , " he told her . " I wanted you for Music for Millions . " " She yelled at me over the phone , ' Wait , I 'm not sick any more ! ' " Pasternak said . And the next morning before they 'd opened the front gate , she was at the studio with her nose still running . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she makes you feel like a guy who should be taken in hand by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . Tears come into her eyes , and in the end you find yourself apologizing for being a Simon Legree and-you rush out to fix things up so the studio wo n't suspend her , but will keep right on paying her for doing nothing . " You ca n't remember exactly what she 's said in one of those sessions , " Pasternak said , " but after they 're over you 're sure of one thing : You 've not only agreed , you 've even insisted that she have her own way . " The girl who can take care of herself so adequately by being " a complete female " can , nevertheless , be chuckleheadedly impractical when matters involving large sums of money are concerned . For days she wandered about her home wearing a preoccupied look on her face and muttering , " Gee , I ought to be getting more dough . " One day she came home , beaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solid ten-year contract . " " How much ? " Powell inquired . " She got a funny look on her face , " Powell said , in describing the conversation . " Then she said in a very small voice , ' I forgot to ask . ' " There are two schools of thought concerning the story of Allyson 's life as told by Allyson herself . One school  --  the sympathetic one  --  puts it this way : " She gets so carried away by her interviews that she dramatizes herself . Many of her ideas are pixilated ones and you ca n't always believe what she says . The way she wants things to be is the way she believes they are . " The other , harsher school accuses her of " having the kind of imagination that runs through a story of her life barefoot . Maybe it 's just impishness or maybe she gets bbred with telling it , but it 's never alike twice . " Both Allyson and her husband deny that she spikes the facts of her life with fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that when she tells the truth it adds up to such a corny tear jerker that nobody believes it . " " Listen , " June said , " and you 'll see what Richard means . I was born under the Third Avenue El . I went to New
