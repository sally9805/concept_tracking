Talk of atomic power for peaceful purposes is usually treated only as a hope for the distant , peaceful future . At last week 's Chicago meeting of the American Chemical Society , Atomic Energy Commissioner Eugene M. Zuckert had better news . Said Zuckert : " Scientists had thought of atomic power as being economically practical ten or 15 years hence . We suddenly find that power from atomic energy seems closer at hand . . . Even in the six months I have been with the commission there is a noticeable quickening of interest in atomic energy . " <P> Most estimates of the cost of atomic power , said Zuckert , have been based on the amount of plutonium that is produced , along with energy , when Uranium-235 is " burned " in a reactor . The operation can be made profitable for a power company if the Government will buy the plutonium at a high enough price and stockpile it for atomic weapons . Now , said Zuckert , " we may hit upon the development of power at competitive cost from non-plutonium-producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making are so great that ' power only ' reactors may be nearer than we dare hope for . " <P> Core &; Blanket . Zuckert did not explain what he meant by a " power only " reactor , but in the current issue of Nucleonics , Dr. W. H. Zinn , director of the AEC 's Argonne National Laboratory , described the experimental " breeder " reactor built and operated by the University of Chicago at Arco , Idaho . It produces " power only " by burning its own byproduct , plutonium . <P> The active core of the Arco breeder is about the size of a football . It is made of " enriched uranium , " i.e. , uranium rich in fissionable 11-235 . Around the core is a " fertile blanket " of 11-238 , the spent metal that remains when U-235 is extracted from natural uranium to make atom bombs . Through both blanket and core circulates a sodium-potassium alloy that is liquid at ordinary temperatures . This coolant carries away the heat of the nuclear reaction . The fluid metal leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate 250 kw of power . <P> More important is what happens in the blanket of U-238 . The fissioning U-235 in the core sends out a dense flux of highspeed neutrons . They are absorbed by the blanket , turning some of its U-238 into plutonium . Since this is also fissionable , it can be extracted chemically and used as fuel in the heat-giving core . <P> Burning Plutonium . The purpose of the Arco breeder is to " breed " more plutonium than is needed to replace the U-235 that it consumes . Dr. Zinn did not say so directly , but his and Commissioner Zuckert 's optimism suggests that it can be done . If so , the " power only " reactors of the future can burn all of their uranium , not merely the .7% that is naturally fissionable . There will be no need for the Government to buy their plutonium ; it will be burned too . If uranium gets scarce , the " fertile blanket " can be made of thorium , which neutrons turn into fissionable U-233-Dr . Zinn did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if it cost $35 a Ib. ( probably a generous figure ) , the fuel cost of the power produced from it would be only .0013 a kilowatt-hour . The fuel cost of electricity from coal is about .35 a kilowatt-hour-nearly 300 times as much .
