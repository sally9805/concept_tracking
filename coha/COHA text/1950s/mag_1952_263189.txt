When a movie star is billed as having " it " or " oomph , " what she probably has is heterosis ( hybrid vigor ) . At least , that is what Geneticist George D. Snell says . In the current Quarterly Review of Biology , Snell assembles evidence to show that superior qualities in humans , including physical attractiveness , are often due to heterosis , resulting from the crossing of two strains . <P> Dr. Snell describes heterosis in the case of swine ( Hampshires crossed with Duroc Jerseys produced superior pigs ) . Since he can not repeat the same experiment with people , he sifts a great mass of records to look for self-propelled experiments in human hybridization . <P> One of the most successful was made by the famous mutineers from the British warship Bounty , who settled down on Pitcairn Island in 1790 with some Tahitian women . The offspring of six mutineers and about a dozen women were examined in 1825 and found to be notably taller than either Englishmen or Tahitians . Some of them were strong enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 9.1 children per family in the third generation ) that they soon overcrowded the island . Other isolated racial crossings ( which were not adversely affected by social disapproval ) turned out almost as well . <P> England experienced another kind of hybridization . During the Middle Ages , small groups of peasants kept to themselves in isolated villages . Some were racially distinct ; others became distinct because of inbreeding . During the 16th century these enclaves broke up . The mingling of blood , says Dr. Snell , may have produced the outburst of talent and energy that characterized the Elizabethan Age . <P> The U.S. is well known for hybridization . Dr. Snell lists many prominent Americans as being the offspring of crossed strains-e.g. , Henry Ford was English-Dutch ; Alexander Hamilton was Scottish-French ; Theodore Roosevelt was **29;10513;TOOLONG . Lists of famous Americans show a high proportion of mixed ancestry . <P> Dr. Snell believes that the U.S. has not yet felt the full benefit of heterosis .
