A Story by Harold Brodkey Drawings by Bob Pinkwater The sound of Moorish laughter A CROSS the street from my house was a Catholic church . It was really a parochial school , rather drab and old , built of dried-bloodcolor brick with white trim ; but inside , it had a chapel , and every Sunday , cars filled our quiet suburban street , bells rang  --  small , almost shrill bells  --  and women dressed in stiff little hats and gloves stood and talked on the school steps . The school was sort of an eyesore in our neighborhood , which had been built , somewhat hopefully , in the closing years of the ' twenties and which consisted of a number of small one-family houses . My mother did n't like living so close to a parochial school and quondam church , because of the noise and traffic on Sundays and the lack of privacy . Also , our street , Courtney Avenue , had been designed to have a parkway running down its middle , like a boulevard , but the church had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( my father was dead ) had bought our house thinking there was going to be a parkway in front of it , and she was sullen about the church and the nuns and the brisk , athletic priest that ran it . During the week when the church was a school , the noise was almost worse . Children played in the yard of the school ( that yard was a shame , my mother always said ; it had hardly any grass ; and its seesaws and jungle-gym and swings were old and unsightly ) and sometimes they chased their balls right up to our front steps and trampled my mother 's flower borders . Sometimes too the nuns would raise their voices or a child would cry and the noise , disquieting and alien , would upset my mother and fill my grandmother with rage . My grandmother was seventy-eight years old ; she was fierce and unreconciled ; she despised most of her seven children and so far as I could tell liked only two of her fourteen grandchildren , both pretty girls . My grandmother did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide behind her age , and she fought me man to man with a kind of virulent hatred that was almost as good as affection . She used to pinch me and give me sandwiches for lunch that I did n't like  --  r hated baloney , for instance , but boloney I had four days out of five . But then on the other hand , when I called her names or talked back to her she never told on me . She merely shook one bony finger and warned me that I 'd come to no good end and that she 'd get even . Anyway , grandmother hated the church . She had left Russia shortly after the 1888 pogrom in Odessa , and while she never spoke specifically of the horrors she had undergone , she sometimes would speak of how awful it had been , " with the priests leading the mob , flying their banners , and mocking at the poor dying Jews . " I did n't believe her . She was a dreadful liar . The priest across the street was very young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would see him with his gown tucked in , playing ball with some of the older boys of his school . The priest was dark-haired and rosy-lipped ; after a few minutes of baseball , he would grow flushed and excited , and he would shout as loudly as any of the boys . Sometimes he would dance around the sidelines when his side got a hit or worked a man around into scoring position . Usually the opposing team was totally disheartened by all this ; they seemed to feel they were playing against the blessed side . Sometimes , though , they 'd set their faces , accept a league with the devil , and play with a kind of wild intensity  --  usually this was after considerable goading from the priest  --  and their air of defiance was enormous and moving . At times , my mother would send me to the store and I would cut across the parochial school 's playground to a Kroger 's grocery store on the corner of Peabody and Corcoran . I would dawdle on the path watching the baseball game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest 's relationship to the boys , something powerful and paternal and unquestioned . I wondered what it was in the priest that made the boys so docile , And often , I heard the boys call him Father . One day , our neighborhood was in an uproar . My mother came home from her office early , and she and our neighbors and I stood on our front steps and watched workmen finish putting up a six-foot-high wire-mesh fence around the school 's playground . Inside the mesh was a steam shovel . " By God , they 're going to put up a church , " my mother said . " This is the end of the block . " Mr. Morgan , who lived on the corner , said he thought it might be a parking lot for the present chapel ; perhaps the city had forced them to stop using the street . " Goodness knows , " he said , " We 've all complained often enough to the city manager . " My mother said she hoped Mr. Morgan was right but she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her window was stiff with rage when 1 went inside . " They 'll be outburning our houses next , " she said darkly . " Do n't be stupid , Grandma , " I said , purposefully shoving her rocking chair a little , " There 's a law against that . " " Who wants a cross hanging over their house all day long ? " my grandmother said , but she was only talking , making noise because she was lonely : she had outlived everybody she cared about : and she was surprised still , after fifty years in this country , that things were so comparatively peaceful and uninteresting . I N THE cold weather , I used to wear a bright red lumber jacket an older cousin had passed on to me . It was made out of a Hudson Bay blanket or out of the same material , and since I was particularly subject to colds and it was the warmest coat I had ever had , I wore it every clay . It was an object of envy and mockery to my classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely fascinated . They used to crowd to their fence and watch me walk by . Sometimes they created incidents . One afternoon , coming- home from school , I was waylaid by five or six of the parochial school boys . They jumped out of the bushes at the end of the block and surrounded me . I raised my book  --  I was carrying a large geography book  --  over my head and began to curse them . My blasphemy so startled them , they gave way and I ran down the street and got safely home . But these incidents did n't happen often . Once , on a cold , late November evening , I sat idly on one of the swings in the parochial school 's yard . The foundation for the church had been dug and covered over already for the winter . I was swinging with my eyes half-closed , trying to imagine the piles of dirt around the foundation were mountains . I had never seen mountains . Two boys from the school were playing desultorily at the other end of the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawing in and a cold wind nipped and twisted The Father came out of the school and walked down to inspect the foundation ; on the way back , my red jacket caught his eye  --  it was a very bright red  --  and he came over and asked me who I was . I told him , shyly , that I lived across the street ; I asked him if he was building a big church . He was even handsomer up close than from a distance : he had a cleft in his chin and a perfect shave ; he had sad dark eyes with thick lashes ; his mouth haul a curiously lonely expression as if he had never quite gotten used to his responsibilities or to the quality of life in our lonely suburb . He said , amiably enough , that it was going to be a medium-sized church . He felt my jacket and said , " That 's quite a coat you have there . " " It 's the warmest coat in the world , " I burst out . The Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to fall in love with him . I took to waiting on our front steps in the cold December afternoons and when the priest came out of his school , I 'd smile and wave at him . Then I would go and hide in the basement . I was n't capable of bearing two waves in one afternoon . Later , I hid in the attic , away from my grandmother , and stared out the dusty window at the school . I kept my passion an absolute secret . But I could not resist asking my mother one evening what she would do if a Father talked to her ; I had to be prepared . " Be polite , " she said . " Why ? Has the priest across the street been after you ? " She looked at me sharply . " No , no , " I cried . " But if he had , would it be wrong ? " " Well , he would try to convert you , " my mother said . She was watching me very closely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch . " W H E N spring came , I built a tree house in the maple that hung over our driveway . I could sit in the tree house and watch the school across the street . Often the priest came out and inspected the work the men were doing on the church . He beamed at them  --  which was a good thing ; but often , he gave orders  --  which was not such a good thing ; but he never saw me which was the best thing of all . Without having the Father to think about , that would have been a terrible year for me . My best friend , Harry Bucker , had moved to California , and I had no other close friends . The other boys who were left were a dull crew . Listlessly I played war games ; I patiently sat through games of torture , even though Johnny Parsons had once tied me to a chair and burned my sweater with a heated soldering iron and my mother had blamed me . I was bored . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I liked to win ; I only played with boys I could beat . Over the years I won more than three hundred marbles . I kept count . When I played cops and robbers , those of us who were shot had to lie down and wait to be buried before they could get up and join the game again . " You ca n't leave bodies all over the lawn , " I 'd argue disgustedly ; " it brings the plague . " In the middle of a conversation I might yank a toy plane out of my pocket and bomb my companion . If he did n't immediately fall shrieking to the ground , I would n't play with him again . I would fall to the ground , if I was bombed , and it was bad for my health . That left the Father , and he was my delight for almost six months . I even used to hover by the wire-mesh fence when he was playing base-ball with his boys . I would hang on the fence with one hand and sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I 'd go away . The church was rising by leaps and bounds . My mother thought it was hideous . I liked it . It was a big building of gray stone with a high tower on which there was going to be a concrete statue of Jesus . The facade of the church was covered with a scaffolding , and I used to play on that with some of the other boys in the neighborhood . We climbed , daring each other , all the way to the top of the tower . We ran up and down the ramps where the workmen wheeled barrows of mortar . We played tag on all fours on the half-finished roof . One day when 1 was alone on the scaffolding  --  it was a Saturday , a warm sunny day , in June  --  the priest came to look at his building . He saw me perched up near the tower as a matter of fact I was looking at the statue of Jesus which lay in the blocks on the roof ) and called to me to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture me on how dangerous that was and that I must never do it again or he would tell my parents . 1 got tears in my eyes . Then suddenly , he saw them , smiled , rather embarrassedly , and asked me it I liked his church . He wanted to console inc for his bawling out . I said it was beautiful . He asked me if I wanted to see the inside . I said I did . He took my hand , while my heart palpitated , and led me into the church . It was actually the first church I had ever been in . Shadows hung along the walls as thick as curtains . The pews gleamed newly ; I thought the confessional booths were marvelous . I thought they were where shy women sat so they would n't be seen . The interior was mostly completed . There was a small lobby and then doors and then a little vestibule marked off from the main part of the church by fluted concrete columns . " We 'll replace those with marble ones some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit of striding forward , while I ran to keep up , then stopping suddenly , dropping his head to look at me , firing his sentences , and then striding on . He reminded me a good deal of my mother when she was being businesslike , except that he was holding my hand , and his voice would occasionally slip into a booming theatrical register that made rue feel as if I were hanging on in a high wind . With two more athletic strides  --  closer to leaps really  --  he had me next to the water basin . " Holy water , " he barked . " The basin 's Italian marble , real Italian marble . " " I think that 's wonderful , " I whispered shyly . " Acanthus leaves , " he said pointing to a carved frieze that rah around the edge . " Grapes . Pitchers of milk and honey . " I sighed admiringly , as I had heard my mother do when seeing a friend 's new house . " They took very expensive . " The priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " You like such things ? " he asked tersely . " Yes , sir . " I could tell that he was very lonely . The look on his face was a mixture of hope , and of the wariness that had come from a number of rebuffs in the past . He sat down in a pew and pulled me down next to him . He told me that I should n't call him sir , I should call him Father . This seemed nearly blasphemy to me , a terrible and wicked pleasure , that I ought to avoid . I told him I did n't believe in him ; did calling him Father mean that I believed ? He explained to me the hierarchy of the church , dwelling with a kind of loving eagerness on the titles of monsignor and bishop , archbishop and cardinal . When he went on to try to explain what such titles meant , his face grew flushed , and his voice stumbled searching for terms of sufficient glory to describe them . He even stammered a little in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me , as he studied me with his extraordinarily young and vivacious eyes , how old I was and if I prayed at night and if I liked school . It seemed to me he was growing to like me and I became uneasy . I decided to warn him now , rather than have him learn it later when it would hurt me more . " I 'm a difficult child , " I blurted out . The priest 's eyes kindled . " Well , I guessed that , " he murmured . " I can sce you 're a regular Tartar . But it 's quite all right with me . " Originally , of course , the priest had only meant to be kind . He had started to bawl me out and I had nearly cried , and his gentleness had led him  --  his gentleness and his embarrassment  --  to show me the church , to distract me , and that , by showing me what he took such pride in . But I had seen the church and showed no signs of wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened eyes ; it was adoration , almost , but he could n't guess that . He thought perhaps it might be religion . He asked me , " Do you believe in God ? " " Oh yes , sir  --  Father . " " Do you know who Jesus was ? " " Yes , Father . " " Who ? " " The man who preached and started the Cath-olics . " " He was n't a man , child . He was the Son of God . " " Oh , I do n't believe that , " I cried . The priest sat there , perplexed . He could n't quite comprehend then what 1 wanted ; but at last a light grew in his eyes . " It 's architecture you 're interested in ? " he asked me joyfully . I did n't know quite what he was talking about , but I said yes . " Would you like to see my treasures ? " " Oh , yes , Father . " " I have n't shown them to many people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the back of the church . " I am said to have a problem with spiritual pride . " He shook his head briskly . " But it simply is n't true . I believe that worship should be grand , do n't you ? " Then he recollected who I was and smiled at himself . " Of course , you do n't even know what spiritual pride is , " he cried exultantly . " And now just look at that stained glass window ! French . It 's French . Have you ever seen such a crimson ? Or such a blue ? " His voice dropped to a whisper . ' ' It 's St. Thomas . And that one , " raising his voice , " is St. George slaying the dragon . " " They 're grand , they 're grand , " I said eagerly . " And now to the storeroom ! " the Father cried , in the voice with which he shouted at baseball games . We flew down a short curving corridor , the Father 's cassock whipping against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key and unlocked a door , switched on an overhead light , and released my hand . " There ! " he cried . All around the room were objects of gold and silver , some half in boxes , others standing on boxes with shreds of excelsior hanging to them , sticking in their filigree . " These are for the church , " the Father said briskly . " They were inordinately expensive . . . . " His breath escaped in a long sigh . " Mortgages , mortgages , " he murmured . Around the walls were tacked blueprints , not ordinary blue and white blue-prints , but ones of black lines on heavy white paper and under each sheet were small ink drawings of facades and altars and interiors , of doors and stained glass windows , even of pews and the water spout . I knew with sudden clairvoyance that the Father had drawn the pictures . I asked him and he nodded . " However , I was not allowed to build that church ! " he said with some bitterness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and among a pile of bills and receipts brought out an architect 's drawing of a facade . It was high and narrow . " I do n't suppose it matters what kind of house you build to worship God in , " the priest said with heavy sarcasm , his voice theatrical and pulsing , " but this suburb is ugly enough without planning on its turning into slum fifty years from now . " A chill ran up my back , a sensation of a malevolent world watching me . Slum ? In fifty years ? My home ? What would happen to me ? The Father was saying , " After all , I raised the money . . . " He sat on one of the packing cases and put his head in his hands . I realized that something had gone wrong . I said nothing . I blinked and then I walked around the room and saw a statue of a woman holding an infant . The statue was painted , and it was larger than 1 was . " Who 's this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his hands in front of the lower part of his face ; it was a curiously childlike gesture , though theatrical with his raised black eyebrows and piercing eyes staring over the tips of his fingers . " The Virgin and the Infant Jesus . " He kept his hands raised , as if he feared he was going to be laughed at . " Do you like it ? " " Yes , " I said , enthusiastically . " It 's Italian . " He rose and came over . " Genuine Italian work . Have you ever seen such a blue ? " The Virgin had a blue cape . " Now , look closely . Do you see the tiny silver stars inlaid in the wood ? Have you ever seen anything like that ? " He was growing brighter by the minute . " It 's going to stand in a little chapel under a blue window . Wo n't that be wonderful with those stars ? And come look at this censer , it 's true Spanish work , from Mexico . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpacked yet . In another hundred years , these will all be treasures . And come see the altar screen . It 's gold-leafed . Here 's the flight from Egypt : Israelites , " he said , beaming at me , " just like you . And there 's the Sermon on the Mount . Is n't that fish border marvelous ? " The fish spilled in golden profusion , sporting delicate , nearly transparent fins , out of a cornucopia that Jesus held above his head ; on the cornucopia was engraved the word Charity . One fish twisted its head roguishly and bent adoring eyes on the figure of Jesus . I clapped my hands . " Yes , the fish are heavenly . Now , look at this chasuble . The Bishop gave me this three years ago when I first came , to encourage me in getting a church built . You see , it 's the garden of Eden . " I saw the trees and a naked man and woman and a serpent . " They 're naked , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not supposed to notice that at your age . And these are the cedar boards one of my parishioners gave me to make two closets in the rectory . " " Two , " I cried , " whatever for ? " " They keep moths out , " the Father said to me , " but it 's the smell that 's so glorious . Smell them . " He was right , the smell was glorious . I looked at him in delight . " Two ! " I cried . " Two ! " he murmured with mild modesty . N 01V , there was nothing left to look at . Silence descended . 1 stood with my head lowered , waiting patiently for the Father to begin the ritual grown-ups usually followed in getting rid of a child : he would ask me if it was n't my dinnertime . But the Father stood with his hands clasped behind his hack . The excitement had n't left his face . Slowly he opened his mouth . " Two thousand years of Christ , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed on the ceiling , " and we are still building churches that look like gymnasiums . It maddens me , maddens me . . . . For the Lord who died for us we will not build a decent tabernacle  --  if this is spiritual pride , I will gladly take my penance . Gladly ! " he roared and took a quick look at me , a little surprised , probably , at how small I was . " I 'm not a Catholic , sir , " I said weakly . " I know , child . But who would want to be and worship in a gray warehouse across the street ? If you only knew how beautiful churches can be ! I suppose you 've never seen Milan . Milan , " he sighed , " is nearly blasphemous . And Notre Dame ? Notre Dame may be a little heavy and over-logical , but it has spirit , esprit , soul . . Chartres , I do n't even mention . I wo n't discuss Chartres . Chartres is a miracle , This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be in St. Louis ? No , I do n't mention Chartres . " Idly I took three pieces of excelsior and tried to braid them . " God is beautiful , " the Father said . " His churches should be beautiful . " " Father , if you want a nicer church , why do n't you build one ? Who would stop you ? Why do you let people boss you around ? " " Stop me ? Let them ? " He smiled ; his eyebrows shot up ; but then his face melted back , and he looked saddened and defeated . " Let my Bishop boss me . . . that 's quite a novel thought , a charming thought . . . " His voice trailed off . S I R , " I said in a low voice . " I 'm very sorry if I said something wrong . . . . " The priest looked at me ; our glances met on a sharp incline ; and it was one of those moments , when an emotion stands clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two strangers . The priest gave an audible gasp . He had not even imagined what my feelings were or thought to wonder why he talked so freely to me . But at that moment , he realized everything . Re had responded to the presence of love : He had warmed himself in it , even though it came from a tenyear-old child . In a spasm of embarrassment , he began to cough ; he covered his mouth and coughed for several minutes , while I stood there nervously . " My father 's dead , " I said , at last ; I felt I had to explain . The priest could not help smiling , not because of any pleasure he felt , but because it was the only gesture he could allow himself . The smile played about his lips as if it were a small bird . " 1 have to go home , " I said , miserable with shyness , " it 's my dinnertime . " " Ah , " the priest murmured . He stood up in a sudden flutter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit me again .. . . " " I ? " I began ; I was trembling a little . " I 'd have . ? . I 'd have to sneak in . . . . " I was sorry now the priest had guessed my secret , that he had to consider what was possible and what was not . . . . It was humiliating , and I felt the dim stirring of anger . MAGAZINE " Perhaps , " the priest murmured , " I might talk to your mother and explain ? " But I was shaking my head violently , and he paused . His eyes glittered . I think the love 1 felt for him must have seemed attractive ; in every man there must exist somewhere the urge to be a father , or to play at it for a little while . . . He gazed at me , probably wondering at himself for having such feelings . " You have a high sense of loyalty , " he said at last , a faint shade of rebuke in his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nodded . " I 've enjoyed your visit very much , " the priest said and held out his hand ; he had lapsed into sheerly masculine dignity . I thanked him for showing me the church . " I appreciate it very much . It was very kind of you . " " Kind ? " he said ; he raised his arms , perplexed . " I try to be . child . . . I try to be . " The whole episode , so much of it taking place in gesture , so embarrassing and odd , had lasted only a Few minutes . When I left the priest , he was standing in the middle of the storeroom , pulling idly at his ear . I was furious with myself for giving everything away . I ran out the back door and then turned and gave it a kick ; then I ran around the block and down Courtney Avenue to my house . T H E clear June day was ending with a tumultuous sunset . An extraordinary effulgence of light blistered gold streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamers of lavender and crimson The dazzling light flowed down Courtney street , gleamed along the docile fronts of the modest houses and set a pinkish flush on the gray stone of the uncompleted church . Now , the street was a river of light ; now , the clouds began to plunge into the gap in the western sky . I was n't old enough to have heard , faint in the distance , the sound of laughter from within the courtyards of Islam , among pierced walls and blossoming almond trees , where philosophers know there is no God but Allah . That June day , as the sun set , I stood on the front steps of my house and gazed wonderingly at the parochial school . I heard my grandmother fling open her window ( she hated fresh air ) and stick her angry head out into the cool Hush of evening : " What are you standing there for ? You want to catch your death of cold ? You want the Catholics to think you 're admiring their church ? You come inside . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my cars , my tongue out , nose wrinkled . I wonder if the Father saw me . At any rate , my grandmother slammed the window down and I ran inside to do battle with her .
