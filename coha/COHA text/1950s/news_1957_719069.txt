txt President Eisenhower is doing just what a lot of people have urged him to do ? in the foreign aid bill fight  --  and Congress is balking like a mule at the vigorous leadership . The House Appropriations Committee slashed $809,650,000 from foreign aid funds Aug. 15 just as President Eisenhower made a new plea  --  his third this week  --  for more money , the Associated Press reported . A White House statement said Mr. Eisenhower , " in the conviction that the national interests of this country are deeply involved , " hopes the cut will be restored . In less than an hour after the presidential statement the full committee stamped approval on earlier subcommittee action . However , the committee apparently acted without knowledge of the presidential action . Representative Richard B. Wigglesworth ( R ) of Massachusetts said no letter or communication was received from the White House . Pressure re Applied Mr. Eisenhower . is applying White House pressure to Congress , calling a sudden news conference , talking up the vital necessity of the mutual security program , and threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House persists in its slashing tactics . And Congress , which has n't heard a whip crack at the White House for some time , is putting on a pose of aggrieved surprise . At least the Democratic leadership is ; it ca n't remember anything like this unless it harks way back  --  to Harry S. Truman . The House appropriations subcommittee 's reaction to the foreign aid bill and the President 's new burst of leadership is a piece of stark defiance . Mr. Eisenhower originally asked for $4,400,000,000 in mutual security ( foreign aid ) funds in his January budget . He voluntarily reduced this to $3,860,000,000 when Congress protested . A Senate-House compromise authorized $3,367,000,000 , Slashed by Committee But now comes the business of actually appropriating the money . Congress , with antiquated procedure , tackles all measures four limes  --  authorizations in Senate and House , then appropriations in Senate and House . And the House appropriations subcommittee has just approved a foreign aid program cut way down to $2,524 , - 760,000 . This action came only a few hours after Mr. Eisenhower had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would summon the lawmaket 's back to Washington in a special sesssion this fall if they failed to vote enough funds to protect the nation 's peace and security via the foreign aid program . The economy-minded subcommittee , meeting behind closed doors , slashed an additional 350 milliOn dollars from the military aid requests , 165 million dollars more from defense support aid , and 200 million dollars from the President 's development loan plan . And the subcommittee further deleted seven million dollars that the President had requested for his atoms for peace program . Impromptu Conference The subcommittee 's figures could be upped when the bill reaches the full committee , and more especially when it goes to the House floor for final House approval . But it appeared that the final figure would be substantially below the President 's minimum request . Aware of the House mood , the President had summoned an impromptu press session late on August 14 and praised the for- I eign aid program as " one of the most successful of any in which we have been engaged . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose and strength throughout the free world . " The President said foreign aid expenditures are " the cheapest money we spend " in obtaining military security and said he did not believe Americans wanted to see the aid program " crumble through any false economy . " The President said he could accept the $3,367,000,000 authorized in joint . Senate-House conference , and that , if this sum were appropriated , a summoning of Congress in extra session in November would.not be necessary . He said he would , however , " watch every single day what is developing in the world and whenever , for lack of money , the United States interests become placed in real jeopardy , at that moment I would have no recourse except to call a special session . " Democratic Strategy Quite evidently , House members believe there is strong opposition lb the foreign aid pro- ! gram among constituents back home . And there is the desire among the Democratic ' opposition , in Senate as well as House , to make a record of " responsible reduction " in the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratic strategy to resist all displays of vigorous leadership at the White House lest the impression get about that Mr. Eisenhower is , after all , a President exhibiting vigorous and effective leadership . Politics plays its part on foreign aid , as it does in the civil rights fight . Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , Democratic Senate leader , set the tone of Democratic comment when he got up to express his doubt that any senators would allow their votes to be influenced by an apprehension that they would be called back to Washington in November . Senator Johnson was one of the Congress leaders called to a recent meeting at the White House , at which the President urged that Congress support the foreign aid bill at the $3,367,000,000 figure , Independent Support Senator Johnson said the Eisenhower administration had not properly supported its foreign aid requests . Representative Otto E. Passman ( D ) of Louisiana , chairman of the subcommittee , echoed the same theme , declaring that if he had a group of advisers that provided no more facts on foreign aid than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " I Actually , Mr. Eisenhower 's recommendations are supported by virtually every independent study which has been made of the aid program during the past year  --  studies made by the Benjami n Fairless Committee , by the International Development Advisory Board headed by Eric Johnston , by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for International Studies , and by three special committees for whose nonpartisan advice the Senate itself appropriated $300 , - 000 , Picture : Page 3
