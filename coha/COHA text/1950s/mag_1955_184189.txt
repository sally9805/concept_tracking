Columnist Bill Gold , of the Washington Post and Times Herald , recently reported that he had discovered an unusual system of reading TIME which is used by Charles E. Randall of McLean , Va. : <P> ONE of the many periodicals Charlie reads is TIME . . . Charlie is practically a charter subscriber and has been a devoted reader for many years . Unfortunately , however , he has difficulty keeping current . There are too many things to read , and not enough hours in the day . . . When a new issue of TIME arrives , he does n't even crack it open for a peek . No sir . He just puts it in its proper place with the other unread issues that have piled up . and keeps right on plodding along with the copy he was engrossed in at the moment . In short , he 's going to read his TIME chronologically , or not at all . <P> Currently , Charlie has a closet full of issues that he has n't caught up with yet . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learns that Allied forces are making a daring thrust for Paris . Hitler , at this point , is in a fury over the plot to assassinate him , and has begun a purge of top-rank Nazis . <P> Charlie no doubt wonders how all this is going to turn out . Little does he know that in the next issue the Allies will land in the south of France to launch a pincer movement against the retreating Germans . . . My advice to Charlie is to take heart . I predict that by the end of the month we 'll be in complete control of Paris , Marseille will capitulate . Bulgaria will petition for an armistice , and Rumania will surrender and switch to the Allied side . As Verdun . Saint-Mihiel and Dieppe fall , the Russians will take over the entire Ploesti oilfields . <P> Here at home , the War Production Board will erupt as Charles E. ( Electric Charlie ) Wilson and Donald M. Nelson bring their long-standing feud to a head . And Sidney J. Weinberg , WPB vice-chairman assigned to the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust . Charlie will be pleased to know that Governor Thomas E. Dewey will conduct a stirring campaign as the Republican nominee for President . <P> <P> Randall might also be interested to know that on Aug. 16 , TIME took a full-page ad in the Washington Post to advertise a statement by Leon Henderson : " Cut down on corporation taxes after the war ? " asked Leon . " I 'd cut ' em out . " <P> But I 'm not going to be a killjoy and spoil your reading , Subscriber Randall . You just go right ahead with what you were doing . And if you come across any clues as to what happened to that " lasting peace " we were working on during ' 44 , please let me hear from you at once . <P> According to Columnist Gold , TIME Reader Randall did get in touch with him a few days later , not to report discovery of the " lasting peace , " but to say that after the column appeared , so many of his friends had kidded him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current issue . His reaction : What a wonderful preview of the future ! <P> <P> Cordially yours ,
