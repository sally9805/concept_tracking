The New Dealing anti-Communist New York Post and Manhattan 's Communist Daily Worker both seized happily on the Gallup poll this week to bolster their anti-MacArthur positions . The poll , they trumpeted , proved that while most of the U.S. ( 62% ) disapproved of MacArthur 's firing , Americans certainly did not buy Mac-Arthur 's policies of toughening the war against the Chinese Reds . They cited the fact that three out of every five who were interviewed , according to Gallup , thought that the U.S. should try harder to make peace with the Reds . <P> " It seems perfectly plain , " said the Post , " that in the immediate aftermath of the upheaval , MacArthur had more personal fans than the President . It is equally clear , however , that the course of action recommended by the general-and opposed by Mr. Truman-was rejected with even greater vehemence . " <P> But both papers had reached their conclusions by leaving out a key question in the same Gallup poll taken before Mac-Arthur 's congressional speech. * The pollsters had asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases do you think it would bring the war in Korea to an end ? " On this point 46% of the answers were " yes , " 40% " no " ( although 75% were against full-scale war with Red China ) . Despite the Post and Worker , the poll actually indicated that the majority of those who had given their opinion sided with MacArthur , not the Administration . <P> <P> * For news of a later Gallup poll , see NATIONAL AFFAIRS .
