The 31-year-old patient lay in an up-to-date operating room in Lima , Peru , surrounded by sterile gadgets and the paraphernalia of modern anesthesia . At hand , to forestall infection , were ultramodern antibiotics . Flanking the patient were two of Peru 's most distinguished surgeons , Drs . Francisco Grana Reyes and Esteban Rocca . But their instruments were bronze chisels and saws made of obsidian ( volcanic glass ) which were 2,000 years old when Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru . <P> Tightly wound around the patient 's head was a three-layer bandage tourniquet such as Inca and pre-Inca surgeons used . With bronze chisel and copper hammer , <P> Grana and Rocca cut a hole in the left side of the patient 's skull , and cleaned out a blood clot ( the result of an injury ) that had been pressing against his brain and had robbed him of the power of speech . They replaced the piece of skull and sewed up the scalp . The whole operation had taken 14 minutes . The ancient surgical instruments were sent back to the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , told him he could go back to his work as a cabinetmaker this week . <P> The Lima surgeons ' feat was no idle trick . For years they had studied ancient skulls , instruments and bandages , and had practiced using the museum relics in autopsies . After their first use on a live patient , Dr. Grana was delighted . The operation proved , he said , that the ancients ' tools and methods were as good as the moderns ' , and in some ways perhaps better . For the future , he foresaw wider use of the tourniquet bandage , which had given him an almost bloodless field of operation . And he thinks another pre-Inca wrinkle may prove useful : flexible bronze needles , which the surgeon can bend when putting in stitches .
