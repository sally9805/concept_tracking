In Rajputana in central India lies the high rock of Chitor . " The swell of its sides , " wrote Rudyard Kipling , " follows the form of a ship-from bow to stern more than three miles long and from three to five hundred feet high . " Four centuries ago , in the land battleship of Chitor , the Rajputs held out against the invading Moguls . The Rajputs wore armor and fought with spears ; the Moguls used cannon . In the last decisive engagement , a lucky Mogul shot killed the Rajput chieftain Jaimal , and the garrison , losing hope , performed the dreaded rite of jauhar , <P> The women and children were immolated on funeral pyres , and the warriors threw themselves on the Mogul swords . To complete his victory ( which consolidated the Moslem conquest of Hindustan ) , the Mogul Emperor Akbar massacred 30,000 Rajput retainers , but failed to arrest the flight of the Rajput 's famed armorers . With their families they followed their own Prince Pratap Singh into the forests , and took a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed until Chitor was reconquered . <P> The Long Vow . Abandoned , Chitor became a haunt of tigers , one of a thousand Hindu shrines , and today the only recurring evocation of its stirring last days is the curse which may sometimes be heard on Indian lips : " By the sin of the sack of Chitor . " The Rajput armorers became a tribe of wandering blacksmiths called the Gadia Lohars , big , fork-bearded men in pink turbans , women wearing silver bangles and big silver nose rings , and untouchables worshiping the smallpox goddess , Sheetala . Without quite knowing why , they still observe their ancient vow : never do they sleep under a roof , but live in carts , wherein children are born and the old die , in which their beds , or charpais , are always upside down . Instead of swords and spears , they make axes and sickles , but in recent years their ancient craft products , overwhelmed by a flood of cheap manufactured tools , have been less in demand . The Gadia Lohars have been facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by the Moguls . <P> Last week from all over India the Lohars converged on Chitor . In the great plain below the landship fortress , their 4,000 bullock carts were drawn up in huge circles like the covered wagons of American pioneers . Over their wagons flew tattered Rajput sun flags ( symbolizing the god Rama ) and banners reading , " Hail Emperor Nehru . " Few of the tribesmen had ever heard of Prime Minister Nehru , but they knew that a great badshah ( ruler ) had offered to succor them at Chitor , a place they had always avoided in their wanderings . <P> The Return . Riding in a jeep , Badshah Nehru led the Lohars up the steep winding road to one of the fort 's seven iron-spiked gateways , wide enough for two elephants to pass abreast . Here he ceremoniously applied the vermilion-tinted rice dust to the forehead of the leading Lohar , while the Indian flag was raised on a 120-ft. marble tower erected to commemorate a Rajput victory in the 15th century . " Brothers , come on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
