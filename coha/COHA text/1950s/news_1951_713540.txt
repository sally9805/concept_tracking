txt Massachusetts ' fund for payments to jobless workers has been reduced to the weakest position of any in the country , principally because . for years unemployment here has run higher than normal while the average taxes on employers have been lower than customary , according to findings of the Galenson report released today . The study , the last undertaken of the state system of unemployment insurance , was directed by Prof. Walter Galenson of the department of economics of Harvard University . It was initiated by Antonio England , ? director of the Division of Employment Security , and financed by a $25,000 appropriation from the United States Department of Labor . Professor Galenson termed the position of the state fund precarious when he finished his investigatiOn last August . But the sharp cut in unemployment since then , caused by the Korean war and defense production , has put the fund on a sounder basis for the present , it is noted by Mr. England . Guide for Legislation The report was designed as a guide to legislation to improve the state program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business recession . Professor Galenson himself , however , does not offer any recommendations , though several times coming close . " Fundamentally , the prime determinant of unemployment insurance cost is the level of unemployment , " says a 12-page digest of the report , which will be available from the printers in a few weeks . " Except for the war period , Massachusetts has been a state of relatively high unemployment , particularly within the last few years , and that is undoubtedly the major causal factor to which high costs are attributable . " Since 1943 , Massachusetts has not only exceeded the national average in terms of ratio of benefits to wages , but it has led every other state in this respect with the exception of Utah .... The greater costliness of the Massachusetts benefit structure since the war may be ascribed primarily to the relatively worse unemployment conditions that have prevailed in the commonwealth . " Tax Take Is Low Of the tax situation , the report declares that " the present low level of the state reserve the state fund out of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low average employer contribution rates that have been collected during each year since 1942 . " ? At the end of 1949 , the Massachusetts ratio of reserves to taxable wages was 3.33 per cent , compared with 8.9 per cent for the United States as a whole , Professor Galenson points out . The Massachusetts ratio , he adds , was by far the lowest in the country , almost 2 per cent below Rhode Island , the next lowest . Massachusetts continues today at the bottom . For the years 1942-49 inclusive , failure to maintain an average rate of contribution at the national average cost the Massachusetts fund about $100,000,000 , the report estimates . This , it comments , is " the measure of financial advantage enjoyed by the Massachusetts employer in respect to the unemployment compensation tax over the average American employer during these eight years . " Since the Galenson study was completed , the taxes on employers were raised on Jan. 1 of this year to the highest rate , possible under the law . Only three other states have as high a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have declined . If defense production is maintained for several years , the taxes then may be restored to their original levels .
