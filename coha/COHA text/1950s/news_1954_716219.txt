txt The Los Angeles speech of Rear Admiral Lewis L. Strauss , Atomic Energy Commission chief , establishes beyond doubts of men anywhere that President Eisenhower is determined to do all he can to develop the power of the uranium atom for peaceful uses . A conference of natural scientists from many countries of the world , which the President now proposes , may not  --  probably will not ? produce spectacular results ; conferences usually are unspectacular . But such a meeting of international researchers certainly should stimulate the thinking of mankind to the enormous potential for electric power which is locked up in the atom , applicable in many areas of the world where there can be no other type of power . And this is what President Eisenhower encourages  --  distant as its realization still is  --  and which he first suggested in his Dec. 8 address to the United Nations last year . Then he proposed an international atomic energy agency to foster the development of atomic power anywhere in the world under suitable UN control . Concrete Plan Set That proposal has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and other countries and now has , as Admiral Strauss said , " been formulated into a concrete plan " ; no details , however , are disclosed . So exclusively has the attention of the world been focusec upon the weapons aspect of atomic energy that a special event , such as the international conference proposed by Admiral Strauss in behalf of the President , unquestionably is needed . And this convention of natural scientists could hardly fail to keep President Eisenhower 's world atomic bank before the eyes of the world , including the Soviet Union . For this plan  --  both for a convention and for an international agency to promote atomic power ? does not so far exclude the Soviets . Admiral Strauss did not discuss the sensitive question of whether or not Soviet nuclear scientists would be invited to such a convention . But the Kremlin has been asked to participate in the world atomic bank idea , which suggests that the Soviets will not be barred from the gathering of researchers , if they wish to participate . Contrasting Policies So far the Kremlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded this as in its own interest . On the very day , in fact , that Admiral Strauss announced the Eisenhower idea for the gathering the Soviet Union at the United Nations was the sole nation among 10 to vote against a proposal to study the possibilities of international control of atomic weapons . Moscow has been as consistent in its policy of non-cooperation as have the Americans in their policy to share the fruits of the atom . While the prospect of agreement on weapons remains only a mirage , at this time , the outlook for development of atomic power , both in the United States and abroad , is now something more than faint . A chief reason why it is now possible is because of the thousands of atomic bombs which the United , States has stockpiled , and because the supply of fissionable uranium is far larger today than could have been foreseen five or six years ago . That is why , as Admiral Strauss explained , the Eisenhower plan will in no way endanger the arms program . The United States is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another reason why the power outlook is more hopeful is that the development of reactors , to make power , is leaving the realm of theory and entering that of the practical . Every major speaker on the subject of fission reminds his audience that there is nothing halfway about the atom . It is capable of incredible assistance to man , or of unbelievable destruction . The specific words of Admiral Strauss on this point are worth recording , even if the message is not new : " For the first time since the discovery of fire , we have come into possession of a force with which we can enrich our lives incalculably or , failing to make that choice , we can wreck a large part of what we have inherited from the accumulated art , heart , and spirit of the generations which preceded us . " Admiral Strauss has established certain other points likewise of importance to the future . The President 's December speech , when the world atomic bank idea was first proposed , was months in preparation in Mr. Eisenhower 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It and could have delivered it had he cared to do so without benefit of manuscript . " Soviet 1-1-Blast The " last series " of Soviet nuclear tests , in 1953 , began " with a very large explosion . " This , the admiral said , was a hydrogen explosion . When the AEC chairman uses the words " very large " he is sure to be speaking of a force in the millions of tons of TNT . Large enough , that is , to " take out a city . " Admiral ? Strauss mentioned two aspects of the United States program in which he played a notable part . He stressed it at if Americans had not begun the hydrogen program in 1949 " we might now be in a position of weapon inferiority " to the Soviets . And he spoke of " aur intelligence arrangements , fortunately inaugurated in time " which enabled United States nuclear experts to know " months before the Russian people " of the first Soviet atomic explosion in September , 1949.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
