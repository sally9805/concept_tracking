When Chicago Sculptor Abbott Pattison got a commission to do four pieces of sculpture for the University of Georgia , he saw an opportunity to bring a touch of modernism to the sleepy , oak-shaded old campus . Pattison moved to Athens as sculptor in residence , last year put up his first work , a sharp-edged abstraction in marble . Somebody poured a can of green paint over it . <P> Last week , in front of a freshman dormitory , up went Pattison 's second piece of campus sculpture : a gaunt and gawky 11-foot welded-steel abstraction of a horse . Student reaction was immediate-and violent . Within a few hours hay was stuffed into the horse 's mouth , manure was piled under its rear end , balloons and confetti were attached to the exposed steel ribs . Three times during the night , students built bonfires under the sculpture , succeeded only in scorching the paint . <P> Next day university authorities took the horse down , carted it away to a place of safekeeping , and student tempers calmed . Pattison 's did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that happen to anyone 's idea . . . The university took quite a courageous step in . . . having me come down here and work in the first place . . . Now I think their action in taking the horse down and hiding it is cowardly . . . I feel terrible . " But Pattison decided to keep right on trying . Said he : " I 'm not going to be chased out of this by any means . "
