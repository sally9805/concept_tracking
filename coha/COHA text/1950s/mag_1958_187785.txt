THE most adventurous big-money backer modern art has ever known was the late Solomon R. Guggenheim , multi millionaire mining magnate ( Alaskan copper , Chilean nitrate , Bolivian tin ) who late in life switched from collecting traditional Dutch masters to avant-garde art under the tutelage of his good friend and mentor , Baroness Hilla Rebay von Ehrenwiesen , set up Manhattan 's Museum of Non-Objective Painting . Two years ago his nephew , Harry F. Guggenheim , announced a biennial , round-the-world search for new paintings , established a purse of $10,000 for first prize . <P> For the second running of the sweepstakes this year , separate three-man juries in 22 countries ( each with its own $1,000 national winner ) were set up to ensure that only the best reached the finish line . Fortnight ago three top jurists ( British Critic Sir Herbert Read , former Director General of French Museums Georges Salles and British Painter Morris Kestelman ) were flown to Manhattan , repaired to a storage warehouse to inspect the final 114 oils and pick the grand-prize winner . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sat in three chairs like the three judges of Hell . " <P> Judge Salles and his colleagues had good reason to chuckle . Reason : the winning work was not there at all , but 3,620 miles away on two 9-ft. - 8- in. - high walls at Paris ' new UNESCO headquarters ( see color ) . In a sense , the choice of Joan Mir , 65 , involved some polite intramural logrolling . Both Englishman Read and Frenchman Salles are on the UNESCO art committee that commissioned the murals . " I was prepared to find something else that competed with Mir , " Sir Herbert Read said , " but I did n't think for a moment the other works of art did . Surrealists are thought of as fantastic and frivolous . Without departing from the surrealist style , Mir had produced something on a monumental scale . " Georges Salles was ecstatic , declared : " Against the monotone of cement and travertine , Mir gives the song of color . It is not a painting against a wall ; it is the wall itself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lived in his native Spain since World War II , five years ago began new experiments in ceramics in collaboration with his old friend Josep Llorens-Artigas ( TIME , Jan. 7 , 1957 ) . For the past two years he has been working hard on his UNESCO mural . Its imaginative images combine childlike delight with echoes of primitive Catalan signs and symbols . Once Mir destroyed one whole wall when it failed to please him , and began again . " Guessing the color of ceramic is like cooking a biscuit-you never know how it will come out , " explained one expert ruefully . Mir 's principal aim : " To make the murals harmonize with the architecture . " <P> Some have complained that the results are close to infantile scribblings . Retorts Mir : " If no one attacked my work , it would be a mediocre thing .
