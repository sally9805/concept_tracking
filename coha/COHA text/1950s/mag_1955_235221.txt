" Black Rod ! Black Rod ! " rang the cry down Westminster 's vaulted corridors . The Commons ' heavy oak doors clashed shut ahead of the Queen 's messenger as they had for 300 years at that cry , in a traditional assertion of independence dating from the time that Charles I invaded the House of Commons with soldiers in an attempt to arrest Hampden , Pym and three other members in 1642 . Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod , Lieut . General Sir Brian Horrocks-once one of Ike 's corps commanders in World War II but now rigged up in kneebreeches-knocked three times with his staff at the barred doors . When the doors swung open , he ceremoniously summoned the members to attend upon Her Majesty in the House of Peers . <P> Thus last week opened the first new Parliament of Queen Elizabeth II 's reign . With the traditional show of reluctance , Speaker-elect W. S. ( " Shakes " ) Morrison was duly " dragged " to his chair by his sponsor and seconder . Next day he was conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , in the Commons ' name , " laid claim , by humble petition to Her Majesty , to all your ancient and undoubted rights and privileges , particularly to freedom of speech in debate , freedom from arrest , freedom of access to Her Majesty whenever occasion may require . . . " From 1399 to 1510 , six Speakers had lost their heads for presenting such claims-hence the traditional show of reluctance to assume the chair . <P> Scruffy Reality . As the Speaker began to administer to all members the oath of allegiance to the Queen , there was an outburst of cheers from the members ' benches and applause from the visitors ' gallery as a rosy , stout figure entered the chamber and took his place just below the gangway . Sir Winston Churchill-who once led all the rest-sat watching quietly as his former government colleagues trooped up ahead of him to take the oath . But when it came the turn of Labor 's front bench , Clem Attlee made a gracious gesture . He crossed to Churchill , shook Sir Winston 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to precede . Together , the two old antagonists , who have governed Britain for the last 15 years , walked up the aisle to the Speaker 's chair . <P> In all this ancient pomp , there was one concession to scruffy present reality . Because of the rail strike , the Queen gave up her traditional golden coach , instead drove to Westminster in a closed car to avoid drawing sightseeing crowds to add to London 's traffic snarl . But inside the House of Lords , ancient ceremony took over . Resplendent in white net and diamant , the imperial crown gleaming on her head and heavy purple robes sweeping back from her shoulders , the young Queen read the Speech from the Throne , written for her by " my government , " to an assemblage glittering with peers ' coronets and robes , the jewels and silks of their wives . The M.P.s , drab in black jackets and business suits , stood respectfully-there are no seats for them in the House of Lords .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
