The emotional impact of Harry Truman 's hurrah for Harriman had worn off , and it was time for the doughty old man to get down to the hard , cold business of politicking . His first serious move was to invite House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson to dinner in his Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel suite to enlist their aid for Ave . With high hopes that a convivial evening and some earnest talk would do the job , Truman produced a bottle of bourbon and , in the long-established spirit of Capitol Hill , proposed that the three " strike a blow for liberty . " * But the food was an unfortunately long time in arriving and , although the evening was mighty convivial , a top Truman aide confessed later : " They just never did get down to any kind of conclusive talk . " It was only the first of many inconclusive , frustrating experiences in Harry Truman 's bitter week . <P> Truman bought quite a bill of goods from the old cronies who had flocked to Harriman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Indiana 's Frank McKinney and New York 's Judge Samuel Rosenman assured him that Ave had lined up 450 or more first-ballot votes . They reasoned that such favorite sons as Ohio 's Frank Lausche , Michigan 's G. Mennen Williams and New Jersey 's Robert Meyner would hold their delegations for themselves , at the first sign of firm opposition to Stevenson . They reported that Stevenson 's following was lukewarm ( " Did you ever see an enthusiastic Stevenson man except for some of those right around him ? " ) and that it would , if Harry said the word , switch from Adlai to Ave . <P> A Vicious Turn . Disillusionment was swift and savage . In a full day of talking to " customers " in his suite , Harry Truman got only two half-vote delegates to switch . With the Democrats who really counted , Truman got nowhere . Even as he was going up to Truman 's suite , New Jersey 's Bob Meyner announced that he would have no part of a favorite-son candidacy . And Frank Lausche ( who refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry until after he had promised Stevenson 's managers that he would throw his Ohio support to Adlai . <P> When nobody would hop when he said frog , Harry Truman turned viciously on Stevenson . Interviewed by Publisher William Randolph Hearst Jr. , Truman said Stevenson " should have been taken off the platform " when , in his 1952 acceptance speech , he mentioned the possibility of a Democratic defeat . " In politics , " snapped Harry Truman , " the other fellow 's wrong and you 're right . You can not have a defeatist attitude . " Later that day , dictating a statement to newsmen , Truman said he was convinced Stevenson " could not carry a single state in addition to what he did carry " in 1952. * At a press conference next morning , Truman went all the way . Adlai Stevenson , he said , lacked fighting spirit and stood for a policy that was " a surrender of the basic principles of the Democratic Party . " He accused Stevenson of aligning himself with " a conservative minority that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
