Most Americans have never heard of a huge and mysterious corporation called the Music Corp . of America . The mystery is intentional on the part of M.C.A. ; it abhors publicity . Yet it is the nation 's top talent agency in the publicity-loving world of entertainment , and is one of the most potent forces in determining what the U.S. sees on TV and movie screens-the General Motors of the entertainment world . Last week the Justice Department was investigating M.C.A . and its smaller rival . William Morris , which together reportedly control 80% of U.S. TV talent . The question : Are they too powerful ? <P> M.C.A . has built its empire on a simple economic principle ; it takes 10% on any contract it makes for its gold-plated clients . It gets 10% from movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe , Gregory Peck , Marlon Brando and Gary Grant ; from playwrights such as Arthur Miller , Tennessee Williams and William ( The Dark at the Top of the Stairs ) Inge ; and from novelists such as James ( From Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Stone . It owns or represents such TV shows as Wagon Train , Tales oj Wells Fargo , Jack Benny , Ozzie and Harriet , Alfred Hitchcock , Dragnet and This Is Your Life . Revue Productions Inc. , one of M.C.A . ' s subsidiaries , is Hollywood 's biggest producer of TV films , accounts for an estimated 25% of all television films . Another subsidiary , Management Corp . of America , bought Paramount 's pre-1948 movie backlog several weeks ago for $50 million and will distribute the films to television . <P> M. ( for Music ) D. In the trade , M.C.A . is known as " the octopus , " but it keeps its tentacles well hidden . Its gross income is also a closely guarded secret , but estimates range as high as $100 million . Secrecy is an M.C.A . policy because the firm believes that publicity is for clients alone . To further their anonymity , M.C.A . agents dress as conservatively as bankers ; the M.C.A . black suit is legend . And no one tries to dodge the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder , board chairman and boss , Jules Caesar Stein , 61 . <P> Born in South Bend , Ind. , Stein originally set out to be a doctor , got an M.D. at Chicago 's Rush Medical College in 1921 , studied ophthalmology at the University of Vienna , wrote a learned treatise ( " The Use of Telescopic Spectacles and Distil Lensen " ) after he returned to Cook County Hospital as a resident . He organized a band in which he played the fiddle , made bookings for other bands for a fee , finally teamed up with William R. Goodheart Jr. , who later retired , to found M.C.A . as a band-booking agency in 1924 . This sideline proved so profitable that Dr. Stein took it up full time . He signed exclusive rights with hotels and ballrooms , thus forcing bandleaders to come to him . M.C.A . bandleaders who became unruly found themselves with poor bookings . Later he developed other sidelines-sold liquor to nightclub owners as part of the deal for a band , sold his musicians insurance , real estate and cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1936 , still holds it .
