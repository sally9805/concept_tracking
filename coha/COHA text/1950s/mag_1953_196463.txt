From the major banking houses and money dealers in Europe last week , cables went out to England checking a rumor . The rumor : Russia is dumping 1,000,000 oz. of gold on the market , and the Bank of England has bought some of it in a private deal . The bank in line with its usual policy , refused either to confirm or deny buying gold . But there was no doubt that Russia has been selling gold in European markets . Bars stamped with the Soviet hammer &; sickle showed up in Amsterdam , apparently shipped there from Czechoslovakia . Bankers estimated that Russia had sold about 250,000 oz. ( worth almost $9,000,000 ) . <P> Ornaments &; Questions . Although this is a small amount , the news of Russian selling was enough to drive gold down to $35.55 an oz. , the lowest price since the war , and only a shade above the official price of $35 an ounce . South Africa , which has sold gold under the guise of ornaments , found the subterfuge no longer worth it ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa announced that it would sell production openly on the world market , something that its sister dominions , Canada and Australia , have been doing since 1952 . <P> To the big question why Russia had sold gold , the best answer was that it had run short of both sterling and European currencies to pay for its normal trade across the Iron Curtain . In trade with continental Europe alone , the Soviet bloc has run a $15 million deficit in the first seven months of the year v. a $13 million surplus last year . <P> Hoarders &; Health . Actually , the Russian sales only accelerated a decline in gold prices that has been going on for months . Partly , the decline was caused by the fall in commodity prices generally . For example , tightfisted French farmers are getting less for their wheat and wine , thus are able to buy less gold to hoard away in secret hiding places . The decline in gold prices was a heartening sign of European economic health . With inflation no longer a serious problem , hoarders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were actually releasing considerable amounts of it . In the first half of this year , the non-Communist world 's legal gold stocks increased by $800 million although only $425 million worth of new gold was produced . <P> Only in France , Europe 's greatest hoarding nation , was the drop in gold prices a serious worry to the government . There , so many distrustful citizens have gold coins tucked away in tissue-paper wrappings that the government can not afford to let prices fall too far . As gold Napoleons fell last week to 3,480 francs ( $9 ) , the lowest price since June 1950 , the Bank of France quietly began buying coins to help support the market .
