Hypnosis may be an effective technique in controlling persistent hiccups . So say Internists Gordon Bendersky and Martin Badin in the A.M.A. 's Archives of Internal Medicine . They cite one patient who began hiccuping after hospital treatment for a coronary occlusion , failed to respond to a wide range of conventional treatments ( e.g. , drugs , sedation , nerve stimulation ) . After one session of deep hypnosis , the attacks stopped . Many doctors disregard hypnosis on the ground that it suppresses symptoms without attacking the ailment 's cause ( whether emotional or organic ) , but the authors argue otherwise . Their conclusion : Because psychological problems may be the dominant factor in many cases of hiccups , hypnosis can be a most effective treatment , especially when surgery is impracticable or when the spasms are a danger to life . <P> Should everyone be immunized against lockjaw ?

Only 25% of the population has been immunized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds ; thus the disease is a clear threat ( an average 325 deaths a year ) to anyone . The tetanus immunization shot , says Dr. Edsall , is not only one of the safest toxoids known to man , it is also among the most effective : the U.S. Army 's tetanus rate was 13 per 100,000 injuries in preimmunization World War I , only twelve cases for 2,500,000 injuries during World War II . <P> The nation 's worst polio season since Salk vaccine came into widespread use in 1955 shows no certain signs of letup .
