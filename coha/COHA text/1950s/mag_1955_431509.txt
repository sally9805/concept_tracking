WHEN THE Founding Fathers established our government structure of liberty under law , they borrowed from the ancient Romans a remarkable device  --  the Tribunes of the People . The job of the Tribunes , officials elected from the ranks of the Assembly of the People , was to see that the laws were enforced , that justice was done to the ordinary citizen . The Fathers of our country , realizing that this function of the Tribunes was indispensable to liberty , assigned it to the investigating committees of Congress . Like the Roman Tribunes , Congressional investigators are immune from arrest or prosecution . They are therefore able to challenge without fear of reprisal the immense power of the police , the Army and the Executive . Congress ? our own Assembly of the People ? charges its investigators with the task of finding out whether our laws are being enforced and whether new laws are needed . On the basis of facts unearthed by its investigators , Congress is also empowered to impeach and expel from office any member of the executive and judicial branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court . Short of impeachment , the investigating committees can check executive action by appeal , through public hearings , to the final court of a democracy : the citizen-voters . Congressional investigators can reflect - the ignorance and the passions of the people as well as the people 's traditional wisdom , loyalty and strength . But they are irreplaceable champions of our liberty . In 1936 Hugo Black , now a member of the Supreme Court , then a Senator , wrote : " The probe is one of the most powerful weapons to restrain the activities of groups who can defy every other power . Public investigating committees exist always in  | countries where the people rule . They have always been opposed by groups that seek or have special privileges . " The first Congressional investigation took place in 1792 , just three years after adoption of our Constitution . The Indians of the Northwest Territory had all but annihilated a Government force led against them by General Arthur St. Clair , and popular opinion demanded an explanation . When the House of Representatives selected an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be insulting to President Washington , who had appointed St. Clair , and that Congress should merely request the President to look into the matter himself . The majority insisted , however , that Congress make its own investigation in its own way . The inquiry , as it turned out , absolved General St. Clair of personal blame , but made constructive criticisms that led to improved organization of the War Department . All but three of our 84 Congresses have authorized investigations . The areas investigated have included every department of the executive branch of government ; every war except the Spanish-American ; all sorts of election scandals ; railroads , shipping , oil , banking , housing , insurance , utilities ? in fact , nearly every major industry . Investigations of conspiracy and espionage are by no means a loth-century novelty . Even before 1800 , espionage in behalf of France and Spain ? was investigated . Subversive conspiracy was the issue in inquiries of 18o8 concerning Aaron Burr 's associates . Violent controversy has always swirled around Congressional investigations . In the 1920 's a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler and Walsh for the inquiries that brought to light the shocking scandals of the Naval Reserve oil leases . Owen J , Roberts , later an Associate Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court , speaking before the American Bankers Association , condemned the oil investigation as " propaganda for nationalization . " The Wall Street Journal dismissed it as " only a political smokescreen . " Discussing this and the parallel investigation of Attorney General Daugherty , the New York Times declared in February 1924 that Congress was " investigation-mad , " and was trying to introduce " government by clamor . " The Times upheld Daugherty as one who was defending " decency " and " honor . " Within six months Daugherty had resigned in disgrace ? after the investigators had shown that during his two and a half years in Washington on a $15,000 salary , his personal financial position had shifted from $19,000 in the red to $100,000 in the black . At the time of this Teapot Dome probe , the Senate investigators were termed " scandal-mongers , " " mudgunners , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " a lynching-bee , " " poison-tongued partisanship , " " twittering hysteria . " But as a result of their disclosures , one corrupt Cabinet member ( Harry Daugherty ) and one who winked at corruption ( Edwin Denby ) were forced to resign . Albert Fall , along with oil magnate Harry F. Sinclair and a variety of lesser figures , went to jail . Four oil millionaires skipped the country . The scandalous leases of Naval Reserve oil at Teapot Dome , Elk Hills and Buena Vista were canceled , with a saving to the taxpayers of hundreds of millions of dollars . Reorganization of the Justice Department , another consequence of these investigations , brought major benefits to the nation through stricter , more equitable law enforcement . Only Congressional investigation could have produced such results . Individual citizens were helpless . The courts were powerless to initiate action . The executive agencies were either unaware of what was happening or conniving at it . Tribunes of the People , armed with sufficient power , were required to expose the wrong-doing , arouse public opinion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees is to assist Congress in its Constitutional task of making and changing our laws . In order to make laws wisely , Congress must have before it the relevant facts . But Congress can not simply take the alleged facts of a situation from some other agency , or from the executive branch . It must take full , independent responsibility itself for the information upon which its law-making decisions will rest . Congress gains this information by conducting its own investigations in its own way . A related function of Congressional investigations is to check up on what happens to laws after they are passed . Committees like the " watch-dog committee " of World War II , in which Harry Truman made his mark , have saved billions of dollars by keeping a critical eye on the Government 's military contracts and administrative methods . Nearly every important reorganization of governmental structure has come as a result of Congressional inquiries . Repeated 19th-century investigations of frauds in private mail contracts , for example , led to the formation of the General Post Office . Time and again investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from as early as 1797 when William Blount was expelled from the Senate for stirring up the Indians to rebellion . Only a Congressional probe was able to penetrate the vast Credit Mobilier scandal which by 1872 had engulfed both Europe and this country , and involved even the U. S. Vice-President and former Speaker of the House , as well as many of the nation 's leading financiers . In our own day Congressional investigations were the first agency to inform the public concerning totalitarian threats to liberty . Beginning  | in 1938 , the House Committee on Un-American Activities exposed , first the Fascist and Nazi groups that were then actively conspiring against our security , and next the Communist apparatus that continues to conspire . It was this committee that dug out the case of Alger Hiss , along with the operations of the Silvermaster , Perlo and Ware espionage cells . In recent years its work has been supplemented by the Senate 's Internal Security and Permanent Investigations subcommittees . These committees , granted their excesses , deserve chief credit for the fact that today , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have at last begun to deal effectively with the subversive conspiracy against our survival as a free nation . Despite the attacks to which they have often been subjected ? and which they have sometimes deserved ? Congressional investigations have thus proved themselves an essential part of our system of government . The new Congress now has before it a number of proposals for the " reform " of investigating committees by the establishment of strict rules of procedure . Undoubtedly there have been abuses in the conduct of investigations ? great power is always liable to abuse and corruption . But can they be corrected by detailed rules laid down in advance ? The reputation of an author may be damaged by an unfair review , but we do not demand a law that would prescribe in detail the methods of book reviewing . A committee hearing is not a trial . It can not take away a man 's life or liberty . Many of the meticulous rules of the courtroom are inapplicable . Recent discussion has invariably arisen in connection with the committees investigating Communist subversion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for civil rights , we should remember that the aim of the Communists is to put an end to all investigations of subversion , treason and espionage . The procedures of the committees are governed by Congressional tradition , by special rules adopted by each committee , and by the personal influence of leading members , particularly the chairmen , As a matter of tradition and privilege they accord to witnesses nearly all the rights that would be made a matter of inflexible law if the bills now before Congress are passed : for example , the right to have counsel , to submit a written statement , to answer accusations by other witnesses , and so on . The effect of transforming these privileges into law would be to obstruct or even paralyze the work of the committees . If the law required the presence of counsel for a witness , a Communist lawyer could stop a hearing merely by becoming so obstreperous that it could not continue : If the committee threw him out , it would then have to adjourn until the witness produced another  | lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been objection to " oneman hearings . " It does seem fair that at least two committee members , one from each party , should be present when a witness is questioned . But under a rule requiring the presence of two members , many Senate investigations could never be finished . With all they have to do , there are just not enough Senators to go around , particularly when many committee hearings must be held in distant parts of the country . Furthermore , if an investigation were hurting one of the political parties , the committee members belonging to that party could bring it to a halt merely by staying away from the hearings . In reality , the only requirement on this point that is both fair and practicable is that all members of a committee should have advance notice of every meeting , so that they may attend if they wish . The basic problem of " one-man hearings " is the man , not the rules . Some critics have said that we should copy the " responsible " and " objective " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , those Royal Cornmissions are composed of laymen chosen for their interest in the sub-ect , and they question only volunteers who desire to give information . It does seem desirable that Congress should eliminate the " overlapping " of its committee jurisdictions , so that there will no longer be the wasteful spectacle of three or four different committees " competing , " and interfering , with each other in the investigation of some problem . These investigations should doubtless be confined to one committee in each House . Some Congressmen go further , and have introduced bills to set up a single Joint ( SenateHouse ) Committee on Internal Security , modeled after the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy . In general , however , abuses by investigating committees are not going to be corrected by enactment of a code of rules . When a Congressional committee attempts to cite an individual for contempt , the individual has the right to bring forth all facts and circumstances in support of his assertion that his constitutional rights had been violated . And if a Congressional investigator blatantly disregards truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about his removal from committee assignment , his censure or his expulsion . Moreover , the people in their turn will have the opportunity to vote him out of public life . Thirty years ago a clamor for changes in procedure arose in connection with the Teapot Dome investigations , just as today they arise in connection with the investigations of Communist subversion . At that earlier time perhaps the most eloquent defense ever made of Congressional investigation came from the pen of the young Felix Frankfurter , who was destined for later  | membership on the Supreme Court : " Critics seek to shackle the future by suggesting restrictions in the procedure of Congressional investigations . No limitations should be imposed . The methods and forms of each investigation should be left for determination of Congress and its committees , as each situation arises . The safeguards against abuse and folly are to be looked for in the forces of responsibility which are operating within Congress and are generated from without . "  |                @ @ @ @ @
