The build-up was impressive : Rico Lebrun , who at 51 is among the nation 's most respected artists , devoted five years to planning and painting a giant triptych entitled Crucifixion ; it was well received by his Los Angeles neighbors , and last week Manhattan 's choosy Museum of Modern Art had the picture on show . The work itself turned out to be something of a shocker . <P> An elephantine 16 by 26 ft. , it is actually not a Crucifixion , but a Descent from the Cross . Brilliant draftsman that he is , Lebrun has defined every shape dramatically , but they are all ugly , including the figure of Christ , and many are menacing as barbed wire besides . The color is a dirty near-monochrome , was used by Lebrun in the hope that a film short would be based on his picture . It has the glaring light and the wriggling shadows of a flashbulb photograph . <P> Christ 's crown of thorns marks the mathematical center of the composition , but not the spiritual center . Lebrun has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above His bowed head the face of an anonymous ghoul , a monster that seems to set the overall tone . <P> The critics were more than kind . " Extraordinarily powerful and moving , " one wrote . Another praised it as being " in the pictorial language of a 20th Century painter who is aghast at man 's inhumanity to man . " Lebrun 's technique is clearly 20th Century , since it derives from Picasso 's Guernica-done in 1937 . That tormented masterpiece has a less pretentious theme ( the bombing of a Spanish town ) and a saving element of compassion that Lebrun 's lacks . <P> But for all its lacks , Lebrun 's triptych does have great force-enough to compete with war pictures and even neon signs . That may well be the reason for its critical success . Fifty years ago , critics were so intent on judging an artist 's skill that they misjudged such unskilled but forceful painters as Gauguin and Van Gogh . For better or worse , a lot of modern critics now rate forcefulness first .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
