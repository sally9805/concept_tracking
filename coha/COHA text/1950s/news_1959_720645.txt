txt BIG 4 BYPASS it N. WITH NEW COUNCIL ON DISARMAMENT East and West Each to Have 5 Seats to Comply With Soviet Parity Demand ACCORD SET IN GENEVA Group Is Expected to Invite Hammarskjold to Send Observer to Parleys By THOMAS J. HAMILTON Special to The New York Timm . UNITED NATIONS , N. Y. , Aug. ** four big powers have decided to set up new machinery for disarmament negotiations that , in effect , would take over the responsibility from the United Nations Disarmament Commission . Under an agreement reached in Geneva last week , on the last day of the foreign ministers ' conference on Berlin , a ten-nation group on disarmament will be established . Reliable sources said today that its membership , in accordance with a Soviet demand for parity , would be divided equally between the Western and Communist powers . In addition to the United States , Britain and France , the Western side is to include Canada and Italy . The Communist side is to consist of the Soviet Union , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Rumania and Albania . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new commission or committee  --  its name has not been finally decided  --  would not be entirely independent of the United Nations . It was indicated that Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold would be invited to send an observer to its meetings , which may be held either at the United Nations Headquarters or at the regional headquarters in Geneva . However , it was learned that Mr. Hammarskjold expressed concern over the plan last Wednesday , when the United States , British and French representatives paid separate calls on him to inform him of the great powers ' decision . No information was available on whether the Soviet representative had called on him . Available sources indicated today that the great powers would not ask the General Assembly to approve their decision to set up a separate disarmament group . It was understood that their decision to act outside the United Nations resulted from their fear that the Assembly would not accept the new group without adding India and possibly other uncommitted countries . However , several delegates predicted that the Assembly would insist upon debating the ques // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-power communiqu ? issued in Geneva a week ago said the Big Four foreign ministers had had " useful talks " on methods of resuming disarmament negotiations . The communiqu ? said the decision would be announced after consultations with Mr. Hammarskjold and with other members ' Of the United Nations . Since the group envisaged by the great powers does not include any Asian , African or Latin-American states , protests by India and other neutralist countries are expected at the 1959 session of the General As-sembly , Mr. Hammarskjold indicated recently that he would submit the disarmament question for inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly if it was not submitted by the Disarmament Commission or a membei nation . New Unit Viewed as Paramount Although the new machinery ' proposed by the great , powers " would not interfere directly ' with the Disarmament Commission , reliable sources said they , thought it would pre-empt the field . From 1954 to 1957 , when it held its last meeting , the commission 's efforts to achieve an agreement on disarmament have been made entirely through a subcommittee consisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France and Canada . Since this gave the West a four-to-one majority , it had been ' generally understood that more Communist members would have to be placed on the subcommittee if the Disarmament Com'mission was to function again . The commission did not meet last year because of the Soviet boycott . Although fourteen additional members were placed on it after the 1957 session of the Assembly , raising the total to twenty-five , the Soviet Union protested that it still had a proWestern majority . The 4oviet Union agreed to attend this year after the membership of the commission , in accordance with its demand , was raised to eighty-two last December for a trial period of a year . However , the commission has not met in 1959 because its members were awaiting the outcome of the separate negotiations in Geneva on machinery for detecting surprise attacks and for prohibiting nuclear test explosions . Selwyn Lloyd , British Foreign Secretary , was understood to have taken the lead in working out the membership of the new group with Andrei A. Gromyko , Soviet Foreign Minister .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
