" " It 'll be all right , " said George , hoping Columbus would understand that he did n't mean the knife . " I spec Pall come back soon . , " You reckon e will ? " And the brightness was still in his eyes when he turned away toward the Murchison house . Even Columbus felt part of this loneliness , poor kid , working his tail off to make a little money and without the gumption to spend it on himself to kill the loneliness . But he did n't feel so much of it , so many different kinds , as George did . For at last , after months of hesitation when the school turned him out of its highest grade , Lincoln had gone away . It was merely a final gesture , perhaps none too soon , of a separation that would have grown more apparent the more apparent George 's anxiety became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebe 's window , George now knew was the first sign : he was already deserted ; or if not , he must desert Lincoln . Their continued association , in spite of joviality and pranks and underlying affection , only emphasized their separateness to George , and made him sadder to pretend where he no longer trusted and to laugh where in fact he feared . For George could never wipe out the contempt in Lincoln 's insult ? " ai n't gon na  | live like black niggers all my life " ? nor overcome the terror inspired by Lincoln 's solution . He had tried to salvage their friendship by telling himself hopefully that Lincoln was n't serious about that night . But it was no use ; he could only have memories of what it used to be , just as Aunt Martha had hers . For the more he saw Lincoln those last weeks , the more he was disturbed by him . George had observed him one evening on the edge of the crowd outside the Opera House . It was a big occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a demonstration of moving pictures , a sort of new trick done with lights , and the white people had turned it into a social event . From carriages and the four automobiles , the " box parties " dismounted and moved through the straggle of curious onlookers waiting on the sidewalk , into the yellow glow of the lobby . Through the open doors came a lively tune played by the orchestra , lightly filtering over the comments of the crowd . " What is movin pictures ? " asked a Negro woman beside George . " They moves , " explained a man with her . " They ' as in the ' Lectric The-ater at the circus las year . In the side show . Kind o scared me . Cuttin off folks ' heads , an trains runnin at you . " George wound around the outer edge of the cluster to reach Lincoln 's side . Over the heads he could see him , his shoulder leaning against the brick wall just beyond the fan of light spilling from the lobby . Lincoln did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln 's eyes , though seeming to watch the richly dressed arrivals , were actually darting here and there over those nearest him ; then he turned them swiftly and warily down the dark street behind him . And in that movement , caught briefly in the glow , George saw the eyes burning dry under unblinking lids , the tense , hungering face that explained them , and suddenly , a thin , red-haired girl , not four feet from Lincoln . He stood motionless , imagining that Lincoln was moving toward the white girl , and tried to say to himself , " Go to him  --  go stop him  --  make him understand . " But it was impossible  --  to say it , to do it , much more to understand . Shamed by his failure ? no , his cowardice  --  and hating his friend for it , George hurried away .  | And now that Lincoln was gone , and with him the oppressive anxiety , George felt only loneliness again . No matter how much he insisted that he was glad , because Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trouble , he missed him and day after day wondered what Lincoln was doing in New Orleans . ' What , besides his job ; he had written once , a few lines  --  he was fine , it was a nice town and real big , he had a job at a hotel ; but what else  --  what , that was bringing some Miss Hebe Dalton to his arms , or someone else , like May perhaps , or some pal to take his own place ; what , in the evenings , when he just wanted to cut up , as they used to together . In the slack times at ' Harper 's barber shop , between the shining of a customer 's shoes and the later whisking of his coat and sweeping up hair and washing basins and gathering towels , he would sit on a box by the window , gazing at the passers-by outside , oblivious of the blustering talk around him , and by transposing experiences picture Lincoln in a place he thought might be New Orleans . He could see Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she white or black ? ? on his arm . Swiftly they would embrace , Lincoln 's form hiding her completely , and swiftly their clothing vanished , and the street and the houses , and they were suspended , interlocked , on a vague mass like cushions , or clouds , or dark snow . George drew a deep , nervous sigh . " What 's a matter , George ? Thinkin bout yo gal ? " asked Jimmy Harper . George looked around , scratched his head and grinned , according to the custom . " Nawsuh  --  well , yessuh , I was . Kind o . " Strolling to the back of the room , he let his eyes dance over the shelf of tonic and lotion behind the barber chairs . He pointed to one jar . " Mist ' Harper , can I have some o this stickum fo my hair ? " " Tryin to straighten out them kinks ? " " Yessuh , if'n I can . " " Oh sure , but do n't take much . It ai n't gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread some of the jelly between his palms and then rubbed it over his tiny short curls . As he combed it back , careful to have fumbled his own comb obviously  | from a hip pocket , he watched the effect in the mirror and decided he must let his hair grow longer . The two barbers , sprawling in the leather and metal chairs , chuckled at his efforts and began to offer advice . " What you need is a cow to lick it back for you . " " Thing to do , George , " suggested Harper , " is get some curlers an roll it up backwards . That 'll unwind the kinks . " George 's face took on a look of amiable agreement with the jokes . If it did n't , the barbers would think he thought their jokes were n't funny , and they 'd feel sad ; they 'd think he was " uppity " ; they 'd fire him . He had realized quickly that he was now in a new world where his success , puny though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Possum I-Iollow , McCabe 's dice game , dances and all the places where Negroes gathered for work or play among themselves , he could be himself . No pressure weighed on him to distort his natural expression , except such as May put there , trying to give him " good manners . " But in the barber shop , he was alone , a stranger unwanted , unrespected , untrusted , unsuitable , in a world of white men . He must restrain his comments , his movements , his countenance , and fit them to those considered proper and natural for a Negro , and imposed on him . Doing so was n't difficult , George complimented himself ; it was as if he had learned it already  --  by imitation of his elders , by slow unconscious indoctrination . But the daily practice of it left him empty . Sometimes , to create the impression that he had many friends in the shop , he would stare into one of the panels of mirrors which faced each other from the side walls , and find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved the same way , at the same time , and the impression almost at once lost its satisfaction . He left the shop each evening between six and six-thirty , depending on whether there was a late customer . And then the outside world seemed to shrink about him , as if all were no bigger than the cubbyhole of a barber shop . Now that winter had come , it was harder to find anything to do at night , and his loneliness was keener . A cold fog had settled over the town and through it the widely spaced street lights glowed like a line of far moons in a strange sky . Figures emerged startlingly from the mist and vanished with no sound but the click of their heels .  | The store windows were being decorated for the Christmas season and he paused before one to watch . Beds of cotton covered the display floor and tiers of low boxes at the back , and the edges of the glass had been artificially frosted with a silver paint . The clerks sprinkled the cotton with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snowy levels , and beside each gift dropped sprigs of imitation holly and over it all scattered more glittering dust . With the draping of tinsel rope from which dangled a series of bright-colored glass balls , and the hanging of a wreath on the background , the window was finished . It was very pretty ; he liked just standing there and being tickled by the gleam and shimmer of the things . The stores in the cities where Lincoln and Cora were , he supposed , must be more dazzling than this ; that was why they would never come back . George shoved his hands closer to his legs , knotting them into fists , and shrugged his shoulders to raise the standing collar of his mackinaw around his chilly ears . With a quick movement he turned away and walked rapidly up a street to the west , toward Miss Lucy 's shack in Rosson Row . Maybe they had heard from Lincoln ; maybe he was coming home Christmas ; maybe he had written that the city was no good and he was coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat uncomfortably by the fire between her and May . Yes , Lincoln had written , just that week ; but he must eat supper with them if he wanted to see the letter . He made feeble excuses , to which May retorted , " Ai n't goin to read you the letter ' less you stay . " " Yes , stay , George , " added Miss Lucy . " We gets a bit lonesome sometimes , jus us two . An we don see you like we used to ? now with Lincoln gone . " Lonesome ? thought George . Where were all those beaux that May was supposed to have ? Maybe she had a right , being young like him , to be lonesome . But Miss Lucy had never suggested such a thing before ; she had Mr. Theo and that was all she wanted . Listening to May read the letter , he could find no assurance that the city was disappointing . New Orleans was full of people from some foreign country and they talked a funny language , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way ; he had met some real fine folks , he wrote , and hoped soon to have a job on  | the docks or in a sugar warehouse . The work was dirtier than bellhopping , but it paid more . Tell George hello , said the last line . May folded the paper , returned it to its envelope and replaced it on the marble-topped table by the door . " I d'clare I don know what I 'd do ' f I did n't have you to read to me , " sighed Miss Lucy . " Makes me feel real ole to think about my boy workin way off in New Orleans . " With a short laugh , May glanced at George . " You ai n't ole , Ma , you jus not feelin well , tha 's all . " Then , in a lower tone to George : " When things don go jus right , she gets to thinkin she 's ole . " " Me , too , sometimes , " said George . " Why , you ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe not , but I sho feel ole sometimes . " " Like when ? " " Like when I think how long I 've lived , " said George . " Why , I can ' member way back ? ' most to when you was born . " Miss Lucy crowed . " Heee ! You was n't hardly big enough to grab a sugar-tit yo'self ! " Embarrassed at such a reference to his babyhood , George said no more and began to gaze stolidly at the flames and the cleanswept hearth . Miss Lucy 's house , with its neat floors and fumiture , its wallpaper and cozy curtains and the worn rug , seemed so like the home of a white workman that George never felt entirely at ease in it and rarely looked around . And he was bound to recall , whenever he felt this , the house was at intervals , in the night , the home of a white man . To have this feeling after he had sensed the atmosphere of the room made it impossible for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reveal it to them . " You awful quiet , " said May . " I guess you still meditatin on yo age . " He laughed self-consciously and , trying to relax , leaned back in his chair and raised his chin slightly . His glance raked the mantel shelf  --  that row of all the objects that seemed to say " white " here more than in his own home : the two bronze things with projecting rings that held milky glass cones , ruffly edged , and like a peculiar flower , the cut-glass candy jar , the pink and blue china shepherdess in a puffy dress  --  but more quickly shrank  | away , for now it said " white " more plainly than ever . In a silver frame , a picture , which he had never noticed before , sat among the bric-a-brac . Mr. Theo  --  it could only be him , with that pale face  --  was there in the room , had been all the time , gazing sternly over his mustaches from the mantel . Somehow , with the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmer , though he would n't look back to be sure he had n't imagined he saw the photograph . " You chillun jus kills me off , a-talkin about age , " said Miss Lucy . " When you gets like me  --  all wo out  --  an ugly ... " George was suddenly aware that the vitality which had been a great part of her charm was deserting Miss Lucy . Her face , though fuller , still retained those warm , gently rounding features which had marked her as a pretty girl . Her figure was still strong , and the aura of warmth and affection , which was emerging in May , still lingered about her . But in her eyes he could no longer find the proud assurance and the joyous flashes that he remembered . Something unhappy and fearful flickered there . " Why , Miss Lucy , " he was amazed to hear himself saying , " you jus as pretty as you ever was . " " Thank you , George , " Miss Lucy responded with a fleeting gaiety . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ave ? ever ? " The sentence trailed off into silence . Painfully erect in his chair , George dared not raise his glance to the picture on the mantel shelf , though the feeling that both the women had turned in wincing consciousness to it urged him to look . He suffered through the quietness . At last Miss Lucy , with a thin sigh , said she 'd see about supper and , to his relief , left them alone . " How you like the barber shop ? " asked May , when her mother had gone . " Oh , pretty good . It 's better'n carryin cows . " " I think it 's a lot nicer too . Mo dignified an distinguished . " " Where you get all them words ? " " Like what ? " " Like dignified and distink  --  or whatever it is . You been throwin out words long as Main Street . " " Oh George , I jus said yo new job was mo dignified than takin care o cows . You know what I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Well , dignified is what white folks is when they dress up an have comp'ny . Stickin out the ' hands an sayin howjewdew ? ' an whiskin fans aroun an lookin about halfway up to the ceilin . Like this . " She jumped up and swooping about the room caricatured a white " lady " on her party manners . George laughed loud as she waved her arms , giving orders to the servants , and extended limp wrists , greeting guests , and grimaced and wriggled , flirting with the gentlemen . " Well , my job ai n't nothin like that , " said George , when she had finished . " Yeah , but it 's the ' sociation , " May insisted . " If you work for dignified folks , yo job 's dignified an you catch it too . But when you jus tend to cows  --  cows ai n't got no dignity . " " Why , they has , too , " retorted George . " They walks jus like Miz Stoddard do . " May squealed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , cutting off her laughter , " they ca n't give you manners like workin aroun men that 's got mustaches to smooth out , an walkin canes , an seegars , an alI . " " What good 's it gon na do me to get a lot o manners ? " asked George , after a moment 's pause in which he thought of the photograph and of his insult to May on the pasture road . I-le had resisted an impulse to make a scornful remark ; he must not give in to such cruelty , such childishness , again . " I ai n't got no place to use em . " " You have , too . ' F you ca n't think of any other place , you can use em here . Me an Mama likes it . " Miss Lucy began to bring the supper in to the table at the center of the room , and May left George to help her . When they had finished eating , and the dishes were removed to the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand on the mantelpiece , and stared into the fire . " I think I 'll go lie down , " she said , as if confiding in the flames . Then she turned slowly and spoke in a more hearty tone . " Better th'ow on some mo wood , May . . . . Good night , George . Come back soon . " She smiled at him a little sadly and disappeared through the door to her room . May dragged a stick of wood from the bin and tossed it on the grate . " You was s'posed to do that fo me , " she said . " Is that what dignified is ? " asked George .  | " No , it 's manners . " There seemed little for them to talk about now . While May stared at the crackling logs , spouting sparks , George looked at her carefully . In the mellow light , her skin seemed very pale , and her eyes very soft like those of a grateful animal . What he noticed particularly , with a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her arms and ankles and the outline of her bosom beneath the calico dress . Having thought of her for so long merely as Lincoln 's sister , he now felt a bit guilty to think the things he did . He tried to avoid them by asking softly , " Is Miss Lucy ailin some ? " " She 's not very well , I guess , " May replied hesitantly . " She do n't act a-tall like crself . Kind o sad all the time . " " Reckon it 's somethin serious ? " " I  --  think I know what it is . But I ca n't tell fo sure . She been goin to see Lily Johns . " " The hoodoo woman ? " May nodded . He looked into her eyes , steadily for a moment , then uncertainly . For , in the face of the flood of sympathy that welled in them , as if appealing to him for justice , he was shaken . If there were some way he could show his understanding and kindliness , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a cramped halting gesture toward the mantel shelf ? " You mean  --  you think ? ? " If only he could say that he felt it too , because his own father had gone away , that he knew too , from watching his mother , even though in scorn and irritation , how Miss Lucy choked between tender yearning and hard pride . " Papa has n't been here in nearly two months , " May said softly and falteringly . " Mama wo n't say much , but she 's  --  scared , I guess . She brought that out here last week . " May flicked a glance at the photograph . " Don say nothin about it , " she added . " Not to anybody . Maybe it 'll be all right . " They sat down , uneasy at their difficult , too personal topic , and were quiet for a long time . But as the silence dragged on , George sank deeper and deeper into a relaxation such as he had never known before in that house . Something in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father seemed to have toppled a barrier encircling him and to have cleared the atmosphere . Finally May turned with a smile .  | " What you scentin yo'self up with , George ? You smell mighty sweet tonight . " " Jus some hair stuff from the shop , " he said , grinning with pleasure . " They lets me use some sometimes . It makes yo hair stay put . " " Does it ? " she asked doubtfully , staring at the crag of hair that jutted above his forehead . " Le ' me feel it , " she said , stretching her hand toward the shining black whorls . He bent his head nearer and she brushed it lightly with her hand . Gurgling , she drew back and cried , " Oh , it 's all greasy ! " As she went to the washstand by the bedroom door to wipe her hand on a towel , she smelled the pomade in her palm . " It smells good , though . " In wonder , George watched her . What it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cut off his speech , he did n't know . He sat turned in his chair as if to rise , his hand grasping the back , stirred by a surprising impulse to go to her . But something hindered , and he waited , scarcely breathing , until she returned to her chair . When she smiled at him a tiny spasm rushed over his body . He mumbled and stood up . " I got a go . " Almost hastily he shook his mackinaw onto his arms and about his shoulders . Then he opened the door and with a look of alarm , said goodnight . " Good night , Mr. Mu'chison , " said May . During the following days , his remembrance of that evening was a source of stimulating amazement . He wavered between doubt of May 's sincerity and assurance of her favor . She had been very formal , very " dignified , " when he left : " Good night , Mister Murchison . " Did n't that mock him for his crudeness ? But since she had also smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign that she had raised him to a higher position ? He was unable to decide , and the questions arose in his mind while he worked or idled in the barber shop . Sometimes , as he stared out the windows into the thin gray rain , he would tell himself that there was no reason why he should n't have May if she wanted him . But for some unapparent reason , he could never find the courage to suggest his need to her . Though he tried to put her out of his thoughts , he was reminded of that first pleas-  | ant visit one morning when , to his discomfort , he was polishing Mr. Theo Burton 's boots . Mr. Jimmy Harper chatted as he trimmed the hair , and Mr. Bostwick , the other barber , slouched in one of the customers ' chairs , caressing a smoldering cigar with his lips . George 's rag made the rhythmic slaps he had learned to improvise on leather toes . " coin back to Memphis to see Miz What's-er-name ? " asked Mr. Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a told you that ? " rejoined Mr. Theo in mock amazement . " Where 've I been goin all these weeks , anyhow ? " " You better watch out , she 'll rope you in , " said Mr. Bostwick . " Remember she 's a woman what 's had experience . You may 've sowed some wild oats , all right , but you ai n't been married . " " Yeah , " said Mr. Jimmy , " you 're old as me , Theo , an you don know what really livin with a woman means  --  exactly . " George sneaked an apprehensive glance at Mr. Theo , but his cloth kept going Snap-rap-athap-bop-bop . Mr. Theo chuckled for a second and said , " Well , Adam ... " Then he chuckled some more . With a final rub at the heels , George stuffed his rags in a box , set Mr. Theo 's foot on the chair-rest and took the boot-stand away . " I would n't much care if she did rope me in , " said Mr. Theo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  lots of poise and charm , and she 's got a fine place in Memphis society . " " You serious about er ? " The smile drooped on Mr. Theo 's face . " Well , you ca n't call all these railroad fares to Memphis a light matter , can you ? " " She wo n't be wantin you to move to Memphis ? " asked Mr .. Jimmy , as he dusted a cloud of powder on the neck . " That 's such a big cotton-trading center ... " " No-o-o , " ? deliberately ? " it all depends on whether ? " Mr .. Theo broke off , and then exclaimed , " Say ! I have n't got er yet ! ' What 's the idea ! " The two barbers gleefully began to kid him . " But you said it was serious . " " Well , it is . That is  --  well , you see , I never did much in my life but sell cotton . As a married man , maybe I could get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , to the people . "  | " Like  --  politics , maybe ? " suggested Mr. Bostwick . " Well  --  you know a settled family man 's better fitted for public life . " MT . Jimmy ran the final combing through his hair and switched off the cloth . " Really goin into politics , huh ? " he asked seriously . Mr. Theo got out of the chair and adjusted his starched collar and broad tie before the mirror . The contorting of his neck and chin in the process warped his words . " Oh , I never thought of that till after I met Mrs. Tindall . She  --  uh  --  said I had the makings . . . Course , there 's lots o fine women right here , if I was jus tryin to find a wife . Mrs. Tindall 's got connections and ? this is all on the Q.T. , you know . " George whisked Mr. Theo 's back and held his coat . He moved like an automaton . His face was fixed but his eyes darted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the change from his bill and Mr. Theo smoothed his mustaches , set his hat , drew on his gloves , took his cane and , with a general good-bye , left . With dignity , thought George furiously , as he waited stiffly beside the hat rack . When the door had closed , the two barbers snickered . " By God ! " cried Mr. Bostwick . " What was that you pulled about not knowin what it means to live with a woman ? " Mr. Jimmy whooped softly . " Married woman , I meant . One you got at the altar . " " An see every night whether you want to or not ! " George was suddenly , hurriedly , walking to the door . " George ! " called Mr. Jimmy , " where you goin ? " George opened the door without answering or turning . " Come back here , boy ! Where you goin ? " shouted Mr. Jimmy . A strange voice was saying , " To get some mo shoe polish ... " and then the closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily down the street . When he caught up with Mr. Theo , he followed like a stalking animal . He surveyed the man from head to foot , not with the mild curiosity he had felt years before , but with the puzzled hunger of endless questions which rolled in like a series of ripples but never shaped into one great driving wave . His jaws rattled as he lingered against a wall while Mr. Theo stopped a few minutes to greet a friend . When the white man moved on , George was drawn along in blind fascination . Mr. Theo went into a store ,  | and George , waiting in the cold dampness , remembered that he had no coat on . Mr. Theo emerged , looking at a big gold watch , and George trailed again . But now the angry magnetism had less intensity . He followed not from compulsion but from indecision . They reached the railway depot and Mr. Theo went inside and bought a ticket . George , thoroughly chilled , peeping through the grimy windows , said to himself that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming in and he could n't leave . Mr. Theo , lugging a heavy bag he must have left earlier with the ticket agent , came from the waiting room . " Boy , " he said , lipping his cigar to one corner of his mouth , " carry this grip on the coach for me  --  will you . " " Yessuh . " George took the bag , because the " will you " was a perfunctory way of thanking him , which allowed no denial . Mr. Theo followed him on board the train . As he placed his hat and cane in the overhead rack , he said , " Ai n't you the boy from the barber shop ? " " Yessuh . " " Thought you looked the same . Live on Rosson Row , do n't you ? " In the brief meeting of their eyes , before George in shame and loathing turned his to the floor , he recognized a sadness and loneliness that had confronted him so often for so many months . " Well  --  thanks , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window . George retreated slowly down the aisle , quivering with undirected , unanalyzable emotions . May 's father  --  Miss Lucy 's man ? no , her husband , any way you looked at it , the way his people looked at it , because what was a marriage , aside from the preacher 's words , the ceremony ? The real ceremony was between the two , without any preacher or any words . Twenty-odd years Miss Lucy 's husband , who could make her cry and could hurt May ; but a husband who could simply go away and get married to a white woman . And George could n't do anything at all ? could n't strike him , spit on him or refuse to carry his bag . He could n't even say anything . Oh no , he could . He did . " Yessuh. "  | 17 " What you doin home so early ? " Annie asked . " You gon na be here for supper ? " At George 's answer , she seemed to grumble silently , or almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pot lids and shuffling of pans on the stove was a little more noisy and intentional than usual . When she set four places on the table , he asked the reason . " Mr. Johnson 's comin to supper , " she told him . " You gone so much you don hardly know im , I guess . " From his side of the hearth , Columbus glanced pointedly at George ; and later , when the food was almost ready , with a jerk of his head , he called George 's attention to their mother 's lastminute primpings before the glass above the dresser  --  the brushing back of stray wisps of hair , the removal of her apron , the adjustment of her dress at the yoke , the bosom , the waist . She tried to fasten the strand of green and gold beads around her neck but at last had to call Columbus to help her . When Tobe came in , Annie welcomed him with a formal cordiality that was new to George . Even Tobe 's manner  --  though George had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit that was too snug on his muscular frame , he gave the appearance of trying to reduce his bulk so that other people would have some room . His large eyes , overarched by surprisingly slender brows , flashed brightly from his broad rugged face and matched the good humor that his smiling mouth invited . In spite of his resentment , George could n't help responding to this radiating liveliness , so unlike his father 's fitfully joyous , often brooding , temper . As soon as his scorn rose jealously at seeing Tobe present a box of chocolates to Annie , it subsided into a conflicting pleasure when Tobe shook his hand in the customary forceless interlocking of palms . The handshake suggested not elder and junior , nor parent and child , but equals ; as did Tobe 's interest in his job and in Columbus ' job and his whole manner , all his talk and glances and movements , during supper .. Though he insisted to himself , after they had eaten , that he should leave  | them , in disgust with their middle-aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intrusion into their family , he could n't summon the initiative . He and Columbus played Lotto with them for a while , on the cleared table , and continued listlessly after they had stopped , when Annie said she could n't concentrate any longer , and had moved their chairs to the other side of the hearth . Listening to their voices dropping lower and lower , broken with soft laughs and giggles , George felt ashamed to look toward them . Like Columbus , he kept his eyes fixed on the Lotto board and stubbornly played on . Each time he came home to spend the evening , Annie increased his sense of unwelcomeness . " What 's the matter you don run aroun no mo like you used to ? Used to be rantin aroun ev'y night , an now you come home an sulk like you got the mulligrubs . " George would explain in mumbles that he did n't have many places to go these days , and ask if Tobe was coming by . But Tobe did n't call every night . Sometimes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ai n't e a fine man ? " " I ai n't got nothin again ' im , " George replied . " He so good , an sweet-natured . " " You ack like you in love with im . You both ack like you all the time spoonin . " Annie smiled happily . " Ai n't nothin wrong with that , is the ' ? " " He got a wife . " " So you been inquirin aroun , huh ? " she remarked coyly . " He had a wife . She run off to the No'th with a man years ago . Far as that go , I got a  --  husban too . I used to have . " " Yeah . What about Pa ? " George asked tensely , unable to look at his mother . But when she did n't answer , he gradually raised his eyes and saw that the happiness was gone from her face . " I loves yo pa , George , " she said plaintively . " He the one I truly loves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e ai n't comin back . I gets lonesome , an it ai n't the same as jus havin you an Columbus here . I gets lonesome fo somebody as needs me . You boys gon be leavin me soon  --  gettin married an all . I hear tell bout you an Miss Lucy 's gal . " Her face was slowly brightening , and now she darted a smile at him . " But Tobe 's real good , " she went on . " He so much like yo pa . He got is sweet talk an sweet  | actin . Ai n't nothing downright mean in im . He ai n't aimin to hurt yo pa . Or you boys either . He jus lonesome too . " Shortly afterward , Annie told the boys she had bought a divorce paper . " I didn ' want a commit no sin , " she explained to their silent questioning . " Not again ' the Lord or you chillun or Henry . Me an Tobe talk about it a lot an e say e try to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells folks a revorce paper , so I goes an buys one . " She produced a small document , with lines of large swirly fancy type at the top , rather like Lincoln 's school certificate , George thought , and more lines of small type below , with two blank spaces in which her name and Henry 's were inscribed in blue ink and the date , " December 19 , 1908 , " at the bottom , flanked by a snippet of blue ribbon caught under red sealing wax . George glanced at its official appearance but did n't bother to read it . As he began to put on his mackinaw and cap , Annie went anxiously to him . " You ai n't mad , George ? Cause I did it ? " " No , Ma , " he said , facing the door and stubbornly buttoning his coat . " I jus wanted to do somethin  --  go somewhere . I jus feel ? " But he could n't tell her how he felt  --  that by putting his father away from their home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence ever could . He went to Bucky Miller 's house , hoping to find companionship , someone to say words over his feelings , words that might comfort them or antagonize him so that he could in protest deny them . But no one was home . His chagrin over Annie swiftly changed to anger that whispered that Bucky was with May and he 'd better go right over to Miss Lucy 's and let them both see how unfairly they had treated him . But by the time he was climbing the steps up the clay bank , he had calmed down and was devising ways of making his visit seem casual . Miss Lucy answered his knock . No one else was in the room and George stood hesitantly while Miss Lucy hurried to the fire and warmed her hands . " Ai n't May here ? " he asked . " She was took to a little party . Wo n't you set down an get the chill off'n you , George ? " Miss Lucy sank onto her favorite rushbottomed rocker , her full thighs now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't move but , unsatisfied , un-  | comfortable , seeming almost dazed , continued to stare into the flames , Miss Lucy pursued , " I-Iow 's Miss Annie ? " George stirred from his reverie . " Oh  --  she 's tol'able . " " Well , set down , George . " Automatically , he slid onto a chair . " I was jus down to see Bucky Miller , an I thought I 'd step by an see you an May . " " Sho sorry she ai n't here . I 'd a whole lot rather she went out with you , though , than some folks ' at comes round here . I don like to see er get mixed up with no common niggers . " She rubbed a hand over her cheeks and lifted her eyebrows a moment as if to relax her face . Then she drooped slightly and her hands fell to her lap . " You a good boy , George . You got good folks , good blood . Folks that knows how to get along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have no troubles . " An angry frustration surged inside George , making him forget May in the recollection of Mr. Theo boarding the train . Miss Lucy knew all about getting along good too , did n't she ? Yeah , her white man leaving her to get married . Why did n't she feel any resentment ? She must know  --  she must hate  --  what they did to her , the way he did when he let himself think . And Lincoln ? what would the white folks do to him at length ? And Cora  --  what they had already done to her . And to his father , gone , divorced by Annie  --  to all of them , all of them . Why could Miss Lucy talk about knowing your place when what she really knew , must know , was hate , contempt , disgust , for all the whites and most of all for Mr. Theo ? Why should n't she shoot him ? Why did n't he himself , George , a man , twenty years old , react the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of petty incidents that ate and ate at his conscience , his energy , his ambition till nothing was left but a longing for pleasure ? It was that longing that got his pa into the mess with Luella  --  that was why he could blame the whites  --  they had created it as his only possible goal in life . George 's only goal , too . But he could do nothing  --  nothing calm and thought out  --  nothing but chafe and seethe ; and try to wipe it away with pleasure . He became conscious that Miss Lucy was still talking , musingly , and he tried to focus on her words . " ... makes me real scared about Lincoln . But I don have to worry bout May . She got good common sense an book learnin an manners . You got em too , George . Tha 's why she likes you , even if'n you cai n't see it . "  | Maybe it was the lowering of her voice at the last sentence that suggested it , but suddenly George was overwhelmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in this room  --  with Bucky  --  when he knocked . They must have fled to the bedroom , where they now sat tensely silent , waiting for him to go . He thought he heard a sound from that direction and , rising as in reflex , took a step toward the door . Puzzled , Miss Lucy broke off her monologue and watched . Finally she said , " George  --  you want somethin ? " He jerked about . " No , ma'am , " he said , with a sense of guilt but with a conviction that May and Bucky must be in the other room . He could endure it no longer , and in a stupidly loud voice asked , " Ai n't May here ? " " Why , no , I told you she done gone to a party . " George moved moodily to the front door , saying , " I got to go . " Outside on the plank walk , he could n't say what had prompted his actions . He seemed to perform like a dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking he heard laughter seeping from the house . He hurried away through the night toward the northern neighborhood of Ashton . If he just had somebody to talk to  --  somebody young , somebody to get his mind off the whole mess . If he only knew where the party was , he 'd go there and find May . If he only knew that Bucky was really with her . Maybe Bucky 's friend , Miss Duncan , would know where they were ... . When he found her house , Miss Duncan was delighted to see him , and scurried her aunt , with whom she lived , into another room . Before he could explain what he wanted , she had his mackinaw by the collar , pulling it down . " Wiggle yo arms , boy , " she cried . " How 'm I gon na get you out o this thing if you don he'p ? " Slightly vexed that his purposes were being diverted , but somewhat consoled by the presence of someone young , he twisted out of his coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I ai n't very fixed up , " she interrupted , flicking her housedress and simpering . " I was n't expectin no gentlemen callers . I 'll go spnice up some . " " No , do n't do that . I ai n't gon na stay a minute . " Shc rubbed her hand along his shoulder , and pressed him into a scat . " I 'll be right back . You jus set here an get warm through . " With a twinkling glance , she was gone .  | He did n't need to survey the room to know that it was almost exactly like the one he lived in . There was even the familiar stack of some white family 's laundry on the foot of the crowding bed . A dim lamp , burning on a table , helped the fire to light the calendars on the walls and pick the shamble of furniture from the gloom . He must get away , back to Miss Lucy 's , though he could n't go inside . He must know who was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , unobserved , and see who brought her home . He stood up , listening carefully for sounds from the other room , and then grabbed his mackinaw . " I got a go , Miss Duncan , " he said to the bedroom door . " I got a find Bucky Miller . I thought you might know ? " A whining protest came through the panels : " He step out with a high yeller lots now . " " Do n't get dressed up . I got a go . His ma 's sick an I jus got a find him . " IIc wheeled away , fumbling his arms into the mackinaw , but he was too late . Miss Duncan flung open the door and caught his arm . She had put on the same green silk dress she wore to the dance , and had powdered her face and sprayed on cologne . " Now take that thing off , " she scolded , as she pulled the mackinaw down again . Dropping it on a chair , she plucked at the shoulders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have to hook me up , Georgie . Aunt Tempie 's gone to bed . " He gazed in confusion at the long V of her back , defined by the gaping folds of green . She had nothing on under the dress , and the rounding of her shoulders and the sweep of her spine to the waist caught up soft lusters from the amber light . " I cai n't ? " he began . " Jus hook the top one , so 's it wo n't fall off , " she murmured . He pressed the hook through the eye with trembling fingers . The odor of the cologne mixed with the warmth of her body tingled in his nose . " I got a see Bucky , Miss Duncan , " he begged . " Aw , whadda you want a go fo ? I ai n't seen Bucky in a week . It 's too cold to look fo him . We 'll have fun here , uh ? You gon na stay here with yo jelly roll , ai n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , softly , brushed his leg with her thighs . She blew out the lamp and there was only firelight glinting .  | While she chatted , quietly flirtatious , and occasionally reached out to pat his neck or knee , George listened and replied hypnotically . He kept trying to think of May and how he could leave Miss Duncan , but the more he tried , the feebler grew his efforts and the angrier grew his thoughts at making the effort . It was all May 's fault anyway . Why was n't she at home ? Why had she gone out with a stinker like Bucky ? Why did she do this to him ? Then Miss Duncan was asking him to help her pack the laundry so she could deliver it early the next day . He brought the big flat rectangular basket to the bed , and they laid the clothes in it and he set it on the floor . When he straightened , he saw that Miss Duncan had unfastened the top hook of her dress , and it was crumpling off her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Georgie ? " she whispered , and drawing an arm from the sleeve , extended it toward him . At closing time for the barber shop , George was drawing down the green shades on the sweaty front windows when the drops of moisture , reflecting the outside lights , made him think of the dazzling frosty display windows of McLain 's store . How he would enjoy buying a gift from all that array of finery  --  a gift for May , which he could bring to her tonight , tomorrow , so he could watch her eyes shine on him their thanks . But a gift from McLain 's would be expensive ; over and over he told himself that the lace cuffs or the handkerchief he had admired in the window would cost more than he could afford . And as he had done so often during the past days , he asked himself again why he should give her anything at all . Because I like her , he would then explain ; because she 's nice to me , and I want her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so , with that sad tenderness , like some kind of warm flood of love pouring over me , not like Miss Duncan 's mechanical love , not having to touch , even , but just loving through looking so I shiver and my heart pumps and I breathe deep and shaky and feel happy and sad and not lonesome and not alone . But some hidden attitude that he could n't think of in that way , altogether and frankly , kept pushing up the notion that he was jealous of May and was willing to spend money to counteract it ; that he  | was ashamed of that night with Miss Duncan and hoped to atone for it ; that . . . But he would n't let the ideas emerge any further ; he was willing to admit that much . If he had n't been jealous he 'd have had more sense than to get snared when he did n't really want to . Miss Duncan , while helping him achieve part of his desire  --  the unimportant part , it seemed now  --  had somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening , he fumed at Miss Duncan , because she had shown him that his power to choose or refuse a favor was gone ; and equally he fumed at May , because by confusing him with jealousy , she had undermined that power . And though he kept repeating that he did n't like Miss Duncan , sometimes when he thought of May and how she might be out with some other fellow , with Bucky , with who knows what scalawag , he would curse in exasperation and recall how , for a while at Miss Duncan 's , lie had forgotten her . But he would also recall how May sprang at once into his guilty thoughts as he left the bed , and followed him out under the sleeping sky and past the unchanged trees and houses and over the invisible alley ruts , and seemed to become two faces ? one the one that wept on the pasture road when he taunted her and one the one that enveloped him nowadays in the warmth of a glance  --  condemning , forgiving , slain and born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of Rosson Row . A dim light still burned in May 's house . George had crawled up the bank across the road and lay on the stubbles , watching the window while the cold penetrated his clothing and bit his flesh . For an hour he must have kept his vigil , shivering and yet stiff , without once considering his reasons ; but for all his discomfort , he felt calmer . He saw a shadow sweep across the window  --  Miss Lucy 's ? ? and shortly afterward the house went dark . Crossing town , he was stopped by a deputy sheriff , suddenly stepping from a black passage . " What you doin out so late , boy ? " Been to sit with his sick aunt , he lied . " Why you tremblin so ? Been up to some devilment , I guess . " The deputy searched George 's pockets , and finding nothing incriminating , sent him on . " Best not to be stayin out so late at night . Get into trouble . " George felt he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , and even crazier for acting the way he did about May . But he enjoyed being crazy about May . She asked nothing ,  | but he wanted to give something , and the delight of it swelled in him with a sensation that must be like what flower buds feel , bursting open hungry for the sun . After he had finished cleaning the shop , he could go look at the gifts in McLain 's snowy cases and dream of giving one to May . He gathered up the three brass spittoons and bore them to the rear of the store where he emptied them into the rusty toilet bowl of the lean-to . He swept up bits of lint and hair , nudging the spittoons with his toe , from the path of the broom . Mr. Bostwick was folding the aprons and cloths and straightening the shelves of gaudy , personally embossed shaving mugs . Mr. Harper stood at the cash register counting the day 's receipts . Pausing a second before the mirror , George raked his comb through his pomaded hair  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehead  --  then his square face dipped from the mirror as he gathered the soiled towels from baskets and stuffed them into a laundry bag . The white men had on their coats when he returned from the laundry closet . All lights were out but one , and they were ready to leave . " Here y'are , George . Salary ? " Mr. Jimmy poured the coins into George 's cupped palm " ? an fifty cents extra . Christmas present ! " " Thank you , suh , I sho ' preciates it . " " You can get something for yo gal now , " said Mr. Bostwick . " What you gon na get her ? " asked Mr. Jimmy . " I ' xpect he 'll get some of those newfangled bloomers that come off easy , " said Mr. Bostwick , snickering . " That 'd be just the thing , " agreed Mr. Jimmy jovially . " Wo n't never stop you from gettin that ole poontang , huh , George ? " George 's body tautened and he felt a dizzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he realized that they did n't know how he felt about May , and in their cold ignorance were unaware of giving any insult . On the sidewalk , he pulled on his coat and cap , while the men locked the shop , and lingered until they were respectably ahead of him before sauntering toward McLain 's store . Between the two tempting display windows , he hesitated , wondering if he were doing right , and then timidly entered . The counters were in a confusion of bright articles tossed helter-  | skelter , and the two narrow aisles were milling with white people . For a moment he gave himself over to the fascination of the skeleton canopy of red and green streamers above , and the pleated perforated Chinese fabrications through which the overhead delivery basket swished to the cashier 's balcony . He slowly moved among the crowd , being extra-cautious not to touch even their garments with his own , and at last , baffled , stopped beside a counter where a lady was making a purchase . A woman 's voice asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , his mouth opened with silence , and then he murmured , " A present . " " What kind ? " the clerk inquired . " A hankchuf , I reckon , " he said weakly , lowering his eyes in embarrassment . " Talk louder , boy , I ca n't hear what you 're saying . " " A  --  a hankchuf , " he said more loudly , still without lifting his head . Iie heard the rattle of opening drawers , the buzz of voices , the high hum and click of the cash basket coasting along its wire . The silver coins in his pocket were sweaty in his fist , and he drew out his hands , but not daring to rest them on the glass case , closed one on the other at his waist . At his left , arrayed in varnished drawers beneath the glass , were piles of delicate silk handkerchiefs . The clerk had not opened that case . And then the clerk 's serge skirt entered his field of vision , and a box slid before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were rather plain handkerchiefs ; they were for me , he decided . " I wanted a lad  --  a woman 's hankchuf  --  fo a present , " he said . " Well , why n't you say so ? " grumbled the clerk . He was aware now that two ladies stood nearby watching him with indignant eyes and stiffened countenances . " Where do they get the money ? " sighed the lady . The clerk opened a box of cambric and lace handkerchiefs , lifted one out and spread it on her fingers . " These are fifty cents , " she said . " How much is them ? " he asked , and pointed to the silk ones below . With a vexed look , she replied , " This blue one is one-fifty and the flesh is two dollars . "  | That was what he wanted , the blue silk with pale lace and embroidered rosebuds in the corner . The clerk pulled out the drawer and set it on the counter . With the silk so close , so inviting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caressing it in pantomime , at which the clerk , with a faint contraction of her fingers on the drawer , unmistakable in meaning , twitched it , and George 's hand recoiled. " ... simply can not get a clerk , " the woman behind him was muttering . " I did n't know Mr. McLain was catering to them . " " Just a minute , Mrs. Wicksam , " consoled the clerk , and then said to George : " Well , do you want one ? I ca n't wait all night . " " The blue one , " said George . Pulling the money out , he put three half dollars on the glass shelf . " What 's that smell ? " asked a woman . " It 's that nigger , " said another , not too softly . " Oh . Might know it . Smell em a mile . " The clerk had been wrapping his purchase in holly-covered paper , when she suddenly looked at him with what George thought in his blurred humiliation might be a smile  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those women too . " Oh  --  a gift ? " she murmured , and caught up a silver box from the shelf behind her to hold the handkerchief . He felt she had done something very special for him , had gone out of her way  --  who knows , even dangerously ? ? but he was unable to thank her , and edged through the crowd with his eyes lowered . If those white bastards did n't have tin-lined bathtubs in heated rooms , and powder and perfume , and had to work at manual labor and wash their own clothes , they 'd smell too , he comforted himself , so as to avoid more serious thoughts . But if he was expecting to see May that night , right now without going home , and her so much like white folks in lots of ways , maybe she would n't like his smell any more than the ladies in the store . Well , why should anyone ? He did n't like it himself ; but this was wintertime and it was four days since he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to May 's tomorrow and wish them a Merry Christmas . And to see Aunt Martha , and to the Murchisons ' with Columbus  --  they would be giving them some presents , as usual , and might even throw in a slug of whiskey . When he reached home , he found his mother standing on a chair before the mantel and trying to festoon some holly and  | candle-scorched tinsel ropes above the clock . Columbus was steadying the chair and handing up branches to her . " We gon na have a party tonight , George , " Annie said gaily , without turning from the swags she was hanging . " See all the fixins ? Mistletoe , an apples to roast an corn to pop , an Tobe gon na bring some liquor , an Mamie gon come , an Aunt Martha an . . . There  --  that 's study now . " Holding her balance on Columbus ' shoulder , she squatted and clumped from the chair to the floor . She whisked her skirts once and then , seizing George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon celebrate with us , honey ? " George was too taken aback by the sudden show of affection to answer . " What 's that you got ? " she went on . He twisted the package , looking dubiously at it , and stammered . " Bet it 's a present fo some ole gal , " said Columbus glumly . " Who you givin a present to , an slightin me ? " teased Annie , and at once changed the subject again . " Look at this here cake Miz Mu'chison sent us  --  half a fruit cake an half a Lady Baltimo ' . We gon have a real whang-dang party . You gon stay , ai n't you ? " " I don know , " he said . " I was gon take this present . " " Oh yeah , " Annie continued to shift into new arrangements the platters and glasses and plates on the table . " Where to , George ? " " Some ole cat , like as not , " scoffed Columbus , good-naturedly . Dropping the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shut up , damn yo hide ! You keep yo mealy-mouth out o my business . " " Boys . . . " Annie had quickly intervened , and was caressing , soothingly , George 's shoulders . " He jus jokin . What you take im so serious fo ? " She picked up the handkerchief box and handed it to him . " He had n't ought a talk that away . He don know where I 'm goin , an e low-rate em . " George stroked the box , as if to smooth out any wrinkles in its covering . " You want a see it , Ma ? " he asked , brightly , dismissing his anger and holding out the box . " I 'm takin it to Miss Lucy 's . " Annie laughed her high liquid laugh . " Courtin the cow to get the calf ! " she cried .  | " Aw . . . " drawled George with a grin . " I mean to Miss Lucy 's house . It 's fo May . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , do n't open it . They 's comin tonight too , so we can all see it then . " " They is ? " " Yeah , comin with Aunt Martha . So get yo nice clothes on . You too , C'lumbus . We ai n't gon eat but a handout  --  ai n't got time to cook up a lot an have comp'ny too . " " I got a wash myself , " said George , strangely wistful , " if the 's gon be a party . " " Well , git in that kitchen an bathe good an git dressed . They be here fo we git good an ready . You too , C'lumbus . Some water b'ilin on the stove , but ai n't no time to heat mo . " On the floor beside the kitchen range , George set the zinc washtub and partly filled it with cold water before emptying into it the kettles on the stove . He had started unbuttoning his shirt when he noticed Columbus standing silently by the door . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Columbus said , " I did n't mean it bad . " " I knows you did n't , " said George . He dropped his hand toward the steaming tub . " You want a go first ? " Columbus shook his head and smiled slightly . " You go on . " Having stripped off his clothes , George crammed himself into the tub , feet bent up toward his shins , knees almost under his chin , the rim cutting into his back , and swabbed himself rapidly with yellow laundry soap . In the cold air that seeped through cracks in the wall , so that the stove never heated the room thoroughly , little strings of vapor floated off his wet body . While he was drying , Columbus began to undress and just as they were exchanging places , from tub to floor , Annie came in . " What 's takin y'all so long ? " she cried , and swatting Columbus on the behind , added , " Git down in that water ! I 'll wash yo top part quick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs she spanked his bottom too , and said , " Go git yo shirt on ! " " Ma ! " exclaimed George , in outraged laughter , " you ack like you think we still little kids ! " Columbus grinned back at him , as George ran , prancing eekily over the cold boards , to get fresh clothes .  | They had hardly finished supper , eating from plates held in their hands , when Mamie James came in . " Land 's sake , " gasped Annie , scrambling up to hide the supper dishes . " Is it time ? Is Tobe with you ? " Mamie held out a letter . " It 's from Silas . I came early so 's George could read it to me . " Obviously delighted with it , she crossed proudly to George . " Will you , please ? " " Yessum , " he answered . " But you know I ai n't very good at it . " " I been totin it since mornin , but ai n't nobody else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , Annie broke in , " Is Tobe comin here right now ? " " Now hol ' yo potato , Annie , " chided Mamie . " He jus got home this minute . He be here after while . " She hovered over George 's shoulder , gazing fondly at the strange lines on the sheets of paper in his hand , and waiting impatiently for him to tell her what they meant . " Can you see all right , George ? What do e say ? " By the ruddy light from the hearth , George began to read jerkily , stumbling over words here and there and sometimes making up a word where he could n't decipher the writing . Dear Ma , how are you ? I 'm fine but had a cold last month . The weather has been bad and lots of snow and ice and real cold . I am hoping this will reach you in time for Xmas . I wish I could send you something real nice from up here , but you know how it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't know how long that will last , unless Mr. Harlan will help me out some more . But do n't worry about inc as everything is all right . Tell Miss Annie I have n't any news of her daughter at this time .. . In the hushed group , Annie 's tension could now be felt , increasing so that it became almost visible . She had listened , up to this point , with a look of benign satisfaction in Mamie 's pleasure , but now , with her immediate joy distracted by memories , her features clouded with a pathetic , stoical eagerness . Slowly her hands folded together , and in a sad voice , she said , " Go on , George . What else ? " After a quick , concerned glance at her , George returned to the letter , picking up where his finger had kept the place and following each line with his nail . She was working days in a cafe , like I  | wrote you , and singing at night in a cabaret . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe for coffee , but now she has gone . The man there said she quit , not fired . So I went to her cabaret to find out . I know Miss Annie would want to know . And they said she had quit there too , and gone off with a piano player . They thought maybe they went to Detroit but do n't know . Maybe I 'll hear later . She will be all right though , as she has caught on fine to city ways and the North , and she is a real good singer . The cabaret folks were real put out that she left them . George paused , for his mother was quietly sniffling , with her head bent so that no one would see her tears . " Now , Annie , don fret , " said Mamie tenderly . " She 'll come back . " But Annie despondently shook her head . " We wo n't never hear no mo o Cora . She done plumb gone now  --  plumb gone . I feel it in my bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I must stop now , Mama , read George . Please try to get Miss Annie 's son to write again for you . It 's so long since that letter and I do n't know ever if you get sick or anything . Give him my thanks for doing this , which is a very fine thing and means so much to us . It is a help to our people that only a few can give right now . So thank him and tell him to study hard , because every step up is harder than the last . So Merry Xmas , Mama , and love from your son , Silas James . When he finished , they all sat meditating , but especially George , who was struck by the passage referring to himself . It had never occurred to him that his ability to read and write , though crudely , could be thought of as much more than a trick . ' I'hen it was important , as May had said ; it did help all his people , as Silas wrote  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pride quivering in him . If only his father could hear that letter ! But quickly he remembered that there would never be for him those next higher , harder steps , for he had given up school . Mamie slipped the sheets from his fingers and folded them into the envelope . " Will you read it to me again tomorrow ? " she pleaded . " I ca n't get it all set in my head at one time . " " Yessum , if you want me to , " answered George amiably . " Well ? " sighed Annie as she got to her feet . Flicking a finger across her moist eyelids , as if to end the whole thing , she began a last-minute tidying of the room before the guests arrived .  | Tobe Johnson was the first to come , entering with boisterous holiday greetings , two bottles of gin and several small gift packages . He and Annie started concocting a pitcher full of punch , combining the gin and grape juice . George saw Tobe slide his arm about Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back . She must have told him the news of Cora . Then Annie started passing jelly glasses of punch as Tobe poured . " I 'm warnin you , this here stuff 's strong as a mule , " said Annie . " Now le ' me see " ? gravely ponderous , as she halted before Columbus ? " is you old enough to sample this ? " " I done had some fo now , " said Columbus . " C'umbus ! You too little to be guzzlin liquor ! " " He ai n't a baby , Ma , " said George . " Besides , you done offered im some . " " Go on , Annie , " the others urged . " He done growed up . You cai n't keep im in diapers all is life . " With a warning rap on the door , unheard in the clamor , Aunt Martha had come in and , yelling greetings , shoved a large box into Annie 's arms . Together they emptied it onto the table of refreshments , setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and date candy , a tiny angel 's food cake , mixed unhulled nuts and dried fruits . " Been caterin fo Miz Ford 's big party , " said Aunt Martha , " an she gi ' me some o the ' freshments . An then I jus threw in the rest . Almos threw in a whole turkey , I 'm tellin you , the ' was so much vittles lyin aroun her kitchen . " She saw Tobe tinkering with the punch and nudged him with her elbow . " Gi ' me some o that joy-juice , Tobe , " she said and giggled . " Where 's Miss Lucy ? " several voices were asking . " She say she don feel like comin , " said Aunt Martha , setting a shrewd eye on George . " Well , could n't May ? ? " he began . " She wanted to keep er ma comp'ny tonight . Miss Lucy gettin right poly , it look like . Bu-u-u-ut . . . " Aunt Martha sang the word on a long-drawn falling cadence and rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come later , bout the time er ma go to bed . " She sipped the punch , beamed in appreciation and settled her big form deep into a rocking chair . And again , the teasing cadence : " Tha-at i-i-i-is ... "  | " Marthy , you 's tormentin as a plaguy skeeter ! " " ... if she don have to cross town in the night by erself . " Pleased by the manifest anxiety and now , relaxation , she had produced in George , she took a deeper drink of the punch and hummed a staccato note . " Oh well , " boomed Tobe , catching the teasing spirit , " we can send C'lumbus after her . That right , sonny ? " Now Annie joined in . " Course , we could send George , but I ' low as he would n't want a go off an leave this here punch . " The others laughed hilariously , except George , who grinned sickly and squirmed slowly around to hide his face . " Aw , hush , Ma ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have to be a mighty pretty gal to get me way from good ole liquor ! " said Tobe . " You got yo gal an yo liquor both right here ! " cried Mamie , a trifle giddy from her one glass of punch . " Well , May ai n't very pretty , is she ? " joked Aunt Martha . " Anybody here think May 's pretty ? " " How bout you , George ? " Before George could reply , Columbus spoke up , perhaps from submerged loyalty , but certainly in oblivion of the general air of the moment , " I does . She 's real pretty . " And suddenly , amid exclamations of amused amazement , the teasing was directed toward him . " Why , C'lumbus , I did n't know you ' as stuck on May ! " " Boy , you too young to have them notions . You ai n't hardly got peach fuzz on yo chin yet . " " IIeck , " pouted Columbus in the noise , " she 's George 's girl . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . An she 's sweet , too . " " You don mean you let George beat yo time ! " " George don ack like e cares nothin about her . He ai n't even said she 's pretty . " " Have some mo punch , Miss Mamie ? " asked Annie , holding out the pitcher . " Oooh , Lawsy , I think I 'm tipsy now ! " " Give George some punch . He rather have it than May , looks like . " " Aw , y'all ack real crazy , " said George moodily . " Yeah , I want some mo . " He put out his glass toward his mother .  | Then suddenly a great maternal protectiveness poured out of Annie . " Y'all all stop pesterin my boy , now . He 's all right , an he know what he thinks . " She noticed the extended glass . " Naw , you don need no mo if you goin to Miss Lucy 's . I don want you turnin up there like as not drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " George 'll be skeered to walk in the dark with May , " said Tobe , unwilling to let the sport end . " Wo n't you , George ? Why , she might even jump up in yo arms an kiss you . " But at George 's frown , he added seriously , " Hope she do , You deserves it , George . " Tobe slapped him on the back . " Now get on yo coat an go , " insisted Annie . " She puttin on a real fetchin dress , " said Aunt Martha enthusiastically . " If'n it don fetch you to a ma'iage , you ai n't no son o Henry . " There was a tight hush for a second . Then Annie said brightly , " Hurry up , George . An give Miss Lucy our Chris'mas wishes . " " Leave me take my present , " said George . " Aw naw ! " cried Annie . " You give it to er there an she 'll sho kiss you . You wait 'll you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They all shouted messages to Miss Lucy , and lightheartedly , George hastened toward Rosson Row . 18 It had seemed inevitable , and hence held no surprise for George , that he should come home one evening and discover that Tobe Johnson had moved in . Annie 's " divorce paper " was enough to foreshadow it ; and he , like Columbus , kept his reactions to himself . Now that it was done , and they both had a new father  --  for to all the neighbors Annie became Miz Johnson at once  --  they did not even mention their feelings to each other . The genial manner which Tobe had shown proved not to be faked , and he maintained toward them all the same attitude to  | which their resistance had yielded during his courtship . These days the house seemed more relaxed , more pleasant , and often merry . Annie no longer worried about money or where George spent his evenings ; Columbus seemed to stop brooding about his absent father  --  but then , as George had recently realized , Columbus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pieced together Tobe 's background , as the fireman , reminiscing with Annie , told of incidents he remembered or had heard from his parents . Their childhood experiences of slavery were fairly similar  --  a matter of senses with no awareness of their legal subjugation until it was behind them and they were growing up . When the war was over , Tobe , though nine years old , was still wearing a shirttail of gunny sacks . His father sneaked into the master 's house before they left the plantation and stole a little boy 's suit for him and a dress for his mother . They headed for Ohio where his father , who was a carpenter and a fair hand at cabinetmaking , hoped to find work . Tobe was put in school to get an education as was proper , but all the white children stared at him and teased him and he could n't keep his mind on the lessons . Once the teacher gave each pupil a poem to learn for the closing exercises in spring and Tobe was to elocute , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " But when the ceremony began , and all the parents were sitting there to admire , somehow he could n't bring himself to say the lines . The schoolmistress had called his name but he did n't budge . At last , when she touched his shoulder and nudged him forward , he thought the audience snickered , so he strode to the front of the stage and declaimed : " Up the hickory , down the pine , I split my britches right behind . " According to Tobe , his father and mother were so humiliated they moved to another town . But it was n't altogether that , for they had to move again because his father could n't find enough work to make a living . He put up a sign to repair furniture and ' robe , having given up school as useless , began to learn the trade . His mother took a job in a restaurant as dishwasher . She began to want to come back to the South , and after years of increasing poverty and dissatisfaction , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , his father married again , and ' robe , like his brothers and sisters who were old enough , decided to strike out on his own .  | A new railroad was under construction in southern Mississippi , where a lumber boom was developing , and he worked there for two years . Then for a time he was in a sawmill and at last in the pine forests with a turpentine company . He was a box-chopper , and , with a left-handed partner , went from tree to tree in the drift line set by the woods rider , and one on each side cornered the sap pockets in the trunk with two axe strokes each . Try as they might , they could never match the pace set by the " high roller " who , when he had finished a hundred boxes , would sing out his boast : " Hear me , sinners ! Hear me ! I come here this mornin . . . " And the laggard choppers would chorus : " Oh yes ! " " To cut a hundred boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty cents fo my wife . . . " " Oh yes ! " " Fifty cents fo my baby . . . " " Oh yes ! " " Fifty cents fo myself . . . " " Oh yes ! " " Now I 'm gwine a howl ! " And his howl , augmented by all the others , would fairly rock the tall pines with a thunderous " YOW ! " But Tobe wanted a life more agreeable than the crudeness of the turpentine camp and soon he quit , wandered northward , took up with a woman on the way , married her  --  this part Tobe rather skimped in spite of Annie 's insistent curiosity  --  and at last reached Ashton and began working for the railroad . " Funny how I got started , " he told them once . " This man Hakes took me on to help build is new house , cause I know some carpenterin . I thought here 's another good white man , cause e gave me that job an asked did I want to work fo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He taught me a lot , sure , but then I found out he wanted me to be his  --  not jus is fireman , but is man . Wanted me to work at is home when I was n't on the engine an always throwin up to me how he got me the job . An en he started gettin touchy an accusin me o bein smart-aleck . Gon na push me out o the cab when the train 's agoin , an hit at me with a shovel . That banged on the coal tender when I ducked . But I did n't know what to do . If I complained they would n't believe it ; they 'd say I ' as lyin an I 'd lose my job . I ' as real glad when that man jumped out o the cab one day an tripped on a crosstie an fell right in front of a switch engine . An I ' as glad too I never complained , cause if I had , they 'd a said I pushed im out there . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | when the only customer left , Mr. Jimmy snatched up the weekly newspaper the postman had just delivered , and sank into a chair to read . For a few minutes all was quiet except for the crackling turn of the pages and Mr. Bostwick 's barely audible scraping as he shaved himself . Then Mr. Jimmy whistled a long note and cried , " Oh boy ! Here it is ! He 's done done it . " " What ? " inquired Mr. Bostwick nasally , as he pressed aside a nostril to trim his mustache . " Theo  --  done announced the wedding . " George listened carefully , but pretended to be unconcerned while Mr. Jimmy read the notice . But in the afternoon , with customers still sparse , most of them waiting for their regular Saturday visit , he took up the paper as if merely to pass the time . IIe had heard what the article said , but he felt impelled to see the names in print , as if he suspected Mr. Jimmy of leaving out the part about Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Ile glanced over the front page ? " HANGING DATE SET , BENEFIT BAND CONCERT , MASQUERADE PARTY AT SKATING RINK " ? and the second page of editorials and strange stuff . Then , fearing that hurry would betray him , he stared at the pictures on the third page  --  a long story called " Great Disasters " ? whatever that was ? " in Our Time . " The pictures all showed fire and smoke and frantic rushing crowds and toppling buildings , and were labeled with names he seldom recognized : " Holocaust in Iroquois Theatre in Chicago " ; " 500 Dead as Vesuvius Goes on Rampage " ; " Earthquake Destroys San Fransco " ; " Excursion Boat Capsizes . . . . " He turned the page after a while and looked at the drawings in the advertisements  --  ladies in frilly shirtwaists holding bottles called Wine of Cardui or Nadinola or Rangum Root Liniment ; a pail marked " Swift 's Cottolene " ; a bearded man 's face and a bottle of " Mexican Mustang Liniment for Lumbago , Rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swelled Head in poultry " ; a baby 's smiling face and " White 's Cream Vermifuge , the Guaranteed Worm Remedy . The Children 's Favorite Tonic " ; a round jar with big print beside it : " Piles upon top of piles of people have Piles , and DeWitt 's Witch Hazel Salve cures them . . . " ; and a bottle , described as " I ' . P.P. ( Prickly Ash , Poke Root and Potassium ) ? Positive cure for Syphilis , Scrofula , Blood Poison and Rheumatism . " His eyes  | merely flicked over other ads and he began apprehensively to scan the small personal items on the facing sheet . " The Novelty Club entertained on Tuesday with a pageant of a trip to the Mikado 's Kingdom . Mrs. R. X. McDonald , as the Empress , resplendent in jewels from her grandmother 's heirlooms , received in Oriental style , seated on a rich throne . " No . . . . " Entertains New Orleans Visitors . " No . . . . " Ladies ' Aid Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then he saw it : " Prominent Local Man to Wed . " It was all just as Mr. Jimmy had read it . At the final sentence , he felt guilty , as if the barbers knew what he was doing , and dared not lift his eyes . They trailed down the column : " Parcheesi , The Royal Game of India . No household complete , no home happy without it . " He turned to the back page , trying to make no noise , but Mr. Bostwick cut his eyes around with a smirking look . George hid again in the paper , his attention focused on a pistol . " A Smith &; Wesson Revolver will make a hole in a $10 bill . But it 's worth all you pay for it . Revolvers never disappoint . " Make a hole in a man , too , but was it worth the price ? Anyhow , he did n't have a ten-dollar bill . Slowly he dropped the weekly on the chair at his side . That night he went to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwelcome news , or whether , knowing already , she and Miss Lucy would be so unnerved that he 'd regret being there . His immediate sweeping look about the room , when May asked him in , gave him away . " Mama 's in er room , " said May . " She had some bad news . " " Yeah , it was in the paper , " he said , after a pause . " The paper ? " echoed May incredulously . " I mean , the wedding . " May began to laugh softly as she breathed , " Well ! " and George , out of uneasy sympathy , smiled with her . " Yeah , " said May reflectively , " folks like us do n't get in the papers unless we commit a crime . " " How 'd you know , May ? Did e come an tell Miss Lucy ? " " Oh , she 's known it a long time  --  known it was goin to happen . " " But she would n't do anything ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the question , but " I do n't know , " he said weakly . " I know what I want to do . I saw im one day ? " and he  | told of the day he helped Mr. Theo onto the train . " An all the time I wanted to kill im , and I could n't think how . I still want to , but I cai n't do it . " " But honey , it would n't do any good to anyone , would it ? Tha 's why you cai n't do it . You 'd be in trouble , an you 'd make Mama an me mo miz'able than ever . He 's my pa , you know . We got a think about that , cause there 's no way ever to forget it . " " I know you 're right , May . I would n't want to hurt you or Miss Lucy . I jus cai n't figure out why I can want to do something an then cai n't do it . I want a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an sass em back . But I cai n't do it . I 'm ? I 'm scared to , I guess . " " Tha 's not it , George . You 're jus actin proper  --  the way we got to act if we gon na get along with white folks . " " Oh , I know we 're all low-down , like they say . Ai n't got no sense an no decent thoughts an live like dogs an ? " " Tha 's not what I mean . I don know about who 's better an got mo sense an all that . We all jus do the way it 's fixed for us to do . They do too , cause they 're the boss . An cai n't none of us never change it , I reckon . " That constant echo  --  never  --  pressed deeper into his mind , but even as he thought They can change it , the despondency seemed to fade away almost at once , as if his familiarity with its repetition gave it a barely noticeable twinge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jus got a do the best we can the way they tell us to . But they would n't treat a white lady the way Mr. Theo treats Miss Lucy . Would n't nobody let im do that . " " Pa done as good as e could , I spec . He done the same as any other white man  --  maybe better . We all know it could n't be no different . " " But why ? " He knew it was a question he must not ask , even to his own race . " Jus because . Mama always knew some day he might go way , like this . Somehow I reckon we kind of expect it , Iike it ' as the way things have to be done . Mama do n't hold it against im . " " Yeah . " Her resignation offered no stimulus to his anger , and he relapsed into a moody calmness . Then , excitedly , at last he said , " But there ai n't anybody now to look after you all . Miss Lucy ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How you gon na live ? "  | May smiled wanly . " We 'll make out all right . " " I thought maybe if I  --  if me an you could  --  course I don make much money to speak of , but it might help . I mean , if we got married , I 'd want a help what I could . " He must have sounded very silly for suggesting that his salary would be of any use to them and very crass for offering it as a reason for marriage . His breath was coming short and quivery as he tried lamely to smooth over the botched proposal . " I could look fo a better payin job . But tha 's not the reason . I cai n't really say it right , May . I 've sort o thought about it a lot , but I never could tell how you had to say it . I want a marry you anyhow . But I want a help too . " " Thank you , George . I know how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Pa gave somethin to help out . Here . . . " She reached on the mantelpiece beside the photograph of Mr. Theo and drew down a letter . " You better read what e said . It came a couple o days ago . " George opened the sheet of paper . Dear Lucy , it said , It 's hard to write this . There must be some things to explain , but I do n't know what they are or how to explain them . Maybe you understand better than I do , and so I ought to say nothing at all . But I have to say something , and what I want to say , I ca n't . So do n't think that this which I have done  --  these enclosed papers ? comes from contempt or anything mean . It may be hard to , but try to think of it as done in sorrow , and love of you and our children . I do n't want any of you to ever suffer more than I have already caused you to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human help  --  but it 's the only thing I know . I 'm helpless myself , and weak . I 'd like to ask you a last favor , but maybe I have no right . I know you and your heart so well that I 'm sure you would consent . But if you denied it , I would know too that you have every reason on your side . If you can , please think of me now not as a wicked man , but as you used to know me . Theo . P.S. May can write and handle the papers . Burn this note at once . George looked up frowning . " It had a checkbook in Mama 's name with a big amount , and some kind of bonds or somethin Pa fixed up in Memphis , " explained May . " They pay some money in once in a while . There 'll be plenty fo Mama to live on all right . "  | " But tha 's like payin ' off  --  like ... " " Pa did n't mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like e said . We do need money , I guess . Anyhow we will . " " An Miss Lucy was n't mad ? She thought e done right ? " " She did n't say what she thought about how e acted . When I first read it to er , she jus cried an then she said , Do n't e write the purtiest letter ? ' An she wants to hear it over all the time . She thinks different from us in some ways . She don hate im . I don hate im either . " " It makes me feel funny , " said George . " It kind o makes me feel  --  sick . " " You mean it rattles yo mind about lovin me ? " asked May kindly , but facing him unabashedly . " You mean , if we don hate Pa an despise im for doin this , you don quite feel the way you did about me ? " " I don know what you gettin at , May . You got too much sense fo me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be in trouble an be hatin him . But you don need me , I guess . " He stared angrily at the picture of Mr. Theo , but was unable to transfer his anger , as he felt inclined to , to May or Miss Lucy . Everyone knew no good came of having to do with folks that had some white blood ; few would seek out a wife from among such people , and they sensed vague reasons for it  --  like this , say , when May could defend the white man , and Miss Lucy could go on loving him , even after he had degraded them . He had heard allusions to this restriction often in the past , but with the comments so general and the names indefinite , he had thought little of it . He could recollect that all the Negroes he knew liked these two women and respected them ; and also that long ago he had been able to taunt her with her white father . Because of his attachment to her , he must n't now fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he must overlook , out of love , her substitution of parental affection for the loathing that would have fed his own wish to loathe . So until he could forget much of this , he must n't talk to her any more . He turned slowly . " I better go , May . " She stopped him with a touch on the arm and the words : " I do need you , George . " He waited in a dull wonder . " But not because Pa did this . I want you to marry me . I want a marry soon . "  | His eyes filled with skittering alarm . " But I cai n't  --  there 's so many things  --  I don make  --  enough money ... " He backed a step away from her . " But we can live here . You jus said you wanted ? " " That was kind o crazy . I know it 's not enough to live on ? two of us . I 'm jus a common bootblack . I could n't take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  live on his money . I 'd feel like he was payin ... " When he broke off , she gave no response . In the silence that continued on and on , he gradually brought his eyes up to meet hers and recognized in them the same look of lonely betrayal that he had watched so long , so callously , in his mother 's when Henry went away . He could n't admit that he was playing unconsciously for time to think over his doubts about May 's white ancestry ; but he realized that a plea of needing more money had never been an argument against marriage . And most of all he was acutely aware of having shattered May 's trust in his devotion . Like a blind jackass , he had blundered ahead and said things as excuses that did n't need saying at all . He took her hand and cupped it in both of his and then drew her , listless , into his arms . " It 's all right , May , " he said . " I jus had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense like you . I ai n't even got bat brains . " For a few moments , he waited for some reply , but when none came , he whispered , " Do n't be mad at me , May . " Still no answer ; and soon he went on : " We 'll get married soon . Real soon . We can figure it out some way ... " And as he talked , her hands crept firmly up his back and clasped him to her . The following morning his disturbance  --  the fear of mixed blood and deference to the whites  --  seemed such a minor thing that he could hardly isolate it from his ephemeral concern with how to live his life . He wondered why , after all , he had suddenly become so upset ; but in spite of his accommodation to the idea , a dim ingrained anxiety trickled through his thoughts and he could n't resist going to ask Aunt Martha about it . Toward his mother there had always been a reticence , now even more powerful since Tobe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered into an aura of conspiracy , as if she , having always lived , by white standards , " in sin , " but with a competence that corn-  | manded respect , could never shame him for his actions or notions , could understand them thoroughly , tolerantly and humorously , and in the end could give the answer . Her answer , submerged in a great deal of talk about why did he worry about such things as not having pure blood ? " Tha 's jus white folks talk turnt around , " she commented  --  and why did n't he use his head about Mr. Theo , came down finally to her old advice : " Stop tormentin yo brains an enjoy life while you got it . " Though he welcomed the easy solution she had offered , one tiny objection lingered  --  he was just a shoeshine boy  --  and drove him to delay the thought of marriage until he could get a job that ould give him more respectable work , that could set him on a level with May 's ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . Bit by bit , he dropped hints of marriage around the supper table at home , but no one seemed to notice . Columbus was too dense , probably , to grasp them ; Annie and Tobe were no doubt too engrossed in each other to pay his words any mind . He fretted over the embarrassment of making a formal announcement , preferring for them to know his plans intuitively , until one night a natural opening was presented . Tobe remarked that several men had left the shops to look for work in the new oil fields in Louisiana . " If I had one o them jobs , " said George timorously , " I could get married . " " If a frog had wings , he would n't bump is rump when e jump , " chanted Columbus . " You mean if you had a gal you could get married , " said Tobe . " Ah , he got a gal already , " spoke up Annie . " Got a job too , far as that goes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . " Not fo two peoplc . " Annie put a fork full of greens back on her plate and gazed at him . " Has you done pop the question to May ? " she asked in astonishment . George nodded and grunted an affirmative sound . " When 's it goin to be ? " " Not till I get mo pay , " said George . " We 'll have to live at Miss Lucy 's , I reckon . Be too crowded here , kind o , " he added sheepishly , " an my money ai n't enough to take care of us all there . "  | " But we can make room here , " protested Annie . " You ai n't gon na go off an leave me , are you ? Columbus can move into ? " " I guess May would n't want a leave her ma all by erself right now . With ev'ybody gone , she 'd feel  --  real bad maybe . " " Yeah , tha 's true . Po Miss Lucy , " sighed Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense of the other side : " Well , what 's wrong with her house ? Why cai n't you live there on yo pay ? " " I 'd feel like I ' as livin off Mr. Theo . Cai n't neither one of em work . Leastaways , they don now . " " Mr. Theo ! " scoffed Annie . " He 'd a better left er some money . If e had n't , I 'd a skunt im alive . After all , he done suppo't Miss Lucy near'bout all cr born days . " " You talkin silly talk , George , " said Tobe gently . " Don look a gift horse in the mouth . We don get so many things give us that we can pick an choose what we take . " Since no one seemed to share his feelings about Mr. Theo 's farewell , George , submitting to their judgment as proper , did n't want to expose his worries any further . In the face of his silence , Tobe continued . " But if you jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diff'ent color . I been after you lots o times to come to the shops with me an see if you cai n't get on there . Yo friend Bucky Miller 's there now . But you always say you satisfied blackin boots an cai n't work aroun machinery . " " Well , I did n't know then  --  I did n't know how . . . " stammered George , trying to think which of several things would explain his change of attitude . But Tobe saved him from a final statement . " With all these boys gone from the shops , it ought a be easy fo you to get on . I 'll ask the foreman tomorrow an tell im about you . An if e sounds all right , then you can come up with me when e say , an fo you know it you 'll be in a good job . " There was a glitter of hopeful pleasure in George 's eyes , but he did n't reply at once . After some moments of consideration , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not sure just how dirty it was . " May might not take to me doin ? " " You know how to wash , do n't you ? " asked Tobe edgily . " Henry used to shovel coal , " Annie reminded him , " jus like Tobe. "  | " An shinin shoes ai n't ' xactly lily-white work , either , " put in Columbus . " Aw . . . " said George . " I mean , I jus thought maybe there was some cleaner jobs I could some day get . " " If you git yo own business , " said Tobe , " you can maybe have a clean job . Like Jim Lemon or Cato an his blind tiger . Knew a nigger once down in Vicksburg had his own barber shop an even had white customers . But when us folks hire out fo a job , we get the dirty work an nothin else an tha 's all there is to it . I know how to run a engine , but I cai n't be even engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all the signals and rules , but I cai n't be it . Some jobs  --  all the good ones  --  is so nice they 're only fo white folks . I 'm bout as high up as I can go right now . An if you goin to marry , an worry bout money , you better get goin as high as you can right soon . Havin enough money  --  even jus enough  --  will sho help keep you from doin things that get you in dutch . Long as you stay in yo place , but jus about to get in dutch , the white folks 'll be happy an you 'll get along . " On the following day Tobe reported that the foreman had said there were a couple of vacancies in the shops that George might be able to start in ; as he had no experience maybe the job of cleaning fireboxes would be the best one . " What 's that ? " asked George . The foreman , Tobe told him , would explain it ? it really was n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might go on to something better like boilermaker 's helper . After the interview with the foreman , George , in a delight of excitement , rushed across town to tell May he had a new job , beginning Monday . She and her mother were sipping mid-morning coffee , but he was too nervous to have any . While he chattered on about the shops , and the foreman and what the work involved and how Tobe had talked him up , Miss Lucy enveloped him in an admiring , unwavering look . And when he paused for breath , wondering what all he had said , she murmured , " I 'm mighty proud o you , George . " " Golly , tha 's real nice , " added May . " So  --  so  --  when you get ready to , we can  --  go ahead , " said George . " Next month ? " asked May shyly . " Sure . " He felt suddenly so drained by all he had poured out , that in spite of the profusion of other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no more than grin , with his lips twitching sometimes into a quick pout in the effort to control them . " Why not next week ? " asked Miss Lucy archly . " Sure . Yeah . " " Can we , George ? " cried May jumping up in exuberance . " Why not ? " " Yeah , why not ? " " I 'm awful glad you gon be my son , now , " said Miss Lucy . " I was so happy when May tole me , it cured me right off . " George kept on grinning , as he remembered that he had n't seen Miss Lucy in some days , all the time she hid the culmination of her sorrow , and with an abrupt movement , he got up . " I got a get down to the barber shop , " he blurted in dismay . " Got a tell em I 've got another job . They 'll bawl me out fo bein late . " " Oh , they 'll fire you ! " exclaimed May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and down the slope . He could n't recall , as he went toward town , whether he had really missed the silver-framed photo from the mantel or whether he merely created the impression for himself , because of the change in Miss Lucy . The two barbers glowered at his tardiness , and ordered him quick to shine the shoes of the drummer whose haircut was nearly done . When finally the shop reached a slack period , and George could reveal that he was leaving to work in the shops , they were laconic at first , as if to suggest that he had no importance in their lives or business ; and then they began to tease him about railroad work . " Coin to give Casey Jones a run for his money , huh ? " " You jumpin out o the fryin pan into the fire , boy . You gon be shinin whole engines ' stead of just two shoes . " " Maybe so , Mr. Jimmy , " countered George ; and was astonished at the boldness of his next speech : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth o money fo it . " But the barbers only laughed , and seemed to ignore any reflection on the salary they paid him . " You ai n't goin to like it  --  working yo ass to a frazzle , " said Mr. Jimmy . " You know you too lazy to do all that hard labor , " said Mr. Bostwick . " Now ai n't you , George ? Come on , ' fess up . "  | " Yessuh , " agreed George . " I 'm pretty lazy . But I 'm gon get married an I got a have mo money to live on . " With the subject of marriage to add to their kidding , the two men whooped . " Why , boy , " cried Mr. Bostwick , as he honed his razors , " time you sweat all day in them hot shops , you ai n't going to have strength enough to do yo wife no good . You 'll be all tuckered out and limp as a dishrag . " " I ai n't had no trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me them engines got some kind o metal in em , " said Mr. Jimmy in that tone of exaggeration George knew so well , " something like a loadstone , and if you work around em for long , it 'll draw all the bone out of your tallywhacker and then you 'll be just about as much good to a woman as a oyster is in a keyhole . " George snickered a high laugh and said , " Aw , you 're jus spoofin me , Mr. Jimmy , ai n't you ? " But when the barber denied it gleefully , George continued the game . " How long do it take  --  to sap your strength ? " " Depends on how much you 've used it . Now some grown men , what 's been busy with the ladies a whole lot , it takes em a year or more . But a young ' un like you  --  why , I would n't give you more'n three weeks . " This time George whooped . " I been a lot busier than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , George , " put in Mr. Bostwick , " you could n't a been doing it before you was nine , could you ? How early 'd you start ? in the cradle ? " A man came in for a shave , and they dropped their exchanges . At the end of the day , George asked if they would n't pay him off so he could quit then , but Mr. Jimmy said he 'd have to work through Saturday . " And , " he added ominously , " you better find me another shine-boy  --  a good one , too  --  by Saturday , or you wo n't get any pay at all . " " Aw , Mr. Jimmy , you would n't do that , would you ? Treat me that way ? " pleaded George in sudden alarm . " Treat you that way ! " cried the barber , and now an overtone of banter seeped into his voice . " Look how you treat me  --  walk  | out on me and leave me without any help . You hustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right . Ai n't you got a little brother ? " " Yessuh , but he wo n't work like this . He wo n't work at nothin hardly but outdoors ... " " He wo n't ! What you mean he wo n't ? " George was flustered at the tone . " He jus cai n't , I mean . He ai n't got good sense enough . I mean , he already got a job an them white folks wo n't turn him loose . He jus likes workin in gardens an that stuff . " " Well , " said Mr. Jimmy , with his touchiness appeased , " he wo n't get rich farming . " And , thought George as he went home , wo n't get rich shining shoes either . Supper that evening was lively with talk of his new job and his marriage , but mostly the latter , somewhat to Columbus ' chagrin . Whenever the job was mentioned , Columbus kept bidding for attention . " I got a new job too , " he would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job all day long , with Miz Abe Turner . " But Annie shushed him , and asked the date of the wedding . George replied vaguely , " Wednesday or Thu'sday , I reckon . " Tobe objected immediately ; next week would be George 's first at the shops , he argued , and that was n't any time to be getting married . George would have to be getting up earlier to be on time  --  a lot earlier , since he 'd be living all the way across town ? and Tobe was n't going to have him start out with a bad record . " I done talked you up a lot about what a good worker you was , " he said , " an I want you to live up to it . I think you better wait till Sat'day so you can sleep on Sunday . " At length they all agreed that this was the best plan . " You got any money to buy a license ? " asked Tobe . " A what ? " Tobe tried to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons for having one and for paying money for it . " Tha 's jus fo white folks , ai n't it ? " asked George . " But if May wants ? a license , we 'll get one . " " An a ring , " said Annie . " You ought a have a ring . " " Why ? " " Miss Lucy an May is such fine people an so stylish , they 'll  | sho think it 's funny if you many with a license an without a ring . " " But do n't they cost a lot ? " " Reckon they does . But it would be nice . You jus ask Martha . She sees lots o white folks ' weddins , when she caters fo the receptions . She tell you bout it  --  how she sit up in the gallery of the church an watch all the scrumptious goins-on . " " Well , Annie , " said Tobe , placatingly , " you know they cai n't have all that . They need money to eat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll jus marry peaceful like at Miss Lucy 's , " said George . " She got a nice house an tha 's where we 'll live anyhow . " " An we can have a party after ! " cried Annie . " Martha an me 'll figure it out . But could n't we get a ring  --  one at Killigrew 's , one better'n comes in them marshmallows ? " Before anyone could comment on her suggestion , a quick knock fell on the door , which opened immediately revealing Henry framed in the dark gap , poised between weariness and glad rest . He moved a couple of steps into the room before he realized who was there . As the expectant light in his face died out into hurt surprise , he halted and his hand swung the door shut behind him . The four at the table , frozen in their motions or wrenched about in their chairs , stared in a sudden hushed hiatus , until Annie breathed his name and Columbus called , " Pa ! " and went to him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus caught an unresponsive hand in his own . " I come back , Annie . " His head drooped , and now his free hand covered the boy 's two clinging ones and pressed them . " I been ashamed to , fo now . " When Annie rose , slowly from shock and noisily with the bumping of the chair , to go to him , with George following her , Tobe twisted back to the table and , leaning his forearms on the edge , gazed into his plate of half-eaten food . " I done married again , Henry . I got another husban . " " But you was my wife . " " I bought a paper , Henry . I did n't think you was ever comin back . Did n't nobody . " " I did n't know how to . I wanted to . I did n't even want a go . I been all over . "  | For a long time no one could speak except Columbus , who asked where Henry had been and what did he do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeming to reply to a question , Annie said , " Tobe 's been good to me . Like you was , Henry . " Henry looked at the back of the man bent over the table  --  the man , he suddenly remembered , who had tried to make him go home to Annie the night he had fought Jim Lemon and run away  --  and then looked at his two sons . A wry smile crept over his neatly defined lips . " You boys done growed up , " he said . " Make me feel like a olc broken-down man . " Though he laughed softly , as if he had made a joke , they could not join him in more than his pained smile , and the room smothered again in a bewildered hush . At last Henry spoke . " Anybody at Martha 's now ? " When Annie shook her head , he turned away toward the door . " Guess I can stay with her a while then . Got a stay somewhere till I get work . " Disconsolately Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go with you , Pa , " cried Columbus . " Yeah , you go long with yo pa , C'umbus , " said Annie . She stood immobile while Henry disappeared through the door and Columbus ran after him , dragging a jacket on as he went . After the door was shut , she returned to the table and sank sadly into her chair . " Oh , Tobe ! He look so bad , eyes all squunched in , like a devil 's eatin im up . Ai n't shave fo days either , I bet . I bet e was hungry too . " Tobe put his arms comfortingly about her . " He 'll be all right now , Annie , " he said . " You know where e is . You know e come back to you . You don have to worry no mo . " Unable to leave the house or join them at the table where no one would finish supper , George watched numbly . He had n't been able to tell his father about the wedding . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , but he could n't bring out the words . It seemed now a secret of his own , to which Henry had no right . But he knew Columbus would tell him as they went along to Aunt Martha 's . " Yeah , I ' as in Memphis a long time , " Henry replied to his son 's flood of questions . He was walking unusually fast , Columbus thought , but speaking in fatigue and distaste , as if just to be  | kind to the curious boy pacing at his side . As if to make amends for his absence and silence and cruelty in the past months , as if to punish himself for his behavior . " Yeah , it 's a big town . Worked in a cotton warehouse till she left me . Then I was tryin to come home , but she stole all the money I 'd saved an what I had on me I got drunk on . " " Why , Pa ? " asked Columbus . " Cause I ' as mad . Mad about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home an bein left by er . An when I got sober , I 'd done lost my job . " " Naw , I mean why 'd she leave you ? " Henry looked sideways at his son , trying to size him up . " You tall as I am , Columbus , " he mused , avoiding a more specific comment on his conclusions . The boy balked at a rejoinder , and in a moment Henry reverted to the question . " Lef cause she wanted mo money , wanted to go to dancin joints an hear the music an drink an flirt with the fellows there . I did n't make enough an we got to fightin a lot . Then she lit out with some stud an last I heard she was worlcin in a cat house . " " Aw , Pa ! Why 'd she want a do that when you ' as tryin to take care of er ? " Columbus was hurt that anyone should mistreat his father . " Oh , she ai n't a whore he'self . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that cat house . She 's a kind o towel girl , you know , jus cleans up an all . I did n't never try to find her . " Columbus sank into a meditation , and truthfully hardly knew what more to say about it to his father . They continued for a while in silence , for Henry had become thoughtful too . Moreover , they were crossing the business section now and it was probably best not to talk of such subjects when white people , meeting , passing or following them , were in hearing range . But when they turned off and left the street lights and scattered lighted store windows for the dimness of a residential street , Henry spoke again . " What about Cora , son ? " " Nothin , " said Columbus resignedly . " She jus gone North and disappeared . " He told the little he knew , after which Henry sighed , " Po little Cora ! Maybe if I had . . . " But he did n't finish , and another silence settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do after that , Pa  --  after she went away ?  | " I lef town an after a long time got down to the Delta . Worked on a plantation there . " " Did you like that ? I 'm workin sort o like that now . Gardening , I mean . You did n't know I been workin ever since you lef ? " " You workin , Columbus ! " exclaimed Henry . " What at ? " " Well , first it ' as George 's job with the cows , an lots of other little jobs I 'd get . An now I 'm gon be yard boy fo Miz Turner ? Miz Abe Turner . Old man Turner 's makin a lot of money an they want to put on some dog . He 's goin in partners with McLain 's drygoods nex do ' , they say . " He went on to describe how Mrs. Turner , to outshine all the ladies in town , already had a decorative iron fence surrounding the front lawn , and wanted two lines of maples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red salvia against the house . In the center of the two plots of lawn , split by the walk , big round beds of flowers would taper like a cone from a peak of tall cannas down in lowering circles of daisies , petunias and so forth to the outer band of verbena . When he was n't mowing the lawns and digging around the flowers and watering in the heat of summer , he would work inside the house . Henry listened without much interest , all the time wondering about work for himself ; but at last he remarked that the job sounded fine for Columbus . Then he added reflectively , " I got to find me somethin to do . The school wo n't take me back , I know . An I ca n't ask Doctor Tom either . He wo n't help me none now . " " You 'll find somethin , Pa . We 'll all keep a lookout . What was it like , farming in the Delta ? Did you have to buy a farm ? " Henry laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relieving amusement . " You ai n't growed up all the way if you think I can buy a farm . Specially in the Delta . That land 's pure gold . What you so concerned fo ? " " I kind o thought I 'd like to farm . " " Well , I bet you would n't like this kind . They got plantations tha 's miles across an flat as a pancake an not hardly a tree in sight ' less you can see all the way to the edge o creation . Little low line o trees there , usually . An in summer when you workin out there , the heat jus squiggles all aroun you like little hot whips . " " Do they pay you by the week ? "  | " Not ' xactly . They give you a place to live , with cotton growin right up to the walls . One stalk come up in the middle o our little ole po'ch an we was scared to cut it down , cause the overseer might a charged it out o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tha 's your pay  --  what you live off of . The boss owns a store too , an you buy all your grub an stuff there , an e charges it to you an you pay when the crop 's made , cause one share o the crop is yours . Trouble is you don hardly ever get enough to pay off what you owe im , much less make anything fo yo'self . " " Even if you make a good crop ? " " Oh , if cotton prices was high , maybe you could . But when prices are high , the crops are bad , an it just comes back down to the same thing  --  you always workin to pay fo what you done already et . " " If you wanted to farm some mo , Pa , I bet you could get work with Mr. Jebb brings in Mr. Abe 's veg'tables . He 's got a goodsize farm jus south o town an he may need help . Want me to ask ? " " How come you know all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all these things ? " Henry laughed faintly . " I finds out . Learned that when I first started  --  you got a know what 's goin on about jobs if you gon a get one . " " Sure , find out fo me . I do n't much care what kind o work . I 'd a stayed in the Delta ' cept fo you boys an Annie . I wanted to be back with you . " " Maybe when George leaves , you can come live there , " Columbus suggested . He was greatly pleased at the impression he had made on his father , the wonder of Henry at his industry , and hoped they could be together again . But Henry , with sad scorn , only grunted . " Naw , I could n't do that  --  not with Tobe in the house , " he said ; then with a sudden change of tone : " George leavin ? Where 's he  --  goin ? " " Ah , you know . Did n't we tell you ? He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Henry paused for reflection , in the shock that time passes , ageing men , much faster than they would admit . " Who to ? " " To May , Miss Lucy 's girl . " " Well , I 'll be switched ! That really do make me an ole man .  | Anyhow , she 's a good girl . And George is a good boy , too . Ai n't he ? Or is he gettin rambunctious ? " " He 's a good boy , " answered Columbus apathetically , and said no more . By now they were walking down Rosson Row , toward Aunt Martha 's shack . Henry glanced up the bank at the house where he and Annie had lived together for so long , raising their children , worrying , struggling , aching and then forgetting it in spasms of happiness . And there , next door , where he saw the lighted windows , Miss Lucy 's house where May must be sitting  --  planning her life with George ? he wondered ; or reading a book ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " I 'll be a grandpa fo you know it , " he mumbled . And to himself he went on thinking , " And I never done anything  --  hardly anything  --  for a one of em . But even now I do n't know anything I could have done . It do n't seem right somehow that a roof and some clothes and pots of vittles is all a man can give in all those years , and then one sundown he 's old and soon going to die and still nothing done  --  nothing good , nothing to satisfy , like a drink of spring water after a hot day 's plowing. " 19 Always more work to do , it seemed , the more the weather turned to spring , just when you wanted to enjoy the odorous air and the cantaloupe-colored sunshine and daydreaming in the shade of new-leafed trees . But maybe , thought Henry as he loaded baskets of fresh vegetables onto the wagon bed to drive into town , it was only the things you wanted to do that made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were growing longer and , now that he was working on Mr. Wallace Jebb 's truck farm , he missed living in town where he could always run over to see Annie while Tobe was at work , even if she did protest and say the neighbors would gossip . But unless he walked in  --  three miles was n't too far for a young squirt of a man , which Henry kept feeling he was n't  --  he had no  | chance to see her except those days when he hauled the vegetables to Mr. Abe Turner 's store . Mr. Abe , as Columbus said , had consolidated with McLain 's drygoods and at the back where he figured his accounts at a high desk amid fringes of harness , reins , singletrees , plows and shovels that hung from rafters and joists , a door had been cut through the common wall . Though he kept primarily a farmer 's supply and grocery store , Mr. Abe also stocked calico , dimity and such notions as farm wives might prefer to buy where their husbands traded . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he refused Henry would peddle first to other stores , then through the residential streets , riding up one , down another , crying , " Nice ripe toMA-A-tas ! Po-o-ole beans ! E-english peas ! Squash ! " When he had sold them all , he could drive over to Possum Hollow and maybe find Annie at home before he returned to the country . The farm was just beyond the small river south of town , partly on flat land , rich from overflows , and partly on a hillside where the Jebbs had a cottage . Behind the barns there was a three-room cabin for the help  --  Tim , an ageing Negro , and his wife  --  and Henry crowded in with them . The woman , Phronie , when not working the gardens , would cook their meals . It was n't tenant farming  --  Mr. Jebb said he was a strict , honest man and never made any debts or loans ; each man was paid a dollar a week and subsistence , and he gave them , as lagniappe , the left-over seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry walked in to tell Martha about the new job and to visit George and May . When they married , he had refused to go to the wedding , and sat alone in Martha 's house all evening , except for a short walk , avoiding the road where he might meet an acquaintance , up the barren field opposite the row of shacks . He could hear the noise of the party , the soaring laughter and the wheezy music from Miss Lucy 's gramophone ; and all the despondency that had gathered inside during the past years burst over him and surprised him with moist eyes and a throttling sigh . For the first time since his youth , he sensed the pride of fatherhood and for the first time ever , the sadness of his inadequate response and of how all his chances were gone irrevocably . And then , picturing his son and the bride , he thought of himself and Annie  --  Annie wanting some Scriptures read over them so she 'd feel more married , and he laughing  | at her for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home life , and the first child and the second , and the deaths , and the other children coming on . And gradually he began to think that in those days he had n't been altogether inadequate ; he had simply lost something along the way , or not gained something he should have ; he had done as well as he knew how . Maybe it was n't so bad : his boy George was married to a good girl , even if she did have white blood . When he went to Miss Lucy 's to see them , George asked why he had n't come to the wedding . Henry was embarrassed , but finally said , " I did n't want a be here with Tobe . I thought it 'd make things uneasy . " " But Tobe was n't here , Pa , " said George . And when Henry 's mouth gaped , he explained . " Tobe said the same as you  --  said you ' as the one really should be here , you an Ma . " " Tha 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An I been meanin to ' pologize to you . I promised I 'd run down an fetch you when Annie showed up without Tobe , an en I clean forgot it . You been out o my mind so much , I ai n't quite got you back in it . " But Henry was laughing boisterously long before she had finished , thinking how funny it was that both Annie 's men had stayed away from her son 's wedding . After that , everyone got into a good humor and laughed , and Henry and George told each other about their work and Miss Lucy brought in some coffee and May passed cookies and Aunt Martha ate hungrily . Henry climbed up to the spring seat of the loaded wagon and with a " Yessuh " to Mr. Jebb 's final shouted instructions , headed the mare into the familiar road . He set the crown of his coarse straw hat against the sun , slumped on the seat and , resting an elbow on the leg propped on the headboard , let the reins dribble from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely woven straw , threw a pattern of tiny bright spots over his arms , where the shadow of the brim fell , and already each spot burned like a pin prick . It was going to be a scorcher today ; the sky was colorless as the inside of a white-hot oven . The heat sank down relentlessly from it , day and night , in a slow blast . Mr. Abe , reacting to it , flew off the handle about nothing  --  a few corn borers in the roas'n'ears . The housewives barked at him from their porches , rocking distractedly and fanning with silk-bound palm leaves , when he told them the prices of butter beans and okra . And Mr.  | Jebb , fairly even-tempered in spite of his red hair , was getting cranky , accusing Henry of wasting time on deliveries and not working hard enough on the farm . " And bring them baskets back ! " he had yelled as Henry drove away . " Every clang one of em sittin there an we got nothin to put eggplants in ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he grunted a short laugh . Those baskets were useful to him too , he had discovered . It was customary to leave the vegetables in the baskets at the store rather than remove them to others ; and on each trip a few empties would be stacked , one fitting inside the other , at the back of the store . One day when Henry leaned over to pick them up , he smelled a sweet odor . There , right at his nose , on the counter where the farmer women bought their notions , was a pile of soap  --  perfumed with violets , he guessed , for those were violets painted on the wrappers . He sometimes wondered afterward why he did it , and always shrugged and thought , Why the hell not ? for who would ever miss it or ever care ? Mr. Abe was sitting in a cane-bottom chair on the sidewalk at the door . With hardly a pause in his bending down for the baskets and rising with them , Henry yanked three of the baskets out of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top baskets back tight , and was walking away , saying an ordinary good-bye to Mr. Abe almost before he realized what he had done . He had tossed the interlocked baskets into the wagon , unhitched the mare , and driven straight to Annie . When he turned into the alley , he could see her rocking and fanning , just like the white ladies , on the little porch behind the row of plants , and then as she spied him , bustling into the house . " What make you do this way , Henry ? " she burst out , once he had entered the room . She lumbered about the cramped space , with her dress hanging in uneven soiled folds , the hem torn and dragging and her middle damp from the heat , and smacked the cardboard fan exasperatedly against her skirt . " You know ev'ybody settin on the ' po'ches to cool off an they can see you comin here . You know Tobe gon find out . " " I brung you somethin , " said Henry meekly . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Tobe 's gone . I don want no bad talk about me . " " Here , " whispered Henry , extending a cake of soap on the palm of each hand . " Look . "  | " Oh , ai n't they pretty ! " She inclined her face over them ? " Do n't they smell sweet ! " ? and flinging the fan aside took the two bars and held them to her nose . Then suddenly she thrust them back . " Oh , Henry honey , I cai n't take em . I jus cai n't . What 'll I tell Tobe ? " " Please keep em , Annie . " He put his hand on her arm , but she dropped the soap on the table and moved away . " I get lonesome fo you , Annie . It 's real lonesome , jus workin , an night comes and nobody cares an you jus sit out in the nighttime fo a while an then lay there in the dark  --  by yo'self . " Annie would n't face him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she said softly . " You know I ai n't the kind to mess up my ways with two men . " " It ai n't jus gals , Annie . It 's somethin else . It 's what our house used to be like  --  with the kids around , an you . It 's jus the way it felt , kind o . " She made no response and his tone was touched with stubbornness . " Sure , I can get gals , I reckon . But they wo n't stop me from hero lonesome . " Annie turned to him . " We done lost that , " she said , " an the chil'ren done growed up  --  gone  --  married  --  all but one . An now I ai n't gon do nothin to hurt Tobe . " Disappointed , he shifted his eyes from her and a moment later reached for the cakes of soap . But she was already crossing the floor , and halted his reach with her hand . " Nothin to hurt immuch as I loves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . " Don bring nothin else , Henry . I 'll jus have to hide it . " The wagon jounced as the wheels hit the worn-down juncture of the dirt road and the river bridge , and rumbled over the timbers . For a minute it seemed cool , and the air struck pleasantly on the wet streaks that had begun to creep down Henry 's temples and chest and back . He might have known : Annie always had that upright nature . He could guess what she must have felt when he was spending all that time with Luella ; he could n't blame her for taking up with Tobe . He merely felt sorry for himself , now that , as she reminded him , it was all lost ; and all worse too , because he had such an isolated life on the farm : Tim and Phronie falling on the bed right after supper , though they could n't sleep for the stifling heat in the cabin ; and he sitting on the back step at the porch , just looking at the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and listening  | to katydids and whippoorwills and sometimes the wind which , blowing so seldom these days that he paid attention , sieved through the far-off pine woods but never reached as far as his cabin . On those nights he thought about his life with Annie ; and sometimes of the children who died so young ; and many times of Cora who now seemed to him to have died young too ; and over and over of George and Columbus , who , like all of them , seemed to refuse him knowledge . But always , with every thought , of Annie : Annie , who had put up with all his devilment and pranks when they were young , and had liked him in spite of it all : she had acted almost the same when he was running around with Luella as when , before their marriage , he flirted with two of the girls on the Murchison place . IIe could see a difference , of course ; how in their youth she pretended not to care what he did , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road with him in the dusk after supper , almost ignoring Henry if they happened to meet , so that he would snicker and say to himself , " She 's tryin to make me jealous  --  thinks she 'll rile me up , like them white gals at the co-tillions " ; and how , after the wedding , she pretended not to know that he was seeing other girls ( although there were n't any for a long time and then the first one  --  that what 's her name ? ? chased him down , right into the furnace room at the school , and it was n't his fault ) and even pretended that there were n't any at all until Luella , when anybody could guess and everybody knew , and he was crazy and made a mess of everything ( damn , damn it all ) ; and that was because Luella made him imagine he was eighteen instead of forty-something or whatever he was ; and even then Annie kept on pretending in one way , but in another letting him know she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe and could n't pretend any more ; and then the silence and the hurt he could sense in her but feel no compassion for ( damn , damn , why did n't , could n't , he ? ) and her concern with the family after that  --  why could n't he have thought of that , too , before running off with a woman like Luella , before finding out too late that that was what he would want for his comfort and peace in a few years ? Annie , who could forgive all those weaknesses and errors and cruelties , and could still , he felt , love him but refuse to entangle her life with two men ; who fussed about little things over which  | they could make up easily ( but not about Luella ) ; who managed the best she could on what he made and washed clothes to help out with a little extra money ; who had given him the only happiness he could remember , had been his wife and borne his children . Annie , for whom he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his occasional presents to win her away from Tobe . For he had ignored her stricture against the presents and shortly afterward had brought her three bandanna handkerchiefs , once more secreted between the empty baskets . Though she railed forlornly and tormented her brain about the neighbors and Tobe , he could see that she still held a wealth of affection for him , a wealth which she denied him always now , but which might be grasped in time . When he brought her the length of gingham  --  it had been so easy : Mr. Abe had just sold some to a farmer 's wife and gone with her to ask her husband about the cotton crop , leaving the bolt on the counter ; Henry flipped it nimbly and softly over and over , snipped the selvedge with the scissors and ripped the width the way he had seen it done ; and crammed it between the baskets  --  Annie had shaken it out and cried , " You ai n't got money to pay fo all this  --  it must be ten or fifteen yards ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her obvious pleasure ; but she pled with him not to continue his gifts . Still he could not resist his hope at the sight of the joy that crept from hiding in her eyes whenever he gave her something . One day , after the door through the party-wall into the McLain store was finished , Mr. Abe sent him to the other side to clear out the cartons behind a counter where a new stock of silk ribbons had been unpacked . When he came down the aisle , the two clerks crossed to the other side to chat with a friend , and as he stooped below the counter and piled the boxes , he could see through the glass case their backs , above the discs wound with colored ribbons . The doors of the case were open , the new spools lying loose ; a quick movement brought one of them down among the waste cartons . Annie was suspicious , nervous and embarrassed . " Ribbon costs money , " she said fearfully . " You been stealin ? " And when he only smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that she convinced herself , " You ai n't been stealin , Henry ? Oh , Henry , what we gon na do ? " " I did n't steal  | it , " he replied , touched but pleased that tears had come into her eyes . " It jus fell in some trash I was carryin out . " " Don bring me anything else , " she said , her voice quivering with emotion . " If you love me , an jus wo n't bring me no mo presents , I 'll talk to Tobe about us . I 'll tell im soon as I can , you want me back . Please , Henry , please . We done had enough trouble . We both almos alone . Will you promise on the Bible ? " Henry promised , happy that his plan had worked out so well ; but when he tried to hug her , she pushed him away , saying she was still married to Tobe . More than a week had passed , and he had heard nothing from her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tobe . As the wagon approached the edge of town , Henry caught the reins tightly . An automobile was bouncing toward him , with a cloud of choking dust boiling behind it , and the horse began to act skittish . When the car had passed and the mare was calmed down again , Henry fanned the dusty air away with his hat . Passing the waterworks and the red brick stack above the electric plant , the wagon moved across the creek bridge into the main street , thick with dust between the ragged weedy borders . Ahead , he could see , a few houses apart , two ladies at the side , each directing a spray from a garden hose at the street , and he laughed , seeing the blobs where the water fell dark on the thirsty earth only to fade as the futile stream moved away . " You can do that all day , " he thought , " but it ai n't gon keep the dust down an out o yo lace curtains . " He hitched to the post outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As usual , Mr. Abe was seated at the door in a chair tilting against sacks of potatoes . Beside him squatted a farmer , raw-boned , almost Indian-faced , with leaden black hair matting on his damp forehead . They were talking about a bug called the boll weevil , which had ruined the cotton over in Texas and Louisiana , and had now invaded Mississippi . Henry halted a few steps away , waiting to be noticed by Mr. Abe . " My brother seen em in Glendora , seen what they done , that is , " the farmer was saying between chews of tobacco . " Don know how they got there , but they 's there all right . They jus eat up the insides of the boll an do n't no cotton to speak of ever come out . "  | " Is it all over the Delta ? " asked Mr. Abe . " It 's what I hear . But I ai n't seen no signs of em around here . " " Be a bad year for cotton planters , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 'll get a good price . " " Oh , it wo n't be that scarce , " said Mr. Abe cheerfully . " Few bo ' weevil wo n't affect the market . I 'm going to be buying cotton myself this year , you know . With Theo Burton gone , there 's not hardly another man in the game around here . So keep me in mind if you see a fellow with a nice stand of it . " When Henry at last inched forward , thinking Mr. Abe would never invite him to speak , he encountered a heat-clouded gaze that suddenly replaced the previous look of happy interest . " Yeah , Henry ? " asked Mr. Abe , and Henry vaguely indicated the wagon . " Bring the damn stuff over here , " exploded Mr. Abe . " I ai n't goin out in that hot sun . " Yeah , too hot for you and not for me , thought Henry ; I tote in ten baskets and you send four-five of em back . But Mr. Abe bought all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empties at the rear . Not a word from Annie , he kept thinking , she ai n't spoke to Tobe , so I better take her another little present . What can I get , you reckon ? He stooped toward the baskets and with a twist of his head saw that Mr. Abe was still sitting at the sidewalk . An arm clasped the baskets against his hip as he rose and after a moment 's cautious hesitation , he stepped to the door connecting with the McLain part of the store . There were no customers and the clerks were lingering toward the airy , more cheery , front section . Only the bookkeeper in the tiny balcony across the rear could see him , and she was busy with a thick ledger . On the counter two steps inside were several open boxes , some with black , some with white goods  --  what was it ? Before he could distinguish the type , the bookkeeper whirled in her swivel chair , and he shrank away and took the baskets to the wagon . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked , returning to Mr. Abe . " Watering trough in the next block , " replied Mr. Abe , with a pause in mopping his face to hold the handkerchief at his cheek . " I ' as goin the other way . " " All right . There 's a wash pail behind the office desk . Do n't you take a new one , though , " he called to Henry 's retreating form .  | Almost too hurriedly , Henry reached the connecting door and scanned the interior of the drygoods department . He would get the bucket on the way out . He darted , tipping , to the counter where the tall case of thread would shield him , and peered into the boxes . Gloves  --  of silk mesh and of lace ! White lace gloves ? what would n't Annie say to that ? ? they 'd look like spider webs spun all around the deep walnut brown of her hands . Tingling with elation at the prospect of Annie 's reaction , he grabbed a pair and , slightly ducking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Abe . The farmer was standing beside him and , cocking his head , said , " Well , I 'll be dad-gum ! " Henry tried to drop the gloves and to stuff them into his pockets , but he could n't . He could only lift them hopelessly between himself and Mr. Abe , and say with desperate conviction , " I ' as goin to ask you , Mr. Abe . I ' as goin to buy em . " " You been gettin away with this a long time , Henry . Now you done got caught . " " That 's what comes of trustin em , " said the farmer . " Honest , Mr. Abe , " pleaded Henry , " I was n't stealin it . I was n't meanin to steal it . I would a paid fo it . " " You ai n't paid for none o the rest . The law 'll fix up your bill now . " The farmer laughed . " Pretty big bill , too , I bet . How long you been carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Abe , don get me into no trouble . I mean , please don call the law . Say what I owe , an I 'll pay some of it ever ' week . " " Take a long time to work all that out , " said the farmer . Mr. Abe glared at Ilenry and did n't answer . His eyes were disdainful , as if he gazed from a bridge at an eel floundering in a drying mud flat . Gasping , Henry plunged on , hoping to escape . " I jus wanted a little ole present fo my wife . I would a paid . Honest to God , Mr. Abe , I would . Please don get the law on me . I been a good nigger . " " No such thing as a good nigger , " said the farmer . " I try . Yo wife can tell you , Mr. Abe . Ask Miss Eva . She know us all , an her mama know us from way back . We try to be good . Most o the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . "  | " Your whole family 's a bad lot , " said Mr. Abe . " Bunch o worthless no-count niggers . " Henry gestured to refute him , for words seemed suddenly impossible and , though his mouth worked , nothing came out , not even the thoughts pounding in his brain  --  No , no , they 're not ? please , please  --  and his hands moved from side to side in front of him , but could not wipe out the white man or his judgment , and the white lace glove , still held gingerly in his fingers , swung gaily between them to show his guilt . " Go on , " said Mr. Abe with a wave of his hand . " We 're taking you over to the sheriff . " When the door was locked and the footsteps and chortles had died away down the corridor , Henry stood in the center of the cell still trying to form into words the turbulent but shapeless thoughts that crashed inside him . From that instant , during his pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mysteriously deserted him , he had accepted his punishment as proper and not to be questioned . He had preceded the two men across the town , dumbly and bewilderedly , through the shimmering streets toward the jail which now loomed in his mind as merely inevitable , useless to object to , to resist , to evade . Once on the way he had turned to Mr. Abe and held out the lace gloves penitentially . But Mr. Abe waved them away . " You hold it . They 're the evidence . " And a few steps further : " Could n't sell em nohow after you done handled em . " Remembering it now , Henry 's mind leaped from its chaos and yelled soundless to the jail walls : " That 's not true  --  not true ! You eat the biscuits our women knead ! You wet-nurse our women ! You sleep with them ! It 's not true ! You 're not afraid of our touch . " He quivered , swaying forward a bit , while in horror everything seemed to become clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word Except ringing sharp and hollow in his ears . " Except  --  what ? " His breathing sank fainter until he hardly drew in any of the room 's hot dank air , forever stained with odors of fungoid brick and plaster , urine and feces , and sweat-soaked wood , and he dragged his feet toward the long bench which , save for a slop pail , was the sole piece of furniture . " Why are you scared of us men ? " his thoughts sighed , and he sank down on the board , hunched over and beat his fists on his knees . The white  | lace gloves , spangling from his clenched fingers like an unreal flower , flopped up and down . And why was he scared , too scared  --  or too stupid , too submissive  --  to say what he thought to the sheriff ? He had been able to do no more than mumble and hold out that hypnotic pair of gloves , which , though condemning him , seemed the only excuse he could offer . In a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise of atonement for guilt , not the guilt of taking them but of something unknown , embedded beyond his past , which responded deep within him by bowing to the will of these white men . They had taken his name and put it in their book of crimes , while Mr. Abe stood by , stern , prompting or giving information , and the farmer slouched nearby making jokes . The sheriff had consoled Mr. Abe with deep-toned promises of cooling off the nigger , and a young deputy leaning on the high desk had asked , " You gon na press charges , Mr. Turner ? " " No need for a trial in a thing like this . " " Course not , " agreed the sheriff . " We can handle it best this way without no fuss . " " Well , there might be circumstances . . . " the deputy pursued . " Now Dune , " the sheriff interposed laughing , " do n't fret your head about these petty matters . This nigger ca n't afford a lawyer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood erect and shoved his hands in his pockets . " For a case like this ? Never 'd get to a court , ' cept like right here . ' Sides , this nigger could n't testify  --  he ca n't even talk to us . " The sheriff popped his hand jovially on his deputy 's shoulder . " We 're the police court for such as these . And we sentence him to  --  how many months would you say 'd be enough , Mr. Turner ? " " Oh . . . two , three . . . We 'll see later . Depends on how he behaves . " Henry 's fists kept thumping on his knees . The rhythm and the jolting helped to waken his senses . But when he was once more fully awake , and the arms subsided and the hours passed , he was overwhelmed with shame . Two nights he slept , an hour or so at a time , on the planks of the bench , only to wake wondering why his life had brought him  | to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious and quiet , when he had always felt with pride that the white folks said of him , " That 's a good nigger " ; wondering why his attempts to win Annie 's loyalty , after he had scorned it , should have led him to thieving ; wondering what Annie would think ( for she would never come back to him now ) , what George would think , and May and Miss Lucy and Columbus . And Mr. Wallace Jebb ? did he know ? What happened to the horse and wagon ? Then at last he would doze again and , in the stifling heat , his sweat would seep through his clothes and into the bench to mingle with that of the hundreds who before him had wakened to puzzle at similar questions . The young deputy came to his cell one morning and spraddled his legs before the door . " How long you been stealin , Henry ? " he asked . Henry answered that he had never stolen before that summer . " Kind o different from what you used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , bossman ? " " I used to see you , few years back , up at school playin with the kids . " As Henry moved suddenly to the bars , the young man smiled . " I do n't ' member you , " said Henry . " No , guess not , " the deputy said . " I came in at the tenth grade and I was too old for you to know . Came from out in Calhoun County . Papa was a farmer but decided he wanted to work on the railroads and live in town . " Henry pivoted with one hand clinging to a bar and lowered his head so as not to face the man . " I got off the track , I reckon . " " You got any white folks can help you ? " " Nawsuh . " " You must have some . . . somebody you can turn to . " " Nawsuh , ai n't nobody . Used to be , but not now . " The deputy hesitated , sensing the finality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Henry did not turn toward him , and his hand dropped from the iron bar . " You gettin enough to eat ? " " Yessuh , I gets plenty . " " If you want something , ask for Mr. Rogers . " Henry simply stared at him , and , after a long pause , the deputy mumbled ,  | " Well  --  take it easy , " and departed . Henry leaned into the corner , feeling more ashamed than ever of being confronted in jail by even a stranger , even a white man , who knew what he had been before . When his family came , for the news at last reached them , roundabout and slow until it touched to home and they appeared one by one , uneasy and shy in the jail corridor to say a few embarrassed words , he suffered an actual ache of remorse . Annie was the first , and he would have wished to prevent her coming , but knew that , powerless , he would have to endure her reproaches , whether she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he faced her , trembling at the recognition of her voice flowing down the passage as she thanked someone , and wishing there were some place to hide , he found only worry and sympathy in her . " Look at me , Henry , " she said . " You ai n't a baby . " Henry drew back from the gritty wall against which he had pressed himself and looked at her . " Honey ! " she said , lulling as if he were the baby she said he was n't . She poked a paper bag through the bars . " It 's jus some cupcakes . That young sheriff man said I could . " She stroked his hand and patted him as he took the bag , and he thought it was funny he had to get into jail to make her show her love . Crazy , stubborn women ! ? and he smiled then , and they could talk a little . Then Annie was sniffling and saying , " It 's on account o me , I know . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin , honey ? " He drew the crumpled lace gloves from his pocket and held them through the bars . " They never took it back , " he said . " Here ... " But she shrank away , shaking her head , and refused to touch them . " Jus put em on , " he begged . " Le ' me see em on yo hands . " " I cai n't , Henry , I jus cai n't . Throw em away . They 's bad luck . " Though her eyes were fixed on the gloves , admiring , yet fearful , she remained safely distant , in the middle of the corridor . " I got a go , Henry . I 'm scared o this place . " They were all scared , but Martha and Columbus came at once and George on Sunday , since the jailer would n't let him in after dark . As a result , Henry began at times to look on his predica-  | ment humorously as something like an illness  --  the " usual childhood diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  during which friends visited the sick . Would he get well or die ? ? or in Columbus ' words , " Will they ever let you out ? " " I reckon , " was all Henry could answer . " I wanted to come sooner , " said Columbus . " I ran all the way when I got off work . " He told how Miss Eva had kept the secret for two days , and even when she told him , backhandedly , pretended that he must already know . Then he begged Henry to let him ask Dr. Murchison for help , but Henry refused . " Doctor Tom done help me fo the las time , I spec , " he said . At the sound of an iron clang , Columbus stiffened . " They wo n't lock me in , will they ? " " You better run along , son . It 's gettin late . I 'll be all right . " When George came and also wanted to beg the doctor to do something , Henry answered wearily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , e can . We ai n't got no cause to bother im . " " But you got a have a white man help . That depity man tole me so jus now . He stop me comin in , an say fo me to find somebody to get you out . " Henry studied his son 's disturbed features a long time before he spoke . " Don do it . It ai n't help if we got a ask it from white folks . They 'll grudge it all yo life , say you ai n't grateful  --  say you want ev'ything give you . " " But they 've taken ev'ything away ! " cried George . " Sh ! Somebody 'll hear you . " " Goddam bastards ! Why don they make it so we would n't have to ? ? " " George ! " Henry broke in sternly . " Shut yo mouth . " Again he stared into his son 's face and when the mouth closed on a helpless sigh and the upraised hands dropped , Henry said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bound by their eyes and drawn into some unsayable understanding , George moved to the grille and closed his hands around the bars just above his father 's ; and a familiar pulse beat around them , beating up from a distant night of recollection , and fused their gaze , tautened their brows and held them motionless and silent . A smile glimmered at last and reflected from one to the other . " I hope May ai n't too upset , " said Henry .  | In the second week , the sheriff brought Mr. Abe to the cell and , standing on each side of the frame of bars , they explained his situation . " Mr. Turner , " said the sheriff , " is willin to help you , Henry . He thinks there 's no use you to be settin here if you can work out your debt some other way . " Henry flicked his eyes apprehensively but hopefully to Mr. Abe and asked what they meant . " Well , it 's like this , " Mr. Abe said ponderously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sentence by workin for me in the store instead of sittin in jail . " " But I work fo Mr. Wallace Jebb , " said Henry . " Mr. Jebb got another farm hand now . " " I can get a job when I get out . I can pay you out o my wages a little at a time . " The two men laughed deprecatingly . " That would n't be legal , " said the sheriff . " Take you forever an a day , anyhow . " " How much does it amount to ? " " That ai n't the point . You niggers do n't know nothin about the law  --  that 's the trouble . The point is , it ai n't the amount of money but the amount of crime . You committed a crime an so you owe a debt to society along with the cash to Mr. Turner . Take a long time in jail to make up for all that . You could set here for months , maybe  --  all depends . But since Mr. Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an you can work out your time there . " After a moment 's thought , Henry murmured , " You mean , I work fo nothing ? " " Well , not exactly that . You do n't get any pay in your own hands , but what you would get goes to make up for what you stole . " " But I cai n't live that way . I cai n't pay for anything to eat . I get fed in jail anyhow . " " You can figure that out , " the sheriff said offhandedly . " You got family to help you . Feedin you in jail costs money too . That just makes your time longer . " " How long will it be if I stay in jail ? " " How long ? " burst out the sheriff in annoyance . " I could bury you under this jail an pull it down on top o you for what you done . You ai n't got any choice nohow . We was just givin you a chance to do this of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | you appreciate it when white folks try to help you . But we got a strict court order right here ? " he whipped from his pocket a document , ornamented , stamped and varicolored , and unfolded it before Henry . " Can you read ? " " Nawsuh , " said Henry meekly . " Thought not . " With a glance at Mr. Abe , the sheriff returned the document to his pocket . " Well , this here paper says you got to work fo Mr. Turner till you work out the amount o your criminal offense . " " How long is that till ? " " Mr. Turner will let you know . " 20 At the end of August , Mr. Turner still had n't let him know . Living at Martha 's shack and eating off her generosity , Henry found a rueful pleasure in being out of jail and in town . He enjoyed occasional visits with George and May and chats with Miss Lucy , but most of the evenings he sat on the porch with Martha , looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life . All his family bitterly resented his predicament , but he persisted in refusing help . " I brung it on myself , an ai n't no use gettin any o you tangled up in it , " he would say . " Maybe it is a fake order , I guess it is  --  but we cai n't do nothin . . . nothin but do what they say . " Early , while the morning was fairly cool , he would walk to the store and until closing time at six he would be hopping and skipping to every smallest command of his boss . For always behind Mr. Abe 's looks or words was the threat of law , the reminder of guilt , the suggestion of authority . Do what he would , Henry could never please , unless , as he soon guessed from the glint in Mr. Abe 's eyes , he did it wrong . Besides the cleaning , which included the McLain section of the combined stores , and the usual chores , Henry had many other jobs which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock had to be shifted : barrels of staples to the rear  | and hardware to the front ; and the following week they must be reversed . Goods on top shelves must exchange places with those on the bottom . When Henry mixed the jugs of molasses with jugs of vinegar , Mr. Abe fumed and grumbled , " Do n't think you can trick me out of a gallon of molasses , nigger ! " One day the long heavy counter had to be moved to the opposite side of the room , and if a customer entered in the confusion , Mr. Abe would swear , provided it was n't a lady , and call Henry slow , lazy , clumsy , stupid . He would send him on useless errands , running as if they were important ; or to bring soda pop from the drug store ? Mr. Abe would telephone them to charge it ; or to mend the roof , hammering down heat-loosened sheets on the scorching griddle of corrugated metal ; or to wash the display windows and paint the trim in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , Henry would have wondered slightly why Mr. Abe had made the arrangements to get him out of jail , for nothing met with approval , but rather with an increasing picayunish criticism , and later with insults and threats of whipping and lawsuits . " I ought a throw you back in jail to rot , " Mr. Abe growled many times . " Don know why I ever took the trouble to get you out . You niggers gettin out o place since that coon beat Jim Jeffries an married a white woman . " And such phrases as " black son of a bitch " and " nigger bastard " and others obscene as only the excited brain of hatred creates poured over Henry from time to time with an insistence that his well-trained spirit could not entirely slough off . Instead of a response dulled to a shrug of disdain , such as he used to make , he now felt the twinge of a scrape on skin abraded from former toughness to the quick . If this , too , were part of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered about his release . But there was something more important . Mr. Abe had become a cotton buyer , as he hinted he would , and intended to use the loading platform behind the grocery for temporary storage of the bales . The platform , with a thin shed projecting over half of it , spread from the back of the store , along the side wall of McLain 's store , which extended , unlike Mr. Abe 's , as far as the alley . A narrow strip of boarding , on piles rising higher and higher where the wide creek bed curved under it and against the building foundations , connected the main platform with the back door beside the desk . Since many of the boards had warped in the sun and  | rotted in rain , the platform had to him over a week , in spare time , to saw the thick planks in proper lengths , rip up the bad ones and nail down the new , so that the platform was usable . And now that the cotton bolls  --  those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had split and fluffed out white in the late summer sun , and the field hands had picked them and the crop had been ginned and baled , the wagons day after day pulled up to this loading stage to empty . At the sight of the farmer , Mr. Abe would stride out , yelling to Henry to come roll the bales off the wagon , and stand haggling over purchase terms while he drew cotton fibers between his finger tips in imitation of an expert appraiser . Sometimes the farmer brought a Negro along who would help Henry to heave the bales side over side , and maneuver them , rolling with soft clumps , toward the spraddling giant insect of the scale . Sometimes even the farmer would give a hand , in spite of Mr. Abe 's assertion that Henry could handle them alone . It was all he could do to manage with no help but a broad hand-truck to trundle them . Half the time he could move the bales with the long hook slapped into the top to pull them over when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flat on the floor , he had to lift and push . Often his back seemed to tear apart , and his thighs were strained and sore from the squatting , bending , tugging exertion . After the bales were weighed and set aside , they were never in the right or safe place . If a dark cloud appeared , Mr. Abe wanted them shoved farther under the shed so that rain would n't blow in on them . Certain bales had to be loaded on the wagon and hauled to storage until prices rose higher ; others must be taken to the depot for shipment to Memphis . When the platform got jammed , Mr. Abe sounded as if he thought Henry ought to stack some of the bales on top of others . " I nigh bout bust my guts jus pushin em , Mr. Abe , " said Henry . " Well , I got to have more room . Jacob Wilkins is comin with six more and we ca n't even get to the scales to weigh them . " With the season drawing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumpy , as if something was constantly biting him , but  | Henry managed to keep an even temper in the face of the irrational outbursts . First thing every morning , Mr. Abe was engrossed in the cotton-market page of the Memphis paper , jerking his eyes from one column to another in comparisons and calculations , and then folding the paper to swat it on his leg with an exclamation of disgust or pleasure . If Henry asked a question about his work , the answer would be , " Do n't bother me ! Get to work ! " in a tone that often suggested that a half-cent drop in quotations was in some peculiar way Henry 's fault . Mr. Abe would dash down the street to another cotton buyer , to a gin on the outskirts , to a lawyer , for inexplicable conferences ; only on his return to suspect Henry of stealing while he was gone . Many times , he demanded that Henry turn out all his pockets and once , insisting that Henry had tucked some dress goods under his clothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild protest ? " But Mr. Abe , do n't you trus me ? " ? was comical to the storekeeper , but something malicious underlay his laugh . On Saturday afternoon when Mr. Wilkins ' load of cotton was expected , Mr. Abe muttered something like , " Maybe I better not take it , ' less I find out " ; and a moment later snatched up his hat , said , " I 'm goin to telegraph Memphis , " and rushed down the street to the depot . Shortly afterward , Henry saw a shadow move across the boards outside the back door . Columbus appeared in the opening , peeping in cautiously , and Henry noticed a small watermelon in the curve of his arm . They sat together on the strip of platform over the slope of the creek and cut the melon into lengthwise quarters . " I turnt the ice-cream freezer today for Miz Murchison an she give it to me , " Columbus explained . " Let me lick the paddle too . I ' as goin to see my girl Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then I thought you 'd be hot down here workin , an closer'n home or Irene , an thought this melon 'd go good right now . " They bit into the pink wedges , feeling the juicy pulp not cold but refreshing against their lips and tongues . They blew out and spat the seeds over the edge of the platform into the wide sloping basin below where the creek flowed in a shallow meander . " How 's yo ma ? " Henry listened as thirstily as he ate while the boy told him about Annie  --  no news much , but it was sweet to hear that she was relieved at his release from jail and pleased  | at his job . She probably did n't know the terms of his work ; he had n't had the courage to see her , for he still felt he was in prison or worse . Maybe later , when he was free of his debt and his guilt , he could approach her again . They finished the melon and Henry threaded with his son through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You be careful with that Irene , " he said jokingly , as the boy jumped off and went down the alley . " All right , " called Columbus , " but you did n't say be good ! " Then Henry heard Mr. Abe shouting and turned to see him emerge hastily from the back door , step on a melon rind , skid and fall on the other rinds . Henry had himself a quick delicious laugh before the curses poured out to drown his amusement . Furious and dismayed , Mr. Abe scrambled up , his tan seersucker suit wet in spots and glued here and there with seeds ; and after a finicky brush at the spoiled cloth , he seized a rind and hurled it at Henry . " I could have broke my back , you goddam fool son of a bitchin nigger , " the man roared . " What you doin eatin watermelons out here anyhow ? Guess you stole it from up front . You 'll be workin for me all your life at this rate  --  payin for ruinin my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apologize and explain , Mr. Abe grabbed another rind and mashed it in Henry 's face . " Now clean up all this mess , " he shouted . " An scrub it with soap an water . Be drawin flies from all over town . " Wiping his face , Henry tried to control his actions , as Mr. Abe , mumbling , entered the store . He kicked the rinds into the creek bed and brought out a broom and pail of water . Now alone , he felt his stifled fury mounting , vibrating and thrashing for release and blurring his vision . By the time Mr. Wilkins ' wagon arrived , he had become somewhat quiet again . Mr. Abe , apparently satisfied with his telegram , told Henry to line up the bales along the wall on the neck of the platform and then invited Mr. Wilkins inside the store . Henry trundled three bales into place without too much difficulty , but after that the narrowing strip and the uneven boards made it hard to curve the truck to the right spot against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a squeeze that one truck wheel clung to the outer edge of the platform and he had no purchase from which to shove and turn the truck . He  | would have to leave it and roll the bales , side over side , with one end projecting over the edge , and hope that , at the best angle for swerving it , the broad side would be upright . If that happened , he could pull it , pivoting , toward the wall with the hook ; otherwise , with the flat side down and hanging over , he had no foothold to push from . Maybe Mr. Abe could decide on something else , he thought , and went to ask ; but Mr. Abe said gruffly that he was busy with customers . " Get back on that job  --  it 's got to be done before closing . " Outside Henry leaned against a bale and wiped his face on his forearm . He was shaking from strain . In exasperation he glanced from the bales to the space intended for them . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth bale by the wall . He was rolling the next one down when Mr. Abe appeared . " What the hell 's eatin you ? " he demanded . " They 're fittin in there all right . " " But see , I cai n't swing em around up at that end , " said Henry , panting , as he stopped work and indicated the problem with his hand . " Well , there 's no other place . They got to go there . " Defeated , Henry simply looked at him . " Well , come on ! Mr. Wilkins 'll be back for his wagon soon an you still got another one . " Henry shook his head in disgust and bent to lift the bottom corner of the bale . It rolled and gave its soft rumble as it settled on its side . " You ai n't pushin it straight , " said Mr. Abe . " It 's got a go that way , so I can wheel it around . " Mr. Abe glared without replying . Henry shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry boards . He slapped the hook in and strained to pull the bale over . " That 's too far out , " said Mr. Abe . Henry scowled across the bale at him . " It 's got a go near halfway out or it wo n't turn in right . " " You ai n't got the gumption to handle it . " " I put the others where they is . " " Do n't talk back to me , nigger . Get to work . " Henry turned the bale once more . " It 's goin crooked ! " Henry began to shake . " You want a do it yo'self , Mr. Abe ? "  | " By God ? " But Mr. Abe did not finish . It was as if the blood that flooded his face had choked him . After a moment he managed to say , " Go ahead . Get it done . " When the next roll set the bale almost half off the platform , Henry stooped for the hook to swerve it toward the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The side of the bale rose toward Henry , but the overhanging end dipped and the other end rose upward from the boards . It teetered slowly . Mr. Abe shouted . " It 's goin over ! Hold it ! " Henry snatched out the hook and dug it into the sinking end of the bale , but it caught only cotton . The bulk swung sedately over the edge , thumped on the weeds below and tumbled down the bank to lie in the creek bed . The hook dangled from his hand with a white fluff of cotton caught on its point . Henry gazed downward sickly . After a long silence , Mr. Abe spoke . " Well , go on down there an haul it back . I do n't want it to soak up all the water in the creek . " " Mr. Abe , you know I cai n't get that up here by myself . " " Well , you gon na have to . " " It jus cai n't be done . You know that . Have to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on purpose , " shouted Mr. Abe . " Nawsuh  --  nawsuh , I did n't . " " I know you niggers  --  stinkin-ass sons o bitches ! Sure you did it on purpose . " He turned abruptly and went into the store . Before Henry could gather his thoughts , Mr. Abe was back , clutching a buggy whip and saying , " Get up against that wall . " Unable to believe what he heard and saw , suddenly unable to imagine that this was not a dream , along with everything that had happened since he ran off with Luella , and that he would not awaken in the creaking swing on the porch in Rosson Row , hot in the late summer air and sighing with the pleasure of awakening to life , Henry did not move . The whip snapped sharply across his middle and the cord at the end wrapped stinging at his wrist . " Get over there . " " No . " In the midst of his terror , Henry knew a flash of joy , unexplainable but soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown bigger and prouder , and then it was gone back into darkness .  | Mr. Abe raised the whip again . " Do n't you hit me no mo . " " Do what I say , nigger . " Henry 's right hand , with the cotton-tipped hook , was rising when the whip cut again . He tightened all over and then , as the stings came more and more , seemed to burst . His arm flung out , up , and crashed the hook at Mr. Abe 's head time after time . The stinging ended , and the white man lay at his feet with blood creeping over his forehead and cheeks . Henry dropped the hook and ran down the alley . 21 As she walked leisurely toward town on the shady side of the street so as not to get overheated , Annie hummed to herself . " Rufus Rastus Johnson Brown , What you gon na do when the rent comes round ? What you gon na say ? How you gon na pay ? . . . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the heat of the day had begun to lessen and they had sat on the porch drinking lemonade and gossipping until shortly before sundown . Since she paid such visits periodically , it was n't that alone which caused her to hum ; it was the confirmation of what she had suspected for several weeks , but dared not question because those Burtons were so finicky about manners . Today they had admitted it  --  May was pregnant ; and Annie had cried , " Well , land 's sakes alive , why did n't you say so long ago ! I 've knowed it fo a coon 's age . " She hugged May and their conversation took a fresh spurt that kept her so late she had n't time to call on Aunt Martha . About two blocks from town , three white men came loping up the walk toward her , and she drew aside , saying to herself they 'd have a sunstroke for such foolishness . Then she thought how odd it was that , though they were running , they had looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those newfangled buggies , the automobile , raced up the street and behind it a couple of carriages and a sulky , the drivers lashing the horses  | almost to a gallop . Annie hesitated and with all her senses suddenly acute , realized that something had happened . A great hollow seemed to gape inside her , and she put a hand on the iron fence , just to make contact with something real , because intuitively she knew now that whatever it was that happened was unreal and dreadful . Then she went with quickened steps the remaining distance to the main street and halted uneasily just off the broad walk at the corner of a building . The tenseness could be seen and heard and even almost smelled : clerks and storekeepers , ready to close up shop , stood in the doors gazing and awed ; men were scurrying along the walks , and hopping across the railroad tracks to join them , most of them headed in the same direction  --  toward the McLain &; Turner Merchandise Company , where a swarming crowd and a knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway across the street . From there a muffled roar swirled in the bowl of silence round about , and once or twice a shout rose above the sustained throbbing . On the sweltering puff of air that just then surprisingly swelled between the rows of stores , came an undefinable odor , animal-like , offal-like , and very faint ; and though Annie knew she 'd better get out of sight , she could not move yet . A young lady emerged from a stairwell between nearby stores and , followed by a dentist in his white apron , approached the clerks closest to the corner . Annie shrank farther back and against the wall . " What on earth ? " the young lady asked . " Dr. Willets had my mouth just jammed with gadgets and ? " " The nigger in Mr. Turner 's store just killed him . " " Oh how awful ! How ? " " Split his head with an axe . " " No , it was a razor , I heard , " corrected someone . " Slashed his throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " said a lady 's trembling voice . " Poor Mrs. Turner . " " They will , " said a man . " He ai n't been gone more'n fifteen minutes . He ca n't get far . " To Annie the late sunshine grew dense and blackened and she leaned against the wall trying to draw in a breath . The air was scorching , acrid , solid and would not feed her lungs . She knew  | she was not fainting , only stunned by terror , blinded and paralyzed by pity and wonder ; and all of them wound together then into a vast remembrance of love . She tried to think , but least of all of help , which she knew to be futile , and as she thought Henry , my Henry , what can I do ? , the sunshine gradually reappeared to her eyes as a yellow streak on the ruddy brick wall opposite , with a dark iris about the edge of her vision ; and when she saw in the wall a window with a face peering out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , glaring , pressing , angry . She hurried across the sidewalk , the street , the railroad tracks , to get quickly as far as possible from this center of fury . Like all others of her kind , she would have to cringe indoors until calmness returned . In Possum Hollow , the porches were vacant . No children played in the alley or the yards . The doors were closed and there was no sound of talk or song . When she entered her house , she hoped to find Columbus or Tobe , but no one was there . She wanted company , comforting , but something kept her from leaving the house . She sat a long time in her chair , motionless in the suffocating air , with moisture trickling unnoticed down her face . The shop whistle blew , shocking in the broad silence , and having stirred at the intrusion of reality into the gathering dream of her thoughts , she folded her hands together . The sun had vanished and the long twilight was dying . With her hands still clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pray . But in a moment she crumpled , sinking back and bending slowly over her hands until her body formed a rounded mass shaken by her sobs . It was long after , how long she could not tell , but her tears had stopped , leaving her wound in an insensitive state , and night had come , blackening everything but the faint rectangles of the windows , when a sound wakened her nerves . A tapping ? the balls of the fingers , the nails  --  on the back door brought her stumbling from her cramped position . A hoarse voice whispered her name . And as the door swung with a gentle whine , she was running to the kitchen and then her arms hungrily enfolded Henry , panting , shivering and weak . At first he almost slid through her embrace to the floor , as his knees gave way , but he clung to her and leaned against the wall . " Annie ! " he breathed . " I wanted to see you . I jus wanted to hold you ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh where can I hide you ! " She framed his face , burning with the fever of his running , in her hands and brushed over his temples . " No . They got the hounds  --  I heard em from up on standpipe hill . They 'll be here . " " You ought a ran way off right at first . To the woods  --  the swamp  --  somewhere . " " There ai n't no place now , Annie , " he said . " I jus wanted to see you once more . " For a moment she nestled her head on his shoulder . There was nothing to be said , nothing to be done . He held her with his cheek tucked against hers , brushing together like the cheeks of two shy , very young , lovers , and then pulled away . " I got a run . " She clutched at his arm , and the sleeve rasped through her fingers as he darted out and his figure shrank swiftly into the darkness and after a series of soft splashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the silence contracted like a vise about her , squeezing out her breath and blood and soul , and she stood transfixed in the doorway and watched him running from her into the night over and over as if the touch and sight of him must never vanish , and her lips kept shaping his name to call him back . When the first bay of the hounds reached her , coming dimly across the Hollow as they rounded a hilltop , she went in to the hearth and sat in her rocking chair . The noise , a subdued vibration , a rustling , as if a party of genteel folk were trying not to disturb their neighbors , drew nearer with a sporadic yelp from the dogs , a call from a man . It moved along the rear of the line of shacks and , now closer , was more insistent , more filled with tension . Annie reached for the box of matches on the table and held them . The dogs , the voices , reached the open back door and vague lights shone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp wick just as the men entered . The two hounds , leashed and dragging their owner , bounded with strangling cries to her chair and sniffed and snapped their flapping jaws . The man contrived to keep them barely away , and Annie sat rigid while the room filled with white faces and a bristle of shotguns.  | " Where is he ? " shouted someone who seemed to be the leader . " He ai n't here , " said Annie . The men swarmed about , snatching down curtains , tumbling the mattresses , opening doors and knocking things over . " Where is he , woman ? " " He ai n't here , I said . " The man slapped her cheek . " Don get insultin . We 'll take you along with us . Where 'd he go ? " " I don know . " A voice called that the hounds would pick up his trail and other voices agreed . " We 're wastin time here . Let 's go . " And somehow all the men disappeared and the disheveled room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie sat still , waiting , trancelike , her eyes wide and dry , her features tightly set , and knew no thought or sensation . She listened . . . listened ... . From far away the bark of gunshots came at last , one and another and a dozen and more and faster and grew to a thunder . She stiffened and drew up and her hands gripped the armrest . But the endless roar ceased and the world crashed down on her limp body and tore at her closed eyes . After a while she began slowly to rock the chair . 22 Under the sharply conical roof , topped by a weathervane , the clock in the round tower of the corner bank indicated six-fifty . The light was almost gone from the sky by now ; it settled sadly over the emptying streets , the last late wagons moving away and the sputtering autos hurrying homeward . Above them on each side rose the lacy maze of wires , scalloping far down the street from pole to pole , each topped by five bars bumpy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of swallows cutting the dim sky and returning to the mulberry trees behind the hotel . The canvas awnings before the busi-  | ness houses had been drawn up and the bare-faced rows of doors and windows seemed , in spite of the paint and lettering , long forsaken and forgotten . It was that in-between time when only the last stragglers to supper were on the sidewalks and the twilight covered all . Later , the street lights would come on and the fronts of a few drug stores and cafes would glow until nine o'clock , and the multicolored bulbs around the notion store that was converted into a moving-picture theatre would announce that it was open for customers to come and see Bronco Billy and John Bunny . George quickened his steps , for he was late getting off tonight . Lincoln had come home that afternoon to stay a few days , and Miss Lucy was cooking a special supper . His letter had said he was going up North to work , said he was sick of the South . Wondering uneasily what their mutual attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block above the McLain &; Turner Merchandise Company . His detour was automatic now , for since his father was killed he had never been able to pass the store and see Mr. Abe , with no visible signs of Henry 's blows except a drawn-up shoulder , sitting in his hickory chair at the door , talking crops and prices and elections , and month after month growing stouter as his business and income grew larger . For a whole year he had been conscious of his hatred each time he walked down the business street where he might any moment encounter Mr. Abe , alive and well , having suffered a concussion , a broken collarbone and shoulder , a torn ear and some slashes in the back where the hook 's point caught ; and if he should meet him , he was afraid he might be tempted to finish what Henry had not done but had paid for with his life . In time , however , his angry fear passed and then he considered going to the store with Columbus  --  for Mr. Abe would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lynching never went back to work , even for the pay due him  --  and both of them would stand at the curb silently staring at Mr. Abe . Yet they gave up that idea , realizing it would accomplish nothing , and at length their longing for redress , or at least exoneration of their father as a murderer , was submerged by their daily problems . For George knew all the while that his father was dead not because he murdered , or raped or even insulted a white lady , but simply because he struck back . He and May had seen the report  | in the paper . The tall headlines , just below the motto " Justice , Truth and God , " said : " NEGRO BRUTE COMMITS SUICIDE BY COWARDLY ATTACK ON WHITE MAN , " and they could read no further . But when they read the editorial that appeared the following week , they had no doubts as to the interpretation of the unspecific apologetic tone . " The Herald is the friend of the colored man , " it began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But remember  --  the white man is the most cruel and savage beast that inhabits the earth . God made him such . He will rule in his sphere or he will die in the attempt . Arouse his hatred and animosity and he will exterminate you . Ile has cruelly destroyed every race and people that has challenged his right to rule . But remember , if the white man can be cruel , he can also be just . " Then there followed directions on how to insure this justice , but they were too familiar to George and May to rouse them to the desire . Both agreed from the beginning never to let any of their families know what the paper had said ; all of them had suffered enough already . Though Annie had borne up well , George could now guess what she felt without showing it . In the dawn after the lynching , a day when few Negroes appeared at their jobs , she went with Mamie James and Tobe across the creek out back and up the bluffs . Tobe told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of her sorrow , and led them on over the paths , through brush and fields , intent on finding him before the buzzards did , and positive through some inner sense that she knew where he lay , and asking anxiously , " They 've gone by now , do n't you reckon ? They wo n't keep us from im ? " When she noticed that Tobe had brought a spade , she begged , " Cai n't we bring im back to the church graveyard ? " But that , Tobe and Mamie agreed , might cause trouble if the white folks found out ; they 'd better attract as little attention as possible . They passed Lily Johns 's house , deep in a green cluster of branches , and went on up a hill rising with woods and thorny berry thickets . " It:s up there , I think , " said Annie . They came out into a small clearing where a toppling , halfburned shack stood in a field of trampled grass . The glimpse of a fleeing animal could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the grass and then at the charred gaping end of the shack . Through it , on the other side , they could  | see something drooping in the open doorway . " Go see , Tobe , " she said . " If it ai n't too bad , I 'll . . . " When he had cut the ropes that held Henry 's arms up to each doorjamb , and folded the body in the ragged quilt Mamie had brought , he returned to Annie and shook his head . " Le 's bury im here , " she said . " It 's quiet an lonesome . He wo n't be bothered . " While Tobe dug the grave , Annie sat beside the shrouded form . Mamie , tiny beside her buxom figure , circled her in her arms when Tobe dragged it to the brink and tried to let it fall in neatly . The quilt broke away and showed dimly in the pit a part of what had been the face . Annie crouched at the edge and leaned over , calling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Tobe said a prayer and covered him with earth . They were halfway home , he said , when Annie began in a low tone to curse the white folks in an unbelievable stream of deliberate words that ended only when they came in sight of Possum Hollow . George kept remembering all that Tobe had told him , but more often he remembered the smile that he and his father had exchanged through the jail bars , the smile that spoke their selfreliance and also its conscious betrayal in a way their words could not . It had been , he realized now that death brought back all his memories of Henry , the same as when they sat on the back steps after his dispute with Albert Rosson about a marble . Justice sunken under the code , and the smile of their secret strength , their only solace . " I whupped him , Pa , " echoed from childhood ; but why not after childhood ? Because their lessons were taught only once , and a reminder was all that was needed afterward . At night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and say to himself , " It 's wrong  --  wrong . You knew it was wrong , Pa , tha 's why you smiled . To comfort yourself . An it killed you . Why did you teach me that ? To teach my sons when they grow up ? Why did n't you teach me how to get out of it ? It 's wrong . It 's a trap . It 's The Trap  --  the white man 's trap . " Then at his restless movements , May would waken by his side and ask what was the matter and he would answer , " I was thinkin about Pa . " She would put her arms around him and tell him not to fret so much  --  they would get over it . And because he did n't want to worry her , now that she was carrying his child , he would lie still , trying to sleep , and thinking , " Why is there  | always a trap ? Was Pa right after all ? Everybody do n't get caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " And now the baby was almost a year old , and before long there would be another . The birth had been difficult for May , as Mrs. Fielder , the midwife , predicted on the basis of the waning moon , and all her remedies seemed of no avail . For some weeks May had drunk milkweed tea , but her breasts did not noticeably swell . During several days previous to the birth , the women in the family , Miss Lucy , Aunt Martha or Annie , had bathed her loins with warm dishwater , and the midwife had tied a red string around May 's waist when her labor approached , to give her strength . At the crucial point , when the pains were recurrent and May 's cries seemed constant , whether voiced or smothered to moans , the baby did not emerge . Mrs. Fielder kept saying , " Jus keep washin her lines with that water . I 'll make a ellum-bark poultice to go under the small of her back . That 'll make the baby come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hours ? and the women hurried in and out with basins , cloths and bottles  --  of some herbal potion , he supposed . In distraction , he caught Annie 's arm on one of her passages and said he 'd better go for Dr. Murchison . " She be all right , " said Annie . " She jus ai n't used to it yet . We can manage . " " But it do n't do no good . A baby do n't take that long  --  it 's been over two hours . She 'll die . I 'm goin fo Doctor Tom . " But Doctor Tom made excuses and tried to reassure George of the midwife 's skill and May 's strength . " You colored people never have any real trouble at birth , " he consoled . Though George pled with him , all he could get was a smile and a promise to come by sometime later on . The baby was already born when the doctor arrived ; and after saying a few pleasant words and remarking that the boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An I thought he was our friend , " George grumbled . " He is , George , " said Annie . " He come when Ma died , an to see Cora . An Miz Doctor Tom do all sorts o things fo us . " " Not the right things at the right time . " " We got a learn to live without depending on them . " " And they want a live without botherin about us. "  | " He 's gettin old , he 's tired , George . He ai n't long fo this world . " When May felt stronger they discussed names for the baby . Miss Lucy suggested Theodore Roosevelt , after the President , but everyone laughed at that . " How 'll he ever spell it ? " said George , though he was thinking how easy it would be for the boy to be nicknamed Theo . " Ai n't no worse , " Miss Lucy retorted , " than yo name Murchison . " May proposed St. Elmo , at which George hooted that it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a Bible name , " said Annie , " something real pretty , like Isaiah or Zekial . " " They 's real ole-fashioned , " was the general objection to that . May motioned George to her side and whispered ; then George announced : " May wants to name im Henry . She said if Ma wanted a Bible one , maybe Daniel would do fo the middle . " Though Annie protested that part of the name should be for the Burton side , it was all too obvious from her gleaming eyes that she was touched and delighted . " The next kid can have a Burton name , " said George . " You jus countin too many chickens , Mistuh Mu'chison , " said May with a giggle , and added as she bundled up the baby , " Henry Daniel , go to yo pa . " It was dark by the time George reached Rosson Row , and he hurried into the house to greet Lincoln and wash up and change from his work clothes before supper . Yes , Lincoln was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkening with coal dust , over his face and arms ; changed , or developed maybe , into a hightoned sport , a Mr. Muckty-Muck , with his fancy suit and striped shirt and what seemed , even in the small living room of his own home , a faint swagger and arrogance . The condescending smile , the mocking look , the assured stance with hands on hips , when , after they shook hands , Lincoln surveyed him , all foretold the nature of his remarks during the meal . " When are you goin to leave those shops an get a decent job where you can keep clean ? " Lincoln asked . " It 's good pay , " said George , stinging , " an there ai n't many jobs to get . " " You 've had dirty jobs in New Orleans , ai n't you ? " asked May . " You was a stevedore , an a stableboy . ... " " Yeah , an worse too , " replied Lincoln . " Sometimes you look clean but the work 's filthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slop jars an carryin out bloody guts ? "  | " Lincoln ! " cried Miss Lucy . " Not at the table . Mind yo manners . " Well , all right . But I ai n't a kid no more . I 've seen a lot an I know a thing or two . I 'm goin up North where I can do what I like an work at any job I want to . " Miss Lucy laughed , and May said , " Pooh , you ai n't really goin . " But George thought Let him go , knowing that he no longer felt anything  --  not warmth , or fun , or envy , or regret  --  for Lincoln . " I am goin  --  I got my ticket right through to Chicago . " " Silas James says you ca n't get all them jobs up there , " said George . " Who 's he ? What 's he know about it ? " " He 's jus come back from Chicago . He says you can get some jobs but mostly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell  --  he don know everything . I got some connections  --  met a lot o folks in New Orleans from up there . " " I hope they 's hones ' folks , " sighed Miss Lucy . " Some of em is white folks , " explained Lincoln . " They 're big , rich , important people . " " I still hopes they 's honest . " Lincoln glanced inquisitively at his mother , and they were all silent . When George asked what he thought of the baby , Lincoln was unenthusiastic , and May accounted for it by telling that Lincoln had married too . " Stayed married a year , " Lincoln said . " But it kept me tied down too much , so I left her . She 's got a baby  --  mine , I guess . " Through the evening George was uncomfortable with his childhood friend , frequently trying to recall what it was that made them friends years ago , and talking with an effort to restrain his annoyance at the new character he sensed in Lincoln . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing tales of Lincoln 's life in the city , the wild times he had there , the women he slept with , the white prostitute who admitted him on idle afternoons , and though Lincoln summed it all up as something of an educational introduction to the real freedom he was going to find in Chicago , George cringed just as he had done when he listened to Lincoln tell of Miss Hebe Dalton and stood with him peering at her windows . And once again he felt relieved when after three days Lincoln ,  | saying a jaunty good-bye and urging them to follow soon , was finally gone . Then Miss Lucy sank onto the sofa and wagged her head deprecatingly and murmured , " I hopes that boy don get into no trouble . " On Sunday they strolled over to Possum Hollow to call on Annie . Mamie James and her son , Silas , were there , and the womenfolk gathered inside with the baby , leaving the porch to the men . Tobe brought out a bowl of fresh-dug peanuts and they popped open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ate . " First raw peanuts I 've had in five or six years , " said Silas . Silas had returned from the North that spring and was living with his mother . Shamefully he confessed that he had not completed his law course , having failed two examinations and , as a result , had lost his benefactor . On the other hand , Mamie proudly told everyone , " He had to read books thousands o pages long  --  whole rows of em . He 's real smart . " Silas always explained that the degree did n't matter much , because he would have had a hard time finding any law practice . " I can use what I learned down here where colored folks do n't always understand what 's happening to them , " he said . " But I 'll have to make a living some other way  --  maybe teaching school . " Teaching would be the right job for a man like Silas , George thought ; with his college training , his small frame , like Mamie 's , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard manual labor . The look on his face too  --  placid and serious , except that his eyes often darted keenly and mirthfully about  --  suggested a teacher ; and he bore his head , its kinks clipped almost to baldness , with dignity and walked at a slow ruminative pace . When George at last mentioned the ideas that Lincoln had expressed , Silas smiled tolerantly . " He ai n't talking about freedom  --  real freedom , " he said , rocking easily in the warm autumn sunshine and tossing peanuts into his mouth . " That 's inside , the way you feel . He 's talking about sex  --  that kind of freedom , and he 's looking for it just like looking for dope . He 's trying to hide from what he does feel . He ai n't never going to hide far enough away . " " But ai n't there real freedom up there ? " asked Tobe . " Sometimes  --  one place or another . Everybody says we 're free  | ? the white folks , the colored folks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe the slaves could feel it , it gave them something new . But now it 's different . It 's there on the law books , but we got to climb up and grab it , and hold it inside you . It 's not inside me yet , I do n't feel it all through . Something holds me down , like a weight , a heavy chain . . . . " Silas leaned back in the rocker , his broad rounded lips firm and immobile , his wide-set eyes gazing steadily ahead , his hands in his lap and his ankles crossed , very much the picture of his mother Mamie when she came to visit . " Cai n't you tell what it is , " George said at last , " that holds you down ? " " I can , " said Tobe . " It 's jus white folks bein aroun , pure an simple . " Silas tittered gleefully . " That 's pretty good , Tobe , even if you did n't mean it that way . Anyhow " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than white folks . " " Well , what ? " persisted George , when Silas did not continue . " Do n't you know ? " " Not for sure , " Silas answered hesitantly . " I can just guess around . The funny thing I run on was , I found out I could n't feel free  --  free the way we mean it  --  all alone . If I was getting out of prison , yeah , I could . But if I broke out , I 'd always be scared and jumpy and running , and not free even outside , because they could always put me back . It 's got to be everybody feeling the same way  --  everybody feeling free  --  or nobody is . " The sounds , up to now half-heard , of the women indoors , laughing and making over the baby , were wiped out and on George 's mind those words froze incandescent . The three men were hushed , sunk in meditation , when the women surged onto the porch to rout them from their seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie , kicking Tobe 's feet gently , " an let a lady set down . Ya 'll takin up the whole po'ch . " " Well , you said you wanted to stay inside where you could talk hen-talk , " replied Tobe , as he gave up his chair . He dropped from the porch to the ground and , sinking back on the boards with his shoulders against a post , stretched his legs down the edge . George and Silas moved to sit on the floor with their feet on the steps . " I jus did n't want a nu'se Henry Daniel out in plain sight o  | God an ev'ybody , " said May , as she patted the baby 's back and sat in the rickety swing . " Goober hulls all over the place , " cried Annie , surveying the litter underfoot . Then she saw the ruffled flounces of Miss Lucy 's long skirt sweep over the planks , toward the vacant place beside May , and she exclaimed , " Uh-uh ! Don set there , Miss Lucy ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ai n't that plump , Miss Annie , " she laughed , and chose another seat . " Le ' me hol ' that chile some . " Annie reached for the baby and began to play with him . " I 'll set with May , " said Mamie , " I 'm kind o on the scrawny side . " " This po'ch jus ai n't big enough , " complained Tobe . " We spillin off jus like cowpeas off'n a knife . Good thing C'lumbus ai n't here too . " " Is he really thinking about going to the Delta ? " asked Silas . " Nex cotton-pickin , he says , " replied Annie . " Course tha 's some months off . " " He did n't want to go on to school , " Silas remarked as a sad question . " Mr. James , " said Miss Lucy with a laugh , " I jus cai n't get over yo Yankee accent . " " It 'll ruin you with the white folks , " said Tobe . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas . " Where 's C'lumbus now ? " asked Mamie . " Out spoonin , I reckon . Where you reckon ? " " In the spring a young man 's fancy , ' " quoted Silas lightly . " He ai n't so fancy , pickin that Irene Canfield to walk out with , " scoffed Annie . She jounced the baby on her knees and gurgled , " Oh you little sugar lump ! " Holding her hand above him , finger pointed down and circling , while the fascinated eyes followed it , she intoned , " Ro-oly holey holey holey " ? growing faster and louder and the finger sinking ? " **25;204;TOOLONG BAD MAN ! " with that her finger pecked at the baby 's stomach and Henry Daniel crowed and kicked his legs . " H , gon na be some lucky gal 's sheet-kicker , jus like is granpa ! " cried Annie , and shook his belly under her palm . As the women began to chatter among themselves , Tobe swung  | his legs around and off the porch and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , you hear any talk in yo part o the shops about a raise ? " " Nobody said nothin to me about it . " " I don reckon they 'll say it to you , " said Tobe . " You prob'ly wo n't get one anyhow , when the white men do . They got the ' union . " " What 's that ? " Tobe and Silas tried to explain , and then Tobe told of overhearing his engineer and another talking about some complaint against the railroad company , not giving salary increases and refusing to deal with their union , and even not recognizing their right to organize . " I ai n't heard anybody talkin like that . " " Well , " said Silas , " you ca n't belong to the local here , so it wo n't matter to you much . It 's all liable to peter out anyhow . " " But suppose they do strike , " said George , " what do we do ? Do we quit too ? " " It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I know . Is that right , Tobe ? " " That 's the way I hears it from them as been in em . You can quit yo job , but the local ai n't gon help you eat like they do their members . Or you can go on workin an eatin an be called a scab . " " Hell , " George said . " What you gon do , Tobe ? " " I don know . Ai n't no strike on yet . " He stood up and stretched his limbs . " We got a go on eatin , I guess . Long as we don count one way or th'other . " A chilly breeze wandered across them and they noticed that the sun was hovering above the jagged fringe of treetops in the west . Miss Lucy rose and began drawing on her light cloak . " Come on , chil'ren . We must n't keep Henry Daniel out in the night air . " " Good time o year fo catchin croup , " Annie agreed , as she handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . " Let is pa carry im , " May said . " He do n't have to tote im aroun all day like I do , an fiddle with is didies an nursin an all . " George cuddled the infant against his breast and , as the whimpering began , jogged him easily in his arms . " Now do n't you cry , Henry Danny , or I 'll paddle yo ta-la-loolie-aye. "  | " An I 'll paddle your'n too , if you do , " May threatened . " Do n't you lift a hand to our chile , " said Annie . " Our little angel puss , " she crooned over the puckered crying face . " He 's hungry , " said George , offering to return the baby . " He jus fed a hour ago , " said May . " You scare im , tha 's all . " She touched his arm to urge him toward the gate . " Come on , Ma , " she called , for Miss Lucy had again relapsed into conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papa ? " asked George indignantly . " Y'all come back real soon , " said Annie . " ' Joyed yo visit , " said Tobe . " Come an see us sometime , " said Miss Lucy . And while the others called good-bye , she hastened to catch up with George and May . 23 Over the months the unrest among the railroad workers , which was spreading long before Tobe mentioned it to George , increased at a hardly perceptible rate . The atmosphere in the shops and rail yards gradually became charged with uneasiness and distemper . Some of the workers seemed to brood and scowl ; and when others cursed and bashed a wrench on a wheel rim or slammed a metal sheet to the floor , it sounded not like their casual daily outbursts but like a special protest . Yet positive action was fettered by arguments , irresolution and a general lack of united purpose . Soon the Negro laborers were discussing the possible impending strike , impersonally , almost like a jury debating the merits of a case , though occasionally one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Best stick with the strikers , " said a man from the boilermaker group . " You go on workin , you 're a scab , an en when it 's over an yo ole white boss come back , maybe he make trouble fo you . " " Yeah , but if you quits , who gon thank you ? " asked Bucky Miller . " I 'm gon quit when they does , " said a blacksmith , " an get me  | another job . Wo n't be no work here noway , till they get some scabs in . " " Hell , man , we 's the scabs , ai n't we ? " The air of tension infected everyone , like an odd disease , so that George , if he passed through town at night , often met men clustered at street corners or emerging from a dim stairway in a heated discussion . Though pitched low , the vibration of their voices , heavy with indignation , alarmed him and sent him hurrying past to escape their sight . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked about it with Tobe , but never reached any satisfactory conclusion . At times , when they had recent newspapers that Silas gave them or that Annie brought from Mrs. Murchison to line the laundry basket , he would laboriously read to Tobe the accounts of the situation while May and Annie sat by the fire playing with the baby . The papers , after reviewing the past developments and current conditions , which George and Tobe agreed they could n't understand , in general favored the workers . " Here 's another one , " said George , folding the sheet and leaning over it . " George , " sighed Annie , " you nigh bout put me to sleep readin all that stuff . Why n't you stop ? " " It 's about his job , Miss Annie , " said May . " Fiddlesticks ! " " It 's the only way we can find out anything , ai n't it ? " May went on . " Who 's gon na explain any of it to us ? " " This one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big words I don know . " " Read it anyway , " said Tobe . " Politicians of a certain stripe , financial and professional men with ulterior motives and short-sighted business men are banded together to " bait " the railroads , and will continue to do so until the influence of employees is exerted in behalf of their employers . These persons as well as the employees know that the charges against the railroads are false and an unwarranted attack on the intelligence and manhood of the railroad employees . Their arguments are the wolf-cry intended to divert , while the railroads are being mistreated and their shareholders plundered . The employees themselves can , and will , we believe , help . The apathy of some and the adverse sentiments of a few should be corrected  | by such employees as are naturally leaders . The employee must realize that an attack upon his employer is an attack upon himself . ' " The workers , however , did not seem to feel the way their ernployers wanted them to , and the situation slowly developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting , George gathered , for a signal from somewhere . Late in that winter , George 's second son was born . May suffered no unusual difficulties this time , but had her hands full now with two babies . Realizing this , Annie came over to nurse the children whenever she could , although she knew Miss Lucy was there to lend a hand . But to Annie 's way of thinking , Miss Lucy had forgotten a great deal about tending to babies , for when Henry Daniel 's first tooth began to push through and he cried inexplicably , she had done no more than tie a spoonful of sugar in a clean rag and give it to the child to suck . " A sugar-tit , " cried Annie , " ai n't gon na help . I got somethin 'll cyore the pain . " The next day she brought a little box and , raising the lid cautiously , drew out of it a live field mouse . Ignoring May 's questions , she plucked a white-threaded needle from her dress and aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May and Miss Lucy screamed when the needle pierced both eyes and pulled the thread through . Quickly Annie hung the mouse , wriggling in convulsions , around the child 's neck . May tried to brush the animal away , but Annie held her back . " Do n't you touch it till it 's dead . It 's drawin out all the soreness . " " Oh Annie , " breathed Miss Lucy . " Tha 's awful . " " People don do that any more , Miss Annie , " said May . " It don do no good . It 's makin me sick . " " You jus think folks don do it . They don let you see em , tha 's all . " May went into the other room and tried to wipe the image from her mind . When she told George about it that night , he only laughed and said it was nothing . " Looks like it worked , he ai n't cryin no mo . " " He 's wo ' to a frazzle by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's gon na cure a pain . " " There 's all kinds o medicine . " All of Annie 's attentions to the two children were n't quite so disturbing to May , though some of the amusements she offered  | them did n't produce exactly the desired results . When Annie bent over him , pretending to scare him , reciting all in one breath and going faster and louder , " What-y ole-y woman come-y here twelve-y clock-y night-y , bring-y Black-y back-y , all-y head-y go to blood BOO ! " the child would be delighted . But when , the following spring , she rustled a bunch of daffodils in his face , he fought them off and whimpered . " Now jus listen to that  --  tunin up to cry , " Annie sighed . Both children had whooping cough in the early summer , but they were light cases ; and in August Henry Daniel got the measles . May was exhausted with trying to keep him in bed and guarding against Annie 's remedies . " Sheep-saffron tea ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made o jus little ole sheep pills , May , " Annie protested . But May continued to rely on whatever doses Doctor Tom would prescribe for the boys . By fall , when the strike began , the children were in good health but , according to Annie , puny and peaked , and Henry Daniel had begun to babble strings of sound and often words . When George reached the shops that September morning , a foreman was saying to a group of men : " They walked out in Memphis yesterday . I hear they 're goin to call for a general strike . " A few days later the car men and boilermakers did n't come to work and the Negro helpers struck with them . They heard of walkouts in the shops all up and down the main line , though none of the trainmen were involved . Machinists , blacksmiths , molders , and painters went out next , and the shops were virtually shut down . Except for crossing town to confer with Tobe , George stayed close at home , listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Lucy against going downtown for any reason , he had to run the necessary errands to the grocery store . For in the first few days of the strike he had seen enough to know it was best to keep out of the business and railroad districts . A trainload of strikebreakers arrived from Chicago and began work with the dozen men left in the shops . Certain of their jobs and salary , they could n't be certain of much more . A new face on the streets , at a door , meant a scab , and few people would rent them rooms . One evening George saw them leaving the yards for their boarding houses , each scab escorted by several strikers , silent and pointing fingers the whole way . A few  | days later a crowd attacked a passing train of strikebreakers with brickbats . Each morning the streets were thronged with angry idle citizens waiting for the scab trains to come through , and they put up a sign at the depot saying : " It ai n't healthy for scabs in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth among the crowds , tried to get the men to disperse , but it was useless . Many of them began to carry guns openly , then several shots were fired through a train and that night , in a long volley of shooting , a man was killed . The sheriff wired for the militia and the railroad company moved all its strikebreakers into the shops area , housing them in brick sheds , warehouses and the roundhouse . After a second riot with ten or so wounded occurred , a ten-foot fence was erected around the railroad yards so that when the militia arrived the men encamped in tents pitched along the stockade . But already nearly a hundred scabs had packed up and to the hoots of the strikers boarded a north-bound train . With armed guards on all the trains now and around the shops , and a visit of investigation from Governor Noel impending , the vexation of the strikers subsided and as the weeks went by seemed to turn upon themselves . So far there had been no positive gain and the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike on . In this deadlock , the white union men , with their charge accounts closed in local stores , lived on their savings and low strike benefits , while the Negro helpers wondered what they would live on tomorrow . " I cai n't stay out any longer , " George told Tobe . " It ai n't helpin me nohow . I 'll have to scab . " " You 're right , the ' ai n't much choice , " agreed Tobe . " If you wait an wait , maybe there wo n't be any job at all fo you . These men scabbin now will have em , an ai n't no union goin to talk up fo you . Good many already gone back . " " If things quiet down a little mo , I 'm goin back too . I got to have the money . They fixed it so we have to be scabs one way or another . " By late November the violent phases of the strike were over . The militia had left , the stockade was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on street corners and even wearily ignored two agitators who appeared briefly in town and  | tried to whip up their enthusiasm . The strikers seemed subdued in wonder at who had led them into this mess and who was doing anything about it . Like most of the other Negro helpers , George , a bit shamefaced before an outsider 's gaze but scornfully convinced , inside , of his rightness , returned to his job ; and though he was never at ease going to work or coming back , nothing happened more serious than the minor incidents indicative of mounting or , as now , waning disturbance . Little boys sheltered behind lawn fences or hidden in shrubs would jeer at him , " Nigger scab ! " in thin voices . For lack of engines in repair to move it , a carload of pigs was backed on a siding , and the squeals , half of them dying , from thirst and cold cut through a day and a night . A group of men on the street at dusk would stare suspiciously and George was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a long route home through the outskirts to avoid the business section . For another year the stalemate continued . Hopes for success , even for a general strike involving every railroad , had given way to despair . By the following autumn , some of the strikers wanted to return to their jobs , but their proposal aroused fresh uncertainties , dissension and distrust in the local . The railroad company 's agents , whose purpose was to persuade them to go back to work , had obviously achieved something . There was a great deal of talk , obscurely suggestive , about traitors to the union and stool pigeons for the railroads . The momentum of the strike had dwindled into petty personal resentments and bickerings , with tedium , worry and a sense of confused direction aggravating the disgust of the men , when a husky , bushy-haired young man named Lennox appeared in town . George first heard of him from Bucky Miller . Lennox , as well as Bucky could understand , was organizing the colored workers and urging them to quit again and join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union ? " asked George . " He ai n't got nothin to do with the union , far as I can see . It 's some kind of outfit that wants to do good , he says . They help workin people an us niggers an he say we all got to pull together . You ought a hear im talk . " " It ai n't gon help me to quit my job . " " He say it 's in the long run where it counts . He can ' xplain it  | better'n I can , an you 'll see what e means too . It 's all to advance the cause o the worker an world freedom , an make ev'ybody good an friendly like he is . " " Is a ? " " Course e is . I ai n't never been treated that way by no other white man . " " I don understand it . ' What does it get you ? Or him ? " " It 's what he believes in , like a preacher . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then understand . The man did give the impression of a preacher , someone with a mission , and swept George along in a flow of speech whose fervor moved him even when the meaning of the big words eluded him . On his entrance , Miss Lucy , without too much show of haste , left her rocker by the fireplace and , summoning May , went to her room . But May did n't follow her . Lennox shook hands with George , said , " And this is Mrs. Murchison ? " extending his hand to May , and apologized for coming without an invitation . With a slight queasiness , the combination of anxiety about the strike and this unaccustomed conduct in a white man , George asked him to sit down . Lennox took off his overcoat and before George hung it on the door , extracted a pint bottle from the pocket . " I do n't know whether you care for whiskey , " he said , " but I took the liberty of bringing some , even if it is against the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored population . Anyhow , I think it 's easier to get to the point , to really open up to one another , if you have a nip . " While George brought in the glasses and a jug of water , Lennox complimented the children , Andrew drowsily closing his eyes as May rocked him and Henry Daniel tottering about from bureau to chairs and interrupting the talk with his cries . May smiled and thanked Mr. Lennox , and when he poured the drinks and offered the first one to her , she said shyly , " I don know as I should . I 'm not used to liquor . What do you think , George ? " " In honor of our meeting , " urged Lennox , putting the glass in her free hand . " One wo n't hurt you , " said George . Lennox raised his glass and gave a nod to each of them . " To the union of mankind and the awakening of the working peoples . "  | As they lowered the glasses from their lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " " Oh no , not the way you mean . Everyone can belong to the union of mankind , but you have to act , with positive measures , to prove your membership . My work here is that sort of action , to break the path on which all the downtrodden can march forward in their historic mission to demolish capitalism . And to do that , I must awaken others to positive action too , to a comprehension of the need for action against injustice  --  united action , the rising of all the workers of the world , arm in arm , marching against the evils of a cynical and degenerate society whose only strength is the wage system . Our strength will be faith and action  --  faith in each other and in truth , faith that can not be destroyed by prison , death or bribery ; and action that will relentlessly oppose economic oppression and social inequities . " He drank some of the whiskey and watched them to see their reactions . May , who , entranced by his speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Lennox smiled at her and nodded his head thoughtfully . " That kind of faith is latent in you , Mr. Murchison , " he continued , " and in you , Mrs. Murchison . I can see it shining in your eyes , waiting to be summoned forth . But faith , without action , will accomplish nothing . You do n't make use of your constitutional rights and as a result , you injure not just yourselves , but thousands of others . If all of you join together in common cause , in revolutionary socialism , you could move the world . Do n't you agree , Mr. Murchison ? Mrs. Murchison ? " He turned from George to May , but they sat silent and baffled . " I don quite see what you want us to do , " said George at last . " Well , " said Lennox , " I could n't hope to make it clear all at once . It 's a titanic struggle . I merely wanted to sketch the general outlines , and I 'll come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at May ? " and go into some of the details . Right now , the main thing is for all the colored railroad toilers to join the strike . That will at once initiate in you the sense of united action , and prepare you for the broader steps in the program . " " Only thing is , " said George , becoming more relaxed by now , " the white men might think we ' as tryin to join the ' union , or was puttin on airs. "  | " They should welcome such a token of brotherhood with open arms , " said Lennox . " Another drink ? " " I don think most of em feel as brotherly as you do , Mr. Lennox . " " Even if they do n't , " replied Lennox , " you yourself will feel the satisfaction of taking part , even to the point of sacrifice , in helping another group of wronged humans . It binds you up in a common faith and a common progress . It means a nobler life for man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more they might have  --  advantages and privileges you 've been denied . And you can begin working toward it , taking your first steps , just like that fine son of yours , if you join with us . " As he gestured toward Henry Daniel , Mr. Lennox had risen , made a half-turn about the room and spied the shelf of books by the mantel . " I see you have some books here . " He peered at the titles , and then sniffed . " Yes , the usual novels  --  poisons to the mind . Anyway , you can read " ? he hurried to his overcoat and fumbled in it ? " so here 's a few pamphlets that will set you right . " He laid them on the table and as he slid into the overcoat , waved away the bottle that George held out . " Not enough to bother with . You keep it . " He lowered his voice : " You understand I have to hide the reasons for my presence in town and must work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch this way , visiting at night , until we can shape up a scheme for action . Now think over what I 've said , Mr. Murchison . I can tell you 're a man of intelligence and will see the point . " After he had gone , May asked , " Well , what did he say ? " " I don rightly know , " answered George . " It made me feel so funny , jus him bein here like that an drinkin with us . " Miss Lucy emerged from her retreat , fists on hips , and surveyed them with disgust . " Well I never in all my born days ! Settin here drinkin whiskey with a white man jus as calm as you please ! " " But Miss Lucy , " began George , amused as he recalled Mr. Theo . " He was real nice , Ma , " said May . " He did n't act like other white folks . " " Yeah , it makes you see what they could be like if they tried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They all the same sooner or later . They never treat you right . " " He said George was intelligent , " said May .  | " He wants to help us  --  all the colored people , " said George . " You ai n't ' telligent enough to stay way from im , I reckon . I 'm shamed o you both . White folks no good fo colored folks  --  not when they get chummy . " George exchanged a glance with May , and they smiled tolerantly , as if understanding her mother 's contradictory position , and winked as if agreeing that Mr. Lennox had won their approval and trust . During the next two months , Mr. Lennox called on them at Ieast once a week , sometimes twice , and though Miss Lucy stormed about it , they only laughed and resisted arguing with her . When the white man sat between them , his rough , pronounced features ruddy in the light of the lamp and fire , his red-brown hair swirling up wirily and dropping in broad arcs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more as his speech and the liquor swept him into a transport , they could only respond to his enthusiasm . They began to feel quite at ease with him , rather friendly so that they could make little jokes on each other . Sometimes he played with Henry Daniel , rolling a ball to him or riding him on his foot , and sometimes he held Andrew in his lap and made silly noises to make the baby laugh . But most of the time he talked about freeing humanity from the toils of capitalism , the rising of the masses , and the overthrow of the wealthy parasitic classes . Though George began to perceive an admirable purpose in this white man , he could not always grasp the methods by which Mr. Lennox meant to accomplish his purpose ; but Mr. Lennox assured him that it was all worked out in a master plan , so vast and complex that few people could comprehend the interlocking details . As proof of some of the smaller achievements , however , Mr. Lennox mentioned the recently built schools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " show what our organization can bring you right now , so your children can be educated and take their places in this struggle . And you 'll see other evidence before long  --  the rise in your wages , which you delay now by refusing to revolt and go on strike . In the future will come your full participation in life . You 'll no longer be slaves , servants , scorned and persecuted by the whites ; you 'll no longer grovel and whimper like a beaten mongrel at their least whim . You 'll have your just dues , the share in the company profits that  | should be yours , the respect and honor that should be , and must be , yours . You 'll belong to a great world-wide union , and to clubs with white people , you 'll vote and live in fine houses and go to theatres , you 'll have senators , governors , even presidents from your race . But to gain this , you must join with us in our battle for happiness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the descriptions ; he pictured his two sons as great men and fathers of great men to come , all because of this one man , Mr. Lennox , and his organization . At last convinced of his inclination , even his duty , to strive for this goal , if not of his clarity about the means of gaining it , he asked one night , " The other men  --  they ready to join up an strike ? " " I think so , " answered Mr. Lennox , " but they ca n't understand the program and the future achievements as you can . You could influence them more than I. Do n't you think so , Mrs. Murchi-son ? " " Oh yes , I do . George could do a lot , " said May , her honest conviction made warmer by the glass of whiskey she had drunk . " But there 's nothing to hold us together , " objected George . " Some would go out , some would n't . If you could be our leader , Mr. Lennox , maybe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Lennox said hastily . " I must keep in the background where I have more efficiency . But if you want to unite and have your own club , you can join our organization . That way , you 'll be completely knitted in the great work ahead . Why not ? " " I 'll ask em . " " Good . I 'll be back in a couple of days to see what they say . I know they 'll be for it . " Mr. Lennox shook George 's hand at the door , patted May on the shoulder and went quietly down the steps . " When you think about what he says could happen , " said May dreamily , as she stood on the porch gazing at the retreating figure , " I sort o wish I could be part of it too  --  workin to get all those things fo our people . " " I still do n't see how it 's goin to work , " replied George . " He said a lot of it was secret , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole program , like faith in God , before you could begin to help or see what was goin on . "  | " I 'm willin to give it a chance . I 'll strike if the resell go out with me . " He drew May inside the threshold and closed the door . " Mr. Lennox forgot is coat . " " Oh well , it 's real springlike these days , " said May . " He 'll get it when e comes back . " The next day George presented the strike proposal to Bucky Miller and a few fellow-workers . " You gon lead a strike ? " they asked incredulously . After he told them more of what had been said by Mr. Lennox , they expressed surprise that the white nun had come to see him so often . " Jus came to see us twice , " said Bucky . " Me too , " another chimed in . " Look like he done chose you to be the head man . " " He must be primin you fo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ai n't strikin ' thout I belong to a union . " " We can join his organization , " answered George . " He 'll help us get a charter . It don cost much . " But most of the men were still hesitant , and some even doubted Mr. Lennox 's good faith . So George decided , in spite of the organizer 's warning , to find out what Silas James would say . On Sunday afternoon he accompanied Miss Lucy to Possum Hollow on her visit to Annie . May refused to go , because it was clouding up and she did n't want the children to be out in the damp air and rain . At Annie 's house , Miss Lucy stopped off and George promised to join her later on his way back from Silas . George assumed that , since Silas was a teacher , the best cautious approach to his topic would be to mention the two new schoolhouses . Silas knew of them and said it was only the beginning of the project . " You know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How they tie up with the strike an us gettin to vote an have fine homes an jobs ? " Silas laughed . " You been talkin to Mr. Lennox , " he said , and added , to soothe George 's alarm , " Oh , do n't worry . All the niggers know about him . Just pay him no mind . " " But he said these schools was part ? " " These schools , " interrupted Silas acidly , " are built by the Rosenwald Fund and do n't have any connection with Mr. Lennox or anything he belongs to . He 's lying all over the place . " " But he wants us to have the full blessins o life  --  money an respect an votes an lots o fun ? "  | " Ha ha ! " said Silas . They both turned vexedly toward the windows as a gray rain started to fall , rattling on the shingles . " We had votes , not more than twenty-odd years ago , and we 'll get votes again , some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fact is , I went down to vote last election . " " You did ? Did n't they ? ? " Silas nodded , with a wry smile on his lips . " They did . Kept me from voting , that is . But they did n't hurt me . I better build a fire  --  rain makes it chilly in here . " He knelt on the hearth and piled paper and wood into the grate . The rain beat heavier on the roof . " What 'd you do it fo ? " asked George . " I wanted to see what would happen  --  to them and to me . I felt a little gladder one way and a little sadder another . I better not try any more  --  not in this town . " " How did they stop you ? " " Well , for one thing , there was a shotgun , lying on the table . " Silas struck a match to the papers and sat back , obviously enjoying the flames . " And then there was a little game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , they got it fixed so you ca n't vote , all right . But I 'm glad I tried . " " An you think Mr. Lennox 's outfit ai n't goin to help change that so we can ? " " I think his outfit 's a phony . You stay way from him and tell him to stay way from you . You 'll get in trouble . " " I don see how . " " There 's a lot you do n't see , and lots you do n't see through . The law 's already been around asking colored folks about him and what he 's been saying . He wo n't be here long . " The downpour continued , beating with large drops like a midsummer rain . The two men talked desultorily now , George disturbed by Silas ' ruining his dream , and Silas trying to explain how , if ever , improvement would come . " From inside , " Silas repeated , " from everybody 's hearts . Then it 'll stay . If it 's not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks get at a camp meeting . Soon as the preacher 's gone , the religion goes too , because it 's not inside the people . " George stirred unhappily , but offered no arguments . Much  | later , as Silas poked up the embers , he said , " It 's gettin dark . I better get Miss Lucy an go on home , rain or no rain . " " It 's let up some now , " said Silas . " I do n't guess you 'll get too wet . " The rain had diminished to a falling mist by the time George and Miss Lucy reached Rosson Row . They were glad to see the fire going and sat before it , with their shoes off , to dry their feet . May was rocking little Andrew , who cried sulkily as if in a prolonged disappointment , and Henry Daniel was pulling a cigarbox wagon , with spool wheels , in a circle around his feet . When George dispiritedly reported Silas ' opinion of the white organizer , May raised her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did n't comment . George knew she relied , just as deeply as himself , on the promise of that better world Mr. Lennox had described , and she would be equally puzzled at the reasons for rejecting it . " Been tellin you that all the time , " said Miss Lucy . " Silas said the police was after im . " " Good riddance , " snapped Miss Lucy . " What fo ? " asked May with a flash of alarm . " Incitin the niggers , or whatever they call it . " " I guess tha 's what e meant then , " murmured May . " Meant when ? " " He come fo is coat this afternoon , " said May , cuddling the baby and arranging the covers , " jus when the rain started . He said it might be some time befo he could come back . Said e had to make a trip to headquarters . " Miss Lucy snorted and cackled . " He 'd a better said po-lice headquarters . " " I guess things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You reckon e was a phony , May ? " " I don know , George . It all sounded so good when e said it . It sounded jus like what ought a be . But maybe it was jus talk . Maybe we 're better off with irn gone . " " Now you gettin some sense , " said Miss Lucy . " Person 'd think you two ' as twins , with the gumption o one brain divided betwixt you . " For a long time , George sat silent . " I cai n't help thinkin , " he said at last , " bout all that was s'posed to happen , an what it 'd be like if it did . It ' as like a fairy tale that ' as gon na come true . "  | 24 In his heart George suffered at saying to May the things he said , but suffering more from what she had done , he could only hope to deaden one hurt by another . Now after all those months , his anguish had lost its keenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , and slowly turned into a contempt that all her gentle pleading and unobtrusive kindness could n't soften . He took an unctuous delight in taunting her , in serenely , self-righteously insulting her , with minute allusions which he would follow with a laugh . If she ignored them , he was angry and sullen ; if she protested , softly and restraining the tears he wanted to see , the way he remembered them that bygone day near the pasture , he grew furious and his brain flamed with unreasonable accusations . He should have realized the truth long before , certainly in the months after Mr. Lennox vanished forever , and not have had to wait till the proof was before his eyes . As time passed , May had acted more strange , sometimes gazing disconsolately at nothing and wearing a sad look . She fidgeted , and her hands shook pouring coffee ; she lost patience with the two children , she began sentences and never finished them . ' When he mentioned it to Miss Lucy , she merely shrugged and said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you out o sorts , you know . She ai n't ' xactly strong as a heifer , like some nigger gals . " After that he tried to be kinder to her . It was true , of course , that he had been so engrossed with Mr. Lennox 's ideas and later with the disappointment of his hopes that he had given little attention or affection to May . She had shared his concern , he knew , and she must be also disturbed at the sudden collapse of their plans . When he came home in the late summer evenings and had washed up , he would sit on the porch with May and play with the children . Once , thinking of his third child about to be born , he put his arms around her and asked if he could name it for himself , in case it was a boy . May agreed in a barely audible voice , and he was perplexed when she began to cry .  | He had sat by the fire the night the baby was born and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to May . Andrew fell asleep and he spread him under quilts on the sofa and propped two chairs at the edge to keep him from rolling off . When May screamed , Henry Daniel asked , wide-eyed , " What 's a matter wi ' Ma ? " " She 's callin the stork to bring er a little baby , " said George . " Do n't you want another little brother ? " As Henry Daniel stared undecidedly , George said , " Like Andrew ? " and the child nodded shyly . When Aunt Martha at last told him , " You got another boy baby , George , " he did n't remember till two days afterward that she had smiled in a pinched way and her eyes had looked worried . In the dim light of their bedroom , he peeped at the baby , dull pink like the others had been at birth , and patted May 's hair and said , " Then it is George . " She closed her eyes and murmured , " If you want it that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rest . He should have known , too , from the women 's faces that they sensed something he did n't notice . He should have guessed from May 's apathetic manner when , the next night , after washing off the coal soot , he fondled the baby and talked happily against her gloom , which he interpreted as merely weariness . Except that he saw little George only by lamplight , he should have perceived much sooner that his new son , now that the prenatal pink had sunk into a natural tint , had skin almost the color of honey . It was lighter than that of the two older boys , lighter even than May 's skin , and when he first saw the difference he turned away after a moment 's disbelief and stood looking out the window . The doubt that struck him , and the conflict to deny it , must have shown in his features , for May asked what was the matter . At first he did n't answer or move ; but then he faced her and with difficulty said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm protectively about the form at her bosom and with her eyes imploring him , nodded . " It ai n't natural  --  him to be that light , " George said , while the terror which her expression , linking with so many other similar ones , created , pounded in him . " How come ? " On the heels of the terror , as he saw that it could n't hinder or change what would be revealed now , came a vast sorrow . " I been wantin to tell you , " May was saying , " an now I got  | to . I was too scared befo . I kept hopin somethin 'd happen to make it all right . Like it would n't happen at all . I been crazy cause I could n't tell you . George ... " But he was gone out of the room and out the front door . After stumbling in the December night to the bottom of the Row , too dazed to have any conception of his actions or thoughts , he sank down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shiver and to remember : the pasture was just beyond , and one day May had sat here weeping because he had said : " You 'll have a sweet time tryin to be better'n yo pa was . You got a pa cai n't even speak to you on the street . . . " He wanted to cry too , now , but he could n't ; he squeezed up his arms and lowered his head and pinched his chest together , but when the sound came out it was only a whining moan , jerky and weak , like the bleat from a toy animal . To do this to me , he thought ; and was it for revenge ? May , why did you do it ? But you expect it of mixed blood , do n't you ? They always cater to whites . But why choose Mr. Lennox  --  he was n't being better than us ; he was trying to help us and be friends . For it must have been him . But when ? He learned that , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to May . Neither Aunt Martha nor his mother nor Tobe seemed to feel that May had low-rated them all before the town . Nobody but us knows for true , they argued ; it happened lots of times and could n't always be prevented . After all , was he such a saint himself ? At length they persuaded him to hear May 's story , and he went into the bedroom and sat near the bed , but sideways so that he would n't see her face on the pillows . " They say it ai n't yo fault , " he began . " I 'm ready to listen . " There was no immediate answer . He could tell she was looking at him , perhaps with eyes red from crying , but he kept his gaze fixed steadfastly on the wall . When after a while she began to speak , it was as if she had taken all that time to gather the strength for her words . He almost turned to her , but caught himself and held rigid . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came here fo is overcoat an set an talked . He gave me a drink an en another . He put is arm around me but e was still talkin bout the program fo the union o mankind , an I did n't dare stop im . " " Why not ? Do n't you know enough about white men ? " " I thought e meant everything fo our good . You thought so  | too , George . If e 'd been jus any white man , I could a made im stop easy , or yelled or somethin . But it was n't like that with him . I 'd got to trust im , like you , an thought e had ideas not like other white men . Then e grabbed me an started kissin . I was a little drunk an could n't think good . I did n't want a get im in trouble , I guess . " " So you kissed im back . " " At first , George , " she said shyly . " I thought e was jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " An you liked im , " said George coldly . May faltered and reached toward him . He drew back abruptly so that his chair scraped on the floor . " I could n't stop im ? I did n't know how , " May said . " I cai n't explain it all , George . I did n't want it to happen . " " You liked im , " George repeated , contemptuously this time . " You wanted im to . You prob'ly planned for im to leave is coat . " " No , I did n't . Please , George  --  I don know now what it was . But I could n't stop it . I could n't think . I could n't do nothin . I been crazy ever since . " " Crazy cause e left you , I guess . I guess you been puttin out to lots o others while I been workin . I guess you did it lots o times with im , behin my back . How many times was it ? How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancied enormity of her faults as he dragged them from the possibilities furnished by his imagination . But knowing they must n't all be possible , he was furious that even one was , and that it was a fact . His outburst was suddenly choked by his inner shame . " There was n't any , " said May quietly . " There was jus that one time . It 's been weighin on me to tell you , but I could n't face it . I hoped there would n't be a baby . But there is , an it cai n't be helped now . An I done confessed it all to you . I could n't a gone on without that . " She waited for some response but George did n't move . " Jus say it 's all right , George , an we can go long like we used to . I been through too much . I always loved you ? you know that . " " An I been lovin a two-timin slut . " " No  --  no ? " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face to hide the tears . But she offered no further denial or plea . Her suffering , her feeble excuses , infuriated George , and he  | called her all the abusive names that came to his mind . But doing so did n't ease his torment and after a week he stopped , for he realized it bruised himself as well as her . But during the first days after his discovery , he could hardly force himself to go to work , fearing that everyone knew and would laugh at him . He was so preoccupied with wounded pride that he was unable to concentrate on the job and at length complained of illness and laid off for a few days . Still he pretended to go to work in order to escape from the house ; and he spent each day walking the streets , stopping when lie got too cold in Jim Lemon 's cafe for coffee , or sitting in the colored waiting room of the depot . He did n't want to see anyone who knew him well . Sometimes he attended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzard 's roost , the tiny balcony for Negroes , and watched Charlie Chaplin and cowboys and bathing girls and ladies tied to railroad tracks or kegs of dynamite . While he was there , he seemed to forget , but when the lights came on and the audience rose chattering , clattering the folding chairs and crunching the peanut hulls , he knew he must go home and see May lying in the bed and the pale child in the bassinet at her side , to remind him of all that had been ruined . Everyone had gone on calling the new baby by his name , much to George 's annoyance and in spite of his objections , and sometimes he would grumble , " Better name fo that brat 'd be Uniono-Mankind . " Or , " Why n't you call im Lennox after is pa ? " May took no apparent notice of the remarks , and he often scrutinized her features , secretly he hoped , to see if she had n't felt hurt . The older women on both sides of the family were indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some excuse for his nagging insults . " He jus torment er so , " Aunt Martha had reported to Annie , " he done dried up all er milk , an the po chile got a be bottle fed . " " I would n't a thought a chile o mine could act so mean , " said Annie . " Where do e get it ? " " It do n't all come from meanness , " said Aunt Martha . " Some of it come from you , Annie . " " From me ? What make you say a thing like that ? " " Well , you the one put it in im to be so persnickety bout is  | family an the respect o the town . Tha 's hurtin too , long with all the rest . He got part you an part Henry in im . " " Well , I cai n't say as I reco'nize either part , the way he 's actin . It 's a downright cryin shame an I 'm gon give im a talkin-to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He admitted he felt ashamed when he spoke to May as he did , but he could n't explain it or control it . " It jus crawl aroun in me all the time , " he told her . " An any time I see er , it comes out . It jus jumps out , Ma , like I did n't even know it was goin to . I don know how to stop it . An en I feel so bad cause I done it , I start thinkin some mo an en that jumps out . An when I look at the baby , I jus  --  I don know what I 'm thinkin . I jus want a kill it . " Each night he continued to flee the house , to avoid May 's beseeching eyes and the sight of the baby , colored with his disgrace , and the resentful disappointment evident in Miss Lucy 's every gesture and word . He thought many times of leaving town altogether , going to join Columbus in the Delta and work with him at tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the conflict of his injured love and the fumbling kindness that tried to rise from it . One evening , as they were finishing their silent supper , a man knocked at the door and asked if he might talk to them . When he entered , carrying a brief case , they saw he had a heavy build , and dark skin that emphasized the gray frizz around his head when he took off his hat . Unbuttoning his light overcoat , he revealed a broad red ribbon cutting diagonally across his chest , with a large golden sunburst pinned at the center . " I am Prince Azrael , " he announced while they stared in amazement , " Minister of the Rising Sun of the Lost and Wandering Tribes , and Lord of the Sons of the Ethiopian Kingdom . " At the sound of his voice , precise and hard , recalling to his hearers the accent of Mr. Lennox , Miss Lucy directed a suspicious glance at May . " An what a you want a talk about ? " she asked peremptorily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the task of regaining our stolen birthright . We are the sons and daughters of kings and princes of Ethiopia and we have been deprived of everything , even our true race , to please the whims of white men . We are not Negroes as they call us , but Ethiopians ,  | and we must all work together to restore our true status in the world . We must rise up against the whites in our true dignity and overthrow their rule of slavery . " " You talkin out o yo hat , Mr. Prince , " said Miss Lucy scornfully , and went out with a stack of supper dishes . " You say that because you 're intimidated by them , " the Prince called after her . " But once you begin to feel your true self , " he bent solicitously toward George and May , " your nature as noble Ethiopian instead of nigger slave , you 'll think different . We must work for the honor of our race and preserve it from insult and degradation . " " Tha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm with you all the way , Prince . " The gray-haired man beamed . " Ah ! Then I can enroll you right now in our Kingdom and remove the stigma of Negro from you and restore your natural heritage of Ethiopian . " He took up the brief case and reached inside among the sheaf of papers . " Don be a goose , George , " said Miss Lucy , re-entering to take her seat by the hearth . " This is gon na cost money . " " The charges are very small , dear lady , " murmured Prince Azrael . " You done got bit once by one o these organizin men , " Miss Lucy went on stubbornly , and then suddenly made a movement of obliteration . " That was a white man , " said George , with a bitter grin at her mistake in mentioning it . The Prince was ignoring their comments . " You will receive a scroll of membership like this " ? he unrolled a large gaudy sheet ? " with your name inscribed in gold letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he stroked the huge pin on his breast ? " which you can wear to identify yourself to other members of your race . This one , of course , is solid gold and came down to me through the centuries from my ancestors , Emperor Agal-ami and King Pogol-ami , with the Book of the Race which I have had printed . You 'll receive a copy gratis . Now , what are the names ? " George gave his name and drew some money from his pocket , while the Prince wrote in a small black book . " Your wife ? " asked the Prince eagerly , with pencil poised . " Your mother and three children ? " with a nod toward the bassinet.  | " Jus me , nobody else , " said George glumly , as he handed the bills to the Prince . " Yeah , jus you is right , " said Miss Lucy . " But surely all the family ? " the Prince protested . " You said it was the honor o the race , did n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad blood or whatever you called it . " Miss Lucy stiffened and her rocking chair stopped . " ' Pears to me , if you an this gentleman want a do business , you better do it somewheres else . " " I do n't understand , " stammered the Prince . " If you do n't wish to ? " " They ai n't got the right , they ai n't pure race , " said George . He gasped to a stop and then helplessly was driven on . " Least of all , her . " Miss Lucy called his name sharply . Prince Azrael peered at the two women as if in surprise that he had n't noticed their light skin , and then said , " We can always make allowances . Now when through some accident ? " " This ai n't no accident , " said George angrily . " It 's all damn well planned . If it 's gon na be pure , I want it pure . No damn white blood . Jus look in that cradle . Look ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung to her feet and marched between them . The sweeping of her skirts against the Prince , as much as the heat of George 's statements , could have suggested that the Prince had better go . He pushed back his chair , hastily gathered his papers and rose . " Tha 's enough out o you , George , " Miss Lucy was saying . " I 'll beat the livin daylights out o you , even if I am a lady . " She turned on the gray-haired man . " An enough out o you , too . Now git ! " The Prince hurried out , promising on his way to the door to send George 's certificate soon . As the door slammed behind him , Miss Lucy stood looking at George , hunched over , with his face in his hands , and said , " Bringin it up befo strangers ! You 're worse'n any white man I ever knowed of . " Then she moved past him to the hearth , and after stirring the fire sat in her rocker and gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had colored her words changed into a wistful sadness . " You make  | it mighty hard fo us , George . You tannin yo'self crazy , or you would n't do this way . " At times , from the insistent sense of injury and desolation that filled him , George thought he really must be going crazy as Miss Lucy said . All his family told him he ought to trust in May 's story that she could n't prevent it , but he could n't , and so he could n't forgive as they said he should . But outwardly he seemed to be adapting himself by degrees to a state of both toleration of May 's presence and personal antagonism toward her and little George . Except for flaunting his certificate from the Ethiopian Kingdom when it arrived , holding it close before them and bragging that he at least had pure blood and a paper to prove it , he restricted his abuse to allusions , slyly made and tinged with contempt . But they were no consolation for his sorrow ; and the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his pride . For Silas assured him that the document and the facts were false ; moreover , the police had chased the Prince out of town for fleecing the Negroes . " Everybody 's always looking for the big cure-all , " said Silas , " an there 's always somebody got one to sell . Most folks that buy are going to get stung . " George remembered his words one warm spring night as he stood at the outer edge of a crowd before a medicine-show booth . The men , silhouetted by the four flares on the small platform , shifted from leg to leg as they watched the doctor , discoursing between magic tricks , tell how he had received the recipe of his secret concoction from a dying Indian chief and how it had cured millions of people of hundreds of ailments . They pressed closer when a dancing girl came through the painted canvas backdrop and wriggled as a man played a jangly piano and the doctor cracked jokes . Then the doctor asked for a volunteer to try his tonic and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly after a dose of the medicine , the sick man had begun to grin and cock his eyes about ; the kinks left his back , he stood erect , did a little buck-and-wing and cried , " Yeow ! " As the doctor offered the bottles over the edge of the platform at a dollar each , many men pushed forward with the money raised in their hands . " Just buying a cheap drunk with a bad taste , " remarked a man in front of him .  | George had his bad taste and little excitement from the drunkenness . He was , after all , as Miss Lucy told him , just a pure nigger and no pure Ethiopian royal family about it . And Mr. Lennox had seen to it that he was united with one more white man through May  --  there had been her granpa , and Mr. Theo  --  and now there was that son , hers but not his , and bearing his name , to remind him forever of the betrayal . If he could only wipe that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of his mind May 's part in it , might almost forget . But now he could n't turn to her for comfort or encouragement ; he could n't turn to anyone , for they all disapproved of his behavior . No hope to pursue , no place to escape , no love to discover ... 25 " Well , why do you slap im , George ? He ai n't old enough to know better . " May hugged the baby to her breast and frowning at George , tried to make her voice heard above the noise of crying and the music of the gramophone . The two older boys , drawn by the screams from their game on the porch , peeped around the door and giggled . " He was pullin over the gramophone , " shouted George . " You could stop im without that . Just take is hands away . " " I cai n't stand to touch the little yellow bastard . " " Well , it ai n't his fault . Why do n't you slap me , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap you , tha 's why , " he said sullenly . " You mighty brave hittin a little baby that cai n't hardly walk . " May carried the baby into the bedroom and kicked the door shut . Above the softer passages of the music George could hear her singing to the child , and he jerked toward his head the long black horn , decorated with gilt vines and flowers . Whenever he stayed home , he played the meager collection of records incessantly , to fill the emptiness between him and May or to eliminate the need for conversation . Henry Daniel approached , with Andrew tagging behind , both  | soundless on their bare feet , and stood at his father 's knee . " Wha 'd li'l yella bastud do , Pa ? " George gave him a surprised look and broke into a roar of laughter . " What you call im that fo ? " he asked , curling an arm around the boy 's waist . " Tha 's what you call im . " " Well , tha 's is real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you call im George , cause tha 's my name . " Then his hand slid away from the boy , who still clung to his knee , and came together in his lap with the other hand and the fingers gripped , interlocked , while his smile was overclouded by a drawn look of disgust . The boy began talking , but George said , " Run on an play , now . " " You come play with us . " " No , not now . Go on . " He began to shuffle the records as if choosing another to play , and when the children had returned to the porch , he put a disc on the turntable without knowing what it was . A voice came out moaning , " Coon , coon , coon , I wish my color would fade . . . " He clicked off the motor , snatched up the record and broke it over his thigh . Quickly he replaced it with " Bugle Call of the Rough Riders in their Charge up San Juan Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that May had stopped singing and the baby was quiet . Sunday afternoons , even in the compromise with his home life that he had achieved in two years , were no longer any fun . He could n't go visiting with May , the children and Miss Lucy , for he could n't control his behavior toward them and could n't even apologize . When he went alone , Annie or Aunt Martha were likely to urge him to mend his ways ; and he would answer , " I try . If it jus was n't fo that baby . . . " He found he could talk best with Silas James , for Silas seldom made any direct criticism of his conduct . George was aware that he made suggestions and would like to discuss it frankly , but the teacher generally kept to more public topics . Silas recounted all the major news from the Chicago paper he received by mail , the biggest story being the outbreak of war in Europe and the rapid involvement of most of the continent . Later on he read to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly everyone had heard . Housewives had repeated them in horror to their servants who in turn brought them  | to their families . George took a savage delight in talking , for a change expansively , about them to May and Miss Lucy . " An when they get through with the nuns , " he would say , " they take the ' bay'nets an march through the town . " He relished so much the prospect of his effect that he began to enact the scene with a poker . " They go in all the houses an ev'ytime they see a little baby they run im through with the bay'net " ? he jabbed at the child in May 's arms and , enjoying her wince , shouldered the poker and strode about the room ? " an en they strut up an down the streets drinkin an holdin the babies on top o the ' guns . " " You ought n't to tell them things , " said Miss Lucy ; " anyway , actin like it was little George . " " They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He laughed . Holding the poker above his head , he waved at the tip , spinning it around . " Hi , li ' 1 Jawjie ! " he drawled . " You ought a be tarred an feathered , " said May . " You 're lowdown an dirty-minded . I would n't ever thought you 'd be like this . " George laughed on and on . But there was no peace for him , no escape , except with casual friends who did n't comment on his private life  --  friends in Lemon 's cafe or Cato Kendrick 's blind tiger , or McCabe 's Blue Pullet dice game ; or unknown flickery friends seen from the buzzard 's roost of the Bijou movie house . He joined the Society of Fraternal Black Brotherhood , thinking it might take the place of the discredited Ethiopian Kingdom , and hoping it would be somewhere to go when all else bored him . But he found he got bored there first of all  --  their socials were too calm and formal , their aims too seriously vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He floundered , in a depressed state , happy only when working at the shops or drinking at the blind tiger , and to relatives and friends alike presented a moody reserve they had never known in him . One Saturday night when he came home drunk and got into bed beside May , he tried to take her into his arms . Half-asleep , she moved to embrace him , and he thought he was going to cry , but then she twisted from his clasp and rolled away . He yelled , " God damn it ! " and sat up and beat his fists on the pillow . " Wha 's a matter with you ? " He knelt on the mattress and shook  | her with both hands . " Be quiet , George , " she said in an unsteady voice , " you 'll wake the baby . " After that he did n't offer to touch her , though it was impossible for either not to know , waking in the night , that one often embraced the other in sleep . Many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls so readily available in his places of entertainment . He flirted with them , mechanically , merely to give a purpose to his presence and on a few occasions when he had been drinking they exchanged caresses . But if he seriously considered going to bed with any , giving himself the excuse that he was horny and it would be turnabout for May , he would suddenly become aware that it was n't equal revenge , for May had done it with a white man . The image of Cora would often leap into his mind and he would recall how she felt about Albert , how the white man in it was what shamed him most and not the mere promiscuous acts . Would he , he sometimes wondered , have been so distressed if it had been a Negro man with May ? And then he would recall his father 's course and think he must n't bring about more destruction than was inevitable . There were his two boys , Henry Daniel , ready to start school in a couple of years , and Andrew who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurt them , he must guard for them their chances . For there was that other child , the one paler than any , pale as a lump of taffy candy , the one they called George . He must be careful that his sons could n't hold against him what they could hold against May and her near-white child . And though he wanted to run away , he must stay to protect them from that tainted blood , which might try to lord it over them and deny them their due , while giving everything to the taffy-colored boy . His resolve held until he encountered in the Society clubrooms two white men offering free tickets to the north  --  Chicago , Detroit , Cleveland  --  with a job promised at the end of the journey . George listened to the proposition and could see nothing wrong with it ; this kind of escape to a faraway land , with no uncertainties or problems , seemed very enticing . After watching several friends sign up , he could n't resist the appeal and impulsively gave them his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Lincoln was and he would n't be lonesome ; Lincoln had written one letter home about the wonderful life he led there . Then remem-  | bering he could n't stomach Lincoln 's pride in his light skin and his search for white friends , he faltered and almost withdrew his signature . But the idea of escape was stronger ; he could make his own way , he 'd have a job  --  in a meat-packing company , the men said  --  and he 'd be free . " All you who signed be here at nine tomorrow , " announced one of the white men . " We 'll have your work slips and tickets to your destination at that time . The morning train will carry a special chartered coach for you . Be some people in it from towns south of here , but you 'll have plenty of room and be comfortable . " George went direct to Silas to ask him to see that his sons started school and to write him occasionally how things were . In a fever of elation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you know what you 're doing ? " " Sure . It 's the best chance I ever had . " " And you do n't care about your family ? " " I done ask you to watch out fo Henry Danny an Andrew . " " There 's more family than that . " " They can get along without me . " " Then it 's just for spite ? You ruin your home just to spite May for one mistake . " " I cai n't stand it there . It eats on me all the time . " " You think it 's going to be all pretty up there , and full of freedom , like the Pearly Gates opening up . You 're just like the rest , and you 'll end like them  --  always running away trying to find your freedom somewhere else . You got to make your freedom where you are . " " I ai n't lookin fo what Lincoln is , " said George . Silas ' words from years ago flashed in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... It 's got to be everybody feeling free , or nobody is . " " Just the pot and the kettle , " answered Silas . " You in the same slavery most folks are  --  the slavery of hate . Except you hate your wife and her son . Why do n't you call him your son and forget the rest ? " " No . Tha 's what I cai n't ever do . Tha 's why I got a go . " " I guess you do n't know this scheme is just to get cheap labor up north  --  to control the demand for pay raises ? "  | " I don see how that 'd ao anything . " " And you do n't know they been stopping the trains that carry you up there and making trouble . " " Why would anybody care ? " " Because the southern whites want their cheap labor too , that 's why . They want those agents chased out , the colored people chased back and everything to stay put . " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With a last look at Silas ' worried face , George hurried out , angry that a restless remorse had darkened his happiness . At Annie 's shack he hesitated , but decided not to go in , since she would only add to his doubt . She would remind him of the last thing he wanted mentioned  --  how his father Henry had run away from home , no matter if for a different reason , and trouble and tragedy had come as a result . He did n't tell May till the next morning when he bundled up his clothes in a box and was ready to leave . Miss Lucy did n't say a word , and May looked a long time at him , as if to puzzle out whether he was serious or not . " I guess it 's jus as well , " she said at last , when George was kneeling with his arms around Henry Danny and Andrew . " You 're no ' count around this family now , anyway . " " An do n't you take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boys . " You jus poke im in the nose and tell im what 's what . " He kissed them good-bye and went out with no further notice of May or Miss Lucy . But on the porch he paused , pretending to adjust his hat , and listened with a sudden twinge of regret for a sound from the room . Perhaps May would call after him , and he could ignore her , or she would fall weeping on the table , and he could scoff ... but there was nothing . When he reached the depot , after receiving his ticket and papers at the Society , he noticed the sheriff and a group of deputies lingering on the cinder area by the tracks . With the other travelers , George stood in the colored waiting room , speculating on the reason for the white officers ; and when the train pulled in , all emerged nervously to look for their chartered coach . They found it guarded by the deputies , and the sheriff talking to the flagman beside the regular Jim Crow car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriff called , turning to the group . After a pause , one of them said , " We goin on a special car . " " Not on that one , " the sheriff replied and pointed to the chartered coach , from whose windows rows of anxious black faces peered out . The flagman shifted from foot to foot and stared tightly over the cluster of heads . A brakeman ducked between the cars and began to clank at the coupling . " Anybody with tickets to Tennessee towns can get on this car , " announced the sheriff . The engine , spewing steam , pulled the chartered car away from the remainder of the train . While the coach was backed on a siding , uncoupled and left there , George watched dumbfounded , despondent and angry in the alarmed silence of the group . The engine and baggage cars crossed back over the switch and joined again with the train . " You boys with special car tickets to the Nawth might as well go on back home , " said the sheriff . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men began to drift shamefully away . Hardly more than a year later  --  for George a year of depression and inertia , in which he worked as in a trance and could summon little initiative to plan another flight from home  --  he was at the depot again . But this time everything was different . This time he was on the train . Outside the window there were crowds of white and colored people all about , their voices , their faces , exhibiting a mixture of high spirits and sadness . Even the town band was there , wearing the red and gold jackets over ordinary trousers , and playing " It 's a Long Way to Tipperary . " At last he had found an escape that everyone could approve  --  war . Almost as soon as he learned of President Wilson 's announcement that the United States had declared war on Germany , and the recruiting office had opened in Ashton , he presented himself for enlistment , only to be told that all the colored organizations were filled . " When will there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " said the sergeant . " There 's only four regular outfits for niggers . You ca n't get in till they activate some more . " Every week he stopped in to inquire and soon the sergeant said , " You 're mighty anxious to get in , boy . What 's wrong with you ? " But at last the notification came through in the early win-  | ter , and George was sworn in . As before , he never discussed his idea with May and waited till the last moment to tell her , and even then he did it indirectly . Henry Danny , with his primer and tablet in a woven strap , was setting out for school when Henry caught him up in a hug . " Tell yo pa goo'bye , " he said . " I 'm goin off to fight the Huns . " May gasped his name and moved toward him . Miss Lucy set down her coffee cup . The boy kissed George 's cheek and said , " Goo'bye . See you tonight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Today , George ? " breathed May . " This mornin . " " I knew some other men were goin today , " she said dazedly , " but I never ... " " Better be movin , " he said and rushed into the bedroom . " Don have to take much  --  they give us our uniforms at camp . " Miss Lucy took another sip of coffee and her eyes turned sad . " So tha 's why e was whistlin las night , an actin so lively . Might a knowed somethin was up . Set down , May , you lookin right funny . " May dropped into her chair at the table and tried to concern herself with the food . But in a moment her arms fell on the checkered cloth . " Oh , Ma  --  he might get killed over there . An us like this  --  fo so long . " Miss Lucy went to her side and stroked her hair . " Don take on so , honey , " she murmured . " Honey  --  hol ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet articles into his pocket , George came from the bedroom . He pulled on his coat and hat and faced the two women . Some of the excitement died in him as he saw Miss Lucy 's haughty face , her figure rising staunchly beside May 's back . Her eyes did n't flinch or plead ; they stared unbelieving . He crossed to where Andrew sat eating , squatted beside him and whispered , " You go to school nex year like I done tole you , an mind what yo Uncle Silas says . " He rose to go out but could n't pass through the wall of Miss Lucy 's gaze . Somehow his pleasure was lost and his decision seemed to swell from merely an indulgent gesture to a tremendous finality which he was n't prepared to accept . " Well , Miss Lucy , " he said tentatively and softly , " I hope ? " But he did n't know what he hoped . He moved another step .  | " George ? " Miss Lucy stretched out a restraining hand toward him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may not come back to us  --  ever . You ai n't goin , an not  --  speak to May . " " She knows , " said George gruffly . " I tole er . " Miss Lucy pulled May to her feet and turned her , distrait yet wistful , toward him . " You cai n't leave things this way , George , " she said . It was a gentle question , a command , a plea . He kept on standing there , feeling a helpless penitence and angry for it , and bent his head . In a moment he saw May 's hand come out into the empty space on which he gazed and take his hand ; and he looked up into her anxious eyes . " I 'm proud o you , George , " May said , with an effort , " goin to fight fo your country . " It swept a forgotten tenderness over him that brought his hands to her shoulders . He drew her close for a second , then released her . " An him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George who was walking unsteadily toward them . George glared at the child , approaching closer , reaching out for his trouser leg , mechanically calling the word May must have taught him ? " Pa-pa ! " His body tautened , and his leg tensed . He jerked away and left the house , running until out of sight of the Row when he strangely mistook his panting for a sob and slowed down , and then walked on to the station . So now it was over and he could be peaceful again and free . He had said good-bye to Annie and Mamie  --  there they were by the post where the Red Cross canteen wagon was propped . The colored Red Cross ladies , in their long white dresses with the big symbol on the bosom and the white folds of the headdress falling over the shoulders , were passing along the coaches , offering comfort kits and cigarettes and chocolate candy . It was a nippy day , but sunny , and most of the windows were up , and the men , many already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike  --  any joke , encouragement , slogan or greeting that came to mind . From somewhere came a boisterous singing of " We 'll hang the Kaiser to a sour apple tree . " In the long string of rear coaches the white recruits were saying good-bye in vestibules and on steps , and though most of their relatives were at that end of the train , many other whites wandered along the tracks gazing at the Negro troops and sometimes kidding them .  | At the whistle of the engine , the voices rose , all of them shouting farewells , and the open windows banged shut . The brass instruments of the band flashed in the sun as the members raised them to play a brisk march . George saw his mother waving a handkerchief high over the intervening heads . Then the train lurched , and moved slowly away . A fountain of hands came up waving , and flags and handkerchiefs fluttered , and everyone cheered and yelled . The white people waved to the Negro coaches and cried , " Get Kaiser Bill ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And they all waved until the train had passed the last person , and George sank back on the dusty seat thrilled with joy . Sure , they 'd get the Kaiser and save the world for democracy , like everybody said . They 'd tar and feather him and ride him back on a fence rail and boil him in oil . That 's why he was doing this , he suddenly realized ; it was n't because he wanted to run away from May after all , though maybe that had started him . She said she was proud of him , fighting for his country , and so he knew now why he had volunteered . A little melancholy floated over him , but he thought of all the cheering , how all those people at the station had known what May knew , and were grateful to him and these other men for their sacrifice . It was the only time he ever had seen white people cheering a Negro , the only sign of respect he had ever known from them . Maybe times were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Say , buddy , how bout shootin a little craps ? "  | 26 Save the world for democracy , hell ! Save the world for shit , white man 's shit , months and months of it and even with the war over years more of it to come , to cover him deeper and deeper , smothering , choking , burning with the degradation , eating like hot lye all the more because it heaped cold apathy on his idealism , on his very humanity . " Hey , coon , come ' ere ! " from a white officer . " Boy ! Get them darkies on to diggin them trenches , " from another , though who would know he was speaking to Corporal G. Murchison ? Trenches ... . George spat off the porch on Rosson Row and stared at the fleck of sputum on the dusty strip of earth . Once in a while he would hear the clatter of a pan from the kitchen where May was cooking dinner . He heard her footsteps crossing the living room and wondered if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to him in a quick backward insight , with all the clear details that during his long months in the army camp he had pieced together to form her face in his memories . And if he found on his return that he had erred in some aspects  --  her eyebrows were n't quite so thin , her eyes more brown than black , her lips not so full  --  the error could n't change the kind nature that her image had come to represent to him . But what a surprise to see her in that hair style of puffs over the ears ? " cootie garages " they used to call them . It had been good to see her again , in spite of those puffs ; it was good now just to have her around , with all the ocean of bitterness that had filled him before the war now dried up . Even though he wrote her only a few times , short , stubborn , cold letters like a periodic report of existence , he read and reread hers and thought of her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave him all the news , of Henry Danny and Andrew in school ? not doing well , though she helped with their lessons  --  of Miss Lucy knitting socks to send overseas , of Aunt Martha and Annie and Tobe and Columbus . She wrote of the war-savings stamps they bought and joked about the concoctions she cooked for " meatless meals . " They were never love letters and never pled  | for his love or forgiveness as if , he now thought , she knew it would come . Then there were letters about the flu epidemic ? Aunt Martha was down , and Tobe and Mamie and Silas James . The Negro school was dismissed and the doctors were going from morning to night . Young Dr. Robert Murchison said he had n't slept four hours a night in a week , and was seeing everybody he could , black and white , giving out medicine and telling them to just hope . Then a letter saying the two boys and Miss Lucy had flu  --  and suddenly George had thought of the taffycolored child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him in any letter . Was he sick too ? Later May wrote that her mother had died after a week 's illness , but the boys were well . He had been astonished that tears came into his eyes  --  Miss Lucy gone ! He had remembered the last time he saw her , proud , strong , handsome , bringing May into his arms because he might not come back ; and after that letter , his final glimpse of her had haunted him  --  her arm outstretched , imperiously , pointing to little George as she said , " An him ? " With the recurring vision he had closer and closer approached an answer to the question , and the pale boy had grown more distinct , as if George had never before looked at him . He could now ; and as the boy had become more visible to him , that white organizer with the wild ideas began to fade in his memory and the upheaval the man had caused seemed slowly to attach itself to another family , to become a tale George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his feelings , he and May were transported to those early days when all was peaceful , and the sweetness he found in it was heightened by the distant touch of his chagrin . When he got off the train in Ashton , there had been no cheering crowds as when he left for war . In his uniform , with his knapsack in one hand , he had walked through a drizzling November rain toward Rosson Row . He had seen distrust and antagonism in the eyes he met along the street , eyes that said he had no right to wear a soldier 's uniform , that he was no doubt impudent , that already he was " out of his place . " In Rosson Row he had approached his home slowly , disturbed by some unaccountable problem that he wished were solved and behind him . As he stepped on the porch , the door had opened and May stood there , silently , beautiful as ever or more beautiful now after a long absence , and her gaze had spoken all he needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and their arms folded about each other . It was as if she were not someone familiar to him , but someone well-known yet fresh to his embrace . Without a word they had gone inside to the fire . In the middle of the room , the little taffy-colored boy , a toy in his hand  --  and George had hesitated . He had n't looked the same as in his vision ; maybe the vision had just grown clearer whereas the boy had grown older , he thought . After a moment , George said , " Hi , there , " still unable to call the name . The boy watched him with wide round eyes like those of an uncertain dog , then tucked his head on one side , hugged the toy to his breast and turned to go sedately into the bedroom . " He 's shy , " May had said . " Everybody calls him Taffy George now . " They had talked a long time , with frequent pauses while George wondered numbly if everything was all right , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to one of his outbursts . But he could remember no longer what those outbursts were like , only that they were horrible , inexcusable , childish . He must have said things that no one could forgive , still May had smiled at him and stroked his cheek and urged him to lie down and rest after his long trip . If he had just known how to tell her his regret , to promise he would try to make everything better ... . When he had won over little  --  yes , little George , Taffy George ; he must accept his namesake  --  and got a trustful smile , when he had talked with Silas and Annie and knew their approval , and when he had returned to his job , he would be purged and lose his insecurity . Six weeks home from the war camp , and this was all he could find to do  --  sit at the doorstep in the winter sunshine , wiggle his toes in the heavy army shoes , and wonder when he could get a job and what kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one he had to fight a white man 's war . Fight ? Trenches ? No man 's land ? He lifted the galluses briefly from his shoulders and let them snap back on the khaki-colored woolen shirt . Oh yes , trenches . . . . Yes , in South Carolina , in a field , many squads of niggers who had imagined they were soldiers , digging trenches for the white men to train in and leap from with fixed bayonets and charge across no black man 's land . And latrine trenches , too , pickaxes thudding into the hard ground , shovels  | piling the clods at the side , and filling the old stinking trench and moving the sheds . But no guns or bayonets . Just digging , spading  --  a new road needed through this forest , and so chopping and sawing and piling dirt and leveling . Or building barracks or a canteen ; the niggers could be driven over in trucks from their tents and at nightfall driven back . Better take away their ID cards , though ; they might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . " No liberty for this battalion until further notice , " the C.O. had announced . " Town ? " the lieutenant had echoed to a request . " Nothing there for you to do . Besides they do n't want you in town . " Nothing for them to do in camp either ? no real canteen , no games , maybe an occasional movie . Not even close-order drill , or manual of arms , or a rifle to take apart and clean in the evenings . George had never fired a shot at a target that he might have imagined was the Kaiser , had never jabbed a bayonet into a German dummy and twisted it as he withdrew . " You black son a bitches ! " he had heard from the guardhouse , " I 'll teach you ! " And the lesson had n't been muffled by the walls or the distance ; the whack of club on bone and flesh and the stifled cries had poured out and frozen him with bitterness . " What 'd they do ? " he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the answer . " Why not ? Ai n't nobody been off the post in more'n a month . " And why not the riot too , that came later when some of them were allowed at last to go to town to be insulted by Liberty Bond buying citizens and white soldiers ? Driven off the main streets and told to stay in niggertown , pushed about in niggertown by the MP 's , heckled and badgered and called smart-aleck if they raised their eyes and then in the end the fight . The MP 's had tried to arrest two privates for drunkenness , though they were merely from the North and talked different and had almost bumped into the MP 's as they came out of a cafe . A moment of protest , of argument , and then the club smashing a skull . The customers in the cafe had rushed out and attacked the two po licemen , black soldiers on the street joined in , and another pair of MP 's from around the corner came to restore order . The Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fired and everyone became frantic . More police had appeared to stop the insane fighting , now spreading to the neighboring white business section , windows were broken , more pistols fired at ran-  | dom , stones , bottles , bricks were flying , men and women had stumbled and fallen with shattered limbs , bleeding bodies ; and when , after two hours , order was enforced by hastily summoned armed troops , four warm corpses had lain crumpled in the streets . After the court martial , seven Negro soldiers had been executed . Save the world for this ? George was almost glad he did n't get sent to France to fight , though a soldier on the train he rode back to Mississippi late in 1919 when he was at last discharged had told him that in Europe the Negroes mostly did n't fight either . They did stevedore work , unloading ships , or repaired railroad tracks . His French girlfriend , he had said , told him the Army had sent orders to the French people to stop being nice to the Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to was the Army referrin ? " George had asked sarcastically and they both had laughed . George rose from his cramped position on the floor and stretched . He could smell meat frying and something like sweet potatoes . A little wind blew over him bearing the indefinable scent and feel of snow and he could see rising over the northern horizon a rumpled sheet of gray clouds . Another cold spell coming . Around the corner of the shack came Taffy George , pedaling strenuously to move the old squeaky tricycle over the bumpy ground . He bent over the handlebars with an intensity that frowned his brow and compressed his lips . " What cha doin , Taffy ? " asked George , in a voice that had lost its naturalness . " Playin , " said the boy disinterestedly , as he rolled past . With a sad , helpless lift to his eyebrows , George watched him vanish behind the house . When he comes around again , thought George , I 'll ask him if I can play too . But Taffy George did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard where he was probably riding in circles . " Dinner 's ready , George , " said May in the door . On Sundays when they went to visit in Possum Hollow , the two older boys walked in front , wearing black stockings , knee pants , jackets and caps , and behind them George and May with Taffy George clinging to her hand . Taffy would not walk beside  | the boys nor would he hold George 's hand . Even with the other boys away at school , he would n't look at George when they sat at meals , except to give an occasional stare which for so young a child was strangely filled with accusation and wondering hurt . It hurt George more to observe that Taffy was quite open in his friendship with Tobe . During rainy winter afternoons while they sat around the fire in Annie 's house , Taffy George would cling to the arm of Tobe 's chair , regarding him enviously and pulling close and pushing away , and would ask about trains and engines . " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him along when lie grew older . " Maybe you can get a job fixin em over , like yo pa . " Taffy George glanced coolly at George , as if to dismiss him , and put another question to Tobe . Sometimes when the general talk had died down , he would ask Tobe to tell him stories , and Tobe , who seemed to recall or make them up by the dozens , would entertain everyone with his anecdotes . Taffy George liked ghost stories best , particularly the one about the railroad ghost . " Well , I never did see it , you understand , " Tobe began , " but I 've seen where it used to be  --  down there long about Carrolton . Years ago . . . " His tone fell into a swinging , compelling narrative delivery : There was a rich family built a fine house , called " Piney Lonesome , " set off on a hill overlooking the Yalobusha River bottom land . And in the thick walls of the ballroom , the master had six cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain there till his daughter 's wedding day . She was an only child , very beautiful ; so when she grew up , no one was surprised that many handsome young blades came courting her . After a long while , she chose a fine man from New Orleans , and the wedding was planned . The groom was to bring friends from the city as his attendants and there would be a week of festivities before the ceremony . A few days before their arrival , the bride became strangely nervous and kept telling her parents , " They must n't come on the train . They must ride up on horseback . " But the mother and father thought it was just a romantic idea the girl had got from a novel and paid no attention until the day before the young men were due , the girl became distracted and begged her father to send the servants with horses to meet the train down below the " Piney Lonesome " flag stop and have the party ride up on horseback . Her father said the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young men 's clothes with splattered water and dirt . So the train bearing the groom and his friends came on toward the switch near Piney Lonesome where they 'd arranged for a special stop . And just as it came round the bend across the bottom land , the bride was running down the hill from the big house , screaming and waving a scarf , and she saw the train start over the river bridge and then the whole thing shivered and sank into the water . She fainted , and after they carried her to the house , she never left her bed , and a week later on the wedding day , she said , " The wine is sealed up , sealed up in the walls , " and died . That night her mother and father heard the clink of glasses downstairs , and a sort of murmur of laughter and music , but when they took candles into the ballroom , they could see no one . And soon afterward they died two days apart , very strangely . The servants who found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a glass of wine , but when they returned with help , the glass was gone , though no one else had been there . The house was abandoned after several people bought it and left on account of the ghostly wedding party that took place in the ballroom each anniversary . And on those nights , when the train approached the Yalobusha bridge , the engineer was flagged to a stop by a white woman , who then summoned him toward the old house ; and when he and his fireman would get out to follow , she disappeared . The railroad company tried to investigate , but could learn nothing . One night , when the train was flagged , some men went up the hill all the way to the house . They could see a faint glow in the ballroom windows , and shadows moving on the walls , and when they drew closer they heard laughter and music and tinkling glasses . One said he got to the windows quick enough to see the tables littered with wine bottles before the light and the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dust and crumbled plaster and cobwebs and broken panes , but somewhere far away in the house they could hear tiptoeing , and then silence . " Ooh-ooh-ooh ! " gurgled Taffy George , with a grin and a shudder of delight . On such visits , if the weather was fine , the boys might play outside while the grownups sat by the low fire and talked of their personal interests . From time to time , Tobe reported on the situation at the shops , when George inquired about chances of  | work there . Tension had recently grown up on a racial basis and seemed not to improve . " I hear all kinds o things , " Tobe said . " Men gettin beat up in the night , gettin letters tellin em to clear out of a white man 's job . Trouble is , a fireman 's s'posed to be promoted to engineer , but you know don none of us get a promotion an ai n't no nigger engineers . " " But ai n't the ' other jobs  --  like on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a get somethin , or else go back to bootblackin . " " They don want no black faces a-tall , ' less they 's black from coal dust . Three men I know done already quit , they so scared . " From the alley between the rows of shacks rose a confusion of high childish voices . George opened the door and looked out at the knot of quarreling boys . " Gwan away , " cried Henry Danny . " You stink like po white trash . " " Gim me my stick , " wailed Taffy George , reaching out his hands . Andrew drew back the broken-off broom handle and said , " I 'll give it to you on the noggin . Yella bastud ! " George was poised to step outside and settle the dispute , but now a pang of guilt shot through him and he felt limp and powerless to move or speak to the children . " Wa wa wa ! " jeered the neighbor children . " Yella bastud ! Yella bastud ! " " Go way , you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real boy game . " " Sissy ! Sissy ! " they all chanted cacophonously . " Yella sissy bas-tud ! " With a glimpse of Taffy George recoiling from the group , George closed the door and hoped no one in the room had been able to distinguish the words . From the window , as the tinny cracking of cans resumed , he watched . Taffy George stood a short distance from the others , his back turned , his head drooped , and he seemed to twist his fingers before him . The bent can rolled nearby and the older boys swept toward him . One pushed his shoulders , and Taffy George lurched a few steps forward . Then he walked to the small bridge at the head of the alley and began to arrange pebbles along the rail . George dropped the curtain and turned away . What could he  | do now to wipe out what he had done in the past ? What could change those boys in whom he had instilled , so that they kept it still alive , the hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to anyone so young ; explanations would n't overcome their habits anyhow , and they would n't be likely to care , even if they understood . Just the same , he must try , must find a way to change their attitudes . For now , instead of a living reminder of May 's unfaithfulness , Taffy George had become a reminder of his own harsh pride and cruelty . More often he approached Taffy George with invitations to games or reading stories , always with a disheartening foreknowledge of the chilly refusal . He could n't understand how a sixyear-old child could so consistently resist an opportunity to be amused and could be so self-reliant and contained . The boy could n't possibly sense George 's responsibility in his treatment . Or could he ? Day after day , while he sat idly through the winter , that question rankled in George 's mind . One evening he brought home a toy  --  a little box that made music when you cranked it , while a tin man jigged on the top . Dubiously the boy watched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence when George gave it to him . He merely stood still and held it . " Say , thank you , " prompted May . " Thank you , " responded the boy . " Thank you , Papa , " George corrected gently , with a smile he hoped would bring one in return . Taffy George gazed at him for a moment with his round dark eyes and then ran away . Henry Danny and Andrew both laughed deliriously and one of them shouted , " You ai n't is papa ! " " Dry up ! " snapped George . But through his anger he could detect a twinkle of joy in May 's eyes , before she lowered her face and called the boys to study . It was one of those old gramophone records that gave him an idea he thought would help . Without much attention , he had put on " It takes the Irish to beat the Dutch , " and in the midst of the song , he remembered the trick and told May . That night after supper , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Le 's invite the Dutch Doll to come ! " The boys seemed fascinated with the suggestion when she described the doll and  | what it could do ; and so George volunteered to go and ask the doll to come over . " I 'll have to stay with the chil'ren though , cause she cai n't leave em alone . " He went out the front door , slipped in again through the kitchen , while May played music , and then into the back bedroom . During the wait for his preparations , May explained to the children that they must be very quiet or the doll would go away . She could n't speak , but she could hear and she 'd answer their questions by nodding one time for yes and shaking her head for no . Then May herded them into the bedroom , dim from a lowturned lamp , and made them sit on the floor facing the big bed where a quilt hung from the mattress to the floor . " Now be real quiet , " she cautioned . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you come to see us ? " Nothing happened and she repeated her call . The quilt shook a bit and the children grew tense and murmured . " Dutch Doll , ai n't you gon na come see us ? " she intoned . Suddenly , with a quick upthrust from the bottom edge of the quilt , a figure slightly over a foot high appeared on the floor . It wore a tiny dress up to its thick neck and a rag tied around its head . The flat dark face , with huge white eyes and big red lips , kept twisting from side to side inquisitively . The children screamed shrilly . Henry Danny and Andrew went into giggles and fell upon each other and Taffy George slid in alarm toward his mother , who told them to quiet down . " Now le 's ask er some questions , " said May . " Le 's see . .. . Are these here good boys ? " The doll nodded once for yes , and the children laughed delightedly . " Do they study enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children made a sound of disagreement . " You see , " said May , " she knows everything . " " Aw , it 's a joke , " said Henry Danny . " Well , ask it a question an see . " " Am I gon na be rich ? " The doll 's answer was no . " What make Taffy George steal my playthings ? " asked Andrew . May scolded him , as the Dutch Doll whisked back under the quilt . " He don steal your things , Andrew , " she was saying . " Now  | you 've made the doll mad . See ? Dutch Doll , please come back . We 're sorry . " In a moment the figure reappeared and waited . " Is it alive ? " asked Andrew . " Ask er , " said May . " Is you alive ? " The doll nodded sagaciously . " Tha 's jus somebody under the bed makin it do that , " said Henry Danny . " Sh ! You 'll make er go way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pause before the child said , " Where 's my  --  real papa ? " The boys laughed wildly and the doll stood motionless . " It cai n't answer that , sugar , " said May hastily , afraid the doll was going to sink to the floor . " It jus says yes an ? " " Ai n't his papa a po white trash man ? " shouted Henry Danny , leaning forward close to the doll . But the doll vanished abruptly , there was a scuffing noise , the wall of quilt billowed outward and , as the two older boys whooped , Taffy George scrambled up and ran to his mother . George rolled from under the bed and rose , tearing the dress from his arm , and glared down at his sons . " I don want a hear no mo o that kind o talk , " he shouted . The boys ' gaiety died away , and they sat fearful with their faces raised to his . " George , " May began . " They jus did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na whup the tar out o you both , " he continued , ignoring her . " Mind what I say . " " Yessuh , " the boys whispered . In the following silence , they got up uneasily and went out . Conscious now of the dress wadded in his fist , George flung it to the floor . Taffy George was clasping his mother 's waist and leaning his face against her . May patted him consolingly , but said nothing . The fury that distorted George 's features softened , as she watched him , into an aching pity . Moving to her side , he let his hand sink onto Taffy George 's head and shook it tenderly . " Sonny . . . " he said . But there was no answer . The grotesque face on the back of his hand grinned up at him .  | 27 Tobe handed him the note , printed in pencil on a blue-lined sheet from a school tablet . " Silas done read it to me , " he said . " I jus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters on the paper : White men 's jobs ai nt for niggers . You better quit yours or you wont live long . Signed : Zulus . IIe looked questioningly at Tobe 's rugged face but said nothing . " Three firemen done already quit , " Tobe murmured . " You better quit too , " Annie put in , and , biting a thread from her stitching , continued through clenched teeth : " Ai n't no use beatin yo head against a wall . " " I ai n't gon quit . I been working there almos fifteen years . " " What did Silas think ? " asked George . " He would n't say . He said take it to the police . " " They ai n't gon na pay it no mind . You reckon they 'll send em to me an the other helpers ? " asked George , with a sudden anxiety about his job . He had idled for several months after his return from the army camp , meeting constant refusal of the shop foreman to reinstate him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  mowing lawns , house cleaning , delivering  --  he felt these were for boys . If he and May had been in desperate need of money , he would have consented to do such work , but now he did n't want to lose the dignity of his standing , if not as a professional man like Silas , at least as a company employee with higher pay than Silas . He persisted , in spite of his awareness of the rising resentment of the whites , and at length he managed to persuade the shop foreman to take him back on as boilermaker 's helper . Was he now to be kicked out , scared out , burned out , like you smoked a possum out of a hollow tree ? " Don no white men want them jobs , " said Tobe . " But they fraid we want to be engineers , like we s'posed to be . They done taken away our seniority . Now they want all the good jobs . " " I spec you better quit , " said George . " Tha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit , " said Annie .  | " I ai n't gon na do it . I 'll kill em if they start at me . " " That wo n't get you nowhere , " said George . " Tobe . . . " pled Annie . " Don start no trouble . ' Member po Henry  --  an all . " " Wo n't get you nowhere to lie down an let em walk over you either . " " If the white men say quit , you better quit , " said George . " Why ? " shouted Tobe , startling Annie so that she pricked her finger with the needle . He stamped the floor , rose and , catching up his chair , banged it down . " Why 've I got a do ev'ything they say ? Why ai n't I got no say-so  --  no rights ? " " Do n't fly off the handle so , Tobe , " Annie soothed . " You know it 's always been like that , an always will be . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worse'n it used to be . They get scareder an scareder all the time . So we got a stop bein scared o them . We got a stand up fo our rights . " " It don do no good , Tobe , " said George . " You know it . You ai n't got no rights but what they give you . " " The 's got a be some way to get em  --  or some way to make em give em to us . " His rage was subsiding but he still paced fitfully about the room . " I don know what way tha 's goin to be . Don help to kill em any more'n it helps them to kill us . Why cai n't they see that , same as me ? " " Cause they don see a rope an a fire when they kill us . " " George , " said Annie . " Y'all talk about somethin else . Or else go somewhere else . Go down to Silas ' , go ask him . He knows Tobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my job after all these years , " said Tobe . " The hell with em ! Screw em ! " " Tobe , honey , " said Annie , " think about me . I rather have you alive an haulin garbage than  --  stickin to yo job . " " Mama 's right , Tobe . " " Piss on em . They ai n't gon scare me away . They wo n't even let a nigger haul garbage anyhow  --  tha 's a city job . " " Well , will you listen to Silas ? " asked George . " Will you do what e says ? He 'll talk to me . " " I 'll do what 's my right to do ... go on firin a engine , like I done for fifteen years . " " Who cares how long , honey ? " said Annie . " I 'll go see im anyhow . Maybe he can convince you . "  | But Silas offered no comfort or advice . He agreed with George that it would be dangerous for Tobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to leave his job , " Silas ended sadly . " It 's just not in me to tell him to run for his life when he 's done nothing wrong . " " Ma 's awful worried , " said George . " It 'd ease her mind a lot if you could persuade im ? " " Persuade him to be a coward , when he 's just found out he 's a man ? " Silas finished , with a cutting look at George . " Better'n bein a man jus long enough to get killed , ai n't it ? " " Yes , if you think only of your own life . " " What else think of ? " " I guess it sounds crazy and like preaching  --  but there is something else , something in all of us that we stand up for , and if we do n't , our life is dirty . That 's why you got to think about all of us  --  us Negroes , and those whites . We can remember being slaves , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but they make us slaves through fear . If Tobe decides he 's not going to fear any more and not going to live dirty inside , I wo n't stop him . Because if the white men kill him , they 'll know they 've made their own lives dirty . And kill him or not , they 'll know he stopped being a slave and stood up like a man . Without that , are we getting anywhere  --  moving forward at all ? Are we keeping the skimpy love a few whites used to have for us ? Are we gaining the respect we ought to have as long as we act the slave they want to see ? Will they respect a murdered Negro as a man any more than a living Negro coward ? " He watched George , whose painful perplexity showed in his face , and halted his quiet speech . The white men , thought George , would hardly even know of Tobe 's death and would n't care if they did . He turned his eyes slowly from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either , " said Silas , as if George had spoken . " But some day the white man 's guilt will be so enormous he ca n't bear it in the face of his own shame , and he 'll begin to smother in it . Then he 'll have to give respect to others , even just as human beings , and it 'll be good to have a lot to hold up for their respect . " He waited a moment to see if George was following his reasoning , and said , " Tobe will be forgotten by then . Nobody will hold him up for respect . But right now his decision may help and strengthen others  --  others who will be respected ,  | maybe sooner because of Tobe 's effect . That 's one way we grow , I guess . . . . I hope nothing bad happens . " From the confusion of his thoughts , George could bring out no response , for his mind seemed to have turned aside from Tobe 's plight to focus on Taffy George . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had encouraged in his own two sons , the same contempt that white men heaped on Negroes . Taffy must know a double scorn  --  that of being white and that of being Negro  --  and must even now be resisting the slavery of hatred  --  Silas ' phrase from long ago  --  that George , unaware of its consequences , had tried to perpetuate in his family . No doubt the boy was already draw . ing from Tobe the strength that Silas mentioned , and from Silas , too , for he could talk with Silas in an open , unrestrained way which the boy denied to George . But was it more from Tobe , he wondered , than from the teacher that Taffy would absorb an attitude toward the world ? Was the reason he asked to hear the stories , not always of ghosts , but of Tobe 's life more so than Annie 's compliant one , that they taught him , like parables , things unspecified in Silas ' lessons ? In particular , George remembered one episode which seemed to impress the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit at his feet and said nothing for a long time : " My uncle Finis was the blacksmith on the place , " Tobe had commenced , " and I used to try to help him in the shop , whenever I was n't working in the fields . I 'd keep up the fire and pump the bellows . I was about eight , I guess , and the war was still going on . " Mr. Aloysius Bardey , the plantation owner , had come home on a short leave , and everyone could tell from looking at him that things were pretty bad . The Union troops were pushing down on them  --  in Tennessee and along the Mississippi River . Just at sundown , when the field hands were leaving the corn planting , Tobe had run through the fading twilight to the blacksmith shed to watch his uncle 's work . He drew up short at the tree near the door , but neither Uncle Finis nor Mr. Wishus , silhouetted by the glow from the forge , noticed him . They were quarreling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from his body , as if they were distasteful . Tobe never knew the cause of their dispute ; he heard his uncle say in a sad voice , " I ai n't never been whipped , Mr. Wishus , an you cai n't do it . " There was the barest of silences until the leather bands coiled  | on the earthen floor , when Mr. Wishus flung them away , with a licking sound . " Well , I can kill you , " he said , and drew his pistol and shot . Tobe could n't move or speak . And when Miz Wishus Bardey ran up , crying , " Aloysius , what have you done ? " the captain was leaning against the jamb , with his head hung down and shaking from side to side , side to side , as if he who must have known what it was about were wondering why it had happened . When Taffy George spoke at last , it had been to ask , " Was you ever whipped ? " " My ma an pa is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . The silence between George and Silas extended on and on , and George almost forgot that the teacher was no longer talking . " How the boys doin in school ? " he asked at last . " Well , you know about Henry Daniel and Andrew well as I do , " said Silas wearily . " At least , May does . She tries to make them study , and I try , but they do n't try to learn . They 're not interested . They play hooky a lot . I do n't know really ... " " An Taffy George ? " Silas chuckled and shifted in his chair . " From what I hear , he 'll soon be catching up with the other two . Of course , I do n't teach the lower grades where Taffy is , now that the school 's so much bigger . But Miss Crawford says he recites better than any of the class . " " He studies too much , " said George . " He don play enough . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , and then made a gesture of dismissal with his hands . " That 's nothing to worry about . He 's not very outgoing , but he 'll get along . He likes books and studying , I think . " " The boys don play with im at home . They leave im out . I think e 's lonesome , tha 's why e studies . " " It may be , George , " said Silas quietly . " I tried to play catch with im las Sunday , an e would n't . All the other kids playin ball in the field there , an e jus sat in the swing readin . " " Be patient with him . He 's different from the rest . " " Does e play at recess ? Does e have any buddies at school ? " " No , George , he does n't , " Silas answered , with no attempt to soften the emphatic tone .  | " Why not ? " Silas rocked his chair in contemplation , lifted his hands and dropped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why 's he different ? " " Well ? " " Is it cause is father ? ? " " Of course not . After all , Miss Lucy and May ? Well , you ca n't explain these things , George . I 'm black as soot  --  why did I want to study ? I do n't know exactly . " " But you had friends an played around an had fun . " " Sure . But Taffy is still a child . " " He 's ' leven , goin on twelve . " " All right . " Silas sounded ready to drop the subject . When George did n't resume , he shifted the emphasis slightly . " You ought to see the new wing we 've built on the school with that grant we got . It 's no great shakes , even now , but better than when I came here . Four teachers to help me , and I can even almost graduate pupils . I 'm trying to get the full twelve grades set up . " He waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had n't heard . Though George 's eyes were fixed on Silas , their search was inward . " Do they make fun of im ? " he asked shortly . " Do they tease im ? " " Yes . " " My boys ? " " Them , and some others . " Then , seeing George 's lips compress in anger , Silas continued . " But not much . Taffy 'll be all right . He ignores them . " " On the outside , he maybe does . " Silas glanced up sharply in surprise . " And what about the in-side ? " " I try to make em act diff'rent , " George said . ' " They do it behind my back . " " I mean Taffy 's inside . " " Oh . . . " He rubbed his palms on his knees and stared at the rug . " He knows who to blame , I guess . He 's found out that much without studyin . " As days passed without any ominous signs , George began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zulus . Though many must know of the warning letter , nobody at the shops in-  | dicated any knowledge of the possibility of his danger except his engineer . Tobe reported that he had seemed astonished each time he came on the job and after five days had remarked , " I heard you was quittin the railroad . " Tobe had assured him that he intended to keep on working and the engineer had said , " Oh ? just a rumor , eh ? " And shortly after that , he did n't think too often or seriously about the letter  --  probably a bluff , he suggested . Some two weeks later , George had washed his hands at a hydrant just after the evening whistle and was pacing down the cindery network of rails , when he saw the engine puff off the turntable at the roundhouse and chug slowly down the tracks . The headlight was on to cut the increasing dusk . George moved well out of its path  --  too many men got killed in railroad work just through carelessness  --  and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tracks away and the glare of the headlight was gone , he saw Tobe waving back from the cab door , gaily shouting something which George could n't hear . He waved and walked on behind the more rapidly moving engine toward the end of the yards where the huge fan of rails squeezed into double tracks between the backs of buildings and a street , before it entered the open business section and the stretch along the depot . Though he had n't noticed that the engine had stopped , probably beyond the yard limits alongside the rear of the stores , he was apparently looking at the taillight far down the right of way , for he saw the flash and heard its explosion a second later . He waited motionless , insisting that he must have seen wrong , he must be imagining wrong . But then he heard faintly the shouts  --  from the engineer ? . . . for the police ? ? and he began to run toward the engine no longer able to deny what he knew he would find .  | 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer his mother . As soon as he saw the Model T stop in front of the house , he had dropped the history book he was reading and slipped through the back door into the thickets behind the line of privies . Much as he would enjoy a ride on such a warm spring day , he did n't want to have it with Uncle Columbus and his skinny , awkward wife Mazella . In the idle period while the recently flooded fields dried enough to permit plowing and planting , they had driven in their second-hand car from the Delta plantation for a couple of days . Already he had had to visit them at Granma 's and sit crowded on the porch listening to reminiscences of their childhood , with Granma telling tales her sons did n't remember and them telling some she 'd never heard of . Aunt Mazella , her face as if molded of shoe polish in the heat and her hair parted in a geometric pattern with its braids drawn back and pinned , cackled shrilly at each story and kept exclaiming , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jus like C'lumbus ? " The only thing that had interested him was Uncle Columbus ' account of the big flood earlier that spring  --  water rising daily against the levees , men working all night with sandbags , and the levee finally breaking and the water gushing through , overflowing the fields and houses and then the towns , and the animals , even some people , drowning and the bodies floating with the currents , and the families and cattle and chickens taking refuge on ancient Indian mounds and the boats going back and forth on rescue trips . " Taffy ! Come on  --  we 're ready to go , " called May from the back door . Then in a lower tone , " He 's out there in the brush , I think . " " I 'll see if I can get im . " It was Papa 's voice . Though he could never speak the name Papa to Henry , self-consciously avoiding any term of address , he thought of him these days in that way , but not without some conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep into his thinking to replace he and him , but  | with no clear conception of his motives beyond the references of his half-brothers , he had resisted the thought as long as he could . He bent over the capped fruit jar that rested in a tangle of grass beneath the locust tree where they had once tied him for an Indian torture . The water in the jar looked milky dead after sitting a week , and when he shook it , the long hair from a horse 's tail floated up in a lethargic coil . The voice was nearer now , and through the leafy branches he could see George approaching . " Sonny ! " He might as well answer . It would be silly to run and hide . Why could n't they forget him , leave him alone . " Here I am . " " Come on . We goin ridin . What you doin out here ? " George stopped at the edge of the thicket , as Taffy started toward him . " Lookin to see if that horsetail had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it ? " " Naw . " " Do n't you want a go ridin with us ? " " Oh  --  I guess so . " Emerging from the clump of bushes , he pushed quickly past George , thinking Do n't you touch me , and went through the house to the front . The car , at the foot of the bank , seemed too small for the group waiting to get in it . Granma Annie , already seated in the front , was waving a fan against the heat that bore down from the oilcloth-patched top . Talking in lively confusion beside the open doors stood May , Columbus , Mazella , Henry Danny and Andrew , and as Taffy and his father came down the ramshackle steps , everyone began to pile into the car . From the nearby porches , the neighbors watched with amusement and envy . " You gon na bust a spring , " one of them shouted . Uncle Columbus was the only one who knew how to drive , and his wife , luckily so thin , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa and Mama crowded into the back with the older boys , one far back on the seat and the other on the edge ? " Make yo'self small , " advised Mazella  --  and Taffy was supposed to sit on a low wooden box between Henry 's knees . The last one outside , he hesitated , with a foot on the running board . " . I better stay home an study some , " he said . All their voices rose in a clamorous protest in which he could  | hear scornful exclamations from the boys . Then as they quieted , George said , " It 'll be fun , sonny . " Taffy was about to slam the door and stick to his decision when he saw Papa make a slight movement as if to climb out . He looked into Papa 's eyes and then , piqued that the threat of humiliating sacrifice should trap him , got in and sat on the box . Columbus let the car roll down the hill and pushed the clutch pedal to make the engine turn over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her " boarder " sat on the porch , they all waved and screamed . But at the bottom , the motor had n't started , and he had to crank it by hand . Each time the engine chugged , the car would move forward slightly , and Annie would shriek , " It 's runnin away ! Hol ' this thing , C'lumbus ! " At last the engine was running , and they rode back up the hill and through the town toward the highway . " You mus be gettin rich farmin , " said George , " if you can affo 'd one o these . " " I 'm doin all right , I guess , " returned Columbus , " but ai n't nobody gettin rich sharecroppin . Made enough las ' crop to pay fo this car , but we in the hole fo all the winter now . " " You 'd ought a saved yo money , " said Granma Annie . " Oh , tha 's the way it works out , anyhow .

We lucky to be on his place , an I reckon he 'll be pretty fair to us long as good prices hold . " " You be buyin one o them radios next , " said May . " Hey ! There 's the Lasses White Minstrels comin , " exclaimed George . They were passing a large billboard plastered with a poster announcing the show above a picture of the line of entertainers , dressed in red evening suits with white lapels , with Mr. Bones and Mr. Tambo in green and the Interlocutor in white . " Le 's all go  --  wha ' cha say ? " The children leaped at the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cai n't sit on them little toothpick planks . I 'm ' fraid they 'll bust through an drop me on the ground . "  | " Well , we 'll all go an take the chil'ren , " said May . " Too bad C'luinbus an Mazella wo n't be here . " " Oh , we sees em in the Delta sometime , " said Mazella . " If we got the cash an the strength to go . " " Heard that Bessie Smith few years back , " said Columbus . " Boy ! you ever hear her sing ? " " We got two records of Cr , " said May . " She really knows how . " " Aw , tha 's ole-timey slow stuff , " said Henry Danny . " Unh-uh !

" asked George . " No , it ai n't . If I thought Cora 'd turn up in one of em , I 'd go to ev'y single show . But she done really gone , po thing . Gone like it was the grave . " Annie suddenly twisted and pointed to two girls walking up the roadside . " Look at em nigger flappers , " she cried . " Don they jus beat all ! Dresses over the ' knees an paint on the ' faces ! " " Tha 's the styles , Miss Annie , " said May . " They pushin it so far the top o the ' do 's an the bottom 's gon na meet in the middle . That 'll be a style , all right . " " Be a eye-catcher , anyhow , " said Columbus . The car had crossed the city limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals larger cars , new sedans , honked and whooshed past them , throwing a tinny sprinkle of pebbles on the hood and windshield , and stirred a thin tan cloud along the road . Up ahead , a file of Negroes , graduated from the children in the lead to the parents at their back , plodded through the weeds on the highway shoulder . " Law ' , they jus a-eatin dust , I bet , " said Annie , as if she were n't fanning it away from her own face . " He sho ballin the jack , " said Henry Danny , as another big car raced by . " Tha 's one o them eight-cylinder jobs . " " You ai n't a-woofin , boy , " said Andrew .  | Cramped in the narrow space around his box , Taffy George leaned with his hands on the front seat and rested his chin on them . Over Mazclla 's and Granma Annie 's shoulders he could see the hot road winding ahead between fields and patches of woods . Papa clapped him on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , now ? " He nodded and gave an apathetic grunt , which concealed the real enjoyment he found in the ride , as long as he could forget Henry Daniel and Andrew . " He ai n't never glad o nothin , " Henry Danny muttered . " He 's a sourpuss . " " An you 're a drug-sto ' sheik , " retorted Taffy George . " Aw  --  Henry Danny , " chided May . " You don realize when Taffy 's havin fun . You must n't say those things . " " Ev'ybody says it , " said Andrew . If they do , thought Taffy George , it 's because polecats like you told them to . He could remember vividly those few times in the schoolyard at recess when he had been playing with children in his grade  --  leapfrog was the first time  --  and Henry Daniel had sauntered over from his older gang to whisper and snicker to a friend of Taffy 's . Later when Taffy was a frog , the boy smacked his back so hard in leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . " Aw , you puny as a gal , " the boy sneered . " Gwan an play hopscotch . " After that , when he had gradually won back his standing with the boys in his class , it was in snap the whip that he next realized his brothers ' undermining work . The boys who clutched his hand would let go and send him whirling to the ground and jeer at his ineptitude . They ceased to welcome his appearance in their group , called him " teacher 's pet " and " goody-goody , " and even when they accepted him in a game , they would try to humiliate him so they could laugh . Playing hide and seek they let him hide in the thickets on the bluff , but no one else continued the game and he sat in the bushes till the bell rang and he was tardy for marching in . Sometimes in baseball they threw at his stomach or his feet ; they tripped him , accidentally on purpose , in running ; they put bent pins on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times they pelted him with spitballs during a study period . He had borne it as well as he knew how , knowing no reason for their taunts except " him " ? Papa , as he now thought of him  --  and no defense against them except evasion or mean tricks . Neither con-  | soled him , least of all the tricks . He remembered pounding a shard of glass to bits and mixing it with food for Henry Danny 's old feint dog , and then running to hide his tears in the woods behind their shack . And once , on a rainy day , when Andrew was sprawled napping on the sofa , he had cleverly smeared mud on the upholstery by Andrew 's shoes so Mama would scold and whip him when she came home . But now Henry Danny and Andrew , after repeated failures in tests and refusals to study , had quit school , and those incidents were all in the past . He felt more at ease and more accepted in the games , for his schoolmates quickly forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still reticent , and in his distrust of friends , he turned to study or lonely games . In the evenings he could n't avoid seeing his brothers at home , though he had some hours of relief before they came from their jobs . Henry Danny , crazy about autos , had gone to work for Mr. Ashley 's gas and service station , located where the livery stable used to be , and Andrew was a delivery boy for Mr. Williams ' drug store . They sassed their father often , now that they earned a little money and felt independent , and got sullen when he talked sternly to them . " What 're you tryin to make us like that like him for ? " they would grumble . " We ai n't no powder puffs . " " You ai n't too big fo me to take a buggy whip to , either , " Papa would answer ; and Taffy George could see in his face the effort to control his temper . " I 'm jus tryin to help you grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to school an study , an you run aroun at night . " " Talk like you never did , " retorted Andrew . " I never had the chances you got . I want you to be better'n me , " said Papa . " I guess he 's better'n you an us too , " said Henry Danny , " cause he 's a ole bookworm . You always take is part against us . " " I do n't mean to . I mean to be fair as I can an I mean you should too . " " Aw  --  come on , Andrew , " said Henry Danny disgustedly . " We got a meet our dates . " But longer ago , back when he was about six or seven , there had been his brothers ' terrifying joke  --  were they really playing a joke , he could now wonder , or were they unconsciously in earnest ? ? when they suggested a game of cowboys and Indians and tied him to the locust tree . He still had a sharp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun flecking through the leaves , and a couple of birds cheeping  --  an image that fixed  | with icy permanence in his mind when the two boys turned on him with an open jackknife and pulled down his pants . " Do we cut it all off or jus half ? " asked Andrew . " All , I guess . Pa say he wo n't need it ' cept to make some mo yella bastuds . " Taffy was pleading breathlessly but he did n't know what he was saying . The boys retreated and for a moment he thought it might be just a realistic game ; then they returned with a bunch of ripe elderberry tops . They mashed the berries into dark juicy pulp and flung it at his groin . " Why , he 's beginnin to look like a nigger bastud now , " laughed Henry Danny . " Yeah , " answered Andrew . " Might as well cut it off now . " As they approached with the knife extended , he began to scream insanely , for hours it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother was untying the cords . He was n't injured , but he felt sick all night , sleepless or with nightmares , and suffused with an overpowering fear and hatred of his brothers . " Sho do , " Henry Danny echoed his brother , as the car jiggled roughly down a washboard strip in the gravel . " Ev'ybody say e 's a sourpuss . " " Well , hush now , " said George . " This car sho goin buckity-buck , " called Annie . " Gon rattle my teeth right out a my head . " " We really high-tailin now , " laughed Henry Danny . The car whirled around a sharp curve , its course wavering as the narrow wheels skidded in the banked gravel and flung pebbles into the weeds , and Annie screamed and the others laughed . They rushed on the level stretches , coasted giddily and quietly down winding grades and grunted slowly uphill . The radiator began to spew out a thin wisp of steam . " Engine 's gettin hot , " remarked Columbus . " Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gon na bust , is it ? " asked Annie . They stopped beside a bridge and Columbus unscrewed the radiator cap , which popped into the air under a spurt of steam . Again Annie uttered her high little shriek and began to laugh at her nervousness . " I jus ai n't sure the Lawd meant us to ride in these contraptions , " she said . " They too scary fo me . " " Aw , you know you like it , " said Columbus , plunging down the bank to dip branch water into a bucket . When the engine was cooled , they turned back toward town .  | About halfway back an explosion came  --  and one from Annie too , of course  --  followed by a short hissing , a wobbling of the car and then the crunching bump of a flat tire . Everyone groaned and when the car stopped they poured out from all the doors . " Right in the sun , too , " growled Columbus , " like it always is . " He and George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set about changing the tire while the women lined up on the bank , fanning away the dust thrown up by passing cars . Taffy George strolled down the roadside toward a clump of trees looming metallic in the afternoon sun , and ignored his mother 's call that he must n't go too far . He ought to have walked the other way instead of toward town , so as to make it more difficult for them to reach him . What did he care if they left him behind ? He 'd come across a farm where he could hire out ; or he 'd get to the railroad and hobo to some other town and find work , and as with Aunt Cora , they 'd never hear from him again or know what happened . But then he would n't finish school , and there were more things he wanted to know ; after he graduated he would run away . He stood in the shade of the trees and gazed back at the black lump of automobile with the men moving and squatting around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was climbing into the seats while Columbus bent at the crank . When the car drew up alongside him , he entered silently and sat on the box between Papa 's knees for the return to town .  | 29 On the bluff to the north of Possum Hollow , Taffy George was picking blackberries for Granma Annie when they appeared on the city dump below . Apparently neither Henry Danny nor Andrew nor their companion knew he was there , but their distant voices rose up to him without his distinguishing the words , and for a while he watched to see what they were doing . They searched about in the refuse , keeping to the side where discarded house furnishings were piled and away from the lower fetid heap of garbage , buzzing with gnats and green flies . Andrew yelled and held up a sofa pillow which he flung to the turf on the edge of the dump . Henry Danny was carrying away a broken chair . These things must be for the clubroom they had mentioned  --  a smokehouse on a deserted farm to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly allusions , were ready for anything . Taffy George turned back to filling his pail with berries and had almost forgotten them when he heard an automobile . After a glance to see that it was the garbage truck weaving along the double track worn in the grass , he paid no attention until the voices below , now more than three , grew loud with anger . As he looked , a bottle , pale twinkling blue in the light , flew across the clump from the lower section where two young white men had shoveled the last of the rubbish off the truck . Henry Danny returned a broken vase , and instantly the air seemed arced with a barrage of objects . Bottles , bricks , pitchers , cans , pans , dry-cell batteries , stove lids , old lanterns and lamps sailed back and forth . Occasional shouts and curses broke out indistinctly . Andrew grabbed his left arm as if hurt . Hope they knock their brains out , thought Taffy George . His brothers and their friend were retreating , stooping for things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two white men were scrambling up the slope of trash onto a more plentiful source of missiles . Taffy thought he saw the bottle crash against Henry Danny 's head  --  a metallic brightness suddenly fixed on the tan face and then dropping  --  and good , he thought , serves  | him right . But maybe he only saw Henry Danny 's movements freeze and then his body begin to sag and fall to the ground . Taffy George 's arms reached a bit forward , his legs started without leaving the spot , and he cursed the white men . Below , Andrew was helping his stunned brother to his feet while the other boy kept throwing back everything as fast as he could . Then the three of them vanished on the run around the curve of the lane . The white men stopped and turned to slide and lurch down to their truck . When Taffy George got home he found Henry Danny lying on the sofa with a thick cloth tied all around his eyes . He did n't really feel much pity but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances . But maybe it was Henry Danny 's fault  --  the fault of his meanness . Andrew was rubbing liniment on his arm and twisting his wrist to see if a bone was broken . " Where 'd they hit you ? " he asked Henry Danny . " Right on the side o my eye . Bastuds ! " " Ma 's gone fo the doctor or some medicine , " said Andrew . " What started you fightin white men ? " " They yelled how 'd we like some o their truck load an threw a shovelful up at us , " said Henry Danny . " Jeez , this hurts . Like a pile driver goin ninety miles a minute . " " We tole em to mind their own business an en they th'ew things at us , " Andrew continued . " How come you know bout it ? " " I saw the end of it . " " Why n't you come help ? Lily-livered ? " " I could n't get there . I was up on the bluff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to . " Horse feathers ! " said Andrew . " I 'm all swole up like a balloon , " moaned Henry Danny . " Did we hit em any ? " " Not to hurt em , " said Taffy George with pleasure . " You want anything ? " " Hell naw . Jus shut up an leave me alone . " Taffy George walked down to Aunt Martha 's to tell her about the incident and when he returned his mother was there with Dr. Robert Murchison . They had moved Henry Danny into the bedroom . The bandage was off his head , exposing a great discolored bulge which spread from the temple over the right eye , hiding it completely , and decreased in puffed flesh on the other eye  | and the cheeks . The doctor talked in hushed but firm tones , but Henry Danny said nothing and did n't move at all . Andrew was standing by the mantel looking woebegone . " I thought e was dead , " said Andrew in an awed voice . " All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk or move . " Doctor Robert gave May some medicines with instructions about using them and dressing the wound . " I do n't think any bones are broken , but I ca n't tell till the swelling goes down . Probably a slight concussion . Keep him quiet , lying down , when he comes to  --  that ought n't to be very long . Let me know if there 's any change or he do n't regain consciousness soon . " Henry Danny did n't stir until late that night . They sat around , tense with uncertainty , and when Papa came home , he was furious and anxious and had to be kept from shaking the boy to rouse him . " Do n't , " said Mama . " You must n't do that . He has to lie quiet . " Aunt Martha had come , bringing all the ice from her icebox to help their waning supply keep the ice bag cool ; and had gone , lavishing on them whatever consolation she could . Now , while the others waited inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debating whether to summon the doctor , Taffy George sat on the dark porch and heaped chagrin on himself . He had wanted Henry Danny 's brains knocked out and now they really were . Was n't he sorry ? he repeated to himself at intervals . And though he answered promptly yes I am , it was followed always by a but , ghostly and shameful and ineradicable . At last , he heard a flurry of voices . Henry Danny had called , " Ma . . . Ma . . . What time is it ? " and everyone was at his side . Papa began questioning him , as if he were n't satisfied with what Andrew and Taffy George had told , but Ma soon stopped him . " Let im rest . You jus make is head hurt worse . " " It 's bout to bust , " moaned Henry Danny . Within a few days , Henry Danny felt much better , complaining sometimes of light headaches , but as far as Doctor Robert could tell , making fine improvement . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the lids were beginning to open . Most of the time Henry Danny kept a towel and the ice bag on his face , and in a burst of guilty compassion Taffy George asked him if he wanted to be read to . p 300 " I got Treasure Island here , " he offered , " and Enoch Arden , but tha 's poetry . You would n't like it . " " Naw . Ai n't you got something exciting ? " " Ma 's got some ole books some lady give her a while ago . I 'll look . " He returned to the bedroom with several and read the titles for Henry Danny to choose . " Beverly of Graustark , V.V. 's Eyes , Tartan and the Jewels of Opar , The Recreation of Brian Kent , Black Oxen , The Beautiful and Damned ... " " That sounds all right , " said Henry Danny . " Read that one . " And as a kind of penance , Taffy George would read at the bedside each day . It was not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother had become neutralized  --  but that he was ashamed of himself . Before long he had neutralized his shame too , and then his feeling was one of pleasure in his superiority , such as one knew in being kind to a sick animal found in the street . Old sick Henry Danny , lying on his pillow with a cold towel over his bashed-in eyes , had to depend on Taffy the Bookworm for any amusement he could get . And of course , Henry Danny was going to miss the minstrel show ; Papa had said he would take them after all , since Henry Danny was doing so much better and had no serious injuries . But when the night came , Mama decided to stay home and watch after Henry Danny . After they had spruced up a bit , so as not to look too shabby and sweaty even in the hot night , they started out to the south end of town where the show tent was pitched in a meadow . On the way George told them about how he used to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give at noon to drum up business for the evening performance . The banners , swaying from a high pole , were of vivid silk with fringe at the bottom and bore writing and decorations in gold or silver . He and the other colored boys would walk ahead of the line or at the sides or sometimes even between the groups . First there were the big bosses wearing fancy clothes and riding on the finest chestnuts and calicos the livery stable could provide , and behind them came the rented carriages , tops folded back , with all the actresses in glittering dresses and white plumes bobbing on their hats and maybe carrying ruffled parasols , and after them a bunch of men walking , some in outlandish checked frock-tail  | coats and some in high-toned suits and stovepipe hats , and then at the very last the band , all red and gold glints and braid , playing a jazzy march you could hear up the whole street , and led by the drum major strutting and twirling his baton and shaking his tall helmet and the cords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at the wide intersection by the bank and give a short concert , but George said he never got to see them on the stage because they acted at the opera house which had no space set aside for Negroes . " But they don do that no more , " he finished . " Ev'ythin 's goin too fast an don nobody like em much now . Even got movies that talk , I hear . But it sho was purty to watch when I was a li'l boy and we did n't have much purty to look at . I 'd a run off an joined a show like yo Aunt Cora did , only I could n't sing good as her . " When they reached the brown canvas tent , festive and exciting with the crowds and the strings of light bulbs and the band playing , George bought their tickets at the special booth " for colored " and they pushed through the opening to find seats . Taffy George took a deep breath of the odors of sawdust underfoot , hot peanuts , sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make-up , musical instruments , musty costumery ? ? that hangs under the vault of a tent show . With a pleasant nervousness , he climbed the rickety bleachers at the left rear and they perched , jammed against their laughing , joking neighbors , on the thin planks . Papa bought them candy and nuts ; and then the band came inside to play before the stage and the lights went on on the curtain , painted in red and yellow like a city street with funny signs on the buildings . Taffy leaned to his father and whispered , " I got a pee . " " Well , hol ' it , " said George with a laugh . " I don know where you go ' less it 's jus out in the dark . " " I guess I can hol ' it . " When the curtain went up on the half-circle of singers seated before a backdrop of columns and looped-up curtains and foliage , he forgot about everything but the entertainment . Various men sang  --  a real deep song about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about frivolous Sal , then a sentimental quartet and a funny song  --  and in between the actors danced soft-  | shoe and tap and one played a cornet solo and one a banjo  --  he sounded like a train , like he said he would  --  and they cracked lots of jokes . " Mr. Bones , " said the grand white man in the center , " why are you always eating licorice drops ? " ( Taffy realized he meant to say liquish drops , but that did n't matter . ) " Is it because you really like them ? " " No sub ! I don like em a-tall , " answered Mr. Bones . " But my wife jus died an I 's in mournin . " Everyone was enjoying the show , laughing , yelling and applauding . Later , when the chorus of " high-browns " came out , there were rocketing whistles , even from the white section , and when a woman sang , " Swe-e-et Papa , treetop tall , wo n't you come an turn my damper down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shouts of delight from the audience . Then one of the men , dressed up funny like a woman in red satin and feathers and ropes of beads , came out and cut up with a man . " I 've lived fifty years , " bellowed the man-woman , Miss Flewiana Wilkins , reaching coyly for the man , " an I ai n't never made no man happy . " " You in the same boat as my wife , " the real man answered . After they had danced a flirtatious comic jig , the curtain came down and a man appeared to make a stump speech . " Ladies an genulmens , " he said , " you all will have to pardon me fo bein so black  --  I been sick . In our family we gets blacker as we grows older  --  an I 's the baby . They calls me Red . " The audience laughed , and Taffy George was surprised to notice that those around him were the loudest ; it did n't seem very funny to him and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the comedian was goin on , " why , he 's so black the lightnin bugs flies aroun him in the daytime . " A roar of laughter  --  they were slapping their thighs and each other 's backs in such high spirits that Taffy imagined something personally directed at him was in it . Then he realized their amusement lay in acceptance , for he heard them take up the joke , one calling another " Red , " and someone saying , " Get that lightnin bug off'n yo head ! " The guffaws subsided and the actor went on : " An we ai n't never in our lives seen my oldest brother  --  we jus hears him walkin aroun . " In the hilarity , Taffy George 's attention , diverted by his bewilderment at their fun , gradually slipped away from the comedian . He no longer heard the jokes and the noise of appreciation  | was only a far-off rumbling . For all he knew the speaker was still talking about deeper and deeper shades of blackness . He could n't figure out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folding benches below . His father  --  Papa , rather  --  had laughed , but then he was dark , not even high brown like the chorus girls . But no one had laughed at the girls ; in fact , they had whistled and yelled to show they approved and were attracted . Black skin , the symbol of slavery as he had read of it in the history book and as Granma Annie had pictured it in tales when he was still younger , was funny , it seemed . Not the skin of Hebrew slaves in the Bible , or Grecian slaves or Christian slaves or any slaves at all ; just black skin , dark skin , Negro skin , slave skin . For was n't the usual attitude that all those others had been " enslaved , " while Negroes were born to be slaves ? So was slavery funny ? Often in Granma 's stories it almost sounded that way , but it was only because sometimes they had fun . In her life there had been a pleasant association with the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there had been banjo and fiddle music for them to sing and dance to around their cabins , she had told him , and the Murchisons had been good to her and her parents . With those who came before them , who had other masters , things had n't been so jolly ; Granma Annie could remember a little of the stories she had heard from her mother and father . The McNeals who owned him had crossed the mountains in wagons to Tennessee , Granpa used to tell Pa Frank who told Annie , and the wagons were loaded with furniture and trunks and the white ladies , and the white gentlemen  --  here Granpa and Pa Frank would spit  --  rode on saddle horses , with all the slaves walking , chained neck to neck in a column behind the wagons . And walking barefoot , on frosty ground , for it was earliest spring ; and some women pregnant and all stumbling from exhaustion , bruised and lame from stones and twigs and falling , choking on the iron collar , and the gentlemen  --  spit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new plantation in Tennessee did n't prosper . The slaves were sullen from whippings and starvation , the crops failed  --  no market for indigo , the tobacco wilted immature , the cotton barely boiled . And then one winter Granpa died with the grippe , from no medicines , not even a root doctor ( he was forbidden rigidly by the McNeals ' religion ) , from no heat in the cabins and not  | enough food . To preserve the plantation , they had to auction some of the slaves ; and Pa Frank , who was about seventeen at the time and a strapping boy who 'd bring a good price , was happy when he knew he was among them . The Murchisons , who were going into the newly opened territory in north Mississippi , bought him and on the trip they took an interest in him and asked if he 'd like to be their house boy . That was the funny part ? they asked him ! So when the new house was built , Frank worked inside all the time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a little and when he got married to Lizzie , they gave him a cabin of his own ; and then Annie and all the children were born . But none of them ever learned to read , for the war came on when they were young and then there was nobody with the time and , later on , with the interest , to teach them . There was one incident that Granma Annie told , though , which she could dress up with her own childish recollections . She had witnessed it , but , too young to realize its importance , she heard the details afterward from her Pa Frank . All the slaves had been called to the big house , for Mr. Woodrow Murchison was going away to the war . He stood in his uniform on the porch waiting for them , and the white ladies were beside him and the house servants , Pa Frank and Ma Lizzie and some others , lingered by the door and a boy held his horse at the doorstep . Mr. Woodrow  --  Mr. Woody , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm voice how it was , how he had to go fight the Federal Army that was invading his and others ' lands and rights ; and how he wanted all of them to be loyal to their mistress and to him . When he had said it all , he turned to Pa Frank and said , not so loud that all could hear it at the time , but they all heard it repeated later : " Frank , after I leave , my wife and daughters will be alone , as my son Tom has gone off to fight too , and I have no male relatives here on the place . Can I trust you to see to their safety ? " At that Frank began to tremble . " Mr. Woody , " he said , " I can see to the house an the niggers , but I ai n't prepared to see to white lady folks . " He would have gone on with excuses , but Mr. Woody broke in sharply . " Frank , you are a responsible man . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear to do what I say ? " " Yessuh , Mr. Woody . I cai n't disobey you . "  | " Always stay by Miss Eva and Miss Corinne and my wife , Miss Rose . " Frank could n't speak at first , but Mr. Woody kept looking straight into his eyes till finally he said , " ' Fore God I will , Mr. Woody . " " Then I can go away peaceable in my mind , " said Mr. Woody . And he kissed his family , shook hands with Pa Frank , waved to the other slaves and , mounting his horse , rode away from their weeping . The black side of the Murchison family , like many another , had known respect , then , even though they were slaves , and had felt a sense of dignity . How did it happen that they had forgotten it  --  forgotten the fact that they had it , expected it ? Taffy George knew that some had argued , and probably correctly , that it had sprung from the white man 's guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his slaves . But all knew that in the present time , when the slaves were all freed , the whites felt neither guilt nor respect for them . They felt nothing but amusement ; vexation , scorn , fear , all turned into a protective cloak of humor . To be really funny , maybe you had to be black and not a slave . That would be the incongruity none of the whites could ever understand . If they could n't laugh at you , they 'd have to  --  what ? what else was left them to do to you ? ? kill you , like Granpa Henry and Tobe ? Then why would his own race , whatever the shading of each person , adopt the same reaction , degrade itself , unless from fear of murder , from ignorance or laziness ? Or , as Mr. Silas had told him , from mistaken compliance , from lack of self-respect and lack of leadership outside the white man 's imposed doctrine . He was too young to analyze it , even to understand what Mr. Silas told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , operating doubly against him , as long as he could remember ? " Yella bastud ! " ? and he could sense it swirling inside , now clear , then dark , like clouds of steam pouring across the headlight of a train . Yes , Tobe was in it too ; through him he felt it and the need to understand it , and he knew Mr. Silas could help him . With this resolution of his preoccupation , his thoughts relaxed into a serene rest , through which the monologue of the comedian gradually broke . Taffy George began to hear him again . " . . . tellin you , this mother-in-law is crazy about cookin . She give me two of her favorite dishes all the time  --  hot tongue an  | cold shoulder . An pies too  --  I set my teeth in one of her pies one day , an they 're still there . . .. " After they left the tent at the end of the show , they wormed through the jostling noisy crowd to the road . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Papa and Andrew ? shadowy forms until they passed under the spaced electric bulbs ? and their voices seldom reached them . " Papa , " said Taffy George . " Is it funny to be black ? " " I don know as it is . Why ? " " You ' as all laughin about it . " " Oh , that ' as jus a show , " said Papa . They were coming to a street light and Taffy George lifted his arms before him . " Course , I ai n't as dark as you , but that ? " Papa thrust his arms clown roughly . " Don do that , " he said in a strange voice . " Yo Uncle Lincoln used to do that . " " I don see what 's wrong . " " I don like it . Skin don make no diff'rence . " " Tha 's what I was goin to say . " " Jus don be proud o yo lightness . " " I ai n't . " Taffy George walked on for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Papa  --  you reckon you could make everybody stop callin me Taffy ? " " Maybe . But why ? " " Cause I don like it . It 's sticky an sweet like . " " Tha 's what you are , " said Andrew . " Tha 's what you think . " " We can call you George , " said Papa . " But you 're George . " " Well  --  Junior , then . " " Aw naw ! Something like maybe T.G. That don mean a thing but letters . " " O.K. , then . We 'll start on T.G. Andy , meet T.G. " " How ja do , Miss T. Sticky G. , " simpered Andrew . George had to stop the fight .  | 30 In the dusk of the doctor 's office , relieved only by the light filtering through the front plate glass , which was painted gray almost to the top to shield patients from the street , George watched the examination in angry despair . But he tried to keep any evidence of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give up completely . That would come soon enough , he felt sure ; let her hope while she could . Behind their chairs , beyond the zigzag of cloth screens on rolling metal frames that divided the long room , making the front a reception room and the rear , where they sat , a private treatment room , no one was waiting for consultation . They had come late to avoid young Dr. Murchison 's white patients . The tiny point of light beaming from Doctor Robert 's hand moved over Henry Danny 's blinking left eye . " Yessuh , I can see it a little , " answered the boy . " Kin ' o like a way-off match . " Doctor Robert tested from side to side and then directed the finger of light , almost like an accusation , on the right eye . The pupil , faintly veiled with an opaque deadness , did not stir . " Do you see it now ? " asked the doctor . " No suh . " The finger came closer and shifted from side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boy 's lips draw in between his teeth . For a moment there was no reply . George pretended to ignore May 's worried glance . " I can almost see it , " said Henry Danny slowly , and George knew that even that was a lie . " I think I can , " added the boy . Doctor Robert snapped down the big silver third eye which was strapped about his forehead and leaned close to Henry Danny 's face to study the interior of the pupils . Frequent questions , laconic and , to George , futile , for the answers were already plain , broke the stillness as the doctor continued his examination . May reached out to George and spoke in a quivering whisper ; he pressed her hand and shook his head . Finally Doctor Robert finished and rose to switch on the light  | hanging in a metal shade above them . The white enameled cases with strange instruments and vessels behind the glass doors , and the steel bed with its head cocked up and its foot drooping like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Danny stood up , a hand outstretched , and with three cautious steps crossed to George . The fingers crept along his arm and clasped his hand . It was impossible , the doctor said , to give them any encouragement , since there had been no improvement through the past months . In fact , if anything , there had been a gradual loss of vision even in the left eye . An operation was still the only hope and , as he had told them before , it was too special , too delicate , for him ; it would require a skilled surgeon , a hospital and much expense . He was trying to be gentle and honest , George knew , and in return George tried to control his feelings . " An there 's not any hospital , " he said , " an not enough money . " " That 's almost the way it stacks up , George . It 's not something I can cure with drops and pills . It should have been done months ago when you first knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . And yet it might not . It might have been useless from the first . Now . . . I 'm afraid you 'll  --  just have to reconcile yourselves . " May had begun to sniffle . George felt his son 's grip on his hand tighten , " Try not to be too depressed about it , " the doctor was going on unemotionally . " You 'll have to try to  --  adjust  --  the boy and yourselves . It ca n't be helped now . " George was on his feet , with his shoulders drawn forward as if he meant to lurch into some distasteful object . " It could a been helped , " he broke out angrily , " if they 'd a done what they ought . If they 'd helped us ? " At May 's touch on his sleeve , he realized he had let his control collapse , and after the sudden halt , he said more quietly , " I 'm sorry , Doctor Robert . You did what you could . You were mighty good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They went out onto the street and walked toward Rosson Row . Most of the way , Henry Danny kept a hand lightly on George 's arm , but once in a while , he would remove it and walk as if he saw clearly ahead . But only a few steps , for he would lunge when  | he came to a dip in the walk , or stumble on a jutting brick . Then with injured docility he would reach for guidance . George could not bear to take the boy 's arm ; it would seem to Henry Danny too plain a reminder of his unimpaired sight . But also to George it would recall his failings which in some way were responsible for the damage  --  his failings through ignorance and stupidity and stubbornness  --  the same kind that had so often caused bruises to Taffy George that the boy even now could hardly forget them or forgive him . At first , when Henry Danny had seemed recovered from the blow on his temple , they had supposed the dimness of his vision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drops would improve . Doctor Robert had warned them that the nerves of the eye could have been injured and a specialist might help . But George could n't understand why a black eye , which everyone got over , would seriously harm the boy . He hesitated weeks more , expecting normal sight to return , inquiring of Henry Danny how well he could see ( and knowing now that he had lied ) , until at last there was no hiding the truth . When he called Henry Danny one day , his son had come slowly out on the porch , the groping for a chair barely perceptible , and after he sat down , had turned , though George was in the yard , to the empty swing and said , " What you want , Papa ? " May confessed then that she had noticed for a long time that he saw less and less , but dared not speak for fear of discouraging them . Why would they not know he could go blind from the blow on his temple , not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of recovery ? And why , when they knew the truth , must he delay and debate with himself and others and let their last chances go by just to satisfy his offended sense of justice ? George 's anger , surpassing its former intensity , fed his obstinacy when he discovered how futile it was to expect retribution . When he asked Doctor Robert 's help to collect damages , he was sent to a lawyer to whom he and Henry Danny explained the incident . After the lawyer had investigated , he offered George little hope of winning a suit , and Silas , when George repeated the details to him , agreed sadly . The city officials , the lawyer had said , considered it merely an accident , the result of a fight provoked by Henry Danny ; the local government was n't responsible in any case , and the white men were n't  --  at least in a courtroom they  | would n't be  --  and even if the court awarded a judgment in George 's favor , he could n't collect . " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men say they were attacked , and the jury is going to believe them rather than a nigger boy . " " Take him to Memphis and try to get an operation , " Doctor Robert had urged repeatedly . " They ought to pay for it , " George would reply . " They put his eye out and they got to pay . " " You ca n't force them to , George . Mr. Flagg 's told you you ca n't win a lawsuit . Use your own money . " " We ai n't got that much , I do n't think . " " Your wife 's got enough in the bank to ? " The doctor blushed at revealing his unwarranted knowledge . " Pay it out by the month , " he said gruffly . " They got to pay it , " said George . But his stubborn resolve did not completely wipe out the possibility of following the doctor 's suggestion . George discussed it with May and , though they agreed there was plenty to pay for all expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the drain , since Doctor Robert had not assured them of recovery . Both were frightened by the idea of surgery and when they mentioned it to Henry Danny , he cried , " I don want my eye cut on . Don let em cut me , Pa . " Silas tried vainly to convince the boy that there was a chance through an operation , but in spite of his explanations and tales of success , Henry Danny held firm in his resistance . And his parents , too , were hardly convinced of the wisdom of it . " But you have to try , " argued Silas . " Sure , it 's a gamble ? " " Then le 's gamble with their money , not ours , " said George . " You ought n't to balk at that , when it 's your son 's sight . " " Maybe it could n't be cured nohow . They should jus pay fo damages . " " Money is n't going to make it right , George . . . make it less unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of spite for other injustice . " " There ai n't no hospitals . " " Move to a city , " Silas pled . " Do what you can for him . Do you want him peddling peanuts on a street corner , or pencils and chewing gum ? "  | The picture sprang for the first time into their imaginations and George drew in his breath . " He wo n't ever do that , " he said at last . " We could go , sure , " said May , " but s'pose we did . We go to Memphis an cai n't find a hospital to take us or anybody who 'll operate . Then we move to another city , I guess . And on to another , maybe . " " That might happen , " said Silas . " But there 's other things , too . You could get a little higher pay , have a nicer house maybe , have more things to do , a better life . It 's not just you I 'm thinking of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially Taffy George  --  T.G. , I mean . He 'll be graduating in another year and he wants to go to college . " " What good 'll that do ? " asked George . " Any way we improve does some good . T.G. could do a lot , I think , if he had the chance . I 've talked to him dozens of times and I know what 's in him . In a city you 'd give him a chance of college and Henry Danny a chance of eyesight . " " They cai n't save his eyes now . What 's done is done . " " You accept everything  --  the worst , " said Silas gently ; " and you wo n't even believe in , much less hope for , anything better . " With a grimace of shame , George lowered his eyes and he knew in the silence that May was watching him . Then she spoke . " Miss Annie would n't go . " " If she wo n't she can move in with Miss Martha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , too . I 'll hate to see you go , because I do n't have many close friends here  --  I 'm outside the lives of most , except the children , and they 're scared of me or make fun of me . A few , like T.G . . . But you 'll come back to visit , or I 'll come to see you . " " We ai n't gone yet , Silas , " said May with a smile . " No , not yet , " he answered , laughing lightly . During the succeeding months Silas frequently referred to the idea of their moving away , and expanded his picture of the opportunities a larger town would offer . When George discussed it with T.G. , the boy 's reticence annoyed him secretly , for he had depended somewhat on the desire for college to be the decisive force in their leaving . " I guess you 'll need all the money to fix Henry Danny 's eyes , " T.G. said . " You ca n't afford to send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort o job . Mr. Haworth down at the hotel promised to let me bellhop this summer . I could keep on . " You got another year o school , " said George in frustration . " Well ... " Chafing under the responsibility of choice , George turned again to his only confidant now that Tobe was dead . With Silas he sat on the porch in Possum Hollow , behind the frail latticework up which tendrils of hop vines were beginning to creep , and while the full moon sank down the sky , watched its glint on the trees and roofs above the rows of dull-glowing doors across the alley . When he brought up the subject of college and described T.G. 's reactions , he was met with faint amusement . " He do n't talk that way to me , " Silas commented at last . " Do you want him to go to college ? " " If he wants to . " " But do you want him to ? " George looked morosely at his hands . He could imagine T.G. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting like them . . . he saw him looking down on his family , embarrassed by their ignorance and crude manners , flashing among his inferiors as Lincoln , even without education , did . . . and he knew , because T.G. ? taffy-pale  --  would take all the money they 'd give and despise them for it , just as George years ago used to fear he would , so that Andrew would do without and Henry Danny would stay blind , that this must somehow be the ultimate joke on him  --  to make him insist that T.G. do it all . He raised his head resolutely . Through the dimness he could distinguish a faint smile on Silas ' lips . With the moon shadows from the lattice barring the face , George thought of his father looking out from the prison cell with the same quiet smile he had sensed on those lips when at the back doorstep they said , " Yeah , " to his childhood through the dark night after surrendering the marble , and then of his memory of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking Why did you teach me that ? To teach my sons when they grow up ? You knew it was wrong , Pa  --  the white man 's trap  --  and it killed you . Why did n't you teach me how to escape ? Then was it the smile of secret strength which he had bestowed on T.G. , as neatly as a white man could on a black , that now aroused his objections ? Was he  | afraid the boy would walk deeper into or farther out of the trap ? All the time granting that T.G. was not like Lincoln in his nature , George , with a sickening twinge at the image of the boy lynched , knew that he had blindly staked all his amorphous hopes on him , and after years of striving in atonement for his trust and affection , ever so little by little winning a part of them , had come to feel for him a love that went beyond family , for there was no blood tie , but was deeper than if there had been . For Silas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a smile that touched delicately to remind of all that had been said and experienced , a smile that begged you to help yourself out of your knowledge , a smile that encouraged , like a father cheering on his child 's first steps . " That 's one way we grow , I guess , " he seemed to hear Silas saying ; " . . . a lot to hold up for their respect .. . others , maybe sooner because of Tobe . . . " But actually Silas had merely repeated his question . " Yes , " answered George , " I want im to go . " " That 's something he does n't know , " said Silas . " He 'd have gone anyway , I 'm sure . He 'd have worked his way through college . He did n't want to ask if you 'd help him . " " I want im to go , " George said once more , and forcefully . " He 's the only one of em could do it . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were all sitting in the front room to listen to T.G. read aloud for Henry Danny . It had become their custom to follow the stories after one and then another , listening casually , had found them absorbing , and by now T.G. had gone through almost half the small shelf of books , reading whatever Andrew or Henry Danny chose . Even Aunt Martha joined them occasionally , if she happened in at the beginning of an adventure , and she chafed at being lured away from her " boarder . " George had noticed lately that T.G. no longer offered to read just for Henry Danny , as he did after the accident occurred . A dim cloud of annoyance would cross the boy 's face at such a request . Even when another of the family  --  himself or May  --  asked T.G. to continue a novel , he frequently would say he had to go somewhere . " I got a date , " he said sometimes , and sometimes emphasized his luck even more , if Henry Danny was present , by adding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say merely that he  | was going to the movies . No one tried to hamper his freedom , least of all George , though he often gave him a look of disapproval ; but since T.G. was working for the hotel through the summer and had his own money , he came and went as he pleased . These days , Henry Danny did n't ask to be read to at all , and someone else , half out of sympathy for his loneliness and half out of selfish interest in the book , would have to suggest it . How else could the boy be entertained ? With the small radio George had bought for him , Henry Danny listened so constantly to ball games , jazz , serial stories and commercials during the day that May and Annie sometimes nearly went out of their minds . " They make so much racket I cai n't think , " Annie complained . " Why they talk so much ? Like a bunch o bullfrogs fo a rain . " George begged Andrew to bring some girl friends over for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you some ice cream an cake , or Cokes , or something , " he offered . But Andrew told him after making a first invitation that it would n't work . " They all like to hang out at the Dipsy-Doodle Cafe , " he said sullenly . George realized from his son 's injured expression that that was n't the entire reason , and at length by pressing questions at the boy he heard it . " They say they don want no truck with a blind fellow . " When George asked some days later , " Could n't you take im to the Dipsy-Doodle some night ? " he saw in Andy 's eyes what Andy must have seen in the girls ' faces . " He could n't have no fun there noway , " was Andy 's excuse . " He 'd jus be in the way . " Nothing , then , for Henry Danny to do but listen  --  listen to the radio , T.G. 's reading , their talk , for years and years . And now he was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels the rest of them liked ; he 'd break in , saying , " Shut up that crap an le 's listen to some jazz . " When T.G. had finished the chapter in The Trail of the Lonesome Pine , Henry Danny sighed , " Hallelujah ! " and scraped his chair toward the radio . His hands fumbled to the knobs and after waiting for the tubes to warm up , he began a sampling of programs . " Get some real hot stuff , " said Andrew , as he moved to sit near him . " Why , tha 's a real sweet story , " said Aunt Martha reprovingly . " Le 's go on the porch where it 's cool , " suggested May . " We 'll hear the music loud enough anyway . "  | " Ai n't you got a get back to yo bo'der ? " asked Annie , with a teasing lilt , when they had settled outside in the fresh air . " Uh . . . he 's gone off tonight to a club meetin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , a sudden welcome breeze , laden with a scent of honeysuckle and rain , brushed over them , and they speculated on prospects of a storm to break the heat . " Never rains at night in June , " quoted Annie . A high-piled cloud , blue-black in the night sky to the east , seemed to belie her wisdom . Tentacles of lightning darted from its heart at times , and the sheeted glow of internal explosions revealed the bulging masses of the huge shape , but no thunder could be heard . The breeze kept coming , but the cloud seemed hardly to move nearer or to change in form . " T.G. , " said George , after a deep breath , " I done decided I think you ought a go to college . " " Lawsy mercy , " said Martha before he could answer , " you ai n't harkin back to movin away , is you ? " " I 've put my mind to it time an again , " said George , " an I think it 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Silas ! " snorted Martha . " I ai n't gon na budge from here , " said Annie . " All my loved ones is buried here an I ai n't goin away . " " What earthly good is it fo that chile to fill is head with all sorts o book learnin ? " asked Martha . " If he did n't have some , " said May , " you could n't a enjoyed hearin im read tonight . " " I 'd like fo im to be somebody , " said George , " if he wants to . I want im to be somethin more'n a bellboy or a ditch digger . " " Somebody like pore ole Omnes Gallia Jones , I guess , " said Aunt Martha , with a confusion of wistful memory and scornful opinion . " Pokin aroun in white folks ' garbage cans fo rags an papers to sell , an runnin his nose long ev'y ditch in town lookin fo money , an draggin ev'y ole dead mule or hoss or cow off behin the dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yo beau , " chuckled Annie . " He was fine enough then . " " He used to work in the shops too , " said George . " But he cai n't no mo now , cause o that broke shoulder that growed whopsided . I mean somebody like Silas . "
