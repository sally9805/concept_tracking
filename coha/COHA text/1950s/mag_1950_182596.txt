For 13 years , Manhattan 's Whitney Museum has greeted spring with a big show of contemporary U.S. sculpture , watercolors and drawings . Last week 's exhibition was one of the best in the show 's history . As usual , it contained a weedy jungle of mediocre and ostentatious works , and nothing that could be called " great . " But down among the weeds were many fresh , playful sprouts . <P> None of the younger men 's watercolors could match those exhibited by oldtimers Charles Burchfield and John Marin , but there were a few that came close . Dong Kingman 's rich , elaborate House Boat , an artful jumble of calligraphs set in perspective , was lively and bright as a flag-draped avenue on a windy day . Lawrence Kupferman 's luminous underwater abstraction , Genesis of Growth , had all the minute fascination of a rocky tide pool . <P> David Fredenthal 's Great Fugue was a rhythmic evocation of Conductor Arturo Toscanini in action , and of the music he draws forth . Fredenthal had spent hours in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct orchestra rehearsals . Toscanini moved too fast to catch in an orthodox sketch , so Fredenthal made multiple-image sketches that recorded a number of recurrent gestures simultaneously . The resulting watercolor bore some relation to Marcel Duchamp 's famed Nude Descending a Staircase and some to Gjon Mili 's stroboscopic photographs . It had more warmth than either . <P> In sculpture , warmth is less easily achieved . The Greeks did it consistently , but few moderns care to try . Among the few is Burr Miller , whose marble Genetrix stood out at the Whitney like a breathing woman in a waxworks . Robert Cronbach 's bas-relief Woman Drinking was contrastingly weightless ; by hollowing out his fat , unhappy figure he had transformed her into an alcoholic cloud . <P> Most of the sculptures selected by the Whitney were abstract concoctions of spikes , bumps , lumps , bars and bits of string , and most were dreadful . But Robert Howard 's slim pear wood Semaphore was there to show how elegant three-dimensional abstractions can be . Peter Lipman-Wulf 's Horse and Man looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carpenter 's scrap barrel . Despite its casual air it was as tense and tightly constructed as anything in the show .
