txt In refutation of Soviet charges that the Paris agreements increase the danger of war , the Western Powers have taken two more steps which should puncture a lot of Soviet propaganda balloons . They are completing the text of a new note rejecting the " childish and unrealistic " Soviet proposal for an immediate ' all-European " security " conference as being merely a device to bury these agreements and to divide the West rather than to solve East-West problems . At the same time , through Premier MendesFrance , who spoke in obvious agreement with Washington , they have suggested a new Four-Power conference to be held in Paris next ' May , after the Paris agreements are ratified and put into force . The first step is another demonstration that the Western Powers see through the Soviet wrecking maneuvers . The second provides further proof that they are ready to negotiate whenever there is a good chance of positive results . Far from closing the door to negotiations , the Paris agreements are intended to open it . For the primary purpose of the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength for successful negotiation . This strength will not be great enough to wage a war of " aggression , " as the Soviets profess to fear . On the contrary , as President Eisenhower has pointed out and as M. Mendes-France repeated yesterday , the Paris agreements provide the first real arms limitation and control system and the West would be pleased if the Soviets should adopt a like system fir their own power bloc . But the West does propose to build enough strength for self-defense , in order to assure its own security and to prevent a Soviet war of aggression . On this basis it can undertake negotiations with the Soviets with better chances of success . The proposal of a new Big Four conference is in keeping with M. Mendes-France 's previous suggestions for " parallel " negotiations with the Soviets while the Paris agreements are pub into effect . It is also in line with Chancellor Adenauer 's declaration that such a conference , after the Paris agreements are put into force , is an " urgent necessity , " in order to explore both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractual security guarantees for East and West , Washington and London put first emphasis on the ratification of the Paris agreements , but once these stand they are pledged to seek a new understanding with the Soviets . It goes without saying , however , that such a conference must be adequately prepared , and that the Soviets must show their desire to negotiate in good faith . This point , long stressed by President Eisenhower , is also emphasized by M. Mendes-France , who urges the Soviets to sign the Austrian independence treaty as proof of their intentions . The other test , on which the West must and will insist , of course , is Soviet agreement to free elections throughout Germany as the only possible basis for German unification ' and an all-German Government . Only such a German Government could negotiate an enduring peace settlement . The West will have to insist upon such a Government all the more forcefully because that Government will also have the right to assume or not to assume the obligations of the Paris pacts.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
