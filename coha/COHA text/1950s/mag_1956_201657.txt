An outfit called the National Hell 's Canyon Association , Inc. blossomed and bristled like a desert cactus last year , soon after the Federal Power Commission turned down an eight-year-old proposal that the Government build a single high dam in Idaho 's Hell 's Canyon , instead licensed a private utility to build three small dams in the area ( TIME , Aug. 15 , 1955 ) . Turning furiously to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington , the association charged that the FPC action amounted to " administrative lawlessness " and de manded that the court order the license revoked . Chief argument : under the terms of the Federal Power Act . the FPC was required to choose a project " best adapted to a comprehensive plan " for public-resource development . Declared the association : a federal high dam would meet that requirement , the Idaho Power Co. ' s private project does not . <P> Last week the court gave its answer : " We find no instance in which the com mission violated the governing statute " - which gives it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to the nation 's needs . Before exer cising this discretion , said the court , the FPC gave " mature consideration " to both plans and concluded-on the basis of the evidence-that each was " equally comprehensive . " Weighing in favor of the private project was the fact that Congress has consistently refused to authorize a federal dam . Hence , the FPC " chose between a $400 million plan , which nobody was offering to undertake , and another comprehensive development for which private capital in the sum of $175 million is immediately available , so construction can begin at once . " Concluded the court : the FPC 's right to make such a choice is legally unassailable .
