Winter winds whistle through Auckland , New Zealand at this time of the year , but even New Zealand 's chilly days are not enough to winterkill the dreams of freedom that bloom eternally in the hearts of men and monkeys . Three weeks ago , despite the weather , six bonnet monkeys decided to give up the comforts of a warm cage in the Auckland Zoo and take up residence in a pine grove just down West View Road . Zoo authorities tried in vain to lure them back , but the free souls in the pine trees only mocked their efforts . <P> In time most of the children of Auckland took up the monkeys ' cause , and the local fruit dealer did a land-office business as moppets flocked around to buy bananas . Mingling freely with all who came offering food and genuine friendship , the monkeys would eat their bananas with relish , and then , with unerring aim and discernment , shy their skins at whatever furtive zoo keeper chanced to be lurking near by . At last , frustrated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plate of rum-soaked food standing near , to tempt the refugees . One poor , pusillanimous monkey fell for the dodge , and as the keepers dragged him off drunk and disorderly in a sack , the other monkeys took to the trees and aired their disapproval in derisive jeers . <P> At the end of two weeks , two more foolish monkeys were caught-one by following strategically placed bits of orange peel straight into the mouth of a zoo keeper 's sack-but the three remaining holdouts had grown shrewder than ever . In the end , it was only the perversity of fate and their common simianity that brought them down . One day last week , unused to the perils that abound in freedom , one of the monkeys was hit by a passing automobile . As he lay in the road , stunned but unhurt , a lurking keeper took him captive . <P> Racing to the rescue and rendered careless by the fate that had overtaken their friend , his two comrades ran straight into the arms of the law .
