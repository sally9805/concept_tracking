From Here to Eternity ( Columbia ) . Making novels into movies-turning the rambling equations of a story into the compact formula of drama-is a task perhaps fitter for some electronic calculating monster than for any human talent . That may explain why Hollywood , whose talent is all too human , has never developed a sure touch in these translations . Columbia 's success in bringing James Jones 's bestselling novel to the screen may be due partly to the fact that it was hardly a novel at all ; it was an obscene , extravagant blot of ink , pressed between covers into something like a literary Rorschach sample . Every reader saw in it something different , but most agreed that it contained a tremendously vivid and exciting picture of men in the mass , and added , up to as powerful an expression of love-hate for the U.S. Army as had ever been published . <P> Scriptwriter Daniel Taradash rescued , if not quite a gem , then at least a high-grade industrial diamond from this rough original ; and Director Fred Zinnemann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has polished the diamond till it cuts . In the refinement , it is true , something has been lost : the bloody but beautiful amateur standing of it all . There are touches of slick sentimentality that do not seem to come vignettes that had to be shorn away . But no one will miss the book 's wealth of pointless profanity . Through its chill professional eye , the camera sees the persons of the drama more clearly than Jones did , and still does not wear too yellow a filter when it looks-far less bitterly than the book-at the " Pineapple Army " of 1941 . <P> The screenplay focuses more sharply than the novel did on Private Robert E. Lee ( " Prew " ) Prewitt , the " hardhead " who can " soldier with any man , " the 30-year man who can not play it smart because he is cursed with a piece of ultimate wisdom . As he puts it , " If a man do n't go his own way , he 's nothin ' . " <P> Transferred into Company G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Captain Dana ( " Dynamite " ) Holmes that he can not go his own way . Captain Holmes , a boxing fanatic who wants his company to win the regimental championship , knows that Prew is a first-class middleweight , and insists that he box for his new outfit . Prew , who quit fighting after he blinded a friend with a " no more'n ordinary right cross , " refuses . Furious , Holmes orders his non-coms-all of whom are on the boxing team-to give Prew " the treatment . " <P> Prew takes it without a word for months on end . They trip him in bayonet drill , cheat him in rifle inspection , and for every fault they find , Prew has to pay with K.P. , extra laps around the track under full pack , or hours of digging enormous holes in the ground so that jeering noncoms can bury a single newspaper . ( In the movie , Captain Holmes is forced to resign for his actions ; in the book , he was promoted. )        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
