When Upton Sinclair was living in Mary McDowell 's stockyards settlement house in Chicago and raking up the muck for his novel The Jungle , a trim little ( 5 ft. 4 in. ) woman doctor named Alice Hamilton was living only five miles away in Hull House . Indiana-bred , raised in ease , and educated at Miss Porter 's famed school at Farmington , Conn. , Alice Hamilton was working at the turn of the century as a bacteriologist by day but did settlement work by night and on weekends . Thus she met countless victims of industrial hazards and eventually became the founder of industrial medicine in the U.S. <P> When Dr. Hamilton started out , the A.M.A. had never held a meeting on industrial medicine , and technical papers on it by U.S. doctors were rare ( though European work on it filled volumes ) . There were safeguards of sorts against physical accidents , but for a workman who spent years absorbing a slow but deadly poison , there was little thought . Dr. Hamilton had heard of men choked by carbon monoxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead poisoning , of others disabled by arsenic and cyanides , of men with the " bends . " To Alice Hamilton 's socialist conscience , all this was outrageous . <P> Down the Mines . In 1910 she got her chance to do something about it : Illinois ' Governor Charles Deneen appointed her to a state commission to investigate " occupational diseases . " Her commission did not know where to begin because there was not even an official list of dangerous occupations , so Dr. Hamilton compiled it as she went from factory to factory . She could not demand admittance , but most managers let her in . The woman doctor brashly invaded the man 's world , plowed through unventilated , fume-filled plant after plant . She took air samples , studied the ubiquitous dusts , noted how men did their jobs . <P> Before the Illinois work was finished , the Federal Government asked Dr. Hamilton to do a similar job . This kept her roving through mine , mill and smelter for a dozen years . She combatted the effects of such anciently known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a frequent cause of brain damage ( hence , some say , the expression " mad as a hatter " ) . And she fought ultramodern lethal concoctions-TNT , aniline dyes , picric acid , which stained its workers so yellow that they were dubbed " canaries . " She campaigned for ventilation , antitoxic rinses , safeguards of all kinds . <P> Back to Boston . Spinster Hamilton , long devoted to the causes of woman suffrage and of birth control for the masses , once bitterly chided Boston for opposing woman suffrage longer than Chicago , women doctors longer than New Orleans . But it was from Harvard 's medical faculty that she got her greatest honor : as early as 1919 Harvard named her assistant professor in industrial medicine . Crusader Hamilton saw U.S. industry increasingly accept the fact that its workers ' health was inseparable from an evergrowing productivity , saw her field broadened beyond the now obvious hazards of poison to include psychological hazards as well . <P>                  @ @ @
