Following her recent trip to England , a British look at Mrs. Richard M. Nixon appeared in the December 5 issue of The Spectator , published in London . It is re ? printed below , by permission of The Spectator , which titled the piece about the wife of America 's Vice Presi ? dent , " Mrs. Pat . " A POLICEMAN stopped each taxi at the gate and stuck LI- his head in to look at the occupant . It was an in ? teresting prelude to going to tea with Mrs. Nixon . Then the Ambassador 's black front door glided open ( neither knock nor ring was required , merely presence ) and a glittering young man inside said " Ma'am ? " and dis ? creetly mentioned where the cloakroom was . " They 've already gone into conclave , " he rebuked , as I sidled 10 minutes late into the Gold Dining Room . Inside , sure enough , Mrs. Pat was presiding over a silver tea-tray beneath a chandelier . She perpetually poured tea out of an antique china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes one of them would say , " Mrs. Nixon , would you mind pouring tea again ? " She smiled widely and obligingly heaved the tea-pot up . The tea , handed to one in a gold-encrusted cup , tasted to me like old shoes , though an epicure identified it as Java Smoked . The cakes , on the other hand , were better than the native English ever lay hands on ? baby eclairs and teeny cream buns filled with real cream . The dining-room was shimmering gold with dainty arrangements of Cape gooseberries upon the walls and there was a rare polish on the long table . The house , so one of the reception party told me , was full of " little things the C'hitneys left behind " though I could not find out what , iny of these were , unless one was the van Gogh in the next room Mrs. Pat . face to face , is like a Republican Coppelia . She chatters. answers questions , smiles and smiles , all with a doll 's terrifying poise . There is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smiling while the world broke . Only her eyes , dark , darting and strained . signal that inside the black suit and pearls there is a human being , probably perfectly content not to get out . " Do you worry about politics , Mrs. Nixon ? " " Oh no , I never worry . " " Do you mind the rude things people have said about your husband , Mrs. Nixon ? " " Oh no , when you really know what a person is like inside them you do n't let unkind comments affect you . " " Do you find your political duties affect your family life , Mrs. Nixon ? " " Oh no , I reserve time to be with the children every day . " Britain was beautiful , just too beautiful , that was for sure . Such a pity there was no time to see everything , all the wonderful places she was always reading about . She just loved people . She was like that . She loved en ? tertaining , too . Mostly when she dined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing Spanish-style cooking for her friends . No , she did n't live in an official residence . Just a house . The married couple who ran it had two whole days off a week and Mrs. Nixon pitched in and did everything herself . How did British women compare for dress with American women ? Mrs. Pat looked round the dowdy assembly of women reporters and said tactfully that they looked exactly like their American counterparts . Most of Mrs. Pat 's clothes came from the Elizabeth Arden Dress Shop and she always chose Richard 's neckties . She was giving him ties for Christmas . Yes , she had been very disappointed at the trend of the recent elec ? tions . She herself , it was true , had once been a Demo ? crat , but love had changed all that . And the Republican Party had changed too . Did she ever feel frightened at her reputation for being the perfect politician 's wife ? " Oh no , I just travel along from day to day doing the best I can . " And such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , one hint of fear , one golden tea-cup over ? turned on the Persian carpet and one could have loved her . critics could argue , the Soviet Union creeps backward . But even more upsetting to the Soviet elder brothers must be the Chinese claim that their communes herald the imminent advent of Communism , that is , the final coming of that historical development in which the principle of " to each according to his needs " will prevail . In words almost identical with the thesis published in Russia on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution , the Chinese Party announces that " the realization of Communism in our country is no long ? er something remote . " This must surely seem a travesty of Marxism to the Kremlin . For how can an economi ? cally and culturally backward country like China , lacking the material abundance and level of literacy necessary to sustain a mature Communist society , claim it has reached or is about to reach the " highest stage of history .
