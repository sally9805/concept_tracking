The Caribbean 's other dictator-turned-tourist , Venezuela 's Marcos Prez Jimnez , turned up last week in an air-conditioned suite in Manhattan 's Hotel Pierre , blandly told reporters he was only trying to beat the heat of Miami Beach , where he lives . He is also trying to beat what the U.S. State Department calls " very good " chances of deporting him-and he has talented help . His attorney is Miamian David W. Walters , who performed a similar service for Cuban ex-President Carlos Prio Socarrs . Grinned Walters last week : " Prio stayed seven years and went back to Cuba voluntarily before we had exhausted anywhere near all the possibilities . "
