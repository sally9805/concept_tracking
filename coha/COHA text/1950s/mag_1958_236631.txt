In five years as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia , Garfield Todd became a symbol and something of a saint to the 2,220,000 Africans who comprise 92% of the population . More than any other white leader in the Central African Federation ( the united British territories of Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland ) , Todd fought to advance the rights of black men . He tried to give the vote to more Africans , to increase Africans ' wages . But in his zeal for racial " partnership , " Garfield Todd , longtime Churches of Christ ( Disciples ) missionary , gradually antagonized more and more of Southern Rhodesia 's 175,800 whites . Last month his own Cabinet resigned in protest and demanded that Todd himself quit ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) . Africans warned it would be a " sad day " if Todd went . Last week the sad day had come ; Todd had been ousted as leader of the Southern Rhodesian division of the United Federal Party , forcing his resignation as Prime Minister . <P> In up-to-date Salisbury ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a tense congress of the party that ground on for eleven hours , Todd 's critics put their case : in the elections scheduled later this year , Todd would be a liability in the battle against the white-supremacy Dominion Party . For 1 hours Todd spoke in his own defense , and on the first ballot to determine a party leader , Todd topped the poll . The leader of the reactionary faction , Sir Patrick Fletcher , was eliminated from the race . But on the next ballot Todd mustered only 129 votes to 193 for a compromise candidate , Sir Edgar Whitehead , 53 , the Federation 's minister in Washington . <P> A shy bachelor farmer and former Finance Minister with an IBM-like memory , Whitehead was hailed by the party 's moderates as a sounder man , whose advocacy of racial partnership was hard-headedly based on economic necessity rather than evangelizing zeal . The Africans were not reassured . Declared George Nyandoro , secretary-general of the African National Congress in Southern Rhodesia : " Whitehead is a status quo man . A government led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The Africans will have to do the forcing . " <P> The one man who could have saved Todd did not lift a finger on his behalf-Sir Roy Welensky , the burly Prime Minister of the Federation and overall leader of the United Federal Party . Welensky is worried about his party 's electoral chances if the opposition tars it with the label of " liberal . " He was also determined to leave the Southern Rhodesians to their own struggles . As Whitehead patched together a new Cabinet that included Todd , and neatly balanced the party 's opposing factions , Welensky was off on a vacation .
