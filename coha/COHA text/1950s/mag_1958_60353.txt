Uruguay was bulging at the seams when a Regency Club bridge team , representing the U.S. , arrived there to play in the first Pan-American championships at Punta del Este , beginning on Washington 's Birthday , February 22. // Americans found a warm friend at court in the person of Miguel Paez Vilar ? of Montevideo , proprietor of a chain of movie theaters and the self-appointed unofficial good-will agent of the Uruguayan people . A bridge player of some stature himself , he has done much to promote the sport in Uruguay  --  where , according to him , it has increased at least tenfold in the past two years . Expressing himself very cordially on the subject of my teammates , Paez Vilar ? felt that the tournament made an important contribution in the field of good will , since the U.S. team , he said , was comprised of men so eminently suitable for the promotion of friendly relations between the U.S. and South American countries . He referred , of course , not only to the conduct of the individual players , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our team included Boris Koytchou , a former French champion , Constantin Platsis , shipping magnate and former ace in the Greek air force , and Ivan Wichfeld , a native of Denmark . Only half our U.S. team was native-born : Peter Leventritt ( who with Koytchou was a member of my 1957 international team ) , Wingate Bixby , president of the Regency Club , and , of course , your reporter . // The local press was quite generous in its allotment of editorial space to the bridge championship , particularly since we dovetailed with the European Film Festival . Our final round was played amidst the arrival of movie-star delegations from France , Germany and Italy , who shared our headquarters at the beautiful Cantegril Country Club of Punta del Este . // There were five teams opposing us  --  one each from Argentina , Brazil and Chile and two from Uruguay . In a round-robin series of contests the U.S. team succeeded in winning all of its matches to take the undisputed championship of the Pan-American Union . The title , however , was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentine team that was very much still in the running . // At the start of the tournament the Argentines were regarded as co-favorites . Many observers rated their lineup of Alejandro Castro , Alberto Blousson , Hector Kramer , Luis A. Schenone , Alfredo Saravia and Carlos Ottolenghi as more impressive than the team which had just returned from playing against Italy and the United States in the World Championship . Two of Argentina 's strongest players , Kramer and Schenone , due to illness had been unable to play in the World Championship in Italy . // An Argentine victory in the final match would have thrown the tournament into a tie . However , the U.S. team finished strongly , in a match consisting of 60 deals and won by a margin which is roughly equivalent to 4,500 points . // The first of two crucial hands from this final match is the one presented below : // North and South vulnerable East dealer // NORTH // 8 of Spades 3 of Spades 7 of Hearts Jack of Clubs 6 of Clubs 3 of Clubs Queen of Diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Diamonds 4 of Diamonds 3 of Diamonds // WEST // 9 of Spades 5 of Spades 4 of Spades Jack of Hearts 9 of Hearts 8 of Hearts 4 of Hearts 3 of Hearts 2 of Hearts 10 of Clubs 7 of Clubs King of Diamonds 5 of Diamonds // SOUTH // Ace of Spades King of Spades Queen of Spades 2 of Spades Ace of Hearts 10 of Hearts 6 of Hearts Ace of Clubs 9 of Clubs Ace of Diamonds 8 of Diamonds 6 of Diamonds 2 of Diamonds // EAST // Jack of Spades 10 of Spades 7 of Spades 6 of Spades King of Hearts Queen of Hearts 5 of Hearts King of Clubs Queen of Clubs 8 of Clubs 5 of Clubs 4 of Clubs 2 of Clubs // EAST ( Kramer ) // 1 Spade PASS PASS PASS PASS // SOUTH ( Goren ) // DOUBLE 2 NO TRUMP 3 NO TRUMP 6 Diamond // WEST ( Castro ) // PASS PASS PASS PASS // NORTH ( Leventritt ) // 2 Diamond 3 Diamond 5 Diamond PASS // East opened the play with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became declarer at a contract of six diamonds . The bidding may appear to be a little exotic , particularly East 's opening bid of one spade . This Argentine pair were experimenting with the Italian method which ruled out a club opening , for in their system such a bid designates a hand containing at least 17 points in high cards . East therefore chose to open with his rather emaciated holding in spades . Your reporter held the South hand and felt that East was trying to engineer a bit of highway robbery . It was close point whether or not to make an immediate cue bid , but the ultimate decision was in favor of a take-out double . // Leventritt dutifully bid two diamonds , and your reporter restrained himself with a bid of two no trump , feeling that no stronger bid was acceptable if it turned out that North had nothing . North did not take kindly to the no-trump bid and went on to three diamonds , hoping that partner would subside . I was in no mood to give up and , trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trump . Leventritt then decided to contract for game in diamonds , and , inspired by the holding of four aces , your correspondent went on to six diamonds . // An opening lead of the king of clubs would have scuttled the ship , but there is no fault to be found in East 's choice of the king of hearts . This was won with the ace , and a heart was ruffed in the North hand , and the queen of diamonds led . When East showed out Leventritt went up with the ace of diamonds and trumped the remaining heart . A diamond placed the lead with West , and the 10 of clubs came back . This was won with the ace and , as Leventritt ran all his diamonds , East found it impossible to hold on to his club trick and also protect dummy 's spades . // The score recorded for the Americans was 1,370 points and represented an enormous swing , inasmuch as the Argentine North-South pair in the other room played the hand at three no trump , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A heart opening by West established the suit at once , and the king of diamonds afforded West a sure re-entry to cash the balance of the heart suit for a two-trick set and another 200 points for the U.S. // In the next deal , a daring defensive play by Boris Koytchou defeated what appeared to be an invincible game contract and further increased the U.S. score . // North , holding only 12 points and an evenly balanced hand , elected to pass . South 's bid of one spade in third position is acceptable procedure and , though North 's jump to four spades with only three trumps is somewhat irregular , the final contract of four spades is irreproachable. // The king of hearts was opened and ruffed by declarer . When the spade finesse lost to East , a heart came back , and declarer chose to discard one of his losing clubs to avoid being forced too early . West won and led a third round of hearts which South ruffed . Declarer then led a trump to the ace and led the 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tremor , Koytchou played low despite his doubleton . The finesse was repeated , of course , and West won . Now Koytchou led a fourth round of hearts , putting declarer out of business . If he ruffed in the closed hand , West 's 9 of spades would become established ; if he ruffed with North 's low spade he would have no way of exiting from dummy without permitting West 's spade to score . // Now for a holiday from bridge I shall take myself to Buenos Aires , where just 10 years ago I made my first South American bridge tour , with two of my current teammates , Peter Leventritt and Wingate Bixby . During that trip we became friends with Alejandro Castro , then ( as now ) the Argentine bridge captain . Then back to " winter in March " for the spring national championships in Atlantic City , climaxed by the Vanderbilt Team of Four event that will help to decide next year 's World Championship entry .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
