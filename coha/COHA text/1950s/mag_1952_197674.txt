The record companies are doing their best to make it a grand-opera Christmas . With Victor , Columbia and Cetra-Soria setting the pace , the industry has released more than half a dozen full-length operas , nearly a score of recorded excerpts . Among the most important : <P> Mozart : Cosi Fan Tutte ( Eleanor Steber , Blanche Thebom , Richard Tucker , Frank Guarrera ; Metropolitan Opera Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Fritz Stiedry ; Columbia ) . One of the frothiest librettos in opera , in English adaptation , and clean-cut performances of some of Mozart 's most winning tunes . The " official " Met version. * <P> Puccini : La Bohme ( Rosanna Carteri , Ferruccio Tagliavini , Giuseppe Taddei ; Chorus and Orchestra of Radio Italiana , Turin , conducted by Gabriele Santini ; Cetra-Soria ) . The singers give an appealing account of life in their drafty garret , but are vocally outclassed by others who have recorded the popular opera . <P> Menotti : Amahl and the Night Visitors ( Rosemary Kuhlmann , Andrew McKinley , David Aiken , Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Schippers ; Victor ) . Menotti 's 1951 Christmas story with the original NBC-TV cast , Menotti 's easygoing melodies , and the soprano voice of twelve-year-old Chet Allen . <P> Verdi : II Trovatore ( Zinka Milanov , Fedora Barbieri , Jussi Bjoerling , Leonard Warren ; RCA Victor Orchestra and Robert Shaw Chorale conducted by Renato Cellini ; Victor ) . Some of the Metropolitan 's stars in an " unofficial " version ( the Met 's contract is with Columbia ) . This one is notable for a magnificent recording job , the singing of Soprano Milanov , and some rousing choruses , including the Anvil . <P> Other new records : <P> Willy Burkhard : Toccata , Op. 86 ( collegium Musicum , Zurich , conducted by Paul Sacher ; London ) . One of Switzerland 's leading composers turns in a score that combines imagination with some down-to-earth counterpoint . Strings predominate , but winds and percussion give striking punctuation . <P> Beethoven : Piano Concerto No. 3 ( Benno Moiseiwitsch ; Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent ; Victor ) . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's answer to the increasingly successful cut-rate labels . There are no program notes , but the performance is excellent , and there is little sacrifice in the quality of recorded sound . <P> Busoni : Sonata No. 2 ( Richard Burgin , violin ; Edward Weiss , piano ; Circle ) . A massive and powerful work that seems younger than its 53 years . It is free of the flowery passage work of Busoni 's famous piano transcriptions , but never dissonant in the modern sense . It is excellently performed by the Boston Symphony 's concertmaster and a pupil of the composer . <P> Dancers of Bali Gamelan Orchestra ( Columbia ) . Deep gongs , cymbals , gangsas ( marimbas ) , reyongs ( small tuned gongs ) , angklungs ( rattles ) and finger-drums , played with astonishing variety of tone and precisely stumbling rhythms by the Indonesian musicians now touring the U.S. ( TiME , Oct. 6 ) . Good fun , and a rattling good test for " hifi " phonographs . <P> Mozart : Sonata in B Flat , K. 570 ( Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a reconstructed 18th century piano . Kirkpatrick coaxes fine-grained inflections out of the instrument 's wiry pianissimos , makes its loud notes sound almost like those of a solid modern piano .
