The week 's 3-D pictures concentrated on the photogenic West . <P> Inferno ( 20th Century-Fox ) . Robert Ryan , a young man about as rich as they come and as worthless as they go , is junketing in the great American Desert , along with his wife ( Rhonda Fleming ) and the man she secretly loves ( William Lundigan ) . When Ryan falls from his horse and breaks a leg , the lovers ride off , leaving him to dry up and die in the staring sun . Ryan , whose spirit normally comes from a bottle , nevertheless finds the will to fight his way back to safety and salvation . The drama is high , but it would have been much heightened had not the uncertain artifices of 3-D photography made the awful antagonist , the desert , look about as realistic and terrifying as a 98 herbarium . <P> Hannah Lee ( Jock Broder Productions ) refers to a cowboy ballad used as background music to one more encounter between the wicked cattle barons and the hapless homesteaders . Macdonald Carey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughhouse passes at the beautiful saloonkeeper ( Joanne Dru ) , and shoots harmless people dead . For all the gunplay , the film limps along from anticlimax to anticlimax , but moviegoers may be beguiled by some spectacular Technicolor scenery . As the U.S. marshal who goes to the rescue , John Ireland sets some sort of precedent by losing all his fist fights and getting shot down in the final gun battle with Badman Carey , who is then done in by Joanne Dru.
