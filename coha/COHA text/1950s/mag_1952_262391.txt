Seldom has there been such a musical love match as San Francisco and Pierre Monteux have both been enjoying . In 17 years as conductor of the San Francisco Symphony , Monteux 's teddy-bear figure and walrus mustache have become as well known and beloved by San Franciscans as their ferry boats and cable cars . Last week , as the idyl came to an end , San Francisco took a dab at its eyes . <P> Crowds overflowed the opera house for all three of " Papa " Monteux 's final concerts . His swan song was the same great work with which he has closed his 16 previous seasons : Beethoven 's choral symphony ( No. 9 ) . At the end , the audience gave the four soloists a polite round . When the old ( 77 ) conductor started to trudge offstage , he was recalled for ten minutes of shrieking and hysterical cheers . Papa Monteux finally waved them into quiet , then found that all he could say was : " Thank you ... I will not say goodbye , but au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something for the nonmusical man : " We 'll leave all the fancy words about his greatness as a musician to the music critics and just say that he was an extraordinarily likable guy , and that San Francisco will miss him and Mme. Monteux very much . " Lamented the Chronicle : " The end of an era in the cultural life of this community . " <P> It was indeed the end of an era . Pierre Monteux came to San Francisco from the Boston Symphony ( where he preceded Koussevitzky ) to take over a depression-racked orchestra that had given only four concerts the year before . He built its season into 22 weeks , and the orchestra itself into one of the half-dozen finest in the land . He gave San Franciscans clear and powerful Beethoven , Brahms and Wagner , surpassing performances of Franck and Berlioz , engaging ones of the music of his friends Debussy , Ravel and Stravinsky . He wanted to quit San Francisco " while I can still conduct . " <P> A Vivacious Cancan . Monteux was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians gave him a party at which the eleven women of the orchestra put on a vivacious cancan . Cracked Monteux , " It took me 17 years to see what pretty legs they have . " With enormous gusto , he knifed into a huge cake lettered " Au revoir , cher Matre . " And he set straight one matter that has intrigued San Franciscans for years : " I make you a declaration . My hair , it is not dyed . " <P> Although Monteux is 77 , he does not intend to stop conducting . He will lead the Boston Symphony , as associate conductor with Charles Munch , during a European tour next month . And this summer he will conduct in Manhattan 's Lewisohn Stadium , at Tanglewood and at Chicago 's Ravinia Park , and run his conducting school in Maine . He is booked at home &; abroad straight through the spring of 1953 . <P> San Francisco will get along next season with guest conductors . Everyone in town agrees with the Examiner : " It is going to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up Monteux 's standards of mastery . "
