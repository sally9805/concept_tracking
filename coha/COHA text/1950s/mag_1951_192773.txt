Somebody is always rising to announce that mankind has arrived at a dead end , or at least a stop light . In the October issue of Harper 's , a new warning voice rolls out , announcing that civilization 's " 400-year boom " is over because civilized nations have no more geographical frontiers to push back . The voice comes , oddly enough , from Texas . It belongs to Professor Walter Prescott Webb , a thoughtful student of history . <P> In Manhattan , some 300 scientists , doctors , astronomers , engineers , aviators and lawyers were too busy to hear it . They were gathered at the Hayden Planetarium for the first annual Symposium on Space Travel , and they were loading up modern Conestoga wagons for the interstellar frontiers . <P> If a rocket ship is to avoid collisions with meteors , said Dr. Fred L. Whipple , chairman of Harvard 's department of astronomy , it should keep pretty well out of the orbits of the earth and the comets , and particularly try to detour around the asteroid belt between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't necessarily be fatal .

Meteorites would explode on that bumper and lose most of their power of penetration . " <P> From the Air Force 's department of space medicine , Dr. Heinz Haber spoke up . Said he : " The weightless condition to which a space pilot would be subjected ... is not going to influence breathing or circulation noticeably-it is the nervous system that needs watching . " <P> A lawyer , Oscar Schachter , deputy director of the United Nations Legal Division , raised the question of who owns space . He suggested that all space beyond a planet 's atmosphere be designated as a sort of " high seas , " open to all comers under a kind of interplanetary admiralty law . <P> Rocket Expert Dr. Willy Ley wanted to get going on plans for a rocket platform to be shot out beyond the atmosphere so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one of earth 's satellites . Such a satellite would be a marker for navigators , a refueling station for interplanetary pilots , and a wonderful " earth-watching platform , " said he . <P> Dr. Webb and his disappearing frontier to the contrary , it appears that there is still considerable elbow room over the next ridge .
