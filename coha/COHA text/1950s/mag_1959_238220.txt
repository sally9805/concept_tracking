Ava Gardner and her ex-husband Frank Sinatra , separately or in pair , have never stood high on the State Department 's list of good-will ambassadors . That , as they make clear , is not what they are hired for . Last week Ava and Frankie were in Australia , she on location for her movie On the Beach , he for a concert engagement . Yet even their well-known aversion to crowds and the press could not keep the Aussies at a distance . The result was something special , even by Hollywood standards . <P> What got everybody burned up for fair was Ava 's refusal to show up at two scheduled press conferences ; then she irritated photographers by rarely appearing in public without a newspaper or purse to hide her pretty face . In answer , the papers served up juicy stories of a roaring party in Melbourne , Ava 's bitter argument over her hotel room : it was newly decorated , but she insisted that it be done again with expensive English wallpaper . So sore was the Melbourne Truth ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging from the surf bedraggled and clutching at her bikini . Headlined the Truth : AVA ALL WET . <P> The battle was only starting . In Sydney a daily Sun reporter charged that he had walked up to Ava at a local pub and got a drink of champagne in his face , and the glass with it . Said he : " As I stood there dripping amid shattered glass , she gave me her views on the press in gutter language running mostly to fundamental four-letter words . " Newsmen reported that she expressed the same views in roughly the same terms about the city of Melbourne to a nonplused officer of the aircraft carrier Melbourne , lent to the moviemakers by the Australian navy . <P> Frankie 's arrival was the capper . He snarled " Nothing to say " to reporters greeting him at the airport , threatened ( his weight : 140 Ibs. ) a photographer at the Melbourne Stadium , where he appeared : " Take another picture and I 'll ram that camera down your throat . You stink . " Cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants him ? " The answer , obviously , was Ava ; she haunted his dressing room at the stadium , a front-row seat when he sang " Why not take all of me ? " and his suite at his hotel . But bodyguards were always outside to intimidate rubbernecks . When Frankie flew into Sydney , some 1,000 fans turned out to cheer ; when he left last week , there were nine .
