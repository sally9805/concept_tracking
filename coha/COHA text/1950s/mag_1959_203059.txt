It was the most crowded August yet in the 100-year history of the French Riviera , a place which in Queen Victoria 's day thought itself a winter resort . From Menton on the Italian border all along the beautifully indented 165-mile coast to La Ciotat outside Marseille , the sunlit Cte d'Azur was jammed with a half-million vacationing Frenchmen and hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists . <P> Stifled Yawn . Greta Garbo slipped into a royal blue bikini and plunged into the Mediterranean from her Cap d'Ail villa . Sir Winston Churchill and Maria Callas , the prima of prima donnas , cruised offshore in the yacht of Greek Shipowner Aristotle Onassis . The young Aga Khan , fresh from Harvard , kept happy a chateauful of guests , including pretty Tracy Pelissier . Belgium 's King Baudouin holidayed solemnly at Cabassol with his sister Princess Josphine-Charlotte and her husband , Prince Jean of Luxembourg . The week before , Adlai Stevenson had been playing tennis at St.-Jean-Cap-Ferrat . Moviemaker Darryl F. Zanuck and his good friend , Chanteuse Juliette Greco , were at the Htel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpets and almost no one goes into the water . Spain 's Prince Juan Carlos handled a sailboat off Cannes ; and a $215,000 jewel theft last week from the Cap-d'Antibes villa of a British textile millionaire proved the season a social success . <P> But numbers not names made the season what it was , jamming the beaches , the bistros , the boulevards . Among the regulars , a social historian might have noted an evolutionary decline in the Riviera male . His feet are no longer used for walking , but only to depress accelerators or shuffle through the cha cha cha . Long hours spent in low sports cars seemed to have given him a spinal slump . His flaccid hands may seem barely strong enough to steady a highball glass or stifle a yawn . <P> In contrast , the Riviera female is in the throes of full , Amazonian development . Her brightly painted toes flicker through the nimble measures of the Charleston ; her wrists grow strong beneath the weight of jangling bracelets ; her long thighs are shaped to glued-on toreador slacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of false eyelashes , spare bandannas , waterproof mascara , lipstick brushes , eyelid pencils , bobby pins , suntan oils , combs , tweezers , compacts , cigarettes , stray hairs left by the cat . Atop her head is a brimmed straw-hat pulled over a voile scarf tied babushka-style , and she turns on the world the blind stare of dark glasses . She strides along confidently , her breasts thrown forward . <P> Raucous Jungle . The natural habitat of the Riviera male and female is either a hillside villa , a gleaming yacht or a huge hotel . Who could be a snob and not stay at the Carlton in Cannes ? One guest kept three Chihuahuas on leash , another rushed in and out with a live leopard in his arms , and neither attracted much attention . Monte Carlo 's sprawling Hotel de Paris had its rooms filled with idle maharajas , well-to-do Americans , lost Frenchmen . Nice 's Htel Negresco welcomed financiers who kept the switchboard busy with their calls to brokers in Paris , London and New York .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
