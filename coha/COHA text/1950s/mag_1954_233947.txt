At the House of Representatives in the West African city of Lagos ( pop . 250,000 ) , British Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton rapped for order one day last week at a conference of Nigeria 's political leaders . " This is one of Churchill 's cigars , " said the Colonial Secretary , depositing a miniature torpedo in the center of the conference table . " I propose not to smoke it unless we get into difficulties , but if you see me light it you will know that a crisis has been reached . " <P> The Africans round the table took heed : they well understood that if the cigar was lighted , Nigeria 's hopes for early independence might easily go up in smoke . Lyttelton 's object at the conference was to devise a new federal constitution that will enable Nigeria 's 30 million to achieve self-government along the same lines as their neighbors in the boom ing Gold Coast , without falling out in the process . The Africans too are eager for independence - but divided in factions . <P> Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose 16 mil lion are ruled by Moslem Emirs ; the southwest , where the Yoruba people , led by Barrister Obafemi Awolowo , make their headquarters in the world 's largest Negro city , Ibadan ( pop . 459.000 ) ; and the southeast , which is Ibo-land , presided over by big-eared Nnamdi ( Zik ) Azikiwe , the flamboyant , U.S.-educated newspaper publisher whose oratory sways the Lagos mob . Usually , Ibo and Yoruba make common cause against the Moslem north ; but last week their leaders were feuding over the flourishing port of Lagos . <P> Zik wants Lagos to become a federal capital , " like Washington , " electing its own representatives ( whom he would control ) without reference to Awolowo , in whose territory it sits . Lyttelton gave his blessing to the idea of a Nigerian D.C. , and the result was that Dr. Zik suddenly proclaimed himself an " I-Like-Lyttelton " man . Awolowo 's reaction was to blast the burly Tory as " a Machiavellian divider and ruler , " and to threaten to pull Yoru-baland out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his senses . At week 's end it was still unsmoked , and the conference had approved : 1 ) financial arrangements for an all-Nigerian government ; 2 ) a reorganization of its cocoa-marketing board , which has a financial half nelson on the world 's chocolate prices . Proposed solution for Lagos : federal status , with its own special minister , independent of both Zik and Awolowo.
