One day around 1800 , an already notorious teen-age violinist arrived in Leghorn to play a concert-with no violin . His name was Nicolo Paganini , and he had pawned his fiddle to pay off a pressing gambling debt . A wealthy merchant offered to lend him a matchless Guarneri del Gesu and , when the performance was over , refused to take it back . " The Guarneri is yours , " he cried . " My hands shall never profane the violin which you have touched ! " <P> Paganini treasured the instrument for the rest of his life . He took it home to Genoa , where he devised some of the fantastic technical tricks-such as playing pizzicato with his left hand while bouncing his bow across the strings with his right to create a dazzling cascade of notes-that bewitched audiences all over Europe . On the last night of his life , in 1840 , he called for it , and spent some of his last moments improvising on its strings . In his will , he left it to the city of Genoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long suspected him of a pact with the devil : How else could a man do with a violin what Paganini did ? The Genoese enshrined his Guarneri in the city hall-though they were still uneasy about its late owner , and the Pope himself had to launch an inquiry into Paganini 's orthodoxy before he could be buried in consecrated ground years later . <P> Genoa has long abided by the fiddler 's will . Every year the mayor , the community 's secretary general , a museum official and a notary public gather around the glass case , solemnly break the seal and lift the violin out for an annual tuning and workout . In latter years , a distinguished violinist has been invited to do the job . This year Genoa took out some extra Paganini memorabilia , asked French Violinist Zino Francescatti to give the Guarneri its annual tuning . Perhaps because Francescatti is Paganini 's lineal musical descendant ( his father studied with Paganini 's only real pupil ) , Genoese decided to give him a still greater honor : a half-hour concert in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His program : one of Paganini 's 24 famed Caprices and the Bach Chaconne . Standing by for the event , Francescatti admitted he felt solemn . " It is like taking on the mantle of Paganini , " he said , " or waiting anxiously to meet the devil . "
