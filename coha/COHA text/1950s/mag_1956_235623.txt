Not content with his popular title , " General Russia , " Dedan capped his arrogance by calling himself Field Marshal Sir Dedan Kimathi and appointing a parliament of his own to preside over . The Nairobi government put a price of 500 on his head . <P> With the success of British arms , and quarreling within their own ranks , the Mau Mau are now on the run .

Broken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days making wild speeches to the jungle trees and his nights raving endlessly . He lies on a litter of branches , blubbering and blabbering about reform in the Liberation army , while his friends search the woods for monkeys to eat .
