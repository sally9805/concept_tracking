Only three teams were left in the Masters ' Knockout Team Championship at Miami Beach last August . Each had been defeated once . One more defeat meant curtains . Robert Rothlein 's team had won the bye and was sitting it out while Alvin Roth 's and Harry Fishbein 's teams battled to see which would survive . Each of the two tables , remote at opposite ends of the Americana 's Floridian Room , was ringed three deep with craning kibitzers. // In this tense situation , while defending against a doubled contract , Harry Fishbein reneged ! If detected before either he or his partner , Sam Fry Jr. , played to the next trick , the revoke could have been corrected . At least half of the gallery were ardent Fishbein rooters . Yet , to the everlasting credit of all members of that oft-maligned breed , the kibitzer , there was n't a gasp or a murmur or a rustle of surprise that might have called attention to the error . The penalty for the revoke  --  two tricks  --  was just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , these exemplary kibitzers receive their reward  --  an opportunity to watch the playoff between the Vanderbilt Cup-winning Fishbein team and its two-time conquerors in the Masters ' Knockout event , the Rothlein team . The match will decide which team will represent America ( including Canada , Mexico , Bermuda and the U.S. ) in the February world championship meeting with Italy 's European champions and the champions of South America , as yet undecided . The dates : Saturday and Sunday , October 25 and 26 . The place : the Gold Ballroom of the Hotel Statler Hilton in New York City . The starting times : 1:30 each afternoon and 8:30 each evening . The best reward of all : the match can be viewed under conditions which impose no strain on the kibitzer 's eyes or self-control . Indeed , he may cheer if he likes . He 'll be able to hear the players , but they wo n't be able to hear him . // Two problems have stood in the way of making bridge a spectator sport : how to let a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the players from being influenced by the reactions of the spectators . Thus far , the simplest and most easily followed technique is to show the hands in the kind of diagram familiar to bridge-column readers , to tune in on the playing room for the bidding and play , and to show the play by x-ing out the cards on the diagram , thrown on a large screen . This method , used successfully in the telecast of the world championship in 1957 , will be used again to show the playoff. // With the players separated from the audience by a soundproof wall , kibitzers can indulge the luxury of cheering , groaning , speculating on the proper play , criticizing mistakes and listening to commentary by a group of experts , among them your reporter . The price of all this is a mere $1.50 per session . // It is exciting to think that 500 people , instead of only 15 or 20 , may watch hands like this one , played in the final match at Miami . // Both Wests opened the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successfully finessed in spades and returned to dummy 's king of hearts for another spade lead . The appearance of East 's king was disappointing , but after a headachey analysis both expert declarers decided against cashing the ace of hearts . ( Without going into the complex considerations involved , that decision would appear to be correct but for the six-two division in diamonds and the singleton honor in clubs . ) Each South elected to cash the remaining high spade , discard dummy 's diamond and hope that East would be the defender with three trumps . East ruffed the spade with the seven of hearts . // Thus far the play had been the same at both tables , but now came the parting of the ways . With Robert Rothlein and Cyrus Neuman of Miami defending , Neuman led back a low club . Rothlein won with the king and returned a spade , ruffed in dummy and overruffed by East 's queen . A second club lead made it impossible for declarer to shut out West 's heart jack . // At the other table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Hanna of Los Angeles playing North and Paul Allinger of Alameda , Calif . South . Instead of leading back a low club after ruffing the third spade , East cashed the club ace . The fall of West 's king alerted Allinger to his danger . If West could overruff the second club another spade play would doom the contract . In this difficult situation , Allinger guessed right . He trumped the second club with the ace and played a low trump , dropping the jack and queen together . Dummy 's trumps and good clubs took care of South 's remaining losers . // Both the Rothlein and the Fishbein entries are five-man teams . The Rothlein player you have not met thus far is Sidney Lazard of New Orleans , who distinguished himself as West in defense against this slam hand . // Details of the bidding are no longer recalled . Both teams bid to six no trump and both got the same opening lead of the heart 10. // Looking at all four hands , it is obvious that the slam can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spade , declarer leads a diamond toward his king-queen . When West takes the ace , South 's best hope of a 12th trick is the club finesse . It wins , and the slam comes home  --  exactly as happened when Rothlein 's team held the North-South hands . // The difference when the Fishbein team held the slam hand was that Lazard saw no reason to force declarer to adopt the winning line of play . Thinking right along with declarer , he foresaw the diamond lead and played the deuce under the king without the slightest huddle or hesitation . Now , would you take the unproved club finesse or repeat the " successful " diamond lead from dummy ? Declarer elected to play East for the ace of diamonds and Lazard cashed in on one of bridge 's oldest axioms : If nothing else will serve , give the opponents a chance to make a mistake . // If I seem to be dwelling upon Rothlein successes and Fishbein failures , it is with good reason . I have already recorded here some of the brilliant exploits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with Fry and Fishbein , to roll undefeated through every match to win the Vanderbilt championship last March . They continued that winning streak in the Masters ' Knockout event until they had rolled up a string of 14 consecutive victories . Upset by Rothlein in their 15th match , they rallied to defeat Roth in the semifinal , only to bow to Rothlein again in the final . // To a considerable measure , this was due to partnership misunderstandings such as occurred in the following deal . // Hazen intended his two no-trump bid as " unusual "  --  that is , a conventional call for a minor suit . Fishbein read it as possibly a good club suit and a heart stopper . // All would still have been well if Rothlein had led a fourth-best heart . But after toying with that card several times he finally chose to lead the king . Result : down three at no trump with game ice-cold at either clubs or diamonds . // Does the one-sidedness of this report mean that I am picking Rothlein to win ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live so far apart , they must suffer from unpracticed partnership among three of their five players . // The greater length of this playoff match gives the Fishbein veterans an advantage . So does the fact that four of them will be playing before a hometown audience , while their opponents will have traveled far . In the kind of close match I figure this to be , such matters can be decisive . // As the referee would say , may the better team win . And best of viewing to the kibitzers !
