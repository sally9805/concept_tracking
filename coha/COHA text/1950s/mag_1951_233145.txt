It was typical summer weather last week as the South African gliding meet began on the broad plateau at Baragwanath . All morning thick cumulus clouds built up in the hot , dry air over the Rand . At noon , Swiss Engineer Ren Comte folded his wiry frame into the cramped , rubber-cushioned cockpit of his sleek Moswey ( Buzzard ) IV glider , fitted the bubble canopy in place and took off , towed by a sturdy little Tiger-Moth . With good luck he hoped to fly to Bloemfontein , 200 miles away . <P> When he was 1,200 ft. over Baragwanath , Comte cut loose his tow . Some ten miles to the south he spotted a towering thunderhead . Rain poured from its base , and lightning played around the high-riding , anvil-headed cloud . Sure that it would contain powerful updrafts , Comte headed for it . As he maneuvered under its base , he switched on his electrically driven gyro-horizon . <P> For Two Diamonds . An experienced pilot with six years of soaring in the U.S. and the Swiss Alps behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * But if it boosted him high enough , he could coast down to Bloemfontein . And he would earn two coveted " diamonds " for his gold gliding badge : one for an altitude gain of at least 16,700 ft. , the other for a flight of at least 186 miles to a predetermined point . <P> Spiraling in the violent updrafts of the thunderhead , his ship was quickly smothered in grey , impenetrable fog . Rain lashed at the canopy . The outside air temperature dropped . Comte continued to circle , nose down , while his plane climbed faster and faster-like a man moving upstairs while strolling slowly downward on a racing escalator . At 11,000 ft. the rain turned to hail that tore noisily at the wings . The airspeed indicator froze , and the rate-of-climb indicator stuck at 5 ft. per second . The needle of the glider 's sealed barograph reached its limit at 27,000 ft . But the plane , bucking and pitching in the turbulent winds , kept on climbing . <P> Like a Crazy Clock . Comte turned on oxygen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round and round like the hands of a crazy clock . " After 15 minutes it registered 32,000 ft . The fog turned thin and milky , letting a little sunlight filter through . Suddenly there was a blinding flash . Said Comte afterward : " The whole cloud lit up , with me inside it . I felt lightning hit the top of my head a sharp blow and run through my hands into the control column . The plane continued flying steady , but I was scared . " <P> Comte leveled out on a compass course for Bloemfontein and nosed out of the cloud . He was flying in the open , but all around him were high fog and more clouds . Comte headed into the fog , flew through steady downdrafts until he broke out again at 6,000 ft. , 70 miles from where he had started his high , wild ride . For an hour and a half he tried to get around the rain fronts that hemmed him in , but he was finally forced down at Vredefort , 150 miles from his destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not claim the South African gliding altitude record , which now stands at 21,000 ft . He will have to send the record from his sealed barograph home to Switzerland for any official recognition . In Johannesburg , however , South Africa 's Champion Harry Lasch shook his head in amazement at Comte 's flight . Official or not , " it was magnificent , and is going to be very hard to beat .
