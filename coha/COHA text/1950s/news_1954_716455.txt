She seeks a substantial credit from the bank to modernize her factories , purchase up-to-date productive ma-I chinery of all kinds and rehabilitate her shipyards . Mr. Iguchi would not estimate the amount Japan would ask of the United States through direct aid or a long-term loan similar to that arranged with Britain after World War II .
