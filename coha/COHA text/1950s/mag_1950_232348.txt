Wiry , bustling Bernard Cornelius Duffy , 48 , president of the big Batten , Barton , Durstine &; Osborn advertising agency , has the occupational ailment of his trade : peptic ulcers . He works at such a man-eating pace that , as he says , " I only call home if , by happy surprise , I can get there for supper . " <P> Last week , Ben Duffy got some balm for his wounds . Advertising Age , the industry 's bible , reported that fast-growing B.B.D. &; O. had crowded Young &; Rubicam out of second place among U.S. agencies , ringing up total billings of $81.4 million , $400,000 more than Y. &; R.* <P> Duffy , and his far-flung team of 50 vice presidents and 1,150 employees in eleven U.S. cities , had done it by snagging choice new accounts ( Lucky Strike , Schick Razors , Swan Soap , T.W.A. ) , and by hanging on to such B.B.D. &; O. perennials as U.S. Steel Corp. , Du Pont and General Electric . In six years , the agency had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than doubled its business . B.B.D. &O.; reports no gross revenue , but based on the usual 15% commission , its gross had risen to about $12 million a year . <P> Errand Boy . Up from Manhattan 's " Hell 's Kitchen , " Duffy , a son of Irish immigrants , virtually grew up with the agency he now runs . After quitting high school at 17 , he got a messenger boy 's job with newly formed Barton , Durstine &; Osborn. + Duffy liked to come in early to slip into the president 's chair to see how it felt . After two years of errand-running , he became a space buyer , soon earned a reputation as a digger for facts and became the agency 's top media man . When President Barton decided to step up as chairman four years ago , Duffy sat down in the president 's chair on his own right . <P> In the razzle-dazzle world of huck-sterdom , whose currency is superlatives , plain-talking , unassuming Ben Duffy sticks out at the elbows . He has a genial gregariousness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgets a face . His memory is so photographic that he sometimes startles ' his secretary by recalling verbatim a letter dictated years before . Before he lets a staffer make a sales presentation to a prospective client , Duffy insists that he bone up on every pertinent fact of the client 's business . <P> Answer Man . Duffy abides by his own rule . Two years ago , when the American Tobacco Co. parted company with the agency handling its $12 million account , Duffy flew back from a Florida vacation before the news was even official , was soon hammering his facts at American Tobacco 's shrewd , hard-to-sell President Vincent Riggio . When Duffy was done , Riggio said : " I had a list of ten questions to ask you . You have already answered them all . " Duffy got the account , loyally chainsmokes Luckies . <P> Ben Duffy was not letting his latest triumph go to his head . " It worries me , getting up to second place , " he said . " If it gives us a sense of complacency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> *Still in first place : J. Walter Thompson , with $121 million in billings . <P> + Merged with George Batten &; Co. in 1928 . Of the four names in B.B.D. &; O. , only Chair man Bruce Barton and Vice Chairman Alex Osborn remain with the agency . Batten died in 1918 ; Roy S. Durstine set up his own agency eleven years ago .
