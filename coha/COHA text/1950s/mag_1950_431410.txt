 | The Extraordinary Story of Helen Keller Condensed from " Journey into Light " BY ISHBEL Ross HELEN KELLER , now 70 , has an ageless quality about her ? inherent even in her looks ? in keeping with her amazing life story . Blind , ( leaf and mute from early childhood , she rose above her triple handicap to become one of the best-known characters in the modern world and an inspiration to both the blind and the seeing everywhere . When she visited postwar Japan boys and girls in remote villages ran to greet her , crying " 1-Ielen Keller ! " Her name had penetrated jungle fastnesses before the days of radio or the cinema . Although warmed by this human reaction , she has no wish to be set aside from the rest of mankind . She believes the blind should live and work like their fellows , unremarked and with full responsibility . In the inner quiet of her own dark castle she builds up strength and force to spend on her fellow afflicted . Each decade brings her fresh wisdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest to her observe that her articulation improved noticeably in her 6o 's . She frequently makes recordings , and the voice of Helen Keller ? which in itself represents one of the chief areas of effort in her life ? is heard across the world . Her mastery of speech has been called " the greatest individual achievement in the history of education . " Helen , at ten years old , already was reading Braille avidly and could communicate by means of the manual alphabet . That spring of 1890 she learned of a deaf , dumb and blind Norwegian girl who had been  | taught to talk . Helen burned with ambition . Like lightning she spelled into Anne Sullivan 's hand : " I must speak . " Miss Sullivan took Helen to Miss Sarah Fuller , principal of the Horace Mann School for the Deaf in Boston . Miss Fuller went to work at once , passing Helen 's hand lightly over the lower part of her face , and putting Helen 's fingers into her mouth , so that she might feel the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lower jaw and the course of the trachea . Miss Fuller then set her tongue in the bed of the jaw just behind the lower front teeth for the sound of i in it . Next she put Helen 's forefinger against her teeth , another finger on her throe t and repeated the sound several times . As soon as she had ceased , Helen 's " fingers flew to her own mouth and throat and , after arranging her tongue and teeth , she uttered a sound so nearly like what I had made that it seemed an echo of it . " Then they practiced the vowels a and o , which Helen repeated distinctly . After this they tried the words mamma and papa . Miss Fuller delicately pronounced the word mamma , at the same time drawing her finger along the back of Helen 's hand to indicate the relative length of the two syllables . After a few repetitions , mamma and papa came correctly and with " almost musical sweetness from her lips . " Going home in the streetcar after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " hollow , breathy tones " : I am not dumb now . This was her first real use of words in conveying a thought , and it came within a month after her first lesson in articulation . It was human speech from the lips of one who , except for her early baby babblings , had reached the age of ten uttering Dr. Alexander Graham Bell said . His own skepticism had been washed away earlier when he paid Helen an unexpected visit after receiving a letter from her so beautifully written and well composed that he could not believe the deaf , dumb and blind child was its author . However , he found her alone in a room , writing to someone else with equal skill and fluency . He became her close friend , and remained so to the end of his life . Helen took 11 lessons from Miss Fuller , but this was only the beginning of her long tussle with speech . Week after week , month after month , year after year , she labored to improve enunciation . She repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the vibrations of Miss Sullivan 's throat , the movement of her tongue and lips , the expression of her face as she talked . She has never ceased to labor over her voice , to make speeches in public and to conduct much of her conversation by direct speech . Her voice has a keening quality , strange to listen to ; her sentences are un-  | accented . She appears to speak with effort . Her clenched right hand describes a parabola and domes down briskly on her left palm , putting an emphatic period to her last sentence . At the same time her face relaxes in a most winning smile , erasing all impression of the great effort she seems to have made . " I have only partially conquered the hostile silence , " she says . " My voice is not a pleasant one , I am afraid , but I have clothed its broken wings in the unfailing hues of my dreams and my struggle for it has strengthened every fiber of my being and deepened my understanding of all human strivings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by vibration . By placing , the middle finger on the nose , her forefinger on the lips and her thumb on the larynx , she can " hear what others say , " particularly if their speech is clear and resonant . She found Franklin D. Roosevelt an ideal subject in this respect . She caught Mark Twain 's best jokes by vibration . With her fingers on his lips Enrico Caruso " poured his golden voice " into her hand . Feodor Chaliapin shouted the " Volga Boat Song " with his arm encircling her tightly so that she could feel every vibration of his mighty voice . Jascha Heifetz played for her while her fingers rested lightly on his violin . She has read Carl Sandburg 's verses from his lips and old plantation folk songs from the rim of his banjo . With her hand resting on a piano she detects " tiny quavers , returns of mel- ody and the rush that follows . " She gets some small response by vibration from radio , too . HE initial penetration of the dark mists that enshrouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years old . Born in the little Alabama town of Tuscumbia , she was a normal baby up to 19 months and seemed to enjoy the flowers , the flitting birds , the play of light and shadow . Then she was stricken with a " fever of brain and stomach . " She was desperately ill , but the fever subsided almost as suddenly as it had begun . Soon her mother noticed that Helen 's eyes did not close when she bathed the child . She took her to an oculist and learned that Helen was blind . Next she noticed that the child did not respond to the loud ringing of a bell . Helen was deaf , too . Inevitably , by the age of three she was also mute , and such words as she had babbled at 18 months were forgotten . Helen grew fast and was physically strong and well formed , but her good nature dissolved in frantic tantrums . Her failure to make herself understood was followed by wild gusts of rage . She would fling herself on the grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners were appalling . She would not wash her face or button her shoes . Years later she wrote : " l felt as if invisible hands were holding me . I made frantic efforts to free myself . "  | Her gentle mother , cowed by suet violence , gave in to her at ever point . There was great power it Helen , instead of the apathy that usually rests heavily on the triply handicapped child . Here lay the germ of her future success . But Mrs Keller was close to despair when she picked up Charles Dickens ' American Notes and read of Laura Bridgman , the deaf , mute and blind girl in New England whose mind had been reached by Samuel Gridley Howe . Finally Helen was taken to Michael Anagnos , who had succeeded Dr. Howe as head of the Perkin . Institution . He recommended as tutor an Irish girl who had just been graduated . This was Anne Sullivan , who was to be Helen Keller 's inseparable companion for the next half century . She was the child of Irish immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken father beat her . She was starved . bruised , neglected , and finally was , abandoned to the almshouse as a state charge . She entered Perkins in i88o , blind from trachoma . Two operations virtually restored het sight , although she had trouble with her eyes all her life and became blind again in her later years . Anne Sullivan , arriving in Alabama , was struck by Helen Keller 's fine bearing and intelligent face , notwithstanding the fact that it " lacked mobility or soul . " Helen rushed at her as she stepped from the carriage . felt her dress and face , repulsed a caress , tried to open Miss Sullivan 's bag and staged a scene on the doorstep when Mrs. Keller attempted to take it from her . Miss Sullivan produced a doll sent by the Perkins children . When Helen , quickly beguiled , had played with it for some time Miss Sullivan spelled into her hand the letters d-o-l-l . The child 's attention was arrested by this unfamiliar maneuver and she tried to imitate the finger motions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ llclen Keller . When Miss Sullivan took away the doll a tussle began . It was the first of many . The new teacher moved Helen away from her distracted parents to an adjoining cottage . A herculean battle of wills raged for several days . It was a physical as well as a mental struggle , but Miss Sullivan won , even though she had to hold Elden down by force for two hours at a time to quell her fierce resistance . " I Ier restless spirit gropes in the dark , " Teacher commented . " Her untaught , unsatisfied hands destroy whatever they touch because they do not know what else to do with things . " She noticed that the child already had sundry ways of indicating her wishes . If she longed for ice cream she turned the handle of an imaginary freezer . For bread and butter she went through the motions of cutting and spreading . She pretended to put on glasses to symbolize her father . She took to rocking the new doll , making a monotonous chanting sound with her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also learned to spell new words by the manual language ? pin , hat , cup and verbs like sit , stand and walk . Within two weeks a gleam of light dawned . Miss Sullivan took her to the pump house and drew water . As it flowed into the mug and over the child 's right hand she spelled zv-a-t-e-r into the other . " The word , coming so close upon the sensation of cold water rushing over her hand , seemed to - startle her , " Miss Sullivan wrote . " She dropped the mug and stood as one transfixed . A new light came into her face . " Helen 's own recollection is : " Somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me . I knew then that water meant the wonderful cool something that flowed over my hand . That living word awakened my soul ; gave it light , hope , joy ; set it free ! " Helen returned to the house in a fever of excitement , touching everything as she moved , visibly seeking its name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump ? she knew now that everything had a name and she wished to know what it was . Within the space of a few hours she had added 30 new words to her vocabulary . From that point on her education proceeded with uncanny speed . " The eagerness with which she absorbs ideas is delightful , " Miss Sullivan related . " It is a rare privilege to watch the birth , growth and first feeblest rugglesofa living mind . " Miss Sullivan taught her to read with little sentences slipped into a frame , after each separate word  - -  raised on cardboard  --  had been placed beside its object , like doll is on bed . " When her fingers light on words she knows , " Miss Sullivan wrote , " she fairly screams with pleasure and hugs and kisses me for joy . When I gave her my Braille slate to amuse her the little witch soon was writing letters . I had no idea she knew what a letter was . " At the end of three months Helen knew 400 words and many idioms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , outdoors and in . They studied under tulip and mulberry trees , and everything that could " hum or buzz or sing or bloom " was part of Helen 's education . She felt the downy peaches in the orchard , squeezed the bursting cotton bolls , caught an insect in a plucked flower . She learned to distinguish mountain laurel from honeysuckle , and a pig from a hen . Miss Sullivan made raised maps in clay for her pupil , with strings and orange sticks for equator , meridians and poles . She taught Helen to count by stringing beads in groups , and arranging kindergarten straws for addition and subtraction . It was the only subject the child disliked . Her pencil writing soon was excellent . Within a month after trying it , she wrote a correctly spelled and legible letter to her cousin . Miss Keller 's handwriting today is square , artistic and always legible.  | By the end of August she knew 625 words . But after a year 's instruction Helen had become extremely pale and thin . Everyone thought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later when Helen was preparing for Radcliffe , but the teacher 's immediate comment was : " So far nobody seems to have thought of chloroforming her , which is , I think , the only effective way of stopping the natural exercise of her faculties . " At this point Helen became quite fond of dress and finery and insisted on having her hair put up in curls , no matter how exhausting her day had been . Miss SULLIVAN took Helen to Perkins Institution when she was eight , and a whole new world opened up for her . She had Braille books to read and she could associate with other children who knew the manual alphabet . She soon displayed sensational abilities . Miss Sullivan let her browse from book to book , picking out words at random , long before she could actually read them . She worked on a systematic basis , studying arithmetic , geography , zoology , botany and reading . This was no longer the free and spontaneous education of the outdoors , but Helen toiled over every aspect of her work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest she would say : " It will give me strength if I finish it now . " This habit of tireless industry persists , even in her do 's . These were days of great mental growth for Helen . As she and her teacher traveled , Teacher spelled into her hand fluent descriptions of the passing scene ? the hills and rivers , the hamlets and cities , the way people looked and what they wore . They summered on Cape Cod and Helen learned to swim , but her first splash into the sea brought a great surprise . No one had thought to tell her that there was salt in the ocean ! She learned to row and sail , to ride and use a tandem bicycle . The intellectuals of Boston were taking stock of this brilliant girl . Oliver Wendell Holmes wept when she recited Tennyson 's " Break , break , break " to him in halting sentences . John Greenleaf Whittier told her he could understand every word she said , which made Helen happy . She corresponded with famous men , writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she was tall , graceful , and showed charm and humor . College was the next step . Helen settled on Radcliffe and prepared with her usual thoroughness . She entered the Gilman School for Young Ladies in Cambridge and was intensively tutored , with Miss Sullivan always by her side to read the lectures into her hand . In 1900 she enrolled at Radcliffe , the first individual with a triple handicap to enter an institution of higher learn111g . But college was a disappointment to Helen . She did well , but felt the lack of time for meditation . She could not take notes during lectures  | because her hands were " busy listening . " She jotted down what she could remember when she got home . She used a Braille writer for algebra , geometry and physics , but she had little aptitude for mathematics . Examinations were a nightmare . But she enjoyed some of her classes and she and Teacher worked with their usual wholehearted concentration . They got Brained books from Germany and England , and Helen read until her fingers bled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English . She was 24 years old . Already requests were flowing in for appearances and for magazine articles . She was invited to the St. Louis Exposition in 1904 to awaken world-wide interest in the education of the deaf-blind . But on Helen Keller Day the crowds got out of hand . Her dress was torn to shreds . The roses were snatched from her hat . She prepared to lecture by taking special lessons with a music teacher . Again she strove for a regulated pitch . At times her voice would become unmanageable . It would dive down or go soaring up beyond her control . Rain , wind , dust or excitement affected its pitch . But in 1913 she made her first publicspeaking appearance . " My mind froze , " Helen commented at the time . She prayed . Words rose to her lips , but she could not utter a syllable . At last she forced out a sound that felt to her like a cannon going off . Later she was told it was only a whisper . But after this Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would demonstrate how she had taught young Helen . The pupil then would speak , winding up with the phrase : I am not dumb now . In 1914 they set out on the first of a number of transcontinental speaking tours . By this time a brisk and capable young Scottish girl , Polly Thomson , had joined them as secretary and manager . They went to Hollywood to make the film Deliverance . Then they embarked on a dignified vaudeville act , Miss Keller causing a sensation at the Palace in New York . Helen loved it . She found vaudeville full of life , color and variety . She " felt the Leath of the audience in her face . " Helen Keller was known now , around the world . Her books were translated into many languages , as well as into Braille . In the 1930 'S she began her international traveling . She went repeatedly to Europe , then to the Orient , interested always in the blind , talking for the blind , raising money for the blind . Those who had read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she was learned , composed and equal to any emergency . She received honorary degrees and decorations in many lands . But Teacher 's health was failing . She was almost blind . No longer could she keep up with the vigorous and healthy ' Helen . She died in 1936 , shortly after the last of a long series of eye-operations . That year the Roosevelt medal for " Coopera-  | tive Achievement of Unique Character and Far-Reaching Significance " was awarded to this remarkable pair . ToDAY Miss Keller and Miss " Thomson live in a graceful rambling house set in the Connecticut woods near Westport . A stone Japanese lantern , eight feet high , stands symbolically in one corner of the lawn with a constantly burning light ? not to go out while Helen Keller lives . A winding path leads from her garden to the woods , and here she likes to stroll and meditate alone , except for her dogs , moving along with her hand lightly touching a rustic handrail . Miss Keller spends long hours sitting tall and straight at the type-writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind of Australia , of India , of Japan , or whatever else comes up . Around the walls are her Braille books , which she reads until the fingertips that have traveled over so many miles of Braille have to be bound with silk for protection . Her Braille Bible is still her most valued possession . She knows great stretches by heart . She reads in the dark or the daylight , like all the blind , who sleep poorly and do not know night from day . Miss Thomson reads her the day 's headlines at breakfast and she chooses the news stories she wishes to hear . Articles that closely touch her interests are sometimes Brailled for her . Miss Keller can smell the woods and flowers beyond her windows . She knows when it rains or snows , when the sun shines or the day is gray , when the early grass comes up , the roses bloom , the leaves wither and smoke trails from autumn bonfires . She has her own suite shut off from the rest of the house and there she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . She tidies her own bathroom , makes her own bed , keeps her papers in place , emerges neat as a pin in the morning , often as early as five o'clock . She and Miss Thomson garden at dawn , when the weather is right . She likes to cut grass , to weed and to rake leaves . Time seems to have made few physical inroads . She looks extraordinarily young for 70 , her face unlined , her hair only lightly streaked with gray . Her eyes are blue and bright ; not the lackluster eyes of the blind , but alive and expressive . Helen Keller is deeply spiritual . Her faith sustains her in the quiet hours when she retreats from her busy life into the deep silence that only the deaf , blind and mute can know . Around her shines the steady flame of character , purpose and hard work . " I look forward to the world to come , " she says , " where all physical limitations will drop from me like shackles ; where I shall again find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I have yet known .
