A year had passed , and as the 44,000 civil servants and intellectuals trooped back to their desks in Peking , the Communist press could scarcely find words rapturous enough to describe the change that had come over them . The 44,000 had just completed a " year 's tempering in productive work . " Translation : they had been ideologically " remolded ' ' by a year 's forced manual labor in the country . <P> The intellectuals , burbled one Red newspaper , " braved wind and snow , traveled at night , lived in thatched huts built with their own hands . Sometimes it was so cold that the comrades could not sleep . The comrades would make a fire and sing around it . " So happy were these " heroes of the high mountains " that they forgot their " individualism , bureaucratism , and subjectivism and acquired labor conception , mass conception , and collective conception . How the cadres love labor and have changed their mental outlook ! " <P> Scarves &; Parades . In Hong Kong last week , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . Lo Chih-ching was nine when the Communists took over Peking , and his first memories of the new regime were of wearing a gay red scarf and marching proudly in parades . By the time he was eleven , he was lecturing his parents on the virtues of Communism . Then , one night during a government anticorruption campaign , a band of party members broke into his house and ransacked it on the pretense of looking for " hidden treasure . " It was Lo 's first jolt , and soon there were others . <P> His mother was forced to attend a public meeting at which her husband was denounced . A classmate denounced his own brother , and the brother was executed . A 14-year-old girl denounced her father , and the father killed himself . A professor was denounced , went mad , and ended up " living in a pig sty . " Lo himself was subjected to weeks of public criticism for reading pre-Communist novels rather than progressive ones . Then came the directive ordering all politically suspect students and intellectuals sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friendly Emulation . " In Peking , Lo had heard much about what the government had done for the peasant , but the peasants in the village where he was sent had apparently been overlooked . They lived in mud huts , got bread only when they worked , got seven feet of cloth a year with which to clothe themselves . Bitter and resentful , they never complained , for " everyone is afraid in China . " Lo worked 16 hours a day , slept in his clothes to keep warm , did not take a bath for three months . Finally , he hit upon a way to escape . <P> He decided to show his superiors how " positive " he was by challenging his comrades to " friendly emulation in work . " He was so successful that one day he was permitted to walk to Peking for a holiday . There , he wrote a letter full of subtle hints to some relatives in Hong Kong . The relatives got the hints , later sent him a cable saying his father was dying . Lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Hong Kong .
