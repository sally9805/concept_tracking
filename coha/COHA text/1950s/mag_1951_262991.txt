G.I. Zoologist Bivouacked in the piny hills near the Han early last week , the 25th Division had its hands full digging in for the expected Chinese assault . But for the buddies of Corporal William Old even the din of Communist whistles and bugles was hardly more terrifying than his tales of poisonous mollusks , leopards , bears and 1,500-lb . Manchurian tigers roaming the Korean countryside . The fascinated G.I.s had good reason to believe that baby-faced " Buster " Old knew what he was talking about . <P> Youngest member of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists , Buster Old , a 23-year-old photo-lab technician in the Army 's Signal Corps , has been an amateur zoologist since childhood , is now a highly respected , unofficial investigator for the Smithsonian Institution . Ever since August , the Smithsonian 's molluskmen have been expectantly watching the mails for the tobacco tins , metal film containers and glass medicine bottles in which he has sent them nearly 500 specimens of Korean frogs , lizards , snakes , crayfish and snails . <P> On the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during stopovers in Hawaii and Japan . But his snail searches really paid off when he began exploring the zoological possibilities of the battle zone . ( " Hunting for snails and so forth is a wonderful thing for guys like that , " explains one Smithsonian curator . " Gets their minds off the bullets whizzing around . " ) <P> Some freshwater snails that Old sent back are the first received by the Smithsonian since a shipment by a German collector in the 1890s . Some of the specimens arrived alive , making it possible to study their anatomy for the first time , and they have found Washington 's alien climate so attractive that they have already begun to reproduce themselves . Old 's prize find : a stream-bed that was paved with Semisulcospira amurensis , a carrier of the lung-fluke larva which causes a disease with symptoms often confused with those of tuberculosis . <P> Besides hunting Chinese Reds and Korean snails , Buster serves as adviser to his outfit on all matters zoological . He has taught them to recognise a poisonous snake or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on swimming in the Han : little danger of schistosomiasis because oncomelania prefer narrow , shaded streams . A good chance of picking up paragonimiasis because the broad , open river might have Paragonimus westermani. * <P> <P> * Free translation : the snails that are host to the parasite causing swimmer 's itch and even nastier diseases probably wo n't be found in the Han . But if you want to gamble on a dose of lung flukes , the Han is pretty sure to have them .
