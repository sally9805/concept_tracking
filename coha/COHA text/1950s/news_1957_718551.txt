txt setters to The Times ) g. 34 ' Letters to The Times Court Reform Endorsed Alleviation of Hardships Resulting From Present System Is Seen To THE EDITOR OF THE New York TIMES : The Women 's City Club of New York has noted with great satisfaction your continuous support of the plan for reorganization of the courts of the State of . New York submitted to the current Legislature by the Temporary Commission on the Courts , or Tweed commission . As a city-wide nonpartisan organization we have observed courts in all five counties of the city . Our consequent awareness of the confused situation in New York City and of the need for court reorganization has prompted most thorough study of the Temporary Commission 's successive proposals , participation in many public hearings , consultations with judges and civic leaders , and weighing of diverse opinions . The Women 's City Club concluded that the final plan of the Temporary Commission is sound attic/ far-seeing . It would provide a unified and simplified state-wide court structure . so urgently needed to remedy the complexities and fragmentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritable hodge-podge over the past 100 years . The plan would strengthen the administrative power of the judicial conference over the entire court system , consolidate the numerous New York ' : City courts into two courts , with a family part in the Supreme Court to handle family matters now dispersed in four courts . Far-Reaching Plan All of these proposals add up to a well-conceived and far-reaching plan ? the first realistic attempt to achieve long overdue changes in our present chaotic court structure : Other changes , . if needed , may be made in the future , once this basic reorganization goes into effect . Our enthusiastic approval of this plan is based on months of intensive consideration . When the Women 's City Club was founded , over forty years ago , one of its primary interests was the prevention and correction of lawlessness . During those forty years that concern has grown even stronger . Our actual experience with courts covers the same length of time . The latest of many court surveys conducted by the Women 's City Club was made during the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-two visits to the Home Term of Magistrates ' Court , Domestic Relations Court , Court of Special Sessions and the Supreme Court . Our members include lawyers , social service workers , assistant district attorneys and judges with long experience in the courts . Through jury service or other personal experience many additional members know at first hand the often tragic hardship created by delayed justice resulting from fragmentation of jurisdiction , congested calendars and inadequate staffs . The Tweed commission plan would certainly alleviate these situations . The Women 's City Club , therefore , appeals to all who . are interested in justice to support the plan vigorously and urges the Legislature Ito make possible a referendum of the voters on the admirable plan presented by the Tweed commission . JULIET M. BARTLETT , President . JANET F. KLEIN , Chairman , Youth and the Law Committee . New York , Feb. 8 , 1957 . Soviet Brutality Charged To THE EDITO .. OF THE Nmv Yon ' : Russian soldiers captured Hungarian workers who were formerly free . Russian authorities transported them to Russia to forced labo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts are true . How is such action defined in the Communist breviary ? The Communists love to . apply the word " imperialism " to acts ' of other na- , tions , which are not half so brutal in motive or in result . Can a Communist ever define the word " imperialism " so that he will not condemn his own party 's actions , which speak louder than their words ? CHARLES G. MORRIS . New Haven , Conn. , Feb. 8 , 1957 . Moral Force of the U. N. To THE EDITOR OF " I:HE NEW YORK TIMES : Those people demanding specific proofs of the efficacy and strength of the United Nations should take note of the desperate plea in the letter by Thierry Maulnier published by The New York Times on Feb. 6 and quoted by many other papers . In its moving request that . the United States stand by France in the General Assembly , when France presents her plan for reconciliation with Algeria , one sees suddenly a true witness of the tremendous moral force which goes with approval ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it submitted for the judgment of the world . Decisions of the General Assembly take their power from the weight of world public opinion , since they are not legally binding upon the countries at which they axe aimed . In other words , member states have not promised that they will necessarily abide by the General **26;297;TOOLONG , as they have undertaken " to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council . " But the immense moral stress of the combined judgment of eighty nations is here so visibly to be reckoned with that it were idle to attempt to deny it . France has developed her own solution of the Algerian problem ? and would she have come to so liberal a one as this if she had not known that it must stand before the bar of world opinion for appraisal ? Maulnier , with the backing of French belief as exemplified in the support of French , Italian and Canadian papers , declares that for the United States to humiliate France before this world forum will be to France 's desperate undoing , No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see at this moment what power lies in that combination of forces , of national impulses , of diversified beliefs and of true arid honest wisdom which makes up the United Nations . CORNELIA MEIGS . Haverford , Pa. , Feb. 9 , 1957 . Future of Mental Patients Many Who Have Recovered Must Stay in Hospitals , It Is Charged To THE EDITOR oFTHENew York TIME11:1 One rather wonders just what is the purpose of the mental hospital .. Outside of the mentally ill , is it merely to provide bed and board for the homeless and helpless ? Patients who have recovered are unable to leave if there 19 no one to sign them out and give them a home until such time as they are readjusted to outside conditions and able to earn a living . It is downright cruelty to keep such people under , lock and key , with disturbed patients , for the rest of their lives . The monotony of such an existence is dreadful to contemplate . How long could people in perfect mental health endure such barbarity ? An excuse given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment , whereas it is well known that little or no treatm : : it ' can be given because of the scarcity. of doctors and the overwhelming , numbers in mental hospitals . Strangely enough , trigger-happy ' and other potentially dangerous male patients have been discharged in the care of relatives , later to make headlines by using firearms or committing murder in other . ways . We also find old people who are suffering from some form of senili-. ty , and have been placed in mental ? hospitals by selfish and ungrateful children . The highly successful Belgian . system , whereby patients are taken , into private homes in the town of Gheel , does not seem to have worked out to any appreciable extent in this country . Then , how about an institution ? . without bars  --  which could take in ? such homeless and recovered pa- ; tients ? Certain duties would be assigned to them , corresponding to their age or ability  --  a practical way of separating those desirous of improving their situation from the , lazy ones preferring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than work for a living . Work . is optional in a mental hospital , but . furnishes little Dr no incentive . Given a reason for living , many more cures would follow . Such an institution , besides free-. ing many beds for the very ill , could serve as an important step forward to the outside world . Many patients dread a return to their for-1 mer lives because of the stigma at- , tached to mental illness . L. LAMPERT . New York , Feb. 3 , 1957 . Naming of Conservation Aides To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I understand that some unthinking people , or at least some people who do not know me , have made the observation that the appointment of three assistant commissioners of conservation , one for lands and forests , one for fish and game , and one for administration , under my plan for the reorganization of this department will result in three political appointments and will provide three political plums , Nothing could be farther from the truth . The three assistant commissioners to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be career men in the Civil Service . These appointments very definitely will not be political appointments . I have already determined and decided that William M. Foss will become the assistant commissioner for lands and fore+ , and that Dr. W. Mason Lawrence will become the assistant commissioner for fish and game , with other Civil Service career men in this department moving up . In the reorganization of this department I shall recognize longterm service , ability and devotion to duty , and nothing else . SHARON J. MAMIE , Commissioner of Conservation , State of New York . Albany , Feb. 9 , 1957 . For Razing Carnegie Hall To THEEDITOR OFTHENew York TIMES I. Why do people continue to cry about Carnegie Hall ? The building itself is ugly outside as well as inside  --  architecture as well as barnred paint . The balcony is a fire trap . As far as acoustics go , there are some dead spots on the lower right in the orchestra . Up on the balcony , when the orchestra plays pianissimo and there is a traffic jam outside , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall or to the horns on Seventh Avenue . I believe the best thing that could happen to New York would be to get the new center on Lincoln Square , with an up-to-date concert hall . I hope they will call it " New Carnegie Hall " to preserve the name . ERNEST RUDINGER . New York , Feb. 8 , 1957.
