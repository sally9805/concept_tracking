Out of U.S. archives in Washington and " a final scraping of the barrel at the Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park , " the State Department last week released 43 more documents pertaining to the Yalta Conference of 1945 . The 43 documents did not add " significantly , " said State , to the Yalta record published earlier this year ( TIME , March 28 ) . But they did add some interesting new evidence of how some U.S. delegates comported and deluded themselves in the closing months of World War II , how they bartered principle for the illusion of postwar friendship with the Communists . <P> In the star document of the new series , Marshal Stalin brutally served notice upon President Franklin D. Roosevelt , five days before F.D.R. 's death , that cooperation was a myth , that all the Western concessions had been for naught . " Matters on the Polish question have really reached a dead end , " wrote Stalin . " Where are the reasons for it ? The reasons for it are that the ambassadors of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of the Crimea conference . " <P> Roosevelt 's Ambassador to Moscow , Averell Harriman , confirmed that the grand alliance was indeed crumbling , specifically , that the Russians would sanction no form of democratic government for Poland . " Every argument ... I advanced was brushed aside , " Harriman reported . " Aside from the major questions which are causing concern in our relations with the Soviet Union , there has been an accumulation of minor incidents . . . Little or no progress has been made in getting Soviet approval for our air teams to visit Soviet-controlled territory for appraisal of bomb damage , or for our naval team to inspect the port of Gdynia . Both proposals were agreed to at Yalta . " And so on , around the world , the 43 documents add to the background of the lost peace .
