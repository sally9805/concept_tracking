Airplanes are fast , but they use a lot of power to keep a payload in the air . Surface ships carry a lot of cargo , but water resistance keeps them slow . Last week Britain 's Saunders-Roe , Ltd. ( aircraft ) demonstrated a hybrid craft that is neither ship nor airplane , but has some of the advantages of both . Called the Hovercraft , it moves a little way above the surface of land or water , supported on a nearly frictionless cushion of air . <P> Saunders-Roe 's Hovercraft has a 30-ft. oval hull like an inverted platter . Sticking up from the center is a cylindrical housing for a 435-h.p. engine and a four-bladed fan . Air from the fan is blown down through two ring-shaped ducts under the rim of the hull , and emerges in jets that point inward , forming a kind of wall . Inside this wall a cushion of air builds up and lifts the Hovercraft off the surface . Forward propulsion is obtained by diverting part of the air flow through horizontal ducts ( see diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plant at Cowes , the Hovercraft rose 15 in. above the concrete runway . Test Pilot Peter Lamb maneuvered it easily , using a standard aircraft control stick . To dramatize the low friction of its air cushion , Inventor Christopher Cockrell pushed the four-ton craft around the apron by hand . Later the Hovercraft was towed out into the Solent for its first water trial . It rose in a cloud of spray and skimmed easily above the water among yachts and harbor traffic . <P> The next Hovercraft to be built , said Chief Designer Richard Stanton-Jones , will weigh 40 tons and carry 80 passengers at 100 m.p.h . Large Hovercraft should need only one-quarter the horsepower required by airplanes of comparable weight , and be able to carry twice the payload . They can start their voyages on land , require only a reasonably level shore . <P> Since even big Hovercraft will rise only a few feet above the water , they are bound to have trouble with waves . But the designers are not much worried . Most steep waves are low enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves are usually long and gradual ; they can be surmounted like a series of hills . Hovercraft can be designed with a seaworthy hull . In the worst storms they could drop down into the water and ride out the storm like any other vessel .
