txt Do n't count on that 25 per cent cut in the normal state income tax rate on earned income this year . Even though the Democratic majority in the Massachusetts House is ready to push through a measure continuing the tax cut granted in 1954 for one year only , the Senate is certain to reject the bill . The Republican - controlled Senate is expected to be responsive to the wishes of Governor Herter . The Governor already has pointed out the income tax cut can not be continued this year because of the precarious state of the commonwealth 's finances . $8.7 Million Involved Were the tax cut to become law for another year , it would result in a substantial deficit In state operations for the current fiscal year ending June 30 , 1955 . At least $8,700,000 in revenue is involved in the Democratic tax-cut . proposal . That is the figure submitted by William A. Schan , State Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation , to the Legislative Committee on Taxation , as a close estimate of the savings granted to the taxpayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 budget measure , Governor Herter estimated that  --  a general fund surplus of $3 , - 400,000 will be available at the end of the current fiscal year . On that basis if the tax cut were continued for another year it would result in a deficit of more than $5,000,000 . Governor Herter is counting on the estimated surplus to help meet growing state costs in the 1956 fiscal year opening July 1 , 1955 . Thus , if the surplus were turned into a deficit through continuation of the tax cut , the budget balancing for the new fiscal year would be considerably complicated . Temporary ' Taxes Actually balancing of the record-high $305,000,000 " minimum " state budget submitted for the July 1 , 1955 , fiscal year is predicated on continuation of the entire $81,000,000 in temporary taxes due to expire this year , unless renewed . Unless the budget is slashed by gigantic amounts , which would mean elimination of services many persons feel are essential , the temporary taxes must be continued or substitutes found for them . In the group of expiring temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earned income from 11/2 per cent to 21 , ' , per cent , first voted in 1951 on a two-year temporary basis , and renewed for two years in 1953 . When the tax boost was renewed in 1953 , Democrats sought to block it , even though the hike was first voted in 1951 by a Democratic-controlled House under Democratic Governor Dever . Admittedly Political Furthermore , when the 25 per cent reduction in the earned income rate was put through in 1954 for one year by the Herter administration the Democrats insisted the cut should be more , that the hike from 112 per cent to 21/2 should be repealed entirely . Thus their present maneuver is a followup to their 1953 and 1954 attempts . The purpose Is highly political , to embarrass the Herter administration and the Republican members of the House and Senate by forcing them to vote against a tax cut , a politically unpopular position . One Democratic House leader privately but frankly admitted the move was politically inspired . He also said if it were to become law it would throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
