MODERN architecture calls for outsize windows , yet neither artists nor architects have taken much advantage of this open invitation to stained-glass decoration . One notable exception : the 38-ft. - square window in St. Ann 's Church at Normandy , Mo . ( TIME , Dec. 15 ) . A standout example of stained glass out of church is Max Hunziker 's window for the Zurich Cantonal Hospital . Hunziker 's creation , more than 18 by 11 ft. , lights a spiral staircase leading to the hospital 's main auditorium . It will soon be complemented by another window on an opposite staircase . The themes of the two windows : " Water and Light " ( opposite ) and " Earth and Air . " <P> Max Hunziker , 51 , is an intense , self-taught artist whose chief love is Byzantine and Romanesque art . In his stained glass he tries to mirror the restrained magnificence of his anonymous idols . Restricting himself to 20 hues of glass-chosen from 15,000 commercially available-he assembles his windows with an artisan named Karl Ganz , then paints them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole job ( composing , assembling , painting , firing , leading ) takes up to three years , and only when the glass is finally installed can the artist see his work as a living entity , vibrating with the light of day . <P> In Hunziker 's " Water and Light " window , the ship at center right holds " a nameless group of suffering people who hope to travel upriver to well-being . " Along the winding course ahead are a doctor and patient , a family bathing , nurses drying a sheet before a fire , a good Samaritan carrying a patient across a bridge , and a shepherd with his flock . At the source of the stream a couple roams blissfully in the paradise they have found at journey 's end . In its quiet mixture of suffering , hope and joy , the window is altogether appropriate to the hospital setting . The wet light that falls through the colored glass is suggestive less of tears than of cleansing rain .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
