This is the time of the clean slate and the fresh start , the soaring spirits and the joyful tidings : Hoffmeister 's trick knee is like he never hurt it at all , Fink 's sore arm is as good as two years ago when he won 20 games , McShane , the fat catcher , has been dieting all winter and looks like a million . Add it all up , pal , let just a couple of those rookies come through , give us half a break with the pitching , and does n't it figure we 're up there  --  maybe all the way ? // This is the make-believe world of baseball 's spring training , and this week in the camps of 16 major league clubs ( four in Arizona , 12 in Florida ) it was being created all over again . Regardless of how the clubs finished in 1955 , there was nothing but high optimism everywhere  --  even in the camps of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Washington Senators , last year 's tailenders . Listening to the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been abolished by an act of Congress . Nobody expected to finish there . // It happens every springtime , and nobody exposed to it can resist it . Like a farm boy watching the circus posters being plastered on the barn , baseball men begin to feel the excitement long before the big show starts . They feel it in handling a thousand details of arrangement , all the tremendous trifles that must be dealt with before the curtain rises . // Take the St. Louis Cardinals , first club to pitch camp with enough big leaguers on hand to make it more than a rookie school . One recent afternoon Frank Lane , the Cards ' new general manager , stood staring out the window of his Busch Stadium office in St. Louis ' at the last vestige of the winter 's biggest snowstorm . An observer might decide , from the scowl on Lane 's face , that he was hatching in his mind one of the spectacular trades for which he is celebrated . The observer would be in error . For in a moment Lane turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his more positive declarations , he dictated the following telegram : // E. C. ROBISON , CHAIRMAN ST . PETERSBURG BASEBALL COMMITTEE ST . PETERSBURG , FLORIDA // AM VERY MUCH DISTURBED TO LEARN THAT CLUBHOUSE STILL WITHOUT HEAT . JUST WHAT CAN WE DO TO PROVIDE HEATING NECESSARY TO PREVENT HAVING LOT OF PLAYERS COMING UP WITH COLDS ? CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY HEATING CAN NOT BE PROVIDED AS NECESSARY . AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT OPEN SPACE BETWEEN SCOREBOARD AND PALM TREES RIGHT CENTER FIELD FENCE WHICH SHOULD HAVE GREEN CANVAS AS BATTER 'S BACKGROUND AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED . APPRECIATE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO , ROBBY . ARRIVING LATE SATURDAY NIGHT BUT 40 PLAYERS WILL BE IN EARLY SUNDAY MORNING . REGARDS . // FRANK C. LANE // The fever was beginning to mount elsewhere . That evening as he was about to sit down to dinner at his home in University City , a suburb of St. Louis , Leo Ward , traveling secretary of the Cardinals , was called to the telephone to take a call from Texarkana , Texas . The following conversation ensued : // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Charlie who ? " // " Charlie Purtle the pitcher ? With Ardmore in the Sooner State League ? You wrote me a letter to report at St. Petersburg ? " // " Oh yes , Charlie , how are you ? What can I do for you ? " // " Mr. Ward , would it be all right for me to take my wife and the baby to camp ? " // " Oh , sure , Charlie , that will be all right . " // " Well , now , how much money would I get , Mr. Ward ? " // " Your salary does n't start until the season opens , Charlie , but you 'll get expense money while you 're in training . " // " How much would that be , Mr. Ward ? " // " Well , Charlie , you get $6 a day for meals and $25 a week for incidentals . Do you plan to live at the hotel ? " // " We thought we 'd live in a motel , Mr. Ward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for housing , Charlie . In your case , it adds up to $98.50 a week , Charlie . " // " Oh , yeah . Well , then we 'll just drive to camp and look for a motel , and shall I call you when I get there , Mr. Ward ? " // " Do that , Charlie . " // " Okay . I sure do thank you , Mr. Ward . " // Putting down the phone , Ward checked his records to refresh his memory and read that Charles Ray Purtle , pitcher , born Sept. 5 , 1935 , height 6 feet , weight 170 , had won 22 games , lost 11 , with Ardmore , Oklahoma in 1955 , was scheduled this year to advance to Allentown , Pa. in the Class A Eastern League . // Back at the ball park , Butch Yatkeman , the clubhouse man who started with the Cardinals as batboy 30 years ago , saw the last of the trunks containing uniforms and other equipment ( the players furnish only their gloves and shoes ) loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with medical supplies packed by Trainer Bob Bauman . Then both Yatkeman and Bauman went home to start packing their own bags . // Two days later Yatkeman , Bauman , Ward and Ned Mitchell , a railroad man , were having breakfast together at the Morrison Cafeteria in St. Petersburg , Florida , and Ward was saying carefully : " I 've got the feeling that this ball club can go all the way . I 've got the same feeling I had in 1942 when we were 10 ? games behind in August and then went all the way to win . " // After breakfast Ward went to Al Lang Field , the ball park named for the former mayor of St. Petersburg who is known as " Florida 's father of spring training " ( he persuaded Branch Rickey to bring the St. Louis Browns to Florida in 1914 ) . Ward looked up John Blair , the clubhouse man and grounds-keeper , and was assured that a new gas heater was being installed . Blair added that Al Lang himself was out in center field with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , the superintendent of parks , discussing the open space in the center field wall that Frank Lane had sent the wire about . Ward went to join them . // As Ward approached , Al Lang , now 85 and bearing a strong resemblance to his friend , the late Connie Mack , turned and saw him and let out a whoop . " Oh , my , " he cried , " who left the gate open ! Look who got in ! " // Ward walked up and said , " I do n't want any trouble with you this year , Uncle Al ! " // Lang quickly applied a headlock to Ward and began mussing his hair . " Oh , my , " he exclaimed , " look at that bald spot ! Oh , ai n't his hair coming out lovely though ! " // Freeing himself , Ward greeted the others and then turned back to Al Lang : " What 's going to be done about the open space up there ? " // Before Robison or Hill could say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bunk ! I never heard of any good hitters complaining about that open space . Nobody complains but the Alibi Ikes who ca n't hit the size of their hats ! Those are the guys who keep complaining about little things like that . Now look here , Leo , when we built this park I gave my solemn word to the people of this neighborhood that we 'd do nothing to obstruct their view of the water . No canvas can go up there if I 'm going to keep my word . " // Ward put his hands on his hips and looked at Lang . " Uncle Al , " he said , " I heard you gave $100,000 to the orphanage here last week . " // Lang hung his head . // " And I thought , " Ward went on , " that you had reformed . But I see that you 're just as ornery as ever . " // Lang raised his head happily and declared : " Yes , I am ! " // The amenities concluded , the four men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transplant some trees that would close in the gap that worried Frank Lane and at the same time preserve Al Lang 's promise to the neighbors. // Ward went back to the Bainbridge Hotel and ordered the refrigerator in room 218 , the press room , stocked with cold cuts , cheese and Budweiser beer . Then he took possession of suite 312 for the Cardinal offices and hired a local girl as secretary and put her to work preparing the first expense checks that would be distributed to the players after the first workout. // Later in the afternoon the phone rang in Ward 's room . The caller was Charlie Purtle , the pitcher from Texarkana . He had arrived , found a motel , did n't know exactly where it was . He put the landlady on the phone , and she gave the street address and also said that the Purtles were a fine young couple and that she would take good care of them . Ward thanked her very much . // Next morning , spring training day minus one , Ward was having breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with curly black hair walked slowly up to the table . He looked like perfect casting for a western movie hero . He introduced himself to Ward as Fred Hutchinson . This was the new Cardinal manager , the onetime Detroit pitcher ( and manager ) who had won the Pacific Coast League pennant at Seattle last year . Hutchinson accepted Ward 's invitation to sit down and have a cup of coffee and then he inquired about the heater and the open space in center field . Ward reassured him on both points . // Meanwhile , at the clubhouse , Butch Yatkeman finished distributing uniforms in the lockers and placed a carton of Beechnut chewing gum on the desk in Manager Hutchinson 's office . Then he posted a mimeographed roster which listed among the players " Gussie Busch the club owner , outfielder. 1955 club  --  Pestalozzi . " Pestalozzi is a street in St. Louis on which a number of the Anheuser-Busch brewery buildings stand . // That evening , outside Hotel Bainbridge , it suddenly seemed that everybody was there : coaches Johnny Hopp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great infielder retained as a special instructor ; Walker Cooper , the catcher of the famous brother team , on the active list at 41 ; Joe Mathes , the chief scout ; Walter Shannon , supervisor of minor league personnel ; confident big leaguers like Ken Boyer laughing it up and slapping a coach on the back ; deferential bushers standing around and taking it all big . There was speculation over a cloudy sky that could provide a dreadful anticlimax by postponing the first workout. // A NEW MANAGER SPEAKS // But the sun was shining in the morning and at 12 o'clock the uniformed players ( Charlie Purtle of Texarkana wearing No. 81 ) sat on the benches in the clubhouse and listened to Manager Fred Hutchinson 's low-pressure remarks . Apologizing for any names he might mispronounce , Hutchinson read off the roster ( he had quite a bit of trouble with Dick Czekaj , a catcher ) and then explained that there would be one three-hour workout a day . " Do n't overdo it right away , " he said , " and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , go ahead and throw curve balls if you want . You 're going to have sore arms anyway ; might as well get it over with . Just remember , all of you , you 're here for a reason . " Hutchinson looked around and then turned to Trainer Bauman : " You got anything to say , Bob ? " // Bauman got up and said . " Well , I 'll just say this  --  do n't neglect blisters . A little merthiolate on a blister today may prevent a bad infection later on . I guess that 's all I 've got to say right now . " // Hutchinson then introduced his coaches and explained their assignments , and at 12:25 he said , " Well , let 's go . " The players filed out of the clubhouse and up the green walk over the bleacher wall and down onto the field . As their spikes dug into the grass , they broke into a trot and big league baseball 's spring training was officially on for the 1956 season . // At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane , the general manager , and after a minute 85-year-old Al Lang took a stance at the plate and shouted , " Oh , my , I 'm ready right now  --  Frank Lane , you tell Schoendienst he 'll have to move over ; put me down for second base ! " Then he suddenly clapped a hand to his forehead and cried , " Oh , I forgot ! Do n't you expect me to hit so good , Frank Lane ! Oh , no , not until you get that open space fixed up in center field ! " // " Pepper games ! " yelled Fred Hutchinson suddenly , and the jogging players headed for the bats and balls . As the familiar sounds of wood on horse-hide rose over the field for the first time , somebody in the grandstand bit into the first hot dog of the spring season , and at home plate the group of privileged observers began to drift to the sidelines , and soon the familiar virus was at work on them . Somebody had the word that Red Schoendienst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regulars a little later ) had been taking eye exercises all winter and now was enjoying perfect vision . Another had late information to the effect that Pitcher Frank Smith , bothered with a sore arm last year , was in such terrific shape that he could throw a ball through a wood plank , loosely speaking . How , exploded a club man , could you do anything but upgrade the pitching with Wilmer ( Vinegar Bend ) Mizell back from the service , and Harvey Haddix , just on the law of averages alone , due for a great year after a below-par 12-and-16 record in 1955 ? Just use a little plain arithmetic , demanded the Schoendienst eye man , and what have you got ? You got great youngsters like Ken Boyer , Bill Virdon , Wally Moon and Alex Grammas with a year 's , two years ' major league experience behind them . On top of all that , you got a new manager who is bound to get the most out of his pitchers because he was a pitcher himself ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartest men in the business , look what he did with the White Sox  --  and , man , does n't it begin to figure ? // Frank Lane modestly withdrew to a spot of shade . Looking ruggedly youthful ( at 60 ) in his sports jacket and open-collared shirt , he shook his head . // " I 've got to fight it , " he said slowly , " I 'm just as vulnerable to the high spirits around a training camp as anybody else . But , as general manager of this club , I 've got to be realistic and look at the hard facts . Now , some people have said that last season the Cardinals were the greatest seventh-place ball club in history . Well , maybe I 'd rather have the lousiest first-place ball club in history . " // He knelt down and pulled out a blade of grass and nibbled at it . He stood up and thrust his hands in his pockets and spoke more forcefully . // " We 've got a great manager in Fred Hutchinson  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told Mr. Busch when I nominated Hutchinson , I said , ' Mr. Busch , you can be sure that any manager I pick will be the best man for Frank Lane . ' That 's the way I look at Fred Hutchinson. // " But , as I say , a general manager ca n't let himself be carried away . Of course , there 's no point in glossing over the fact that we 've got some terrific young talent here . Now , in the normal course of development , these boys are infinitely better for this season . But what I sense in this camp , to a degree that I 've rarely seen in all my years in baseball , is an attitude , a great attitude . That 's the big thing if you 're playing ball , preaching a sermon or selling shoes . It 's the attitude that counts . " // He seemed to be breathing a little faster now . // " But I 've got to be realistic , as I said . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to say we 're going to beat out Brooklyn and Milwaukee . " // The new boss of the best seventh-place club in history looked across the infield at the sun-drenched panorama of young athletes throwing and hitting and fielding against a background of gently swaying palm trees and the blue waters of Tampa Bay . He opened his mouth and almost blurted something . Then he caught himself and by a great effort forced himself to face the hard facts of the National League race for 1956 : // " The Cardinals , " said Frank Lane , the realist , " will finish third . "
