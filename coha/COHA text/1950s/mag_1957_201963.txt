Short days after the Eisenhower Administration came into office , a spike-haired young man named Robert Walter Scott McLeod clattered through the marble corridors of the State Department like a broncobuster . A onetime ( 1942-49 ) FBI agent and former administrative assistant to New Hampshire 's Senator Styles Bridges , McLeod was brought in to direct the State Department 's security " cleanup " program , and he quickly kicked up a dust that never quite settled . Last week the dust blew and the epithets flew anew as President Eisenhower nominated Scott McLeod to be U.S. Ambassador to Ireland . <P> Scott McLeod 's job was an ugly , thankless one to begin with , and he was bound to stir up enemies . As Dulles ' top security officer , it was his duty to rid the department of the soft-on-Communism reputation that had built up during the Acheson regime . But by plunging in with McCarthy-like zeal , McLeod alienated good guys and bad guys alike . Moreover , he seemed to be in some initial doubt about whether his primary loyalty was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The matter came to a head when McLeod , going over Dulles ' head to the White House , sought to block the appointment of Charles E. ( " Chip " ) Bohlen as Ambassador to Moscow . <P> Gradually Scott McLeod and the State Department got broken to each other , and McLeod was credited with a good job of administering the department 's security and emergency refugee-relief programs . Today , inside the department , there is a grudging admission that McLeod , with his friendly personality and lively sense of humor , will make a creditable ambassador . Said a top State Department officer last week : " McLeod has learned a lot about the rules of the game and about international relations since he came here . He 'll probably do a better job in Dublin than many people who might be picked from private life . " <P> Outsiders were not so charitable . President Eisenhower made it crisply clear at his press conference , that he had nominated McLeod only on Dulles ' recommendation . And editorial writers debated the justice of the appointment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times : " It would be hard to imagine a worse blow to the diplomatic corps . " Replied the New York Daily News : The fact that " all of the nation 's anti-anti-Communists . . . and phony liberals are in full bellow against the nomination ... is reason enough for the Senate to confirm , unanimously . " <P> Just as the President characterized the McLeod nomination as State Department business , State last week cocked a quizzical eye at an ambassadorial choice made directly by Ike . The nominee , to replace Career Foreign Service Officer Frances E. Willis as Ambassador to Switzerland : Henry J. ( for Junior ) Taylor , 54 , of Charlottesville , Va . Lifelong Republican Taylor is an independently wealthy businessman ( Chairman Silicone Paper Co. of America , Inc. ) and sometime author ( Men in Motion , Men and Power ) , who switched to journalism on the eve of World War II . During the war he specialized in the " big picture , " covered headquarters closely , became friendly with General Eisenhower and other top brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Generals ' Ernie Pyle.
