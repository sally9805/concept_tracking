Most Japanese had never heard of the sport called skiing until 1902 , when 200 Nipponese soldiers were lost in winter maneuvers on the snow-covered slopes of Mount Hakkota , and the Japanese Minister to Sweden rushed a shipment of Swedish skiing equipment back to his native land for rescue work . In the succeeding decades , the Japanese began to get the hang of the herringbone climb and the Christiania turn , and skiing became one of Japan 's top winter sports . Last week , Japan 's skiers staged a big two-day national ski meet . The ski-happy Japanese hauled 50 freight cars full of fresh snow out of chilly northern Niigata and , as shown here , heaped it atop a huge ski jump in balmy Tokyo 's Korakuen stadium . The Transportation Ministry and a local newspaper , which sponsored the meet and paid for the snow , lost only 959,950 yen ( $2,667 ) on the event .
