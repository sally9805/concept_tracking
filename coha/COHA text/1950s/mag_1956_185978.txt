Precocious Novelist Franchise Sagan , 21 , is probably France 's most successful export to the U.S. since French fried potatoes and Chanel No. 5 . Her neat , sentimentally acid little accounts of old-hearted juveniles and middle-aged delinquents were widely cheered by the critics , eagerly bought by the customers . Still on the bestseller list after 16 weeks is A Certain Smile ( TiME , Aug. 20 ) , a thin quadrangle story about an ever-so-wise teenager , her ever-so-world-weary lover , the lover 's all-understanding wife and the girl 's rather sappy boy friend . In Harper 's Bazaar , witty Playwright Jean Kerr ( wife of New York Drama Critic Walter Kerr ) gets a lot of certain laughs out of A Certain Smile , in a spoof that expresses the quintessence of Saganism : <P> Banal and I were classmates . Our eyes had met , our bodies had met , and then someone introduced us . . . A stranger across the booth spoke . " Monique , what are you staring at , silly girl ? " It was Banal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew why . A revolting look of cheerfulness had twisted and distorted those clear young features until he seemed actually to be smiling . . . <P> His voice followed me , humbly and at a distance like a spaniel . " Monique , why did you skip class ? We were studying the Critique of Pure Reason . It was interesting , but I think Kant offers a false dichotomy . The only viable solution is to provide a synthesis in which experience is impregnated with rationality and reason is ordained to empirical data . " <P> How like Banal to say the obvious . . . Why must we chatter fruitlessly and endlessly about philosophy and politics ? I confess that I am only interested in questions that touch the heart of another human being- " Who are you sleeping with ? " ; " What do you take for quick relief from acid indigestion ? " <P> Banal 's voice droned on like a chorus of cicadas on a hot day until finally there was a statement I could n't ignore . " Monique , I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' A slight , stooped man came toward me . He was no longer middleaged , but I liked that . I was so tired of these eager boys of 50 . His hair , which was greenish white , might have been unpleasant had there been more of it . As he smiled gently , showing his small , even , ecru teeth , I thought , " Ah , he 's the type that 's mad for little girls . " In fact , had n't I read that he 'd had some trouble with the police ? . . . <P> I realized with a sudden stab of joy that finally I had met a man who was as bored as I was . . . Now Banal was speaking , in his infantile way . " Do you know Monique has never seen the sea ? " Then a woman spoke , Anatole 's wife . " Why , that 's awful that this poor child has never seen the sea . Anatole , darling , you must take her to our little chateau by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 'm redecorating the town house . But there is plenty of food in the frigidaire , and Monique will be able to see the ocean from the bedroom . Here are the keys . " I liked her for that . . . <P> We were in Anatole 's open car . Overhead the sky was blue as a bruise . Anatole 's voice seemed to come from a great distance : " Bored , darling ? " I turned to him . " Of course-and you ? " His answering smile told me that he was .
