txt  | that was to produce an entirely new and extremely important development in the lamp business . Their names were Franklin S. Terry and Burton G. Tremaine . TERRY AND TREMAINE Both these men were in their late thirties in 1901 , and both were experienced businessmen . Terry had been in the lamp business in and around Chicago since 1890 as president of the Sunbeam Incandescent Lamp Co . Tremaine conducted an insurance and realestate business in Cleveland , beginning in 1884 , and became interested in lamp manufacturing in 1889 . At that time he helped to organize the Fostoria Incandescent Lamp Co. at Fostoria , Ohio . His cousin , H. A. Tremaine , was associated with him in this venture . Other officers of the company were J. B. Crouse and J. Robert Crouse , father and son . The group also owned a glass factory ? the Fostoria Bulb and Bottle Co . The Crouses and H. A. Tremaine had previously managed a carbon business , making carbons for arc lamps , which they had sold out to the National Carbon Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enthusiastic business idealist , spent much of his time in 1900 and early 1901 considering the situation of his own lamp company and the others like it . There were more than 30 small manufacturers in the country . They all needed better research , better engineering , and more working capital . Without more strength in all these departments they could not make lamps that equaled the products of the leaders on such vital points as efficiency and uniformity . Fired by the conception of a group of companies cooperating for the benefit of all , Terry went to call on the men at Fostoria . In a long discussion with B. G. Tremaine , he won support . Together the two men worked out the plan . By bringing together a number of the smaller companies , they reasoned , they could establish an engineering department that would serve all the lamp factories in the group . This department would have much better staff and equipment than any single small  | company could maintain as an engineering section . It could conduct basic lamp research and development ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines ; it could offer a " trouble-shooting " service for any affiliated lamp factory that might be struggling with production problems . All the factories would contribute to the maintenance of the engineering department . In turn , all of them would benefit by its facilities ? not on a mandatory basis , but on request from the factory managers , if and when they desired such assistance . This cardinal principle came primarily from Terry 's thinking . He wanted to build a central organization , but he was firmly opposed to centralized control . This sounded paradoxical but it was not . Terry 's idea was that a headquarters group should serve the factory managers , the sales staffs in the field , and the other workers in all departments who best understood the local problems they faced . So the plan included sales and advertising counsel , credit systems , accounting and financial advice as well as engineering ? all on the same basis of service rather than dictation . Tremaine 's temperament and abilities offset Terry 's intense enthusiasm . His practical nature balanced Terry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manner provided the needed foil for the crusading spirit he found in Terry . Together they made a formidable team as they set out to persuade other lampmakers throughout the country to join them . Before long they confirmed the principal fear they had entertained about their proposal : it would take capital ? a good deal more money than they could raise in their immediate circle of associates . Several factory owners to whom they talked saw merit in the plan but felt that they would be giving up their business sovereignty if they accepted it . If so , they would rather sell their businesses to a new and larger company , if Terry and Tremaine wished to start one . They might be willing to run their manufacturing and sales activities as part of such a company . Terry could talk as much as he liked about the service arrangements he would set up in Cleveland , but they had their doubts . They had seen  | other examples of centralized control . Now if the two gentlemen had the capital to buy out the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not all the manufacturers clung to this viewpoint . A few were willing to contribute , as affiliates , to the engineering organization in return for its obvious benefits . But it was clear that if a strong group were to be built , there would have to be funds to purchase quite a few existing companies . Throughout their preliminary planning Terry and Tremaine had felt that their new organization must maintain friendly relations with General Electric . For one thing , General Electric held important patents on lamps and machinery . It would help the new group tremendously to have the right to utilize some of those patents . They knew something of Charles A. Coffin 's business philosophy and believed that he might be favorable to their ideas . Coffin believed very deeply in competition aimed at producing the highest possible quality of product throughout the industry . He applied this belief to the operations of various departments of General Electric . One G-E plant rnight be making a product that , in effect , competed with the product of another of the company 's factories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to best each other . Each should keep improving quality ; both products should be constantly tested competitively , just as though they were produced under separate ownership . The same spirit , he thought , should permeate the respective sales staffs and all other employee groups . Also , let competing companies ( such as Sunbeam , Fostoria , and all the other lamp manufacturers ) keep trying to improve quality of product and all phases of business operation . That would stimulate his own men to keep doing the same . It was this broad-scale attitude that led Terry and Tremaine toward an unprecedented step in solving their main problem : they would ask General Electric to put up the money for their federation plan ! Today this seems like a curious and quixotic idea . To top it off , Terry and Tremaine intended to withdraw from the new company if G.E . could be persuaded to provide capital . Both of them ? Tremaine in particular ? were interested in the possibilities of another infant industry , the manufacture of automobiles.  | They felt that their plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electric would seek to control it in detail . Therefore , as soon as it was organized and operating , they would leave the lamp industry and go into the automobile business . Tremaine had already selected an automobile company and a location for this purpose . ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LAMP COMPANY J. B. Crouse first approached Coffin on behalf of the Terry ? Tremaine ? Crouse group . Their preliminary conversation progressed favorably . Coffin approved the men sponsoring the plan . He had dealt with Crouse and H. A. Tremaine in their carbon business , and liked them . Crouse arranged a second meeting in which Terry and B. G. Tremaine made a complete presentation . Coffin showed no hesitancy in accepting . General Electric would finance the formation of a new company . However , the G-E president astonished the others by insisting on two major conditions : ( 1 ) Tremaine and Terry must remain as the active managers of the new organization , and ( 2 ) they were to have complete management authority and responsibility , with General Electric taking no part whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remain essentially a silent partner . One other requirement was that the new company would purchase and take over as its headquarters the Brush Electric Co. plant on East 45th Street in Cleveland , a General Electric property . Delighted by the free hand they were to have , Terry and Tremaine agreed to Coffin 's terms just as readily as he had specified them . On May 3 , 1901 , they organized the National Electric Lamp Co . Capitalization was composed of $5oo,000 in common stock , $15o,000 in preferred stock , and $2,000,000 in bonds . General Electric purchased 75 per cent of the common stock and held an option to buy the remainder . Terry and Tremaine set out to form their federation of subsidiary companies and affiliates . To start with , of course , they had the Sunbeam and Fostoria companies . Within a few months they  | had added three companies that had been members of the Incandescent Lamp Manufacturers Association ? Bryan-Marsh , Columbia , and Buckeye . Then they went on the road to sell others on enlisting under the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little appearance of high-pressure salesmanship . They called on the head of a company , asked how he was getting along , and discussed the problems of lamp production . They made no offers . After a while the company president grew restive . Usually he said : " Gentlemen , I think I know why you 're here . It 's not just to have a pleasant conversation about the lamp business . Are n't you going to make an offer to buy our company ? " " If you want to sell , " was the reply , " we might very well be interested . But we are not urging you nor making any offers . It 's entirely up to you . " In most cases the discussion then turned to a detailed offer of sale and the terms of purchase . Terry and Tremaine explained their proposed method of operation . This included the continued manufacture of the individual company 's product ( for example , Shelby lamps made by the Shelby Electric Co. ) and usually the retention of the same management personnel as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men assembled the companies they wanted to affiliate with National . The preferred stock and the bonds of the new corporation were issued to the stockholders of the various individual companies in payment for their businesses . On several occasions Tremaine and Terry returned to General Electric for approval on expanding the capitalization to assure the purchase of desirable lamp companies . But one point that should be noted about this series of transactions was this : Aside from the top members of the National group and a few executives of G.E . and the Edison Lamp Works , no one knew of General Electric 's financial interest in National . By 1904 the National lamp system had become a well-rounded operation . In Cleveland the Development Laboratory and the Engineering Department offered research and testing services to the individual factories . In the same way , a Business Development  | section helped the member companies improve their marketing methods . Representatives of the Engineering Department visited each factory once a month , with no advance notice . They selected lamps at random from the regular run and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test findings on all samples of lamps , but with only their own lamps identified as to results . The factory with the lowest average product-quality rating had to pay the largest share per lamp to support the Engineering Department operations . The others were also assessed according to the merits of their lamps . This naturally served as an incentive to improve each brand ? and the lamps were still produced and marketed under their earlier brand names : Peerless , Packard , Colonial , Shelby , Sunbeam , Sterling , Banner , Fostoria , Buckeye , Bryan-Marsh , Columbia , and others . More than 20 companies joined the federation at one time or another . In 1906 the name " National Electric Lamp Association " ( Nela ) was adopted for the entire group . ( This was not the same as the National Electric Light Association , the members of which were principally electric-utility companies . ) With Terry and Tremaine as leaders , the National company soon became a potent force in the lamp business . The members of the Nela group held licenses under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineering Department , the license agreements worked in both directions ? that is , G.E . was entitled to licenses on National developments . And the skilled craftsmen in the new company began to contribute their share of the improvements in machines and methods . The result was a free exchange of technical information between General Electric and National . The National group held frequent meetings in Cleveland during its first few years . The factory managers , sales managers , and other leaders discussed common problems and became better acquainted . They kept making progress in the quality and volume of their lamp production . Not only were their sales climbing , but they were also developing a spirit of cooperation and camaraderie unmatched anywhere else in the industry .  | The plant on East 45th Street began to be uncomfortably crowded because of the growing business volume . National built additions and leased nearby buildings , but these too became inadequate . F. S. Terry , worrying over this problem , realized that the company would soon have to build new facilities . He did not favor a downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and different kind of site for the headquarters of the business . The entire industry was taking shape as an important factor in American life . Millions more were becoming familiar with the convenience of electric light . As National grew , so did General Electric and Westinghouse . The lamp industry was booming ? coming of age like a young man just turned 2I.  | Research Develops Strikingly Better Lamps AS THE WORLD turned into the twentieth century , a great sense of anticipation and hope permeated the United States . This was nowhere more apparent than in the realms of science and industry . The horseless carriage was beginning to become an automobile . In hundreds of small workshops , set up with crude equipment , mechanics and inventors were busy . They were experimenting with ideas that they hoped might develop into whole new industries . However , there was little industrial research along the lines familiar to us today . Development and testing laboratories , as such , were few and far between . As for a genuine scientific laboratory in industry , there was none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function ? without specific relation , in many cases , to the development of a product . American universities did not have adequate laboratories in this sense , either . They were just beginning to see the possibilities , just beginning to assemble the men and equipment , to start in a small way the work for which they had previously looked to Europe . At Lynn , Elihu Thomson directed General Electric 's development laboratory . It was a good one , but it was concerned with product development only ? not the seeking of new principles in the field of electricity . The company 's illuminating-engineering laboratory , established in Schenectady in 1899 , dealt principally  | Industrialists generally did not feel that research laboratories were within the scope of their business functions . They did n't even think of it . If anyone had suggested such an idea , almost all of them would have turned it down as a waste of money . Nevertheless , in 1900 several leaders of General Electric , acting as a group , conceived the idea of establishing such a laboratory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative , and in later years they all shared it . Thomson was one of them . Another was E. W. Rice , vice-president and technical director of the company . The others were Charles P. Steinmetz , the consulting engineer , and A. G. Davis , manager of the Patent Department . When these four discussed their suggestion informally with President Coffin , they received immediate support . Coffin with his broad vision was able to perceive the possibilities of the laboratory . He had confidence in his colleagues . He knew that nothing of the kind was available in the American academic world , and he saw no reason why General Electric should not try it . So it was that in the fall of 1900 the first laboratory for fundamental research in American industry was established in Schenectady . The beginnings were humble enough . The first quarters for the laboratory were set up in a barn behind the house in which Steinmetz was living . To take charge of the work , Rice hired a young man who was engaged in teaching and research work in chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney . Whitney was hesitant about accepting the position . He was occupied with interesting problems at M.I.T. and was naturally a bit skeptical about how much latitude he might find for basic scientific research in an industrial organization . However , when Rice proposed a division of time between the company and the university , Whitney accepted . This arrangement remained in effect for three years . At the end of that time Whitney no longer doubted the value of the projects originated at Schenectady nor the working freedom that he and his staff would enjoy . Laurence A. Hawkins has told the story of the General Electric Research Laboratory from 1900 to 1950 in his book , " Adventure into the Unknown . " It is a definitive history and an intimate one  | because of Mr. Hawkins 's many active years in various management capacities in the laboratory . Anyone interested in the accomplishments of the laboratory , ranging through many fascinating fields from lighting to metallurgy , electronics , and atomic power , should read the Hawkins book . As Hawkins points out , it was Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he who built and equipped the laboratory , selected and trained its staff , and provided incomparable leadership for more than 30 years . At the start Whitney was the entire laboratory himself . The first of his assistants was J. T. H. Dempster , who had worked with Steinmetz earlier . In 1901 the laboratory was installed in a small frame building within the Schenectady Works . By 1904 Whitney 's staff had grown to 12 persons ; the personnel , the quarters , and the necessary equipment continued to grow steadily after that time . The early advisory council of the laboratory consisted of Rice , Whitney , Thomson , Steinmetz , Davis , and John W. Howell , engineer of the Edison Lamp Works . Others soon appointed to this group of advisors were John E. Randall , engineer of the National Lamp Works , and C. W. Stone and William Stanley , outstanding consulting engineers with the company . SEARCHING FOR BETTER FILAMENTS One of the first lines of investigation pursued by the laboratory was the basic examination of the nature of incandescent lamps and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or might be used . The research laboratory was independent of the lamp end of the business or any other department . However , its facilities could be used to study any problem that might later affect any of the production departments . The carbon-filament lamp had apparently reached the peak of its efficiency by the early 19oo 's . Up to that time Edison and others had improved its life and its light output , but by 1900 Edison was reported to believe that the incandescent lamp was not likely to be notably improved further . Toward the close of the nineteenth century , experimenters in  | lamp design , especially in Europe , began to try to find ways to exceed the performance of carbon lamps by utilizing other filament materials . They were aided in this research by the development of the electric-arc furnace , which made it possible to get higher temperatures for studying the properties of metals and other chemical substances . In 1897 Dr. Walther Nernst developed a new lamp with an initial efficiency of 5 lumens per watt ( as compared with 3.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German professor of marked ability who was later ( 1920 ) to win the Nobel prize in chemistry . As the burner for his lamp he used various metallic oxides mixed together and formed into a tiny rod . Lane-Fox and Edison , among others , had suggested earlier the use of such materials as illuminants , but Nernst was the first to pursue work along these lines to a commercially useful conclusion . The Nernst lamp , however , was awkward to handle , complicated , and expensive . A special heating coil of platinum wire had to be employed with it to preheat the metallic-oxide burner , which would not conduct electricity when cold . In spite of improvements made by others to whom Nernst assigned patent rights , his invention could not supplant the carbon lamp for most uses . George Westinghouse purchased the American rights to the Nernst lamp patents . The lamp 's efficiency gained it considerable sales , particularly in Europe , from 1902 through 1911 . Other and more efficient lamps came on the market during those years , so before long the Nernst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among those more efficient lamps were further developments from central Europe . One was the osmium lamp , using the rare metal of that name for a filament . This was contrived by Carl von Welsbach , the Austrian who had invented the Welsbach mantle for gas lighting . During his experiments from 1897 to 1900 , Welsbach devised new methods of treatment so that the fragile metal could be formed into filaments ( by squirting an osmium paste through dies ) . Initial efficiency was 5.5 lumens per watt . The rated lamp  | life was good : 1,000 hours . But again there were drawbacks : osmium was costly because of its rarity ; it was brittle ; very long filaments were necessary . Few customers were willing to pay $1 to $2 for the lamp . The American patent rights , applied for in 1898 , were not approved until 1910 . Therefore , the lamp was never manufactured commercially in the United States . Technicians of the Siemens and Halske Company in Germany , profiting by the earlier research in metal filaments , developed the tantalum lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in limited supply and very expensive , possessed advantages over osmium in workability . Again , long filaments ( 2 feet or more ) were necessary . Initial light output of these lamps was 5 lumens per watt and life ranged up to about Boo hours . First produced commercially in 1905 , tantalum lamps were introduced to the United States market by General Electric and National in 1906 . The two companies had purchased the American rights . For about six years the lamps were sold with some success , especially for use on direct-current circuits , where the lamp life was much more satisfactory than on alternating-current circuits . Alternating current caused the tantalum filament to crystallize rapidly , resulting in early failure . This factor , of course , placed a definite limit on the market for the lamps , since most of the current supplied in this country was alternating . THE GEM LAMP The foregoing discussion of the Nernst , osmium , and tantalum lamps is not detailed because the lamps themselves are not particularly interesting to the general reader . They show , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the early years of the century , and point up the comparable work of the General Electric Research Laboratory during that time . Throughout his long career Dr. Whitney has always possessed to the utmost degree a passion for basic experiment in attacking any scientific problem . Rather than accept an easy assumption that  | seems obvious , he insists firmly on beginning at the beginning . He would agree with another great scientist 's maxim : the " obvious " is often incorrect . Characteristically , then , his approach to the problem of lamp research was to examine the carbon lamp thoroughly and to say , in effect : " Let 's see what we have here . How does it act ? What are its strong points , and what are its weaknesses ? Having examined those , we shall know what factors to study ( or restudy ) basically in chemistry and physics . We 'll learn more about them and perhaps ? who knows ? ? we may be able to improve lamp design as a result . This will not preclude the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact aid that study . " Of course this is not a unique attitude in science . But many others would have assumed that the carbon filament could not be further improved in any way , and that there was no point in studying the existing lamp before plunging into the search for other filament materials . The bulbs blackened during their lives , and Dr. Whitney knew that this was an effect of evaporation of carbon from the filament . He believed that this darkening of the bulb might be due in considerable measure to the presence of certain ash oxides ( such as silica ) in the filament . These oxides could not be eliminated at the temperatures , and with the conditions , under which the filaments operated nor those under which they were normally treated by the " flashing " process . ( The operating temperature up to that time was about 1700 ? C. The highest treatment temperature used in the making of the filaments was about 2700 ? C. ) What would happen ? how would the filaments react ? under higher temperatures ? Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had to construct a new type of electricresistance furnace . In the highly heated carbon tube used in this furnace , he could get temperatures of about 3Soo ? C. After heating a batch of filaments in his furnace , he used them in lamps and tested them . The results were surprisingly good . Several further tests , taking into account other factors , repeated the original success .  | There were several beneficial results from the electric-furnace treatment . The ash oxides were reduced materially , as Whitney had anticipated . This lessened blackening of the bulb during the useful lamp life . The operating temperature could be increased to about 19oo ? C , as compared to the previous 1700 ? level . The reason for this was that the treated coating of the filament ? a graphite " shell " created by the high heat ? became much harder and tougher as a result of the higher temperatures reached in the electric furnace . The filament took on the characteristics of a metal filament : instead of lower electrical resistance occurring as operating temperatures were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output . Because of these changes in the filament characteristics , the lamp was called Gem ( General Electric Metallized ) . Gem lamps operated at 25 per cent higher efficiency than regular carbon lamps over the same useful life ? 600 hours . When designed for this rated life , the initial output of Gem lamps was 4.25 lumens per watt , compared to 3.4 1pw for carbon lamps . If the Gem lamp were operated at the same efficiency ( light output ) as the regular carbon lamp , it would last 4% times as long . Dr. Whitney made his patent application on the Gem lamp in February , 1904 , and the patent was granted in 1909 . General Electric placed the lamps on the market in 1905 and sold them for the next 12 years . Though the efficiency of these lamps was lower than that of the osmium , tantalum , and Nernst lamps , they were much easier to produce in quantity , easier to handle , and more durable than the others . Low cost was also an important factor . When introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents , and this price was lowered as sales volume grew . Beginning about 1905 the manufacturers changed lamp ratings from candlepower to wattage . A 50-watt carbon lamp was just about equivalent to the former 16-cp lamp . Because of its higher efficiency , a 20-cp Gem lamp also drew 5o watts and was so rated when the wattage basis was adopted .  | THE TUNGSTEN LAMP As the quest for new filament materials continued , the metal tungsten became a leading candidate . This was natural because of tungsten 's very high melting point , about 3370 ? C , and because of its ready availability at rather low cost in the form of wolframite ore and other ores . Tungsten was known as one of the heaviest and hardest chemical elements . But these qualities still fell far short of guaranteeing that it would make good filaments for lamps . Earlier experimenters found it intractable , either as a hard , brittle mass or an equally perverse fine crystalline powder that resisted being worked into a coherent form . Turner D. Bottome had tried to develop a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a practical solution to the problem . The Westinghouse company had retained Lodyguine , the Russian researcher , to attempt the development of a composite filament employing tungsten along with other materials , but his two years of work ( 1893 ? 1894 ) had also been unsuccessful . In Europe during the years 1902 ? 1906 several leading research men were working diligently on tungsten filaments as well as other metals . The same was true to a lesser degree in the United States . As it finally developed , the men whose tungsten lamp won primary recognition were Alexander Just and Franz Hanaman . They were laboratory assistants in chemistry in a technical high school in Vienna . Working from 1902 to 1904 , they persisted until at last they had perfected a series of chemical processes resulting in a practical tungsten filament . Essentially this was a matter of combining tungsten with other materials in order to get a cohesive filament structure and then treating the mixture chemically and with heat . These processes removed the other materials , so that only tungsten of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of efficiency the new product was sensational . The initial light output of these tungsten lamps was 7.85 lumens per watt , a tremendous advance over earlier lamps . In addition , the useful  | lamp life was excellent ? about Boo hours . The filaments were fragile , they were lengthy , and the lamps had to be very carefully handled . But the two laboratory workers , low-salaried and hard pressed for working facilities , had achieved one of the most notable triumphs in the history of lampmaking . Just and Hanaman had to borrow the equivalent of $6o to pay for their applications for British and French patents in 1904 , having exhausted their slim financial resources . Because they had no money , they were beaten to the punch by other European inventors in applying for United States patents . One of these others was Dr. Werner von Bolton of the German company , Siemens and Halske . As the principal inventor of the tantalum lamp , von Bolton had worked out a theory for making filaments from other metals . These , he claimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of wire ) just as tantalum was ductile by nature . His patent application claimed tungsten as one of these metals , but gave no description of any processing that would result in ductile tungsten . Another claimant was Dr. Hans Kuzel of Vienna . He devised a system for making metal filaments , one of which was tungsten . The process was somewhat different from the method used by Just and Hanaman but resulted in filaments that closely resembled theirs . Von Bolton made his American patent application on Nov . Io , 1904 . Kuzel followed on Jan. 4 , 1905 , while Just and Hanaman filed on July 6 , 1905 . In the meantime the Austrian Welsbach company had experimented further with the osmium lamp , using various other metals in combination with osmium . The Welsbach researchers found that the best combination consisted of osmium and tungsten . The resultant " osram " lamps were gradually changed , using less osmium and more tungsten , until finally they were entirely tungsten-filament lamps . The situation regarding American patent rights was confused , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be recognized as the originator of the tungsten lamp . General Electric purchased an option on the Welsbach Amer-  | ican rights for $100,000 in 1906 and began the manufacture of tungsten lamps the following year . The National company bought an interest in the rights from G.E . and also started making and selling the lamps . Engineers of both companies had to do considerable development work before the lamps could be manufactured in quantity . Even so , the American public was able to buy tungsten bulbs , more than twice as efficient as carbon , within a year after their introduction on the European market . For full protection , the General Electric Company bought the American patent applications of Just and Hanaman in 1909 for $250,000 ; in the same year the company purchased Kuzel 's application at a cost of $240,000 . After long deliberations in the Patent Office , the Just and Hanaman invention was approved and the patent granted , on Feb. 27 , 1912 . The Kuzel and von Bolton applications were turned down . Since von Bolton had not indicated a method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Patent Office , but the conflict between the other two applications boiled down essentially to a question of priority . Just and Hanaman had made their application for French and British patents with the borrowed money on Nov. 4 , 1904 ; Kuzel had made application for an American patent on Jan. 4 , 1905 , just 6o days later . The difference between these dates was the main factor in establishing priority for Just and Hanaman . Their process was successful primarily on filaments for 40 watts and larger . For smaller-size tungsten lamps , Dr. Aladar Pacz of the National group developed a chemical process for making filaments of smaller size . General Electric and National placed a price of $1. so on the 4o-watt tungsten lamp when it was introduced in 1907 . The 6o-watt lamp was priced at $1.75 . Production costs were high and sales volume was low at first . During the next few years , however , prices dropped rapidly as production and sales increased . The higher efficiency of tungsten lamps led to much better lighting , rather than to reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , utility-company income from lighting increased . Where the central-station companies had formerly replaced carbon lamps without charge ( the " free renewal " system ) , most of them now charged customers for tungsten lamps . This had  | the effect of changing much of the distribution of lamps from the light and power companies to other channels , with this business going more and more to electrical wholesalers and dealers . DUCTILE TUNGSTEN Tungsten was still a stubborn metal . Just and Hanaman and the others , including General Electric research workers and engineers , had managed to fashion it into filament wires and so to make rather good lamps . Yet it was something like getting a fractious child to obey , halfheartedly and only part of the time , through the use of makeshift methods of discipline . The metal was likely to break at any time , unable to survive rough handling , and was costly to fabricate . In its filament form it still presented many problems . Even before the new lamps went on the market , the General Electric Research Laboratory had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1905 , Dr. William D. Coolidge began work with the laboratory . This was a significant date because Coolidge , during the next 40 years , was to contribute some of the most fruitful research work the electrical industry ever saw . For 13 of those years ( 1932 ? 1945 ) he was the laboratory 's director , succeeding Dr. Whitney . He was assistant director from 1908 to 1928 and associate director for the next four years . A graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in electrical engineering , class of 1896 , Coolidge took his doctorate in physics at the University of Leipzig , where Whitney had also earned his Ph.D . Again like Whitney , he joined the General Electric research staff after several years of teaching at M.I.T. In 1906 Dr. Coolidge started work on the study and improvement of tungsten filaments . His first achievement in this field came with comparative ease in contrast to the adversities he was to encounter in later experiments . He created an amalgam filament , using mercury , cadmium , and bismuth as a binder for powdered tungsten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps . In both cases the entire mixture ( of pasty consistency ) was squirted through a die . Then  | the binder was removed by applying high heat and by passing a heavy current through the filament . This left a filament of rather pure tungsten . The treatment process , similar to that used for making osmium filaments , had the effect of sintering the tungsten ? that is , partially fusing the tiny particles so that they would cling together better . Coolidge 's amalgam , originated in 1906 , produced stronger and better filaments . It also made possible the manufacture of larger tungsten filaments for higher-wattage lamps . Then he tackled the problem that had baffled so many experimenters in both Europe and the United States ? metallurgists , physicists , chemists . How could tungsten be made ductile , so that it could be worked and drawn into a very fine , very tough wire , free of its maddening brittleness ? Like all such research projects in the laboratory , this was a group effort , in that Dr. Coolidge had helpers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions were his , step by step . Before developing the amalgam filament Coolidge had proved that the brittleness of tungsten did not derive from the presence of impurities but was a characteristic of the metal itself . He did this by making samples of tungsten as pure as he could make them and then deliberately adding impurities ( other elements ) and studying their effects . This saved the time and effort of trying to obtain superpure tungsten as a means of getting ductility . ( It had been von Bolton 's theory , based on his experience with tantalum , that a metal such as tungsten could be made ductile if the impurities were removed . ) For about two years of constant experiment , 1906-1908 , Dr. Coolidge tried a variety of ways to treat tungsten . He hammered it gently at various temperatures . These experiments showed some promise . The tungsten filaments treated in this way were elongated somewhat . But when allowed to cool they were still brittle . He squeezed the filaments between the rolls of a small rolling mill such as jewelers used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again the filaments lengthened under treatment . And again , discouragingly , they remained brittle when cool .  | Next , Coolidge pressed tungsten between hot blocks of hardened alloy steel . From this he learned more about the reaction of the metal to hot working . The results gave a little more encouragement . Up to this point he had proved that tungsten filaments could be hammered , rolled , and pressed , with some gains in mechanical strength . Still the fact remained that this was not truly ductile tungsten . Finally , Coolidge and his assistants drew a heated tungsten filament through tiny dies . The dies were also heated , and so were the pliers used to pull the filament through the dies . This was a difficult process . It demanded painstaking effort and the utmost patience . Each die was smaller in diameter , by the merest trifle , than the last preceding die . For each draw , of course , the die opening was also a trifle smaller than the diameter of the filament to be drawn through it ? a fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather high heat , Coolidge managed to complete the series of draws . And amazingly enough , the resultant tungsten wire had lost much of its brittleness . It had become both strong and pliable , even when cold ! After more than two years of unremitting work , Dr. Coolidge had succeeded in producing ductile tungsten . The structure of the metal had been changed largely from crystalline to fibrous ? and from brittle to tough . The structural change that made other metals fragile had made tungsten stronger . This accomplishment , attained in the fall of 1908 , was nevertheless only a good start . Laborious methods had produced a small amount of ductile tungsten in the laboratory , but that hardly solved the problem of turning out the material in quantity . It was not factory production , and any factory manager in the business would have scoffed at it as a lampmaking procedure . Many an invention dies at this same point ? where the effort or expense of duplicating it makes mass production impractical . The sample of ductile tungsten that Coolidge had developed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in diameter . Obviously , if commercial quantities of workable tungsten wire were to be manufactured , a much larger " ingot " or slug would have to be formed as the starting unit . Then it might be  | possible to draw a lengthy wire of the correct size for lamp filaments . So Dr. Coolidge began trying to press tungsten powder into such a slug ? 1/ to % inch square in cross section and about 6 inches long . He tried molds of several different designs , and utilized several types of pressure , attempting to get a small but consistent body of tungsten . After getting a fairly cohesive tungsten slug , he tried to harden it by means of various heat treatments . Time after time the result was disappointing ; the slugs cracked to pieces whenever he tried to work them . A dozen ingenious methods resulted in repeated failures . Dr. Coolidge would not give up . He next tried swaging machines . These machines had two small hammers ( or die halves ) that operated at high speed . Several hundred times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was fed through the machine . The hammers and the opening through which the rod passed constituted a swaging die . Again , failure after failure occurred when existing swaging machines were used . ( Such machines were used for working steel ? for example , to hammer steel needles to a point . ) So Dr. Coolidge , analyzing the reasons for failure , built special swaging dies and modified the machines . By using many successive dies , still keeping the tungsten hot during the swaging process , he was eventually able to reduce its diameter to 3o mils ( 3%,00 inch ) . Of course the metal stock was elongated greatly during these operations . He now had ductile tungsten in a form small enough to be called a wire . It was too coarse for filaments , but now it could be drawn . The final steps consisted of a great many draws of the heated wire through heated diamond dies . This processing reduced the wire to the sizes needed for filaments to suit various voltages and wattages . Even after this successful creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to solve other problems before the manufacturing operation could be transferred to the lamp factory . He overcame the annoying lack of uniformity  | in the tungsten ingots , which had caused failures with many of them . Also , the very high heat of lamp operation tended to make the filament crystalline again . Tungsten crystals in the wire were often offset from each other in such a way that weaknesses developed and early failure of lamps occurred . So Coolidge had to find ways to reduce offsetting . The most effective method he found was to add a very small amount of thorium dioxide to the tungsten powder used in the formation of ingots . At long last the laboratory work was essentially finished . In March , 1910 , General Electric announced Dr. Coolidge 's success in making ductile tungsten . The further work in the laboratory through the remainder of 1910 and the early months of 1911 was concerned with perfecting processes rather than originating them . The preceding account of Coolidge 's work may seem lengthy but it really covers only the high spots ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of concentrated effort . In succeeding years this work was to revolutionize lamp manufacture in many respects . The list of advantages for lamps made with ductile tungsten filaments was long and impressive . First , filament strength increased tremendously : samples of drawn tungsten wire 1/l,000 inch in diameter showed a tensile strength of more than 600,000 pounds per square inch . Lamps containing these filaments could take the shock and vibration of regular use in automobiles , railroad cars , and street railway cars . They could be burned in any position . ( This was a real convenience . Earlier tungsten lamps usually had to be burned base-up . ) The filaments could be sized accurately for designed voltages and efficiencies . The wire could be coiled , in order to obtain concentrated sources of light for such focusing lamps as automobile headlights . Production costs were low compared to earlier tungsten filaments . Manufacturing was easier and more accurate , as methods were worked out to accomplish it , and the result was a much more uniform product . The efficiency of the lamps climbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of useful life . The long struggle in the laboratory was  | therefore proved worth while . So was the money expended in the laboratory on the project ? more than $115,000 . Ductile-tungsten lamps came on the market in 1911-another product of General Electric research . The company scrapped a half-million dollars ' worth of equipment for making squirted filaments , along with a half-million dollars ' worth of squirted-filament lamps . In July , 1912 , Dr. Coolidge applied for a final patent on the process for making ductile tungsten ( having applied earlier for various parts of the procedure ) . The patent was granted Dec. 30 , 1913 . The following prices applied to General Electric lamps made with the new filaments : Table In terms of cost and effort in development and production , the change to ductile-tungsten lamps from carbon lamps was like the change the Ford Motor Company made from the Model T to the Model A. High first costs were necessary in order to give the public far better lighting . As costs declined over the years , price reductions followed regularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best lighting that research and manufacturing skill could produce . // Edison had used platinum lead-in wires for his lamps , and this precious metal continued in use for many years . It suited the purpose because , as a conductor of electricity , it could be readily joined to glass with a tight seal and had almost exactly the same coefficient of thermal expansion as glass . In other words , when heated it expanded at the same rate and to the same degree as glass ; when cooled , it contracted just as glass did . Consequently , the use of platinum reduced the possibilities of cracks and air leaks that would cause lamp failure .  | From 1900 to 1910 lamp manufacturers made attempts to replace some or all of the platinum in lead-in wires . It was expensive , as anyone knows who has purchased a platinum ring . But no other material existing in nature possessed the same attributes for lead-in wires . Most lamps made in the United States continued to use platinum , at least for the portion of the wires passing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting engineer , developed in 1911 the first substitute wire that was widely used . Eldred combined several materials ? a core of nickel-iron , coatings of copper and silver , and an exterior covering of platinum . He applied for a patent on this wire in 1911 and sold rights to General Electric . The patent was granted in 1913 . The company 's use of Eldred 's invention continued for only about two years , however , because of a new development in the G-E Research Laboratory . In 1912 Dr. Colin G. Fink of the laboratory staff developed dumet wire . Dr. Fink had ably assisted Coolidge in the metalworking research that produced ductile tungsten . Now he invented a superior lead-in wire . He dipped a nickel-iron wire core into copper sulphate to give it a thin copper coating . Then he inserted it in a brass sheath and a final outer sheath of copper . The layer of brass permitted brazing of the outer copper sheath to the nickel-iron core . The brazing was done in a furnace , where the brass melted and formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dumet " ( two metals ) because both copper and nickel-iron were used . The American patent Dr. Fink applied for in 1912 was finally granted in 1924 . W. L. Van Keuren of General Electric added an improvement by coating the dumet wire with borax . When the wire was dipped into a borax solution , the resultant formation of copper borate made the wire more adherent to glass . Dumet wire makes a very satisfactory tight seal for lamps ? at least as effective as platinum and of course far less expensive . It has been used since 1913 . In 1909 and during the next few years there was also considerable activity in improving the " getters " used in manufacturing lamps . A getter is an active chemical agent used inside the bulb ,  | either to obtain a better vacuum or to help prevent bulb blackening . The Malignani process ( discussed in Chapter 5 ) employed phosphorus to improve the vacuum . In that process , however , the phosphorus was not called a " getter . " In 1909 John T. Marshall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dipping the filament and mount into phosphorus mixed with water . The lamps were exhausted and sealed off . Then , when the filament was burned for a short time at high incandescence , the phosphorus coating vaporized . The gases present in the bulb combined with the phosphorus and apparently settled on the interior glass wall of the bulb by a process of adsorption . In any event , the result was a good vacuum . Other getters , used later , had a similar effect . Franz Skaupy , an Austrian chemist , pioneered the use of getters for another purpose : to reduce bulb blackening . The discoloration came from evaporated filament material deposited on the glass during the life of the lamp . Skaupy used chemical compounds of the halogen group , placed inside the lamp in the glass rod supporting the filament . The heat of normal operation caused the halogen compounds to break up chemically . They combined with the tungsten evaporating from the filament . This produced a deposit on the glass bulb that was lighter in color than the blackening in earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five years after his original discovery . Since the Skaupy getters were useful mainly in lamps of 100 watts or larger , General Electric carried on further research . Dr. Fink developed a getter for use with smaller bulbs : potassium iodide . Harry H. Needham of General Electric also experimented successfully in this field , the principal element in his getter being cryolite . The developments introduced by Fink and Needham were first utilized in 1912 . In later years a number of other improvements were made in the use of getters . Notable among these was the work of three men : Ernst Friederich , a German experimenter , and Frederic W. Gill and Harold Blake of General Electric .  | MAZDA LAMPS AND MAZDA SERVICE As the tungsten lamp began to replace the carbon lamp , the leaders of General Electric and National looked for ways to dramatize the research developments that were making their lamps better from year to year . The research laboratory staff , growing rapidly , was making new discoveries . The engineers , such as John W. Howell and W. R. Burrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cleveland , were adding their contributions . Improved manufacturing methods matched the advances in lamp design . This research progress in all phases of lampmaking was giving customers more lighting value than ever before . The lamps incorporated the latest and best ideas in design and processing . A symbol was needed to designate these facts to the public . In I909 General Electric and National jointly adopted the trade-mark MAZDA for certain of their lamps . This was not the name of a product but the mark of a service . The brand names previously used were continued . For example , bulbs manufactured at Harrison had been sold as Edison lamps . Now they were called Edison MAZDA lamps.The word MAZDA symbolized the research , the testing , and the manufacturing techniques that combined to make the lamps superior . In Persian mythology , the god of light was known as Ahura Mazda . To the Persians , light was synonymous with knowledge and goodness , and so was the name Mazda . Much deliberation and debate preceded the choice of this peculiarly fitting name . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held among the men to select a suitable name . I lowever , in the discussions that followed there was some opposition to the prize-winning name and it was not adopted . Some time later , at a meeting of top executives and others interested in the lamp business , the subject came up again . Among the men in the group were F. S. Terry , A. G. Davis , and Frederick P. Fish . Around the conference table they concentrated on finding  | the elusive word or phrase that would serve their purpose . Suddenly Fish broke the silence . " MAZDA , " he said . " That 's the name ! Let 's call them MAZDA lamps , after the ancient god of light . " More discussion followed , but finally the group agreed . Fish was a leading patent lawyer of the time , retained as a counsel by General Electric . He made many important contributions to the business by his work in the complex field of patent law , but it is doubtful if any of them meant more in the years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Electric and National began to use the mark on lamps using ductile-tungsten filaments . But the application of the name was only a small part of the MAZDA development . The most significant element was the research and test procedure standing behind the name . It came to be known as MAZDA service , and for many years it provided an assurance of the highest lamp quality . The way to check on lamp quality is to test the lamps ? constantly and rigorously . Tests of lamp life , of lamp strength , of all essential characteristics ? these tell the factory manager and the laboratory researcher how good the lamps are and point toward possible ways to make them better . The testing procedures that had been carried on in the various lamp plants and laboratories were now enlarged and intensified . For several years the General Electric Research Laboratory carried on most of the MAZDA service testing . Later ( starting in 1920 ) the testing was handled by the Electrical Testing Laboratories , an independent organization in New York City . Laurence A. Hawkins , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laboratory staff were the key men in establishing and maintaining the MAZDA service system of lamp testing and quality inspection . Hawkins had joined the laboratory in 1903 . Fisher , after some years with Westinghouse , joined General Electric about the time MAZDA service was started . Under their supervision , the system steadily grew into a dynamic means of progress in making better and better lamps . One of their toughest problems in the early years was winning  | the cooperation of factory managers in setting up an independent inspection service , not only at Schenectady but in every General Electric and National lamp plant . A manager naturally felt that he knew best how to maintain quality , how to spot errors in manufacture that might result in defective lamps ? in other words , how to run his business . He was not happy about the proposal to place an inspection team in his factory to take random samples of his finished production and subject them to inspections and tests in addition to those he would normally make . Gradually , however , Fisher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . There were not only advantages to the public in maintenance of high quality , and benefits to the companies , but there were also very definite advantages to the factory managers and employees . The product of every lamp plant was in competition with the other factories in the MAZDA service system . Samples of the finished products were thoroughly tested in a completely impartial manner , and the results were reported regularly to the managers . They could see exactly where they stood on the quality scale . They could be sure that the testing in all the plants had been strictly comparable . In addition , they found in this system better opportunities to remedy any processing that might be causing faulty production . The idea was not to run a manager 's business nor to tell him what to do , but to give him facts about his product upon which he could base his planning and action for further improvement . Before long the inspection service was wholeheartedly accepted by the managers . MAZDA service also brought to each factory the latest approved design ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in the research laboratory , in one of the development laboratories , or in a factory . Once an idea had been thoroughly investigated and accepted , a standardized procedure was set up to carry it to every plant and place it in universal operation . The farsighted investment in research exemplified in the Gen-  | eral Electric Research Laboratory was now bearing fruit . Essentially the carbon-lamp era was over , though the change to tungsten lamps was gradual and carbon lamps were still manufactured . Hardly a week passed without some small but significant improvement in lamp design or manufacture . Modern science had largely replaced cut-and-try methods in the industry .  | Great Changes in the Industry Picture THE DUCTILE-TUNGSTEN LAMP opened tremendous new opportunities for growth in the lighting industry . And the lamp business did grow at a rapidly accelerating pace . In 1909 the production of large lamps totaled 66.7 million ; this was the output of all U.S. manufacturers . ( Large lamps include the standard line of bulbs most commonly used , and form a classification distinct from miniature lamps such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years earlier the figure for large lamps had been 25.3 million . By 1914 production had reached 88.5 million , a gain of more than 32 per cent in five years . In 1909 only 20 per cent of large lamps had tungsten filaments ; the great majority were still carbon lamps . By 1914 about 85 per cent were tungsten lamps . General Electric 's Edison Lamp Works continued to progress under the leadership of George F. Morrison , with Howell and Burrows the chief technicians and Almon D. Page as sales manager . Morrison had joined the organization in 1882 and had been general foreman and superintendent before attaining the position of works manager . Page , known to everyone in the industry as " Adam " rather than Almon , had entered the Edison Works as assistant factory manager and sales manager in 189o . After 1892 he concentrated his talents on sales . The General Electric operation had already matured consider ; ably by the turn of the century . It was in the National Electric Lamp Association that the most noticeable changes occurred in lamp-industry organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many associated lamp factories throughout the country , there was effervescent activity everywhere . Terry acted as vicepresident and general manager of the parent company , with B. G. Tremaine the second vice-president and sales manager . They were building a solid , efficient business structure . The other officers played prominent parts in this effort : J. B. Crouse , president ; H. A. Tremaine , treasurer ; and J. Robert Crouse , secretary . Their task was made much easier by the capable men they had brought into the National group . TYPICAL NATIONAL MEN It would be futile here to attempt a summary of all the notable individual achievements by those who pioneered the development of the National company . However , a few leaders so typified the company 's spirit and the abilities of its men that they can be singled out as examples . For instance , there were John E. Randall and T. W. Frech , Jr. , who worked together on so many projects that they came to be considered as a team . These two men combined expert laboratory knowledge with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall had the same type of ingenuity in lampmaking as his opposite number at Harrison , John Howell . He started with Thomson-Houston at Lynn in 1886 as an electrician . By 1895 he had transferred to the Columbia company in St. Louis and advanced to the position of factory superintendent . In 1903 he became filament and lamp engineer of the National group . With Frech , he planned , organized , and operated National 's first tungsten-lamp factory . Randall 's facility in all phases of lamp development and production was accompanied by a genial , easy-to-workwith nature that inspired his associates . Theodore W. Frech began his lamp-manufacturing career as an assistant to F. S. Terry in 1901 . During the next three years , Terry sent him to work in several lamp factories : Fostoria , Bryan-Marsh in Marlboro , Mass. , the Columbia plant in St. Louis , and others . Young Frech handled these special assignments  | exceptionally well . So in 1904 Terry brought him into the Cleveland headquarters . For the next nine years he held several responsible positions , including the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frech was a remarkable " idea man , " never at a loss for new projects on which he lavished intense interest and enthusiasm . He worked on the development of the tantalum lamp , the pressed tungsten filament , and the drawn-wire tungsten filament . It was the activities of Frech and Randall that grew into the Lamp Development Laboratory of National . Randall managed the laboratory from its formal inception in 1909 until 1914 , when he became the company 's consulting engineer . The Engineering Department , of course , formed the nucleus around which the National factories were combined into a strong federation . Terry and Tremaine found in Samuel E. Doane the man to manage this work and assemble a competent staff . They brought him to Cleveland in 1900 from the Bryan-Marsh company in Marlboro , where he had been superintendent for three years , but his lampmaking experience started some years before that . Beginning in 1886 , Doane was an engineer and assistant foreman of the Thomson-Houston incandescent-lamp factory . He moved to the Edison Works in 1892 when General Electric concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer and later as superintendent , he earned the reputation that led to his Bryan-Marsh appointment and the position as chief engineer of National . As he built his department at Cleveland , several key assistants helped to establish National 's engineering prestige . Notable among these men were Ward Harrison and W. M. Skiff ? Harrison as a brilliant engineer and Skiff as the staff director who relieved Doane of many management responsibilities . Doane inaugurated a constructive program of activities that profoundly affected the progress of the whole lighting industry . Among these were the development of basic knowledge of lighting requirements in many specific fields ; the design of lighting sys-  | tems ; and the publication of the pioneer bulletins on lamps and lighting . Doane was a leader in planning the use of light on a sound economic basis , in the standardization of bases and sockets , and in the simplification of product lines to improve quality and lower the costs to the consumer . As National grew , there was no lack of factory managers capable of competing with the best talent anywhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose diversified background with many lamp companies from 1891 to 1906 prepared him for assuming the managership of manufacturing for National in 1909 . He led that department for 16 years . There was Philip J. Pritchard , Roberts 's first lieutenant , who was to cap a distinguished career with his direction of the pilot-plant work on fluorescent lamps many years later . A dozen more could be named from the National team . Characteristically they had climbed through the ranks in several companies . Now they cooperated in the National group while at the same time vigorously trying to outdo each other in improving filaments , machinery , glass , and lamp-assembly operations . Good machine designers were most essential to progress in making better lamps . Here , too , National was well represented . John T. Fagan and his associates in the machine shops matched the work of the experts in the Edison Lamp Works in developing lampmaking machinery . In fact , the researcher today finds it impossible to establish clear-cut priorities in this field . Did a certain improvement in the sealing-in machine or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer is that the machine designers in both organizations hit upon the better method at practically the same time . They " borrowed " each other 's ideas whenever they could . If one factory got a step ahead , it was n't long before the mechanics in another plant had " improved the improvement . " National 's excellent developments in the manufacture of lamp glass were centered in the Fostoria Glass Works , led by Edward O. Cross . On the scientific side , National established the Nela Research Laboratory in 1908 , with Dr. Edward B. Hyde , an able physicist ,  | as director , aided by Dr. Herbert E. Ives and Dr. Percy W. Cobb . Within the next six years the laboratory staff grew to include seven physicists , a physiologist , a psychologist , and a considerable number of assistants . They studied the production of light and the effects of light on human welfare . It was no longer merely a matter of making and selling bulbs ; the industry was beginning to study the basic scientific aspects of lighting applications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew into a unique institution as the years passed . In 1904 Terry and Tremaine decided that an annual summer get-together should be held at some attractive location away from Cleveland , so that business and pleasure could be combined . In that year the meeting took place in Muskoka , Ontario ; in 1905 at Montmorency Falls , Quebec ; and in 1906 at Chautauqua , N.Y . These were all delightful resort locations . However , the National leaders were not satisfied until they had found a permanent gathering place . They found what they wanted in 1907 ? a sizable island in Lake Ontario about 2 miles offshore from Henderson Harbor , N.Y . Terry , Tremaine , and a few associates purchased the island , christened it Association Island , and arranged for the building of necessary facilities . The first Association Island meeting or " camp " was held in the summer of 1907 . During succeeding years the Island 's buildings and equipment were greatly expanded . They included an administration building with a general store and post office , quarters for permanent caretaking personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large tents with wooden floors served as sleeping quarters for all those attending Island camps . The sports facilities included fishing , boating , swimming , golf , tennis , baseball , bowling , trapshooting ? in fact , almost any game or sport desired . There was a very definite purpose behind the plans for the Island 's use . Terry and Tremaine had stated their policy of operation in these words : " National is not to be an organization of people working for other people ; it is to be an organization of  | people working together , at many different tasks , for the ideals and public service of the organization as a whole . " The Island provided a concrete means of demonstrating this policy and making it work . The men attending the Island camps were , in many cases , former business rivals . Even after joining National , they competed with each other for business . Each wanted to make his particular brand of lamps better ( Sunbeam , Bryan-Marsh , etc. ) and wanted to sell more of them . Disagreements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of petty jealousies over promotions and of friction between men working in the same department . Tremaine and Terry believed that when men not only worked together , but relaxed together at an Island camp , they would build mutual respect and liking that could come about in no other way . The meetings on the Island covered common problems and allowed for serious business planning . Each meeting set up an organization with a camp manager and a staff of assistants , athletic directors , and committees to handle a dozen different activities . A " show " committee planned and presented a comedy burlesquing the rigors of the lamp business they had encountered during the year . During this entertainment the " bosses " received a good-natured roasting ? as thorough as the drubbing administered to national political figures at the annual Gridiron dinners in Washington . In 1909 the men at camp organized the Society of Nela , with an elaborate constitution and bylaws . There were three classes of members : the Graybeards , who were the original members ; firstyear men making their first trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had n't yet graduated to the august and privileged rank of Graybeard . Working as they did in many different parts of the country , the men got to know each other more thoroughly at these Island meetings than they could have done at formal business meetings . The ability of a newcomer to the Island to " take it " when initiated into the Society of Nela indicated as much about his character as his daily actions in business ? perhaps more . Then , besides group  | activities , there were countless opportunities for two men to talk calmly together about mutual problems or disagreements . Association Island was fully shared by the Edison Lamp Works people , too , starting in 1909 . They held regular meetings on the Island and helped to expand its facilities just as the National group did . The days at the Island comprise some of the happiest memories of many men still in the lamp business . They say : " We got rid of more gripes , inhibitions , and misunderstandings on the Island than we ever did any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people associated with National or the Edison Lamp Works knew of General Electric 's financial interest in the National company . Terry , Tremaine , and the other National officers exercised complete control over their operations , with no interference by the G-E officials . Cross-licensing agreements gave each company the use of the other 's findings in research and development . But they competed keenly in the application of those findings and they contested with each other for lamp business in the expanding market . During the administration of Theodore Roosevelt the Department of Justice embarked on a vigorous antitrust program . This continued after the election of William Howard Taft in 1908 , and suits were filed in a wide variety of industries . One of these was directed at the incandescent-lamp business . On March 3 , 1911 , the Justice Department brought suit in the U.S. Circuit Court of Northern Ohio against General Electric and 34 other companies . These included National and its subsidiaries , Westinghouse , the Corning Glass Works , and several other glass and machine manufacturers . In June of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , however , the company , on advice of its counsel , decided to accept a decree . The presiding judge , John M. Killitts , handed down a decree on Oct. 12 , 1911 . It applied to the other companies as well as to G.E .  | The Court directed General Electric to operate the National company and its subsidiaries as an integral part of the G-E business . This was by far the most important provision . By this time National 's percentage of the total lamp business in the United States closely approached that of the Edison Lamp Works ; both ran far ahead of their nearest competitor . The decree ruled out any direct price agreements between the lamp manufacturers . However , a patent owner could specify prices and terms of sale on patented lamps made by a licensee . This applied to the sales of manufacturing licensees ; fixing of resale prices was disapproved . Finally , the decree prohibited certain limitations from being included in agreements made by the lamp companies with suppliers of glass , machinery , and other materials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining 25 per cent of the National common stock . The National company became the National Quality Lamp Works of General Electric ( later shortened to National Lamp Works of G.E. ) . Terry and Tremaine remained as managers , assured by General Electric 's top officers that they would have a free hand in operating their part of the lamp business . The whole industry had to review its operations and devise new plans in 1912 . There was a great opportunity to bring increasing lighting benefits to the American public ? to lead the way with light . This was the prime objective of the new plans worked out by the industry 's leaders .  | Nela Park ? the University of Light oME TIME before the 1911 antitrust suit , F. S. Terry took action to end the frustrations caused by National 's cramped Sand crowded quarters in Cleveland . Terry dreamed of a future location entirely different from the typical industrial environment . Quietly he began to investigate outlying areas , far from the busy midtown sections . He could imagine a spacious headquarters site , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no air pollution or distracting noise . They could have attractive buildings , he reasoned , something better than the monotonous , ugly construction that had always been used for factories and for most office buildings . Each building could be planned for the special needs of the department it would house . Since that time hundreds of industrial organizations have recognized these and similar advantages . The trend today is toward outlying locations . But in 1910 such an idea was decidedly a novelty . When Terry first described his plan to his associates , they treated it with cool reserve . He was so persistent , though , that he finally persuaded them to go on an inspection tour of several possible sites . They drove through the outskirts of Cleveland and finally stopped at the location Terry preferred . As the manager expounded the benefits of his scheme , his companions grew more and more incredulous . " But this is ' way out in the country , " they said . " It might be all  | right for a farm or a residential area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any of the facilities needed for a business . " Terry marshaled his selling points : 1 . Lower land costs and construction costs than a tall downtown building or series of buildings would require . 2 . Lower taxes and operating costs . 3 . Better atmosphere for effective work ? much more pleasant working conditions . 4 . Every building designed for its specific uses . S. The fact that employees could also live in the neighborhood , in less expensive , more enjoyable homes than they would otherwise have , and within easy travel distance to and from their work . 6 . Public attention and interest , stemming from the novelty of the idea , yet not conflicting with the solid advantages that National would realize . " We 'll have ample room to expand , " he said . " The business is going to grow beyond anything we 've seen yet . Why place ourselves where we 'll be overcrowded again in another ten years ? Why ca n't a business place be beautiful as well as useful ? We 'll all feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier all around . " The others remained skeptical and for several weeks nothing further was decided on the subject . Finally , however , Terry won acceptance from Tremaine and the others , and their own imaginations began to catch fire . In September , 1910 , they agreed on the selection of the site and started working out detailed plans . The land needed initially ? 33 acres ? was purchased in January , 1912 . They chose the name Nela Park for the future home of the National Lamp Works , with Nela being derived from the initials of the National Electric Lamp Association . It was truly handsome acreage , rising southward above the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Noble Road in East Cleveland . Most of the land was at the top of the hill , where it flattened out at an elevation 230 feet above the level of Lake Erie . Toward the east it sloped away again into a series of wooded ravines that added immeasurably to the natural beauty of the scene .  | BUILDING A NEW HOME The National management wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The buildings , they felt , should harmonize with the surroundings . As the chief architect for the project they chose Frank E. Wallis of New York City . Frank Goodwillie , an architectural engineer , served as his top assistant . The National officials brought the architects to Cleveland to " live with them " for several months . By drawing their plans at the East 45th Street plant , they were better able to assess the needs of each department . A modified Georgian style was selected for the buildings , and Wallis spent some time in England for further study of the eighteenth-century architecture he was to adapt for Nela Park . The structural supports of the buildings consisted of steel and reinforced concrete , resting on stone foundations . The exteriors were of brick , together with contrasting terra cotta . These materials were chosen with great care , and the brickwork and stonework planned to the last detail for pleasing appearance as well as utility . The simple lines sketched by the architects avoided any effect of massiveness or overdecoration . Planning went ahead during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the future . The cornerstone for the Engineering building was laid on March 25 , 1912 , about five months after the G.E. ? National combination resulting from the suit . This building stood on the north side of the broad main quadrangle . Construction of the Nela Research Laboratory began in April . In late July the workmen started erecting the Sales building ( later known as Sales Promotion and now the Advertising building ) on the east side of the quadrangle . Meantime work had been progressing on the Nela Operating building , to serve as the maintenance headquarters for the entire plant . Located near the Noble Road entrance , this was the first structure to be completed . At the south side of the main square , the largest of the original group of buildings began to take shape . This was the Lamp Development  | Laboratory , where the experimental work on products , the testing of lamps , and similar activities would be carried on . Beyond the Sales building and a short distance away from the quadrangle was the Administration building , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central plaza , at the west end , was not erected until the others were occupied . It later became the best-known building of all because it was to house the famous G-E Lighting Institute , visited annually by thousands of people eager to see and study the latest developments in lamps and lighting . On the quadrangle side of the Institute the builders constructed a million-gallon water pool 120 feet in diameter . This was originally intended as a storage tank for Nela Park 's water supply , but the architects left it open at the top and made it a decorative element rather than an eyesore . Later the water supply was otherwise provided and the pool remained as a pleasant feature of the landscape , beautifully lighted at night . Also notable in later construction was an entrance lodge at the foot of the hill , approached by a street cut through from Euclid Avenue and called Nela Avenue . From this a winding drive climbed the hill to the Engineering building and continued beyond to join the other driveways through Nela Park ? a total of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from a central power plant , with wires and pipes placed underground in an ingenious arrangement of tunnels . The tunnels ran mostly under the sidewalks between buildings and the heat loss from the pipes helped to keep the walks clear of snow in the winter . Moving day for the National Lamp Works came on April 18 , 1913 . It was a big day in many ways . First , there was the diversity of people involved in the move : factory workers handling many different jobs , engineers , clerks , metallurgists , executives , salesmen , stenographers , physicists , maintenance men , chemists ? now they all had the opportunity to settle down in spacious buildings designed for comfort and efficiency . The physical task of moving this business headquarters has of course been surpassed since 1913 but it had very seldom been equaled before that time . Finally the  | 200 moving vans made their last trip to Nela Park , completing the transfer of some i8,000 boxes and crates plus an enormous tonnage of other equipment . LIVING IN THE NEW HOME It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved into the greatly expanded headquarters it is today . The total area is now 85 acres . Other buildings added from time to time brought the total to more than 20 . Gradually the landscaping was perfected , so that the site came to resemble a well-manicured university campus . Employee health and comfort received painstaking attention from the start . Additions to this program comprised an impressive list : a cafeteria and dining room serving good meals at cost ; rest and recreation rooms for women ; a well-stocked general library for employees ; a dispensary providing medical , dental , and nursing care ; a barber shop ; a transportation office ; a large garage and parking area ; and a branch bank of the Cleveland Trust Co . The recreational facilities established over the years would make a chapter in themselves . They included tennis courts , baseball diamonds , an outdoor swimming pool , and bowling alleys . Some distance removed from the main buildings , several acres were transformed into Nela Camp , with many features comparable to those on Association Island . An auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a variety of sports fields made ample summer recreation available to employees . Beyond that , they provided for business meetings that could be relaxed and undisturbed , with plenty of fun to follow the serious thinking . These are some of the resources of present-day Nela Park , enumerated here to give a preview of the fulfillment of Franklin S. Terry 's hopes and dreams . Terry lived with his job . During the earlier years he resided in a small frame house directly opposite the East 45th Street office building . At Nela Park he combined his home and his office , maintaining an apartment on the top floor of the Administration build-  | ing . Here he could keep in constant contact with the business and with his friends throughout the company . Fastidious in dress , fond of order and careful detail , Terry followed a strict personal regimen . One of his favorite forms of relaxation was to walk through the tree-covered ravine behind the building where he lived . On these walks he liked to be accompanied by one or another of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office routine and on a basis of friendship rather than brass-hat commands . His main interests in the lamp business were research , education , and more freedom and responsibility for employees , since he thought that freedom of action and the responsibility for the action went hand in hand . B. G. Tremaine maintained a lively interest in half a dozen other industrial fields . Financial management was his forte . When Terry and others presented a major suggestion in a management meeting , Tremaine usually sat quietly listening to the enthusiastic " idea selling . " Often there were alternative proposals vigorously backed by their sponsors . At a suitable moment Tremaine pinpointed the most pertinent factors involved in reaching a decision . With one or two questions he helped the group reach the most practical solution . Chief among his projects outside the lamp business was the operation of the Peerless Motor Car Co. , in which he and other National officers held a considerable financial interest . H. A. Tremaine left National in November , 1912 , to become treasurer of Peerless . The Crouses also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. B. Crouse becoming a vice-president of the automobile firm . J. Robert Crouse served as National 's sales manager from 1912 until his resignation in 1916 . T. W. Frech was also an active manager of Peerless for several years before returning to the lamp business . As a result of these changes the management of the National Lamp Works was left almost entirely to F. S. Terry and B. G. Tremaine from the time the business was established in its new headquarters . Meanwhile a whole new generation of capable men was grow-  | ing up in the business . Terry and Tremaine were quick to recognize that the pioneers in lampmaking must be succeeded by younger men even better trained than the " Old Guard . " The transition should be planned , not haphazard . They looked to the colleges and universities for new talent . Early in the National company 's development they set up an Employment Committee for the selection of outstanding graduates who would adopt the lamp business as a career . The committee included executives in sales , engineering , and manufacturing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly notable in 1909 and 1910 . In each of these years more than 5o such young men entered the company . The same was true of the Edison Lamp Works at Harrison . It has been most interesting to see how many managers and key men in the General Electric Lamp Division came from this farsighted manpower-building program . The National management organized two companies in 1911 to operate an investment and profit-sharing plan for department managers and other key employees . The original capital stock of these investment funds totaled more than half a million dollars . Profit-sharing was not confined to Nela Park personnel , but extended to sales , service , and manufacturing people throughout the country , who were accomplishing so much to maintain the company 's position . For many years the profit-sharing plan supplied an unequaled incentive toward initiative , responsibility , and plain hard work to improve the lamp business and the welfare of every employee . Nela Park gained nationwide recognition as a remarkable new venture in American industry . In 1913 the National Lamp Works won the top award for service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sanitation . In 1920 Nela Park was selected as " the best-kept plant in America " in a contest sponsored by a leading business magazine . Among the many elaborate entries submitted , the judges could find nothing in American industry to equal it . Even the value of Nela Park as a working place came to be  | transcended by its educational value in the field of lamps and lighting . For employees throughout the country , for people from electric-utility companies , for wholesalers and retailers of lighting equipment , and for the general public it became known as the most prolific source of lighting information ? truly a " university of light . "  | A New System of Business Management PEOPLE WORKING together for the benefit of all . By now that 's a cliche ? but what a wonderful idea when it 's expressed in action ! The New England town meeting is one example . There are dozens of others , such as the Red Cross , the Community Chest , or any organization that practices the idealistic principles it preaches . Many businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned is a welfare society , a church , or a business , lip service to the ideal is not enough . To mean anything it must be manifested in deeds and in beneficial results . And that 's not easy . The management of the National Lamp Works believed in this ideal . Furthermore , they realized that it could not be fulfilled in any business organization unless it was so blueprinted that the lines of constructive action would be clear to everyone involved . Simply saying " Let 's all work together " would n't do it . So they formulated the basic principles and policies they believed essential to successful business operation . The result was a new system of business management , quite different from the usual " line " type of organization . THE LINE ORGANIZATION The line system consists of a chain of command . Orders come from the top , filter through various levels , and so are carried out . Often , in order to get decisions on even minor questions , they must  | be passed in reverse order through much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line type of operation originated in the military that Terry and his associates disapproved it . " Warfare , " they said , " is destructive and inefficient ; business can not afford to be . " They also noted that the following deficiencies are typical of the line organizations in business : I. Development of new talent or new methods is not as effective as it should be , because the top leaders can not have enough contact with individuals . They must depend on recommendations coming through a long chain . Many good suggestions are lost or blocked on the way . 2 . The tendency is to promote individuals because they are " next in line " rather than on the basis of fitness for the work . 3 . Delays and red tape often result from the worker 's inability to act without referring minor matters to superiors in the chain of command . 4 . There is too much emphasis on winning grandiose titles , pleasing the boss , and building a complicated hierarchy of officials . These objectives take precedence over the only true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a department : accomplishing truly useful and satisfactory results on the job . 5 . Foremen and department managers are charged with responsibility for their operations but do not receive comparable authority to fulfill the requirements of their jobs . 6 . To sum up , there is too little opportunity to develop individual initiative and skill . The training of people to take on better jobs and more responsibility may bog down as a result . The objections of the National management to the line system of company formation have carried over for many years in the history of the G-E Lamp Division . Some years ago a factory manager in the Lamp Division discussed this with an interviewer . He talked about the thinking that led to adoption of another organizational method .  | " It 's hard to explain , " he said , " but we feel we have a different way of considering our common goals and evaluating the people working with us . " We regard the worker in business , at any and all levels , as a responsible and responsive individual . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're not always apparent , to be sure . And if he does n't have these normal human traits , it will usually show up pretty quickly . He ca n't make the grade and is n't worth keeping as an employee . " Usually , though , even if he 's just an average American with average talents , he has pride in his work . He holds a democratic belief in equal opportunity according to ability . He does n't enjoy just going through the motions in order to keep his job . He does n't mind taking orders from a boss he respects , but he wants to do more than take orders all the time . He wants some responsibility and the authority to carry it out ? not selfishly , at the expense of others , but in line with his own capacities . " That 's the attitude that builds leaders . Recognition of it by management builds both the business and the leaders it needs . That 's true in the factory , on the sales force , anywhere in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals and in their desire for responsibility and advancement . But the business will succeed best ? and its workers will progress best ? when there is a type of organization that encourages these qualities as much as possible . " That 's why the leaders of our business decided long ago to find new ways to build people ? not just to build things . They worked out a form of organization they thought would accomplish that better . " Now , most modern businesses want to encourage individual development along the lines I 'm implying . Many of them have the same objectives we have . But the important question is whether the management is able to move energetically toward those ends . We think that in the line system they 're stymied . We think that with our method we 're free to go ahead . "  | THE UNIT SYSTEM Instead of line organization the National Lamp Works chose what may be called the " unit system , " for want of a better name . The company structure was divided into units of such a size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally acquainted with each worker and well informed about his or her abilities , current and potential . The manager had full responsibility for his unit in every practical respect . If it produced favorable results according to welldefined measuring sticks , he received the credit . If it failed to produce satisfactory results he was also held primarily responsible . At the same time , the manager had full authority in all matters concerning his unit , except for such minimum authority as was specifically reserved for the general manager of the National Lamp Works . That was the key factor in making National 's organization different from the usual business operation . " That 's just the opposite , " the factory manager said , " of what you have in most companies . Usually it works this way : The top boss keeps all the authority except what he turns over specifically to the next guy in line . Then that fellow ? the sales manager , perhaps ? keeps all the power he can lay hands on except what he 's willing to give specifically to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The district manager is told when he takes his job , You can do these five things . Everything else must be passed on up the chain of command for approval . ' " In our business we try to eliminate titles and straw bosses between the general manager and the unit manager . Every unit manager is responsible directly to the general manager , and to him only , for the success of his unit 's operation . " The general manager reserves authority on matters affecting the business as a whole . If we 're going to bring out a new product , he has final jurisdiction ? not the factory manager who might produce that product in his plant . But if that factory manager needs to hire ten more girls as machine operators in order to reach the  | required production level , that 's his business . No one ? not even the general manager ? can forbid him to do so . All he has to do is to turn out the product at a certain high quality standard and a certain low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his performance . And believe me , those yardsticks are exact and they 've been worked out with his participation . " Suppose we 're temporarily short of a certain type of lamp because of material shortages at the factories . Then a district sales manager can sell only his fair percentage of the total current supply . The right of decision there is kept by the general manager . But the great majority of decisions can and must be made by the unit manager . " We call it the Authority Reserved ' system . Each unit manager gets what is in effect an Authority Reserved charter , restricted to a few basic points . That tells him what is under headquarters control . Beyond that he 's on his own , and he has plenty of room to move . " In modern business it is impossible to provide in advance for many of the problems that arise . The National Lamp Works management found that action to solve such problems without wasteful delays was much more likely under the Authority Reserved system than under a line operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass them on to a higher echelon . Just at the time when delay and buck-passing were most likely , this method could operate normally and smoothly . The difference also showed up in the spirit of the organization . Individuals enjoyed greater freedom of action . While Authority Reserved did not extend formally beyond the unit manager , in practice there was a strong tendency to pass it along to subordinates . A manager experienced the benefits of the system in his own work . Consequently he was likely to define to his section heads , foremen , etc. , the authority he reserved to himself ; then he allowed them to deal with all other matters that affected their operations . Ideally this extended to clerks , stenographers , machine operators , and all other employees . From the beginning the Nela Park departments were operated as services . It was not the function of a G-E Lamp headquarters office to direct the factories , sales districts , and other units  | throughout the country . Instead , it aided them in achieving their objectives . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important units in the business were the factories and the sales districts ? not Nela Park . The district employees and the factory employees could feel that the Nela Park people were backing them rather than trying to goad or drive . Terry , Tremaine , and T. W. Frech , as pioneers of the National business , constantly worked to sustain and implement this new type of business management . They found that it was successful , not only in profitable operation but in the unity , drive , and comradely spirit it produced .  | Distribution Plan and License Agreements S THE NATIONAL Lamp Works and the Edison Lamp Works assessed their situation in early 1912 , they found licensing and distribution problems that needed attention . The court decree of 1911 required changes in the marketing system for lamps and highlighted the questions of patents and licenses . These were separate questions . A new distribution system was not linked with patent licensing , but both had to be reviewed at this time . A NEW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM The 191 I decree had forbidden the fixing of resale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general classes of customers : ( 1 ) large consumers ; ( 2 ) wholesalers and retailers , who resold the lamps to consumers ; and ( 3 ) electric-utility companies , which resold to consumers or used the so-called " free renewal " plan . It was important to the manufacturers to see that the ultimate consumer received the right lamp for each purpose . The question now was how to maintain the best possible manufacturerconsumer relations in the use of the product . General Electric decided to work out an entirely new plan of distribution . Adam Page , Edison sales manager , was largely responsible for conceiving the agency-distribution plan . One type of sale was not affected by the new system : direct purchase contracts between General Electric and a large consumer . For example , a salesman from a General Electric district office 103  | might conclude a purchase agreement with the owner of a large factory . All the lamps used by the factory over a year 's time would be subject to that contract . No agent would be involved . Many sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , a company called the Sterling Electric Supply Co. of Stamford , Conn. , dealing in electrical goods at the wholesale level , might want to serve as an agent for lamp bulbs made by G.E . Sterling would deal with two kinds of customers : large consumers , such as a local factory ; and dealers in electrical goods , such as the Acme Electric Store in the nearby town of Riverside . Under the agency plan started in 1912 , Sterling would be designated as a " B " agent for General Electric lamps . Sterling would represent G.E . in getting a lamp contract from the factory . Sterling would also represent G.E . in arranging the appointment of Acme Electric as a retail agent for General Electric lamps . In neither case would Sterling own the lamps , but would receive them on consignment and then supply the necessary service to customers ? stocking , delivery as needed , credit , etc . The Acme Electric Store would act as an " A " agent for General Electric . Shoppers coming into the store could buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acme would supply the lamps from a consigned stock owned by G.E . This , in essence , was the agency plan . There were various subclasses of agents and many ramifications of procedure , but the two main types of agency were " B " and " A. " The lamps all belonged to General Electric until sold to a user by an agent or placed in use by the agent for his own needs . The agent simply represented G.E . and provided the local services required to serve the consumer . An agent received compensation from General Electric for the many services he performed for G.E. ? display of the lamps in his place of business , delivery to consumers , etc . The compensation paid made it good business for agents at both the wholesale and the retail level . Agency contracts grew to be somewhat complicated because of the many types of wholesalers and retailers . General Electric worked out a set of sales rules to be followed by Edison and Na-  | tional salesmen . Then , to referee the application of these sales rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined contracts to see that they conformed with the correct legal and commercial practice . He ruled on hundreds of questions that arose in the heat of competitive selling , such as whether a particular firm was entitled to a " B " agency or an " A " agency , and so on . Under its license , Westinghouse was required to sell on terms and at prices that were not more favorable than General Electric 's . However , this applied only to lamps made under G-E patents . And Westinghouse was not required to use an agency plan . Nevertheless , the advantages of the agency system were apparent and Westinghouse adopted the same type of distribution system . The license provided that if Westinghouse used the agency plan , it would not offer better terms to its agents than G.E . offered to General Electric agents . The supervisor 's office received the Westinghouse agency contracts for review and the supervisor acted on them just as he did with General Electric agency appointments . The Department of Justice was fully informed of the details of the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully satisfied that it was adopted in good faith . The agency system brought advantages to the public , to the agents , and to the manufacturers who employed it . Consumers enjoyed the assurance of getting top-quality lamps at established prices . They could be certain , too , that full-scale research would continue to improve quality further and bring about better and better lighting . In effect the public was also insured against cheapening of the product , which would add considerably to the cost of light . Lamps themselves account for only a small part of that cost . A slight decrease in lamp efficiency , however , can materially increase the unit cost of light because of poor utilization of electric current . So the consumer 's stake in lamp quality is high . Agents handling the lamps were assured of compensation at a steady , reasonable rate . They had no investment to make ? no tie-up of capital in lamp stocks . Maintained quality of product  | meant greater public acceptance and more agency compensation earned . There was no risk by the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small agent sold at the same price as the large agent . To General Electric the agency plan represented similar advantages . It meant a stable price structure throughout the marketing chain ; the maintenance of continued research for product improvement ; and a strong distribution system because of satisfied agents at all levels of distribution . THE WESTINGHOUSE " A " LICENSE The patent for Dr. Whitney 's Gem lamp had been issued in 1909 . The Just and Hanaman patent , covering tungsten lamps , was granted in February , 1912 . Dr. Coolidge 's final patent application on the ductile-tungsten lamp was almost ready ( applied for in July , 1912 , and patent issued in December , 1913 ) . Westinghouse wanted to continue making lamps under the General Electric patents . So on March 1 , 1912 , G.E . granted Westinghouse a new license covering the patented lamps . This agreement was called the " A " license . It specified the percentage that Westinghouse could produce of the total number of patented lamps made by the two companies . Manufacturer 's prices and terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be more favorable than General Electric 's . A royalty rate was established , which Westinghouse paid to G.E . on the Westinghouse lamps made under General Electric patents . A new feature of this license was the permission Westinghouse received to use the MAZDA trademark on lamps conforming to MAZDA service standards . This meant that Westinghouse would receive the benefits of General Electric lamp research as these were introduced though the MAZDA system . Since this was a cross licensing agreement , G.E . would also have the right to utilize improvements in products and manufacturing methods devised by Westinghouse in the lamp field . As stated before ( Chapter 7 ) , MAZDA was the mark of a service , not the name of a product . Westinghouse identified itself as  | the manufacturer of its MAZDA lamps by calling them " Westinghouse MAZDA lamps . " In the same way , General Electric 's two major lamp divisions identified their MAZDA products as " Edison MAZDA " and " National MAZDA . " ( Not until about 25 years later was the name " G-E MAZDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by General Electric . ) Not all lamps made by these companies were entitled to the MAZDA trademark ? far from it . A type of lamp that was , so to speak , a candidate for MAZDA honors had to be submitted to the careful scrutiny of Hawkins and Fisher at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady . Along with it went the details about its fabrication . Not until the MAZDA service authorities agreed that the lamp was produced with the benefits of " the latest and best research and manufacturing techniques " did it receive the MAZDA mark . THE " B " LICENSES At this time many relatively small manufacturers were making tungsten lamps without patent rights . Obviously the validity of General Electric 's tungsten-lamp patents had to be established Therefore G.E . brought suit against one of the infringers , the Laco-Philips company , in the Federal courts . ( Laco-Philips did not make lamps in the United States but sold a sizable volume of imported tungsten bulbs . ) This action resulted in a decision upholding the Just and Han aman patent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1916 . An appeals court agreed with this decision a few months later . General Electric now faced a difficult problem . G.E . could put several manufacturers out of business because they were making and selling tungsten lamps that infringed the General Electric patents . If the management had desired to entrench the company firmly in a monopoly position , here was a remarkable opportunity to do so . Proceeding against the infringers would be perfectly justified under the law . But the company did not want to take this step against firms that  | had made substantial investments and employed fairly large staffs of workers . Instead , G.E . offered licenses to companies that had been in business prior to the court decision against Laco-Philips . These companies were called " B " licensees . Each licensee could manufacture lamps under G-E patents , the amount to be a certain percentage of the total number of patented lamps made by General Electric and the licensee combined . The licensees were free to set their own prices and terms of sale . Most of the companies concerned made either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so licensed . Two of them received licenses for both large and miniature lamps . The licenses specified a royalty rate to be paid to G.E . on patented lamps made by the licensees . Since the sales quotas were figured on an annual basis , the business of a licensee could grow each year in proportion to the growth of General Electric lamp sales . The " B " licensees did not receive the right to use the MAZDA trade-mark . Altogether , eight companies received " B " licenses in 1916 , and 24 more during the next nine years . Many of these companies were consolidated with others as time went on . In almost all cases , when one company bought another , G.E . allowed the purchasing company to take over the license of the company purchased . Through the licenses General Electric brought to almost the entire industry the remarkable advances in lampmaking that had been achieved from 1904 to 1916 . Most of these had resulted from General Electric research . The others had been acquired by G.E . in its continual efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances .  | Pure Science and Applied Science GENERAL ELECTRIC carried on two types of research and development in the lamp business . One was fundamental scientific inquiry conducted without regard to product . The other comprised the direct improvement of products , parts , machinery , and manufacturing techniques ? in other words , applied research having commercial objectives . The first of these activities was of course typified by the General Electric Research Laboratory . One of the leading figures in the history of the laboratory appeared on the scene July 19 , 1909 . That was the day when Irving Langmuir , a z9-year-old chemist , first went to work at Schenectady . He had won a degree in metallurgical engineering at Columbia University in 1903 . He had studied chemistry under Nernst for three years at the University of Gottingen in Germany , where he received his Ph.D. , and then had taught at Stevens Institute of Technology before joining Whitney , Coolidge , and the other General Electric scientists . Dr. Whitney turned Langmuir loose to select any problem in the laboratory that he wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackening of lamp bulbs on the test racks ; as they darkened , the lamps emitted less and less light . He decided to explore the problem of blackening . The getters used up to that time ( see Chapter 7 ) reduced bulb blackening somewhat but it remained a most troublesome phenomenon . The high vacuum did not eliminate all the gases in the atmosphere ; water vapor also remained in the bulbs in minute quantities . 109  | One of the most critical commentators on the lamp business has said of Langmuir 's self-selected assignment : " No specific commercial results were expected ; Langmuir merely hoped to learn more about the behavior of gases in incandescent lamps . " His studies continued for three years before he answered the questions he had asked himself . First he asked , " What gases are present in the vacuum bulbs ? " He found minute quantities of several different gases or vapors : oxygen , carbon dioxide , carbon monoxide , hydrogen , hydrocarbon vapor , nitrogen , and water vapor . Langmuir had to work out new methods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these gases in i cubic millimeter of total volume at atmospheric pressure . Second , he found that most of the gases had little or no discoloring effect . However , the presence of water vapor and the gradual evaporation of tungsten atoms from the filament resulted in a complicated cycle of blackening . In this little atomic dance even a microscopic amount of water vapor could cause a rather large amount of tungsten to be carried to the glass wall of the bulb . The vapor was renewed at the conclusion of each cycle and was ready to act again as a partner to the tungsten atoms in the darkening of the bulb . But which was the real offender ? the action of the water vapor or the evaporation of the filament ? To find out , Langmuir made tests in which lamps were kept completely immersed in liquid air . This prevented water vapor from coming into contact with the filament . The rate of blackening was exactly the same as before . These experiments led to two conclusions : The bulb blackening was due to evaporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eliminated by improving the vacuum even if it were possible to produce an absolutely perfect vacuum . FREEDOM OF RESEARCH Langmuir had worked steadily for two years to get this far ? and there were still many questions to be answered . His explanation of the work up to that time reveals not only his interesting  | " pure science " approach but the attitude of Dr. Whitney and the G-E management as well : " I really did n't know how to produce a better vacuum , and instead proposed to study the bad effects of gases by putting gases in the lamp . I hoped that in this way I could extrapolate to zero gas pressure and thus predict , without really trying it , how good the lamp would be if we could produce a perfect vacuum . " This principle of research I have found extremely useful on many occasions . When it is suspected that some useful result is to be obtained by avoiding certain undesired factors , but it is found that these factors are very difficult to avoid , then it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn so as to exaggerate their bad effects , and thus become so familiar with them that one can determine whether it is really worth while to avoid them . For example , if you have in lamps a vacuum as good as you know how to produce , but suspect that the lamps would be better if you had a vacuum , say , one hundred times as good , it may be the best policy , instead of attempting to devise methods of improving this vacuum , to spoil the vacuum deliberately in known ways and you may find then that no improvement in vacuum is needed or just how much better the vacuum needs to be . " During these first few years , while I was thus having such a good time satisfying my curiosity and publishing scientific papers on chemical reactions at low pressures , I frequently wondered whether it was fair that I should spend my whole time in an industrial organization on such purely scientific work , for I confess I did n't see what applications could be made of it , nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked the matter over with Dr. Whitney , saying that I could not tell where this work was going to lead us . He replied that it was not necessary , as far as he was concerned , that it should lead anywhere . He would like to see me continue working along any fundamental lines that would give us more information in regard to the phenomena taking place in incandescent lamps , and said that I should feel myself perfectly free to go ahead on any such lines that seemed of interest to mc . For nearly three years I worked in this way with several assistants before any real application was made of any of  | my work . In adopting this broad-minded attitude Dr. Whitney showed himself to be a real pioneer in the new type of modern industrial research . " GAS-FILLED LAMPS The third major step in Langmuir 's research was to study the rate of evaporation from tungsten filaments at different temperatures , both in vacuum and in inert gases at various pressures . He found that the presence of an inert gas such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of obstructing the path of the tungsten atoms on their way to the wall of the glass bulb . At the same time it helped to prevent the water vapor from picking up tungsten atoms and escorting them to the glass surface . This was fine , but scientists find that there are drawbacks to many of their findings that appear favorable . So it was with the effects of introducing an inert gas into the bulbs . The nitrogen increased the loss of heat from the filament , and this reduced the efficiency ( light output ) of the lamp . The decrease in efficiency was greater than the gain realized from a smaller amount of blackening . In effect Langmuir had taken one good stride forward , only to be pushed two steps backward . He still had to search for some additional factor that would create an over-all improvement . Some of the lamps made by Sawyer and Man , Farmer , and other early experimenters had used gas fillings . Edison had tried to develop a gas-filled lamp . But all these attempts , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the effects of gases in lamps until Langmuir 's explorations found the facts . As a final procedure he studied the loss of heat from small wires in gas . And here he made a key discovery : The heat loss caused by the gases did not increase proportionately as the size of the filament was increased . Of course there was an upper limit to this , but a larger filament could be used than had been thought feasible . The favorable effects of the gas filling would more than counterbalance the heat losses , and the larger filament would permit op-  | eration at higher temperature and therefore higher brightness . A gas-filled lamp could operate at about 25oo ? C , some 400 ? above the filament temperature in a vacuum lamp . Scarcely less significant was Langmuir 's finding that , if the filament was closely coiled , the diameter of the spiral coil was the determining factor in the loss of heat , rather than the diameter of the filament wire itself . Thus the increased efficiency of the new lamps he created , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination . Langmuir had set out simply to get as much information as possible about the effects of the various gases in existing lamp bulbs . He finished by developing a new type of lamp ? the first truly successful gas-filled incandescent lamp ? with vastly increased efficiency throughout its life . The first gas-filled tungsten lamps were introduced commercially by G.E . ( Edison and National ) in 1913 . They were called MAZDA C lamps to distinguish them from the vacuum ( MAZDA B ) lamps . The first sizes placed on the market were 750-watt and 1,000-watt bulbs . The increase in efficiency was greatest in these sizes . Also it was in these large bulbs that the necessary knowledge to make the application was first obtained . Later the laboratory and the factories learned how to apply the idea to other sizes : Zoo-watt through Soo-watt gas-filled lamps were introduced in 1914 ; the loo-watt bulb in 1917 ; and smaller sizes in later years , down to and including the standard 4o-watt bulb . Total efficiency over the rated life of the lamps was doubled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain was less but added greatly to lamp quality and cut the cost of light . The increase was 25 per cent in the 1oo-watt lamp , for example . The initial efficiency of the loo-watt gas-filled bulb was 12.5 lumens per watt ; in the 6o-watt lamp , 11.1 1pw . Dr. Langmuir applied for a patent on these lamps in April , 1913 , and it was granted three years later . He went on to dozens of other scientific achievements . The list of medals and other awards he has earned from learned societies is long and lustrous , topped by the Nobel prize in chemistry for 1932 . He thus joined  | the select group of which his former teacher , Walther Nernst , was a member . Nernst had won the same Nobel award in 1920 . From 1909 through 1915 the laboratory expended nearly $200,000 on Langmuir 's work and the development of gas-filled lamps . Yet this investment ? and the business structure that provided the research money ? proved amply justified . The years of effort by Langmuir and his assistants added millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the value total is still growing day by day and year by year . Gas-filled lamps found a ready market because of their much higher efficiency . They delivered a crushing blow to carbon-arc lighting except for a few specialized applications . Gas-filled lamps were much superior on all counts for street lighting , which had been a last outpost for extensive use of arc lighting . At first nitrogen was used in the new lamps , though Langmuir recognized and specified the value of argon gas for the purpose . After argon became commercially available in quantity ( from 1919 on ) most of the gas content in standard lamps was argon , mixed with a small quantity of nitrogen . NONSAG WIRE Meanwhile lamp development ? applied science as contrasted with pure science ? kept pace with the needs for better illumination . Just as blackening had been a thorny problem , so were the " offsetting " of tungsten crystals in the filament and the sagging of the coils in the coiled wire . Both of these difficulties quite often caused lamps to burn out before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and factory men were dissatisfied with the best product they knew how to make . So they kept on trying to learn how to make the lamps still better . The man who overcame these deficiencies demonstrated the infinite patience of the true scientist . He was Dr. Aladar Pacz of the Lamp Development Laboratory at Nela Park . He performed experiment after experiment ? 218 in all ? and finally arrived at a process that produced nonsag filament wire . The coils in this new  | type of wire remained properly separated , tiny fractions of an inch apart . Offsetting within the wire was greatly reduced , and there was much less breakage of filaments . Dr. Pacz made his patent application in February , 1917 , and the Patent Office approved it in March , 1922 . MAZDA service and a detailed standardizing procedure carried the needed information to the factories , so that such discoveries as gas-filled lamps and nonsag wire could be applied in mass production . Lampmaking could be standardized in the various factories by precise and thorough outlining of procedures , and this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division for many years . The results are uniformity and dependability of product , good cost control , and efficient training of factory employees . Standardizing helps maintain skill and knowledge throughout the manufacturing organization . BUILDING BETTER MACHINES Machine work moved forward rapidly during the years 1912 to 1917 . More than ever the work of lampmaking became the function of dependable automatic processing , leaving human hands and brains free to supervise and improve . To make lead-in wires , G-E experts developed a double electric-welding machine . They built an improved sealing-in machine , an automatic machine for inserting the wires supporting the filament , and an automatic exhaust machine . Cement for lamp bases was inserted automatically . The Equipment Works built more and more duplicates of these mechanical marvels as lamp demand soared and new factories came into existence . They built variations on each type as well , so that the making of miniature bulbs and specialized lamps would proceed as efficiently as the manufacture of standard large lamps . National , of course , had operated the Fostoria Glass Works prior to 191 I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other National plants . ( The same was true of the Providence Base Works at Providence , R.I. , which at that time was the only plant manufacturing a full line of lamp bases. )  | To further the research work in glass , the Glass Technology Laboratory was established at Cleveland in 1916 and the Glass Machine Works in 1919 . In 1912 the Empire Machine Co. , a subsidiary of Corning , developed a semiautomatic bulb-blowing machine . Here was the first in a long series of machines that were to pare costs and speed the production of bulbs phenomenally . General Electric obtained a license to make and use the Empire machine , and G-E technicians developed it further . Bulb output leaped to about 350 per hour per machine employing one skilled and two unskilled operators . At the Westlake Machine Co. , which was a property of the Libbey Glass Co. , machine designers toiled for several years to construct an even better bulb-blowing machine . The Westlake machine , completely automatic , was used on an experimental basis in 1917 and 1918 . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger share of bulb output , along with an improved , fully automatic Empire machine called the Empire " F. " G.E . also negotiated for a license on the Westlake development ( in 1918 ) . The men in the Glass Machine Works and the glass factories contributed many of the advancements that led to fully automatic operation . Carl A. Brown was a notable leader in this work . A new type of lime glass had to be formulated for use with these machines , in contrast to the lead glass formerly used for hand blowing . ( The shortage of potash during World War I also made the change necessary . ) The researchers in the Glass Technology Laboratory worked this out after much careful experimentation , along with similar investigation by Corning . Edward Danner of the Libbey Glass Co. obtained a patent in 1917 on an automatic machine for drawing glass tubing and cane . General Electric purchased the rights to this development so far as it pertained to lamp glass ; this was part of the license agreement concluded with Libbey for the Westlake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field improved all these machines , the output of bulbs and tubing mounted and costs  | dropped sharply . This was another prime example of applied science . From theoretical investigations to product development and factory improvements , General Electric was fulfilling the industry 's needs in both the Edison and the National Lamp Works . The company 's responsibilities to the public in the lamp business were being met here as well as in the fields of business management and marketing .  | Helping to Win Wartime Victories WHEN THE UNITED STATES entered World War I the nation was not well prepared . We lacked trained fighting men and badly needed munitions . Equally serious was the fact that there were no adequate plans and methods for utilizing American research , development , and manufacturing skills . However , America 's producers responded to the emergency in every way possible . Those in the lamp industry were typical in this respect . Men volunteered for the armed forces from the Edison and National plants and offices all across the country . Like their fellow Americans , many of them served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again like their compatriots , some gave their lives or were wounded in battle . The contributions of industry and of those ineligible for military service of course can not be compared to the sacrifices made by the men in uniform . Nevertheless , the lamp companies were among the first industrial organizations to offer their resources , scientific skill , and manpower to the government for whatever needs they could fill . Both the Edison and the National Lamp Works did this during the first few days after the declaration of war ( April 6 , 1917 ) . CHEMICAL WARFARE WORK One of the fields in which the Army asked for help was chemical warfare . The German army had used poison gas as early as  | April , 1915 . The Allied armies were not equipped to combat gas warfare . At first they used hastily prepared , makeshift respirators . Later they retaliated with their own gas attacks . When the United States entered the war there was need for efficient gas masks and for developments in all types of chemical warfare , from basic research all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works was enlisted by the government in this work in April , 1917 . National was associated with the National Carbon Co. in this effort , especially in the development work on gas masks . Several other chemical manufacturers participated in the production of offensive weapons . In the beginning this was under the direction of the Bureau of Mines . In charge of this activity for National was Frank M. Dorsey , a chemical engineer prominent in the work of the Lamp Development Laboratory . His chief assistant was Dale C. Hughes , and several others from the laboratory formed the central group around which the project grew . Dorsey served first as a civilian . Later he was sworn into the Chemical Warfare Service of the Army , along with a number of other Nela Park men . He received his commission as a colonel when this new branch of the Army was first organized in 1918 . He continued his work at Nela Park as chief of the Development Division of the Chemical Warfare Service . Other officers and men , some from National and some from outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total quartered at Nela Park reached about 250 . Several Nela Park personalities prominent in later years aided in the chemical warfare program . Dale Hughes managed a variety of assignments and completed his war service as a captain . Following the war he became secretary of the manufacturing committee at Nela Park and served in that capacity for more than 30 years . Leo G. Cover of the Cleveland Wire Works was another of Dorsey 's assistants , holding the rank of captain in the Chemical Warfare Service . After the war he returned to the Wire Works and advanced to the position of manager before his retirement in 1952 . Marvin Pipkin , who later was responsible for the development of inside frosting of lamps , was a young chemist serving as a private in the chemical warfare unit . His research work in the various  | projects was outstanding and after the war he joined the Lamp Development Laboratory staff . There were many others who willingly took on their assignments to this strange and difficult operation and then returned to the more prosaic but constructive job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of X rays may be said to have come into real prominence and usefulness during World War I. Here the men and women in lamp manufacturing found somewhat more familiar ground . The armed services greatly needed radio and X-ray tubes ? and these resembled highly complicated and expensive lamps . Not long before the United States declared war , Dr. Langmuir and his associates at Schenectady had developed much improved radio tubes . However , there was still only laboratory production . For that matter , no large-scale manufacturing of tubes existed anywhere in the country . Radio was still an infant industry in every sense . In August , 1917 , the Schenectady laboratory asked both the Edison and the National Lamp Works to help in carrying the work from the laboratory to volume production . W. R. Burrows at Harrison and W. H. Roberts at Nela Park assumed the task and their staffs plunged into this activity at once . As an important part of its contribution , the Edison Lamp Works cooperated with the Schenectady laboratory and the Providence Base Works in producing satisfactory bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamp Division headed the tubemanufacturing operations at Cleveland . He and his associates faced an enormously difficult production job . New methods and machines ? adapted from lampmaking practice ? had to be contrived for every step of manufacture . Scores of difficulties and seemingly conclusive failures marked the early weeks . Yet by the end of 1917 volume production of vacuum tubes was under way . On Jan. 4 , 1918 , the Vacuum Tube Division of General Electric was formally organized with Pritcli-  | and in charge , and with William T. Cogger as special engineer for the project . Manufacturing problems multiplied throughout the war period . New types of receiving and transmitting tubes were designed at frequent intervals . Each type brought new perplexities , but the lamp men learned how to step up tube life and quality . They filled the needs of the Signal Corps , the Navy , and other service arms . The tubes were used on ships and aircraft as well as at ground stations . New advances occurred almost daily in radiotelephone and radiotelegraph communications . The X-ray-tube program also originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated the effects of electrical discharges through a vacuum . His experiments resulted in the discovery of several previously unknown principles . With this knowledge as a basis , Dr. Coolidge built a radically new type of X-ray tube . The new tube was so satisfactory that the U.S. Army and the Red Cross immediately adopted it as the standard for use in their hospitals overseas . It now was possible also to fill the urgent need of the armed forces for portable X-ray equipment , to be mounted on trucks and used wherever required in the forward areas . Thus the Coolidge tube opened entirely new fields for X-ray usage in both military and civilian life . The tubes were manufactured at Schenectady on a small scale for several months . By April , 1918 , more volume had to be attained and the National organization was asked to help . Again W. H. Roberts , P. J. Pritchard , and their factory workers accepted the assignment . On May 7 the X-Ray Tube Division was organized . There were even fewer precedents for the manufacturing operations in this field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on schedule , made notable improvements in processing , and achieved excellent output figures during the remaining months of the war . Assembly of the many metal parts for the tube had been accomplished only by expert jewelers in the Schenectady laboratory . At Nela Park young women took over this work and became so dexterous at it that they almost doubled the assembly rate of the skilled laboratory employees .  | The new X-ray products contributed much to the treatment of troops during the war and in the immediate postwar period . They also provided a great impetus to effective use of X rays throughout the field of medicine after the war . OTHER WARTIME ACTIVITIES The outbreak of war demonstrated to the Allied nations how great had been their dependence on German research laboratories and manufacturing plants for many essential products . One of the most important of these was optical glass . The armed services had to obtain lenses of high quality for range finders , field glasses , periscopes , and similar instruments , all of which had been supplied almost entirely from Europe and particularly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the direction of W. M. Clark , cooperated with Bausch &; Lomb and other manufacturers in this country to help develop better optical glass . The Nela Research Laboratory , headed by Dr. Edward P. Hyde , intensively studied all types of field glasses for the National Research Council , which was the wartime agency supervising scientific work for the armed forces . Lt. Col. Robert A. Millikan made the original N.R.C. request for the study of binocular and monocular glasses . This was of course the noted Dr. Millikan who was to win the Nobel prize in physics in 1923 . Even before his inquiry ? and two weeks before the declaration of war ? Dr. Hyde had offered the complete facilities of the laboratory to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker . The Nela Research Laboratory also developed new signal lamps and complete light-signaling units for the War Department . Matthew Luckiesh of the laboratory staff studied camouflage problems and made recommendations for aircraft , ships , and ground installations . Flares and rockets were other subjects for experimental work in the laboratory . The Engineering Department designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new pro-  | cedures for testing the tubes . The engineers also developed landing lights and signal lights for airplanes , searchlights , many types of indicator lights for instrument panels , motor-vehicle lights , and gunsight lamps . They solved problems in camouflage , in the illumination of landing fields for night flying , and in protective lighting for industry to prevent sabotage and theft . These , together with many projects in testing and the creation of new light-measuring instruments , kept the staffs well occupied at both Harrison and Nela Park . The Standardizing Department aided in the designing of the new lamps required in all branches of warfare . The Chemical Laboratory found its opportunities to serve in the chemical warfare projects . In fact , every department was engaged in the war effort to some degree . Production of lamps for civilian use was curtailed , of course , but both Edison and National supplied the normal products essential to maintaining the nation 's economy . While the achievements of the lamp companies were no more praiseworthy than those of many other industries , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to prove highly important when the years of uncertain peace led to a second world war .  | The Benefits of Never-ending Research  --  OT EVEN a world war could stop the public desire for more and better lighting nor halt the phenomenal expansion of . the lamp business . In 1919 the industry produced more than 224 million large lamps with a manufacturer 's value of $48 million . This was two and a half times as many lamps as American manufacturers had turned out in 1914 . Even this total did not include about $3 million worth of Gem , tantalum , and other specialized types of large lamps , nor about $6 million worth of miniature lamps . So the value of all electric lamps made in 1919 ran to more than $57 million . As an industry leader , General Electric had to contend with a familiar problem , patent infringement by unlicensed manufacturers . G.E . took legal action during the early 1920 'S to establish the validity of the Langmuir and Coolidge patents and to end some of the infringements . The Langmuir patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1919 , and sustained on appeal in June , 1920 . The Coolidge patent on ductile tungsten was also held valid in June , 1920 . Some years later in another case the courts ruled that the article claims of this patent were invalid but upheld the method claims . In other words , G.E . could not successfully claim that a product ( such as a radio tube ) using ductile tungsten infringed the patent , though the process of producing ductile tungsten was protected by the patent . In any case , G.E . was able to proceed against a dozen infringing lamp manufacturers and bring their violations to at least a temporary halt .  | MORE ADVANCES IN LAMP DESIGN From Edison 's time on , large lamps ( that is , lamp bulbs for general lighting use ) had been made with a small , rather sharp tip of glass at the large end of the bulb . This was where the exhaust tube had been connected to the bulb . When the heated glass was sealed off and the exhaust tube removed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eliminate or avoid it , except through a very expensive process . There had been a few tipless lamps , such as the bulb marketed by Herman J. Jaeger in 1903 and for a few years thereafter . General Electric manufactured the Meridian lamp from 1906 to 1911 , and this had a tipless construction originally patented by H. D. Burnett and Samuel E. Doane in 1894 . Their idea was not commercially usable until it was improved in 1906 through a machine invention made by Mark H. Branin of the Edison Lamp Works . The Meridian lamp was a decorative type designed to compete with the Nernst lamp ( see Chapter 7 ) and was not manufactured in large quantities . The Jaeger and Meridian tipless constructions were too costly to be employed for more than a few specialized lamps . Both used an exhaust tube inserted in the stem of the lamp . For many years lamp men had wanted to get rid of that sharp tip . It caused breakage ; people sometimes injured themselves on it ; all in all , it was a nuisance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park : L. E. Mitchell and A. J. White . They devised an ingenious improvement on the Jaeger and Burnett-Doane methods . The exhaust tube was inserted in the stem while the stem was being made ( instead of afterward , as in Jaeger 's lamp ) and the bulb could be readily exhausted mechanically at the stem end . The tipless lamp was now economical to make . It was safer , less liable to break , betterlooking , and gave better distribution of light . In March , 1919 , Mitchell and White applied for patents on the method and the machine they had developed . Patent Office approval was granted  | in July , 1922 . The tipless construction quickly became standard for all general-purpose lamps . A few years later General Electric effected another major lamp improvement : inside frosting . This , along with tipless construction , brought the appearance of the lamps up to what millions of consumers recognize today as a standard lamp bulb . Prior to 1925 the great majority of bulbs were made of clear glass . One could see the stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was glare ? lots of it ! To reduce this annoying , possibly dangerous glare , General Electric research men tried several methods of treating the glass bulb . The frosted or enameled lamps they developed came on the market and did offer certain advantages , but there were disadvantages that equaled or perhaps overbalanced the benefits except for a few specialized uses . The use of white glass or white enamel coatings cut down glare and distributed light more evenly than clear glass but resulted in sizable reductions in light output ? averaging about 15 per cent . Frosting bulbs on the outside ( by etching the glass with acid or by sandblasting ) also cut efficiency . The loss of light was about 10 per cent . Furthermore , this method left a rough exterior surface that collected dust and dirt ; efficiency over the life of the lamp fell even further as a result . When the laboratory men tried frosting the inside of the bulb by treating it with acid they found that this weakened the glass so much that breakage became a serious problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , and the bulbs were too fragile for ordinary handling . Marvin Pipkin of the Lamp Development Laboratory continued experimenting with inside frosting . He tried something that apparently did n't make sense , but it worked ! If a structure is weakened by a certain treatment , most people would conclude that doing the same thing a second time would merely weaken it further . But Pipkin did n't jump to this conclusion . He had some distrust of the certainty of the obvious . He took some lamps that had been subjected to one inside-frosting treatment with acid ? and gave them another one . This was delib-  | erate , not frivolous or accidental . Pipkin had carefully analyzed the effects of the first acid bath . He had reason to believe that the second treatment might have different effects . And the results certainly were different . The second acid etching smoothed off the glass , rounded out the crevices , and produced a strong , evenly frosted surface . Others had suspected this before , but Pipkin was the first to make a thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beneficial effects . The patent he applied for in June , 1925 , was granted in October , 1928 . Besides the strength of the inside-frosted bulb , its better appearance , the reduction of glare , and the improved distribution Figure  | of light , this new product maintained high efficiency . Total light output was only 1 to 1% per cent less than that of a clear glass lamp . The other advantages far outweighed this slight decrease . Inside frosting was adopted for standard lamps , and a large majority of all lamp bulbs sold from 1925 on had this improvement . The research men created many other new types of lamps during this period . A complete list would be too lengthy here , but the following are typical : New types of motion-picture projection lamps ( 1920 and the following years ) Lamps for airport and cross-country airway lighting ( 1921 and later years ) Depressible-beam automobile headlight lamps with two filaments for " driving " and " passing " beams ( 1924 ) Lamp design had advanced immeasurably since 1907 , not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as specialized commercial and industrial needs , railroad lights , sign lighting , decorative illumination , and new uses for miniature lamps . PROGRESS IN LAMP ASSEMBLY W. R. Burrows , the factory-operations expert of the Edison Lamp Works , revolutionized the manufacturing system at Harrison during the years 1918-1921 . Until that time every operation in lampmaking was separate and distinct . Each department handled one step in the manufacturing process ; there was a department for stem-making , another for filament-mounting , a third for exhaust , etc . Various departments had different rates of production . Partly assembled lamps had to be stored temporarily until the next department was ready to handle them ; that took a lot of floor space in the factory . Lamps had to be carried from one department to another , and this increased the chances of breakage or misalignment . Burrows saw an opportunity to change this system for the  | better . " Why not , " he thought , " split up the operations differently ? Let 's have a unit that builds lamps from start to finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in a designated factory space . We can synchronize the machines and the various processes more closely and keep an even flow of lamps going . We 'll eliminate much of our temporary storage problem . Then in the next area we 'll set up another complete unit and so on ? complete units instead of specialized departments . " It sounded easier than it was in practice . Burrows anticipated that and simply kept working at it until , after three years , he had the unit system . The results were excellent in terms of increased output at the Harrison plant . In the early stages of the switch to the unit-production system , productivity per man-hour almost doubled . Over-all output , including the time of all production workers , reached 18 lamps per man-hour as compared to about ro previously . A unit employing five operators to handle practically all the lamp-assembly processes could turn out about 350 lamps per hour . The savings in floor space were also impressive . Machine developments multiplied during the years after World War I in both National and Edison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at high speed ; a machine to make stems for the tipless construction ; one to make hot-cut flares for stems ; another to coil filaments ? an important step . In 1924 the Sealex machine appeared , to exhaust the bulbs , fill them with gas , and seal them . Various mechanical steps accomplished the inside frosting , the sealing of several sizes of bulbs , improved coiling and filament mounting , and faster , better basing of lamps . Machine speeds were increased from time to time , so that a complete lampmaking unit could work in marvelously synchronized fashion . AUTOMATIC BULB-BLOWING The years after World War I saw startling gains in the making of glass bulbs for lamps . The Empire " F " and Westlake machines , constantly improved by technicians of General Electric and the  | glass companies , made practically all bulb-blowing automatic . These were rotary machines . As each machine revolved once it produced 12 , 24 , or 48 bulbs , depending on the number of blowing units in the mechanism . In the middle twenties it was possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single machine of the most advanced type . The process of drawing glass tubing became more efficient as the result of combining the Danner and Peiler machine developments . ( See Chapter 12 for mention of the Danner machine . ) Karl E. Peiler of the Hartford-Empire Co. , a Corning enterprise , obtained a patent in 1926 on improvements in tube-drawing machinery . The Danner and Peiler ideas were combined in the final development known as the Danner-Peiler machine . General Electric invested about $400,000 in the perfecting of this machine over a period of several years . This work accounted for an increase from an original output of 2,000 pounds of tubing in 24 hours to a capacity of about 18,000 pounds . Perhaps the most epochal advance in lamp-glass technology started in 1927 , when Corning introduced an entirely new type of bulb-making unit ? the ribbon machine . This extraordinary invention took a continuous ribbon of glass from the furnace and automatically blew bulbs in molds moving along a conveyor line that was part of the huge machine . General Electric and Corning engineers improved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working steadily in the Glass Machine Works and the Glass Technology Laboratory , the General Electric specialists ironed out the " bugs " and stepped up the machine 's capacity . Development was slow , and most of the excitement about it during these years was behind the scenes . The first ribbon machine placed in production by G.E . was not installed until 1933 and was not placed in full operation until 1934 . The machines that came out of this research were truly remarkable . They increased bulb output beyond the wildest estimates the glass experts could have imagined in 1925 . A perfected ribbon machine could produce about 5o,000 bulbs per hour , attended by an operator and several mechanics .  | APPLICATION ENGINEERING The lamps made by G.E . were more efficient than ever before . But it was not enough simply to turn out the best possible product . General Electric lamp men recognized their obligation to help customers use the lamps to best advantage . Furthermore , good application engineering has always been a valuable method of market development . Illuminating engineering is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art and physiology and psychology mixed up with the engineering . People instinctively like light , but not many are good judges of what kind of lighting will be most suitable for their needs . So illuminating engineers have to be especially cognizant of intangible factors . At the same time , the physical horizons of their field keep moving farther along . Any conscientious lighting engineer will say , when pressed , something like this : " Well , yes , we know a lot more about brightness and eye comfort and the mechanics of providing good illumination today than we did lo years ago . We feel that we can prescribe very well for most lighting needs . But the more we learn , the more we realize that we have n't reached perfection . We get to know 98 out of too answers . Then we find that the number of questions just naturally expands to , let 's say , 104 . So we go ahead trying to close that perpetual little gap . " The fact remains that before the engineer can philosophize and explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mastered the tools and the basic knowledge that have evolved over the years . The lighting engineer 's basic tool is the light meter ? an instrument that measures the quantity of light falling on a surface or in a certain plane . Quantity of light is no more important than quality of lighting , but it usually comes first in the engineer 's thinking because , to see at all , we must have a certain amount of light . Also , various seeing tasks require certain minimum amounts of light if we are to see comfortably and efficiently .  | Light meters of many different kinds and sizes have been devised in the last 40 years . However , easily portable meters were much needed for a long time . Some of the first practical solutions for this need were developed by C. F. Sackett and his associates in the Nela Park Engineering Department in 1917 . Following World War I these meters came into widespread use , were perfected further , and gave many an engineer " on the job " a means of determining lighting requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and standards , became known over his 4o-year service in the Engineering Department as a first-class authority on these and many other measuring instruments . One of the secrets of recommending good lighting successfully is demonstration . In 1919 , as part of the Lighting Research Laboratory , demonstration rooms for residential lighting were set up at Nela Park . Today they would seem crude and oldfashioned , but for their time they represented the best in home lighting . They served to show people throughout the lighting industry what to suggest for the customer . In 1920 Ward Harrison and Earl A. Anderson originated the lumen or room index method of general lighting design . This system of prescribing lighting took into account the proportions of the room to be lighted , the color of walls and ceiling , the distribution of light from various types of lighting fixtures , etc . The method Harrison and Anderson evolved greatly simplified procedure in lighting design and made the science much more exact . To take the benefits of engineering research to the public , the Nela Park management established a magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first issue of Light Magazine appeared . Roscoe E. Scott was the managing editor and John R. Colville the technical editor . The editor in chief was Dr. Charles A. Eaton , who had been active in industrial-relations work at Nela Park . Dr. Eaton had filled several responsible positions as a writer and editor and had served as a clergyman in a leading Cleveland church . In late 1924 , after leaving General Electric , he was elected to the House of Representatives from a New Jersey district . He served continuously in Congress for 28 years , winning acclaim for  | his leadership as the ranking Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . Besides Light Magazine , the engineers found another way to tell the world about better lighting . In the summer of 1923 they established the Nela School of Lighting in a building now known as the Advertising building . This was the forerunner of the G-E Lighting Institute , and it provided a training center for groups from all over the country : General Electric field representatives , sales agents at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , architects , and consulting engineers . Lee C. Kent headed this activity at Nela Park for more than 25 years and established one of the finest records of achievement ever known in the lighting industry . He was aided by a staff that changed frequently as its individual talents came into demand in other departments of the business , but always there was competent , smooth operation under Kent 's direction . At Harrison the Edison Lamp Works had also been working on a demonstration center to train salesmen and sell higher standards of illumination . Under George H. Stickney , manager of engineering , the Edison Lighting Institute was established with Arthur F. Loewe as director , and with the help of Alston Rodgers , A. S. Turner , Jr. , Helen G. McKinlay , and Lillian Eddy among others . National and Edison engineers turned out a profusion of engineering bulletins that informed the electrical trade and the public about the latest research findings and their practical applications . At Harrison these publications included contributions by such men as Alvin L. Powell , George H. Stickney , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar P. Anderson , and many others . Their opposite numbers at Nela Park kept the presses busy , too : Samuel Doane , Ward Harrison , George S. Merrill , Herbert Magdsick , Willard C. Brown , Walter Sturrock , and Charles E. Weitz come to mind as examples , though it would take much more space to name all the men whose studies were advancing the art of illuminating engineering . The engineering accomplishments of this period and later years made individual names unimportant .  | Always important , and probably the most effective force in bringing better lighting to the public , were the nationwide staffs of National and Edison engineers , salesmen , and agents in the field . Backed by advertising that had made MAZDA a household word ? synonymous with lamp bulbs ? these people represented General Electric in the vital direct contacts with customers . The quality of their day-by-day work could often determine the company 's progress in the lamp business . The record of consumer acceptance and sales proved that they were doing a superlative job .  | Final Steps toward Unified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency system of lamp sales had been functioning effectively . At Harrison , George C. Osborne succeeded Adam Page as sales manager of the Edison Lamp Works . Page moved to the administrative offices of G.E . in New York City . Osborn was assisted by Edwin E. Potter , Walter H. Thompson , and a nationwide sales staff . At Nela Park , Joseph E. Kewley in the Administration Department headed all marketing activities from 1925 on . W. G. McKitterick , as manager of the Sales Department , headed a strong team in the home office , as well as more than 25 managers and assistant managers in the divisional sales offices . Albert S. Terry acted as supervisor , reviewing the lamp contracts concluded under the agency system . In this position he was located at Harrison . Terry was a veteran of the lamp business , having been secretary and treasurer of the Sunbeam Incandescent Lamp Co. from 1892 until the formation of National . In addition to the agency system , the " A " and " B " licensing arrangements had been in successful operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again involved in legal problems . // In 1922 a committee of the New York state legislature held a series of hearings to determine whether the state 's antitrust laws 135  | were being violated . Lamp manufacturing was one of the industries about which the committee received complaints ( in regard to patents , licensing , and the agency system ) . During the hearings G.E . was not permitted by the committee to answer charges made against the company . So General Electric , to make its position and its practices perfectly clear , asked the Attorney General of the United States to investigate thoroughly . If there were any doubts about the legality of its operations , the company wanted to clear them up and take any action necessary to assure conformance with the antitrust laws . The Attorney General had reviewed the agency plan at the time it was first put into effect . The Federal Trade Commission had also investigated the agency system in 1919 and had taken no action , indicating that the commission did not disapprove . In its letter to the Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part : " If the charges made are true , the General Electric Company is a violator of the Federal law and should be dealt with accordingly . If the charges are not true , while the Company has no legal redress , at least it should not be condemned by the American people . " Inasmuch as these charges come directly under your jurisdiction , we invite you to investigate them , and if you are in doubt as to the legality of any of our acts , to bring an appropriate proceeding in a court where we may be heard , in order that the matter may be determined . " As a result of the company 's request and the investigation that followed , the government filed a civil suit against G.E . and Westinghouse under the Sherman antitrust law . This was in late March , 1924 . The case was brought before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in Cleveland . After a full hearing , the court dismissed the case on April 3 , 1925 . This of course was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court . There the court 's opinion , written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft , affirmed the action of the lower court . It stated that the license agreement between G.E . and  | Westinghouse was entirely legal and that the agency system conformed fully to the law . MANAGEMENT LEADERS Changes in leadership naturally occurred from time to time at Nela Park and Harrison . In 1916 George Morrison had been elected to a G.E . vice-presidency . W. R. Burrows succeeded him as manager of the Edison Lamp Works . The administrative group working with Burrows included thoroughly experienced managers such as Frank W. Patterson , Henry B. Rogers , and Carl T. Fuller . Thomas J. McIntyre , attached to the Harrison headquarters , functioned as a liaison man between Edison and National . He was the secretary of the policy-making committees on which both groups were represented . At Nela Park both F. S. Terry and B. G. Tremaine were looking toward retirement by 1921 , and wanted to turn over the active management of National to other hands . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning . Terry served as chairman and Tremaine as vicechairman . T. W. Frech became National 's general manager ? the active top administrator of the business . Other prominent figures in the Administration Department during the next few years were Leroy P. Sawyer , William H. Roberts , Dr. Zay Jeffries , Edwin Irving , and , as mentioned before , Joseph E. Kewley . In 1926 Sawyer moved to the G-E headquarters in New York City . Roberts headed all manufacturing , while Dr. Jeffries acted as consultant on major problems of research and development . William L. Enfield , who had succeeded John Randall as manager of the Lamp Development Laboratory , continued in that capacity . In 1923 both Terry and Tremaine moved further toward less active participation in the day-to-day management . They were satisfied that Frech was handling his job in excellent fashion . Terry was named as a General Electric vice-president and Tremaine was elected to the company 's board of directors . Mr. Tremaine continued as a director for 22 years , retiring in 1945 three years  | before his death at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate enough to see the later progress of the business he had done so much to establish . He died suddenly in 1926 , but he had the satisfaction of knowing that the National management was continuing along the lines he had marked so clearly ? business idealism , research , effective salesmanship , and the Authority Reserved method of management . Meanwhile the top management of the General Electric Company had also changed . E. W. Rice , the brilliant technical director , became president upon the retirement of Charles Coffin in 1913 , and guided the company through the difficult war years . In 1922 Gerard Swope took over the presidency and Owen D. Young became chairman of the board . Swope had worked , at $I a day , as a helper in the G-E repair shop at the World 's Fair in Chicago in 1893 . This was during the summer between his second and third years at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Later , with Western Electric , he rose through the ranks to become a vice-president . He moved to General Electric as president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election to the top position in the parent company . In 1912 Coffin had persuaded Owen Young , an exceptionally gifted lawyer , to join the company as general counsel . In that post he was soon made a vice-president . MOVING TOWARD CONSOLIDATION As a new generation succeeded to the leadership of many departments in Edison and National , a gradual recognition of the need for consolidation developed . Within General Electric , the Edison and National managements were largely independent . Their friendly rivalry had its advantages and its handicaps . The two groups shared technical knowledge with each other . They met together in committees for joint planning . They grew to know and like each other in sessions on Association Island . But inevitably there was some duplication of effort and of facilities . It became apparent that a stronger , more efficient organization could be built by complete consolidation .  | The statistics measuring growth in the lamp business kept going along an upward curve . The $57 million in total annual volume for all manufacturers in 1919 had expanded to about $73 million by 1925 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the output reached 273 million six years later . Production of miniature lamps shot upward from 85 million in 1921 to 18o million in 1925 . The job of welding National and Edison into one organization with headquarters at Nela Park was a formidable one . It could not be accomplished immediately , nor even in one year . As it turned out , six years ( 1925 ? 1931 ) were required before the many changes were finally completed . THE NEW INCANDESCENT LAMP DEPARTMENT The name chosen for the new combination was the Incandescent Lamp Department of General Electric . The manufacturing divisions ? and those closely related to manufacturing ? were brought together first . This was largely accomplished in 1925 and 1926 , though not entirely finished until 1930 . In the fall of 1925 Frank W. Patterson moved from Harrison to Nela Park as associate manager of the Large Lamp Manufacturing Department . His co-manager was Martin L. Sloan , who had been in charge of the department since 1921 . In July , 1927 , Sloan joined W. H. Roberts in the Administration Department to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained the job he and Sloan had previously shared . Frank H. Blackburn , who had headed the Standardizing Department since 1915 , transferred to New York City in 1927 . The management of the Standardizing Department then passed to Carl T. Fuller , who had come to Nela Park in 1925 as associate manager . As these early transitions took place , W. R. Burrows and T. W. Frech worked together to supervise the consolidation process . Their joint leadership continued from 1925 to 1927 . Then Burrows proceeded to New York City as a General Electric vicepresident in charge of a special manufacturing activity . Frech continued as general manager of the Incandescent Lamp Depart-  | ment and in 1931 was also named as the General Electric vicepresident in charge . As chief administrator , Frech showed a conspicuous devotion to the Authority Reserved system of business organization ( see Chapter 1o ) . Throughout the period of his managership from 1921 to 1934 he maintained the structure and the spirit of this unique idea . To make it clear to others ? and perhaps especially for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserved system for the first time ? Frech wrote a book describing the organizational structure and the business principles represented in it . Dr. Zay Jeffries assisted in the preparation of this volume . It was a slim little book physically ? only 63 printed pages . It carried no authors ' names . The title page bore the inscription : " Printed but not published . Cleveland , Ohio , September , 1930 . " This meant that it was not for general distribution . Nowhere in its pages were the names of individuals used , nor the names of National or General Electric . The title was " Business Ideals , Principles , and Policies . " Yet , for all its unpretentiousness , the book served a useful purpose by summarizing the methods that Terry had developed and that Frech was continuing to practice . The consolidation of engineering , sales , and sales promotion developed more slowly than in manufacturing . The staffs in each of these fields were gradually fused into an efficient combination in the divisional offices throughout the country as well as at Nela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illuminating engineers to the various sales divisions . This had been started on an experimental basis as early as 1920 , when James M. Ketch of the Nela Park Engineering Department brought to customers in the South the ideas and methods developed in Cleveland . In 1923 Ketch became the engineer for the Michigan Division in Detroit . His work proved the value of closer contact between the consumer and the Engineering Department . A complete line-up of division engineers was established in succeeding years . Their work grew into one of the most fruitful activities of the Lamp Department .  | In 1930 Ward Harrison took over the management of the Engineering Department , succeeding S. E. Doane . This was another example of the " classes of 1909 to 1920 " progressing to leadership as the pioneers of lampmaking began to play less active parts . Harrison was admirably suited to the intensive demands of the new era in illuminating engineering . Completely objective , deeply sincere , he never failed to search for and find the essential truths of lighting principles , let the chips fall where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization in this field by encouraging young talent , so Harrison made his influence felt throughout the lighting industry by his own work and that of his associates . Then there was the Law Department . If any proof of the need for competent legal counsel had been lacking previously , the antitrust case of 1922 ? 1926 supplied it . At the same time , of course , the Law Department handled countless recurring problems that were important even though they had no direct bearing on court actions . Here also the Incandescent Lamp Department was fortunate in the caliber of the men on its staff . C. W. Appleton , manager from 1921 to 1926 , was followed by Howard C. Couse , a lawyer of great integrity and of calm , judicious temperament . Getting the millions of lamps to the right place at the right time was a big job and it was handled by the Transportation Department . Harvey N. Sibbald managed this activity until 1930 , supervising the service to customers in every corner of the nation . When W. George Davis was appointed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warehouse and Transportation . After two years Davis assumed the leadership of the newly organized Parts Manufacturing Department ( wire , glass , etc. ) and left the service functions in the able hands of M. J. Hamner . The tasks of sales management had enlarged tremendously . On the other hand , there was a wealth of sales talent in the sales offices of both National and Edison , so it was a difficult problem to assign divisional and headquarters responsibilities . The method adopted earlier in some departments , with an Edison man and a National man sharing a single managership , had not proved very successful . In Sales , however , a workable solution was reached  | in 1931 by dividing the nationwide operation into two parts . N. H. Boynton took charge of Western Sales , while Edwin E. Potter handled Eastern Sales . Boynton had led the Publicity Department ( advertising and sales promotion ) from 1912 to 1918 . He managed the Buckeye Division for eight years and then returned to Nela Park , in charge of sales promotion from 1927 to 1931 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York district managership from 1919 to 1924 and the position of assistant general sales manager at Harrison from 1924 to 1931 . Boynton and Potter led their sales staffs in different ways , each suiting his administration to his own personality . Yet together they created a unity and drive among General Electric lamp salesmen unmatched anywhere else in the industry . Consolidating the field sales staffs was of course a somewhat delicate job , and took about two years ? 1930 and 1931 . However , it was accomplished successfully by carefully considering individual positions and the previous abilities of both Edison and National sales-district organizations . The Sales Promotion Department assumed more importance , too , as sales volume and advertising budgets increased . New media such as radio were employed , along with an ever-growing use of newspapers and magazines . Between Boynton 's two turns at the helm , P. B. Zimmerman had been the manager ( 1918 ? 1927 ) for National . Then , in 1931 , H. Freeman Barnes came to Nela Park from Harrison to direct the department . Barnes had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three years later he transferred to the Publicity Department , which was headed by John W. McIver , and in 1928 became assistant manager . Known for his perpetual friendly smile and his flair for the dramatic in presenting the advantages of better lighting , Freeman Barnes soon made a prominent place for himself in bringing those benefits to the American people . Not long after his appointment he was joined by Robert P. Burrows as assistant manager . Burrows had served National in sales and management positions on the West Coast . He handled much of the departmental organizational job , so that the team of Barnes and Burrows came to be accepted like the team  | of Boynton and Potter and other such combinations in the Lamp Department . All told , by the end of 1931 the movement was complete and the combined organization was functioning well . The employee list had reached a total of more than 8,600 men and women . About 1,300 were at Nela Park ; the great majority were employed in the factories and offices from coast to coast . BOOSTING EFFICIENCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change to inside-frosted bulbs , for instance , and others that will be covered in Chapter 16 . It was also a time for making customer service better on other counts . A notable step in this direction was the simplified line of lamps , which was worked out in 1925 . The so-called " bread-and-butter " lamps accounted for a very high percentage of total volume . These were the household sizes in the standard line of lamps ? those used most often in homes . The Lamp Department settled on a single bulb shape for the simplified line and used it for six wattages : 15 , 25 , 40 , 50 , 6o , and loo watts . These replaced 45 different types and sizes formerly made as general-purpose bulbs . This change benefited everyone . Agents at all levels of distribution found their stock , storage , and display problems eased immeasurably . Warehousing costs and manufacturing costs were cut , and that helped to bring about lower selling prices . Consumers benefited from the price reductions and had an easier choice to make in buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packaging of lamps , using bulb wrappers ( sleeves ) that made handling and storage easier . Beginning in 1926 the G-E monogram and the wattage and voltage ratings were etched on the ends of the bulbs ; this system replaced the small paper stickers formerly used . An improved warehouse program accompanied the consolidation . From 1927 to 1929 larger and better warehouses were established in seven principal centers of demand . Over the next  | 20 years this phase of the business grew to embrace 18 district warehouses and 19 auxiliary warehouses devoted exclusively to lamps : a total of 700,000 square feet with a capacity of 150 million lamps . Agents and consumers got quicker , more satisfactory service . UNIFIED AND READY With a completely unified management , the Incandescent Lamp Department was now ready to meet the challenges of the difficult depression years to come . A new " A " license between General Electric and Westinghouse was concluded at a time when the earlier agreement was soon to expire . Westinghouse wished to continue the arrangement . The new license was effective Jan. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon until the following year . The license provisions were similar in general to those of the earlier agreement . Lamp production in General Electric plants improved steadily . Output of large lamps climbed to about 62 per man-hour in 1930 as compared to about 30 in 1925 . ( The figures refer to direct operating labor ? those employees actively engaged in lamp production . ) This doubling of productivity in five years was largely attributable to the amazing improvements in machines and methods , making the individual operator 's job easier rather than more demanding . The work of lampmaking , which had once been seasonal according to demand , had been spread out by the management to give practically year-round employment . Employees ' take-home pay increased as production volume and sales went up . The industry 's total production of large lamps in 1931 reached 319 million , compared to 273 million in 1925 . Miniature-lamp volume was down , however , reflecting the downward economic trend after 1929 in the automobile industry and other industries that comprised major customers for these lamps . The public shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its long-standing policy of reducing lamp prices as lower costs of manufacture and distribution made it possible .  | Together with higher efficiency in the product , the price decreases during the twenties effected good-sized reductions in the consumer 's cost of light . Price changes during this 10-year period are shown in the accompanying table . Table The announcement that two such groups as the Edison and National Lamp Works are to be joined together appears quite often in business news pages , but the reader seldom realizes the complexities of such a movement . After the six years of adjustment required in this case , General Electric still manufactured lamps identified as " Edison MAZDA " and " National MAZDA . " But now there was a single cohesive organization of men and women working toward the same objectives .  | Lamps for a Thousand Uses UNTIL THE LATE 1920 's the lamp industry placed prin emphasis on improvement of the basic source of ligl the standard lamp bulb . By that time the tungsten L had been modernized with tipless construction and inside ft ing . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , there were many different lighting applieat and General Electric manufactured many other types of lar It was a long list : All these were variants from the standard line . Each fulfi a special purpose for which engineering and manufacturing had to be worked out . Now a new development period began . Improvements in design and manufacture of the standard bulbs continued , bu addition the development specialists of the G-E Lamp Der ment moved into new fields and designed entirely new type  | lamps . The eyes of even the most restrained researchers gleamed with excitement as these novel ideas moved toward the production stage . Seldom in the history of lamp research were so many new types developed as during the period when William L. Enfield was manager and Harold D. Blake technical director of the Lamp Development Laboratory . Enfield followed John Randall as manager and carried on the administrative work particularly . He left the direction of the development work to Harold Blake , who played a prominent part in so many projects that none of them can be singled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together they formed a most effective team , guiding the laboratory 's group of research specialists through a series of great advances in creative development . First , of course , there were the improvements in standard lamps . Over the years from 1926 on , General Electric technicians made some 20 advances in the design of these " bread-and-butter " bulbs . Similarly , the machine experts patented improvements in lampmaking equipment . Every year the lamps grew stronger , more uniform , more efficient ? better for the consumer , easier to manufacture . The improvements are not listed here , nor the inventors ' names , because the details are too specialized for general interest . It would be foolish to say that General Electric laboratory men , engineers , salesmen , and administrators did not make mistakes or suffer setbacks as they developed and marketed their products . Of course they did . Nevertheless this was a time of exceptional progress . The G-E lamps in use today are superior products because the men and women throughout the organization kept in mind that the constant aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brighter Longer . " The story of improvements and new types that follows in this chapter specifies certain years when the developments occurred . These are usually the dates when the new products appeared on the market . The actual development work was done earlier , since it always takes considerable time to bring laboratory findings to the production line .  | Also , where individuals have been credited with these discoveries , they would be the first to point out the essential group character of the work . In almost all cases it takes more than one person to produce a refinement or a new product . THE COILED-COIL FILAMENT In addition to the improvements in standard lamps that boosted efficiency a little at a time ? adding r/to lumen per watt here and 2/io 1pw there ? one major design change resulted in a sizable increase . This was the coiled-coil filament . From the time of Langmuir 's work on gas-filled lamps the industry had known that coiling the filament made the lamps more efficient . The filament wire was coiled around mandrels as one of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benbow , manager of the Cleveland Wire Works ( a part of National ) , had obtained a patent on coiling the wire twice , to make what could be called a " coiled-coil " filament . Double coiling had been used for some projection-lamps . However , its application to the smaller filaments used in standard lamps presented numerous difficulties for years after Benbow obtained his patent . Double coiling required very precise tolerances . Each tiny coil had to be spaced perfectly so that current would not jump Figure  | from one coil to the next . There were problems in removing the mandrels or forms on which the wire was coiled . Experimental work went forward but it was not until the middle thirties that the Nela Park research workers and the Wire Works men could figure out completely practical methods for commercial production . Jonathan Force and John Flaws led this development work . Introduced by General Electric in 1936 , the coiled-coil filament accounted for a notable efficiency increase in standard lamps . The 6o-watt lamp , for which the best previous rating was 12.5 lumens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than 10 per cent . Output of the 1 oo-watt lamp increased from 15.3 1pw to 16. o , a gain of about 4% per cent . ROUGH-SERVICE LAMPS Most people think of lamp bulbs as being used in places where they sit firmly in their sockets and take relatively little abuse . But there are many other locations where lamps undergo severe punishment , where the tiny wires and glass parts take a beating from vibration and physical shock . A battleship needs light . So does a factory using heavy , high-speed machinery . The lamps are often mounted on the constantly vibrating machines . In thousands of locations it is handy to have a bulb on an extension cord , bringing the light to the work . The lamps in all such applications are subject to bumps or vibrations . Years of experiment to design lamps that would withstand such treatment culminated in 1928 with General Electric 's improved rough-service lamps . The filament wire was tightly coiled on very small mandrels . The relatively long coil was carefully mounted and held by many supports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 supports . ) Especially strong construction was used for the stem and other glass parts . Actually , two different types were developed ? rough-service and vibration-service lamps ? to fit special needs more closely . These types demonstrate the basic problem of all lampmaking ? the creation of products able to take rough treatment , while the various parts are by nature delicate and precise .  | PREFOCUS BASES Robert S. Burnap of the Edison Lamp Works originated a method of base construction and filament positioning that made it possible to provide much more accurate distribution and concentration of light for certain special purposes . The prefocus base permitted placement of the filament very precisely with respect to reflecting surfaces and lenses . For instance , in a home movie projector there is usually a reflector behind the projection lamp to throw the light forward and a condensing lens in front of the lamp to concentrate the light on the screen . Burnap 's design provided more effective filament positioning so that such reflectors and lenses could operate to best advantage . It was introduced in 1929 , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to automobile headlamps , beginning in 1933 . COPPER-TO-GLASS SEAL For many years the factor that determined how large a lamp could be made was the strength of the glass-and-metal joints in the neck of the bulb . A very large lamp required a heavy filament and supporting structure . The size and weight of this assembly was limited by the relatively weak joining of glass to metal at the bottom of the bulb . Daniel K. Wright of the Lamp Development Laboratory searched for a new method of combining an electrical conductor ( copper ) with an insulator ( glass ) . His efforts finally led to a completely new internal structure for large-sized lamps . Wright was one of the Edison Lamp Works experts who had transferred to Nela Park in 1927 . The ingenious construction Dan Wright worked out was called a " bi-post base . " Instead of mounting the filament on a glass support with the lead-in wires imbedded in the glass , he built up the internal structure from two heavy metal prongs ( bi-posts ) . The prongs served as the lamp 's base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prongs were mounted in a jig ; then a thick glass cup was sealed to them . A strong supporting structure , carrying the filament , was mounted on the prongs and the bulb was placed over the entire assembly and sealed to the glass cup . Figure First used in 1932 for large-sized motion-picture and airway lamps , bi-post construction was later employed for other applications , particularly automobile headlamps . Lamps could now be built to sizes of 10,000 , 30,000 , and even 5o,00o watts . The mogul bi-post construction for these giants was later modified in medium bi-post lamps introduced in 1936 . These included sizes from 500 watts to 1,500 watts inclusive . PHOTOFLASH AND PHOTOFLOOD LAMPS A new era in photography began in 1930 and 1931 when General Electric introduced photoflash lamps for the first time in the United States . The old cumbersome system of producing light for flash photography was to ignite flash powder on metal trays . It had always involved smoke , odor , and noise ; the amount of light could not be accurately controlled . Now the amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant flash of white light , timed to the split second and synchronized with the camera shutter . There was no muss , no fuss , and the used bulbs were easily disposable . Photoflash lamps have revolu-  | tionized the art of pictorial news gathering . And , as everyone knows , amateurs use them by the millions for additional pleasure in photography . General Electric purchased the American patent rights of the inventor of photoflash lamps , Johannes Ostermeier of Germany . The U.S. patent was issued in September , 1930 . Nela Park specialists developed the lamps further . These first photoflash bulbs contained small crumpled squares of ultrathin aluminum foil and a quantity of oxygen . The filament was coated with a zirconium powder " primer " that ignited the aluminum foil when the switch was closed . Here were lamps with a burning life of only a few hundredths of a second , as compared to rated lives of 750 or 1,000 hours for most of the standard lamps . To study their flash characteristics a new technique of photometric measurement had to be devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been developed by Gwilym F. Prideaux of the Nela Park Engineering Department . Photoflood bulbs produced high light intensities over a short life-3 , 6 , or 10 hours , according to size and type . They made possible much better picture-taking for both amateurs and professionals . 3-WATT ETCHED-FILAMENT LAMPS About the same time that General Electric was building huge lamps ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 watts , an interesting new bulb appeared at the opposite end of the scale . It was a tiny lamp designed for use in clock dials , wall switches , and call signals in hospitals and hotels . The filament wire was so thin as to be invisible to the naked eye . To produce wire that fine , tungsten had to be drawn through some 90 dies , many of them diamond dies . A small slug of tungsten less than % inch in diameter , when drawn in this manner , made a strand of wire 207 miles long ? enough to supply filaments for more than 65,000 of these 3-watt lamps . The last diamond die drew the wire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed in an acid that ate away part  | of the metal until the diameter decreased another i/o , 000 inch . Finally it was washed , coiled , and cut into proper lengths for filaments . These midget lamps , introduced in 1931 , gave long-life service in 24-hour-per-day usage ? another example of the unusual applications that called for resourceful design and manufacture . FUSE WIRES IN LAMPS Irving H. Van Horn of the Lamp Development Laboratory developed and perfected the use of fuse-wire construction in G-E lamps . One of the two lead-in wires was constructed to act as a fuse . It was thinner than the other wire . When the lamp burned out , the fuse wire opened the circuit automatically . This was an important safety measure , making violent failures of lamps almost impossible . THREE-LIGHT LAMPS One of the most useful types of lamps ever developed came on the market in 1933 ? the three-light lamp . These bulbs contained two filaments . One , for instance , might be a too-watt filament and the other designed to operate on 200 watts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb could be turned to a lower level of light by using the 1 oo-watt filament , to a medium level by using the zoo-watt filament , and to a higher level by employing both filaments for a total of 300 watts . Bulbs containing two filaments were not a new idea . Some had been manufactured many years before . But no one made them for general lighting service until General Electric figured out good applications for them in the early and middle 1930 's . As a result , floor lamps , table lamps , and lighting fixtures were designed to utilize three-light bulbs . They brought added convenience , decorative beauty , and new ease of seeing to millions of American homes . These bulbs provided real flexibility in residential lighting , and manufacturers of portable lamps used them for literally millions of products in the next 20 years .  | MECHANICAL BASES Stronger and better bases were needed for high-wattage floodlights and lamps used for street lighting . The same was true for some applications of general-service lamps . Severe operating conditions often subjected lamps to wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to seal the base to the bulb was affected . Weakening of the basing cement sometimes caused the failure of otherwise satisfactory lamps . Experts of the Lamp Development Laboratory and the Cleveland Equipment Works created a new type of base called the " mechanical base . " Introduced in 1933 , the mechanical base did not use cement but , as the name implies , joined the bulb and the base in a structural conformation . The neck of the bulb was molded with four indentations or recesses . Then an inner brass shell , made with screw threads , was placed on the neck of the bulb . This brass collar had four lugs corresponding to the recesses in the glass , so that it snapped snugly into place . A regular large-sized ( mogul ) brass screw base was fitted to the inner shell . The result was a tight joint , with the necessary lead wires welded into proper contact . The lamps could stand up to great variations in temperature ? freezing cold or the heat of long hours of service . BETTER MEASURING INSTRUMENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to design improved measuring instruments ? to check on the light output and general performance of all types of lamps , to measure illumination levels in any location , and to determine lighting needs in every conceivable application . It would be impossible to enumerate here all the devices built for these purposes . Only a few examples can be cited . As one illustration , Dr. William E. Forsyth designed a very large and useful spectroscope . The instrument he constructed broke up a light beam into a spectrum ; that , of course , is the major function of any spectroscope . But the Forsyth instrument also  | made it possible to select a single wavelength and to measure the power of the individual wavelength . At about the same time ? 1933 ? a group in the Engineering Department developed a pocket-sized light meter . This brought to the highest degree of convenience the industry trend toward small portable meters for measuring illumination levels on the job . It was not easy . Building a high degree of accuracy , stability , and sturdiness into a small instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $loo is feasible . To accomplish similar results at a price of $11.5o was a tough job . But it was done , and the small G-E light meter , like those produced by other manufacturers , became an immensely useful tool for the lighting engineer . The visibility meter , an instrument for appraising the relative visibility of various " seeing tasks , " was made available in 1935 . This meter was developed by Dr. Matthew Luckiesh and Frank K. Moss of the Lighting Research Laboratory . Where the light meter measured lighting levels , the visibility meter indicated lighting needs . An engineer could use it to determine many of the seeing problems of a typist , an industrial machine operator , or any other worker . It could measure the visibility of a store display , for example , or a traffic sign , so that better lighting could be prescribed . IMPROVED PROJECTION LAMPS A new line of projection lamps ( for projecting movies or still pictures ) appeared in 1933 . They employed intricate , highly concentrated filaments , with several coils used together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It presented almost a solid rectangle of light , which provided much higher screen brightnesses ? about double the levels attained before . Less bulb blackening permitted higher brightness to be maintained through the life of the lamp . Higher wattage in a bulb of a given physical size was possible , as compared to previous projection lamps .  | LUMILINE LAMPS In 1934 General Electric placed the lumiline lamp on the market . It was a tubular incandescent-light source with electrical contacts at each end . A long filament ran through the lamp , resting on a series of supports and providing a practically continuous line of light . These lamps were 1 inch in diameter and were manufactured in three wattages . The 15-watt and 3o-watt lamps were 18 inches long ; the 4o-watt lamp was 12 inches long . Later a 6o-watt 18-inch lamp was supplied . While lumiline lamps filled some utilitarian needs , they were especially well adapted to decorative lighting . G.E . made them available in clear glass , white inside-frosted glass , and a number of color coatings . They found uses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coves , coffers , and showcases . Most of the development work on these lamps was accomplished by Paul O. Cartun of the Lamp Development Laboratory . LENS-END FLASHLIGHT BULBS Improvements in miniature lamps kept pace with the betterment of large lamps . For instance , there was the application of lensend bulbs to the flashlight field . Bulbs with small built-in lenses had formerly been used only in such medical instruments as the bronchoscope , where they materially aided the work of physicians and surgeons . The diminutive bulbs for these purposes cost about a dollar each ; they were especially made by hand . Then Walter J. Geiger and Alfred T. Gaskill of the Lamp Development Laboratory developed a machine that would form these bulbs automatically . The cost per lamp dropped sharply , so that they could be sold for about io cents . This design achievement spurred the production of a single-cell flashlight only about 3 inches long and % inch in diameter . Soon afterward a similar two-cell light came along , known as the " fountain-pen " flashlight . The lens-end miniature lamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many other small devices .  | MULTIPLE CHRISTMAS-TREE LAMPS The year 1934 saw a further real advance in small bulbs when General Electric made multiple Christmas-tree lamps available . Bulbs for the family Yule tree had formerly been made for operation in series only . When one lamp on a " string " burned out , they all went off until the burned-out bulb had been located and replaced . The new lamps operated on the multiple or parallel system , so that only the burned-out bulb ceased to operate . It could be spotted quickly and readily replaced . GLASS MACHINERY IMPROVEMENTS As stated earlier , by 1934 General Electric had in operation its first ribbon machine for bulbmaking . This installation was at the Pitney Glass Works in Cleveland . Within four years G-E technicians in glass machinery development increased the capacity of this type of machine from about 350,000 bulbs per 24 hours to about 900,000 . Later they pushed this figure even higher ? to about 1,250,000 bulbs every 24 hours . These gains came through successive improvements , through keeping everlastingly at the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was still used for much of the bulb output , was also further improved . SILVERED-BOWL LAMPS Silvered-bowl lamps joined the industry 's parade of new types in the middle thirties . These were standard bulbs with a silver coating on the outside of the bowl ( the lower part of the bulb ) . Other metallic coatings were also applied to " seal in " the silver finish . The Silvray Company pioneered ' the development of these lamps . The bowl coating shielded the bright filament from view and at the same time formed an efficient reflector , throwing light upward for indirect illumination . Used in homes , schools , offices , and stores , silvered-bowl lamps  | filled a multitude of needs . Made in a wide range of sizes from 6o to 1,000 watts inclusive , they furnished a new reflector with each lamp replacement . This reduced the maintenance problems caused by the collection of dust and dirt on reflecting surfaces . NEW REFLECTOR-LAMP DESIGNS Another line of lamps with a built-in reflecting surface solved several lighting problems very satisfactorily . Known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to concentrate the light as needed for spotlighting or floodlighting . An inside coating of vaporized aluminum , developed by Royal Strickland of G.E. , was their most distinctive feature ; it provided a highly efficient reflecting surface . The filament could be positioned for accurate control of the light , and the degree of frosting on the inside front surface of the glass helped to make the distribution pattern a " spot " or a " flood , " as desired . These R-bulb lamps served admirably for display lighting in stores , for many industrial applications , and for illumination of yards , gardens , and driveways . General Electric first listed them in 1936 in 150-watt and Soo-watt sizes , with a 5-inch diameter . Later other sizes were added to the line . ADVANCING BEYOND THE CARBON ARC During this period General Electric also took rapid strides in developing lamps other than incandescent bulbs . The old carbon-arc lamp was surpassed as a general lighting source by the incandescent bulb . However , other useful lamps had been created from time to time that were essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has concentrated on the incandescent developments . Now it is in order to review briefly some of the early arc lamps that differed from the carbon arc . In the 189o 's an inventor named D. M. Moore created light sources that were tubes many feet long and about 2 inches in diameter . The application of very high voltage ( as high as 16,000 volts ) caused an arc to strike through the long glass tube between  | the electrodes placed at each end . The tube was filled with gas . Nitrogen was used for some types of Moore tubes , carbon dioxide or ordinary air at very low pressures for others . Moore , a G-E employee , left the company in 1894 and organized his own firm . The efficiency of the tubes was high and he found ways to obtain satisfactory lamp life . However , there were many handicaps of cost , complicated installation , high voltage , and difficult operation . The advent of tungsten-filament lamps caused Moore 's business to decline . He sold it to General Electric in 1912 and resumed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE COOPER-HEWITT LAMP Meantime another electric-discharge lamp appeared . It was the mercury-vapor arc lamp introduced in 1901 by Peter Cooper Hewitt . Known as the Cooper-Hewitt lamp , it was the product of experiments the inventor made in Newark , N.J. , following up the earlier work of nineteenth-century European researchers . The Cooper-Hewitt lamp , 4 feet long , contained a small amount of mercury which was partially vaporized when electric current was applied to the electrodes at each end of the tube . Gradually an arc struck through the length of the tube and the result was production of a greenish-blue light . Efficiency was high as compared to other light sources of that time ? about 12.5 lumens per watt . Lamp life , about 2,000 hours , was very satisfactory . Because of the color quality of the light , however , the lamp was not suitable for general commercial use . Its most extensive application over the years was in industry , photography , and similar fields where the lack of red color components in the light was not especially important . Besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were less widely used . The Cooper-Hewitt Electric Co. , formed in 1902 with the financial support of George Westinghouse , promised to capture a good-sized slice of the lighting market . In time it did so , but its early years were marked by patent conflicts .  | In the G-E Research Laboratory at Schenectady , Dr. Ezekiel Weintraub had invented a mercury-arc rectifier which converted alternating current to direct current . His colleague , Charles P. Steinmetz , designed a mercury-arc lamp that operated in conjunction with Weintraub 's rectifier . The patent application for the General Electric rectifier came into conflict with a patent held by Hewitt for the same type of device . The question of priority remained unsettled . For several years both companies were handicapped by this uncertainty . Finally , in 1913 , an agreement involving the exchange of patent licenses permitted both to manufacture mercury-arc rectifiers and lamps freely . Then in 1919 General Electric purchased the Cooper-Hewitt company . It later became known as the General Electric Vapor Lamp Co. , a G-E subsidiary . During the period 1919-1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Vapor Lamp Co. grew to be an influential factor , especially in industrial lighting . Its technical experts , engineers , and salesmen contributed much to the building of a better-lighted America . Several other types of lamps operate on the same basic principle as the old Cooper-Hewitt lamp . A current will pass between electrodes sealed into a glass envelope , that contains vapors or inert gases . Such a lamp may be called an " arc lamp " in the broad sense of the term . The action by which the current flows through the lamp and results in the production of light is called gaseous conduction . All arc lamps require separate auxiliary equipment for satisfactory starting and consistent operation . The starting equipment aids in causing the arc to strike . The ballast governs the flow of current to assure normal , satisfactory operation . THE S-i SUNLAMP One of the first fruits of General Electric work in electricdischarge lamps during the 1920 's was not primarily a light source . It was the S-1 sunlamp . This was the first " lamp bulb " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  | skin . Earlier sunlamps had not resembled conventional lamp bulbs in appearance . The S-1 lamp was a mercury-vapor type , producing both ultraviolet radiation and some visible light . A special glass bulb was used to screen out harmful rays . G.E . introduced it in 1929 . SODIUM-VAPOR LAMPS For several years scientists in the Schenectady laboratory experimented with sodium vapor as the filling for electric-discharge lamps . They produced lamps that operated with an efficiency three to four times that of filament bulbs . However , the high efficiency could be maintained for only a few hours . The hot sodium vapor attacked any glass then available and blackened the bulbs very rapidly . Finally , developments in glass technology produced a glass that would resist the effects of the heated sodium vapor . Lamps using this gaseous filling soon appeared in both Europe and the United States . From 1933 on General Electric made these lamps available . Producing a yellowish light , they were truly highefficiency lamps ( 45 to 55 lumens per watt ) . They were ( and are ) used primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Electric began the manufacture of an important line of light sources for industry ? high-intensity mercury lamps . They were produced by the Vapor Lamp Co. and marketed by the Lamp Department . First made in the 400-watt size , these Type H lamps did such an effective job that other sizes soon were made to fill out the line : loo , 250 , and 3,000 watts . They could be used alone or combined with incandescent bulbs to provide more of a white color than could be obtained with the bluish mercury color alone . These were intricate examples of lampmaking skill . An inner arc tube of quartz contained the electrodes ( made of coiled tung-  | sten wire ) and several other small but important parts . A small amount of pure argon gas ( to facilitate starting ) and a minute , carefully measured amount of mercury provided the gas components . The mercury was vaporized by the heat resulting from the striking of the arc through the argon . The quartz arc tube was surrounded by an elongated glass bulb . The first 400-watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . Its diameter was 2 inches . More recently a shorter version has been manufactured , i i inches long and slightly larger in diameter through most of its length . COMBINED OPERATIONS New types of lamps poured into the market , as the foregoing record shows . But important as the development work was , it served only as the starting point in a long series of demanding tasks in the General Electric Lamp Department . In manufacturing there were literally hundreds of operating changes to be handled . Workers in the Equipment Works made contributions . So did those in the Base Works , the other parts plants , the glass factories , and in lamp-assembly operations . The Engineering group worked out the best applications for the new products . Sales Promotion ? Sales ? Service ? Accounting ? all divisions helped to provide the connecting links between the laboratories and the consuming public . A divisional sales manager in the South summed it up this way : " New products in the early thirties gave us more opportunities to help our customers than we 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great business depression . " Better lighting . . . better lamps . . . we 've talked about them for years , until sometimes we feel like leaving the word better ' out of our vocabularies entirely . But the customers did n't grow tired of hearing about more benefits for their homes or businesses . Furthermore , we can prove that our new products are better than what we were able to provide before ? by actual measurement in most cases . We do n't have to call a new lamp a  | Super-Dynamic Ultra-Something-or-Other and trust that the fancy name will make it sound terrific . " Anyway , at that time particularly ? 1930 ? 1935 ? the public wanted more guidance . People wanted to know more about how to recognize their lighting needs . They welcomed good suggestions on how to fill those needs . And that 's just what General Electric began to provide when it was wanted most . . . . "  | The Science of Seeing F V49VERYONE WHO EXPERIENCED the world-wide business depression that began in 1929 remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For several years the American economy struggled through a period of drastic deflation , with ravaging unemployment and sharp declines in production and national income . The lamp industry was of course subject to the same forces of depression as all other business . Yet it weathered the economic hurricane with less severe ill effects than most industries . The sales record indicates the stability of the business even in the face of the economic crisis . Table Sales of miniature lamps and special types declined more than large lamps did during 1929-1933 . But the public acceptance of the major products ? now more than ever the " bread-and-butter " lamps ? sustained the General Electric lamp business and kept employment at a relatively high level . ' Phis was due in great measure to the sweat and spirit of the salesmen in every sales territory . They met the tough times with 167  | fortitude , persistence , and plain hard work . They sold G-E lamps when the salesmen in most lines , from locomotives to jelly beans , maintained that no one could or would buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical industry during the disheartening depression days . The employees in the Lamp Department factories naturally benefited , with a job security almost unmatched in American industry . General Electric lamp agents at the wholesale and retail levels found that their lamp business was a mainstay on which they could depend when other sales were slumping . The Lamp Department 's energetic promotional work was advantageous to lighting-equipment manufacturers and to electric-light-and-power companies . MANAGEMENT CHANGES T. W. Frech retired as vice-president and general manager of the Lamp Department in 1934 . His successor was Joseph E. Kewley . During Frech 's leadership the successful consolidation of National and Edison had been effected . He had guided the organization through several years of rapid expansion , and it had met and overcome the most pressing difficulties of the depression . While Frech officially retired , his love for dealing with various problems in the lamp business persisted , along with his quiet friendliness toward all his coworkers . So he continued to appear regularly during the working week at Nela Park for some time ? not interfering with the management he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . J. E. Kewley had entered the company as a young lawyer in November , 1910 , specializing in credit problems at first . He managed the Law Department at Nela Park for a little more than a year after World War I and in 1920 moved into the Administration Division as a top assistant to Frech . From 1925 to 1931 he headed all sales activity for National . A tall friendly man with a ready smile , he might best be described as rugged in both appearance and personality . Always a superior administrator , Kewlcy possessed an exceptional ability to help people compromise their differences beneficially in matters of policy and management .  | During the decade 1930 ? 1940 there were a number of retirements in the factories and the sales districts , with another welltrained generation of lamp men taking over management . New plants and district offices provided advancement for others . At Nela Park there were relatively few changes in divisional management . M. J. Hamner continued to direct the General Service Division until 1936 . Then he took up other administrative duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lamp Development Laboratory . Following Carl Fuller as manager of the Standardizing Division was Raymond B. Walling , who served in that capacity during a busy 10 years from 1937 on . In the Lamp Manufacturing Division , William J. Whiteside followed Frank Patterson . Whiteside began his managership in 1932 . That was the year in which a new division ? Parts Manufacturing ? was organized . Headed by W. George Davis , this group served all the factories making lamp parts , including ( until 1941 ) the glass plants . A new star in the management firmament emerged in 1934 when Philip D. Reed was appointed as manager of the Law Division , where he had first begun work with the company in 1926 . This dynamic young lawyer made such an impression on top General Electric management that he soon found himself playing a primary role in the over-all direction of the company . He was in charge of the Law Department for four ' years , then went on to assume further management responsibilities ; and on Jan. 1 , 1940 , he was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard C. Couse was again named as the manager of the Law Division . STUDYING THE PROCESS OF SEEING Making and selling lamps was an interesting business . But what made it most engrossing was the fact that it involved studying lighting needs and problems ? and that , in turn , required some understanding of seeing . For people buy lamps in order to get light , and they want light so that they can see .  | However , this basic chain had not been very thoroughly understood or studied . It was so simple , when stated in its bare essentials , that most people ? even those in the lighting industry ? took it for granted . They had made great progress in the lighting art , but they found complications in obtaining satisfactory lighting for good seeing ? psychological , physical , and engineering complications . Quite often lighting men became entangled in details ( lumens , lamberts , cut-off angles , reflection factors , coefficients of utilization ) . These details were often quite important , but they were the trees . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry began to take a good over-all look at the forest . Workers in the Lighting Research Laboratory at Nela Park reviewed the earlier studies of the subject and then took a different approach to the problems of seeing . They thoroughly explored the relationships between light and sight . This exhaustive research work was carried on under the direction of Dr. Matthew Luckiesh and Frank K. Moss . ( The Lighting Research Laboratory was not the same as the Lamp Development Laboratory . One was concerned with the problems of people 's lighting needs and possible solutions at the points where those needs existed ; the other was concerned with improving existing lamps and developing new ones . There is always a meeting ground between these two types of research ; they complement and help each other ; but their day-by-day investigations are in rather different fields . ) How did various quantities of light affect the process of seeing ? What were the effects of varying quality of lighting ? How did human beings really see ? was it by using the eyes and closely related bodily apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and affected ? These were some of the questions the Lighting Research Laboratory investigators asked themselves . Then they devised tests to determine the answers . Before drawing any conclusions they repeated each test time after time , using many people as subjects . In other words , their research was carried to points where its statistical validity could be firmly established . For a good many years the Illuminating Engineering Society  | had specified recommended lighting levels for various " seeing tasks " and various locations . These recommendations were made in terms of foot-candles . ( A foot-candle is the measuring unit for lighting levels , just as the degree is the measuring unit for heat ; the light meter is calibrated in foot-candles . ) The Science of Seeing research now gave a more accurate and extensive basis for revised foot-candle recommendations . RESEARCH FINDINGS In many of the tests , reading was used as a seeing task . Books printed in normal reading type ( Io-point and 12-point sizes ) were read by many individuals under 1 , to , and loo foot-candles . Actually , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little illumination ? less than 1 foot-candle ? but this was very difficult and tiring over any considerable length of time . Also , no person could judge accurately for himself the relative difficulty or ease of seeing at various lighting levels . So Luckiesh and Moss and their assistants developed intricate apparatus to record mechanically or electrically such factors as nervous muscular tension and eye-muscle fatigue during the carefully controlled tests . Here are some of the research findings , and some of the principles established in the Science of Seeing : 1 . Visual acuity ( sharpness of vision , tar basic ability to see ) increased about 30 per cent under to foot-candles of light as compared to 1 foot-candle . It increased about 70 per cent under too foot-candles as compared to 1 foot-candle. 2 . Eye-muscle fatigue was much less when people read under too foot-candles than it was under 1 foot-candle . Certain eye muscles tired three times as much under the low level of illumination as under the high level . 3 . Nervous muscular tension ? a tension affecting the entire body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination level was raised . 4 . It had long been known , of course , that the eyes , the optic nervous system , and the brain are all used in seeing . The new  | research now indicated that the entire nervous system and muscular system is affected , that people are " human seeing machines . " 5 . Man has naturally grown accustomed over the centuries to the seeing conditions existing outdoors in nature . Now , however , people perform many demanding visual tasks indoors under low levels of lighting . This is much more difficult " seeing work " than occurs outdoors , where there are hundreds and even thousands of foot-candles of light from the sun . 6 . As a result , eyesight defects have become common . They are not necessarily attributable to poor lighting , but certainly we are asking our eyes to do more difficult work than they did a few hundred years ago , before man moved indoors . The eye specialist can prescribe glasses , and they are very effective aids to seeing . But in addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and better electric lighting . 7 . Glare sharply reduces the ability to see . Therefore it is important to eliminate all forms of direct or reflected glare in order to obtain comfort and greater ability to see . 8 . The same is true of heavy shadows and harsh contrasts . So it is essential not only to provide the quantities of light recommended for easy seeing , but to be sure also that the quality of lighting is right . Lighting quality is improved by such steps as the shading or shielding of light sources ; avoidance of dark surroundings in contrast to bright spots of light on the work ; good placement and control of the light from lamps and fixtures . 9 . Factors that affect seeing include size ? the size of the object or the work to be seen ; brightness ; contrast ; and time  --  the length of time allowed for seeing or the time during which an individual is engaged in seeing tasks . All of these factors can be changed somewhat on occasion , so that better seeing will result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor most readily controlled , is brightness . For instance , the evening newspaper is printed with a size of type and on a kind of paper which do not make for easy reading . The chances of persuading the publishers to use 12-point type , and " slick " paper instead of newsprint , are rather slim ; the costs would be prohibitive . But reading the paper can be made much less difficult if the lighting is increased to  | recommended levels , with light that is free of glare , shadows , and harsh contrasts . lo . With the lighting industry well equipped to provide good illumination , there is no longer any reason to be handicapped by " barely seeing " when seeing can be made so much easier ? in the home , the factory , the school , the store , and the office . There was more ? much more ? to the research and information gathered together and called " the Science of Seeing . " The Lighting Research Laboratory studies continued . But , as indicated by some of the foregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filling lighting needs . The Lamp Department now had the tools to do a better job of analysis and improvement . The new types of lamps played their parts as well . The Science of Seeing opened wider fields for lighting engineers and salesmen . One could have the finest lamps to sell ? and the best reasons in the world for selling them ? but unless the facts could be brought to the public dramatically and thoroughly , there would still be apathy toward the problems of improving illumination . There would still be inadequate lighting in most locations . The United States needed a lighting education ? and the G-E Lamp Department took on that part of the job , too , along with the rest of the lighting industry .  | The Lighting Education of a Nation THE SCIENCE OF SEEING provided a core of sound ideas . Using that central fund of reasons for better lighting , the Lamp Department expanded its activities in every direction . There was a great ferment of lighting education and sales promotion . To those engaged in it there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before experienced in the lighting industry . One of the personalities typifying this surge of enthusiasm was Freeman Barnes , manager of the Sales Promotion Division . Barnes could make an exceptionally warm , appealing presentation of Science of Seeing ideas on the platform before any group . Besides his sense of drama and timing , he had a sincere belief in helping people benefit through better seeing . So he led the movement that took to the industry and the public the concepts Dr. Luckiesh and his colleagues had worked out . Barnes toured the country speaking on the subject ; he talked to groups assembled in the Lighting Institute at Nela Park ; and he made his presentation into short , effective motion pictures that were widely distributed . It is doubtful that any information program anywhere in industry has had a more effective , attention-compelling team of advocates than Barnes and Luckiesh as they operated from 1933 to 1941 . And they were joined early in this program by a lively group of associates , not only at Nela Park but also in every Lamp Department territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lighting Institute was revitalized and enlarged with new displays , demonstrations , and meeting programs . Here was an attractive building with 22,000 square feet of floor space devoted to education in lighting . Its reputation as the center of such information became world-wide . Lighting experts from Europe , Asia , and South America came to learn more about their specialty . As for Americans , they came by the thousands every year ? representatives of lighting-equipment manufacturers , of electric-light-and-power companies , of electrical wholesalers and retailers , plus other thousands from the general public . All were eager to get the latest ideas in lighting for homes , schools , stores , offices , and factories . It was all in the day 's work for L. C. Kent and his assistants to take care of several diverse groups of visitors , who might range from high-school students to engineers , architects , and designers specializing in highly complex problems . Each group found a full program scheduled . People from various sections at Nela Park gave demonstrations and talks of major interest to the particular audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the job for many members of the staff . The walls of the Institute were lined with exhibits : demonstrations of Science of Seeing ideas ; many types of G-E lamps ; the history of lamps and lighting ; and recommended installations of modern lighting . Besides a good-sized auditorium with a wellequipped stage , the building contained demonstration rooms where groups could meet to discuss the primary fields of lighting . Even so , the men and women exploring the new approach to lighting were dissatisfied . They were more than happy with the job the Institute was doing , but , in addition to the thousands they were reaching in that way , they wanted to bring the Science of Seeing to an ever-widening circle of millions . They put together several " traveling Institutes . " Each one employed a team of Nela Park people and a truckload of demonstration materials . During 1934 these troupes were on the road  | for several months , bringing to hundreds of community meetings as much of the Institute as possible . Many of the younger generation of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during these tours . This type of traveling demonstration had been used before by the Lamp Department , and has been employed since . It was not unique in American industry . But those who participated in the 1934 program still tell tales of the missionary zeal that sparked them , and agree that it marked a high point in their business lives . The story they had to tell involved the conservation of that most precious possession ? eyesight . It came as close to true public education as any business message could . There are many Americans today , of course , who have never heard of the Science of Seeing as such . But they have been exposed to parts of it in General Electric lamp advertising , in films , in meetings , in ordinary conversations . Their seeing is easier , their lives are richer , even though they may care nothing about the meaning of foot-candles or quality of lighting . No one should be expected to give three cheers for General Electric just because his lighting has improved and because his children have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigners for the Science of Seeing from 1933 on are satisfied that they have made contributions to American life even after the motive of selling more G-E lamps has been discounted . HOME-LIGHTING ACTIVITY By the standards established in the early thirties , most American homes were still miserably lighted . Dad fell asleep over the evening newspaper not only because he had done a day 's work but also because the dim light made his eyes tired . Mother found it impossible to get enough light for sewing . The youngsters complained about their homework . Having to study algebra and Latin was bad enough , they thought , but trying to do it in glare and shadows ? that made life very difficult . This was not news to the home-lighting experts at Nela Park .  | They had worked on these problems before . Now , however , they had the means to achieve better residential lighting . First , they carried on experimental work in the territories of several electric-light-and-power companies . They developed a pattern for presenting the information to the public and for training home-lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following the successful results in these test areas , the same segments of the lighting industry all over the country were encouraged to do a similar job . Staffs of home-lighting advisors and supervisors were trained and put to work . Most of them were young women , but several utility companies employed staffs of men for this program . During the middle and late thirties the total number of home-lighting advisors reached more than 2,500 . They made calls on homes throughout their territories . This was a service maintained largely by the utility companies , with no obligation for their customers to buy anything . An advisor surveyed the lighting in the home . She pointed out simple changes that could be made at little or no cost to improve existing lamps and fixtures . She carried a demonstration kit packed with interesting gadgets illustrating Science of Seeing facts and showing the advantages of good illumination . Finally , she filled out a complete recommendation form indicating the lighting changes that would be beneficial in various rooms . The householder could tell what lamp bulbs , portable lamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , the home-lighting advisors and supervisors gave talks and demonstrations to groups such as women 's clubs and Parent-Teacher Associations . They worked with department-store lamp buyers and with electrical retailers and wholesalers to get the best residential-lighting equipment in stock . They talked with architects and builders to aid in the specification of better wiring and lighting in new or remodeled homes . The Illuminating Engineering Society set up design specifications for portable lamps ( floor and table lamps ) that would do a superior lighting job . These were known as I.E.S. lamps and were made by many manufacturers . So long as a manufacturer con-  | structed lamps that conformed to the I.E.S. design requirements , he could place an I.E.S. tag on each such lamp . This tag was the mark of a portable lamp designed for better lighting results ; it guided consumers in making beneficial purchases of equipment . Many of these portables used three-light bulbs to provide flexible levels of illumination , and they contained glass diffusing bowls that softened and spread the light properly . The improvements in American homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Millions of I.E.S. lamps were sold . More millions of fixtures and existing lamps were modernized and fitted with the right-sized bulbs . New fixtures blossomed where the old ones were inadequate . People learned to appreciate the decorative beauty that light could add to their homes . They enjoyed more convenience and easier seeing in every home task or recreation . Eugene W. Commery led this program as head of the residential-lighting section of the Engineering Division . As he applied the research knowledge and engineering data to home-lighting situations , Commery showed the rare trait of always seeing not only the immediate need but the other needs that would soon arise . In this sense , good lighting can be called evolutionary : one improvement begets others . Commery 's able associates in this work became known from coast to coast as authorities on almost every lighting problem in the home . Prominent among them were Mary E. Webber and Helen McKinlay at Nela Park , and Lillian Eddy working in and around New York City . Today Commery and his staff regard the 1933 ? 1935 period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting practice they developed then ; methods and equipment have improved steadily in the intervening years . Yet the ground-breaking was stimulating because there was so much to be done and so many changes were vitally needed in the average home . COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LIGHTING As in residential lighting , leaders at Nela Park and in the field applied Science of Seeing ideas to the other major provinces of  | illumination ? store , office , school , and factory . The training of competent engineers and salesmen was a feature in this program also . A small army of enthusiastic workers for better lighting assembled in training schools at the Institute and at outdoor camps during the summer on the spacious grounds of Nela Park . Besides Lamp Department men , they included electrical contractors and dealers , wholesalers , and representatives of the utilities and the lighting-equipment manufacturers . Also , as it had done in home lighting , General Electric sponsored a detailed , written training program . This was published by the Corporation Service Division of LaSalle Extension University , after being prepared jointly by LaSalle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed the G-E ? LaSalle training programs . Lamp Department engineers worked through the Illuminating Engineering Society to advance the knowledge of the lighting art and to improve its practice . Their advice was frequently sought by such organizations as the Edison Electric Institute , the association of major electric-light-and-power companies . The I.E.S. , in conjunction with the American Standards Association , brought out detailed standards for school , office , and industrial lighting . These studies represented the best thinking and research of the entire profession , those working for other companies as well as General Electric , and those in the colleges . In the store field , lighting began not only to match other advances in merchandising but to open new ways to good business for large and small stores alike . The engineers made tests on the " stopping power " and selling power of window displays and interior displays . James M. Ketch of the Nela Park Engineering Division evolved a new idea to emphasize the need for better window lighting and the values it could provide . This he called " Three-second Selling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average passer-by for only three seconds . During that fleeting time it must make a selling impression ; it takes superior illumination , daytime or night , to capture attention and provoke buying interest . Later , Ketch worked out the Three A 's of good store illumination ? lighting for attraction , for ap-  | praisal of merchandise , and for an effective selling atmosphere . These were implemented by a long series of specific designs and recommendations for every merchandising purpose , worked out by a dozen or more Lamp Department engineers . Other , more specialized fields were not neglected . Architectural lighting , automotive , street and highway , street railway , and bus lighting , various types of offices and schoolrooms , railroads , aviation , lighting for photography in every form  --  all these and others received attention . The illumination in the average factory ? from textiles to toothbrushes , from food-packing plants to foundries ? was below par . The industrial-lighting men attacked the problem on all fronts . Nela Park issued a wide assortment of useful engineering bulletins , usually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field concerned . To name the entire roster of Lamp Department engineers who shared in this great extension of commercial and industrial lighting would be rather boring even if it were possible to be allinclusive . Many examples could be dredged up from memory of a remarkable list of achievements . Always there was Ward Harrison ? leading , counseling , acting as guide and mentor in the Authority Reserved tradition . As chief lieutenants to Harrison during this period one remembers Willard C. Brown and Herbert H. Magdsick , among others . It is perhaps enough to say that the Lamp Department engineer , whether one finds him at Nela Park or in Oscaloosa , is almost always a singularly self-effacing individual . A reporter for the trade press , trying to pry out a statement regarding a certain accomplishment , has a tough time getting " personality " into his story . " Now how about this job where you got 6o foot-candles on the work and cut down spoilage 28 per cent ? how did you get rid of those machine shadows that had always prevented really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that was n't too much trouble . Actually , Bob Harris , the fixture salesman , figured out the proper spacings . I gave him a little help but he did the real work . And we  | had a good contractor . That 's half the battle . Be sure to give this fellow Simonson credit when you write it up . " LIGHT MAGAZINE As mentioned before , since 1923 the Lamp Department had been blessed with an excellent means of distributing information , Light Magazine . It had grown more and more influential since the day when T. W. Frech launched it , with Roscoe E. Scott as managing editor and Dr. Charles A. Eaton as editor in chief . The publication described itself as " a magazine portraying current progress in the science , art , and business of lighting as seen from Nela Park . " During the first four years Scott set the tone of the magazine and did much of the spadework to assure its initial success . In 1928 Ralph W. Shenton took over as managing editor . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early in 1932 the activity was transferred from the Sales Promotion Division to the Engineering Division . Like his predecessors , Tugman built the magazine 's reader interest , circulation , and physical appearance . He served for 15 years as editor in chief . From the beginning , the aim of the editors was to make every story qualify as genuine news before it could be accepted . There was no room for routine publicity puffs . Throughout the period of intensive lighting education it has familiarized engineers , salesmen , designers , architects , and businessmen generally with " the science , art , and business of lighting . " BETTER LIGHT BETTER SIGHT BUREAU As a further means of forwarding lighting education , the Better Light Better Sight Bureau came into being in 1934 . This nonprofit organization with headquarters in New York City was supported by General Electric , Westinghouse , and ( a few years  | later ) Sylvania Electric Products , Inc. , together with the Edison Electric Institute . In its statement of organization it was defined as " an educational program under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better understanding of the relationship of light and sight . " From the beginning the Bureau engaged in no commercial activities , and the same is true today . It carries on its work of distributing information about eyesight conservation and good lighting through committees representing the membership . It publishes the Better Light Better Sight News , a magazine issued six times a year ; prepares study projects in the field of light and sight for school classes ; and provides a wide range of informational materials on home , school , office , and industrial lighting . ADVERTISING AND SALES PROMOTION General Electric lamp advertising brought Science of Seeing facts to the public during 1930 ? 1940 with a program unprecedented in the lighting industry . A high proportion of publication space and radio time was devoted to this information , as compared to straight selling of G-E lamps . It was an effective way to sell lamps because these instructive advertisements illustrated the many needs not ordinarily recognized . About this time General Electric made " bulbsnatcher " a household word . It designates the individual who robs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another socket . The cure for this sinister malady , of course , is to keep a good supply of spare bulbs on hand , so that every socket can always be filled with a lamp of the right size and type . During these years the other lamp manufacturers were , in their own ways , telling the world about the advances of good illumination . And all the lampmakers , including General Electric , were competing strenuously to sell their individual brands . As the better lighting program moved ahead , the General Electric district offices were provided not only with district engineers but with sales-promotion specialists as well . The information  | in both fields could be applied in day-by-day contacts with customers . There was no gap between Nela Park and the individual district manager and the sales force who were General Electric personified to the customer . The Nela Park operations remained as services to the districts rather than avenues of command . " Better light for better sight " was rolling smoothly along . Everyone in the Lamp Department could happily agree that selling better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development workers added more new products to the stream that had been flowing so steadily since 1930 . TYPE D LAMPS One development of the early thirties was not mentioned in Chapter 16 because it was related to the need for accurate and thorough public information about lamps and lighting as discussed here . About 1930 the American market began to be flooded with inferior bulbs made in Japan and exported to the United States . These bulbs were not bargains as compared to their General Electric counterparts . When the purchaser used such a lamp he often lost more than the price of the G-E lamp , in terms of the light he was paying for . The reasons for this were concerned with the over-all cost of light and with the life and light output of the lamps . In 1932 the list price of a 6o-watt standard inside-frosted G-E lamp was 20 cents . Its rated life was 1,000 hours . During that time it would use 6o kilowatt-hours of electricity . The average rate prevailing for current in 1932 was 5.6 cents per kilowatthour . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its long life . If one of the 6o-watt Japanese bulbs then on the market were less efficient than the G-E lamp by even 6 per cent , the loss of light would pay the full purchase price of the General Electric lamp . If the Japanese bulb were inferior by 10 per cent , the loss in light would be equal to more than 33 cents , as compared to the G-E lamp price of 20 cents . And the great majority of the Japanese  | bulbs were lower in comparative quality by considerably more than 6 or even 10 per cent . Even with the lower electrical rates we have today , lamps account for only 10 to 15 per cent of the total cost of light , depending on various conditions of service . The purchasers of the inferior imported bulbs , and of some other low-quality bulbs that were being made in the United States at about the same time , were losing a fair-sized proportion of the light they were paying for . Even if such lamps had been distributed free , they would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of bulbs called Type D lamps . They were not MAZDA lamps . Each of four sizes sold for 10 cents-6o-watt , 3o-watt , 15-watt , and 7%-watt . They were made available to satisfy customers who preferred to pay only 10 cents for a lamp even though it did not represent the top quality of design and construction exemplified in MAZDA lamps . The rated life of the 3o-watt and 6o-watt Type D lamps was soo hours ; life of the 15-watt bulb was 750 hours , and of the 7%-watt lamp , 1,400 hours . These lamps were better values than the inferior bulbs selling at the same price . General Electric carried on a campaign to show the public the false economy of buying lamps on the basis of price alone . Type D lamps never accounted for more than a very small percentage of the company 's total sales of lamps in the indicated sizes . A few years later G.E . discontinued the Type D line . NEW PHOTOFLASH LAMPS The first midget flash bulb was developed and introduced by G.E . in 1939 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation because of its convenience , its high light output , and its low cost . It greatly stimulated both amateur and professional photography indoors and out . In 1936 American patents were issued on a European development in the photoflash-lamp field . This was a lamp using small wires composed of magnesium and aluminum as the material to be ignited inside the bulb .  | The Wabash Appliance Corporation of Brooklyn , N.Y. , took a license on this lamp from the owners of the patents . Wabash began to manufacture and market the product in 1936 . ( After World War II Sylvania Electric Products , Inc. , purchased the Wabash company . ) Meantime the G-E experts in photolamps devised still another type , using finely shredded foil to provide the flash . These lamps , with improvements made during the next few years after their introduction ( 1940 ) , became the type settled on by General Electric as the best in the photoflash field . They are made today in several sizes for various photographic requirements . Also in 1940 General Electric placed flashtubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold A. Edgerton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , with the cooperation of General Electric . Edward B. Noel did the development work at Nela Park . These tubes made it possible to " stop " fast action in sports , industrial , and military photographs . They produced tremendously brilliant flashes of light over time intervals ranging from 1/i,000 to 1/l,000,000 second . The same tubes could be flashed repeatedly , some of them at frequencies up to io , 000 flashes per second . They consisted of small-diameter glass or quartz tubing , either straight or helically coiled . Into the ends metal electrodes were sealed . The tubes were filled with a rare gas ( usually xenon ) through which an electrical discharge took place . Rather complicated auxiliary equipment had to be used with them . For this reason , and because of the relatively limited applications , flashtubes remained very specialized products but withal rather dazzling ones . TUNGSTEN HEAT LAMPS The Ford Motor Company had pioneered in the application of infrared lamps for radiant heating and drying . In 1938 General Electric marketed lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used carbon filaments . The use of tungsten assured greater economy because of longer life and higher overall efficiency .
