Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> After sleeping through the night . Sir Winston Churchill awoke and learned that morning had brought big doings in his country home at Chartwell . Only a few steps from his bedroom , a kitchen oil stove had flared up , been doused by a maid and a house dick . <P> <P> With her guard held high , the Duchess of Windsor charged out of the neutral corner where she had stood fast for two decades after marrying Britain 's newly abdicated ex-King Edward VIII in 1937 . Occasion : McCall 's magazine this week began publishing her serialized autobiography , This Is My Side of the Story , which the duchess contends she wrote all by herself . In her " simple story , " the Baltimore-bred duchess , after confessing that " no one has ever accused me of being an intellectual , " rolls off into her halcyon childhood memoirs , interspersed with some harsh looks in the mirror . Sample reflection : " Women seem to be divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about for reasons for their own lack of reason . . . With the second group . . . I see something more : this has been , if not my personal tragedy , then my continuing folly .

" Promised by McCall 's in next month 's installment : " How she became a ' disillusioned Navy wife , ' how the night after their wedding she discovered that her husband liked to drink . . " <P> <P> Next fall , announced Washington 's Sidwell Friends School , " a limited number of qualified Negro students " will be admitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidwell : three children of Mississippi 's arch-segregationist Senator James O. Eastland , loudest voice of the bias-bawling white Citizens ' Council . On hearing the news . Mrs. Elizabeth Eastland gulped : " It comes as a surprise . " Affably drawled Jim Eastland : " No comment . " The Senator 's consolation , if he decides to let his children stay at Sidwell : unless his kiddies flunk several grades , or some of the late-coming Negro students are skipped upward , the Eastland children will not have colored classmates . <P>
