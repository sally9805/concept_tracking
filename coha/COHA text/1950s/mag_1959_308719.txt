NYASALAND <P> <P> To many an anxious Briton , the exploding events in distant Nyasaland seemed inexorably to be falling into the same old tragic pattern . " The Colonial Secretary , " taunted Labor 's Colonial Specialist Jim Callaghan , " can dust off all the phrases he used about Cyprus and bring them out again . " Callaghan continued , his emotion showing : " In the end , we shall concede to force what we failed to concede to reason . " But Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd , * in an almost swaggering parliamentary performance , was confident that the news he had up his sleeve would be enough to shock the Opposition into silence . <P> " Some days ago , " he said , planting his elbows on the dispatch box and gravely taking the House of Commons into his confidence , " information came to the notice of the government of Nyasaland of a very serious kind . " So serious was it , in fact , that the Governor of Nyasaland had declared a state of emergency . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose it , " said Lennox-Boyd , as the Opposition hooted . " But , in fact , a massacre was being planned . " <P> " Diabolic " Plots . The massacre that never happened was to remain the mystery of the week . Only the day before the emergency was declared , Nyasaland 's Governor , Sir Robert Armitage , had flatly stated that no such drastic action would be needed . Now Sir Robert had suddenly taken a stand that seemed contrary to everything that this elegant , liberal , and somewhat indecisive civil servant had ever stood for . He had helped speed <P> Ghana on her way to independence , and had been the mild Governor of Cyprus during the early days of trouble there ( 1954-55 ) . In Britain 's Central African Federation , a combination of black Nyasaland and the two Rhodesias , he has recently been increasingly at odds with tough-minded Sir Roy Welensky , Prime Minister of the federation . <P> Sir Roy , onetime locomotive engineer , insisted , as he later put it , that there were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then real violence culminating in assassination of whites and Africans . " In the end , Armitage , who himself expressed no such fears , transmitted them to London , proclaimed an emergency in Nyasaland , began mass arrests , and banned the African National Congress , which he conceded was the most popular political movement in a land where there are 3,000,000 blacks and only 8,000 whites . These fateful steps were taken after a week of jitteriness ( TIME , March 9 ) in which men lost their lives-but not one of them was white . <P> Messiah in a Bathrobe . In the dark , Jeeps began circling the Blantyre bungalow of Dr. Hastings Banda , Congress President and self-styled " extremist of extremists , " who has been leading the campaign against federation on the grounds that once the federation becomes independent , Nyasaland will be dominated by the apartheid-minded white minority of Southern Rhodesia . Scores of his followers , who regard him as their Messiah , gathered around to protect his house , but tear gas quickly dispersed them . Wrapped in a bathrobe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile in Southern Rhodesia .
