 | THE VIRGIN EGG 1 Much of my time as a biologist has been spent looking through a microscope at the beginnings of individual lives , partly in an effort to understand a little of how animals develop from eggs , partly and perhaps primarily in sheer fascination at the unfolding picture . It is something to be seen , although seen as action , and more and more you realize the truth of the philosopher Whitehead 's statement that the process itself is the actuality . When you sit down in the early morning and watch a myriad of dancing specks of spermatozoa buzzing around an egg , itself no larger to the naked eye than the smallest speck of dust , you are held entranced . Ahen you see that egg divide into two , into four , eight , sixteen , and more cells all closely united , and watch the ball of living substance gradually change its form until by evening , still small , it has a body and a tail , a simple eye and an organ for balance ? a miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen it . You can look at the events scientifically and do things to the egg or the embryo or the water in which it develops , and see what effect your interference has upon the outcome , as though you were winding up a clock or taking out this part or that to see what difference it might make to the may it runs ; but in the end what holds your mind and eye is the way the clock keeps time and the steady transformation of an egg into a tadpole , or whatever else it might be , between dawn and dusk . The development of a living active organism from a seemingly inert egg , while you watch and wait , is a miracle that never palls . So is the explosive vigor with which the process starts , when a sperm first enters an egg and releases the trigger . . The egg is launched on its course the instant the sperm hits its surface . Up to that moment its life has been sluggish , in a metabolic way , and the touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeping beauty . And this is no idle metaphor , for in every true sense of the word the egg is revitalized , and develops in consequence . Whether the eggs are minute like the eggs of the sea squirts , or enormous shell-protected gobs like the eggs of ostriches , or small but inaccessible , like those of elephants and human beings , the process is the same . An infinitely small spermatozoon , so small that ten thousand or more can be placed side by side and not cover an inch , must reach the surface of the egg ; and it must reach the egg while there is still some of its limited energy left in the little lashing tail . Such are the sex cells . Any small egg is much like another , no matter what kind of animal it finally becomes ? a starfish egg and a human egg are about the same size and look much alike , semitransparent and about one two-hundredth of an inch across , small enough by any measure except that of a spermatozoon . This is our starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of sex stems from it . Sex cells must be brought together so that eggs may be fertilized ; and eggs and sperm , for the most part , must come from different parents . And not all of it is for the sake of reproduction . If nature as a whole can be said to have an obsession it lies in the need to produce fertilized eggs and to launch them upon their career . And it calls attention to the difference between the sex cells ? why should they be so different ? The perennial human question concerning the equality of the sexes goes far beyond sex as we know it and finds its roots in the sex cells as such . Why are eggs and sperm so unlike , and what are their respective contributions to the organisms-to-be ? Much of it is simply a division of labor . It is difficult to be a jack-of-all-trades and do any particular job well . And the cell that is to develop into 59  | a new plant or animal must unite with another cell , and between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex than they are to begin with . So one kind stores the substance and the other does the traveling . In this way they get together and have enough to build with . Even the smallest egg is large for a cell , many times larger than a white corpuscle in your blood , while the egg of an ostrich may well be the largest cell in the universe . We will never know . But storing up material makes eggs round and large , and this alone renders impossible any movement on their part to meet a sperm . So it is all left for the sperms to do . All the responsibility for reaching an egg is theirs and theirs alone . They are simply cells with a delicate tail for swimming and everything else reduced to a minimum . Numbers are important too . At best the chances are slight that any particular sperm will ever make contact with an egg , and astronomical numbers are always necessary for successful fertilization . The largest possible number , and therefore the smallest possible size , is the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the larger the individual egg becomes , the farther it can progress along its course before it has to be an organism fending for itself . Large eggs are better than small eggs . Yet every animal and plant works on a budget and can set aside just so much material for producing sex cells . Large eggs mean fewer eggs and that is not so good . The greater the number of eggs produced the more likely some of them will survive to carry on the race . And so every race and species is torn between producing large eggs and enough eggs . It is a difficult choice and there is no single answer ? it all depends on circumstances . 2 CELL for cell the sexes are not equal ? a sperm is minute compared with even the smallest egg . Yet a male may hope to console himself with the thought that matter is not everything . What else is there ? As a rule an egg must be fertilized by a sperm in order to develop , but it is only as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more you look into the question . It all started more than half a , century ago when biologists were looking closely for the first time into the nature of the fertilization of an egg and of the processes involved ? sheer curiosity of the kind that led to the making of an atomic bomb . Only this merely put the male in his place . The experiments have been repeated ever since . Every summer in marine laboratories on the coasts students and others place ripe starfish eggs in seawater that has been tampered with , usually by the addition of a little organic acid , and they watch the eggs develop in consequence without the aid of spermatozoa at all . Apparently all the potentiality for development and the making of a new starfish is there in the egg itself . All it needs is a little push to get it started . Frog eggs are equally susceptible , although they need a somewhat different kind of push . It is a fascinating process and its practice is a common classroom exercise in most of the colleges throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need only some female frogs a month or two before the onset of their breeding season . If you inject one of them with extract of pituitary gland , that small but all-important gland that lies beneath the brain of every backboned animal from fish to man , the frog lays her eggs within twentyfour hours . It works almost every time and it is about the only way you can get fully ripened eggs entirely free from any sperm . For , once they are laid in a pond it is too late , and there would be spermatozoa around to confuse the issue . The release of the eggs by pressing a physiological button is impressive enough , but making them develop by mechanical means is more than that . The jelly that surrounds each egg is carefully removed by rolling it gently on blotting paper , so that the naked egg is exposed . Then , with extreme care , you prick its surface with the point of a fine glass needle . It is a delicate operation and the steadiest hand is all too clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two will start to divide and develop into a tadpole . And all such tadpoles will be males . Actually there is a clue here to sex as distinct from sex cells . The fully ripened egg of almost any kind of animal , if it will develop at all without being fertilized by a sperm , develops into a male . It takes a double dose of something to become a female . In the case of frogs and human beings there are two kinds of sperm , although they all look alike . One kind carries that extra component that added to an egg makes a female , the other kind does not . Since the two kinds are produced in approximately equal numbers , the chances are the same that one or the other kind will fertilize an egg . The result is that males and females are normally produced in equal numbers . Pricked frog eggs lack the spermatozoan contribution and are doomed to develop into males , if they develop at all . Parthenogenesis ? the long name for a short process , and meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods such as these in a number of different animals , particularly among the so-called lower forms . Simply raising the temperature will often do it in the case of frog eggs . It has been only natural to wonder if it can be accomplished in a mammal . In spite of ancient notions concerning conception and the general belief that all conceptions in human beings were the result of a spirit of some kind entering the womb of the woman , there is no good evidence that in mammals , whether human or other- wise , eggs ever naturally develop without being fertilized by spermatozoa . Such an occurrence is not implausible for it does happen in bees and other creatures , but not in mammals . And I doubt whether it is ever a natural event in frogs or starfish . Yet the thought lingers ; and sooner or later , as you might expect , someone would attempt to make mammalian eggs develop without benefit of paternity . The victims have been rabbits . Ripe but unfertilized mammalian eggs are notoriously hard to obtain , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France the embryologist Champy discovered among a group of unfertilized rabbit eggs cultivated outside the body , although at the body temperature , that some eggs underwent divisions as though they had been fertilized . Gregory Pincus , in America , followed this up and tried out all of the tricks we know that have made the eggs of lower animals develop spontaneously . But only an occasional egg ever reached a recognizable stage in embryo formation . The possibility of parthenogenesis seemed to be present , yet something was wrong . Apparently it is one thing to cause a mammalian egg to divide , it is another to keep it going in a normal manner ? which is not surprising when you consider that the mammalian egg is adjusted to develop in the tubes and womb of the mother . So Pincus treated the unfertilized eggs as before and then transplanted them into virgin rabbits . Out of a large number of trials , some of these virgins bore normal rabbits . In many others the embryos were well advanced but died prematurely . It is not very promising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing bulls . Perhaps it would be better if we should not be able to , for the human race so far shows no sign of knowing when or where to stop . 3 THE immediate interest of these rabbit experiments , to me at least , is that all the born and unborn offspring that have come from these unfertilized eggs have been females . The explanation goes back to the ripening of the egg . Starfish eggs , frog eggs , rabbit and human eggs all ripen normally in essentially the same way . When the fully grown egg leaves the ovary , whether to be shed into the sea if it is a starfish or to enter and lie in the oviduct if it is a mammal , it has to go through a process of division before it is ready to be fertilized . It divides , not into two equal parts as a cell usually does , but into a minute polar cell and one so large it looks like the original egg . And the event is important out of all proportion to its magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important in all of nature and throughout earthly time . For it is during this division that the differences arise that make one egg different from the next , that supply the raw material for evolution and adaptation to a changing world . Here is the general importance of it . The egg is different because of the division , and the polar cell is simply a by-product of the process . Yet sometimes the polar division is suppressed and the egg may still develop . That , according to another French investigator , is exactly what happens in those eggs that produce parthenogenetic female rabbits . The eggs retain a double quantity of the female component and develop into females . The rabbit eggs that do not retain the substance of the polar cell but ripen fully do not develop at all unless they are fertilized by a sperm . I doubt if this indicates the final fate of the human male , but it does suggest that if we ever succeed in producing a race , with eggs that develop spontaneously the result will be a purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the male ? in fact , no males could be expected , unless the system became elaborated . This may seem to be a fantastic speculation ; but it has happened to other creatures , and it goes on in spriflg or summer in almost any pond or pool where you can find the water fleas , Daphnia in particular . They swim with a jerky movement ? hence their name ? but they are as crustacean as a crayfish , and are not insects at all . Like all living things they belong to their environment , and what they have to do , in an almost literal sense , is to make hay while the sun shines . For they are specialists in living in small pools and even barnyard puddles , feeding on everything that is microscopic , whether it be plant cells , debris , or bacteria . As long as there is food of this sort and a certain amount of water , Daphnia and its kind can flourish . Sometimes when you come across a pond or a meadow pool the water is cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look closely you can see each small individual beating its way through the water with a pair of oarlike appendages , directing its movement with a solitary eye . Daphnias are creatures of a transient and intermittent world ? they flourish when the water comes , like flowers in springtime , and when the water has gone there is no more to be seen than the seeds of an annual plant . The eggs hatch out as miniatures of the parent , a statement that means more than it usually does , for not only does a young Daphnia look very much like an older ' one , but also it is a female like its mother . Every member of the brood which hatches out after rains or melting snow returns water to the pools in spring is a female . There are no exceptions . As the water warms and food becomes more plentiful the first broods of females mature and they in turn produce successive broods , each brood being carried in a sheltered pouch on the upper side of the parent . And each such brood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none is required ?  | the eggs develop without them and parthenogenesis is the rule . How it is that the eggs of Daphnia are able to develop spontaneously in the absence of spermatozoa I believe is beyond our present understanding , although it concerns the metabolic peculiarities of the eggs growing in the ovary . The reason that the Daphnia broods are all female is the same as for the rabbits of virgin birth ? the polar cell of the ripening egg is retained , the double dose of the sex determinant is present , and the outcome is female . Yet this is far from being the whole story , and when you put it all together it seems that the Daphnia is exquisitely adapted to the little world in which it lives . Given the ideal conditions , the Daphnia community remains exclusively female ; but this is an ever-changing universe , whatever its scale may be , and Daphnia , no more than we , can keep things perfect . The better the conditions the faster they breed , and the more they breed the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go around ? the time of trouble arrives . The response is almost miraculous . The signal may be the lack of space that comes from overcrowding , perhaps the irritation that even the lowliest forms of life exhibit when the course of travel is continually being interrupted ; it may be the sudden shortage of food that follows a population peak , or a sudden drop in temperature . A cold night and a chilly day may indicate the end of summer ; overcrowding may forecast either lack of food or lack of water to live in . Whatever it is , and all may be effective , the response is the same and it is a striking one . There are two steps in it . The first change is that broods of males appear in addition to the females . The males when grown are smaller , redder , and more active , for their role is to catch onto and mate with a female . Their redder blood may or may not be significant . What brings them into being is another matter . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development starts . The polar cell is given off , only a single unit of the sex determinant remains within the egg ? and a male develops instead of a female ; The environmental change affects the maternal organism so that the polar division of the grown egg is no longer suppressed , and the rest follows . It leaves us with the original problem ? how do the eggs manage to develop without the stimulus of a sperm ? Only some females in the community react like this and produce male offspring . Others go right ahead producing female broods , which shows that even in a purely amazonian community of parthenogenetic females , individuals react differently to a given set of circumstances . They are not all alike no matter what they seem to be . A scattering of males through the virgin paradise is the first step only . If the signal was a false alarm no harm is done : the females go on producing female broods and the males simply live out their lives without any propagative purpose ? as thwarted as in the Greek play Lysistrata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political welfare of the state . Yet in Daphnia society if condit ions go from bad to worse the second step is called into play . A cell in each female ovary grows to form an egg larger than any produced before ? and it completes its final process of polar division . If it could develop spontaneously it would be a male . But this time it does not and fertilization by one of the males already present is essential . These are the winter eggs that become enclosed in cases so tough that they are impermeable to water and are able to survive from one season to the next , like the wellprotected seeds of plants . Females emerge ? never a male ? because the sperm contributed the additional unit of sex determinant that usually came from the polar cell . And they emerge only in the spring or after such time that the shells have been cracked by alternate freczings and thaw ings or drying out . Only when water gets in do they complete their development and start the cycle over again . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little universe of their choice ? all for the sake of racial survival under difficult conditions .
