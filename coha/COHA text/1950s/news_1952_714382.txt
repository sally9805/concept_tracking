txt Bay State Republican leaders , eager to insure a 1952 party comeback , have turned to the preprimary convention system in an effort to frame a winning slate of statewide office candidates . Product of months of careful planning , the blueprint for a ? June 28 one-day " grass roots " assembly of 1.200 delegates in Worcester has been officially approved by the Republican State Committee . The committee vote was 58 to 2 , and it came after a long debate on procedure . The assembly will endorse one candidate ? each for United States senator , governor , lieutenant governor , secretary , treasurer , auditor , and attorney general . By this means , party leaders and workers hope to gain nomination of a slate at the Sept. 16 primaries with a racial and geographical balance lacking for many years in both Republican and Democratic tickets . Purpose of the convention endorsement system is to avoid repetition of the six-man primary contest for governor which in 1950 disrupted the party , dissipated campaign finances . and weakened the GOP election drive . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is whether candidates seeking endorsement of the convention delegates will agree to abide by the endorsements and refrain from running against en dorsed candidates in the primaries . If a strong gubernatorial candidate were to bolt the slate , it is possible he could upset the endorsed candidate . But even in the case of primary contests after the unofficial convention , it is felt that the convention-endorsed candidates will have the advantage of the all-out backing of the official party or ganizations , which in the past have remained officially neutral in primary battles . Under the plan approved by the Republican State Committee , delegates to the " grass roots " assembly will be chosen by ward and town committees to be elected at the official Republican preprimary elections on April 29 . Each ward and town will have one delegate plus one additional delegate for each 1,500 votes the ward or town cast for the Republican nominee for governor in the 1950 election . In addition , members of the sate committee elected on April 29 will he delegates automatically . Daniel Tyler , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , pointed out that any registered GOP voters can run for the ward or town committees . They must file their nomination papers with local registrars by IVIarch 4 . Choice by June 1.1.1 The plan calls for the committees to choose their convention delegates by June 10 . Delegates will be named from within the ranks of each committee , unless the committee , by a majority vote . decides to elect a delegate from outside the committee membership . Sinclair Weeks , Republican National Committeeman , and chairman of the advisory group , who in April . 1951 , announced a six-point Republican policy program with a preprimary convention as one 01 its major planks . asserted : - Thc proposed new grass-roots assembly is by no means a hap-. hazard , rump convention . an impro  --  ised straw ballot . or a dictated affair with candidates handpicked by a few . It is close to the people and it is run by the people . . . .                    @
