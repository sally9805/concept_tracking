From Tokyo this week , on the tenth anniversary of Pearl Harbor , TIME Correspondent Dwight Martin cabled a report on the state of Japan : <P> <P> SIX years ago , Emperor Hirohito , speaking to his people in the hour of defeat and surrender , composed a poem : <P> Man should be like the manly pine That does not change its color Though bearing the fallen snow . <P> Pearl Harbor Day , 1951 , finds Japan a rising sun once more , and the snow on the manly pine melting fast . The most dynamic , aggressive and industrialized people in Asia are again preparing themselves for the responsibilities and delights of sovereignty . Already the scene is changing . Trim , alert members of the National Police Reserve ( nucleus of the army Japan must inevitably raise to defend herself ) train with U.S. carbines , mortars , bazookas and light machine guns . The old zaibatsu ( financial cliques ) are reviving under new names . Recently a dozen offspring of the old Mitsubishi Commercial Co. combined into four large firms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people coming once more into their own ? Japan 's approaching independence portends an all-important shift in the balance of power in Asia . <P> For the present and for the foreseeable future , Japan is solidly encamped with the free world . But she is going to stay in camp on her own terms . Unfortunately stubborn SCAP brass give little if any indication that they appreciate the difference between an army of occupation and a security force in a sovereign nation . The occupiers ' unwillingness to give up the privileges-the luxury houses , the cheap and plentiful servants , the free schools-they have enjoyed for six years is understandable enough ; the men who have run the most benevolent occupation in history have little to apologize for . But they have a lot to learn . <P> For Foreigners Only . The Japanese are tired of the irritating inequalities of occupation . They have had more than enough of the sleek new cabs for " tourists " or " foreigners only , " the so-called specialty stores that sell luxury goods , tax free , to foreigners only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls , off limits to Japanese , where Japanese-made beer sells for a little under 20 a bottle ; the same beer , with tax , can cost the Japanese 90 or more a bottle . SCAP has started removing some of these irritations , but meanwhile it is adding others . During the past few months , the U.S. Army has replaced its inconspicuous jeeps with a fleet of 800 sleek , wide-bodied , olive-drab sedans , which use up more parking space in Tokyo 's already jampacked streets , while apparently serving no more useful purpose than a softer ride for occupation brass . <P> It is no secret that SCAP 's proposals for carrying out the terms of the security pact amount to little less than straightforward continuation of many aspects of the occupation . Ridgway 's advisers would like to keep the Dai Ichi Building ( No. 1 symbol of the occupation ) , the Imperial Hotel , the Ernie Pyle Theater and a host of lesser buildings and facilities in the Tokyo area . Even more important , particularly in the Orient where the word itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and civilian personnel . The prospect of such privileges led one member of the Japanese House of Councilors to speak of " a new occupation . " <P>
