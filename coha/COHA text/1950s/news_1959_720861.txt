txt The nation 's cranberry crop , estimated to have a retail value between $45,000,000 and $50 , - 000,000 , appeared likely yesterday to turn into a substantial loss . Across the country , a commotion started in Washington on Monday caused grocers to remove cranberry products from their shelves and restaurants to drop cranberry sauces from menus . In New York City , several grocery chains and restaurants followed this trend . Similarly , the city 's Health Commissioner , Dr. Leona Baumgartner , joined municipal authorities elsewhere in advising against the use of the berries until they could be tested for contamination . Cranberry growers were embittered . They had been in the process of distributing a record or near-record crop of 1,249 , - 000 100-pound barrels for the Thanksgiving and Christmas markets . The growers also called for the resignation of Arthur S. Flemming , Secretary of the Department of Health , Education and Welfare . They described his statement in Washington on Monday , which set off the furor , as " irresponsible , " " ill-informed and ill-advised . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cranberries grown in Washington State and Oregon had been found to be contaminated by a weed-killer known as aminotriazole . The chemical , he said , is believed to induce a cancerous growth in the thyroid of rats . Mr. Flemming said that no evidence of contamination had been found in the other major cranberry areas , Massachusetts , Wisconsin and New Jersey . However , he suggested that , unless the housewife knew the source of berries , she should " be on the safe side " and refrain from buying . The reaction was immediate yesterday . A &; P Food Stores ordered cranberries and cranberry products to be removed at once from its stores . Other large food chains followed . Among those in New York were Gristede Bros. , the Grand Union Company and the H. C. Bohack Company . A number of restaurant chains removed cranberry sauce from their menus . These included Schrafft 's , Stouffer 's , the Horn &; Hardart automats and the White Turkey restaurants . Following Dr. Baumgartner 's advice not to buy canned or fresh berries for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Health Department to make an investigation . State health officials in Ohio and city authorities in Chicago and San Francisco banned all cranberry sales . Michigan and Kentucky called for a voluntary suspension of sales . In Washington State , grocers were told by the state director of agriculture to remove all fresh and processed cranberries from their shelves . The effect upon growers followed swiftly . In Hanson , Mass. , George C. 0 . Olsson , president of Ocean Spray Cranberries , Inc. , a cooperative that markets 75 per cent of the nation 's crop , said cancellations of orders were pouring in . In South Wareham , Mass. , independent growers described the situation as " disastrous . " Melville Beaton , one of the largest operators there , laid off his 250 workers and closed his plant at 11 A. M. The equivalent of fifty carloads of berries lay in his warehouse . In New Lisbon , Hunterdon County , New Jersey , an emergency meeting was held by the executive committee of the American Cranberry Growers ' Association , representing New Jersey growers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement as " a flagrant example of irresponsible government at its worst . " It also declared that the association could " categorically report that the chemical has not been used here commercially on any bogs whatsoever . " In New York , Ambrose E. Stevens , executive vice president and general manager of Ocean Spray Cranberries , Inc. , held a news conference : He announced that he was sending a telegram to Secretary Flemming , which read in part : " In justice to thousands of cranberry growers and distrib. - utors and millions of consumers , we demand that you take immediate steps to rectify the incalculable damages caused by your ill-informed and ill-advised press statement yesterday . " You are killing a thoroughbred in order to destroy a single flea . " You must know that there is not a shred of evidence that a single human being has been adversely affected by eating allegedly contaminated cranberries . " You must know there is not a single bit of evidence that aminotriazole causes cancer in human beings . " You must know there is nothing to indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on any grocer 's shelf , in any distributor 's warehouse or any packer 's plant . Agencies ' ' Dispute Blamed ' Mr. Stevens contended that the growers had been the victims of a jurisdictional dispute between the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration . In 1957 , soon after the weedkiller was introduced , he said , some growers used it before it had been approved by the Department of Agriculture and under confused directions . About 3,000,000 pounds of cranberries were impounded and later destroyed . In 1958 aminotriazole was approved for use , but only after the harvest . ' Mr. Stevens said there was no reason to believe that there had been any improper use in that year , but he conceded that there was no positive assurance of this . Processed cranberries of 1958 are still in circulation . In this year American Cyanamid Company , one of the makers of aminotriazole , applied to the Food and Drug Administration for a determination of tolerance , or the , measure of how much aminotriazole residue on food could be considered harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration reported that aminotriazole , in dilution of ten parts in a million , had been found to cause thyroid cancer , in rats . It refused to make a tolerance rating . Thereupon , Mr. Stevens continued , Ocean Spray Cranberries directed all of its growers to stop the use of the weed-killer . Sworn affidavits were required from all growers that they had used the material only after harvest , as required . Of 1,079 growers , only ten or eleven declined to sign affidavits , Mr. Stevens said , and their crops were impounded . Also impounded were some other crops suspected of . having been contaminated by ' drift from adjoining areas where the chemical had been used to kill weeds and poison ivy . All told , about 3,000,000 pounds of berries , less than 1 per cent of the crop , were impounded . The toxic effect of aminotriazole on humans was questioned in a statement yesterday by American Cyanamid . The statement said : " According to competent toxicologists who have extensively studied the chemical , the extremely small amounts present on cranberries could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heightened " They point out that tumors were found in rats only after a lifetime of feeding in a diet containing approximately 100 times as much of the chemical as has been found on the contaminated lots of cranberries , and that cranberries constitute only a small fraction of the total human diet .. " They further pbint out that humans would have to subsist almost entirely on a diet of these cranberries for years in order to approximate the con- ' ditions which caused tumors in the test animals . " Anger over Secretary Flemming 's statement was intensified because the cranberry growers have just completed the harvest of a crop believed to be better than the ten-year average . The Massachusetts Farm Bureau Federation telegraphed to President Eisenhower demanding the resignation of the Secretary . The message called his statement , made just before Thanksgiving , " callous and harmful , " and said that if he had had any evidence of a harmful residue from the chemical , " he has known it a long time .
