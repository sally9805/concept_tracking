Arthur Godfrey told his radio listeners last month that if an atom bomb should be dropped on the U.S. , the job of keeping Americans calm and well-informed would be handled by two men : Godfrey himself and Ed Murrow . He explained : " They chose us two because it 's pretty tough for guys to imitate our voices . You 'd know when you heard my voice or Ed Murrow 's voice that these were two guys you could depend on , and nobody was giving you any applesauce , see ? That 's the reason . . . " <P> This week , as the Federal Civil Defense Administration plan for A-day shaped up , it was clear that Godfrey and Murrow will have help in the supply of friendly and reassuring voices in the event of disaster . Other radio-TV personalities are slated to spell Godfrey and Murrow over a nationwide network . Well-known regional stars are scheduled to take over various statewide hookups ; metropolitan areas will be told what is happening and what they should do by local disk jockeys and announcers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Conelrad " ( for Control of Electromagnetic Radiation ) . It will go into effect the instant hostile aircraft are detected approaching the U.S. All TV and FM transmitters will go off the air . All AM transmitters will either be silenced or will switch their frequencies to 640 and 1240 on the dial of any standard receiver . This technical jugglery is necessary in order to prevent enemy pilots from getting a " fix " on a normal radio beam and riding down its path to drop bombs on a target city .
