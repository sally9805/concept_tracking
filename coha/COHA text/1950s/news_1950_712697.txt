txt Two investigations were under way yesterday into the wreck on the Long Island Rail Road in which twenty-nine passengers were killed and at least seventy-nine others were treated at hospitals . Ten of the injured were still on the critical list last night . Involved in the collision , one of the worst in the state 's history , were the 10:03 train from Pennsylvania Station to Babylon and the 10:31 from Babylon to New York . The crash occurred near Rockville Centre about 10:40 P. M. on Friday . Arrested but permitted to remain at home because of injuries was the motorman of the Babylonbound train . He was accused of criminal negligence and manslaughter in the second degree . The motorman is Jacob Kiefer , 55 years old , of 69 Church Street , Baldwin . He will be arraigned tomorrow in the First District Court at Mineola . The motorman of the westbound train , J. W. Markin , was questioned and released . Dater District Attorney Frank A. Gulotta of Nassau County said no charges would be made against Mr. Markin . Failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement by Mr. Gulotta to the effect that the accident was caused by human rather than by mechanical failure , tended to support the stand of the railroad . Officials of the road said the accident had been caused by the failure of the motorman of the eastbound train to heed a stop signal west of the point at which the trains collided almost head-on . As the battered bodies were being identified at hospitals and the morgue it became known that among the dead were Harold W. Worzel , a leader of the Democratic party in Suffolk County , and John M. Weeks , a contributing editor of Time Magazine , Inc . Train service along the stretch in which the accident occurred , just west of the Rockville Centre station , was resumed by 10:30 o'clock in tip morning and was normal by afternoon . Two Points Being Checked Though Public Service Commission officials would not comment on early findings , it was known that they were checking two points . First , - they were investigating reports that the train bound for New York was three minutes behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been no accident . Second , they were trying to figure why , assuming a motorman had gone through a signal light , he could not have seen an oncoming train or have been seen by the motorman of the approaching train . For more than three blocks in the vicinity of the accident the roadbed is level and the tracks make no curves . Since visibility was good Friday night and the train lights were functioning , it was not immediately apparent why the motormen of these trains could not have had time to stop and avert the accident . Furthermore , it was explained , though the first car of the westbound train was virtually sheared in two by the impact , it was not understood why either train should have reached- great speed . The westbound train had just pulled out of the Rockville Centre station and the eastbound train should have been slowing down to stop there . Most of the victims in the crash had been sitting on the left side of each of the colliding cars . This may have been the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right side of the car . An explanation of the fact that so many persons were in the first car was that the first and last cars of these trains are usually smoking cars . No Automatic Device at Scene Though there were two signal lights within a mile west of the scene of the accident there was no automatic device , such as is used on city subways , to trip trains that go through signal lights . The last signal light passed by the eastbound train was 100 feet from the spot of the accident . The police said that the trains had collided a few yards beyond a sort of one-way track system known as a " gantlet . " . The trains met just after the New York bound train had part of its first car off this " gantlet . " The left sides of the first cars of each train meshed . A gantlet , though it has four rails , allows- passage of only one train at a time . This is because the tracks overlap each other , one rail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of track is laid down temporarily , as a rule . In this case it was being used because grade-crossing work was being done near by . 40 Detectives Gathering Data While cranes removed twisted cars from these tracks yesterday morning , more than forty detectives began questioning passengers and conductors on the two trains , which were believed p have carried 1,000 persons . Most of the interrogation by the police was done at the homes of passengers . This phase of the investigation was under Assistant Chief Inspector Stuyvesant Pinnell . He refused to discuss the information obtained by his- men . Commissioner George A. Arkwright of the Public Service Commission announced that there would be a joint hearing by his group , the Interstate Commerce Commission and the railroad on Wednesday at the offices of the Long Island Rail Road in Jamaica , Queens . Mr. Arkwright spent Friday night in evening clothes clambering around the wreckage after he had been summoned from the Emerald Ball at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel . He refused to discuss a proceeding already pending before the Public Service Commission involving the Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in its basic one-way fares .
