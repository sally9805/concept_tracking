Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> In Philadelphia for the pleasant chore of picking up $70,000 contributed to his library fund ( TIME , June 21 ) , Harry Truman told a banquet audience why he believes that presidential papers belong to the public . Said Librarian Truman : " Through the documents . . . you can find out , and the scholars of the future can find out , what the man in the White House at the time was thinking about when he did those things . It is very easy to be a Monday-morning quarterback and tell a man what he should have done . <P> Many people have told me what to do-afterward . . . But I was there then and they were not . . . Mud and other dirt was thrown at us , and I felt like whipping a lot of people , but I could n't get to them . " <P> <P> Indefatigable Evangelist Billy Graham paused at Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel long enough to receive the Salvation Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfailing faith . " Then , after announcing that he is off to Europe in March for a six-month preaching tour , he headed for Georgia to relax for three days at Augusta 's National Golf Club , a favorite course of President Eisenhower . Asked if he planned to play a round with Ike , Graham , whose scores hover in the so-so 90s , laughed and said : " I do n't play that good a game . " Meanwhile , Hollywood was expecting Graham to play something easier : the role of Billy Graham in a movie about his conversion of a onetime Los Angeles thug . <P> <P> With a loud flourish of trumpets , the Liebmann Breweries ( fourth largest in U.S. ) announced that next year 's Miss Rheingold , elected over some 1,200 other sudsy beauties by the nation 's beer-lovers , will be elfish Nancy Woodruff , 21 , a homespun girl from Oakland , Calif . But what really made Nancy newsworthy was her affinity for fluids : she was last year 's Miss Anti-Freeze . <P> <P> The Soviet Union 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also nimbly toes the political line , gave an audience to the New York Herald Tribune 's comely Newshen Marguerite Higgins , who opened the conversation by asking : " Has your career . . . brought you happiness ? " <P> " It is a strange thing . Often , after a big performance there is much applause . . . I receive many curtain calls and many flowers . And yet , sometimes , when I am back home , I find there is a desert in my heart . " <P> <P> " To what do you attribute your success ? " <P> <P> " Terribly hard work . Today is Sunday . Already I have practiced three hours . " <P> " How strict are your disciplines ? Can you . . . occasionally have a drink of vodka ? " <P> <P> " Of course ... Vodka gives you strength - and sometimes courage ! " <P>
