As they walked out into the White House rose garden last week for their public leavetaking , Dwight Eisenhower and Saudi Arabia 's King Saud exchanged a double handclasp that signified to all the world a diplomatic achievement of first importance . As the delegated eyes and ears of the combustible Egyptians , Syrians and Jordanians , Saud now thoroughly understood-if he could not yet publicly embrace-the Eisenhower doctrine . The talks , as President Eisenhower told his press conference , had cleared away much of " the underbrush of misunderstanding " ; now the seeds could be planted , and clearly Saud would be a valued planter of U.S. offers of friendship and protection among his fellow Arabs . <P> Concert of Voices . The momentum of U.S. diplomacy carried even farther than Saud . Lebanon 's Foreign Minister Charles Malik , a tried and true U.S. friend himself , met with the President , conferred with Saud , observed to waiting reporters that the King is a " real friend of the U.S. " Still another Middle Eastern voice , that of natty Crown Prince Abdul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony . Like Saud , with whom he met after seeing the President , Illah was speaking for a bloc-Turkey , Iran , Pakistan , Iraq-which is already closely allied with the West through membership ( with Britain ) in the Baghdad Pact .

King Saud , who had extended his visit a week beyond the three days originally scheduled , prepared for his departure in high spirits .

No secret was the King 's enormous gratitude for the way Americans had opened their arms to Saud 's lame little son ( see below ) . The King himself was the richer , materially , in five pairs of eyeglasses , which he ordered after an eye examination at Walter Reed Hospital . <P> At week 's end Vice President Nixon , with his wife and children , went in the rain to Washington 's National Airport to bid the King goodbye . As Saud boarded a Constellation bound for the Azores , where a Spanish plane would transport him to his next stop in Spain , Nixon said he hoped that the bad weather " does n't leave a bad impression on Your Majesty . " Replied Saud of Arabia : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the warmth of the heart . "
