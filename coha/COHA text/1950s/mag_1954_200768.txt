The nation 's secret files may be successfully barred to Communists , and sometimes to just plain newsmen , but they are wide open to television writers . TVmen boast that they have their grubby fingers in the file cabinets of the Treasury Department ( Treasury Men in Action ) , the Bureau of the Chief Inspector , Post Office Department ( The Mail Story ) , the Los Angeles Police Department ( Dragnet ) , the FBI ( I Led Three Lives ) , the National Legal Aid Association ( Justice ) . the Los Angeles County Medical Association ( Medic ) , and the San Francisco Police ( The Lineup ' ) . Public Defender ranges from coast to coast in grabbing " actual cases on file in courts across the country , " and U.S. newspaper morgues are looted to get plots for The Big Story . Last week Du Mont presented a new show . Secret File , U.S.A. , that was so classified that no one connected with it was quite sure just what supersecret file they were into . An executive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There 's a tie in there between the chief writer and somebody in the OSS during the war . " <P> Secret File stars Robert Alda , and its first script had a touchingly old-fashioned air . Alda , dressed in Nazi uniform , crept into wartime Germany to locate the factory where Hitler was manufacturing a bacteria bomb . There were squads of brutal and booted Gestapo , a beautiful barmaid ( Was she enemy or friend ? ) , a German professor who recoiled from making weapons for mass destruction . Alda had plenty of opportunity to make a stiff upper lip and to say things like " I 'm only doing a job that has to be done . " <P> Other new shows of the week : <P> Spectacular No. 3 ( Sun . 7:30 p.m. , NBC ) starring Judy Holliday , Steve Allen and a new comic named Dick Shawn , was a disappointment . Intended as a salute to Manhattan 's City Center of Music and Drama , the show never got airborne . Funnyman Shawn opened with a long and painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given little material with which to overcome that initial handicap . The best number featured Judy as a short-order waitress who gets involved in a ballet rehearsal ; the most tedious-except for confirmed balletomanes - was a 20-minute dance revolving about a filling station . <P> Honestly , Celeste ! ( Sun . 9:30 p.m. , CBS ) lets Comedienne Celeste Holm play hob with a newspaper office and appears to have been created by the second-string writers of NBC 's Dear Phoebe , which is also a situation comedy laid in a newspaper office . <P> Father Knows Best ( Sun . 10:00 p.m. , CBS ) is another one of CBS ' patented family comedies that bear far more relation to each other than they do to life . Everyone from father Robert Young to Junior ( Billy Gray ) handles his untaxing chore with competence . All the situations and every response to them should be completely familiar to experienced televiewers.
