txt Colonel Nasser , Egypt 's dictator . is trying to make his seizure of the Suez Canal a rallying point for all the stirrings in the Arab world . The stirrings are very real . " The use of them , in one way , by one man , for one purpose , deserves close attention . There is good reason to believe that Colonel Nasser sees himself in the light of a " leader of all the Arabs . " He has talked with some force about an Arab state or empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Sea . He has made consistent efforts to bring small Arab states under his banner and has proclaimed his  --  and presumably their  --  resistance to the Western a , u- , thority and influence that he be- I lieves inimical to the cause of a pan-Arabism . In addition Colonel Nasser has I set out to encourage and exploit any support that he could get from non- I Arab sources . The Soviet Union , naturally , can be counted upon to I take positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve problems in a rational way . Red China has already announced its sympathy with the Egyptian dictator . India is committed " against the use of force , " meaning , if anything , that the Western World should accept Nasser 's fiat , rather than to resort to stern measures against it . Indonesia is fully sympathetic , since Nasser has now made himself " antiWestern , " which suits perfectly the ! Torrent mood in Jakarta . Tne ahgnment or Iraq , as an Arab nate . behind Egypt is a blow to the V1/444/ world . It illustrates the strength of tome kinships even if they oppose long-range interests . Iraq is a member of the Baghdad Pact but has chosen to weaken this association  --  a defensive alliance  --  to make cause with Egypt against the West . There is an explosive factor in the raising of the cry of " jehad , " or holy war , in Cairo . It is not honest . The Arab states are Moslem , but the issues at stake are not religious . In fact the two strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not Arab . For that matter , neither is Moslem Indonesia . A settlement of the basic problems of operation of the Suez Canal in the interests of the whole maritime world , Egypt included , offers no threat to Islam . On the other hand , the suggestion of a great pan-Arab state is provocative . It involves the status of Arabs who are living under French rule or French protection in North Africa . It involves the status of physically weak Arab states , such as Yemen and Saudi Arabia , that have enormous resources in petroleum . The economic position of these states is dependent upon the use of Western skills , and the availability of a Western market . Proper use of those skills and that ' market can eventually be ' of enormous importance to the welfare of each individual Arab . Progress has been made and will continue if there are peace and stability . How Egypt can play the dominant role at this point , however , is problematical . Egypt is not a petroleum producer , nor even a significant consumer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market and must use the wealth of that agriculture to raise living standards that are pitifully low . The Soviet Union does not want Arabian oil . It is competitive . Egypt and the Arab world will continue to need the free West for the very development that offers them hope . But Arab " nationalism " is not always rational . It has been pur blind in its opposition to the creation and growth of Israel . It would- be self-defeating if it impeded the full use of a great international resourcesuch as the Suez Canal . It is courting disaster if it asks the sympathy and support of the Communists , one of whose most highly specialized techniques is the exploitation Of " nationalist " movements , for the greater glory of the super-nationalist Soviet " Union . There is certainly no reason why peoples who have a common bond , such as the Arabs , should not come together for their own common good . But it is essential that they , and we , understand that their association is for that good and not for the aggrandizement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eventual entrapment of the whole group by a conspiracy against their eventual liberty .
