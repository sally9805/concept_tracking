BEHIND KHRUSHCHEV 'S SMILE ' Mt manner of man is Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev , the bald and jovial miner 's son who is heir-apparent to the tyranny of Jo , eph Stalin ? The question is important , since a great deal  --  perhaps war or peace for the tired world  --  may depend on the answer . Most men are like artichokes . As you get to know them better , you peel off layer after layer of character , finding constant subtle changes in taste and texture . Yet even the heart of the artichoke , the innermost man , is recognizably like the outer layer . There are other men  --  all of us know a few  --  who show a face to the world quite different from their more private personality . And this , in turn , may conceal an inner , secret nature  --  the heart of the human artichoke  --  which is quite different again . Such a man is Nikita Khrushchev . A couple of years ago , in Moscow , I saw the outer Khrushchev , the genial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several months ago , my brother , Joseph Alsop , in a long interview with Khrushchev , saw something of the serious , shrewd , immensely able man concealed behind the outer facade . And if you examine his history carefully , it is also possible to glimpse a good deal of the heart of the Khrushchev artichoke , the innermost Khrushchev of all  --  the daring , passionately ambitious , carefully calculating , bloodstained man who has clawed his way , grinning all the time , through mortal danger and constant betrayal to the very top of the Soviet power heap . When you have examined these several layers of the Khrushchev personality , you can only conclude that Nikita Khrushchev , however evil his past and uncertain his future , is one of the most remarkable human beings our tortured era has produced . Yet he does not look or seem or behave like a particularly remarkable human being . And that , as we shall see , is one secret of his astonishing career . When I was in Moscow all the Soviet rulers were constantly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEWART ALSOP the era of Soviet smiles . The smiles came hard to some of the then Presidium members  --  for Molotov and Malenkov , particularly , smiling W41% a painful muscular exercise . But for Khrushchev , smiling was easy . For Khrushchev is obviously a man who quite genuinely loves a party . He would bounce about , guzzling champagne , grabbing some terrified child of a Western diplomat in his thick , stubby arms or passionately denouncing some aspect of American policy , but enjoying every minute of it , whatever he did . It was on his own initiative that I met him . At the French Bastille Day party , he asked to meet " the American journalist , Gospodin Alsop . " I was ushered into the presence , and when I put out my hand to shake his , he grabbed it in both his hands , and held on tight . grinning and peering at me intently with his little dark eyes . " I have read what you have written about my country , " he said . through an interpreter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he hung on grimly . " I do not like what you have written . " he said , grinning ferociously . I muttered again . " Perhaps you will return to my country someday , and then you will write the truth about it . " I said I always did my best to write the truth , and he said nothing , but still gripped my hand , and looked me up and down like an amused entymologist inspecting some particularly outlandish hug . Finally my journalistic instincts asserted themselves , and I began asking him questions about the Geneva meeting . After a little while he released my hand , and placed the tip of his forefinger on his shapeless nose , and grinned a last grin . " No , no , Gospodin Alsop , " he said , " you arc trying to interview me , and that I can not permit . " It was a brief encounter , and hardly a journalistic triumph , but it left me fascinated with Khrushchev as a human personality . Why did he ask to see me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I think he wanted to see for himself what manner of beast this new thing in his life , an " imperialist " Western journalist , was like . For he had not then met many Western journalists , and my brother and I are better known in Russia than anywhere else , since we arc constantly denounced in the Soviet press as " murderers , " " rapists " and " running dogs of thc imperialists . " Whether or not this guess was right . the Khrushchev I met so briefly that day struck mc as a strangely compelling personality . He is really a remarkably ugly man , with his wispy-bald pate , his tiny blue-black eyes , the three prominent wens on his cheek , and the two gold teeth  --  a proud symbol of high station in the Soviet Union  --  in his loose-lipped mouth . And yet the man has a certain charm  --  there is no other word for it . It is the physical charm which enormous vitality sometimes conveys  --  most Rooscvelts have the same physical charm . This abundant vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wens or his gold teeth . On his visit of penance to Tito 's Yugoslavia in June , 1955 ? the West 's first real opportunity to have a good hard look at the man  --  a reporter asked him if he was tired . " Of course not , " said Khrushchev , surprised , " I am a strong man . " The reporter admitted that he himself was tired , " from following you around . You run here and then you run there . " " Let mc tell you something , " said Khrushchev . " Life is short . Live it up . See all you can , hear all you can , and go all you can . " Khrushchev undoubtedly believes quite genuinely in this peculiarly American doctrine of the strenuous life . And indeed , in the outer Khrushchev at least , there arecertain seemingly American characteristics . One of the games of the bored and isolated American community in Moscow is to lit the Kremlin 's rulers into American political roles . Bulganin , for example , is Senator Claghorn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rather old-fashioned figure with his goatee and his loose linen suit , gallant to the ladies , partial to old bourbon , and totally reactionary . But if Bulganin isClaghorn , Khrushchev  --  the outer Khrushchev  --  is the indefatigable joiner and tribune of the pee-pul , a backslapper , an easy user of first names , with a story to suit every occasion . Sometimes , to be sure . Khrushchev 's stories are not exactly ' appropriate . On his visit to London , for example , he pointed to the hideous Albert Memorial and asked what it was . On being told it was erected by Queen Victoria in memory of her consort , he said he was reminded of the story of the husband of a famous ballerina in Moscow . A stranger asked what the man did . Told that he was the husband of the most beautiful ballerina in Russia . the stranger replied , " Yes , I know that , but what does he do in the daytime ? " Khruschev 's entourage of British otficials smiled thinly at this sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Khrushchev , unabashed , laughed uproariously , slapping his thighs . Some of his stories have rather grim implications . He tells an old one , for example , about a review of massed troops in Moscow . Someone sneezes in the ranks . The chief of the Cheka  --  the Czarist secret police  --  asks who sneezed . There is no answer . The first line of troops is stood up against a wall and shot . Again , the Chekist asks who sneezed . Again no answer , and another line of troops is shot . Again the question is asked . A timid voice at the rear says , " I snee/ed . " " Gc  --  undbeit , " says the top cop . Another Khrushchev story concerns a professor who is complaining to a friend in the Cheka about the stupidity of his pupils . " Why , so-and-so , " he says . " even admitted that he did n't know the author of Eugene Onegin la famous work by Pushkin ) . " A couple of days later , they meet again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind at rest . " The student wrote it , " he says proudly . " He has signed a full confession . " Although these stories are supposedly laid in Czarist days , their applicability to the present and the recent past in the Soviet Union is entirely obvious , and Khrushchev , of course , is entirely aware of it . He has told , in the hearing of foreigners , one story laid in the present which even suggests that he has a sense of humor about himself , something no other dictator in history has had . The story is about a man who was arrested for rushing through the corridors of the Kremlin , shouting , " Khrushchev is a fool , Khrushchev is a fool ! " The man was sentenced to twenty-three years in prison camp . " Three years for insulting the party secretary , twenty years for resealing a state secret . " Khrushchev has , apparently , no inhibitions about the political implications of such anecdotes . Indeed , in his public role as the genial and droll buffoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or personal . Soviet officials are ex tremely uncommunicative about their private lives , but Khrushchev likes to talk about his family  --  if he were an American , he would no doubt carry photographs of his offspring in his wallet , and display them to every chance acquaintance . He talks often of his eldest son , a pilot killed in the War , and he brought another son  --  a shy , bespectacled student engineer  --  to Britain with him , and behaved toward him much like any other father showing junior the sights abroad . Khrushchev  --  the public Khrushchevalso likes to talk about his hobbies , which include raising rabbits , growing fruit trees and shooting ducks . At one rather vinous luncheon in Britain , he launched into a long and eloquent dissertation on the joys of duck hunting , describing , with a touch of poetry , the sound of the water lapping about the boat , the dawn flights over the marshes , the sibilant fluttering of the wings of an incoming flight . He pleased his British hosts by remarking that the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said proudly , a pair of Purdys and a pair of Hollandswhich suggests the privileges accruing to the Soviet ruling class , since the going price for Khrushchev 's shotguns is about SS000 . Is this outer layer of the Khrushchev artichoke , the Khrushchev the world sees , a mask designed to fool the world ? It seems likely that it is not . No doubt Khrushchev really does love to grow fruit trees , raise rabbits , shoot ducks , tell funny stories , drink champagne , and go to parties . And yet , as we shall see , this outer layer , the genially extroverted Khrushchev , which Khrushchev shows to the world , has served Khrushchev well , and Khrushchev knows it . So much , then , for the outer layer . My brother . Joseph , had a two-hour look at the second layer in a long interview with Khrushchev some months ago . Soon after the interview , with his impressions fresh in his mind , he wrote me about his reactions to the man , and the letter seems worth quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khrushchev and the man seen at close range in serious discussion struck me very forcibly indeed . I had watched him at all the big parties , and he never acted like a real Number One in a dictatorship . To be sure , when Khrushchev 's turn came in the endless round of toasts and speeches , the word would go round , ' It 's K who 's getting up , ' and everybody would fall silent . He talked with more authority than the others too . But he did not otherwise take the center of the stage especially . He never scented , to my surprise , to take too much to drink . Bulganin is the real compulsive drinker . But nothing in Khrushchev 's outward appearance inspired respect , and he did not seem to want respect either . Instead . at least half the time , what he seemed to want was a good laugh promoted by himself . " When I interviewed him , on the other hand , he was entirely different  --  in control from the start , obviously quick-minded io @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and altogether most impressive . I thought him one of the most intellectually powerful , tough , pragmatic and energetic-minded men I have ever run into in our way of business  --  maybe the most of any . " 65 Here , then , is the most important thing to understand about the second Khrushchev layer  --  the layer that underlies the comic exterior with thc gap-toothed grin . Khrushchev is a man of quite extraordinary powers and abilities . The comparison is in a sense obscene , but Khrushchev does share certain qualities with Winston Churchill . Like Khrushchev , Churchill has retained into old age enthusiasms which would seem downright childish in a more sober-sided and less talented man . Khrushchev 's enthusiasm for raising rabbits is matched by Churchill 's even odder passion for raising goldfish , and both men like to make jokes and drink copiously . As in Churchill 's case , Khrushchev 's small enthusiasms reflect his enormous drive , his vitality , his restless compulsion to be up and doing . Like Churchill , Khrushchev prides himself on his encyclopedic knowledge . Visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts and figures on subjects ranging from American corn production to Soviet electrical output . Again like Churchill , Khrushchev  --  who is very proud of his wartime service , with the rank of lieutenant general , on the Stalingrad front  --  is fascinated by the arts of war . Churchill is credited with being father of the tank . If there is any one father of the Sputniks and the Soviet ICBM 's , it is Khrushchev . Khrushchev loses to talk about his missiles . In part , clearly , this is because he feels an irrepressible pride , like the pride of a small boy on Christmas day , in the shiny new toys his brilliant scientists and engineers have given him . He brought the greatest Soviet aircraft engineer , A. N. Tupolev , to Britain with him , and showed him off like a prize bull , referring possessively to him as " our man Tupolev . " At the 1955 Red Air Force Day , an American air attach ? had an inspiration while the big flights of new jet bombers were flying overhead at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing stand , and saw Khrushchev jumping up and down with glee , laughing like a boy and thumping the staid Bulganin on the back . Khrushchev 's enthusiasm for his bright new toys is more , of course , than merely boyish . He is thoroughly aware of the effect of such new weapons advances on the world power balance , and aware , too , of the usefully intimidating effect of the public display of such weapons . It was no accident that the big bombers flew at tree-top lesel in 1955 , for all the world  --  and especially the Americans  --  to see , or that the Sputnik launchings were accompanied by the loudest possible thumpings of the Soviet propaganda drums . But it is no accident , either , that the immense advances in Soviet air and missile power have coincided with the period of Nikita Khrushchev 's personal ascendancy . Khrushchev 's fascination with the arts of war is matched by a lose , which is also Churchillian , of launching vast new enterprises and running them in the most personal way , in infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill 's great gamble at the Dardanelles failed . Khrushchev 's " Agrogorodprogram for transforming the Soviet collective-farm system into a great industrial complex failed dismally  --  and Khrushchev quickly blamed the failure on Malenkov . It remains to be seen whether a couple of even bigger gambles  --  the " new-lands " program for developing agriculture on the and Siberian plains , and his program for decentralizing and basically transforming the Soviet industrial system  --  will succeed or partially succeed . But the point is that Khrushchev takes a positive pleasure , as real as his pleasure in a good story or a good drink , in launching and arts mg through great , risky new enterprises I ! ere another p.11.1-graph from iny brothers letter is worth quoting : " The strongest impression of his character that I received % ? as the 11111VCS%1011 that he is a cool and rather desperate gambler , who likes a gamble because it is a gamble . This impression came especially from the obvious delight he took in the magnitude of general mess and upset that his **25;914;TOOLONG plan was due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khrushchev ? ears have been full of gambles . The intrusion into the Middle East , which Stalin had abs ass regarded as too hot to handle . was a most serious gamble with American pass 's ity . To plow up the virgin lands was a huge gamble against the weather , and the industnal-reorganization plan is j gamble against the power of the great new Soviet bureaucratic-industrial class . " Churchill is a gambler too  --  the risks he took in the second World War often knocked the breath out of his advisers . But there is , of course , a difference between Churchill and Khrushchev far greater than any similarities  --  a difference which makes the comparison between them essential 's obscene . And here we approach the heart of the Khrushchev artichoke . For Churchill is , by the standards of our cis ilization , a man of virtue , in the true meaning of that word . By those same standards , Khrushchev is an evil man , sunk and steeped in evil . By his own standards , he is not evil . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . torn and weakened by a sense of guilt . On the contrary , though his life history has been a history of betrayal and sudden death . one can be quite certain that he feels not a single uneasy twinge of conscience as he looks back upon the past . On the contrary , he considers himself an upright pillar of his society . And that is just what he is . For it is a peculiar society , alien to our society in a way that very few Americans really understand . By our standards , murder and betrayal are by definition evil . But ours , in Khrushchev 's eyes , is a " bourgeois morality . " His morality is " Soviet morality . " Soviet morality is based on the doctrine of " Kra 2 " or " who ... whom ? " , first enunciated by V. I. Lenin . the man whom Khrushchev professes to revere  --  and quite probably does , in fact , revere  --  above all others . " Who . . . whom ? " means " Who beats whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this doctrine , it is not only desirable but highly moral for Communists to destroy those who are not Communists or who may threaten Communism . In Khrushchev 's famous " secret " speech denouncing the crimes of Stalin , surely the most astonishing document of our times . Stalin is never blamed for a moment simply for murdering people or betraying them . On the contrary , the betrayal of " nghtists " like Bukharin and the carefully planned murder-by-starvation of millions of peasants are listed among Stalin 's great " services " to the Communist cause . Terror , Khrushchev is at pains to make clear , is not by any means bad in itself . Lenin . he carefully points out , " when necessary , resorted ruthlessly and without hesitation . . . to the most extreme methods . " Stalin was wrong , according to Khrushchev . not because he killed a lot of people , but because he killed the wrong people  --  good Communists like Khrushchev himself . For Americans especially , brought up in a comfortable and good-humored land , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a man who likes to drink , and tell funny stories , and talk about his children  --  really sees nothing inherently : wrong in , for example , the planned starvation of millions of innocent people . But then , no Nmerican has lived a life even remotely like the life Khrushchev has lived . His forty adult years as a career Communist have conditioned him to accept the terrible tenets of " Soy ict morality " as surely as Doctor Pavlov 's pathetic dogs were conditioned to salivate when they heard a bell ring . Nikita Khrushchev was horn in 1894 , in a tiny , impoverished village on the edge of the Ukraine , When the revolution broke out in 1917 , he was twenty-three , and barely literate . He joined the Communist Party in 1918 , and ever since , the party has been his life and his reason for being . As a party " oppararchik , ? Khrushchev had climbed high enough on the party ladder to attend , in 1924. a ? ' roh- or party school . The year or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever got , and it was an education in the morality of " who . . . whom ? " A key moment in his life occurred in 1928 , when , as a minor party functionary in Kiev , he first met Lazar Kaganovich , only a year older , but already party boss of the Ukraine . Just what happened between the tough , rude-spoken Khrushchev , with his blond hair and his boundless energy , and the dour , dark-visaged , shrewd Kaganovich , no one will ever know . But it was a fateful meeting , for Kaganovich made Khrushchev his protege , and Khrushchev began his climb to the top . When Kaganovich returned to Moscow in 1929 , to head the Moscow Central Committee , Khrushchev followed hard on his heels . From that point on , it is easy to trace how Khrushchev moved steadily upward in the party hierarchy , still hard on the heels of Kaganovich , taking over from him as boss of the Moscow Central Committee , working as his No. 2 on the famous Moscow subway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of the great purges , when the doctrine of " who ... whom ? " was put to a hard test . And Khrushchev chose to be a w ho rather than a whom . As a purger , Khrushchev , like Kaganovich , was more Stalinist than Stalin . Of the victims of the purges , Khrushchev said , " We shall root them out and kill them off to the end . " The process of rooting and killing made more room at the top for such corners as Khrushchev , and when Kossior , boss of the Ukraine , was purged in his turn , Khrushchev , in 1938 , moved into Kaganovich 's old job . Roth before and after the war , Khrushchev 's main task was " rooting out and killing off to the end " the " unreliable elements " in the Ukraine . He performed the task with his usual gusto . " We shall destroy like roaches , " he announced in 1939 , " all filthy spies sent to the Ukraine by foreign intelligence agencies . " Estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many thousands , including virtually the entire Communist Party apparatus . After the war , during which the Ukraine had at first welcomed the invaders as liberators . Khrushchev began " rooting and killing " with redoubled vigor , Even so , in 1947 , he ran into trouble , when something like mass resistance broke out in the Ukraine . Stalin abruptly removed Khrushchev  --  almost always the prelude to extinction in those days  --  and sent the old master rooter-and-killer , Kaganovich , to replace him . After sonic months , Khrushchev suddenly popped back again , as boss of the Ukraine , and Kaganovich returned to Moscow . There is no doubt that Kaganovich had saved Khrushchev 's bacon . Khrushchev again followed Kaganovich to Moscow , in 1949 , and began to climb rapidly through the party hierarchy , building a political machine for himself and stalling it largely with former dependents from the Ukrainian days . By the time of Stalin 's death , in 1953 , Khrushchev had already passed his old mentor , Kaganovich , and ranked above him as No. 4 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated Beria . When Charles Bohlen , our former ambassador to the Soviet Union , was asked at the time of Stalin 's death who would succeed him , he answered facetiously that the only way to tell was to station yourself outside the Kremlin and count the bodies as they were hurled out the windows . There were four main contenders , he said  --  Malenkov , Molotov , Berta and Khrushchev . After you had counted the first three bodies , you could be sure that the one who was left was Stalin 's successor . It is not necessary to recount here he , * Bohlen 's facetious prediction has come figuratively true . Beria was the first to goy of course ; and then , last July , Molotov , Malenkov and that old saver of Khrushchcv 's bacon , Kaganovich . These were followed in October by still another saver of Khrushchev 's bacon  --  Marshal Georg Zhukov . For there is no doubt at all that only Zhukov 's active intervention saved Khrushchev from being brought down in disgrace during the July crisis . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvers which have left Khrushchev on top  --  at least for the time being  --  with all his rivals dead or destroyed . But it is a mistake  --  as the inner history of the Hitler years suggests  --  to disregard the part played by the human factor , behind the coldly monolithic facade of a closed society . Like Khrushchev . the victims of his power drive  --  with the possible exception of Zhukovhave been devout believers in the morality of " who ... whom ? " Yet they arc also human beings , as no one who has seen them at close range at the incredible Moscow parties can doubt . And it is reasonable to suppose that , like most of the outside world , they suffered from a hu . man tendency to underestimate the jolly , outspoken little Nikita Khrushchev , Even in the days when Khrushchev was the acknowledged first among equals , Khrushchev 's colleagues  --  Malenkov and Molotov especially  --  quite freely described him , before foreigners , as " redo ' . twiny . " The word means something between " undignified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtones of contempt . And there was good reason why such solemn , earnest men as Malenkov and Molotov might feel contempt for their bouncy little rival . Any group of human beings  --  especially those isolated from normal human contacts , like a class in a boys ' boarding school  --  is likely to have its court jester , its dispenser of comic relief . That is certainly the rote Khrushchev played , especially in Stalin 's day . Khrushchev himself has described Stalin 's custom of ordering him , at the grimly convivial Kremlin panics the dictator liked capriciously to convoke : " Nikita , dance the Gapak . " And Nikita , grinning and sweating , would obediently dance the Ukrainian peasant dance , arms folded and heavy body bouncing about , while Stalin and his sycophants laughed and clapped . In the drama , the player of the comic role never doubles as villain of the piece  --  Falstaff is not cast as lago . In life itself , calculating ruthlessness is very rarely combined with a talent for low comedy . Thus , the evidence suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underrate his drive for power , his capacity for quick and ruthless action . When Molotov , Malenkov and Kaganovich joined forces against Khrushchev last July , while Khrushchev was touring Finland , they must surely have thought that they had the " nedostoiny " little man where they wanted him at last . They had . after all , a clear majority of the votes in the Presidium . They could not foresee how Khrushchev would turn to Zhukov and the Red Army for support or how Zhukov would make available the planes of the armed forces to bring Khrushchev 's friends and supporters from the provinces to the key Central Committee meet-ing . And when , in October , Khrushchev ' secretary telephoned Zhukov in Albania . and told him that the party secretary was sending his personal plane to fetch him home to Moscow , the marshal no doubt thought that it was a nice gesture of gratitude from his jolly little friend , He never str.aseeted that he was walking straight into a trap . Thus Khrushchev has pros ed himself , so far , the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the story is not all told set . The battles khrushchiev has won bast : not heen simple struggles of skims personal risalry , though they have been that too . I or the very heart of the doctrine of " ss ho . whom ? " is that all that stands in the way of the power of the Communist Party  --  in the Sosiet state , and ultimately in all the world  --  must be destroyed . Thus in domestic terms , Khrushchev is a legitimist , a presener of the status quo . For the transformation of the Sos ict Union into a first-class industrial power , which has been Communism 's triumph , has also created dangerous new challenges to the power of the Communist Party . The purpose of Khrushchev 's industrial reorganization has been to deal with one such challenge  --  the increasing passer of the great new bureaucratic-industrial class . Khrushchev 's scheme provides for the fragmentation of the new class , on the pnriciple of divide and rule . Khrushches 's triumph oser the new class was copper-riseted by the purge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialists in the Kremlin hierarchy . The purge of Zhukov represents another response to another challenge . Certainly the marshal 's astonishingly indiscreet speech in Leningrad , in which he called for a " purge of the purgers , " was not-vserlooked by Khrushches , that old rooter-and-killer . But the basic cause of Zhukos 's dow nfall w as certainly his overt ammpt to eliminate the party 's control of the military . 1 et such challenges to the party 's power base not been eradicated . They have merely been stilled . And in one way at least , Khrushchev must be hated as not even Stalin was hated . For there is something peculiarly hate-inspiring in the triumph of a man you have underestimated , and it must be agonizingly galling to Malty still-powerful men in the upper reaches of the Soviet system to see the " neihwoiny- little man riding so high , and at their expense . Moreover , Stalin 's road  --  the road of total terror  --  is , if not closed to Khrushchev , at least infinitely perilous . Stalin used terror to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khrushches ! mist deal ss oh a nation fully industrialized , tilled with educated and able men conscious of their power . It is easy to whip a cowed and famished hound dog . It is dangerous to whip a full-grown , hungry tiger . 1 et this remarkable man has demonstrated an astonishing capacity for survival , and it is only prudent to assume that somehow he w ill whip or seduce his tiger , and emerge as the . unchallenged master of the Sets let empire . What is the meaning of Khrushchev 's mastery to us in the West ? Here again , my brother 's fresh impressions of the man arc worth recalling . " The contrast was very marked between the way he discussed the strengths and purposes of the West , on the one hand , and the West 's weakness and vulnerable points on the other . I judge that he seriously underestimates Western strength  --  although that ring of air bases bothers him terribly . I am sure he altogether misunderstands Western purposes . On this topic he was ridiculous , yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our war preparations , and so on . On the West 's weaknesses , however , he was downright brilliant . All the while , when he discussed the Middle East , one could see the idea at the back of his mind that the Western alliance would he all but crippled by oil nationalization . He was remarkably perceptive on the possibility that our allies may end by thinking that our bases on their soil merely make them 11-bomb targets . Behind the gobbledygook , in short , one sass the sharp little eyes tracing the jugular , noting the he of the windpipe , estimating the placement of the heart . " And if you think about it , a Soviet ruler who does not understand Western strength , altogether misunderstands Western purposes , and only too clearly understands Western weakness , can prove to be a very dangerous fellow indeed . " Khrushchev himself summed up his plans for the Western world all too adequately when , in a bibulous moment , at a party in November , 1956 , Khrushchev 's insults became intolerable and the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it or not , history is on our side ! " Khrushchev shouted at their departing hacks . " We will bury you ! " There were later diplomatic denials that Khrushchev had said this . But he said it all the same  --  Ambassador Bohlen , who speaks excellent Russian , heard it all too clearly . And Khrushchev undoubtedly meant what he said . No man can be entirely known to others , certainly no man who has lived his life in the secret jungle of Soviet power politics . But , as the poet John Donne wrote , " No man is an Island , entire of itself , " and we know with rea ? sonable assurance certain characteristics of the real Khrushchev behind the comic facade . We know , for example , that Khrushchev is an immensely able man , with extraordinary drive and energy , and a born gambler . We know that he is genuinely fascinated by the arts of war . We know that his morality has nothing in common with our morality  --  that he . trayal and sudden death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is in his lexicon no such word as " friendship " ? that he who befriends him , as witness Kaganovich and Zhukov , is by that fact a candidate for destruction . We know that his view of the world outside his own is distorted by a doctrine which insists that his world must inevitably triumph over ours . Beyond that , we can not probe more deeply into the human artichoke . We do not know , for example , whether Khrushchev 's gambling instincts , the pressures of his internal situation , and the ternble weapons he now has to hand , will impel him to hurry on the " inevitable " process in such a way as to risk the destruction of civilization as we have known it . But surely we know enough of this small , smiling , seemingly rather ordinary man to as aid the mistake so many of his rivals hase made , the mistake of underestimating him . That mistake could be , in the most literal sense of the word , fatal .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
