Seville 's hard-shelled Cardinal Segura , who has repeatedly attacked such freedom of worship as is granted to Spain 's 20,000-odd Protestants , is equally persistent in his opposition to Caudillo Franco 's Fascist party , the Falange . His reason : he believes that both Protestants and Falangists are a threat to Roman Catholicism . The latest bulletin of his archdiocese , out last week , contained a letter forbidding seminarians to attend the Falange 's summer youth camps . The atmosphere there , said the cardinal , " is full of perils for the formation of the conscience of a future priest . " <P> A few days before , Cardinal Segura sent his flock a pastoral letter deploring the semi-religious ceremonies which the Falange conducts in each Spanish town around the " Cross of the Fallen , " ubiquitous local memorials to Spain 's civil war dead . These invariably end with local Falange leaders crying out : " Those fallen for God and Spain ? " - and with the crowds answering : " Present ! " * <P> Wrote the cardinal : " Naziism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its errors in the cult of the dead . . . Now Divine Providence has eliminated the roots of evil with the annihilation of Naziism , yet some countries-including our own-still preserve practices of Nazi origin , such as the cult of the dead , without discrimination of religious belief , or ... the cult of the Cross of the Fallen , before which cold political homage is rendered . . . The cause has gone , but we go on breathing a pagan , Nazi atmosphere . " <P> <P> *A similar custom is still observed in the French army . La Tour d'Auvergne was a grenadier captain of such legendary courage that his superiors gave him the title of " First Grenadier of France . " Ever since his death in battle , at Oberhausen in 1800 , his name has been called at formal musters of his old regiment . Each time , a noncommissioned officer steps up to answer : " Dead on the field of honor . "                  @ @ @
