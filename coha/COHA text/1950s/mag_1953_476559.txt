MANY roads lead to limbo , but the same needs send travelers down them . The basic necessity which has formed the underworld and kept it populous is the human need for other humans ; the pressing desire , present in us all , for acceptance , approval , admiration ; the need to belong somewhere ; the desire for social status . The underworld is a society of outcasts in rebellion against its parent social order . A prison mirrors this society in miniature . The first time that I became aware of the prison world in anything resembling these terms was when a fellow called Little Mack put a convincer to me . A convincer , in underworld parlance , is an irrefutable argument . Mack was a friend who asked me for a dangerous favor for someone I disliked . " Ail , go ahead , kid , " he said . Then he added , as you might say that someone is a superior citizen of impeccable character : " After all , the guy 's a thief . " What he really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that thieves are superior people , and that I owed an allegiance to my peers which in some respects transcended my own feelings and even my welfare . The shock , actually more a start of recognition , was by no means an unpleasant one , for the idea that other thieves owed me a similar obligation was implicit in the remark . I was a rebel , feared and outcast , full of aloneness . Here was a society which offered to take me in . The occasion did not spring up full-blown . During the course of a rigorous conditioning of about a year and a half in one of the roughest prisons in the East , I had come to identify myself with characters ( members of the underworld ) , as versus the sex offenders , swindlers , wife-killers , chicken-thieves , pimps , and so forth who made up the remainder of the prison population . But mine was a defiant , half-apologetic feeling rather than one of proud fellowship . This was the first time that a realization of the superior moral position assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes in which my early training had wrapped my perceptions . Now I could reject , in righteousness , standards whose validity I had not seriously questioned . I embraced the opportunity with an alacrity fitting to a scion of generations of Christian moralists , and quickly rid myself of an oppressive weight of uncertainty . ALTHOUGH I date my entry into the underworld as a dues-paying member from this incident , I had been part of the culture in everything but awareness for some time . My initiation began when I was a fresh fish . It is an underworld axiom that only suckers go to prison , and the title conferred upon newly arrived prisoners reflects this belief . I entered the prison as fresh a fish as fish can be , a small-town boy of middle-class antecedents who lacked the social advantages which go with a conventional reform-school education , standard equipment in those who for the most part made up the piscine contingent of my age and criminal inclinations in the early nineteen-thirties . I was nineteen and had committed a haphazard robbery . The initial step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my crime automatically gave me a certain social standing , although I did not then think in such terms . I noticed only that I made some friends . Later , I perceived that their offenses , like mine , fell within the category of underworld occupations , and that , speaking generally , inmates committed for other types of crime occupied an inferior position on the prison social ladder . Evidence that I had one friend came before I had been in the place more than a couple of hours . In this prison , radios and newspapers were not permitted . News of the outside world was scarce , and the Striped-Ass Press , as we called what the newspapers call the prison grapevine , therefore functioned with an exceptional efficiency . One line , comprising a half-dozen units of inmate jobholders. ran directly from the Bertillon Room , where fish were measured , weighed , mugged ( photographed ) , and printed . Another ran from the Parole Room , where convict clerks filled out social and criminal histories on printed forms . Others tapped the warden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moral Director in our joint , and the office presided over by a ward-leader 's brother-in-law who had forsaken the plumbing trade to become our classification hack ; that is , the guard who shuffled through our folders and decided what species of fish each of us belonged to and in which tank we could he handled to the best advantage of the administration . News about new arrivals found its way from these offices to every part of the prison with remarkable celerity . I had barely been assigned to a cell in Isolation ? a range or tier of cells where fish were kept on ice ( in solitary confinement ) pending classification ? when a guard , accompanied by an inmate clerk , threw open my blind door ( a solid wooden door hinged outside the barred cell door ) . The prisoner , a middle-aged fellow whose graying shock and beetling eyebrows made him resemble the porcupine in " Pogo , - thrust a pair of hand towels , a tin cup , two tin pans , a cardboard container of chalk dust which 1 later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yellow soap , a comb , and a shaving mirror through the bars . " Wash them towels , kid , " he advised me . " They 're stiff when they 're new . " When I shook the towels out , after they had gone , a bag of Bull Durham , a book of cigarette papers , and some matches which had been halved lengthwise and tied into a bundle around a strip of abrasive from a match box fell out . Smoking was not permitted in Isolation . I do n't remember how I accounted for this largesse . The chances are that I did not waste much time in speculation . So many things had happened to me in such a short space of time that I had given up seeking explanations . I learned later that the gift had come from the fellow who had passed it to me . I looked so woebegone that he had felt sorry for me , and the grapevine news which had preceded me to Isolation had led him to believe that I would not finger ( betray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , I was caught the same day . Following our evening repast of bean-water and bread ? a feast that appeared on the official became one of the mob , or clique ( we pronounced it click ) to which my cellmates belonged . Our mob consisted of eight or ten young fellows in their twenties , all holdup men , almost all of Irish extraction , all but me from the same city neighborhood . Those of us who locked on the same block sat together in the mess hall . We exercised together , played on the same handball court , and had our own softball team . The prison mob has a dual economy . It is an exclusive interest group , and it provides its individual members with a means of surviving in a ferocious milieu . Underworld mores prohibit the acceptance of police or , in prison . administration protection . A man stands on his own feet . If he has trouble with other prisoners , as is almost inevitable in the tense hate- and fear-charged atmosphere , he . handles it himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation gets out of hand ? if he is ganged up on or sneaked up on ? his mob will take the matter up . If he has no money or goes to punishment , ' his mob will chip in tobacco , fruit , and such other luxuries as the place affords . If he has no job , the members of his mob will be on the lookout for an opening . If someone rats , or informs against him , and he is ready to apply for parole , or is put out of circulation ( sent to punishment ) , or for another reason is unable to handle the matter himself , his mob often will settle his account with the fink ( informer ) . N N INCIDENT of this kind which took place not long after I had been accepted by my mob further cemented the closest and most satisfactory social relationship that I had ever had . The enthusiastic naivete with which I celebrated my new status caused my trouble . Unless I had been warned specifically , I considered practically everyone but rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right . I burned to repay some of the indebtedness which I had incurred by doing some good guy a favor . One of my cellmates had a particularly desirable job in the prison shoe shop .. A newcomer , who later became known as Rat Sweeney ? a monicker which he still carries ? worked in the same shop and coveted my friend 's job , although we did not suspect it . This fellow made it his business to cultivatean acquaintance with me . One day , when my partners were in the shower room , he appeared at our door just before we were to line up for mess and held out a pair of shoes which he said he had clouted ( stolen ) from the stock room for a friend . He wanted me to hold them until the exercise period , he said , since he feared that they would be missed and his cell would be searched . I complied , of course . But after he had gone , it occurred to me that since my celImate worked in the same shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shoe under each armpit , gave them to another fellow a couple of cells away to hold , and thought no more about it . When we returned from mess , we found our cell a shambles . Our mattresses had been ripped open and the straw strewn over the floor , our table overturned , our bookcase emptied , our cabinet torn off the wall . The shakedown squad ( a detail of guards which searched the prison for contraband ) had paid its a visit -- we could not imagine why , until Dick was hustled to the warden 's office and charged with stealing a pair of shoes . Since the shoes had not been found and because the shop boss interceded , he beat the rap . Meanwhile I had discovered that Sweeney 's cell had not been disturbed , and a ray of light penetrated my almost impervious skull . When Sweeney appeared with an innocent face to claim his shoes , I reached out , got him by the hair , and knocked his head against the bars . Out to the Hole I went again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the hospital from the effects of a beating he had absorbed when some persons unknown threw a blanket over his head in the shower room . Shortly thereafter , Dick got me the clerk 's job in his shop , where I met Little Mack . Excepting that my loyalties were to individuals and took little account of social classes , I was already a full-fledged member of the culture . INEVITABLY , I had a number of unpleasant experiences before I learned dis-crimination , or a degree of discrimina-tion . A blend of na ? vet ? and recklessness , of which I did not succeed in ridding myself for years . periodically plunged me into hot water . Every so often , I found myself taking tin with someone who turned out to be more plausible than trustworthy . Trustworthiness , which is what rightness amounts to , essential to the survival of any revolutionary group , is of course the most potent of the factors which figure in the determination of social status in the prison world . Rightness , or a simulation of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities like reliability , organizing ability , political influence , wealth , occupation , professional standing , and " personality " come into play . It is not entirely correct to think of the prison underworld as an accurate reflection of the underworld at large . Status in the two groups rarely coincides , for the blind and savage authoritarianism which is a fundamental condition of prison life sets a value upon such traits of character as intransigence , courage , reliability , generosity , and the ability to absorb punishment without crying , or complaining , beyond that which is attached to them in the less stark and primitive setting of the outside underworld , and lessens that of other factors which contribute to social standing . Given rightness , the ability to stand up against unremitting pressures in the absence of the customary props and safeguards is the chief determinant of status in the prison order . At the time of the episode of the shoes , I saw rightness and wrongness pretty much in terms of black and white . In the course of time , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are numerous gradations of rightness , wrongness , and legitimateness . Unprincipled creeps of Sweeney 's stamp crawl beneath contempt at the very bottom of the pile , flank to flank with the ham-sandwich coppers , as we called informers paid for treachery in special food and other favors . There are other types of untrustworthy prisoner , but none so lacking in status ? primarily , I suppose , because the capacity of the individual to endanger the group largely determines degrees of wrongness . For example , a number of the ham-sandwich contingent in our prison were thieves who , pretending rightness , had full status , and so were capable of serious treacheries , such as turning up escape plans ? prison breach was punishable by doubling the original sentence . Every so often , one would be found out , occasionally at the cost of his life . On the otherhand , little onus attached to Dingbat , a good-humored imbecile who would tell the guards anything he knew , technically wrong though he was . His failing posed no menace because everyone knew about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know better . Wrong legit guys ? incidental or sexually malk adjusted offenders who identified themselves with authority ? were strung along the range of wrongness between Sweeney and his kind and Dingbat . Their activities constituted only a minor threat , since their legitimate orientation and the nature of their crimes ? the underworld regards with contempt nonprofessional types of crime ? severely limited their social contacts . Legitimate prisoners who subscribe to the conventional morality , and behave accordingly , occupy a position midway between the wrong group and the right , on the principle , seemingly , that straightforwardness deserves respect . For reasons which I am not prepared to isolate , most Negro prisoners , whose cultural background is in many respects unique in our society , fall into either the legit or wrong categories . The standards which determine status vary somewhat between prisons . They are more stringent in prisons Where discipline is harsh and the right group is comparatively large . This group sets and enforces the standards in addition to providing leadership of other kinds . Its elite is predominately composed of heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe-workers , - but usually contains a sprinkling of prisoners without outside underworld experience who have similar attitudes . toward vested authority . Heavy thieves are standard-setters because they comprise the strongest and most implacable rebel group which our culture has produced , the Communist party included . Our society recognizes this by such tokens as Alcatraz ? a pure projection of the guilt-induced anxiety which is righteousness in its elemental form ? and the punishments it metes out to heavy offenders , which generally are more severe than those imposed for murder and treason . The nature of the heavy professions and the ability of the group to survive are sufficient indications of the strength and intelligence present there . Because the group has a proportionately larger representation , in most prisons than in the underworld outside prison , and because the THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE menu posted in the visiting room under an exotic title which I forget ? I balanced myself atop the cylinder of straw that served as a mattress , being too green . to stamp the thing flat , and drifted swiftly off to San Francisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so engrossed in rescuing this damsel from imaginary perils that I failed to hear the night hack creeping up the catwalk . He caught me red-handed . I spent forty-eight hours in the Hole ( a punishment dungeon ) for smoking , and another seventy-two for refusing to say where I had obtained the contraband . I T wooer. be hard to overestimate the importance of this episode in terms of my social progress . It chanced that several of the elite of the prison were sojourning in the Hole at the time of my visit . We became acquainted . They liked me for accepting punishment instead of buying my way off at the expense of someone else ? an unreasoned reaction on my part , but one which jibed with the most important tenet of the underworld morality . I liked them because I gathered that they felt as I did about a number of things , chief among them authority , and I began to perceive that I was not alone in the world . However my behavior might seem to belie it , my standards for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable family . Although I strove to pretend otherwise , I believed that I was worthless , hopeless , . someone apart ? years were to pass before I accumulated the knowledge to account for my off-beat attitudes . Beneath my defensive callus of belligerence , I was filled with feelings of guilt and inadequacy . I more than half believed that I was crazy . In addition to reassuring me somewhat and procuring the good will of some of the men who set the standards in the prison , my trip to the Hole gained me an official disfavor which proved to be nearly as useful a social asset . The guards began to ride me when I returned to Isolation . If guards dislike you , prisoners of any worth are sure to cotton to you . I quickly acquired a certain prestige among other fish . Those of my own rebellious persuasion made a point of being friendly when we met in the shower room , in the inoculation line , or outside the offices of ? the various functionaries who had us led out from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or would be . The others treated me gingerly , fearing to be classed as Bolsheviks by association . Naturally , I leaned toward those who leaned towards me . In this fashion , I began to draw a line between those who were of the underworld and those who were not , and to identify myself with those who were . Convict society has three levels . At the top are the " right " guys ? those who regulate their lives by the distinctive underworld morality . Usually , but not always , they are professional criminals . Then come " legit " prisoners ? average citizens who for one reason or another have run afoul of the law : embezzlers , wife-killers , rapists , and the like . At the bottom of the social scale are " wrong " convicts , the creeps ? prisoners who violate the code to which they pay lip service . Rightness entails resistance to authority in any vested form . The legit viewpoint is precisely that of the average citizen . Wrongness implies lack of respect for any principle save that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my right friends , most of whom were men of considerable character . III 0 NE of the fellows I had met in the Hole had been returned to his cell-block the same day that I got out and had sent me some tobacco and candy through my original benefactor , now a fast friend who managed to stop at my door several times a day to exchange a few words . Shortly before it came time for me to leave for the block where I was to live for the next five years , this fellow sent up word that I had been classified in Grade B , but that he was seeing what could be done about it . Grade B prisoners were the second-class citizens of the place . They locked , or lived , on a special tier , under guards picked for their toughness , ate in their cells , and , except that they were permitted to exercise with the general population , were denied most of the few privileges that the prison afforded . I heard no more about my fate until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I found that I was listed for one of the most desirable blocks in the institution . My friend 's account of how the transfer had been accomplished advanced my education another step . He had gone to his partner , who worked as a clerk in the Classification Room . His partner had tried to persuade the guard in charge to change my classification . Failing , he had typed out seven copies of my transfer order instead of the customary six . The top order consigned me to the B range . The others scheduled me for a desirable block . The guard had glanced at the first order and signed them all . The clerk destroyed the first order . Then he went to a friend of his who worked in the warden 's office and prevailed upon him to remove my card from the files and substitute another upon which no record of my breach of discipline appeared . This was possible because I was too new to be known to the officials except by number . To this day , my initial sojourn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who took part in this transaction felt the slightest qualm of conscience . The state and its representatives were the common enemy . All 's fair in war . I should add that if I had been able to offer cigarettes or some other form of payment , and had done so , the offer would have been regarded as an insult . Coppers , legit guys , and creeps may and should be paid . Right guys can not be bought . They do favors for other right guys , and are repaid in like coin if an opportunity arises . M I. INCIPIENT rightness continued to work minor miracles . The prison was badly overcrowded . Three were lock- ing , or living , in cells intended for one . A cell to oneself was one of the most sought-after privileges in the prison . Next to that , men preferred to lock with but one partner . We all were living the unnatural lives of caged animals . Consequently , we were an unstable lot . Fist fights and knifings in the cells were frequent . Cooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends wore on each other 's nerves . To complicate the situation , each cell block was a prison within a prison . Subject to a few general regulations , the block guards ran their sections pretty much as they pleased . The block to which my friend had caused me to be assigned was considered good because the sergeant in charge was an old-timer who , as the prisoners put it , had pulled more time in the joint than most of the cons . He knew what we were up against . For his part , he wanted only to get his day in with a minimum of trouble and collect his pay . He knew which of his charges were likely to cause him trouble , and he made it his business to keep these men as happy as might be . My arrival posed a problem , for he had no single cells and only three which had but two occupants . Two young Irish holdup men occupied one . A couple of prison politicians who worked in the administration office shared another . The Gump Brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent most of their lives in the place for stealing horses and chickens , inhabited the third . The guard did not wish to offend the first pair and feared to affront the second , who would not have hesitated to carry tales to the front office about him , so he put me in with the dirty , ignorant , querulous , and half-crazy Gumps ( in the lingo , a gump is a chicken ) . They were out at work at the time , but the cell stank and crawled with vermin . I endured the place for about half an hour , then knocked on the bars with my tin cup . When the guard came clown , I told him to take me out of there . He demurred . I lost my temper . We were discussing the issue at the top of our lungs when the men returned to the block from work . He had taken out his pad and begun to write me up ( prefer charges against me ) for insubordination , which meant a prolonged visit to the Hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took him aside . He returned in a moment , much calmer , and after warning me that I must do as I was told if I wanted to get along with him , he moved me in with the Irish boys . It was at their request , I learned . They had been told by one of my Hole companions that I was moving on the block and had been asked to look after me until I got my bearings . t T HEIR cell was as shabbily homelike as the caboose of a long-haul freight . It con- tained a well-filled bookcase and a wall cabinet stocked with tobacco , cakes , and candy . They told me to consider everything in the cell my own . When I warned them that I had no money and no prospects of getting any , since I was not in touch with anyone outside , they asked , " So what ? " I said I wanted them to understand that I did n't know when I 'd be able to repay them . " So what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next couple of weeks I exigencies of prison life place a premium upon the traits it values most , heavy standards have a greater effect in forming the ideals of the prison underworld than in setting those of the underworld at large . A legitimate prisoner who exhibits such traits may well acquire a position in the prison order superior to that accorded a big shot from the outside underworld who does not show them , or exhibits them to a lesser degree . ONE of several such instances in our setup involved Al Capone and a fellow named Henry Ackerman . Ackerman was a business man of great wealth who had killed someone while driving drunk . Capone 's organizational genius , ruthlessness , wealth , and political power had raised him to the top of the outside underworld . If he and Ackerman ' had been men of equal character , Capone 's prestige would have been by far the higher . .. But Ackerman pulled his time like most of the rest of us . He wore prison issue clothes and shoes , ate main-line garbage ( mess-hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refused all the special privileges which indubitably were within his reach . Capone carried no tales either , but he was on back-slapping terms with guards and higher officials , slept in silk pajamas on a cot with springs fitted with a real mattress , enjoyed such other exotic privileges as his own icebox , crammed with good outside food , and entertained visitors of both sexes privately . His standing also suffered because of his occupation , which presupposes cordial relations with police , who are detested by heavy thieves . Ackerman 's standing on the prison social scale was higher than Capone 's . Some years after his departure from us , Capone had the ill luck to spend some time in Alcatraz , which , being populated almost 100 per cent by elite heavy thieves , has the most unyielding standards in the American underworld . Here , he had no status at all . No one made friends with him . No one accepted the proffered loan of his magazines . No one passed him a civil word . Once , he tried throwing his weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma , who promptly beat him over the head with a broom . The great mobster became timid and morose and gradually withdrew into himself . He had been in bad mental condition for a couple of years when the time came for his release , I have been told . It takes a resolute man , full of bitter pride , to live shut off from his fellows by their disapproval . I have wondered sometimes how long it would have been before I took refuge in a make-believe world , if I had n't gone to prison .
