For a while it seemed as if Manhattan balletomanes might not get a look at the Sadler 's Wells Theatre Ballet , the junior of Britain 's two Sadler 's Wells companies . With the Metropolitan and City operas in full swing , Impresario Sol Hurok had to search high &; low to find a theater . But last week , in a Broadway movie house , New Yorkers were making up their minds about the company that in the past six months has been a popular hit in the rest of the U.S. and Canada . <P> Like thousands of fans in Toronto , Vancouver , San Francisco and New Orleans , <P> New Yorkers found Pineapple Poll , a kind of English Gaite Parisienne , the biggest hit of the company 's 16 ballets , and the one that best fits the company 's youthful talents . Unlike the senior Sadler 's Wells , whose virtuosity is in classic ballet , the juniors do better in comic and contemporary works . Compared with George Balanchine 's brilliant new Swan Lake for the New York City Ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointing series of divertissements . <P> Technically , the dancing was almost always good , but it was seldom exciting . Australian-born Elaine Fifield , sometimes touted as the heiress apparent to the senior ballet 's Margot Fonteyn , showed off flawless timing and technique . But at 21 she lacks the fire , brilliance and riveting personality that distinguish a prima ballerina from a principal dancer . Lithuanian-born Co-Star Svetlana Beriosova had elegance and style , but not the breathtaking precision of either Fonteyn or the New York City Ballet 's Maria Tallchief . The male dancers were strong , but none yet looked like another Eglevsky ( New York City Ballet ) or another Youskevitch ( Ballet Theatre ) . <P> If Manhattan critics were a bit reserved with their praise , Britain 's junior company had a consolation : its six-month tour has grossed close to $2,000,000.
