FESTIVAL ( 607 pp. -J . B. Priestley-Harper ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> What in the world of 1951 is a festival ? With the Festival of Britain beginning next month , Britons have been asking themselves the question and arriving at one of two opposite answers : 1 ) the festival should be mainly a show-window for the achievements of Britain under Socialism ; 2 ) it should be mainly a chance for Britons to have a little fun . <P> Novelist J. B. Priestley ( The Good Companions , Angel Pavement ) , a man who loves both the Labor Party and his pint of ale , is not exactly opposed to the first idea , but he is vehemently in favor of the second . In his sprightly new novel , Festival , he makes the point with the high glee of a sturdy toper laying about him in a temperance meeting . <P> Harridans in Cholers . Priestley sets out to tell how an average British town plays its part in the Festival of Britain , quite against its better civic judgment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore " Horace Tribe , a spurious old dear with " a piratical nose and tiny bright eyes as busy and wicked as mice . " <P> The commodore actually means as well by Farbridge as he does by himself . He needs money , the town needs a little fun . By promoting a festival , the commodore intends to see that both needs are satisfied . From there on , his task resembles , in its ticklish reconciliation of opposites , the difficulties of a con man trying to play Santa Claus . <P> The commodore 's difficulties are complicated by the shoals of odd fish that abound in even so small a puddle as Farbridge . There are " fierce , gay anarchists , " mothers of prodigies , blustering M.P.s , professional yokels , degenerate nobility , gumshoes in broom closets , harridans in cholers , blond giants with Chinese grandmothers , hard-faced Communists who gnaw rock-cakes at their meetings ; in all , as fair a mess of stage Englishmen as have recently been caught in one volume . <P> Commodore in Arms . One Farbrigian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , screeches at the commodore : " You 'd better stop mountebanking round this town and clear out as soon as you can . . . There wo n't be a festival here . . . That 's all . " Another leading citizen d'gs into the commodore 's naval record , finds it a sorry mess , and tries to bullyrag the old boy out of town . <P> But the commodore sticks to his guns , even though they are n't loaded ; Farbridge has its festival , a merry one indeed , and the former naval person devolves into the arms of a wealthy , amiable semi-lunatic . All of which , says the book 's jacket , " proves that life 's worth living . " The evidence may be a bit thin for the claim , but the book does demonstrate again that Author Priestley is a good judge of characters if not of character , and unquestionably one of the most fluent , enthusiastic word-jobbers in the language .                @ @ @ @ @
