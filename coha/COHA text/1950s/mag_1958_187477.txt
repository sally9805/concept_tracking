" This pregnancy is no different from my others , " said the Oklahoma housewife mildly . Physicians had indeed found that their 27-year-old patient had just about all the obvious signs of a four-month pregnancy . What flabbergasted them was the knowledge that two years before , she had undergone a hysterectomy , and thus could not possibly have conceived . <P> Last week the University of Oklahoma Hospitals reported that rarely in medical annals has the poignant phenomenon of false **31;6065;TOOLONG such odds of matter over mind . Pseudocyesis is older than Hippocrates , has affected subjects from seven to 79 . Modern medicine knows it as a mental condition , arising from emotional needs so intense that they lead to suppression of menstruation , distention of the abdomen , enlargement of the breasts , and morning nausea . Most cases involve psychotic women with a feeble grasp of reality . But this patient was not psychotic . Her perceptions were normal ; she knew all along that the operation had barred her from reproduction . <P> Maternity Clothes . Her trouble , as the physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a whole woman . " At 13 , she developed chronic diabetes . After her first marriage at 18 , diabetes complicated the birth of her only child , who was delivered by Caesarean section . Married again at 19 , the girl insisted on a second pregnancy against the wishes of both her physician and new husband . The result was a stillborn delivery in the fourth month , followed by the hysterectomy . <P> Depressed after the operation , she tried vainly to adopt a second child . She lost interest in housework , devoted hours to playing with her daughter , sometimes reversing their roles . When her husband became interested in a more mature woman , she quickly seized upon pregnancy as the only means of keeping her home and selfesteem . Last year she developed all the symptoms of pseudocyesis , including the same sharp decrease in the insulin required to control her diabetes that she had experienced in her real pregnancies . <P> Labor Pains . She readily consented to psychiatric treatment at a University of Oklahoma hospital . Physicians found her responsive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subsist on only six insulin units per day against her normal daily dosage of 30 to 40 . After only five weeks of treatment , she appeared fully prepared mentally to end her strange charade . The only question seemed to be how to do it without social embarrassment . Her solution : she returned to the hospital in ordinary clothes after a weekend pass , told fellow patients that she had aborted spontaneously while at home . <P> Yet the symptoms of false pregnancy stayed on . Three weeks later , still in the hospital , she awoke with severe " labor pains . " Not until the " labor pains " had continued for 24 hours did her " pregnancy " finally end , five months after it began . Next day her insulin need promptly rose . At last she gave away her maternity clothes and went home , where she is now living with her husband and child .
