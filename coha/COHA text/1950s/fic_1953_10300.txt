a little pep talk about less lavatory art in the future , please . " " What ? " said Mr. Delahanty in a strong voice . " John , please try just to listen . I do n't know why the school does what it does or why Cress calls things by the names she uses . All I want to do is tell you what hap-pened . " " O.K. , " Mr. Delahanty said , " I 'm listening . Tell me . " He had the look of a man who has not yet had his say out but Mrs. Delahanty went on in spite of it . " On his way out Mr. DuMont stumbled over a pair of tennis shoes somebody had left on the stage . He stooped , picked them up by the strings , swung them back and forth , and then said in what Cress reports as being a perfectly dead-pan , side-splitting way : I see Delahanty has been here .

" " I thought you approved of craziness . I thought that was what we 've been arguing about . " " Gertrude , I have n't been arguing and what I approvep101of is not craziness but freedom to find out who and what you are . " " Well , Cress thinks she 's found out . She thinks she 's a wit . Or a wag . Or the school jester . She says that about Delahanty 's Law really panicked them and that not an eye in the auditorium but was on her .

Well , when she finished , I told her everything I 've been thinking . I told her to stop it at once . That it was cheap and silly to play to the grandstand that way and that she was going to regret getting a reputation as a hare-brained clown when she was really a good , sweet , solid , sensible child . " Mrs. Delahanty was unable to keep her voice from trembling . " What did Cress say ? " " She said , Good , solid , sensible , sweet , ' as if I had  --  as if I had reviled her . She said child ' as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . " Mr. Delahanty nodded and nodded as if this were all an old story to him.  | " Then she stopped crying long enough to say that I did n't understand a thing . Not her . Not school . Not young people in general . Not Mr. DuMont . Not I. Marcum . And she said her constant prayer was that when she grew up and had children that she would not forget what it was like to be young . The way I have . And she said that for three months at school she had been sweet , solid , and sensible . And where had it gotten her ? At the end of three months of that , she had been a complete nonentity and not a soul at school could 've told you who Crescent Delahantywas . And now at the end of three weeks of planned living , with craziness for her trademark , she is a great success and she doubts there is even a custodian at school who has not heard of Crescent Delahanty and Delahanty 's Law . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . ' She said yes , she was , and proud of it . Then she went to her room . But before she left she said , Anyway my father understandsme . ' And now she is in there making a list headed , What 's Wrong with Mother . ' But I do n't care . I had to tell her . " Mr. Delahanty caught at the edge of Mrs. Delahanty 's skirt as she switched away from the fire and toward him , and pulled her down onto his lap . " Do n't try to comfort me , " she said , struggling to get up . " You think one way and I think another . That 's all there is to it . " " I think just what you think , Gertrude  --  except that I think Cress will have to find it out for herself . She 'll wake up pretty soon , and it 'll be a painful awakening but it 's bound to come . "  |p103Mrs  . Delahanty , in spite of herself , was settling back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . You do n't think our daughter 's a fool , do you ? " " No , " Mrs. Delahanty said , letting her head , finally , rest at ease against her husband 's shoulder . " No , how could I ? Cress recapitulates you . " The " awakening , " as Mr. Delahanty had named it , came the first week in December . The rains which had held off through the whole of November arrived the minutethe November leaf on the calendar was torn off and made up by their abundance for their lateness . On Friday afternoon Mr. Delahanty , happily housebound by the downpour , sat before a drowsy fire working on his electrificationlists . On the other side of the fire Mrs. Delahanty was shellingEnglish walnuts preparatory to sugaring them for annualChristmas gifts to eastern relatives . She listened to the pleasant blend of sounds , fire sighing , pen scratching , nut shells cracking , and behind and giving body to the blend the fine heavy sound of the constant rain . She was , she thought , reasonably happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crock on the floor by her side , she decided that there is no such thing as reasonable happinesssince happiness , like love , is without reason . A reasonablehappiness is usually simply all the reasons one can think of for not being unhappy . " I am not unhappy because my family is in good healthp104and I myself am well , and a good and needed rain is fallingand we have a tight roof over our heads and the fire is drawing beautifully . " No , she thought , that is not enough . Happiness , like love , fills the heart and does not need to be accounted for . Joy washes away knowledge of numbers . The one , two , threes . That was why , she supposed , John 's lists had offended her . If you could analyze , you were not in love . Or at least she was not . She was analyzingnow . That was the reason she knew she was not happy . And continuing to analyze she knew she would not be until Cress was herself once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delahanty recognized this fact ; but she was neither the old Cress , solid and sensible , nor the new one , crazy and show-off . This Cress had been crying . She had on a hooded raincoat but she had walked up from the bus with the hood hanging down her shoulders and her hair , soaked to the scalp , was lank and mousey . She was no ice blonde now . I. Marcum would scarcely recognize her . Water dripped from her cheeks and beaded her eyelashes and stood in the corners of her mouth which she held with unchild-like firmness . She went without a word to the fireplace and stood there with her back to her parents while occasional drops of water hissed off her raincoat onto the andirons . Then she turned around to face them , and it was the first time Mrs. Delahanty had ever heard adult resignation in her daughter 's voice , adult acceptance of the fact that the source of one 's joy is also often the source of one 's sorrow . I may have forgottenp105what it 's like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it 's like to be a parent . " You have a perfect right to say I told you so now if you want to , Mother , " Cress said . " You told me I was getting to be a character and I was , all right . " " What do you mean , Cress ? " her father asked . " I mean I 'm Character , " Cress said bleakly . " I 'm ' IrresponsibleDelahanty , ' I 'm that Crazy Kid . ' If I said I was dying , people would laugh . " Water ran out of her hair and across her face and dripped off her chin , but she scorned to wipe it away . " I made a good speech to the Student Council and they laughed at every word I said . They laughed and held their sides and rolled in their chairs like loons . " " What speech was this , Cress ? " " The speech everybody who is a candidate for an office has to make to them . Then if they like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for freshman editor . What they nominated me for was Josh editor . Josh editor . A twoyear-oldcan be Josh editor . All you need to be Josh editor is a pair of scissors to cut out jokes with . I would n't be Josh editor if they shot me for not being . It 's a silly job . " " Take off your coat , Cress , " Mrs. Delahanty said , and Cress , not ceasing to speak , began also to unbutton . " I would 've been a good editor and I told them the reasons  --  like I was responsible , knew the meaning of time , would see that the assignments were in on time and so forth . They laughed like hyenas , " she said , not bitterly , but reflectively . " They said , This is the richest thing yet . Delahanty is ap106real character . ' So they nominated me for Josh editor and I 'm branded for life . " She threw her raincoat , which she had finished unbuttoning , onto the floor , said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , no longer trying to hide the fact that she was crying . Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty still held the positions they had had when Cress entered ; Mr. Delahanty , pen above his list ; Mrs. Delahanty nutcracker in one hand , cracked unshelled nut in the other . Mr. Delahanty said , " I guess you were right . I guess it would 've been better to have forbidden it . " " I did forbid it , " Mrs. Delahanty said , " in so far as I could , and you can see what came of that . " Mechanically she picked the kernel from the nut she still held , then got up and threw the pan of shells into the fire . Mr. Delahantyhad gone back to his list-making and she felt almost the first wave of dislike she had ever known for her husband . That was really carrying objectiveness a little too far . Electrification at a time like this . She herself was goingto Cress . She looked coldly down at Mr. Delahanty 's list as she passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of being written there . " Spit . Spit . Spit Delahanty . Big Spit Delahanty . Spit . Spit . " John saw her look and let her take his hand . " I told you it was a dark time , " he said quietly . " John  --  you still remember ? It still matters ? " All he said was , " You go on in to Cress . She 's your youngest baby . "  |p107She  let go his hand and went toward Cress 's room . She did n't know what she would or could say when she got there . Maybe , " Cress , people like you and your father have to try on more than one way of being and doing to see who you are . And you 're bound to make mistakes . " Maybe she would say , " My sweet sensible daughter . " But she would surely hug her and kiss her . Her arms , as she heard through the closed door those catching sobs , alreadyfelt that stocky body grow quiet . She opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p108It  was the last Thursday in January , about nine in the evening , cold and raining . The three Delahantys sat close about the living-room fireplace  --  Mr. Delahanty at the built-in desk working on his schedule , Mrs. Delahanty on the sofa reading , and between them , crosswise in the wing chair , their daughter . Cress was apparently studying the program of the folkdancefestival in which she was to appear the next evening . For the most part , however , she did not even see the program . She saw , instead , herself , infinitely graceful , moving through the figures of the dance that had been so difficult for her to master . The high school folk-dancing class was made up of two kinds of performers  --  those with natural ability , who had themselves elected the class , and those who , in the language of the physical education department , were " remedials . " The remedials had been sent into the class willynillyin an effort to counteract in them defects ranging from antisocial attitudes to what Miss Ingols , the gym teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had achieved the class under this final classification but now ,  |p109at  midterm , had so far outgrown it as to be the only remedialwith a part in the festival . The first five numbers on the program , " Tsiganotchka , " " Ladies ' Whim , " " Meitschi Putz Di , " " Hiawatha , " and " Little Man in a Fix , " Cress ignored . It was not only that she was not in these but that they were in no way as beautiful as " Road to the Isles , " in which Mary Lou Hawkins , Chrystal O'Conor , Zelma Mayberry , Bernadine Deevers , and Crescent Delahanty took part . The mere sight of her name beside that of Bernadine Deevers , Tenant High School 's most gifted dancer  --  most gifted person , really  --  instantly called up to Cress a vision of herself featly footingit in laced kirtle and starched skirts , a vision of herself dancing not only the outward steps of " Road to the Isles " but its inner meaning : what Miss Ingols had called " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was particularly adapted to dancingthat meaning because she had so recently come that way herself . If she had been given three wishes when school opened in September , two of them would have been that Bernadine be her friend and that she herself succeed in the folk-dancing class . Both had then seemed equally impossible . Now not only did she have a part in the festival but Bernadine was her dear friend and coming to spend the week end with her . At the minute the evening reached what she considered its peak of mellowness , she intended to speak to her father and mother about the festival and Bernadine 's visit . She was exceedingly uncertain about their performances on both these occasions.  |p110The  rain suddenly began to fall harder . Cress 's father , hearing it on the roof , watched with gratification as the water streamed across the dark windowpanes . " Just what the oranges have been a-thirsting for , " he said . Mrs. Delahanty closed her book . " How 's the schedule coming ? " she asked her husband . " O.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up from the festival program with embarrassment . The schedule was one of the things she wanted to speak to her father about . She hoped he would n't mention it while Bernadine was visiting them . Every winter , as work on the ranch slackened , he drew up a schedule for the better ordering of his life . And every spring , as work picked up , he abandoned it as easily as if it had never been . Last winter , he had made a plan called " A Schedule of Exercises to Ensure Absolute Fitness , " which included not only the schedule of exercises and the hours at which he proposed to practice them but a list of the weaknesses they were to counteract . He had even gone so far , last winter , as to put on a pair of peculiar short pants and run six times around the orchard without stopping , arms flailing , chest pumping  --  a very embarrassing sight , and one that Cress could not possibly have explained to Bernadine . This winter , the subject of her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a new encyclopedia set and was mapping out a reading program that would enable him , by a wise use of his spare time , to cover the entire field of human knowledge in a year . The name of the schedule , written at the top of a sheet ofp111Cress 's yellow graph paper , was , in fact , " Human Knowledgein a Year . " There was nothing about this plan that would call for embarrassing public action , like running around the orchard in shorts , but it was so incredibly naive and dreamy that Cress hoped her father would not speak of it . Bernadine was far too sophisticated for schedules . " Where are you now on your schedule , John ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . Mr. Delahanty , who liked to talk about his plans almost as much as he liked to make them , put down his pen and picked up the sheet of paper on which he had been writing . " I 've got all the subjects I want to read up about listed , and the times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do now but decide what 's the best time for what . For instance , if you were me , Gertrude , would you spend the fifteen minutes before breakfast on art ? Or on archaeology , say ? " " You do n't ever have fifteen minutes before breakfast , " Mrs. Delahanty said . Mr. Delahanty picked up his pen . " I thought you wanted to discuss this . " " Oh , I do ! " said Mrs. Delahanty . " Well , if I had fifteen minutes before breakfast , I 'd read about archaeol-ogy " " Why ? " asked Mr. Delahanty . " It 's more orderly that way , " Mrs. Delahanty said . " Orderly ? " asked Mr. Delahanty . " A-r-c , " Mrs. Delahanty spelled , " comes before a-r-t . " Mr. Delahanty made an impatient sound . " I 'm not go/ing at this alphabetically , Gertrude . Cut and dried . What I 'm thinking about is what would make the most interestingmorning reading . The most interesting and inspiring . " " Art is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If that 's what you 're after . " This seemed to decide Mr. Delahanty . " No , I think science should be the morning subject , " he said , and wrote something at the top of a sheet  --  " Science , " Cress supposed . " That 's better , " he said . " That leaves art for the evening ; when I 'll have time to read aloud to you . " " Do n't change your schedule around for my sake , John , " said Mrs. Delahanty , who hated being read to about anything . " I 'm not . All personal considerations aside , that 's a more logical arrangement . Now the question is , which art ? " This seemed to Cress the moment for which she had been waiting . " Dancing is one of the earliest and most importantof the arts , " she said quickly . " Oho ! " said her father . " I thought you were in a coma . " " I 've been rehearsing , " said Cress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , " Cress said . " So that 's what was going on  --  ' Ladies ' Whim , " Tsiga-notchka '  --  " " Father , " Cress interrupted , " I 've told you and told you the t 's silent . Why do n't you take the program and practice the names ? I 'll help you . " Cress got up and took the program across to her father.  | " Practice them , " said Mr. Delahanty with surprise , reading through the dances listed . " What do I care how they 're pronounced ? Korbushka , ' Kohanotchka , " he said , mispronouncing wildly . " I 'm not going to Russia . " " But you 're going to the folk-dance festival , " Cress reminded him . " I do n't have to go . If you do n't want  --  " " I do , Father . You know I want you to go . Only I do n't want you to mispronounce the names . " " Look , Cress , " Mr. Delahanty said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I 'm there . No one will know you have a father who ca n't pronounce . Mute I 'll come and mute I 'll go . " " I do n't want you to be mute , " Cress protested . " And even if I did , you could n't very well be mute the whole time Bernadine 's here . And Bernadine 's the star of the program . " " To Bernadine , " said Mr. Delahanty , referring to the program once again , " I shall speak of Badger , ' and The Lumberman 's Two Step . ' I can pronounce them fine and they ought to hold Bernadine . She 's not going to be here long , is she ? " " Friday to Monday , " said Mrs. Delahanty . " In that case , " said Mr. Delahanty , " maybe I should find another one . How about The Irish Jollity , ' Cress ? Do I say that all right ? " " Now , John ! " Mrs. Delahanty reproved her husband . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother.  |p144But  he must n't before Bernadine . Bernadine 's serious about dancing . She 's going to be a great artist . " " A great dancer ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " She has n't decided what kind of an artist yet , " Cress said . " Only to be great in something . " " Well , well , " said Mr. Delahanty . " I 'm beginning to look forward to meeting Bernadine . " " You already have , " Cress told him . " Bernadine was one of the girls who rode with us to the basketball game . " Mr. Delahanty squinted his eyes , as if trying to peer backward to the Friday two weeks before when he had provided Cress and four of her friends with transportation to an out-of-town game . He shook his head . " Ca n't recall any Bernadine , " he said . " She was the one in the front seat with us , " Cress reminded him . " That girl ! " exclaimed Mr. Delahanty , remembering . " But her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cress told him . " That 's what I wanted to explain to you , because tomorrow 's Friday , too . " Mr. Delahanty left desk and schedule and walked over in front of the fireplace . From this position , he could get a direct view of his daughter . " What 's this you 're saying , Cress ? " he asked . " Her name is n't Bernadine because tomorrow 's Friday . Is that what you said ? " " Yes , it is , " Cress told him , seriously . " Only it 's not just tomorrow . Her name is n't Bernadine on any Friday . "  |p115Mr  . Delahanty appealed to his wife . " Do you hear what I hear , Gertrude ? " " Mother , " Cress protested , " this is n't anything funny . In fact , it 's a complete tragedy . " " Well , Cress dear , " her mother said reasonably , " I have n't said a word . And your father 's just trying to get things straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , " Cress insistedobstinately . " Now , Cress , " Mr. Delahanty urged , " you 're jumpingto conclusions . Though I admit I think it 's queer to have a name on Fridays you do n't have the rest of the week . And I do n't see anything tragic about it . " " That 's what I 'm trying to tell you , only you keep acting as if it 's a joke . " " What is Bernadine 's name on Fridays , Cress ? " asked her mother . " Nedra , " said Cress solemnly . Mr. Delahanty snapped his fingers . " Yes , sir , " he said , " that 's it ! That 's what they called her , all right . " " Of course , " said Cress . " Everyone does on Fridays , out of respect for her sorrow . " " Just what is Bernadine 's sorrow , Cress ? " her mother asked . " Bernadine never did say  --  out and out , that is . Once in a while she tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we all know what , generally speaking , must have happened . " " What ? " asked Mr. Delahanty . " Generally speaking ? "  |p116Cress  looked at her father suspiciously , but his face was all sympathetic concern . " On some Friday in the past , " she said , " Nedra had to say no to someone . Someone she loved . " " How old is Berna  --  Nedra ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " Sixteen , " Cress said . " Almost . " " Well , it could n't have been too long ago then , could it ? " her mother suggested . " Was this person , " Mr. Delahanty ventured , " this personNedra said no to , a male ? " " Of course , " said Cress . " I told you it was a complete tragedy , did n't I ? His name was Ned . That much we know . " " Then the Nedra is in honor of  --  Ned ? " asked her mother . " In honor and loving memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , Ned died . " Mr. Delahanty said nothing . Mrs. Delahanty said , " Poor boy ! " " I think he was probably more than a boy , " Cress said . " He owned two drugstores . " After the elder Delahantys had thought about this for a while , Mr. Delahanty asked , " This no ' Bernadine  --  Nedra  --  said , was it to a proposal of marriage ? " " We do n't ever ask about that , " Cress told her fatherdisapprovingly . " It does n't seem like good taste to us . " " No , I do n't suppose it is , " Mr. Delahanty admitted . " Anyway , " Cress said , " that 's Bernadine 's tragedy andwe all respect it and her wish to be called Nedra on Fri/days . And tomorrow is a Friday , and it would be pretty awful to have her upset before the festival . " Mr. Delahanty stepped briskly back to his desk . " Do n't you worry for a second , Cress , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name is Nedra . " " Thank you , Father , " Cress said . " I knew you 'd understand . Now I 'd better go to bed . " At the door to the hallway , she turned and spoke once again . " If I were you , Father , I would n't say anything about your schedule to Bernadine . " " I had n't planned on talking to her about it . But what 's wrong with it ? " Mr. Delahanty sounded a little testy . " Oh , nothing , " Cress assured him . " I think it 's dear and sweet of you to make schedules . Only , " she explained , " it 's so idealistic . " After Cress left the room , Mr. Delahanty said , " What the hell 's wrong with being idealistic ? " Cress thought that her friend , in her costume for " Fado Blanquita , " the Spanish dance in which she performed the solo part , looked like the queen of grace and beauty . And she said so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . She was leaning out from the opened casement window of Cress 's room into the shimmering , rain-washed air . She tautened her costume 's already tight bodice , fluffed up its already bouffant skirt , and extended her hands in one of the appealing gestures of the dance toward the trees of the orange orchard upon which the window opened.  | " Is your father a shy man ? " she asked . Mr. Delahanty , who had been working near the drivewayto the house when the two girls got off the school bus an hour before , had , instead of lingering to greet them , quickly disappeared behind a row of trees . Now , in rubberboots , carrying a light spade that he was using to test the depth to which the night before 's rain had penetrated the soil , he came briefly into sight , waved his spade , and once again disappeared . " No , " said Cress , who thought her father rather bold , if anything . " He 's just busy . After the rain , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bernadine said understandingly . She moved her hands about in the placid afternoon air as if scooping up samples . " Farming is an awfully elemental life , I expect . My father "  --  Bernadine 's father , J. M. Deevers , was vice-president of the Tenant First National Bank  --  " probably does n't know one element from another . I expect your father 's rather an elemental type , too , is n't he ? Fundamentally , I mean ? " " I do n't know , Nedra , " Cress said humbly . " He 's black-haired , " Bernadine said . " It 's been my experience that black-haired men are very elemental . " She brought her expressive hands slowly down to her curving red satin bodice . " You must have a good deal of confidence in your family to let them go tonight , " she went on briskly . " Let them ! " Cress repeated , amazed at the word . " Perhaps they 're different from my family . Mine al/ways keep me on pins and needles about what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , " Cress admitted , though loyalty to her father and mother would not permit her to say how greatly they worried her . She never went anyplace with them that she was not filled with a tremulous concern lest they do or say something that would discredit them all . She stayed with them . She attempted to guide them . She hearkened to every word said to them , so that she could prompt them with the right answers . But let them ! " They always just take it for granted that where I go , they go , " she said . " There 's not much question of letting . " " Mine used to be that way , " Bernadine confided . " But after what happened at the festival last year , I put my foot down . This year , ' I told them , you 're not going . ' " " What happened last year ? " asked Cress , who had not then been a dancer . " After the program was over last year , Miss Ingols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father participated . He danced the Hopak , ' and pretty soon he was lifting Miss Ingols off the floor at every other jump . " " Oh , Nedra , " Cress said . " How terrible ! What did Ingols do ? " " Nothing , " said Bernadine . " That was the disgusting part . As a matter of fact , she seemed to enjoy it . But you can imagine how I suffered . " Cress nodded . She could . She was thinking how she would suffer if her father , in addition to mispronouncingp120all the dances , went out on the gymnasium floor and , beforeall her friends , misdanced them . " Are your parents the participating type ? " Bernadine asked . Cress nodded with sad conviction . " Father is . And Mother is if encouraged . " " You 'd better warn them right away , " Bernadine said . " Your father just came in the back door . You could warn him now . " Cress walked slowly down the hallway toward the kitchen . Before the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be jouncing Miss Ingols around , and even calling Bernadine Bernadine  --  then all would be ruined completely , all she had looked forward to for so long . In the kitchen , she noted signs of the special supper her mother was cooking because of Bernadine : the cole-slaw salad had shreds of green peppers and red apples mixed through it tonight to make it festive ; the party sherbet glasses , with their long , icicle stems , awaited the lemon pudding . But her mother was out of the kitchen  --  on the back porch telling her father to hurry , because they would have to have dinner early if they were to get to the festival in time . " Festival ! " Cress heard her father say . " I wish I 'd never heard of that festival . How did Cress ever come to get mixed up in this dancing business , anyway ? " he asked . " She 's no dancer . Why , the poor kid can hardly get through a room without knocking something over . Let alone dance ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " her mother explained . " To overcome her awkwardness . And she is bet-ter . " " But is she good enough ? " asked her father . " I 'd hate to think of her making a spectacle of herself  --  to say nothing of having to sit and watch it . " " Now , John , " Cress heard her mother say soothingly . " You 're always too concerned about Cress . Will she do this right ? Will she do that right ? Stop worrying . Cress 'll probably be fine . " " Maybe fall on her ear , too , " her father said morosely . " They ought n't to put so much responsibility on kids . Performingin public . Does n't it worry you any ? " " Certainly it worries me . But all parents worry . And remember , we 'll have the star of the performance with us . You can concentrate on Nedra if watching Cress is too much for you . " " That Nedra ! The only dance I can imagine that girl doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a platter . " Cress had started back down the hall before her father finished this sentence , but she had not gone so far as to miss its final word . She stopped in the bathroom to have a drink of water and to see how she looked in the mirror over the washbasin . She looked different . For the first time in her life , she saw herself through other eyes than her own . Through her parents ' eyes . Did parents worry about the figures their children cut ? Were they embarrassed for them , and did they wonder if they were behaving suitably ,  |p122stylishly  , well ? Cress felt a vacant , hollow space beneath her heart , which another glass of water did nothing to fill . Why , I 'm all right , Cress thought . I know how to behave . I 'll get by . They 're the ones . . . but she looked at her face again and it was wavering , doubtful  --  not the triumphant face she had imagined , smiling in sureness as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She went back to her room full of thought . Bernadine was changing her costume , and her muffled voice came from under all her skirts . " Did you tell them ? " this muffled voice asked . " No , " said Cress , " I did n't . " " Why not ? Wo n't you be worried ? " " They 're the ones who are worrying . About me . " " About you ? " " Father thinks I may fall on my ear . " Bernadine , clear of her skirts , nodded in smiling agreement . " It 's a possibility that sometimes occurs to me , Cress dear . " Cress gazed at her friend speculatively . " They 're worried about you , too , " she said . " Me ? " asked Bernadine , her smile fading . " Father said the only dance he could imagine you doing was one with a head on a platter . " " Salome ! " Bernadine exclaimed with pleasure . " Your father 's imaginative , is n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cress said , and in her confusion told everything . " He keeps schedules . "  | " Schedules ? " " For the better ordering of his life . " Bernadine laughed again . " How precious ! " she said . Then , as if remembering after too long a lapse the dayand her bereavement , she said , " Neddy was like that , too . " " Neddy , " repeated Cress , pain for the present makingBernadine 's past seem not only past but silly . " Oh , shutup about Neddy , Bernadine ! " Bernadine gave a little gasp . " Have you forgotten it 's Friday ? " " I do n't care what day it is , " Cress said . She walked over to her bed , picked up the pillow , and lay down . Then she put the pillow over her face.  |p124They  were both in the side yard when Cress got home , her mother cutting zinnias , her father holding them and complaining about the coming wind . Cress heard him as she rounded the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers he called out , " I suppose you ordered this weather , Cress ? " This was an old pleasantry and Cress did n't bother to reply to it . Instead she asked , " Is it all right if I start takingmusic lessons on Monday ? " " Music lessons ! " her father echoed , as if she had suggestedlessons in tight-rope walking or sword-swallowing . " At your time of life ? " Cress had been urged toward music lessons since the age of six . Neither her father nor mother could carry a tune and both of them felt that if Cress would express only a little inclination toward music , their stock would have , culturally , made some advance . But no . Cress would have none of it . Sit on a piano stool hour after hour going tink , tink , tink , with the ends of her fingers , when she could be using all of her body swimming ? Or climbing hills ? What a crazy idea ! How could people waste their lives thatp125way ? Now she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard music until recently , " she told them . " I had no idea what music was , really . " Her mother paused in her zinnia-cutting . She held one big saffron-colored flower , the size of a salad plate , and ran her thumb around its cog-wheel edge . " Does Mrs. Charlesbois play ? " " Yes . She does . She plays beautifully . She 's a former pupil of Levinsky . " " Where would you take lessons ? " her mother asked . " At school ? " " No , " Cress said . " From Mrs. Charlesbois . She 's going to give lessons . There 's an announcement in this evening 's Star . " Mr. Delahanty handed Cress his zinnias and walked over to the edge of the front lawn . He picked up the Star , unrolled it and turned to the back page . " It 's not with the want ads , " Cress told him proudly . " It 's on the society page . " Mr. Delahanty turned back to the society page , searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlesbois announcesthe formation of classes for instruction in the art of piano-playing , beginning on September 17th . Mrs. Charlesbois , a former pupil of Levinsky , is recently of Los Angeles where she made frequent appearances on the concertstage . She has been guest soloist with such well-known organizations as the Southern California Orpheus Club and the Los Angeles Lyric Society , and is a valued andp126distinguished addition to Tenant music circles . Mrs. Charlesbois is prepared to accept both beginning and advancedpupils . To contact her phone 153 . " Mr. Delahanty re-rolled his paper and took a swing at a low flying swallow . " I wondered how long it would be before she 'd have to take a hand at supporting that rundownranch . One job in the family would n't turn the trick . " " It 's probably more the loneliness than anything else , " Mrs. Delahanty said , handing Cress the saffron zinnia . " Up there on the edge of the hills with nothing but coyotes and buzzards for company a good deal of the time . " Mr. Charlesbois worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some kind , no one seemed to know just what . Certainly not a reporter , for he was the exact oppositeof a news-hawk in appearance , being dumpy ( this in spite of the fact that he was not short ) , with a round , worried face . The Charlesboises had no car and Mr. Charlesbois cut across the Delahanty ranch each morning on his way to catch the 7:10 Pacific Electric , and again each evening , on the evenings when he came home , after getting off the 6:2o . So the Delahantys had had plenty of opportunities to appraise his looks . " Why did n't Charlesbois ask somebody who knew something about ranching before buying that place ? " Mr. Delahanty asked , as if Mrs. Delahanty had never men tioned loneliness . " All right , " he said , " why did n't he ask me ? "  | " It was cheap , " Mrs. Delahanty said . " Maybe cheapnesswas an item . " " Cheapness of that kind is always dear in the long run . " The Charlesbois ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange prices were so high that all land in Tenant which was not straight up and down and to which at least a little water could be piped had been cleared and planted . Now the shallow foothill soil , together with a decade of insufficient fertilizing and spraying had resulted in a grove , yellow-leaved , and overproducing , as dying stock will . " Maybe it was more to get out of the city , than get a producing grove ? " Mrs. Delahanty suggested . Cress , uninterested in why the Charlesboises had located in Tenant , said again , " Is it all right if I start taking lessonsMonday ? " She had first met Mrs. Charlesbois two weeks ago in the hills back of the Charlesbois ranch . She often went up there at sundown , for the pleasure of the run and for the wonderful , sad , alone-in-the-world feeling it gave her to look out over the darkening valley at that hour . She had been standing on Lookout Rock , half-childishly frightened by the cicadas buzzing about her heels with their rattlesnakesound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump please . I 'm just another human being . " She had jumped , of course , and Mrs. Charlesbois had put out a steadying hand . " Could n't you tell by the wayp128the katydids stopped singing that someone was coming ? " " I did n't notice that they did stop . " " What ! Not a Campfire Girl , not a Girl Scout ? " " I was a Blue Bird once , " Cress had admitted , painfully bound to literal truth-telling , though she saw how unimportantit was . " I would never have guessed it . You look far more like a quail or meadow lark . Even , " she had added , laughing , " a road-runner . " Mrs. Charlesbois had looked like what ? She had had on white shorts that first afternoon and a white blouse ; but Cress had never seen her in shorts again and certainly never thought of her that way . She always wore white , though , white dresses that to Cress 's mind were old-fashioned . They reminded her of dresses she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with puffier sleeves and fuller skirts than women wore nowadays ; and they were always made of materials , the names of which Cress had never before heard . It had become a kind of game with them . Cress would rub a fold of the full skirt between thumb and forefinger and ask , " Is this marquisette ? " , the day-before 's dress having been of marquisette , and Mrs. Charlesbois would reply , " No silly , this is poplin . " Or , " Soisette , " or " Madras shirting . " They were all wash materialsanyway , and they were always freshly washed and ironed and had that sweet smell garments sun dried and newly ironed have . Though that was far from being Mrs. Charlesbois ' only scent : she used perfume and lots of it  --  pI29Quelques Fleurs , which was perfect for her . How terrible if she had been attracted to  --  though with her taste she could n't have been , of course  --  something unsuitable like My Sin or Shocking . No , Quelques Fleurs with its fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , was Mrs. Charlesbois . It was almost as if the manufacturers had been thinking of her when they made it . Cress tried to catch , through the rank , really weedy , smell of the massed zinnias she held , a trace of Quelques Fleurs from the inside of her own elbow where Mrs. Charlesbois had sprayed some . " Neither yes , no , nor kiss my foot , " her father was saying , " let alone thank you ? " " What ? " Cress asked , though as she said the word , a recording-machine , deep inside her head , played back the sentences she had not heard . " Sure . Start lessons Monday if you want to . Why not ? " " Thank you , " Cress said , hearing that re-playing . " Thank you more than I can say . " Her father looked at her meditatively , seemed about to speak , then without speaking , unrolled , once again , his paper . Her mother , clipping off dead blossoms , said , " I declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cress , chin-deep in the zinnias , stood looking out toward the gap between Old Saddle Back and Old Gray Back , the gap the wind blew through . A little smudge about the size of a man 's thumb was lodged there . Already ,  |p130sixty  miles away , the wind was blowing . It would still be blowing on Monday when she started her lessons . That made Monday seem less far away . Anybody , Cress thought happily , who takes music lessonsis crazy , crazy , crazy . Music lessons were fully as awfulas she had imagined and the worse the better , for they proved that there was nothing she would n't do to be near Mrs. Charlesbois . It was the afternoon of her fourth lessonand she was having the half-hour of supervised practicewhich followed it . Mrs. Charlesbois was in the kitchen , clinking and stirring , busy with the special supper she was cooking ; but now and then , with her starched skirts rustling like palm leaves , she swept into the living room , put a wet , or floury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened her wrist and said , " Thumb under third finger , under , under , under . Make it smooth , not fast . Smooth , smooth . That is the way . " Then she would rustle back to the Beef Stroganoff , leaving the air about the piano sweet with Quelques Fleurs . Thumb under third finger smoothly was hard work . Cress labored with it . There was no light , quick tink , tink , tink , when she practiced  --  as once she had imagined there would be , but a slow heavy tunk . Tunk . Tunk . " You are the worst of my pupils , " Mrs. Charlesbois would declare , fondness in her voice . " I have never seen your like . " " Worse than Linton Matthews ? " Cress would ask . Linton was a boy her own age , taking piano lessons to help his stammering.  | " No comparison at all . " " Worse than Don Rivers ? " Don Rivers was a grown man , though a young one , a road superintendent who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordion . " Am I worse than Don Rivers ? " The worse she was , Cress thought , the more it proved that Mrs. Charlesbois was her friend as well as her teacher . Perhaps more friend than teacher . " Beside you , Crescent Delahanty , " Mrs. Charlesbois had said , " Don Rivers is a great artist , a second Liszt . " Cress had laughed at this exaggeration . Mr. Rivers left his accordion , an enormous thing , almost as large as a bale of hay , at the Charlesboises ' between lessons . The tent at the road camp where he lived with the other men who were working on the Imperial Highway Project was not a safe place to keep so expensive an instrument . " When does he practice ? " Cress had asked . " Here , after lessons . Like you . " " But I practice at home , too . " " Mr. Rivers is n't a beginner like you . He does n't really need practice . All he needs is a place to play where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun of a grown man who loves it  --  the way they do down at the road camp . " " In the movies , " Cress had said , " men on jobs love music . They always sit around campfires at night singing and playing . Railroad gangs and cowboys and miners . And the like . " " Not the kind of music Mr. Rivers plays and understands . Not serious music . "  | " Maybe not , " Cress had admitted . She really did n't know , and she liked Mr. Rivers . He had his lesson just after hers . Five to six . Her lesson was late because of school , and his , because of his work , was still later . After dinner would 've been even better for him , Mrs. Charlesboissaid , but it was too much to expect Mr. Charlesbois to put up with the eternal sound of music . " He has to hear enough as it is , just listening to me , without the additional uproar of pupil-practice being added . " " Uproar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wife 's playing as an uproar . " I think he 's terrible . He must loathe music , really . " But Mrs. Charlesbois would not hear a word against her husband , ever . " Now , Cress , " she had warned , then softened her warning by saying , " You know very well Cress , that the accordion is not everyone 's instrument . " Maybe not . Anyway , Cress liked Mr. Rivers . He had driven her home one night when her lesson had run late and he had arrived early . He was a dark , beak-nosed young man , smiling , but not very talkative and as polite to her as he was to Mrs. Charlesbois . He was going to have dinner tonight with her and Mr. and Mrs. Charlesbois . Cress would have preferred to have been the only guest , but she knew quite well that Mrs. Charlesbois could n't show preference for any one pupil . At seven o'clock Mrs. Charlesbois took Mr. Charlesbois ' plate off the table . He was obviously not coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from thep133city until 9:47 . " He hates being pinned down to any particularhour , " Mrs. Charlesbois explained . " And actually he ca n't always tell . Things come up . " She lit the candles in the branched crystal holders , brought in the iced fruit cups and the three of them sat down at the round table . Cress could n't keep her eyes off Mrs. Charlesbois . She had on one of her usual white wash dresses , though this one was cut low enough in the neck to show the first firm upswelling of her bosom . The skin there , like that of her face , was a rosy-olive and , somehow , velvety-looking . She had three little scarlet pom-pom dahlias just in front of her knot of chestnut hair ; they were so solid looking you could almost imagine them to be wooden , the carved heads of the skewer-like pins it would take to hold up hair so long and so heavy . Mrs. Charlesbois presided as if the dinner were very important ; yet she was so laughing and girlish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace of piano playing , that Cress felt , beside her , quite heavy and matronly . Sometimes she felt sorry for Mr. Rivers , Mrs. Charlesboisleft him so much out of the conversation ; as if he were only an audience for her and Cress 's talk . She would touch Cress when she got up to change course , give her shoulder a little squeeze or smooth one of her eyebrows with a delicateforefinger . She was almost incandescent , Cress thought , burning bright , like Blake 's tiger , her hands flickering out to warmly touch , like flame-tips . After dinner they sat in the living room . Mrs. Charlesboisbrought the candles from the dining-room table andp134put them on the piano . Then she lit two big chunky candles on the mantel and put a match to the already laid fire . Becausethere was greasewood in it , the smell was of outdoors , and this was strange in a living room with a grand piano and a bust of Beethoven on a white pedestal . Mrs. Charlesbois stood , after the fire caught , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , " she said in a low excited voice . " Oh do look how they glitter . " Cress did look and it was true . There were only two small rugs on the floor , and the bare floorboards reflected all the wavering unsteady lights . There were no curtains at the windows and though there were blinds , these were not pulled and the black night pressed against the glass like a depth of unfathomable water and bore the candlelighton the surface of its darkness as it were a mirroring pond or lake . After they had looked for a while Mr. Rivers said , " Wo n't you please play for us ? " " No , not tonight , " Mrs. Charlesbois said . " With you two , music is my business . Let 's not have any business tonight . Let 's visit , let 's be friends . Let 's have a festival of talk . You start , Cress . " Cress asked a question she had been wanting to ask for a long time . " Tell us about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture , a large one in a narrow gilt frame , hung on the wall just above the keyboard of the piano so that Cress , when she practiced , often looked at it . The picture was of Mrs. Charlesbois as a girl . She wore a purple ( the picture was hand-tinted ) velvet dress , with a train , and there wasp135white fur , ermine , Cress believed , around the neck and the edges of the great bell-shaped sleeves . On her head  --  she wore her hair long even then  --  was a golden tiara , just large enough to encircle the mound of her up-piled hair . " Was that , " Cress asked , " the dress for your coming-out party ? " " Coming-out party ! Oh , Cress ! " Mrs. Charlesbois ' laugh was like her hair and skin , warm , a mingling of rosiness and darkness . Her voice laughed at the funniness of that suggestion , but it cried , too , at something sorrowfulin it . She left the fireplace and took the picture off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as if it were a mirror . " Coming-out party ! Sweet little Cressy . What would I have come out of ? Or to ? " She carried the picture over to Mr. Rivers and Cress was the audience now as Mrs. Charlesbois , one hand on the back of Mr. Rivers ' chair , addressed her talk to him . " Were you ever in Oilinda ? " she asked . " A little oil town up in the stubble hills , the houses throbbing all night with the pumps and the coyotes coming down at dawn to steal the kids ' pet rabbits ? " Mr. Rivers looked up from the picture , saying no by a shake of his head . " You 've missed nothing , " Mrs. Charlesbois declared . " I was born there . I think maybe I 'm the only baby who ever was . Most pregnant women could n't stand the smell of the oil and the constant throb of the pumps and the buzzards and snakes . Anyway I was born there and went to school there and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture of me , Queen of the Orange County Fair . " " They could n't possibly have elected anyone else . " " They could have , but they did n't . Fifteen or twenty other girls were candidates , but I won easily . Oil men make big money , or did then  --  and they are easy spenders . You voted , " she explained , " by buying tickets at a quarter each . One man , a driller , bought an even hundred . So I won . I reigned for the five days of the Fair , rode around the county sitting on the back of a convertible and accompanied by a five-piece band . Such crazy nonsense ! On the second night of the Fair , I was formally inaugurated , floodlights , a full band then , and so forth . They gave me this ring , that night . It was my prize for winning the election . " She held up her left hand and showed them the diamondshe wore above her wedding ring . " It is small , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but deep and true in color . " Then , looking over Mr. Rivers ' shoulder , and speaking objectively , " She was really quite a pretty girl then . " There was a small silence , before Mr. Rivers , as if the truth must be spoken , however awkward or difficult , said , " She was beautiful , Inez . She still is . " It was the first time Cress had ever heard Mrs. Charlesboiscalled by her first name . She looked at her as if , beneath the familiar outline , she might see emerging a new and more intimate personage . And for a minute that hiddenperson did partially emerge ; that sweet , regal , newlyp137crowned girl was there in the room , more real than the grown-up music teacher . " Oh , Mr. Rivers , " she said . " Thanks , thanks . I was seventeen then and that was seventeen years ago . Why , I 'm old enough to be Cress 's mother . Easily old enough . " At first , Cress thought proudly that Mrs. Charlesbois was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't I have a daughter like Cress ? " But she was n't sure , because the next words she said were , " Me , me , Inez Dresden . " She took the picture from Mr. Rivers and went to the window with it , and gazed into the picture , rather than at it , since that was the darkest spot in the room . " I was the first Queen they had ever had who could do anything except pose in a bathing suit or ride on a rolled-back convertibletop . When they found I could play the piano , they had me play every night in the intermission between band pieces . " Cress said , " Oh , I wish I could have seen you . And heard you . " " I was just about as good then as I am now , I 'm afraid . " " Afraid ? " Cress said . " One should grow , develop . " " Geniuses , " Cress said fiercely , " ca n't improve like other people , can they ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Once again Cress had the feeling that the young queen was there in the room . But Mrs. Charlesbois , the music teacher , came back and chided her . " Do n't be silly , Cress . " Nevertheless she ran her fingerp138over the glass of the picture , as if hunting for that lost fur and velvet . And diadem . " I met Luther the last night of the Fair , " she said . " Luther ? " Cress repeated . " Mr. Charlesbois . He came up onto the grandstand and played a duet with me . He 'd had about one bottle of beer too much and someone had dared him to do it . We played Beethoven 's Appassionata together . " Mr. Rivers , who knew about serious music , said , " TheAppassionata ! " Cress said , " I did n't know Mr. Charlesbois played . I did n't know he even liked music . " " I do n't think he does any more , " Mrs. Charlesbois replied , taking the picture back to its place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Charlesboises ' . At ten thirty Mrs. Charlesbois asked , " Is there really any sense in your going home at this hour , Cress ? Why do n't I just call your mother and tell her you 're spending the night here ? There 's no telling whether or not Mr. Charlesbois will be home tonight and while I 'm not exactly afraid to stay alone here , I 'm not exactly happy about it either . " Mrs. Delahanty of course said , " Stay , " and after that Cress was often at the Charlesboises ' . She would fall asleep in her room upstairs in the Swiss chalet , listening to the sound of Mr. Rivers ' serious music on the accordion . She understood better now why Mr. Rivers ' music was never going to keep men at a road camp sitting around a camp/fire in the evening . She herself would have preferred the Beer Barrel Polka to the mournful , uncadenced cries which seeped upward to her . On the nights when Mr. Charlesbois came home there was , out of deference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind , either serious or pleasant to hear . Though Cress still felt considerable hardness of heart toward Mr. Charlesbois for what appeared to her to be his neglect of his wife and for his loss of interest in her music , this feeling was tempered some by a talk she had with Mr. Charlesbois himself . She had come home one Saturday afternoon at the beginning of December on the same Pacific Electric car as Mr. Charlesbois . She had spent the night before with her grandfather in Whittier and Mr. Charlesbois , through work early because it was Saturday , had taken the 4:10 out from town instead of the 6:20 . Cress had n't seen him on the car and was surprised when he alighted with her at the Tenant station . They walked the mile to the Delahanty ranch together , talking as they went . Cress saw that , though Mr. Charlesboiswas neither handsome nor commanding , she had been mistaken to think him nothing . His face was biscuitshaped , round , rather doughy and biscuit-colored , too . And when he took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dun-colored hair , the faint pinkness of his scalp . But his eyes were a strong , flashing gray and when he looked at her she was aware of his thoughtfulness ; aware that , as he talked , he thought of her . Mr. Charlesbois seemed not only to leave himself behind but  --  could it be ?  |  --  to surround her with some kind of understanding and even sympathy as he talked . Would he do that ? He , an elderly ( Mr. Charlesbois was at least forty-five ) almost bald man ? But it was not a certain thing , of course . And in any case , she did n't mind . When they reached the arroyo on the Delahanty ranch where their paths separated , Mr. Charlesbois stayed on for a few minutes talking . It was by now a clear , green winter evening . The rains were late and there was a summerwarmness and dryness in the air . And though the scent of the Valencias , blossoming all about them , was typical of December , still their sweetness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat back on his head , but to one side , and with his baldness thus coveredand with his cocky inquisitive stance , feet apart and head tilted downward toward her , Cress saw , as she never had before , how this man could be the one who had volunteered to play duets with the soloist at the County Fair . " I hear you 've been kind enough to keep Inez company on some of the evenings when I 've been away . " " Yes , " Cress answered , " I have . But it was n't kindness . " She was caught between a desire for very strong words and a desire not to be silly or sentimental . " It was a high privilege . " This , because it sounded like a speech from her high school principal , she amended by saying , " I dearly love Mrs. Charlesbois . " Though she would have told this to no one else ; Mr. Charlesbois made her feel like being honest . Mr. Charlesbois received this statement quietly . " Ip141know , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , as if he too feared the mawkishness Cress had tried to avoid , he swept his hat off once again and made her a stiff , stocky bow , " Us two great lovers , " he said . They both laughed at this : Cress at the idea of a man of Mr. Charlesbois ' age being called a lover of any kind , let alone a great lover . The tension that the word love had set up being relieved by the laughing , Cress said , " I 'm staying this Monday night too . " Then , because a little embarrassment still lingered , she said self-consciously , " If you 're home I can play my first real piece for you . " " What is it ? " Mr. Charlesbois asked . " Barcarole ' from The Tales of Hoffmann ! Simplified , of course , " she admitted . " Well , " Mr. Charlesbois said , " that 's real progress . " He whistled a few bars , then sang , " Night in June , O beauteous night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decemberand night coming on . No , I wo n't be home Monday , but you can play it for me some other time . And you take good care of Inez . It has always made her uneasy , being alone . " Monday night was the most beautiful night she had had , so far , at the Charlesboises ' ; and even though Mr. Rivers stayed for dinner too she had come not to mind him very much . In fact , once or twice when she and Mrs. Charlesboishad been alone for dinner some of the magic had been missing . The outward surfaces had been the same ; the warm glowing skin , the fresh white dress , the usual kindp142graciousness ; but Inez Dresden , the young queen , had been absent . And nothing Cress could say , no funniness or compliment could bring her back ; and once having seen that Mrs. Charlesbois , no one was going to be content with any other . Also the presence of Mr. Rivers seemed to reconcile Mrs. Charlesbois ( and Cress had become reconciled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that she was old enough to be Cress 's mother . Cress had even heard her say once to Mr. Rivers , when Cress had been out on the porch with the saucer of milk for the cat , " Where has that child of ours disappeared to ? " This was the first night they had had music after dinner . " Inez , " Mr. Rivers said ( Mr. Rivers and Mrs. Charlesbois , now that they knew each other better , were always " Don " and " Inez " to each other ) , " wo n't you play for us this evening ? " Mrs. Charlesbois , who had always before said no to this question , said , as if she had only been waiting to be asked , " Of course , Don , I 'll play for you . Then you can play for me and Cress can play for both of us . " And that was what they did , no questions asked about , " What do you want , " or any nonsense of that kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if , long ago , it had been settled that whatever Mr. Rivers wanted , she wanted too . Cress had no idea what was being played ; and she saw clearly enough that this was no time  --  though she had a bent that way  --  for picking up musical facts , memorizingp143the names of composers and compositions . The sounds which Mrs. Charlesbois ' strong pink-nailed fingers brought out from the piano were to be heard and felt , not labeled or pigeonholed . Now , Cress thought , Mrs. Charlesbois is not the young queen , but something greater , even . But what was greater than a young queen ? Summer was greater , Cress thought , and a deep river and the ocean , and it was of these she was reminded . Mrs. Charlesbois was so beautiful ! She had a kind of satiny sheen like plums or grapes , fully ripe but not yet touched . It was a winter 's night but Mrs. Charlesbois put summer in the room . June in December , as Mr. Charlesbois had said . The scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came off a real garden where real flowers opened their trumpets to invite the sun 's entry down to the last granule of golden pollen . Mr. Rivers ' playing was quite different , no summer sounds or scents came from that great instrument of his . What he played was night and storm and darkness , things anyone sitting in the dark would want music to blot out . Islands of sound ! Silence between the islands . No way for a non-swimmer to get from one island to the next . 1 s land after island , each new , and stranger than the last . The accordion , Cress supposed , was the nearest there was to a human lung , most able to cry and bewail and entreat . Stop , stop , she wanted to say to Mr. Rivers . And he did stop , suddenly , with no sign given beforehandthat a stop was coming , no flourish of any kind . No crescendo , Cress thought , using her newly acquiredp144knowledge . Just cessation . His arms hung at his sides ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlesbois did not say a word to him  --  any more than he had spoken to her when she finished playing . But she helped him out of the harness of that crying instrument , before turning to Cress . " Now it 's your turn , " she said . Up to the minute of that command Cress had supposed that she would play , that she was waiting to play . But when the command came she was suddenly tired and sleepy . And she saw how absolutely crazy the notes of her simplified " Barcarole " would fall into a room still echoing with those other notes . " If you 'll excuse me , " she said , " I think I 'll go to bed . " She went to sleep at once and awakened to the sound of Mrs. Charlesbois and Mr. Rivers playing together . The music , much hushed by the time it reached the second story of the chalet , might have been dreamed . Cress rested on her elbow for a time listening , assuring herself by continuing to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , then two lines of a verse she would like to write for Mrs. Charlesbois came to her mind . There was an empty place in her heart , which she would have to do something to fill . If she had been able to play her music , that might 've taken away the pain of something unexpressed , undone . She turned on the light by her bed and got , from her school bag , paper and pencil . After she had put down the two lines , a third came by itself ; but the fourth she could not get even by making lists of rhymingp145words . But no sooner had she turned out the light and tried to sleep than there it was . She made a fair copy of her verse and above it wrote , " A Few Lines for Mrs. Charlesbois . " She was pleased by this title , by her modesty and understatement in calling what was actually her entire heart and devotion , " A Few Lines . " Looking at her verse she had a sudden impatience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The emptiness of the act unperformed was n't filled simply by writing . And thoughshe could n't awaken Mrs. Charlesbois at that hour of the night to say , " Here is a poem , Mrs. Charlesbois , to say how much I love you , " she could slide her sheet of paper under Mrs. Charlesbois ' door where she would find it the moment she opened her eyes in the morning . Cress went down the stairs barefooted , filled with the happiness of doing . Either Mr. Charlesbois had n't come home at all on Tuesday and Wednesday nights , or he had come home on the late car . Cress had kept a sharp look-out for him but had n't seen him . On Thursday night she walked intothe Tenant station and was waiting in the shadow of the building when the 6:2o pulled in . She watched Mr. Charlesbois come heavily down the steps , noted that he was hatless and that he had pushed his newspaper , folded any old way , into his bulging coat pocket . " Mr. Charlesbois , " she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her sorrow and pity had been for herself . She remembered hearing Mrs. Charlesbois telling every/body , one time when she had gone into town with her and her mother , " Oh Cress is more than a pupil . She stays with me almost every Monday night . " " Yes , Mr. Charlesboisis away a good deal , but Cress stays with me when he 's gone . " " Oh no , I 'm not lonely . I almost look forward to the nights Luther is gone , Cress and I have such good times . " And I was nothing to her , Cress thought bleakly . Nothing . She perhaps even loathed me , but she had to put up with me , I was so convenient for her . After a while she had stopped thinking of her own hurt and deception and thought of Mr. Charlesbois . What of him ? He was still deceived . He still believed . " Us two great lovers . " And we were nothing to her . Nothing . Me , a convenience , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow calling in a louder voice , for Mr. Charlesbois , head down , was already walking away from the station . He turned at her call and came back toward her . " Why , Cress ! " he exclaimed . " I did n't see you on the car . You been up visiting your grandpa again ? " " I was n't on the car , " Cress said . " I came especially to meet you . " Mr. Charlesbois looked at her with some surprise , but said only , " That was nice of you . " They started their homeward walk in silence . It was a dark moonless night with only a handful of stars to be seen between the big threatening clouds . Except that the path they traveled was well known to both , going would have been difficult.  |p147As  it was , they walked quickly , sometimes abreast , sometimessingle file . Cress , who had believed that her sense of duty was strong enough to make it easy for her to tell Mr. Charlesbois what she had to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Charlesbois himself said , " Well , did you play your Barcarole ' Monday night ? Simplified version ? " " No , " Cress answered . After a while , she said , " They played , though . " " They ? You mean Inez and Mr. Rivers ? " " Inez and Don , " Cress said . " Inez and Don . That 's right . First names do n't come easy to me . It 's a wonder I 'm not calling you Miss Dela-hanty . " Cress went on desperately , in spite of this playfulness . " I came down to meet you , Mr. Charlesbois , to tell you that Monday night  --  " Mr. Charlesbois finished for her . " To tell me you had a fine shindig Monday night . Played music . Made fudge , maybe . " " No , " Cress said , " oh no , it was nothing like that . It was the opposite of that . I came to tell you that afterwards , after I went to bed I came downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Charlesbois said . " I have it right here . " He clapped a hand against his coat pocket . " I like it . I 've thought what you say in it a lot of times myself , but I have n't your gift for words . I can say it by heart , if you want me to . "  | " Do n't , " Cress cried . " Do n't say it . You would n't want to say it if you knew  --  " " Knew , " Mr. Charlesbois interrupted her . " Why I know everything , Cress . By my time of life there 's nothing a man does n't know  --  whether he wants to or not . All a man at my time of life can learn is new ways of saying things like this pretty rhyme of yours : She had the dark and windswept beauty Of the hills from whence she came . " " No , " Cress insisted . " No , please do n't say it . " She made one more effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " He once again completed her sentence for her . " We both love Inez . " " Did , " Cress said . " We did . " " No , " Mr. Charlesbois contradicted her , " we do . I know everything , and you know quite a lot . For a girl your age  --  , " he said , and though it was too dark to see , his voice sounded as if his face might have that same crooked Jack O'Lantern smile she had seen when he said , " Us two great lovers "  --  " for a girl your age you 're downrightloaded with knowledge . And both of us love Inez . Only you can say it in rhyme and I ca n't . So long , " he said . " It 's late and it 's going to rain before I get home if I do n't hurry . " From some distance up the arroyo he called back , " I 'm still looking forward to hearing you play that Barcarole . ' Grown-up version , no simplifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p149Cress  stopped beside a lemon tree near the house for a while before going in . The light shone outward onto the waxy yellow fruit and she picked a lemon , rolled it between her hands until it was soft , then broke its skin with her thumbnail and began to suck it . A few drops from the coming storm spattered onto her forehead and hands . She wanted to stay out in the rain , be drenched , muddied , cold . She knew exactly what she had tried to do and why . It was perfectly clear to her and now she would like to stay out until she was half-drowned and worried about , then go in and be made the center of a considerable to-do , dried and warmed and comforted . She went in just as she was , however , scarcely dampened , pausing at the door only long enough to throw away her half-sucked lemon.  |p150It  was early spring . In the arroyo , a quarter of a mile south of the Delahanty ranch , cactus was already blooming . Meadow larks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in insects , impaled their surplus stock on suitable thorns . Road-runners ran for pleasure and without pursuit . Ground squirrels , bereft of what little caution they possessed at other seasons , frisked at great distances from their burrows . Buzzards floated low , their shadows dark on the grass which the sun , almost down , was gilding . But the air was still warm , the day still lovely , and the arroyo continued to echo , as it had for the past hour , with the stateliest measures ever molded by the lips of man  --  the long rolling periods of Virgil . " Ancora de prora iacitur , stant litore puppes , " Edwin concluded , taking his eyes from his invisible audience and looking inquiringly at Cress , who sat across the ravine from him on a large , sun-warmed boulder . " Begin at the beginning and say it all over again , " Cress urged . " Not that I do n't think you 're perfect right now , " she added frankly . Edwin relaxed somewhat , but still looked worried. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded Cress . " Well , I do n't see how you can improve it , " Cress protested , her fair , freckled face flushed with sunlight and her pleasure in Edwin . " You know every word by heart and you pronounce every word right . What more could you do ? " Edwin scowled across the narrow arroyo as if its smallnesshampered his imagination . " If I was good enough , " he said slowly , " I could put the whole spirit of Virgil in it . " He paused and looked earnestly at Cress . " If I was good enough , I could put the whole spirit of the ancient world in it . " " Well , O.K. , then , " Cress said enthusiastically . " Let 's do that . Let 's be absolutely terrific . " Edwin replied a little stiffly , " I was n't joking . " " Me either , " Cress exclaimed , surprised . " Was n't that what you meant , Edwin ? " " I was n't thinking about being terrific or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'm sorry , Edwin . " " You kind of always overstate things , Cress . " " Edwin , " Cress asked leaning forward , " do you thinkI 'm impetuous ? " Edwin removed his steel-rimmed spectacles and cleaned them on an oblong of white canton flannel neatly featherstitchedin blue around the edges . Cress took note of it , thinking she might make Edwin another for his birthdayp152if she could learn to feather-stitch in three months ' time , which she doubted . " Do you , Edwin ? " she repeated . Edwin resettled his spectacles . " I think you 're pretty hasty sometimes , Cress . " Hasty was not the same as impetuous , and Cress returned to Virgil . " Go on , Edwin , " she said . " Say your part through from the beginning again . " " It 's your turn to say your part , " Edwin told her . " My little two lines , " Cress scoffed . " A chain is no stronger than its weakest link , " Edwin said honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play " The play , " Scenes from The Aeneid , " was to be presented in one week 's time by the Latin department of Tenant High School . Each spring , wearing togas and huaraches , garlanded with chaplets of eucalyptus leaves and carrying short swords carved from Sunkist orange boxes , the Latin classes demonstrated to assembled parents their mastery of the language . This year 's demonstration was unusually ambitious and Edwin as narrator was , after Aeneas himself , its most important male personage . Looking at Edwin now Cress thought that , with his dark hair falling in a jagged line across his high white forehead and his eyes lifted to the rim of the arroyo , he looked like a great tragic actor , or perhaps , except for his glasses , Hamlet himself . It was easy to imagine that the battlements of Elsinore had been of the same smoky graygreenas the tall cactus which now served him as a back/drop and that the problems which he pondered had to do , not with a high school Latin play , but with love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , " would you like to play Hamlet ? " Edwin shook his head . He had no illusions about his qualifications as an actor , nor about the problem he had presented to Miss Freitag , Latin teacher and director of the play . He was the best student in Miss Freitag 's classes and he could memorize Latin verse more easily and deliverit with greater sonority and conviction than any other of her pupils . But his appearance was woefully unclassicand he knew it . And not only did he have a nonVirgilianlook , but in some unfortunate manner he communicateda non-Virgilian look to all which , until he came upon the scene , appeared authentic . Edwin seemed to be a touchstone of reality . The minute he stepped onto the stage , chaplets , which , until that time had been easily recognizable as of the true laurel , became nothing more than circles of wire incompletely covered with eucalyptus leaves . And the short swords , for all their aluminum paint , immediately reverted to the soft pine of orange boxes . Worst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque and dignified garment , obviouslyappropriate for poets and statesmen , appeared on Edwin to be a costume downright unsuitable for public wear . Miss Freitag had tried putting Edwin into a short tunic , but that had been even worse . Atlas Peake , the Aeneas of the play , took one look at him , thus scantily covered ,  |p154and  said , " You 're sure lucky to be living today , Skinny . The Romans would 've exposed you at birth . " Miss Freitag , while considering this statement untactful , thought it probably true , and was proud of her final solution of the problem posed by Edwin . She developed the part of narrator for him , kept him off the stage entirelyand clothed him in a manner intended to suggest a professor of the classics : thin legs hidden by striped gray professorial trousers , narrow shoulders encased in a frock coat , necessary spectacles given the appearance of scholarshipby a length of dangling black grosgrain ribbon . These make-shifts , which Edwin saw truly enough as occasioned by his deficiencies , appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniqueness . Ignoring his reluctance to talk about himself as an actor she said again , " I bet you could play Hamlet if you wanted to . " " Well , I do n't want to , " Edwin answered shortly . " O.K. , " Cress persisted stubbornly . " You do n't have to , but you could . Go on , " she said hurriedly before Edwinhad a chance to contradict her , " say your part through once again . I can say mine on the way home . " Edwin straightened himself as if about to begin , then lowered his chin and looked about . The arroyo while narrow , was deep , a sandy , golden , cactus-filled waste , lonely , strange , and , at this time of the day , a little mysterious . " This probably looks a good deal like Africa , " he said . " Africa ? " Cress asked , her thoughts far from there . " Where Aeneas met Dido . " " Oh ! It 's a good place to be practicing then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's funny , is n't it , Cress ? Here we are reciting Virgil , and Virgil did n't even know the New World existed . Let alone the United States . " " Let alone California . " " Let alone this arroyo and you and me in it , " Edwin said , and he and Cress both laughed . " Maybe he does know , " Cress said . " Maybe he 's alive some place and listening . " " Do you believe in life after death , Cress ? " Edwin asked seriously . Cress sighed with pleasure . Perhaps they would now have a philosophical discussion . That was one of the things she liked so much about Edwin ; he was interested in everything and would talk about everything : life , death , honor , immortality , transubstantiation . Did everyone see the same chair ? If you could hear the intervals of silence in music , would they be music , too ? At what minute did a bird swallowedby a cat cease to want to chirp and begin to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I do , Edwin . Do n't you ? " Edwin did n't reply . Far off in the Santa Ana valley Cress heard a train whistle . A hummingbird dropped into the arroyo , whirred disappointedly about the wild tobacco blossoms which were still too green for honey . A lizard ran halfway up the boulder she sat on , looked at her , then ran down again . " Do n't you , Edwin ? " she asked again . But Edwin only shook his head . Evidently he was not in the mood for a philosophical discussion this afternoon.  | " You got time to hear me through once more ? " he asked . " Of course , " Cress said . " That 's what I 've been waiting for . Begin at the beginning . Begin at , Arms , I sing , and the man . ' " Cress imitated somewhat Edwin 's polished , declamatory style . But without the Latin words the imitationwas rather flat . " Arma virumque cano Troiae qui primus ab oris , " Edwin began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpetnotes . Cress settled back comfortably on her boulder to listen . If Edwin did n't look like a Roman , he at least came nearer than anyone else in Tenant to sounding like one . He had gotten as far as Dido 's curse , " Et iam prima novo spargebat lumine terras , " when glancing at the bank above Cress 's head he broke off . " Hi , there ! " he said in a flat voice . Cress turned about . There , above her , was Clarence Rambo . He was known , because of his red hair and ability to cover ground , as the Crimson Rambler . The Crimson Rambler now stood , legs wide apart and hands in pockets , regarding her and Edwin curiously . " The Rambler himself , " Cress said without enthusiasm . She and Clarence were not on good terms . He had passed her a note in study hall which she , after seeing the first few words , had taken up to the wastepaper basket and ostentatiously torn into a thousand pieces without further reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cress looked with renewed distaste at his red , good-natured face and his small reddish-brown eyes.  | " Nice hide-out you two got here , " he observed . " Hide-out ! " Cress exclaimed . " Yeh , hide-out . What you two do down here , anyway ? " " Do ? We 're practicing , " Cress told him with dignity . This struck the Rambler as being very funny and he laughed immoderately . " Practicing ! " he was finally able to say . " What you two practicing down here in your hideout , Cress ? " " We 're rehearsing for the Latin play , " Edwin said . He pulled his copy of " Scenes from The Aeneid " from his pocket as if to prove it . " Scenes from The Aeneid , ' " he explained . This also seemed very funny to the Rambler . He laughed so hard that the skin was drawn tightly across the two bony protrusions above his eyes and the eyes themselveswere narrowed to the merest slits . " Scenes from The Aeneid ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked them . " Latin is a language , Least it used to be , First it killed the Romans , Now it 's killing me . " " We 've heard it , " Cress said . " It 's very , very funny . Also very , very old . " " I know some more , " Clarence said . " New . Want to hear some more ? Also in Latin . " " Beat it , Rambo , " Edwin said . " Get out of here . We 're busy . "  |p158The  Rambler looked at Edwin very coolly . " Drop dead , Skinny , " he advised , " and save the doctor 's bill . " Then he turned again to Cress . " You want to hear some more , Cress ? I can make up poetry . Latin poetry . " " You and Virgil , " Cress said lamely . " Sure , me and Virgil . I sing of arms and the woman . " " Shut up , Rambo , " Edwin said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off some place and practice . Practice acting alive . This poem 's about you , Cress . Amo , amas , amat , Delahanty 's plenty hot . How d' you like that , Cress ? More truth than poetry , huh ? " Edwin threw " Scenes from The Aeneid " to the ground . " Cut that out , Rambo . " " Oh hell , Skinny , " Clarence said easily , " do n't let it worry you just because it did n't come out of a book . You 'd be surprised what ai n't in books . Besides that 's just the beginning . Amo , amas , amat , Delahanty 's . . . " Clarence stopped suddenly and Cress , who had been watching him , too amazed and shocked to speak , turned toward Edwin . Edwin was holding threateningly aloft a large and very spiny section of the cactus plant beside which he stood . " Do n't that hurt , Skinny ? " Clarence asked finally , a little uncertainly . " You shut up , " Edwin told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , Skinny , " Clarence said , " do n't you know that 's just like pulling a gun on an unarmed man ? " " O.K. , " Edwin said . " I 've got a gun and you 're un/armed . And you better shut up and get out of here or I 'll fire it . And another one right behind it . " Edwin extended his free hand in the direction of the cactus plant at his side . " Two-gun Skinny ! " Clarence 's voice was heavy with sarcasm . " Three-gun , four-gun , if you do n't beat it , " Edwin said , unmoved . " I was only making a little joke . Cress do n't . . . " " Shut up about Cress , " Edwin told him , lifting the cactus section menacingly , " and beat it . " " You do n't have to keep saying it , " Clarence said . " I got no desire to hang around where I 'm not wanted . Where all people can think of to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of cactus . " He climbed the embankmentslowly and unconcernedly . At the top he turned around . " Any time you get brave enough to meet me without a gun , Skinny , just let me know . Things 'll be different then . " Whistling loudly to show his indifference to the entire affair , Clarence disappeared . When he could no longer be heard Edwin dropped the cactus , walked over to the boulderwhich Cress had vacated and sat down . He leaned forward , shoulders hunched , looking at the ground . " Does your hand hurt , Edwin ? " Cress asked . The hand with which he had held the piece of cactus was red , full of spines and already swelling , but Edwin shook his head . " I guess you 're pretty ashamed of me , " he said in a low voice.  | " Ashamed ! " Cress exclaimed . " Pulling a gun on an unarmed man that way . I guess that was pretty tricky , all right . And cowardly . " " Cowardly , " Cress repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing , Edwin , if you had n't . And said anything he wanted to about me . " " A brave man would 've fought him on even terms , " Edwin said dejectedly . " Knuckles to knuckles . " " Knuckles to knuckles ! " Cress cried in disgust . " Why , you did fight him on even terms . He 's got muscles and you 've got brains . You fought his muscles with your brains . " " I 've got some muscles , " Edwin said . " Of course you have . But Clarence Rambo 's got ten times more muscles than anybody I know . It would be like David 's throwing away his sling-shot and going out to wrestle with Goliath . It would be stupid . Knuckles to knuckles , " she said again scornfully . " Is that the way it seems to you , Cress ? " " Yes , it is . And besides , it did n't hurt David any to use his sling-shot and it must have hurt you terribly to pick up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I ever saw . Or heard of . " Cress hurriedly lifted Edwin 's hand and began to examine it . " I can pull out these big ones now , " she told him , " but I ca n't do anything about the little ones without tweezers . " When most of the large needles were out Edwin said , " You never did get to say your part , Cress . "  | " I do n't care , " Cress told him . " Anyway , I think The Aeneid is silly , really . " " Silly ! " Edwin sounded shocked . " The men are all right , I guess . But Dido ! Building herself a funeral pyre because Aeneas was sailing away from her . " Edwin was silent while Cress worked on a final needle . Then he said , " Dido loved Aeneas . " " Well , of course , " Cress answered . " But building herself a funeral pyre because he was leaving her ! " " What would you have done , Cress ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Edwin said nothing . " Which would you want a woman to do , Edwin ? " Cress asked . " I do n't think anyone 's going to jump on a funeral pyre for me or sail after me in a boat , either one , " Edwin said . Cress finished her work on Edwin 's hand before she spoke again . " Of course , in this day and age that 's just figuratively speaking . Funeral pyres and sailing away in boats and so forth . " Edwin stood up and with his good hand pushed back his hair which had fallen further than usual over his forehead . " Figuratively speaking , " he said , " I would n't like you jumping on any funeral pyres , Cress . " He examined the remaining cactus needles closely for a second or two , then looked up . " That is , if I were sailing away ,  - -  which I would n't be . " Cress 's heart gave a sudden deep throb , so that therep162seemed to be no room left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where " Scenes from The Aeneid " lay , picked it up and returned it to Edwin . The sun , just setting , filled the arroyo with a flood of gold and crimson and the meadow larks , as if aware that day was ending , sang with a kind of sad sobriety . Cress , able to breathe easily again , looked about . It 's a thousand times more beautiful here than Africa ever was , she thought and started to say so . But remembering what Edwin had said about overstatements , she contented herself with , " I bet Africa 's not half this beautiful , Edwin . "  | " Who is this Ina ? " her mother asked Cress . " Where does she live ? And I thought Honor Gallagher was your friend of the moment ? " " Honor is , " Cress said , " but she ca n't be thinking of me every minute . And Ina 's full name is Ina Inez Wallenius , " Cress answered . Cress did n't care whether her mother said yes or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had assigned to her for the moment the role of Fate , and Cress was perfectly willing that Fate should know everything she knew about Ina , and then decide . " If her initials had been I.W.W. instead of I.I.W. , she would have stood for International Workers of the World , " Cress said as an afterthought . " It 's Industrial Workers of the World , is n't it ? " said Mrs. Delahanty . " Anyway , it 's wobblies , " Cress said . " Wobblies ! " exclaimed Mrs. Delahanty . " Your friend Ina is n't a wobbly , is she ? " " As a matter of fact , she is n't even a friend , " said Cress . " Not a friend ? " said Mrs. Delahanty , puzzled . " I  |p164thought  you just said she was . I thought that was why you wanted to visit her . " " What I should have said , " Cress told her mother , " was that Ina wants me to be her friend . " Cress did n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to want her for a friend , or of any use to try to explain to her mother the high school 's complicatedsocial structure  --  a structure upon whose upper level she was now located , but not established , and upon whose lower level Ina stood , reaching upward . A visit could put Ina up where she was , or just as easily put Cress down where Ina was . Cress thought it was her duty to give Ina her chance . This was one of the reasons she preferred to leave everything to Fate . There was more responsibility in the visit than she cared to assume . " She 's a nice girl , is she  --  this Ina ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " Oh , she 's a very nice girl ! " Cress said . She did n't say that in her opinion Ina was too nice . She did n't know how that could be possible , but some people were certainly too nice . Ina was n't too nice in the sharp , old-maidish way to which some girls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-boiled eggs in little waxed-paper envelopes , hair ribbons in ready-tied bows . These girls , whatever their ages , seemed like aunts to Cress and she got on very well with them all . Ina had n't been born too nice ; she was that way because she chose to be . And one nice habit she had was just about the most unpleasant Cress had ever heard of . She carriedp165a toothbrush to school with her and every day after lunch she brushed her teeth in the girls ' rest room . And when she had finished , she would smile at herself , so that at least half her teeth , softly shining , were reflected in the basement 's gloomy mirror . Then she would slowly close her full , pink lips over her clean teeth . Why did that seem a bad thing to do ? Cress could n't say , but it did , and , watching her , Cress would shudder . " Wallenius , " said Mrs. Delahanty . " What is that ? Swedish ? " " I guess so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ina 's hair was yellow white and she wore it in heavy , sausage-like curls low on her neck . She had heavy white eyelashes and eyebrows , big , murky blue eyes , and a looseappearinggolden skin . " She 's an orphan , " Cress said , thinking she should perhapsgive Fate more to work on . " An orphan , " her mother repeated . " She surely does n't live alone , does she ? " " I mean she 's a half orphan , " said Cress , for whom a mother was still the most of a family . " Her father 's alive . Ina keeps house for him . " " Have you ever seen him ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " No , but he 's a good old man , I know , " Cress said with assurance . " Ina says he reads a chapter from the Bible out loud before every meal . " " Well , " said Mrs. Delahanty , " I do n't know a reason in the world why you should n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does she live ? "  | " Kettle Hill , " said Cress . " Oh ! " said her mother . Cress knew what that " Oh ! " meant . Kettle Hill , althoughonly ten miles distant by road and six by the spur line down which the tank cars rumbled , carrying the hill 's oil to the main tracks , seemed a world away from the valley , with its orange groves , where the Delahantys lived . It was off by itself , separated by its location and work from the ranches . Did anyone ever go there , Cress wondered , besides the drillers , the riggers , the pumpers , and their families ? One evening when out for a drive , Mr. Delahantyhad taken his family up the road to Kettle Hill and there , Cress had seen , the road stopped . It did n't climb on further into the brown , cactus-covered , snake-inhabited foothills , but ended in a loop among the derricks at the hill 's top . And , though the settlement was on a hillside , Cress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was dark there , not only because the earth was oil-soaked and pocked with sump holes that shone like greasy bruises in the gray dust , but because the oil people , wishing for something green amid the barren forests of their derricks , had planted , years ago , pepper trees along their streets . Now that the trees were old , their foliage sprayed outward in dense , smothering cascades , setting the oil workers ' homes in gloomy caverns of shade . And it was dark there because the hill blotted the sun out early ; while children in the valley below still played in the slanting light of afternoon ,  |p167the  houses of the oil workers would already be deep in evening shadows . The sun , going down behind a Kettle Hill derrick , sometimes seemed to Cress , watching from her own back steps in the valley , to set it ablaze for a second . She had often seen real flames there when a gusher , coming in with force , blew its casing head and caught on fire . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a. fiery torch held up toward the night sky , and gas pockets , , exploding , would rattle valley windows with a doomsday sound . And even when all was going quietly on Kettle Hill , it was not really quiet there . Day and night , the throb and stomp of its engines , the sullen , hollow suck of its pumps filled the air . The sound was so constant that days went by when Cress did not hear it at all ; then sud denly , in the dead of night , she would be awakened by it , , sit bolt upright , and ask herself , " What is that terrible sound ? " " Ina ca n't help living there , " Cress said to her mother accusingly . " Where your folks are , there you have to be . " " Why , I never said she could help it , " Mrs. Delahanty answered . " I never even suggested she would want to help it . And I think it would be a very nice thing for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a nice thing or not , but anyway the matter was now decided . She was . going . She felt very lonely , packing . On the evening before the day she was to leave , she started putting together whatp168she would need for her visit . She was using a little satchel of her father 's as an overnight bag . It was small enough not to be awkward to carry to school on the bus . She was packing things she could n't possibly need , because in her mind the trip was somehow momentous . She had made a list and was checking off articles on it , like an overseas traveler . Her father watched her awhile from the doorwayof her room . " Cress , " he asked , " have you drawn up your will and taken out travel insurance ? " Cress looked up from the midst of the articles she was checking : bottles containing iodine , camphorated oil , attar of roses , hand balm , green ink ; a package of band-aids ; a comb cleaner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had owned it ; a spray of lavender tied with frayed silver gauze and fast breaking down into lavender dust ; a little book bound in purple suede and called " Flowers from Tennyson . " " Let 's see , " said her father . " Just how long is it you 're to be away from us ? " " Till Thursday , " said Cress bleakly . " A whole day ? " Mr. Delahanty asked . " Are you taking a calendar with you ? I would n't want you to lose track of time while you 're away . " Cress knew her father was being funny and she tried to smile , but her face seemed to have lost all of its springiness . It seemed to be nothing more than flesh loosely coveringthe front of her head and useless for purposes of expression.  |p169She  folded a hair net of her mother 's and put it in the satchel . " Crescent , " Mr. Delahanty said , " I bet a witch doctorin the heart of Africa could n't have a crazier mess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could n't explain . She felt as if she might be an entirely different person when she got to Ina 's  --  but different in just what way , she could n't now tell . If , after she arrived , she were to find herself , suddenly , the kind of person who was n't at home without a hair net , she would wish she had a hair net with her . Her father watched her awhile longer . " You give me the creeps , " he said finally , and walked on down the hall . Cress nodded to herself after her father left . That was just how she felt . Creepy . She crept about the rooms , slyly picking up things , as if she were stealing them . Stealing from whom , she wondered . Herself ? Stealing from the room , she guessed . She took her little flowered calendar from the wall , drew a circle around Thursday , May loth , and put the calendar on top of everything else in the satchel . Then , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpaper , tears came to her eyes . " Look here , Crescent , " her mother said , coming into the room . " You know you do n't have to visit your friendIna if you do n't want to . No ones forcing you to go , you know . " " Oh , I want to go ! " cried Cress intensely . " Besides , " she added ' " I feel it 's Fated . "  | " Fated , " repeated Mrs. Delahanty . " Well , in that case , I guess there 's nothing more to be said . " " No , " said Cress in a voice of resignation , " I guess not , " and closed her father 's satchel with a snap . Next evening , when Cress got off the school bus at the foot of the hill with Ina , she was in a mood to be a perfect guest and to see the best in Kettle Hill . For one thing , she felt contrite . She had talked to some of the girls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a slumming trip . " Going to see how the other half lives , " she had said , and listened to the appreciative laughter . When the girls had asked her what she had in her valise , she had said , " My crude-oil-colored week-end wardrobe , so I wo n't spot , " and was rewarded with laughter again . If she had said these things in front of Ina , it would n't have been so bad , but she had n't ; she had been two-faced , said them behind Ina 's back , and the girls had still been snickering when Ina came up to them . The memory of this two-facedness made a sore spot in her chest and , as she climbed the street under the pepper trees , caused her to link her arm through Ina 's . " It 's a ratty little town , " Ina said apologetically . " Why , it 's not either , " said Cress , putting balm on the sore spot . " I think it 's romantic . " In a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading sunlightcame through chinks in the pepper trees and fluttered about upon the hard-packed earth , like a covey of yellow evening birds . The houses , though small , and almost allp171alike , because they were company-owned , were neat and whitewashed . Their porches were filled with large potted plants growing in cheerful red Hills Brothers coffee cans , or with smaller potted plants in green Del Monte peach cans . In some of the houses , the shades were drawn , for here people worked on shifts and one man 's night might be his neighbor 's day . A picket fence , also whitewashed , ran the length of the street , and each man had a private gate to his yard , weighted in such a manner with old springs and defunct batteries that it swung shut of itself and he need never give a thought to its closing . From under the pepper trees , the derricks were out of sight . It was only the smell of the oil  --  which was taste as much as smell  --  the sight of an occasional sump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of the pumps that reminded Cress where she was . The sound of the pumps filled the air , deep , rhythmical , as if the hills themselves breathed ; or as if deep in the wells some kind of heart shook the earth with so strong a beat that Cress could feel it in the soles of her feet as she walked along . Ina seemed not to hear the sound at all , and Cress felt it as much as she heard it . When she put out her hand to touch the palings of the fence , the sound was there , too . In the dead wood were tremblings which seemed almost alive and which kept time with the deep , solemn beat of the pumps . This trembling , this sound that she felt in the soles of her feet and the palm of her hand , excited Cress . " There 's a book in the library , " she said , " called The Romantic Story of Oil . "  | " Is there really ? " said Ina . Ina had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how important she thought Cress 's visit  --  a soft silk pongee middy suit . She stopped beside Cress now and clasped her pongee-colored hands . " Cress Delahanty , " she said , " I think you are the most sweet and tactful girl I know . Oh , I could just about hug you for that ! " she said , reaching out and taking Cress 's hand inside her own soft , folding palm . " Most people , " she confided , " just see the oil , and smell the smells , and miss the romance . " " Most people , " said Cress , working her fingers out of Ina 's hand , " are blind . " For some reason , Ina took her into the house by the back door . She said , " Here we are , " and Cress , carrying her bulging valise , stepped over the threshold and into the kitchen . There she was , at the end of her journey , and she looked about to see where that was ; she was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the table ready set for supper , and chairs standing in front of each place . The room was close , with the smell a kitchen has which is left each morning the minute breakfast is finished and is not re-entered again until evening . The smell of breakfast coffee was still there , and another smell , as if in some cupboard a sack of potatoes had first sprouted , then rotted . Cress had never seen a more orderly room . Over the sink , can openers , egg beaters , potato mashers  --  all the kitchen implements  --  were hung with careful regard for their size , tapering away from the big articles at the sink'sp173edge to the small ones near the faucets . Half a lemon rested in the exact center of a saucer , and the saucer had been placed in the exact middle of the window sill . The chairs , ranged around the set table , were all pushed under it a uniform distance , and on the back of the stove was a stack of pot holders , the largest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orderly . The room was orderly in the way a sickroom is orderly , or the room of a person who has little time or is for some reason unsure of himself . It reminded Cress of a house she had seen somewhere , a house she could only half remember . Then , suddenly , she remembered it altogether  --  the home of a blind friend of her mother 's , a woman who had to depend solely upon her sense of touch to find what she wanted . Ina , as if she knew what Cress was thinking , said , " Father likes everything very neat . He says he wants to be able to put out his hand in the dark and find whatever he wants . " Cress saw Ina looking at her , trying to discover if this seemed strange to her . " I expect I 'm messy , " Cress said . " Oh , no ! " Ina protested , leading the way into the living room . " That 's the last thing I 'd think of calling you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , it 's nice ! " she exclaimed , and then worried for fear the surprise she felt had shown in her face or voice . She had somehow thought of Kettle Hill homes as being faded , run-down , and dingy inside . This room was none of these things ; it was a small , warmly colored , padded/looking room , as if , Cress thought , the Walleniuses had turned a footstool wrong side out and set up housekeeping in it . It bulged softly toward her as she stood in the doorway ; its innumerable curves reached out to touch her . Chairs were plump , the pillows round and solid as boulders ; lamps had egg-shaped bases ; the phonograph of red , shining wood bellied out about the middle , as if swollen with the volume of sound it contained ; even the rug , as she stepped into the room , was not flat but rose in a flowery fuzz under her feet ; and the white lace curtains inclined toward her as if by pressure of a hand or face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage through the pepper trees , was dimmed once again before it got into the room through these curtains , and Cress was startled when her eyes , coming to the room 's final dark corner , saw that a man whom she knew by his resemblance to Ina to be Mr. Wallenius had been very calmly looking at her while she had been looking at the room . He had n't been reading or dozing ; he was n't sitting slumped , resting in his chair . He sat bolt upright , calmly watching the two of them , and when Cress 's eyes discovered him , he rose very politely and spoke . " Good evening , girls . " When Mr. Wallenius stood up , Cress saw that he was a large man , broad as well as tall , old but only old like a father , not like a grandfather , as the Bible reading had led her to believe . His hair was yellow white , like Ina 's , not silvery with age , and he had a yellow-white mustache , very thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , " Ina said , and Cress shrank inside herself a little at seeing how proud Ina was to have a friend . " Cress , " said Mr. Wallenius . He had a pink-and-white skin , not a loose , golden one like his daughter 's , but his voice , Cress thought , had rather a loose , golden sound , like a handful of rings clinked softly together . " Well , well , " said Mr. Wallenius , " so I 'm to have two cooks tonight instead of one . " Then , reaching out both hands , Mr. Wallenius spread open his fingers so that they circled the top of each girl 's head . He did not let his hands rest there , heavy and inert , but moved his long , muscular fingers , so that Cress could feel her scalp being pushed gently this way and that across the top of her skull . " With the two of you , " he said , " I 'm going to expect something extra special this evening . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , with a final pleasant twitch of their scalps , Mr. Wallenius took his hands from their heads and Cress heard him presently spitting and splashing in the bathroom as he brushed and washed for supper . Supper-getting was very simple because Ina had planned it so carefully . Before she had gone to school that morning , she had boiled potatoes and made white sauce . Now she diced the potatoes and put them , together with pink , rubberycubes of bologna , into the pan of white sauce and set the mixture on the stove . While this  --  whatever it was called  --  heated , she opened a can of beets , set them top176cooking , too , and got a bowl of deviled eggs out of the icebox . When the food was ready and they had carried it , dished up on three plates , to the table , Ina said proudly , " I tried to have different colors , and the hot food hot and the cold food cold . " Cress thought she had succeeded very well ; the bolognapotatomixture was pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deviled eggs , in their green nests of lettuce leaves , gray and yellow . Steam rose above the helpingsof heated food ; the eggs shone with a cold and clammy sweat . But the cold food was warmer and the hot food much cooler before they ate , for Mr. Wallenius came into the kitchen , clean and damp from his brushing and scrubbing , just as they put the plates on the table , and asked , " Will you read for us tonight , Miss Cress ? " and placed an opened Bible in her hands . After they took their places , Cress read the chapter through . She was accustomed to the Bible and knew that it was right for her to speak aloud words found there which , elsewhere , it would be very wrong for her to whisper or even think about . So she was able to finish without stumbling or blushing , though she could n't help feeling the chapter was a funny one to have chosen to be read aloud . Then she thought that perhaps the Walleniuses were reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick and choose among God 's words . After the reading was finished and they had begun top177eat , Mr. Wallenius asked , " Did you understand what you read ? " Cress was n't sure whether she had or had n't . If she said yes , she thought , she might be asked to explain , so she said , " No . " " Ah , so , " said Mr. Wallenius . " An old-fashioned home , I expect . Your friend here , Ina , has been long instructed . " Ina got up just then to put the tea on to steep and Cress ate steadily while she was gone , her face low over her plate . The clock in the living room struck half past five and she remembered how early that seemed at home  --  still afternoon  --  while here it was already evening , supper half finished , and night not far distant . At home , her father would be just coming in from the orchard , the slanting sunlight making golden the dust that swirled up about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the driveway , picking up the evening paper and carrying a tidbit of news from it to her father in the barn before she went back into the house to put supper on . It was strange to think that if the clock here and the one at home were both right ( or both wrong in the same way ) , they were striking this half hour together . Thinking of both clocks , Cress felt herself to be a kind of meeting place for two varieties of time , home time and visiting time . Remembering home , these things seemed stranger than they had even on first sight : the half lemon on the window sill had , in the kitchen 's growing duskiness , a sort of misted light of its own ; outside , the long , dangling leaves of the pepper trees moved together with the sound of dry fingersp178meeting ; the faucet at the sink went drip , drip , drip , and Crescent thought of that falling movement and that sound never stopping , day after day , inside the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long time setting the tea to steep , and the slight clatter she made sounded distant and muffled  --  measured , too , as if Ina were listening for the thump , thump of the wells and spacing her movements to keep time with theirs . " Have you ever been kissed ? " Mr. Wallenius asked suddenly . Cress knew at once that he did n't mean by relativesor girls . Keeping her eyes on her plate , she said , " No . " Finally , looking up , Cress saw that while Mr. Wallenius ' eyes were blue , like Ina 's , they were not at all murky , but had instead a shining glaze , like varnish , across their blueness . " You 're big enough , you know , " Mr. Wallenius said , smiling . " I guess it goes more by age than size , " Cress said miserably , and was glad that just then Ina came to the table with the tea and dessert , and that there was no more talk of kissing . When they rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll take Cress out for a little walk while you do the dishes , Ina . " Cress 's heart sank . " I would n't feel right , not helping , " she said . " Washing them alone , " Mr. Wallenius told her , " is apI79little punishment I planned for Ina . A little reminder . Is n't that true , Ina ? " " Yes , " said Ina , almost under her breath , and went quickly about the clearing up , so Cress could see no polite way of escaping the invitation . Mr. Wallenius put his hat on his head and took from behind the door to the living room a knotted and burly stick . " In case we come across a snake or two , " he said as they went down the kitchen steps . " I enjoy killing those fellows . " This made Cress feel better  --  a walk with a purpose , not just wandering about in the dusk with an almost total stranger . " I killed a rattlesnake once , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stoned it , " said Cress . " I can think of better ways . " So could Cress , but when you were alone and barefoot , what other way was there ? " My father shoots their heads off , " she said . " You find many down there in the groves ? " " Not so many any more , " Cress said . " They slide down the main street here , as much at home as the oldest inhabitants , " Mr. Wallenius said . " I guess they are the oldest inhabitants . They lift their heads up and give you the once-over as they pass by . Maybe I 'll have a chance to show you . " Cress , who had hunted snakes herself and knew howp180scarce they were when looked for , thought the chances for this were slim , though she was too polite to say so . They came out from under the pepper trees , where the air had been hot and close , and turned down a side street . Overhead , the sky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a streak of muddy yellow above the hills to show where the sun had set . At the bottom of the street , they came to a sump hole  --  not one of the big ones , no more than an eye , liquid and dark , reflecting the sky . It shimmered iridescently where water had seeped in with the oil and rose upward here and there in bubbles , as if it were an eye that could breathe as well as see . Mr. Wallenius stirred it a little with the point of his stick , then went off to poke about among the straggling trees and bushes that grew at the sump hole 's upper edges . Sump holes always made Cress uneasy , whether they were large ponds or only small , ragged pools like this one . It seemed unnatural to find a pool of oil instead of water in the ground . This one was stranger than most , because , lying at the foot of a little arroyo down which there was a trickle of water in the winter months , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs growing about it , like a real pond of water . Several birds , having seen the light reflected in it and mistaken it for water and dipping too low , had died there . Dragonflies and moths had darted down to drink and never risen again . It was a very strange place , yet peaceful  --  no sounds except the pumps , the dry , placid singing of insects in the fadedp181grass , and Mr. Wallenius ' quiet poking about in the elder clump . It was half pleasant , half frightening , standing there  --  frightening to think that if she were as easily fooled as a bird or dragonfly , she , too , could plunge in and not come out ; pleasant to think that though she stood on the edge of danger , she was safe because she saw it . " Ah , ha ! " cried Mr. Wallenius . " What did I tell you ? " He came out of the elder clump with a heavy snake hanging across his walking stick . Fearful of falling , the snake balanced itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out so quickly that in the dusk it almost seemed that a vapor came from its mouth . Cress jumped quickly backward as Mr. Wallenius advanced . Then she saw , even in the fading light , that what he had picked up was nothing more than a poor gopher snake that had probably been out hunting a mouse for supper . " It 's nothing but a gopher snake , " she said . " Nothing but a poor , harmless gopher snake . " " A fine fellow , " Mr. Wallenius replied , as if agreeing . " Fat and sassy . I 'll just put him in here to cool off a bit . " Then , with a gentle movement , Mr. Wallenius laid , rather than threw , the soft , brown , harmless thing in the sump hole . Cress could not believe her eyes . So terrible a thing to do ! Involuntarily , she took hold of Mr. Wallenius ' wrist . " It will die , " she told him . " Maybe so , maybe not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sink  --  swim ; sink  --  swim , " he said . " Sink  --  swim . " It was almost as if the snake heard and obeyed . Oilcovered , eyes blinded , tongue motionless , it struggled , it rose and sank , rose and sank . " Sink  --  swim , " said Mr. Wallenius . " Up  --  down ; in  --  out . " Behind the blunt , striving , blinded head making its horribleeffort to rise , yet falling back again , the snake 's body moved with such energy that against anything with less resistance than oil it would have broken free . But the oil held like fingers . Along the whole of her body , Cress felt the terror and effort of that struggle  --  the oil in her own eyes , the taste of oil in her own mouth . " Save him ! " she implored . " Save him ! It 's wicked to do that . It hurts him so ! " " Sink  --  swim , " said Mr. Wallenius . " Sink  --  swim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , then flashed away ; the evening insects sang on ; there was a little flurry of wind among the elder leaves . " Sink  --  swim , " said Mr. Wallenius . " Under  --  out . " The snake 's head lifted and fell ; it kept time , it seemed , not only with the words Mr. Wallenius spoke but with the thud and suck of the pumps and with the rhythmical pressure of Mr. Wallenius ' fingers on Cress 's hand , which she now realized he was holding . " It 's dying ! " Cress cried , her shrill voice disturbing all that orderly time-keeping going on so relentlessly aboutp183the sump hole , and , weeping not only for the snake but for herself , she plunged away from Mr. Wallenius and began , desperately , to run . The last half-mile down the spur line , she walked , and she had stopped crying a mile or so before that . By the time she stood on her own front porch , she had stopped catching her breath , too , and had wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so natural to be there and to see her mother and father sitting by the open window talking , that everything else , the whole visit  --  orderly kitchen , lemon that shone like a light , sweating eggs , snake , sump hole , even Mr. Wallenius  --  seemed objects she might have imagined in the two minutes between stepping outside to see the stars and going back into the house again . But when she opened the screen door , she realized that she had actually been away , for her mother , very startled , jumped from her chair and said , " Why , Cress Delahanty , how on earth do you happen to be here now ? " Cress did n't know what answer to make . It seemed foolish to say , " Because Mr. Wallenius drowned a snake in a sump hole . " She thought of saying , " Because it 's Fated , I guess , " but that was n't true . What had been Fated was for her to spend the night at the Walleniuses ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was homesick , " she finally said . She saw her father and mother look at each other . Her father stood up . " Well , " he said , " I 'm glad you were . Andp184you did n't get here a minute too soon . I was just on the point of putting us together some kind of a bedtime snack . How does that sound to you ? " It sounded good , but Cress was silent . She sat down in her father 's chair and nodded yes to him , because suddenly she was too tired to speak even so small and easy a word.  |p187The  sun blazed , fledglings flew , roses bloomed . Butthere was still , for Southern California , an indication ofa lingering spring : green grass . There had been late rainsand the yellow look had not yet come to the foothills andthe grass in the Delahanty back yard was still Februaryfresh . Now in late afternoon each bent blade carried onits hump a drop of water left over from the middayshower . The low sun , slanting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward thehouse , put her feet down carefully . She was now fourteenyears old and oppressed by the brevity of life , the fugaciousnessof blossoms , and the evanescence of raindrops . Even words like evanescent and fugacious could set up , with their suggestive syllables , delicious tremors of sorrowin her heart . Ending , ending , everything is ending , she thought . In spite of her care , raindrops like emeraldsand diamonds went flying down to nothing as she walked . She was even sorrowful about the box of tin cans she hadjust taken to the stack behind the barn . She had put themdown with benedictory thoughts : finished and done with !  |p188Gone  from the orderly kitchen shelves and the bright lights of the house into the cold earth . There were tears in her eyes as she walked through the grass . She had more feelings than she knew what to do with , more emotions than her tranquil life permitted her to discharge . She had to invent sorrows and concoct dramas . She would stoop down to rejoice with a daffodil that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would loosen a butterfly from a spider web with wailings that brought her no sympathy from any listener . As if she cared for sympathy ! She was capable emotionally of a woman 's tragedies and , up to now , she had been unable to overtake any of these . Now , however , she loved and was not loved in return . No one , not even Calvin Dean , knew anything of this ; though she could not believe it would matter if he did . That was a part of his appeal : his indifference . He did n't know Crescent Delahanty existed . Why should he ? With rubies and emeralds and diamonds transformed by her feet into simple raindrops and the raindrops themselvesshattered into the shapelessness of moisture she thought , I 'm King Midas in reverse . I change jewels to water . I can touch gold and make it into a base metal , lead or tin . She stood ankle deep in the diamonds and rubies she had yet to ruin and figured what her name was . Midas in reverse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the jewels I touch are water and the gold I touch is dust and the people I love hate me . With these thoughts , she went into the kitchen , whichp189was warm and fragrant with the tamale pie her mother was making . Her mother was at the sink shaking olives from a bottle . Cress watched her for a second or two , then said , " I am King Sadim . " Her mother , who did not turn around , asked in a cheerfulvoice , " Who 's King Sadim , dear ? " " King Midas had a brother and Sadim was his name , " Cress said , the relationship coming to her as she spoke . " I never heard of him , " Mrs. Delahanty replied . " I did n't know King Midas had a brother . " " This brother was not popular . He was King Midas in reverse . Everything he touched turned into dust . It may be bad to have everything you touch turn to gold  --  but it 's a lot better than having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadim and everybody tried to forget him . I may be the only person in the world who remembers him . " Her mother , who had the olives out of the bottle , now began to stir them into her pie . She looked up from her stirring with amused interest , as Cress related this bit of unknown mythology . Cress regarded her mother dispassionately . The rain and the steam in the kitchen had made her new permanent too frizzy . There was a big splash of cornmeal mush across her apron . Her lipstick formed a dot at each corner of her mouth . She was smiling quite happily . Happy , Cress thought , on a spring evening of unutterable beauty , with nothing better to do than make a tamale pie . A pie that will be eaten tonight and forgotten tomorrow.  | " Oh , Mother , " she cried . " Poor , poor Mother . " She dug an olive out of the pie and put it into her mouth . Under her closed lids she felt the happy smart of tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the olive seed from her mouth and pushed it deep into the wellwateredsoil about one of the African violet plants which her mother kept in pots along the window sill over the sink . " What are you doing , Cress ? " her mother asked . " Giving it one more chance , " Cress whispered , patting the soil in tenderly over the buried seed . " Giving what one more chance ? " " The olive seed . It had given up . Into the bottle , into the pie , into my mouth . Like Jonah . Then when it thought all was over I spat it up . Rescue . Escape . It will be a tree again . " " It never was a tree , Cress . Any more than an egg ever was a chicken . " " It is an embryonic tree , Mother . It has leaves and limbs locked in its heart . " All those surprising l 's . They brought tears to her eyes , too . " Leave them locked , " Mrs. Delahanty said unfeelingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . I want African violets . " " O.K. , " Cress said , " if that 's the way you feel about it . " She began disinterring the seed . " The choice is yours . Life or Death . You choose Death . " She opened the windowover the sink and flung the olive pit out into thep191April twilight . " Die , " she bade it in a tragic voice . " Cease to be . It is my mother 's wish . " Her mother slid the tamale pie into the oven . " How much death do you think there is in that tamale pie , Mother ? " Cress asked . Her mother looked startled and Cress said , " One cow at the very least . Two maybe . " " Cress , " her mother said , " you have a bad case of spring fever . You need some vitamins or minerals or something . " Death in the world , spring passing , love never coming , and vitamins were recommended . " Do you know it 's spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that will never again be upon this earth ? Never , never , never ? And that it 's the last day on earth a lot of people will ever see ? There , " she said , pointing to the fragment of pale sun still visible through the darkening leaves of the eucalyptus tree , " that sun is going down forever for someone at this very minute . " Something came into her mother 's face , agreement , she was afraid . And she could n't bear agreement or understandingjust now . What she longed for was sorrow and contention , lasting disorder and sudden death . She ran out of the kitchen slamming the door behind her . In her own room she flung herself onto the chair in front of her bamboo desk , put her arms on the open lid of the desk and her face on her arms . " Oh , Calvin , " she whispered . Then , very daringly , " My darling . " The word made a pulse beat on her cheekbone.  |p192She  reached out a hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk was covered . The desk was her dearest possession . She had bought it from the Second Hand Furniture Mart with $11.98 of her own money . It had come to the Furniture Mart from a beach cottage and it still smelled of seaweed and salt water , with an occasional whiff of Djer Kiss and grunnion . Its stork-thin legs were stained and wobbly . It was everywherelightly pocked with what appeared to be old buckshotwounds but which were actually worm holes . She liked it that way . She would not have cared for unscarred varnish fresh from a furniture factory . " Oh , desk , " she said . She felt it was her real home . Once when she was a child , her real home for over a year had been the piano box in which their new piano had come and which had stood out behind the barn . She slept in the house of course and ate there  --  but as a boarder , as a matter of convenience . Her real home was the piano box . She had sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beaded curtain across its opening , and speculated about the people who lived up at the Delahanty house . What kind of people were they ? Did they have any children ? She would have to call on them some day . She could n't get into her desk , of course , as she had the piano box , but it was , in the same way , her home . She sat up now , so vigorously the desk rocked , and took from one of its pigeonholes a fold of adding-machine paper given her by the manager of the Piggly Wiggly store . She unfolded the long strip of paper , looked overp193what was already written there , picked up her pen and began where she had left off : " 39 . I love Calvin Dean . 40 . I love Calvin Dean . 41 . I love Calvin Dean . " When she had written " I love Calvin Dean " one hundred times she intended to fold the paper to the size of a postage stamp and put it in the little chamois bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she would hang this bag around her neck , on a ribbon the right length to keep the words exactly over her heart . She would wear it night and day , in water or out ( wrapped in oiled paper and held in her mouth on these occasions ) . She would never be parted from it ; she would stand in Calvin Dean 's presence , every thud of her heart lifting the words , " I love Calvin Dean , " written one hundred times over , a fraction of an inch nearer him . Surely he would feel it , surely it would influence him . She paused at " 56 . I love Calvin Dean " to think about him . He was eighteen years old , a big ruddy boy , blondhairedand supple . She thought he probably looked like Charlemagne and , like Charlemagne , he seemed born to command . He was the head of everything at school that had a head , from captain of the football team to president of the debating club . Because of Calvin she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on the debating team . She was now first substitute and should any misfortune ever overtake Connie Bielefeldt , Calvin 's partner , she herself would have to debate with Calvin , a possibility so overwhelmingshe tried not to think of it . Her try-out speechp194on the negative side of socialized medicine had been against her conscience , but since every word of it had been the truest cry of her heart , " Calvin see me , Calvin hear me , " it had not been really hypocritical . And Calvin had seen and heard . And momentarily , and partially anyway , he had approved , for he had voted for her as first substitute . Making the debating team had put her nearer Calvin , but this nearness had made her no more happy . His presence was too overwhelming . When the debating club met and Calvin presided she would fix her eyes on the picture of Longfellow which hung at the front of the room to keep from staring at Calvin . At the end of the meeting her eyes would be so tired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she would have to go to the girl 's rest room to bathe them . Once in the middle of a meeting Calvin had stopped the proceedings to address her directly . " Would you mind telling us , " he had asked , " what you see in that picture , anyway ? " " Me ? " she had whispered , nudged by a neighbor from her cultivated inattention . Calvin had turned his back on the debating club to gaze up at Longfellow . Facing Cress again he had said , " I do n't see the likeness myself . " " Oh no , " Cress had explained as the laughter quieted , " I do n't mean I see me in the picture . " And too shaken for anything but the most literal truth she said , " What I mean is I do n't see you . "  |p195Calvin  had given her , at this , his long cold debater 's stare with which he was wont to impress judges and paralyze opponents . " Delahanty , " he said , practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From too shy she had gone to too bold . The desk under her arms shook as she remembered what she had said . Determined to say something and unable to think of anything but synonyms for " crazy " she had rolled them all off : " Crazy , " she had agreed , " demented , mad , irresponsible , tetched , nuts , moonstruck , bats in my belfry , off my trolley , lunatic . . . " If Calvin had not interrupted her she might have gone on indefinitely . " In a word , " he had said , " crazy . " That had been his last word to her : " Crazy . " She picked up her pen and wrote , to forget it , " 57 . I love Calvin Dean . 58 . I love Calvin Dean . " At " 59 . I love  --  , " her mother without a knock or a whistle came into the room . " Studying , Cress ? " she asked . " No , " Cress answered . She did n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . In a way she did not understand , she wished her mother would pick it up , read it , and ask : " What 's the meaning of all this I love Calvin Dean , ' Cress ? " Then she would answer , tell her everything , say : " The meaning is , I love Calvin Dean and he does n't know I exist except to think I 'm crazy . " It would be an excuse , if her mother picked it up , to tell her everything , of all the miseries of her life . How sad it was to die and to be a debater and to love the most outstanding boy in schoolp196and to destroy emeralds and diamonds . Tell her and ask her , " What 's the matter with me ? Why am I so sad and miserable ? Why do I turn things into dust ? " But her mother , very honorably averted her eyes from the list and asked , diffidently : " I do n't suppose you 'd want to ride into town with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it be only last fall  --  when she would have been the first one out in the car at that invitation . But it was a dream-like time , vanished , rememberedlike a dream . " No , " she said . " Thanks just the same , but I guess not . " Her mother lingered . Finally she said , " If your mind 's made up I wo n't urge . Keep your eye on the tamale pie , will you ? " Then , as if she had perhaps been too quick to accept Cress 's refusal she turned back from the door . " Oh come on , Cress . It 's a beautiful evening . We 're just going in and back . Your father has to pick up something from the garage for the tractor . We wo n't be gone a minute . The tamale pie can take care of itself . Come on . " " No , " Cress said , " I guess not . " " You used to love trips to town . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not tonight . " " Want us to bring you anything ? " " There 's nothing I want you can buy . " " O.K. , " her mother said . " Good-by then . We 're going as soon as your father washes up . " When the door closed she began her writing again.  | " 59 . I love Calvin Dean . 6o . I love Calvin Dean . 61 . I love Calvin Dean . " Her pen , as she remembered momentarilythose trips to town , faltered . There was first of all the pleasure of the change from the quiet of the ranch to the movement and noise of the city . After a week at the ranch storekeepers , carrying in at closing time the baskets of yams and cabbages from the sidewalk , seemed exciting . They would bulge out their white-aproned stomachsto form a shelf on which to rest a lug of tomatoes . They would call out to passers-by : " Have n't seen you for a coon 's age , " or " How 's tricks ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take short housewifelysteps , and the pencils behind their ears would tremble a little . She remembered the library , empty usually at this time of everyone but herself , the librarian and two old men reading papers , the four of them sealed away from the world among the books , a spell of silence put upon them forever . She remembered the hollow engulfed-cathedral echo of the six o'clock chimes from the Presbyterian church as it was absorbed and deadened by the rows of books . She remembered the trip home from town , the library books on the back seat ( among them perhaps the best book of her life ) . She remembered the hot buttered popcornwhich the three of them ate while they speculated about the people , fragments of whose lives were revealed to them through their lighted windows . Remembering all these pleasures they did not , after all , seem past . Theyp198were pleasure and they were hers right now for the taking . She ran out of her room , down the hall , and through the dining room crying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just backing out of the driveway and she ran ontothe side porch shouting , " Wait for me . I 've changed my mind . " But she was too late . They did n't hear her . The car rolled smoothly away without a sign from either of them . They were laughing and talking , with not the least memory it appeared of her . No one looking at them would guess that they were driving off , leaving their only child alone while they went merrymaking . She went back into the empty house , into her empty room , and there without bothering to sit down , picked up her pen and wrote " 62 . I love Calvin Dean . " What was she doing standing at her bamboo desk , writing " I love you " one hundred times to a boy who did n't know she existed ? She was suddenly alone , not only in the house , but in the world . " I am alone in the world , " she said and the words had a terrible ring of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great lover of signs and portents  --  the summer she was fourteen , when everything was changing . Signs and portents did n't stop the changes , did n't even slow them down , but they did forewarn her . That was something . It was something to know that if you laughed before breakfast you would cry before supper , that Friday would be either the fairest or the foulest day of the week , that a pointed elbow is the certain sign of a sour disposition , and that a sweating glass brings rain . Cress started her days that summer by counting buttons and ended them by counting one-eyed autos . One-eyed autos were called padiddles that summer , no one knew why . In between times , she counted white horses , loads of hay , tea leaves , bridges , beards , and mules . She wished on falling stars , over running water , and upon making accidentalrhymes . " Spit , " she yelled at her father when a jack rabbit ran in front of their car . Mr. Delahanty had learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , having spat .  | " We 'd been sure to 've had a blowout if you had n't . " Cress was shocked when her mother threw half of a too large pinch of salt into the sink . " All the salt you throw away , " Cress told her mother , " you have to come back after you 're dead and pick up with your eyelashes . " Mrs. Delahanty rinsed away the salt that still remained on her hand . " Cress , " she asked , " you do n't really believe all this nonsense , do you ? " Wary as a witch doctor , Cress replied , " Why take a chance ? " and continued her propitiations . That was the summer Cress saw Honor Gallagher again after Honor had been away a year , a meeting that did n't surprise Cress . Had n't it been foretold ? Had n't she dropped the dishcloth , dreamed of running water , and the day she saw Honor said her name not once but twice before eating ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightfall as a greeting . The day she saw Honor again was a Monday , the day after the Fourth of July . Cress came to breakfast late and sat looking at her orange juice , not drinking it . After a day at the beach , she felt too passive and dreamy to eat , even to drink . " Mother , " she said , " is it O.K. with you if I go swimming in the Ditch this afternoon ? " The Ditch , which carried irrigation water to the orange groves , was nicer than it sounded , shoulder deep , widep201as a narrow road , curving among the glossy-leaved trees . " I do n't know how you can stand any more water , Crescent , " her mother said . Mrs. Delahanty 's face , except for large white circles about her eyes , where her sunglasseshad protected her , was raspberry-colored , and when she spoke , she tried to move her mouth as little as possible . Cress admired this way of talking . She thought it made her mother look a little like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a good , solid name , " Cress said , " instead of Crescent . " " What do you mean , good and solid ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " Old-fashioned , " Cress explained . " Like Faith or Abigailor Prudence . " " I once knew a girl named Abundance , " Mr. Delahanty said . Mr. Delahanty , being dark , did n't sunburn and was able to speak heartily . " How 'd you like that for a name , Cress ? " " Who did you ever know named Abundance ? " asked Mrs. Delahanty , stiff-lipped . She had been brought up in the same town as her husband and thought she knew all the girls he knew . " Bunny Evans , " Mr. Delahanty said . " So Bunny Evans ' name was Abundance . " Mrs. Delahantysounded thoughtful . " I never knew that . " " Abundance is just as bad as Crescent , " Cress said . " It 's too unusual . My favorite name is Honor . I think it 's the most distinguished name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty . Beforep202Honor had gone with her parents to Alaska , she had lived on a ranch adjoining the Delahantys ' and had been , in spite of the five years ' difference in their ages , Cress 's best friend . " Honor is a nice name , " Mrs. Delahanty said . " But I like Crescent better . It 's more romantic . " " Honor , " Cress said , " is solid and romantic . " Then she drank her orange juice . The first thing Cress heard from the other girls when she got to the Ditch that afternoon was that Honor Gallagher was back on a visit . Cress had n't had any letters from Honor recently . Not that that mattered . After a lifetime of silence , it would still be the same between her and Honor . " Honor and her mother got here Saturday , " one of the girls said . " They 're visiting Honor 's grandmother , in town . They 've bought a new car and are going to drive it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How wonderful ! " But all the time she was floating away from the others , slowly at first , then faster , around two bends , under Byfield Bridge , past the clump of acacias , until , finally , she was alone and , if missed , not missed enough to be shouted at by anyone or pursued . She drifted on , floating on her back , and overhead a white cloud like an opened parasol accompanied her . A speckle-backed lady-bug , riding a faded cottonwood leaf , went with her downstream . The cloud blotted out the sun , and the water was the color of ap203butcher-knife blade ; the sun came out and the blade was first polished , then changed from steel to silver . Cress rescued the traveling lady-bug , set her ashore , then anchoredherself by an overhanging bank where slanting willows shaded the water . The water was high . It ran over the grass of the bank , extending it full length , so that it looked like soft , green hair being combed . The shouts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer human voices but only summery , afternoon sounds . And there were no other sounds at all , except the faraway drone of a tractor endlessly crisscrossing an orchard . Cress listened and then suddenly began to thrash about , to beat her feet up and down in the water , to squeeze herself as if what she wanted was to be wrung dry . The hair-like grass was washed every which way , and the water , slapping against the bank , was muddied . Then Cress made herself sink to the stream 's white , sandy bottom . She opened her eyes underwater and looked at a transformed world . " Honor is home , " she thought . It was at the Ditch that she had first met Honor Gallagher , two years before , the summer she was twelve and Honor seventeen . Cress had been practicing floating then . She could swim but not float . Sinking , as she always did , she looked up and saw a girl in a yellow bathing suit looking down at her from the bank above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her said , and Cress did so and floated . Honor was one of the big girls , full grown , one of thep204girls Cress had watched from a distance . She had a shape , beautiful , in and out like a flower on a stem . But she was hardy , too , like a boy . There were strong , swelling musclesin her brown legs and arms . When she tautened herself for a dive , two cords stood out in her rounded throat , like cables , like ropes . Her yellow bathing suit was in one piece , not two wisps , like most of the big girls ' , with vacanciesfor their bodies to show through . She wore her hair short , turned up all over her head , like waves just ready to break but pausing . Her mouth was pretty . She chewed rose petals lots of times , or sucked nasturtiums for honey , or ate sour grass . She was interested in the tastes of things . " Eyes of gold and bramble-dew , " Cress had quoted to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Honor could swear like a trooper . She was the only girl in the Gallagher family , with older boys on one side of her , younger boys on the other . It was a tussle to stay alive in the midst of them , she used to say . That first afternoon , she had dived down into the Ditch beside Cress . It takes pains and practice to dive into four feet of water . You can go too straight and break your neck , or flatten out too much and break yourself wide open . Honor went just right  --  under , then up , in a shallow arc . She had been with the big kids on a swimming party , but it had become a necking party , so she 'd left . She stood up in the Ditch , water running down her fierce , pink face . " Those boys ! So pinchy , so squeezy ! " She opened and closed the fingers of one hand to show what she meant , then dived under again , as if to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for a whole year on Saturdays , Sundays , and after school . At first , Cress thought she was too young to be Honor 's friend and was apologetic . But Honor liked her as she was . " You 're not lovey-dovey , " she said once . Well , she had been , really , as far as Honor was concerned , but what Honor meant was that she was n't lovey-dovey about the boys . She and Honor had been perfect together . That summer , they had discovered a shallow cave  --  a ledge with a roof over it , actually , in the hills . There was clean sand on the bottom , two bones  --  human or animal , neither of them knew which  --  at the cave 's edge , and a view , on clear days , of the ocean . Cress and Honor had gone there that summer at every hour  --  at sunrise , at sunset , in between . They had imagined , sitting in the cave , that they were the last of the world 's survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon , they had wondered how long it would be before the ocean gnawed inland to them . At other times , they 'd imagined themselves to be the first human beings , or visitors from Mars , ignorant of all but their cave and speculating as to what the distant , flashing blue of the Pacific might be . They had often made fires in their cave and cooked food  --  hot dogs , usually . Sometimes they had a real meal  --  roasted potatoes and onions to go with their hot dogs , and served Hostess cupcakes for dessert . Honor had been memorizing the records of all outstandingbatters and pitchers that first summer . She car/ried with her a small , loose-leaf spiral notebook , a Beacon Wire-o , in which she kept these figures , in her sharpedged , vertical writing . She would bring her notebook to the cave and get Cress to test her knowledge . " Why memorize them ? " Cress asked her once . " The mind is a muscle , " Honor answered . " I want to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want to guess , I want to know what Lefty Gomez did and the year he did it . " Cress had n't cared much about Lefty Gomez , but she had n't been able to help learning about him that summer . What she really liked was poetry . She brought an anthology , " Star Points , " to the cave , but it was Honor who did all the reading aloud . She could read so much better than Cress , who got carried away by the rhythm and was soon todo-todoing like a player piano . What the words meant was always vivid and clear to Honor , to whom poetry , and even much reading , was new . When she said " stone , " the stone would be in her voice , almost in the shape of her mouth ; you would imagine you heard it click against her teeth . When Cress and Honor were not together , they left notes for each other at the Delahanty weir box , which they both passed on their way to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , would find a note put there by Cress the night before , and Cress , at eight-thirty , would pick up a note left there by Honor a half hour before . Honor 's notes had been brief andp207businesslike : " See you tonight 5 P.M. Good luck in Geog. test . H. G. " Cress 's had been a good deal more flowery . Sometimes she had quoted poetry , sometimes made up some . Once only she had written , " I love you . Crescent Delahanty . " Cress had never known what Honor did with her notes . Threw them away , probably ; Honor was n't sentimental . Cress kept all of Honor 's , though  --  she had them yet , in a candy box that looked like a little cedar chest , brass bands , nailheads , and all . When Honor 's father , who , Mr. Delahanty said , was a rolling stone if ever there was one , decided to roll on to Alaska after a year in California , Cress and Honor parted without any schoolgirl protestations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , Cress thought now as she floated quietly beneath a sky that was empty of clouds , had the sound of names that belonged together : Honor , Crescent  --  Crescent , Honor . One solid , square , an unchanging rock , the other curving , filled with light , but a reflected light . Cress was in no great hurry to get home that afternoon . What was the need to rush ? Honor would come as soon as she could . She would have to do a certain amount of visiting with her grandmother and other relatives in town ; then she would drive out . Cress floated and remembered and dreamed . When , at last , she started home , the sun was low ; midges rose and fell above the yellowing roadsideweeds . Because she had been in the water so long , her body felt curiously light , washed thin . She was happyp208about Honor 's return , but not excited , she thought . Then , when she saw the new yellow car in the driveway , she knew it was Honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch when Cress got there , no one in the living room . She walked into the dining room , paused , and called , " Honor ! Honor ! " Mrs. Delahanty came in from the kitchen , wiping her hands on a paper towel . In the shadowy room , her face , which had been almost purple that morning , looked only rosy . " Cress ? " she said . " Honor 's out in the orchard with your father . " This seemed strange . Honor had never been one to fall in with the boring trips of inspection suggested by grownups . " She wanted to help him pick out some fruit to send back to Alaska , " Mrs. Delahanty explained . " Some avocadosand grapefruit , and oranges , too , I guess . She wants them to be absolutely perfect . " This was strange , too . Honor had never cared about what she ate . A burned hot dog tasted good to her ; she would eat the worm with the apple , if not warned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Cress said . " You 'd probably just meet them on their way back , " Mrs. Delahanty said to her . " Why do n't you go brush your hair and put on a clean dress instead ? Honor 's all dressed up . After all , it 's a holiday , you know . " Mrs. Dela/hanty reached out a hand to smooth Cress 's hair , which had dried into stiff , finger-width strands . Cress put on a clean white dress and her new white moccasins , combed her hair , and tied it at the back with a blue ribbon . By the time she had finished , she heard her father 's voice and knew that he and Honor had returned from the orchard . The three of them were sitting about the table when she went into the dining room , a little pyramid of oranges in front of them . Her father was beginning to peel an orange in the methodical way he had , cutting the top off first with his knife . " Honor , " Cress said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressing the second syllable of " hello " in a way that was new to her . " How are you , anyway ? " " I 'm all right , " Cress said . Honor was as beautiful as ever . She had on one of those dresses in two parts , the parts not meeting  --  a short , tight bodice and a full , swirling skirt . The dress was apricot-colored , and between the bodice and skirt Honor 's brown skin was smooth and supple . " Your mother said you were swimming , " Honor remarkedpolitely . " Do you still like to swim ? " " Yes , I do , " Cress answered . " I love to . Do you still swim , Honor ? " " Oh , no , " Honor answered . " No , not any more . " There was a pause in which no one said anything . Then Mrs.p210Delahanty said in an interested voice , " I expect you go skiing nowadays , do n't you , Honor ? " " Yes , " Honor answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting I just ca n't tell you . It 's the nearest thing to flying , they say . " " I was up at Arrowhead at Christmas , " Cress said . " I was n't much good on skis , but I tried . " Honor laughed , shook her head , and then spoke to Mrs. Delahanty . " She has n't changed , has she ? " I 'm right here , Cress thought . You can speak to me , Honor . But Honor went on talking to her mother . Honor , though always polite to older people , used to squirm when Mrs. Delahanty cornered her for five minutes ' conversation . Now she was the one who was doing the talking and Mrs. Delahanty the listening . Here I am , Honor , Cress thought , but it was like those movies in which an invisible person tries to communicate with someone . Honor could n't see her , could n't hear her voice . She sat near enough to Honor to touch her , but she could n't do that ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could see through but could n't understand and could n't possibly break . Mr. Delahanty handed an orange to Honor . " Eat this and see what you 've been missing , " he told her . Honor began to peel the orange with her old-time quick , sure gestures . " These are really going to amaze Mike , Mr. Delahanty . I do n't think he 's ever eaten a tree-ripened orange in his life . " Cress looked inquiringly not at Honor but at her mother.  | " Honor 's engaged to Mike , dear , " her mother said . " Engaged ? " Cress asked , as if it were a word she had never heard . " To be married , " Honor said , smiling , popping the first section of her orange into her mouth . " When was it you said the wedding was to be ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " In September . If Mike gets his leave then . " " Is Mike a soldier ? " Cress asked . " Oh , no , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a commercialflier , but he was in the Army so long he always thinks of vacations as leaves , and so do I , now . " " Two months ! " Mrs. Delahanty exclaimed . " That 's not long , is it ? " " No , it 's really terribly soon , " Honor said . " That 's the reason Mother and I are down here , actually . To buy me some clothes and get some household equipment . You have an electric stove , do n't you , Mrs. Delahanty ? Do you think I should get one ? " " I would n't have anything else , " Mrs. Delahanty said . " Does yours have its oven and broiler together ? " " Mine does , yes . " " Mike says that would n't be too satisfactory . Say you want hot biscuits and a broiled steak at the same time , for instance . How do you manage that ? " " Mike seems to be pretty informed about cooking , " Mr. Delahanty observed . " Oh , Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , Mr. Delahanty . Not just cooking  --  everything . " " And you 're going to see that he gets steak and hot biscuits together  --  this wonder man ? " Mr. Delahanty asked . " Yes , I am , " Honor said , refusing to be teased , " if I have to have a stove made to order . " " Why do n't you come look at mine ? " Mrs. Delahanty suggested . " It 's not new , but it 's pretty good , I think . " The two women  --  ' that was how Cress thought of them now  --  went out of the room together , and Cress and her father were left alone . " Sit down , Cress , why do n't you ? " Mr. Delahanty said . Cress pulled out one of the chairs from the table and sat down beside her father . It was a nice time of the day , cool after heat , a breeze , newly sprung up , moving the white curtains , enough light yet to put shadows onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Delahanty said , rolling one toward her . Cress automatically cupped her hand to keep the orange from rolling off the table . She did n't pick it up but moved it back and forth , feeling the warmth that was still in it after a day in the sun . On the table beside the oranges was a card , which said , " Michael J. Gates , Gates 's Flying Service , Anchorage , Alaska , Box 1713 . " " Is that his name ? " Cress asked . " Gates ? " Mr. Delahanty nodded . " It 's the address for the fruit . " " How terrible ! " Cress said . " How terribly unlucky ! " " Unlucky ? " Mr. Delahanty asked  | " Change the name and not the letter , Change for worse and not for better , " Cress explained . But the minute she said the words , Cress knew they did n't matter , and that she would as soon walk under a ladder , throw salt away , put on her left shoe first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these prophesyings ! They were nothing . They were child 's play . Countings and wishings and spittings were not going to change anything . In the kitchen she could hear Honor saying , " I should think this deep-well cooker would be pretty economical . " Mr. Delahanty smiled across at her . " There 's a calmeddowntomboy for you , " he said . " And I suppose it wo n't be long before you 're thinking of steaks and stoves . And Edwin , " he added thoughtfully . " How 's Edwin , " he asked . " I have n't heard you mention him for some time ? " Cress began slowly to peel her orange . She could not think of Edwin now . She could not think ahead to any coming time , only backward to the summer she had first seen Honor and to the summer that for her was already over , the summer of signs and portents.  |p214Cress  sat a little removed from Yolande Perrotti and Yolande 's boy friend , waiting for the magic of the house party to bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she had imagined it , were present : the sea and a boy . And though the Pacific , with its waves shattering from glass to foam and from green to white , was behaving as she had expected , Yolande and her boy friend were not . The boy had come up out of the breakers fifteen minutes ago to join Yolande , and Cress had waited , at first excitedly , then unhappily , for the introduction which never came . Now , magic postponed for a while longer , she lay back on the sand which , though it shimmered warmly with a thousand reflected lights off the broken sea , was cold and clammy to the touch . She put an arm across her eyes and excluded the sight of those who were excluding her . This was the first day of the house party ; in fact , at nine in the morning , almost its first hour . For though they had arrived at the beach at dusk the night before , that flurry of unpacking , of eating peanut-butter sandwiches and making beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , " any more than the arranging of a stage is called a  |p2I5|play  . So perhaps it was too early to judge or condemn the house party because it was so unlike the house party she had imagined , or the girls had planned . Or even the house party her mother had feared . Though all of these parties  --  the planned , the imagined , and the feared  --  were alike in one respect : what was most important in all of them had never been mentioned by anyone . It had taken Cress two weeks to persuade her mother to let her go to the house party at all . At first , Mrs. Delahantyhad said no because of Cress 's age . At fourteen , she said , a girl was too young to go to a house party . Cress had countered this by naming a dozen fourteen-year-olds she knew who had gone to house parties . Mrs. Delahanty , at that , had shifted her ground . Fourteen might not be too young if the other girls were fourteen . But if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of that Perrotti girl , seventeen , Cress would be out of her depth , expected to know what she did not know , and interested in what did n't interest her ; and she would hence have a miserable , disillusioning time . To this Cress had replied that she saw the five housepartygirls every day at school , that they were all interested in the same things ( what these were she had not said ) and that she was never uncomfortable or out of her depth with them . Mrs. Delahanty had then changed her tack . She had become very practical . Cress , with her fair skin and no one to look after her , would surely have one of her terrible cases of sunburn . And indigestion . Many a womanp216she knew traced her chronic indigestion to girlhood follies in eating . And where were these follies more practiced than at house parties ? " Dill pickles ! Potato chips ! Cracker Jack ! " " Cracker Jack , " Cress had echoed with real astonishment , " I 've never tasted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've heard of me , " Mrs. Delahanty had replied shortly . " Mother , I assure you Cracker Jack is no hazard , " Cress had answered . Sidetracked , Mrs. Delahanty had then retorted , " Hazard , Cress . I did n't say it was a hazard . I said . . . " But she had seen through the sidetracking technique . " Cracker Jack is beside the point . Conglomerations of food at odd hours . " " You forget Miss Bird , " Cress had said . Miss Bird was to be their chaperone . She was an aunt of Maribeth Dufour 's , whose idea the house party was . " Oh yes , " Mrs. Delahanty had replied . " The biology teacher . " " And biology is about food , " Cress had said , arranging biology to fit her needs . " Miss Bird probably has lists of balanced meals already made out and ready for us to follow . " Mrs. Delahanty had left off talking about indigestion at that . " What I really worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by without my reading of a drowningor two at a house party . "  | " Miss Bird is a wonderful swimmer . She is a little lame and ca n't go hiking or anything . So she swims . " " Like Byron , " Mrs. Delahanty had said , unexpectedly . And then , in spite of the fact that Byron was surely the last person to hit on as a suitable chaperone for a girl 's house party , she added , " I must say Miss Bird sounds like the perfect chaperone . " That was exactly the light in which Maribeth had presentedher aunt . " Aunt Iris , " she had assured the girls , " is practically a prefabricated chaperone . The minute she gets to the beach she will put on a kind of divided skirt outfit she has had since 1920 and which she has since shortened some , but not much . And she will sally forth with her specimen case to hunt marine specimens and we will scarcely ever see Aunt Iris again . She will , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Maribeth had said this , had been eating lunch together in the high school cafeteria . Cornelia Samms , at whose parents ' beach cottage the house party was to be held , had looked at Maribeth over a spoonfulof trembling lime jello and asked , " Free for what , Maribeth ? " Everyone but poor Cornelia had known the answer to this question . They would be free for the word no one spoke . Cress had squirmed because of Corny 's ignorance . And because Corny 's question had demonstrated so perfectlywhy Cornelia was so lucky in possessing parents who owned beach and mountain cottages they were willing for Corny 's friends to use . But Maribeth , without squirmingp218and with her famous wide-open , violet-eyed stare unclouded , had answered , " Oh , free for whatever you like , Corny . Who am I to say what that is ? Swimming in the nude , maybe . " She had suggested this in her off-hand , flattering way , as if Corny were an unpredictable and daringscamp . Corny , at that , had clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school to her matronly bosom , as if Maribeth 's suggestion had already undressed her . " Oh , Maribeth , " she had breathed , whistling a little , as she did when excited , because there was a gap between her two front teeth . " I would n't think of such a thing . " " It was just a suggestion , Cornelia . The point is , with Aunt Iris for chaperone we 'll be free . For whatever we want . " And she and all the girls except Corny had looked at each other with understanding . What they 'd be free for was boys . That was the unsaid word and the whole point of the house party as everyone except Corny well understood . Cress , damp and cold where the sand touched her , dry and cold where the wind blew across her , thought about that freedom and the way she was using it . Yolande and her boy friend were counting waves to see if every seventh wave was , as people said , the biggest . Listening , Cress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite naturally into the conversation : Was n't the big seventh wave a shepherd herding six small sheep aheadp219of him ? She took her arms from across her face , then put them back without speaking . After all Yolande had n't introducedher . Even after her mother had said that Cress could go to the house party she had kept asking about it . Yesterday morning , though that seemed years ago now , her mother had brought orange juice in to her , and had sat on her bed while she drank it . " Just exactly who are these girls you are going with , Cress ? " she had asked . " Well , they are the school leaders , " Cress had answered , a little uncertain as to where to start in her descriptions . " Are they your friends ? " " Why , Mother ! Of course they are . Maribeth  --  " " Maribeth I know . Likewise Cornelia . And I 've heardall about Yolande I care to . But who is this Mavis Avis ? " " Mavis Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Avis Davis . " " Mavis and Avis ! " Mrs. Delahanty had repeated . " You would n't think parents could do that to children they loved . " Privately , Cress believed that parents had a blind spot about their children 's names . She had heard a few remarksherself about the unsuitability of Crescent . But all she had said was , " But Mother , they 're twins , identical twins . They dress exactly alike , except for jeweled initial pins . That 's so they can tell themselves apart . It doesn'tp220matter to anyone else , since they 're exactly the same . Mavis and Avis Davis ! Those names really mesmerize me . " " I can see they do , " Mrs. Delahanty had agreed . Cress had defended herself . " It 's not just their names . They 're the school yell leaders . They 've trained themselves to talk in absolute unison like Jack Benny 's Sportsmen . It 's terrifically uncanny . " Mrs. Delahanty had made a sound in her throat . " In private conversation , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . " How can you stand them , Cress ? Talking together that way ? " her mother had asked . Actually , although Cress had not known it yesterday morning , when answering her mother 's questions , the twins , when separated from their official duties as yell leaders and drum majorettes , had almost nothing to say . Cress slept with Mavis . Aunt Iris had separated the twins because she believed it would help develop independence in them . Last night 's separation had not helped Mavis much , Cress thought , since Mavis had spoken only twice and had both times said the same thing . " That goes double for me . " Though this was , perhaps , an advance , since when together they stood like statuary in their identical dresses and stared out from under their identically cut black bangs with their gray duplicating eyes and once in a while , but not very often , said something in unison the way twin statues would , if wired to speak . Maribeth had declared when the house-party guest list was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beach couldn'tp221help noticing them . Cress had been unwise enough to repeatthis to her mother . " People ? " Mrs. Delahanty had repeated . " People ? " For a minute the unsaid word of everybody 's house party was on the verge of being spoken . For what Mrs. Delahantyhad almost said of course was " boys . " " Boys , " not " people , " would notice the house-party girls with the twins along ; and what the girls would be free for , with Aunt Iris as chaperone , would be boys . Boys would see them as they tossed their shining , newly shampooed hair in great exaggerated arcs after they took off their bathing caps ; and boys would hear them when they ran back into the water , shouting and splashing . And boys would see them again , when they came out of the water and stood drying themselves with gestures slower and more deliberate than necessary in the slanting afternoon sun . And they would not only be seen , they would see . They would see the big athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern California Interscholastic Tennis Champion who lived at Balboa Beach . They would notice out of the corners of their eyes the showy handstands of these boys and their professional stance on the surfboards , as they came racing shoreward on the crests of the largest breakers . They would see the non-athletes , too  --  the presidents of student bodies and the commissioners of activities , the boys in flowered shorts and horn-rimmed spectacles , who would organize softball games and blow up rubber horses . They would also notice , or she would anyway , the boys of slighter build , quietp222boys , neither athletes nor executives , who swam as if they liked the feel of water and picked up handfuls of sand and watched it trickle between their fingers with the sunshinegilding it . And one of these boys , his black hair dried in starfish points , and a sweater hung over his shoulders to protect his sunburn , would be somebody 's cousin or brother 's friend or ex-classmate ; and he , after being introduced , and a little talk to everyone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her direction and say to her alone , " Can you always tell when it 's Sunday , because there 's a Sunday shine in the air ? " Something really personal , and about which they two alone would have any knowledge . And after that , a private world , like a great bubble , would settle down over the two of them . When Yolande 's friend had come up out of the water , Cress had thought for a minute that he was going to be this boy of the Sunday shine and the private world . But now he was leaving  --  without a shell , or even a word , tossed to her . Just before supper Cress had to listen , once more , to the story of how this boy had come up out of the water to talk to her and Yolande and how she , mum as an oyster , had left to Yolande the whole burden of entertaining him . The girls , with Aunt Iris , were in the solarium , a big glasswalledroom facing the sea . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was changing back to morning 's green ; though there were white caps now which made it look littered and untidy ,  |p223like  the beach itself , with its forgotten towels and stragglingbathers . The low sun shone through the thinned top of the breakers , coloring them , as they broke , the pink of a raspberry soda ; the nastiest pink in the world , Cress thought , waiting for the final , and by now familiar , line of Yolande 's story . She looked away from the sea to the room . Aunt Iris faced her at the other end of the big window , her head inclined over an old copy of Scientific American , unaware , it appeared , of anything but what she was reading . She had changed from her khaki divided-skirt costume to a soft rose-colored silk and she had pinned a rhinestone butterflyto her thick gray braids and tucked an embroidered handkerchief under the edge of her belt so that the embroideredcorner protruded festively , like a flower . The twins , in T-shirts and short white pleated drum majorette skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway , dip , dip , dip , leap . But their faces , turned toward Yolande , reflected the meaning of Yolande 's words : what a crazy girl Cress is . Maribeth , on the arm of Yolande 's chair , was openly laughing . Only Corny , in a white dress that made her look all the plumper , appeared sympathetic , thinking , Cress believed , there except for the grace of God go I. " This boy , " Yolande went on , " was a complete and absolute stranger to me . But after he left , do you know what Cress said to me ? " They most certainly did . Yolande had told them at least twice before , and Cress , seeing that she was goingp224to tell them once again , looked out at the sea and tried , stoically , to count waves . " After he left , " Yolande said , her voice as shocked with disbelief as if she had never repeated Cress 's words before , " she said , Yolande , why did n't you introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " she asked , hooting with laughter . " Anything so childish ? Thinking I would n't talk to him if I did n't know him ? " Maribeth , holding her stomach to keep her laughs from shaking her too much , called across to Cress . " Oh , Cress , not really ? " Yolande saved Cress from answering . " Yes , yes , she really did . Honest , can you imagine anything so naive ? " Yolande and Maribeth laughed for a long time . The twins , landing in a semi-split after a leap , said together , " Rah , rah-rah . Fight ' em , fight ' em , fight ' em . " Cornelia , face down , pleated her full white skirt . Cress counted meager waves , seconds and thirds and fourths , it looked like , though far out in the greening , plum-colored water she saw a big one forming . Aunt Iris put down the Scientific American and struggledin her slow heavy way up from her chair . Do n't defendme , Cress thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am and make them all hate me . Aunt Iris did n't . All she said was , " I do n't know about you girls , but I 'm hungry . " And she led them to the diningroom . After supper it was as if the girls had never avoided the word boys , as if the boy who had come up out of thep225sea had been a sign to them to talk and speculate . They had planned to go to a movie , but they went back to the solarium , instead , and there in the summery darkness , without bothering to turn on the lights , they began to wonder and to gossip . They perched on chair arms , cloudy , moth-like in their light flimsy dresses ; or lay on the floor ( the twins ) immobile and , with their tunic skirts and long solid legs , looking now like Greek statuary fallen ; though once in a while two legs , Avis ' left and Mavis ' right , were simultaneously lifted at right angles to their bodies , thus spoiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Iris had used to support her lame leg ( Aunt Iris herself had taken the Scientific American and gone to her room ) and watched the green-silver phosphorescence which occasionally smoked at a wave 's tip and , further out , the single bobbing red light of a boat moving slowly across the horizon . A couple went by on the sand below the solarium windows , singing " Fight On for Old U.C. , " to which someone out of sight ( a boy ) yelled , " Give ' em the ax . " The talk was mostly Yolande 's and Maribeth 's , with questions now and then from Corny . They talked of what boys were like , really , and how they were different from girls , and what they liked in girls , really . " Looks are not so important , " Yolande said in her clear contralto , which sounded , Cress thought , like a large bell lightly rung . But it was easy for Yolande with her gypsy princess face to belittle looks . Maribeth said , " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a wonderful figure , " Corny said mournfully . Corny had n't any figure at all , not even a bad one . Cress , hoping a plain fact could n't be considered naive , said , " Mindy Jackson has n't got either . " And everyone knew Mindy was the most popular girl-with-boys in school . Mavis , speaking by herself ( perhaps Aunt Iris ' theory about separation and independence was right ) said , " It 's a complete mystery . " Yolande corrected her . " It 's chemistry , " she said , in a dreamy voice , " pure chemistry . " Maribeth agreed . " Either you have it , or you do n't . " " Is it all settled when you 're born ? " Corny asked , as if her fate hung in the balance . " I expect so , Corny , " Yolande answered cheerfully , giving her long earrings a clink , like an echo to the bell of her voice . " Some girls have the kind of chemistry only one boy reacts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What happens if a girl with ten per cent chemistry meets a boy with one hundred per cent chemistry ? " Corny wanted to know . " She 's lucky , " Yolande said promptly . " Are there many boys like that ? " Cress asked . " No , thank goodness , " Maribeth said . The last of day was now gone but there was enough light from stars or moon , or reflected off the sea to show Yolande 's slow white smile . " I would n't say that , Maribeth , " she said . Then beforep227Maribeth , or anyone else could answer , she broke the spell by flicking on the lamp at her elbow . " It 's only eightthirty , " she said . " Let 's go to the second show . " They came home from the show , an old Alan Ladd movie , with their eyes full of rippling muscles and smokingguns . " Anybody sleepy ? " Yolande asked . No one was . " Anyone hungry ? " Maribeth wanted to know . Everyonewas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : cocoa and sugar with just enough cream to make it spreadable . They ate it on thick slices of heavily buttered French bread and washed it down with CocaCola . It was very invigorating and after eating everyone felt peppy . The twins led them in a - drum- majorette routine . Cress did handstands . Yolande sang a French song . They had a contest to see who could drink a whole coke without taking a breath . They had another contest to see who , with a bottle of coke shaken to the exploding point , could hit the most distant target . At midnight , Aunt Iris , in a flowered challis dressing gown , stepped into the hall that opened into the kitchen and said , " Save something for tomorrow , girls . " In their own room Cress and Mavis sat on their twin Hollywood beds . Cress felt boiling with life , as if there were more blood in her veins than her veins could hold , and more veins in her body than her body could contain . She felt , as she sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and its glories were about to be spread before her and their deepest meanings made clear . Only tonight , the book was her life , not just the imaginings of some writer , and somewhere , outside this room , a new page was waiting to be turned . Outside was the summer night and the stars with their jabbing lights and the sea , whose booming she felt as a pulse inside her head rather than as sound . And only seven blocks away dance bands were playing and cars were drawing up to the curb , laden with people for whom the night was just beginning . She could see it all very clearly . The skin was tight across her cheekbones , and her lips felt strong and curling , simply with the excitement of being alive . There was no use trying to tell from Mavis ' expressionwhat she felt , but at least she did n't look sleepy . Cress jumped off her twin Hollywood bed and went and stood over Mavis . " Oh , Mavis , " she implored , " let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moldering . Let 's . . . " But she did n't know what let 's do . Only let 's get up , move , go outside , stay awake , give the world and the night a chance . But Mavis knew . Perhaps she was not a talker but she knew what to do . " Let 's go get the Samms ' boat , " she said , " and row on the bay . " " Yes , " Cress said . " Oh yes . That will be perfect . Let 's row till sunup . " The Samms kept a rowboat tied up alongside their big cabin cruiser , a little white rowboat named " Cornelia "  |p229and  Cress felt disloyal to Corny , slipping out of the house without a word to her to row in a boat which was her namesake . But Corny was no rower and Mavis was . With Mavis rowing by her side , they cut silently through the jagged , multi-colored spears of light which were reflected onto the water from the pier where the dance band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other beat was just right . There were many boats out , but no one else , it was obvious , was out simply to row , to be abroad in the night , exposed to starshine and supported by water . Simply to row ? To look at the stars ? Oh no ! That was not true and Cress knew it . They were rowing toward someone , rowing toward a voice , a meeting on the water , toward the boy who would present the lovely shell and speak the secret words about the Sunday shine , the boy who would make the page turn and the meaning clear , as in the noblest book , here in the summer night , afloat on the dark reflecting water . As soon as she had admitted this , it was time to stop rowing ; she felt sleepy and tired . What did she expect ? Magic ? A barge appearing out of darkness like that which bore the dying King Arthur away ? An arm from the water clothed in white samite ? But with the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dance band had gone home ) playing a piano , sitting down in front of it and repeating a phrase as a radio player never did , and with the tide lifting the boats on the bay in a ceaseless sickle-shaped swing , leaving seemed ignoble . Or at least undaring . ( And were theyp230the same ? ) Was she giving up her search too easily ? Had this been a test and was the pattern of her life being decidedthis minute ? Oh come , knowledge and beauty . She asked it of the night and of the water , extending her arms upward and curling her toes earthward in her brown and white saddle shoes . " Come , knowledge and beauty , " she said aloud . Mavis perhaps did not understand her . Or perhaps did , and offered the best she had . Somewhere , from in or underher white drum-majorette kilt , she brought up a package of cigarettes , lit one for herself , then handed package and matches to Cress . It was not the first cigarette Cress had ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever taken . But she had never before taken more than one puff , and that only in front of a mirror , for the sake of what she saw there . Tonight smoking seemed , clearly , the thing to do . She walked homeward with Mavis , past the still lit bars and cafes and pool halls , trying to imitate Mavis ' nonchalance . It was beyond her , though ; she could manage neither the down-drooping cigarette , nor Mavis ' practiced majorette flip of her skirt . However short she came of Mavis , she did not come short enough to completely offset the effect of Mavis ' black bangs , brown legs and sashaying white pleats . Maribethhad been more than right . People noticed the twins , even when separated ; and her mother had been right , the name for people was boys . Boys looked and spoke as they went past and at the corner where they turned right , two boys who had been watching them as they came down thep231street turned right with them , and falling in behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two girls out pretty late ? " they asked . They were kids , Cress saw , sixteen or seventeen , and they did not attempt to catch up with them and she did n't feel anything but uncomfortable until , as they were leavingthe lights of the business district , three more boys joined the queue . Then she was frightened . Mavis was too ; she could tell by Mavis ' grip on her arm and the increasedspeed of her walking . And there were two more blocks before they would reach home , blocks shadowed by palm and jacaranda trees and misted with the morning fog already drifting in off the ocean . Mavis , without turning her head , whispered , " Let 's run . " " No , " Cress whispered back . What was the sense of that ? The boys could surely run faster than they could , and once running was started , all pretense that the boys just happened to be going their way would be lost . Though there was no denying that they were all walking faster and faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart , it was beating so hard , from the sound of the surf . And all the time the boys were calling to them , asking their names , where they went to school , what track team they were training for . " What 's your best time for the 440 , girls ? " they asked . " What 's that thing you 're wearing for a skirt ? " they called to Mavis . And , to Cress , " Hey , sweater girl , turn around . " It was worse than frightening , it was cheap , and Cress 's face burned.  | " What you looking for , girls , that we ai n't got ? " they called , and Cress thought how stupid she had been , lifting her arms over the water , asking for beauty and knowledge  --  when this was the answer , this cheapness and humiliation . The boys were gaining on them , coming closer and closer , and one of the boys used a word whose meaning she did n't know but whose sound was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Samms ' house , they were suddenly surrounded . The boys ' tone was still joking . One of them , an unlit cigarette in his mouth , said : " Give us a light , will you , girls ? " But in spite of the joke , the boys stood in that unyielding circle , close about Cress and Mavis . Cress , trembling , in a voice that scarcely emerged from her dry throat , said , and was hardly aware of what she said : " Is that all you want ? " These words , somehow , gave immediate pause to the joking . Miraculously the circle of boys opened , and the two girls walked through the gate and into the Samms ' yard . Once inside the yard , and the gate slammed behind them , they began to run . Neither spoke until they reached their own room and had that door closed behind them , too . Then Mavis , not in the least winded by the sprinting , said : " I do n't want to sleep in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And having said that , she calmly left . In a few minutes she returned with Avis . " I 'm going to sleep with my own twin , " she told Cress . " You go on down to Corny 's room . "  | " Mavis , " Cress asked , " what 's the matter ? " " You know , " Mavis said , as she and Avis moved with their duplicating steps across the floor . Cress , pajamas in hand , went down to Corny 's room . There Corny , her round face heavy with doubt , looked at her suspiciously . Cress apologized . " I 'm sorry to be disturbingyou , Corny . But the twins got homesick for each other . " " No , " Corny said . " It was n't homesickness for each other . It was disgust for you . " " Me ? " Cress asked . " What you said to those boys , " Corny explained . " What you asked them . " Cress moved up to the bed and in real amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corny cut her short . " And you 've been smoking , too . You really reek , Cress . I do n't blame Mavis for not wanting to sleep with you . I do n't want to either . I do n't think Mother would like me to , in fact . " " Mavis smoked too , " Cress said , feeling like a tattletale . " She does n't reek , " Corny persisted , turning away from her with finality . Rejection by Corny , who wanted everyone , even stray dogs , to love her , was the final humiliation . Cress , without a further word , went out to the living room . She could sleep on the sofa and in the morning she would hitchhikehome . But before she had undone a button Aunt Iris , still in her flowered dressing gown and with butterfly pinp234still aloft , though now somewhat askew , came to the doorway . " What is all this uproar about ? " she asked . " Corny does n't want to sleep with me , " Cress said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says I reek . " Aunt Iris was beside her now , sniffing . " Reek ? " she asked . " What of ? " " Tobacco , " Cress said . " Mavis and I went rowing and on the way home we smoked . " " I thought Mavis was the one you were sleeping with anyway , not Corny , " Aunt Iris said . " Mavis does n't want to sleep with me either , " Cress admitted . " Why ? " Aunt Iris asked . " She reeks too , does n't she ? " " Mavis does n't mind the tobacco . What she does n't likeis something I said . Anyway , that 's what she says . " " To her ? " " No . To some boys . " " What did you say ? " Aunt Iris asked . Cress told her . Aunt Iris said not a word but with face averted took the rhinestone butterfly from her braids and examined it closely . " One stone missing , " she said finally , replacing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room , " she told Cress , " and sleep with me . I reek too . " It was a fact . Aunt Iris ' room was hazed with smoke . " During the war , " Aunt Iris said , " when cigarettes were hard to get , I smoked a corncob pipe . I got to like it , butp235in a girls ' school I had to keep my door locked for fear of shocking someone . " Cress stared at Aunt Iris in astonishment . The idea of Aunt Iris shocking , instead of being shocked , was too great a reversal for her to comprehend so suddenly . Ignoring the image of Aunt Iris with a pipe , she said , " I 'm sorry I waked you , " which was the truth and was , besides , all she could think of to say at the minute . " I had n't gone to bed yet , " Aunt Iris told her . " I was working , then listening to music , then working again . " She waved her hand toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Cress thought of as " chemistry equipment "  --  objects , anyway , having to do with a laboratory  --  microscope , shallow dishes , an aquarium . But the room was filled with many things ; books , magazines , a portable phonograph  --  it looked like a place where a person was living , not empty and bare as the girls ' rooms were , places where they were only waiting . Aunt Iris opened a window , using a magazine to fan out some of the smoke . Then , leaning from the window , she said : " I should 've done this earlier . It 's a beautiful balmy night . Smell the iodine and salt and the bitter-sweet of the kelp . " She extended her arms into the night air and the big sleeves fell away from them and Cress saw that , while round and heavy , they were also firm and muscular ; saw that Aunt Iris with her broad shoulders and deep bosom , her full lips and straight but fleshy nose , was like a Romanmatron . " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clear , inscrutable , light years distant , reflected , since firstp236its burning reached us , in how many billion billion eyes , human and inhuman ? " Aunt Iris was moving her big strong arms in the air outside the windows now , rotating them as if she were bathing them in the night 's freshness . She turned from the window . " I tell you what we both need , Cress , since we both reek . A little dip . Ten minutes only . We 'll sleep better for it . " Cress said , " My suit 's down in the twins ' room . " " Suit ? " Aunt Iris asked . " What do you need a suit for at this hour of the night ? " Cress did n't know . So she said nothing . " Here , " Aunt Iris said , " you can wear this to the water . " It was a smock , Cress guessed , or a laboratory coat of the kind doctors wore . She undressed in silence , modestly turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a white toweling robe . The air outside was sweet and fresh , even a little sharp . Cress had to slow her steps for Aunt Iris , whose lameness gave her a clumsy laborious gait . " I never reconcile myself to this , " Aunt Iris said , slappingher crippled leg , " never , never . " Cress , trying to equal Aunt Iris ' matter-of-factness , asked , " Was it that way  --  from the beginning ? " " Do you mean was I born with it ? No . No . I got this in a most unlikely way , in a cyclone . When I was nineteen . At a dance in a schoolhouse in Kansas . I was the teacher , " she said , turning to speak over her shoulder and raising her voice to be heard above the surf . " In a way I was lucky that night , in a way I was n't . Five people were killed . Onep237of them was the boy I was going to marry that summer . That was my life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge now and Aunt Iris took off her white robe and threw it back up the beach and stood before Cress , a large indistinct column in the darkness of the night . " You could n't ever love anyone else ? " Cress asked , trying to take in the whole of Aunt Iris ' life from that longagonight in Kansas to this moment on the edge of the Pacific . " Oh yes , " Aunt Iris shouted , " I could indeed . But not any of those who were able themselves to love a lame woman . " She had stopped to say these words . Now she began to wade slowly out in the water . Cress threw off her own covering and walked into the water , milky warm after the night air . Ahead of her , ungainly , but steadfast in front of the deepening breakers , was Aunt Iris . " Would you like to go out with me tomorrow ? " she called back . " These rock pools here are regular mines for algae . " Hunting algae with Aunt Iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a house party . The last thing she had imagined a house party could be for . But as the warm water rose from knee to thigh to waist , and then went sliding shoreward past her , she did not seem to have lost , either the imagined house party , or the imagined boy with the shell and the words about the Sunday shine . She caught up handfuls of water and dashed them across her chest and face.  |p234Aunt  Iris was waiting for her and Cress called above the surf , " Oh yes , I do want to go . Please may I ? " Aunt Iris , without answering , faced the open sea again and motioning with one big arm for Cress to follow , dived under the wall of the comber toppling above her . Cress followed , diving less cleanly ; but she came up out of the smother in open water , only a little breathless , and swam easily in Aunt Iris ' wake.  |p239As  soon as Cress left the breakfast table to catch the school bus , Mrs. Delahanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to say a word to Cress about it until the night before , " she concluded . " If I do she 'll find reasons for backing out . She 's got a half-dozen acts she can do perfectly . Practice would just make her stiff and nervous . I 'll tell her the night before , at the earliest , that I 've given my word she 'll appear . She wo n't like it but in the long run it will be for her own good . " Mrs. Delahanty 's uncertainty about what she had done made her unusually positive in her manner . " Do n't you think so , John ? " she asked , when her husband said nothing . Mr. Delahanty poured the last of the waffle batter onto the iron and put down the lid . Then he took a leisurely drink of coffee . He was n't sure that he did think so . " I do n't know , Gertrude , " he said finally ; then , as he saw his wife believed he was simply being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " You think it 's our duty to encourage Cress to develop her talents , do n't you ? "  | " Some of them , I guess . " " Your waffle 's burning , John , " Mrs. Delahanty said , without much sorrow in her voice . Mr. Delahanty took it out , chocolate-colored and smoking . " Our trouble , Cress 's too probably , is that she 's an only child . " Mrs. Delahanty 's face , which had been so animated when she spoke of her plans for Cress , became sad . Mr. Delahanty reassured her . " I 'm just evading the issue , Gertrude . " " You do agree , do n't you , " she asked , " that this is an improvement over last winter ? " She indicated the improvementswith head and hand : the blinds rolled to the tops of the windows ; the tie-back curtains really tied back so that the glassed-in end of the kitchen where they were eating was filled with April sunshine . Almost filled , it seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close that a long arm could reach out from the breakfast table and pick fruit or blossoms . It was blossoms , now ; the Valencias would n't be ripe until July ; blossoms and mockingbirds and towhees . Every morning lately a towhee had tried to fly through the glass of the windows to sample the French toast and scrambled eggs . For there was , once again , French toast and scrambled eggs ; and waffles and cream gravy and strawberry preserves . The health foods had gone with the semi-darkness . Mr. Delahanty , setting his waffle afloat in syrup , said , " It 's a great improvement . No comparison between now and last winter . "  |p241Mrs  . Delahanty nodded . " I ca n't remember a more miserable winter . " " Tragedy , tragedy all the way , " Mr. Delahanty agreed . " And no real cause for tragedy . That 's what makes it so sad . No sickness . No death . " Without attempting to follow this line of reasoning , Mr. Delahanty said , " At fourteen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The darkness , or semi-darkness , for instance , in which they had lived out the winter : at first he had believed it to be accidental . He would come into the house , find the blinds all half down and go about systematically raising them . " Living like owls , " he would say to Cress , cheerfully , as if he himself were the one responsible for the gloom . " Getting to the place my eyes water every time I step outside , " he 'd say as he set the blinds to flying upward . If Cress had made any reply to these sallies , he could n't remember them . His remembrance was that she had said nothing . But when he re-entered a room there , once more , would be the pulled blinds , the cave-dweller gloom . Finally he had remarked on it . " What 's the big idea , Cress ? All this darkness ? " Cress had given him a long reproachful look . " Is it necessary , Father , to tell you in so many words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying it from the housetops ? " " I 'm still in the dark , Cress , " he had said , pleased at the time with the pun . Cress , at that , had raised every curtain and then in thep242clear light of the December afternoon had lifted her face for his inspection . " Need I say any more ? " " I guess you 'll have to , Cress , " he had told her , still uncertain as to what she was driving at . Then with a movement both tragic and courageous , like a martyr offering her neck to the ax , she had said , " Look at my complexion , Father . " He had looked , carefully . And seeing a little unevenness , a little redness possibly , had replied honestly , " Well , in this light , Cress . . . " But Cress had not let him finish . " Then it is visible . Oh I just hate this light . Why do peoplewant to live in a glare ? Where everything ugly is so plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , soft lights everywhere . " " Now , Cress , " he had begun , reasonably , " you know people are n't bats . And at your age a pimple or t  --  " Cress had not let him finish . She had put her hands over her face and made sounds , halfway between sorrow and nausea . When these had stopped she said in a whisper , " I would n't say such a disgusting word to an animal  --  let alone my own daughter . " Mr. Delahanty had tried to reassure her . " I would n't have said a word  --  not of any kind , except you insisted and only then . . . " Cress had taken down her hands . " It is perfectly visible then , " she asked , bleakly , " to the naked eye ? " " I do n't know that it 's perfectly visible , but in this light I can see , now that my attention is called to it "  --  he had searched for an acceptable word  --  " a bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . " Bump ? It 's more than a spot then ? " He had given up , at that , hunting the right word . " Cress , you 're being silly . There is n't a man or woman alive who has n't had complexion trouble at your age . " She had contradicted him fiercely . " Oh yes there are . Did you ever read Laddie ? " He thought he had . " A book about a collie ? By Albert Payson Terhune ? " " Oh no . This book is about a young man and it 's by Gene Stratton Porter . It 's a beautiful book and Laddie is my ideal . Laddie 's blood stream was so pure and his living so vivid that the bloom on his coffee and roses skin had never once been marred by the slightest flaw . That 's almost the exact words . I did n't try to memorize them but I never look at myself without thinking of them . His blood stream so pure , his living so vivid ! Is n't that beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out of complete inability to cope with this heartbreak and unreason Mr. Delahanty had pulled down with great finality the curtains Cress had raised for his examination of her complexion . " Cress , " he had said , " if it makes you feel better to have things a little gloomy I do n't see why not . We 've had blazing sunlight in this house for fifteen years . If you want a little darkness now it 's your turn to call the trick . " So , in semi-darkness and eating sparsely , they had lived through the winter . The sparse diet was not the result of Cress 's desire for a flawless complexion  --  but for vividp244living , a revolt against the grossness of the world . Anna Pavlova , Cress said , weighed ninety-two pounds . Thomas A. Edison ate four water biscuits for lunch . So what were they , the Delahantys , doing eating great pots of Spanish rice and platters of Swiss steak and pans of Lazy-Daisy coffee cake ? And weighing one hundred and eighty-two , one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were not geniuses or dancers or inventors or artists ? The least they could do was to eat like a genius , was n't it ? Was n't it ? There was no loving answer to this insane logic so they , without hope of anything but losing a pound or two , lived plain , at least at the table ( away from the table Mr. Delahanty had an unplain bite or two ) and tried to think high . Hominy grits with canned apricots for dessert . It was pallid fare in the midst of the semi-darkness . Mr. Delahanty had begun to feel  --  if not like Edison  --  atleast like Byrd at the South Pole . But he had not Byrd 's sustaining knowledge of emerging eventually into sunlight , full rations , and with the plaudits of an admiring and sympathetic public for his ordeal . And though he did it all , if not gladly , at least resignedly , for Cress 's sake , Cress seemed none the happier for it . Her complexion continued to be flawed and her living un-vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl there in a sweater , a miserableconspicuous person . She made a speech in assembly welcoming a delegation from a neighboring high school and pronounced the word hospitable with the accent on the second syllable . She had volunteered a piece of mis/taken information in her English class , insisting that a poem by T. S. Eliot had been written by Edwin Arlington Robinson . She was not elected , as she had expected to be , editor of her year book . She read Mrs. Gaskell 's Life of Charlotte Bronte and wondered if , after what the Brontes had suffered , anyone had a right to be happy . Then , in the midst of all these misfortunes , the Californiawinter rains still falling , grossness still abroad in the world , her complexion flawed and her weight stationary at one hundred and fourteen , she had come home from school one afternoon to send every blind flying to the top of the window and to ask for French-fried shrimps and chocolate pudding for dinner . And she had eaten them with no thought , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Edison , or Laddie . And after dinner she had been funny , consciously , clownishly , ridiculouslyfunny . As an entertainer is . They had laughed , they could n't help themselves . But they had been troubled . Back of the funniness there had been tensity , a suggestion of the clown 's conscious assumption of a mask , beneath which a life unguessed , and possibly quite contradictoryto the side-splitting facade , existed . " Why this sudden change , Cress ? " her father had asked . " Change ? " Cress echoed , as if feasting , bright lights , and jollity had been their winter 's routine . " All this jollity ? All these non-water biscuits ? " " Life , " Cress had answered , quoting again but not from Gene Stratton Porter , " is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those who think . "  |p246And  there , for all the further information given them , the matter rested . And if thinking meant comedy , then Cress had become a thinker , for there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the spring sunlight putting a green-gold dazzle across the white tablecloth , were merry . The fun had not only continuedthrough March and into April but it had developed as it continued . It was a little like living with a cross betweenMartha Graham and Groucho Marx : dancing with a wisecrack . " The trouble is , " Mrs. Delahanty confessed to her husbandas she took the last bite of his syrup-logged waffle , " that I do n't know what to call it . " " Call what ? " " Cress 's act . " " Act " was a more formal word than Mr. Delahanty had himself ever applied to what Cress did . " Take-offs " had been his own name for these  --  whatever they were  --  imitationsor dances or pantomimes or caricatures . But " takeoff , " he supposed , was too general a phrase for the talent committee . And though he did not wholly approve of what his wife was doing , still his mind engaged itself automaticallywith the verbal problem she had posed . " What would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " for a title ? " She thought it would be fine ; serious , unusual , and professional . Mr. Delahanty , since his wife spoke of the matter no more , let it drop from his own mind . Spring vacation camep247and Cress 's acts , while they continued , no longer struck him as a problem . On Tuesday evening of vacation week Cress entertained them after dinner with one of her best take-offs to date : the girl at a dance , who is a wall-flower and tries to hide the fact that she is dying with a broken heart by an excess of responsive smiles and clapping . It was very funny ; also very sad , as the best comedy is . Mr. Delahanty laughed until he cried . At least there were tears on his cheeks when Cress finished and wandered off into the living room leaving her father and mother to savor second pieces of the still unaccustomed pleasures of pecan pie and whipped cream . Mr. Delahanty 's savoringwas arrested in mid-bite by Cress 's return to the dining room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she demanded . " What is what , Cress ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked , with a quaver of guilt in her voice which Mr. Delahanty with some pity recognized . " List of Entrants for Talent Parade , " Cress read . " The following individuals will participate in the Chamberof Commerce 's Fifth Annual Talent Parade on Wednesday , April 7th . The Talent Parade has come to be anticipated , not only by the citizens of Tenant , but by residentsof our sister cities . The Chamber of Commerce points with pride to the fact that their annual talent search has resulted in the discovery of such figures in the local entertainment fields as Deborah Dukes , xylophonist at the China Barn , and Billy Ryan , well-known tap dancer at many lodge meetings and community affairs . Wednesday'sp248list of entrants includes the following performers , some already favorably known to followers of the arts in Tenant . I. Trained Duck  --  Judith Connors. 2 . Unicycle Act  --  Barry Zamalt. 3 . The Topsborough Twins in Two-Ettes. 4 . Moaning Low  --  Louella Enfield . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whistling Sam  --  Sam Harrison . 7 . Caricatures in Motion  --  Crescent Delahanty . " Letting the paper drop Cress asked , very distantly and coldly , " What are Caricatures in Motion ' ? " She said the three words , " Caricatures in Motion " as if they were some unknown but nasty-sounding dish on a menu . Mr. Delahantyleft this question to his wife . She said , " Caricatures in Motion ' was your father 's idea for a title , Cress . " " Title for what ? " Cress asked . " What you just did . That girl at the dance . " " Oh , " Cress said . " Why is my name on that list ? " " Because , " Mrs. Delahanty told her , " I entered it . Becauseyou have talent and I wanted other people to be able to enjoy what you can do . And you might win a prize . " " I do n't want to win a prize . I hate prizes . " Mr. Delahanty , in spite of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade found himself , to his surprise , defending his wife . " Cress , without a push from us you would never have entered this , would you ? You 'd have found excuses . " " Yes , " Cress said . " I would have . " " Oh , Cress , " Mrs. Delahanty said , " if you really hate it , you do n't have to do it . That list is n't legal or binding . Just refuse , just do n't go . " - 4 " No , " Cress said , " if you have given your word I 'll do it . " She stooped and picked up the newspaper , folded it carefully , then went to her room . Mrs. Delahanty pushed her pecan pie aside . " Oh John , " she said , " why did you let me ? " Mr. Delahanty finished his pie , but the responsibility thus handed him weighed heavily . The days of gloom and water biscuits seemed uncomplicated by contrast . Two days later at ten o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenant , stood on Jacaranda Street waiting for the Talent Parade to pass by . " Can you see Cress ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . " She ought to be easy to see in that outfit she 's got on . " " Not yet , " Mr. Delahanty answered . " Try to pick her out . I do n't want to miss her . I want to wave . I want to  --  " She did n't finish her sentence but she did n't have to . Mr. Delahanty knew what she meant . She wanted to ask forgiveness , to make amends , to say , It was pride in you made me do it , Cress . It was love . Mr. Delahantyknew this because it was what he wanted to say , too . The Chamber of Commerce had chosen Wednesday of Easter Week for the affair so that school children could participate . This choice had showed considerable confidence in the weather , even for a Chamber of Commerce , for early April can be cold and rainy in Southern California . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which even the announcer 's superlatives were not exces/sive . " Brilliant sunshine , " he was saying , " dazzling skies , " " exotic blossoms , " and it was all literally true . There was not a cloud , a breath of chill , or a single hibiscus or Paul scarlet with any apparent touch of blight or bite of earwig . Bands went by , drum majorettes spun and rotated like tops , batons flashed , loudspeakers mounted on floats proclaimedthe virtues of a variety of products . " I did n't know it would be like this , " Mrs. Delahanty shouted . She had to shout to be heard above the V.F.W. band which was passing in front of them at that minute . " What did you expect ? " Mr. Delahanty shouted back . " Dignity . Some dignity , anyway . Not so many automobilesadvertising things . Not so many animals . " A boy of twelve or thirteen with a dog of about the same age went by . The dog was mustard-colored and trotted sidewise like a coyote . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncombed strands that he appeared to be wearing a cap of basket-weave straw . Behind the boy an old man , a juggler , of all things , kept three red balls continuously mounting , flowing upward from his yellow hands like spray from an ancient fountain . " Jugglers , " Mrs. Delahanty shouted . " Ducks , dogs . Cress will be humiliated . " " It 's no parade of simon-pure artists , that 's a fact , " Mr. Delahanty agreed . It was also a fact that talent parade was beginning to look to him like some representative selection of midtwentiethcentury humans , animals and artifacts being marched off to a time capsule for preservation for poster/Iity . He began to feel like the father of a sacrificial victim , as if Cress were some Aztec maiden about to have her heart torn from her living body for the good of her tribe . And what were Cress 's " take-offs " anyway but exposures of her heart ? And why had he been so willing  --  or at least willing  --  for that exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady , your daughter ? " Cress 's well-being ? That one talent which is death to hide ? Was being funny Cress 's one talent ? And why , at her age , had she developed a talent like that , anyway ? The last resort of unhappy middle-aged men  --  a settling for the second best after the best is lost . A girl 's dream was n't ever of making Prince Charming laugh , was it ? Cinderella did n't oblige at the ball with a caricature in motion , did she ? Not after she saw that the crystal slipper was for her , anyway . But if you had no confidence ? Well , you did something , you did n't give up . Not right away at least . Not if the old juggler was any sign . Sorrow at home and the curtains pulled was perhaps a better answer for a girl than this public merriment . Mrs. Delahanty joggled him out of his abstractions . " There she is , John . Wave . " She was almost abreast of them before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smock or a shirt ; a clear yellow with a brown sash which held the fullness of the material close to her tall , big-boned body . He waved eagerly but there was no response . Had n't she seen him ? Or was she already lost in anticipation of her takeoff ? Mrs. Delahanty waved and called , but Cress marchedp252straight on , a kind of self-conscious young Lady Godiva in spite of her being thoroughly clothed . Behind her the line of the talented was as long as that in front of her . Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty marveled at its length . They had had no idea of the amount of talent in Tenant . As noon approached the sun became warmer and the last marchers were pink-faced and warm , many of them carryingtheir coats . The announcer began to suggest that the onlookers make their way to the bandstand in McHenry Park where the performances were to take place . Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty needed no urging . They wanted to be there early in case Cress was among the first on the program : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see well . They were charitable about the acts they saw while waiting for Cress , though after a while Mrs. Delahanty said , " I do n't know why I did n't enter . " They had to admit , however , that the boy with the basket-weave hair had a talented dog . The boy rolled through a series of hoops and the dog , as the boy did this , leaped over him , a kind of canine shadow projected upward instead of downward . Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty applauded this spontaneouslyand a man next to them in a flowered seersucker shirt said , " That 's my boy . " As the clapping continued , he stopped . " No use overdoing it , " he told the Delahantys . " There 's plenty of others waiting for their chance . You represented here ? " he asked , tapping his program as the applause died down.  |p253Mr  . Delahanty indicated Cress 's name on the program . " Our daughter , " he said . " Glad to make your acquaintance , Mr. Delahanty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? Sounds interesting . Just what are they ? " Mr. Delahanty went back to the phrase which he had supposed the Chamber of Commerce would not consider snappy enough , but which he now wished they had used , " take-offs . " " They 're take-offs , I guess . " " Take-offs ? On what ? " " Well , various things . She 's got a number of them . Ladies at bargain counters . People making speeches . Things like that . " " Funny , are they ? " Andrews asked . " We think so , " Mr. Delahanty said . " Real funny . " But when Cress came out in her odd bag of a costume , so tacky after the sopranos in their beads and scarves and the tap dancers in their satin shorts , she was not funny at all . She was pitiful . " What is this a take-off on ? " Mr. Andrews asked in a polite but puzzled tone after watching for a minute or two . " I 'm as much at sea as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw this before . " And he was still at sea minutes later . " Peculiar thing , " Mr. Andrews remarked . " Maybe too deep for me . I can see the motion but I miss the caricature . I do n't get what it 's about . " Neither did Mr. Delahanty . But he kept his mouthp254closed . If he did n't he felt he might cry . Whatever Cress 's bounding about up there was supposed to convey , it was n't funny . It was n't entertaining in any other way either . It was embarrassing , like watching the fumblings of a lame man or a blind woman . Oh God , Mr. Delahanty asked , let her get down from there before they start laughing at her . They did n't do that . There was somethingtoo confiding and open about this big serious girl , trying so hard to say something , do something  --  they did n't know what , and failing . But they could not watch her , it was too painful ; they turned aside , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . Finally they simply talked , relieved to pretend that what was happeningup there on the bandstand was invisible . Except for Mr. Andrews , the Andrews boy who had joined his father , and Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty , Cress might as well have been alone . Mr. Andrews studied the performance seriously as if by concentration he could unravel some meaning . But even he gave up . " Your girl would be wise to call a halt about now . " Wise or not , Cress called a halt and the onlookers , happy to be spared further pain , clapped enthusiastically . Cress had , before the clapping began , given the crowd a happy , confiding look , a refreshed look as if , though she had traveled alone , she had arrived some place . She was red-faced from all her leaping and prancing and her short tow-colored hair stood up in points like the nimbus around a child 's drawing of the sun . Now , in response top255the applause , she made a happy , confiding bow , still child enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and appreciation . Cress was at the car talking with Edwin when they got to the parking lot . Seeing them , they slowed their steps . Whatever Cress believed  --  either the truth that she had failed , or the untruth , which the applause might have conveyed to her , that she had succeeded  --  they did n't know how to greet her . Out of sorrows and disappointments , out of a flawed complexion and the death of animalsand the cruelty of husbands and wives , you build yourself an edifice of escape , a funny act in which you can live for a while until your confidence returns , pretending to the outside world that everything 's a big joke anyway . And then if that edifice collapses ? What next ? What 's left ? Do you give up ? They did n't know the answers  --  or at least any answers they thought would be as helpful as Edwin 's  --  and they delayed their arrival as long as possible . " John , " whispered Mrs. Delahanty , clasping his arm , " why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trag-edy ? " If it was a tragedy , Cress did n't look it . Edwin was gone and she was in the back seat when they arrived , her horrible " Caricature in Motion " costume replaced by her usual sweater and skirt , and she was crunching Cracker Jack . Mr. Delahanty opened the back door and gazed at her.  | " Hi , " Cress greeted him . When he made no reply Cress said , " Well , Mother always knows best . " There was no sarcasm in her voice but Mrs. Delahanty asked , " What do you mean , Cress ? " " Making me do this act . I feel a lot better . " " Did you like the way  --  it went over ? " Mr. Delahanty faltered , fearful of either answer . Cress laughed . " It did n't go over . It was the lousiest act on the program . And that 's saying something . " Mr. Delahanty looked for signs of dried tears , for the false heartiness of bravado . Finding neither , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts . " " It was a flop , " Cress said . " People suffered . " " You did n't seem to suffer , Cress . " " I was too busy . I was figuring . " " How to improve it ? " " That thing ? I was working on what it was about . " " What was it about ? " Mr. Delahanty asked . " I still do n't know . " " Its title , " Cress said , " was Winter . ' It was n't supposed to be funny . " " It was n't , " Mr. Delahanty agreed . Mr. Delahanty knew that pretty soon he would ask Cress what " Winter " was about . But not right now . Now was a little interim of peace . Now he wanted to drive away from the pain of the past two hours before he invited further revelations . He slid in under the wheel , eased the car out of the parking lot , and headed toward home . In the back seat Cress was humming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Tenant . " Whatever " Winter " had been about , it had evidently been a catharsis of some kind . Though Cress had been a comedian for a month or two , she had never sung . " Gertrude , " he said , " enter me in the next Talent Contestthat comes along , will you ? " " Why John , what can you do ? " Mrs. Delahanty asked . Finally he said , " I might do a little number called Spring . "  |p261The  interior conversations of Crescent Delahanty started , consciously , the spring she was fifteen . In an April twilight , the delicacy of early evening and early spring mingling , she admitted for the first time that it was impossible to tell other people what they were determined not to believe . But she did n't  --  could n't  --  stop for a minutecontradicting their false statements ; all she could do was stop doing this out loud . The counter-statements , the explanations , the corrections , continued to be made , though no longer audibly . She was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flurries of feeling crossed her face ; but she remained mute . That spring she abandoned forever the belief which , in spite of setbacks , had persisted through childhood , that to be understoodone has only to tell the truth . There were some truths which some people  --  particularly parents  --  simply could not swallow . Particularly about their own children . They just could n't and it was useless to try to make them . She was at the dining-room table memorizing geometry theorems and their proof . The windows were open and the scent of daphne mingled with the smell of a meatp262loaf baking for dinner . It was about time to turn on the lights but she kept postponing it , knowing that if she stopped studying for even a minute or two , she would probably stop for good . Her mother and her mother 's friend , Mrs. Agnew , were visiting in the living room . They kept their voices low , but since the two rooms were separated only by an archway , she could n't help hearing them . When one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometry and really listened . " Boys ! " Mrs. Agnew said , using once more the word that had caught her attention . " If any other idea ever enters Joan 's head , I do n't know it . " Joan was Mrs. Agnew 's daughter and Cress 's friend . She continued , " I do n't know what 's happened to girls nowadays . When I was fifteen , I did n't know boys existed . " Cress awaited her mother 's reply with interest , but Mrs. Delahanty had nothing to say of her own youth . Instead , she said pensively , " I do n't suppose we really appreciate how lucky we are with Cress . She 's never given us a minute'sworry . In that regard , I mean . " " Cress is just like I was , " Mrs. Agnew agreed . " Boys do n't exist for her . " " I expect that 's perhaps carrying it a little too far , " Mrs. Delahanty admitted . " But she does have so many other interests . She debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad about track meets . " Mrs. Agnew sighed so strongly the sound carried clear to the dining room . " Well , do n't rub it in , Gertrude . Cress is a girl in a thousand . You can tell that just by lookingp263at her . She 'll marry late , if at all . Be a career woman of some sort . I can see her all in white , a lady M.D. Devotedto healing . Ca n't you ? There 's something so wholesomeand out-of-doorsy about Cress . The way she loves plaid , for instance . " Mrs. Delahanty said , " I wo n't prophesy about the future , Kay , but I do admit it 's a pleasure to have the boy business postponed for a while . " Cress closed her geometry book , and began , quite consciously , her interior conversation , a reply it was useless for her to make aloud . Why ? Because they really had been different when they were fifteen ? Because they had some picture of an ideal fifteen-year-old which they wanted her to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else did they get this picture of her , the calm outdoor girl in a plaid skirt , the debater and basketball player , the yell leader ; the junior M.D.Oh Mother , oh Mrs. Agnew ! Is that what you see ? The girl who never thinks about boys ? Why I do n't ever think about anything else , really . And then , because she was trying to tell the truth , she explained that " really . " By " really " I do n't mean all the time , but " completely . " I think about geometry , of course , but not with all my mind the way I think about boys . The first lie I ever told  --  that I can remember  --  was because of a boy . But I remember that lie exactly , and how I hated it and repented it . But I had to do it because of Tommy Fitzgerald . I was five . He was six or seven.  |p264We  had both been brought to a party and we stood by the bed where our mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my mother 's hat . It cost $2.98 . " He was proud of it , he thought it was beautiful , and even I , at five , knew that a $2.98 hat was cheap and that whatever it had cost , Mrs. Fitzgerald 's hat was not pretty . It was made of varnished straw and the flowers were of materials not pleasant to see or touch , faded and flimsy already , though it was new . It even smelled cheap . " Which is your mother 's hat ? " Tommy asked . I showed him . It was lavender , trimmed with lilacs deeper in color and more velvety than real lilacs , and it had a silky veil caught up with a pin with a real moonstonein it . " How much did it cost ? " Tommy asked . It had cost ten dollars , but I heard the ashamed note in Tommy 's voice . Had he praised something silly ? " Just the same , " I said . That , somehow , seemed less of a lie than to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snap with thumb and forefinger to the flowers of both hats  --  to show how unimportanthats  --  and mothers  --  and money were . " $2.98 ? I guess that 's the regular price ? " he said . I nodded another lie . Why ? Because I loved Tommy . When we moved to Tenant he gave me a ring with a blue forget-me-not for a setting . I still have it . I still rememberTommy . I still remember that lie . When we moved to Tenant , I was nine years old and in the fifth grade . Do you remember Hubert Fairchild ,  |p265Mother  ? The kids called him Bert , but I never did . He 's dead now . He died during the war , but when I was nine he was fourteen and in the eighth grade , and planning to be a minister . Maybe he was an awful sissy  --  I do n't know . He came to school late , because he 'd had typhoid that summer  --  and his head was shaved because during the fever most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and spiritual and I loved him . I loved him so much that I hid my face in my desk and cried and cried . Do you know why , Mother ? Because he had been sick and in pain and I had n't been there to nurse him . All that summer while I 'd been carefree , going to the beach and the mountains , he 'd been suffering . It broke my heart . Really I thought it did . So I cried and cried . I told you about it . You thought I should be a Red Cross nurse because I was so tender-hearted . I told you as clearly as I could , but you would n't believe a word I said . I cried and moped and you thought it was sickness and suffering that made me unhappy . It was n't . It was Hubert . And now ? Debating ? Because Calvin Dean was on the team last year . In assembly , do you know why I sit with my arm around the back of the seat of the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row behind us . To suggest things to them . Yes , I do . Do n't argue , do n't contradict . I know . I 'm the one who does it . And sometimes when I ride into town with Father at dusk , do you know what I do ? I sit close to him so people will perhaps think he 's a date . Once , a kid did . He asked me about him the nextp266day . " Who was the guy I saw you out with last night ? " he asked . And track meets ? Oh Mother ! " Mad about track meets . " What do I care now about track meets ? All that running and jumping and sawdust pits and high and low hurdles ? Nothing , except that he is always there . But if I tell you and Mrs. Agnew , you wo n't believe it ; you 'll say I do n't know my own mind , or what I 'm talking about . You 'll say , if you do believe it , it 's puppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't talk about it . But how else can a puppy love  --  except like a puppy ? He ca n't be grown up . Or a tiger or a python . I 'm fifteen . I 'm in love . I wo n't tell you a word about it . But do n't be dumb , Mrs. Agnew , just because I wear a plaid skirt and am a yell leader . The way I act and the way I feel are two different things . And do n't think , Mother , just because he 's sick too that I ought to be a Gray Lady or something . I had heard about him before , but when I saw him I did n't know who he was . He was always at the track meets , dark and slender and burning-faced . He stood very straight when he walked , but he always walked toward something , something to lean against or sit on  --  the grandstand , a marker-cart , a box of Coca-Cola . He watched everything very intently , not just the boys running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walnut grove next to the track ; or a meadow lark on a post . He drank things in , he tipped the cup of seeingp267until he had the last drop . He had to  --  because he 's dying . He is Mr. Cornelius . Now you know who he is . He is the father of the Cornelius boys , the track stars . The boys ' names are Norman , Wayne , and Lester . They are thirteen , fifteen , and seventeen years old . Mr. Cornelius is thirty-eight . Yes , he is one year older than Father . His name is Mark . His wife drives one of the school buses . She is heavy , with short curly hair that sticks out from under a cap like a taxi man wears . She looks like a lady general in the Russian army . Mr. Cornelius lives in a little tent-house outside his own house so that he can have more fresh air . It is in the walnut orchard , halfway between his house and the school grounds . We can hear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music I have never heard before . When I go to the track meets I watch him all the time and by now he knows that I do . He smiles at me , he nods his head , he clapped once , just for me to see , when I did a particularly good back-flip , leading yells . It was silent  --  but I saw . We never spoke but once . He said , " Do you know my boys ? " I said " Yes . " He said , " Do you like track meets ? " I told him the exact truth . " Yes , but not for the same reason I used to . " He knew then ; I know he knew . His eyes , they 're hazel , deepened and darkened . He said , " What 's your name ? " I told him . " Crescent Delahanty . " He said , " I know your father , Crescent . I like him . " That is all we ever said to each other . But he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know whether he loves me or not but I know I am special for him . There is a special look he has for me , of tenderness , of lovingness . And not as if I were his daughter , either . It is a different look ; he would put his arms around me and kiss me , I know , if I went to him , if I put my cheek to his and said " I love you . " I do n't know why he would , exactly . It 's not that I have any illusions about being beautiful or talented or glamorous . Is it that I understand more than anyone else how it is for him to be dying ? Is it worse for him because he sees more than anyone else ? Because he has more to leave behind , a thousand times as much perhaps as ordinarypeople ? And because he was an athlete too ? I 've heard about it at school , how many records he broke as a boy  --  so he has to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had those , people who can only half see or half touch or who can only jogtrot , not run , and who never hear meadow larks or music , dying ca n't be so hard for them . Can it ? And I know how hard it is for him to leave these things , because I practice all the time being him . I begin when I wake up in the morning by thinking , This may be my last day on earth , because whatever he suffers I want to suffer . I would do anything to save him or to make him happy . The minute she told herself this , Cress asked herself , " Do you mean it ? Would you die for him ? Do you love him enough to die for him ? " You must stop saying it ifp269it is n't true . You must stop saying you love him , even , if you are n't willing to die for him , because otherwise it 's just an infatuation or something . True love would give up its life a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture . Nothing would matter . Think of soldiers in wartime who die for friends and how much more you feel for Mr. Cornelius than a soldier can feel for any friend . For a long time she had known there was a thing she must do for Mr. Cornelius , a sacrifice she must offer ; though for him , it would not be a sacrifice  --  should her offer be accepted  --  but the greatest joy . To give him life ! She stood up , and her mother called to her : " Cress , if you 've finished studying , take your things to your room , will you ? It 's about time to set the table and Mrs. Agnew 's going to stay for dinner . " Cress gathered up her books and papers and stopped in the dining room to greet Mrs. Agnew . She tried to fathom how Mrs. Agnew might have looked as a girl . It was strange how women lost , as they grew up , their own private , special look . She could tell at once what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull  --  by her looks . Girls flashed signals as to who they were , jumped , screamed , cried : they let you know . But grown-up women like Mrs. Agnew ? What could you tell about her ? Except that she was grown-up . She was round , she was gray , she was grown-up . She had crawled in under a smooth shell . She had heard her mother ask her father about women who looked like Mrs. Agnew , " What does her husbandp270do ? " Trying to get hold of some label which would make her different from other women just like her . Mrs. Agnew 's husband was a dentist . That was the most personalthing about Mrs. Agnew . How different Mr. Cornelius was , how much himself ; how many thousand times more he was , in himself , than anything he had done . He had been an athlete , then a telephonelinesman , and now he was sick and dying . But he was so much more than these things ; he was like a phoenix which rose above all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as present as Mrs. Agnew could never be . She had to look through Mr. Cornelius , he was so much closer and more real than Mrs. Agnew to see Mrs. Agnew at all . Mr. Cornelius who wasMrs . Agnew spoke , spoiling this reverie . " Now do n't let us two old chatterboxes keep you from your studying , Cress . I was just telling your mother how much I admire it in you . In fact I said you were my ideal schoolgirl . " " Thank you , Mrs. Agnew , " Cress said . She went directly to the bathroom because that was the one room in the house where she could  --  at this time of the day , anyway  --  lock the door , be alone without question or interruption . She put her books on the toilet seat ; then , feeling that what she was about to do needed ritualistic preparation , she thoroughly washed her hands and face , and combed her hair . It never occurred to her that the bathroom , with its rack of toothbrushes , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what she intended to do . It had 1been the scene , since she was a little girl , of her most intense and private feelings . She had cried more tears here than in any other room in the house . It was a room whose looks she liked  --  small , glistening , quiet . From the bathtubyou could look out into the tops of a clump of eucalyptustrees where the buzzards roosted and could see , while your body rested fish-like in the water , the buzzards floating noiselessly in the evening air . They were not noiselesswhen they landed on the trees  --  then their wings creaked like barn doors closing on rusty hinges . Once , after a strong Santa Ana had blown the bathroom window open , she found a feather in the bathtub  --  as if an angel had been bathing . When she finished combing , she put cologne on her hands and face ; then she looked at herself in the mirror ; not so much to see her face , note its size and shape , estimate its prettiness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This might be , if she was serious enough ( and she saw nothing but seriousness in her eyes ) , and if God were willing , her last sight of her face . In the mirror she could see at the base of her throat the quick pulse of her heart . It jarred her with the heaviness of its thud . Her tongue felt swollen and her mouth dry . She took from the wash-basin faucet what might be her last taste of water . She let the water trickle slowly down her throat . Then she went to the window for a final look at the world . It was that time of evening , the last minutes before completedark , when buzzards take a bedtime flight . At this hour there seems to be an updraft from the earth so thatp272without any movement of their wings they hang effortlesslyin mid-air ; or soar , wings still unmoving , upward and upward , riding on earth 's breath , no longer birds but dots on a diagram illustrating motion . The sun was already down and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mud-choked , covered the western sky . The eucalyptus trees , silhouetted against this , were filled with the interlacingmovement of their long brittle leaves . It was like scissors blades crisscrossing or the soundless flutter of pendants from a Chinese wind harp ; though when a big wind blew , the eucalyptus trees could boom like surf in a storm . She gazed a long time . At last she understood that she was no longer saying farewell , only postponing . So she said , " Farewell , " out loud , went to the bathtub and knelt with her head pressed against its rim . She had n't planned this position , but it did seem right for what she intended to do , since people both prayed and were beheaded on their knees . She knelt there and imagined death : its nothingness , its everlastingness . She thought of the way it might feel arriving , the terror as it approached , the possible anguish as of bones crushed or flesh burned  --  only of course a million million times worse . She tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying farewell to  --  her own face in the mirror , her father and mother and outside the window , the enormous world of which the visible yellow sky , the dark birds and clashing leaves were the smallest , smallest part . But then she thought of Mr. Cornelius , how the day wasp273probably ending for him : lying on his cot bed in his little tent-house , burning with fever , waiting for his supper tray  --  and waiting too for death . With this thought and at the sight of Mr. Cornelius , for she did see him behind her closed eyes , her love became exactly strong enough for what she intended to do  --  to offer her life for his . Not to kill herself  --  what good would that do  --  but say to God , " If it is Your holy will , please let me die and Mr. Corneliuslive . " " Please let Mr. Cornelius live " did not seem to her a prayer of much strength . Who would n't pray that  --  for any sick person in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick person in the United States get well ; but she doubted that God paid much attention to such prayers . " What are you willing to do ? " she imagined God asking the person who made such a prayer  --  and she did n't blame Him . For Mr. Cornelius , she was willing to do all that she could do , she was willing to die . That was a prayer she thought God might hear , a prayer she could n't have made , really , otherwise . Now that she was about to say the words , her throat became almost too dry to pronounce them . The blood in her forehead beat against the rim of the tub . " Dear God , " she said , " I am willing to die to save Mr. Cornelius ' life . " She had no intention of pleading with God for Mr. Cornelius . He surely knew His own mind . But " willing " was perhaps too weak a word . She repeated her prayer , or pact  --  whatever it was  --  another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me die instead of Mr. Cor-nelius . " She waited then . Scarcely breathing , terribly alive , ready for death . For a second she thought it was coming , that God was going to grant her prayer . Feeling was draining away , light failing , a great wave-like sound increasing ; perhaps it was the sound of death arriving . Then the sound diminished , light and feeling returned . She had not died and was not going , just then anyway , to die . However , she had placed no time limit on her offer . She had n't said , " Now or never , " to God . The pact was forever as far as she was concerned . He could change His mind any time He wanted to and take her life instead of Mr. Cornelius ' . As she continued to kneel she heard her mother at the bathroom door . " Cress , Cress , " she called , " we 're waiting dinner for you . " She rose unsteadily and went to the window . It had grown darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went again to the mirror , expecting to find in her face , anyway , some change , some evidence of renunciation or of dedication . Except for the red band across her forehead , where it had rested against the tub , her face too was unchanged . She washed in cold water and had another drink , because she still felt unsteady and a little sick at her stomach . Then she went out to the supper table . The three of them , her father , mother , and Mrs. Agnew were already seated . Mrs. Agnew said , " Studying , home on time for meals , no make-up ! Joanie is just going top275hate you , Cress , if I keep holding you up to her as an example , the way I do . " " Thank you , Mrs. Agnew , " Cress said . She helped herself to the fish which might contain the bone which would be the means of her keeping her pact and said mutely , I love you , Mr. Cornelius , and think of you every minute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last word though . Pausing in the task of pulling the backbone from her fish , and shaking her head in commiseration for her own lost youth she said , " Never forget , Cress , that life will not always be so easy . "  |p276Mr.  and Mrs. Delahanty , Cress , and Cress 's friends , Jo Grogan and Bernadine Deevers , sat down to the Delahantydinner table on Wednesday evening . The table was round with a white cloth that dipped at its four corners to the floor , so that in the dusk of the dining room the cloth seemed actually to be supporting the table . Mrs. Delahanty , who had n't even expected Cress home for dinner , let alone Jo and Bernadine , felt apologetic about the food which , besides being rather uninviting , was skimpy in amount : a small salmon loaf , Harvard beets , mashed potatoes , and for dessert a cabinet pudding which did nothing to redeem the meal that had gone before . But the girls did n't seem to know or care what they put in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been wasted on them . A mockingbird was singing in the orange grove outside the opened windows and the girls listened , a spoonful of cabinet pudding lifted to their opened lips  --  then , as the song ceased , put the spoons down without having tasted a bite . Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty had given up trying to carry on a conversation with them and treated them as sop277many portraits ranged round their dining room  --  " Girls at Dusk , " or " Reveries of Youth . " They talked their own talk and let the girls dream their dreams , wrap their feet around the rungs of their chairs , and listen ( mouths open , eyes closed ) to the bird song . " I saw Doc Mendenhall in town today , " Mr. Delahanty said . Mrs. Delahanty said " Yes ? " waiting for whatever it was that made this fact worth reporting , but Bernadine interrupted his train of thought , if he had one , by extendingher long arms toward the darkening windows and singingvery softly , " Oh night of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the spring 's great fad at high school ) though she was eighteen , and wore an elaborateblue voile dress which drifted about her like a skystainedcloud . Bernadine was to be married the day after school was out and sometimes , Mrs. Delahanty felt , overplayedher role of bride-to-be . It was already , unbelievably , the last week of school which , in Southern California , is the second week in June , a time climatically as well as scholastically neither one thing nor another , neither spring nor summer , neither truly school nor truly vacation . Class routines had been relaxed but not abandoned . Grade-wise , the feeling among the students was that the year was already water over the dam ; still they could n't be positive ; some of the teachers were still going through the motions of setting down grades in their record books . Climatically the days started spring-like , damp and gray with threat even of one morep278unseasonal rain ; at t P.M. exactly the day did an aboutface , took on September inclinations . At that hour the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smoldering flowers of full summer emerged . It was very confusing after getting up into a dripping cold which made sweaters and open fires necessary , to finish the day barefooted , hot-cheeked , and as naked as possible . Cress and Jo both wore shorts and halters . Cress had shasta daisies tucked in the V of her halter and Jo Grogan , with those three flame-colored hibiscus in her short dark hair , might have been August itself on any calendar of girls . As the day darkened the white tablecloth grew silvery , the mockingbird retreated deeper into the orchard , and Mrs. Delahanty felt that the whole scene might be unreal , a mirage cast up into the present out of either the past or the future  --  that girls had sat in many a darkening room in years gone by and would so sit in the future ; but that " now , " the present minute , was unreal , only the past whisking by on its way to the future , or the future casting a long prophetic shadow to rearwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll put some more custard on your pudding you might be able to eat it . " " I beg your pardon , " said Jo . " Were you speaking to me ? " " Never mind , " Mrs. Delahanty told her . " I was only urging you to eat . " " Oh food ! " said Cress . " Food . Who cares about food ? " " I do , " said Bernadine . " Howie adores puddings . Willp279you copy down this recipe for me , Mrs. Delahanty ? I plan to serve Howie a different pudding every single night for thirty nights . I already have twenty-two recipes . " " Tapioca , jello , and bread , " said Jo , sing-songing . " If puddings be the food of love , cook on . " The mockingbird had ceased to sing . The leaves of the bougainvillaea vine which clambered over the dining-room wall rustled faintly . Mrs. Delahanty began taking the spoons from the serving dishes . Mr. Delahanty remarked in the voice of a man who has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendenhall says that Frank Cornelius had a bad hemorrhage this morning . " Mrs. Delahanty laid the spoons down , clattering . " Oh John ! " she said . " I understood he was getting better . " There was a note in her voice of condemnation , as if Mr. Cornelius had not tried hard enough , as if he were a turncoat , a traitor to his generation  --  and hers . When old people sickened and died , men and women in their seventiesand eighties , that was to be expected . But thirty-eight ! That was a direct threat to her and John . " I do n't think he 's taken very good care of himself , " Mr. Delahanty explained . " You ca n't throw off t.b . just by wishing . You 've got to co-operate , rest , stay put . I 've seen Cornelius about town off and on all spring . Baseball , things like that . Staggering around half-alive . I saw him yesterday , sitting along the road out by his place . Today , a hemorrhage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang to her feet , interrupting her father . " You must n't say that . You have no right to say that . " She pulled the daisies from the neck of her halter and passed them from hand to hand distractedly . " You do n't have any idea what it 's like to be dying . Do you ? " she insisted . Mr. Delahanty agreed instantly . " No , I do n't , Crescent . The worst I ever had was a touch of shingles . " " Do n't be funny , " Cress said , her chin quivering . " Do n't be funny about death . How can you understand how terrible it is for Mr. Cornelius to think he may die , no matter how much he takes care of himself ? And that if he does n't go out and see the sunshine and people and trees today he may never see them again . Never , never . And you were never a great athlete like Mr. Cornelius , so it 's a thousand times worse for him than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you blame him . You blame him for not giving in . You blame him , " she paused , trying to steady her voice . " I hate  --  I hate people who say cruel things like that . " She looked at her father and Mr. Delahantylooked back . Then she dropped her daisies onto her plate amidst the uneaten salmon and beets and ran from the room . Mrs. Delahanty , after the sound of the slammed door had stopped echoing , leaned over and began to gather up the daisies . The two girls excused themselves and left the room . " What did I say ? " Mr. Delahanty asked . " To cause all that ? "  |p281Mrs  . Delahanty continued without speaking to shake bits of food from the flowers . " Gertrude , did what I said sound cruel and hateful to you ? " " No , John , not to me , " she answered . " But then I 'm not in love with Mr. Cornelius . " In her bedroom , Cress sat on the floor , her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her shoulders , Jo 's by the weight and pressure , she said , " Go away , please go away and leave me alone . " The arm remained where it was . Jo knew , and so did Bernadine . Not much , because there was n't much to know , except that she had seen Mr. Cornelius three times to look at him and had spoken to him twice and that she loved him and would willingly die for him . There was " not much to know " in what was called the outside world ; but inside herself , in her dreams and imaginingsthere was nothing but Mr. Cornelius . She had decidedout of her experience of loving Mr. Cornelius that the knowledge people had of one another , parents of children , anyway , was almost nothing . She could sit at the dinner table with her father and mother , answering their questions about school , but being in reality thousands of miles away in some hot dry land nursing Mr. Cornelius back to health ; and her father and mother never noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Cornelius sometimes went away together , Mr. Cornelius saying , " Cress , withoutp282knowing it I have been searching for you all of my life . My sickness is no more than the sum of my disappointment , and without you I can never get well . " Sometimes in her dreams Mrs , Cornelius came to her and the gist of what she said was , " My life with Mr. Corneliushas been a failure . He has not many months to live . I do not want to stand between him and his happiness in the little time that is left . Go , with my blessing . " But for the most part Mrs. Cornelius and the Cornelius boys did not exist in her dreams ; even the world , as she knew it in what was called " real life , " was greatly altered ; or , perhaps , simplified . Changed , anyway , so that it consisted of nothing but sunshine , a background of sand or water , and a grassy or sandy bank against which Mr. Corneliusreclined , getting well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked to him . As a matter of fact , every thought in her mind had become part of an unending monologue directed toward the omnipresent mental image of Mr. Cornelius . Everything she saw immediately became words in a report to Mr. Cornelius ; and if , by chance , some experience was so absorbing as to momentarily obscure his image , she made up for it by living the whole scene through once again just for him . Sometimes she imagined that Mr. Cornelius kissed her . She had to be careful about these imaginings however . She had never been kissed , family did n't count , of course , and since she supposed that when you were kissed by the man you loved , the sensations were near to swooning , swooning was what she nearly did whenever she had imaginings of this kind.  |p283Most  often she simply helped Mr. Cornelius as he reclinedin the midst of the sunny simplified landscape , his thin beautiful face becoming tanned and fuller as his health improved ; but not more beautiful . That was impossible . She doted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other face she saw as pudgy and ill-shaped by comparison . In her dream she picked flowers for Mr. Cornelius , went to the library for him , read to him , smoothed his brow , sometimes kissed him and always , always gazed at him with enraptured eyes . But all the time she was imagining this life with Mr. Cornelius she suffered , becauseMr . Cornelius was dying and there was nothing she could do about it ; she suffered because she had feelings which she did not know how to express , suffered because she had put the core of her life outside its circumference . She sat up , and Jo took her arm away . It was still light enough to see Bernadine on the floor leaning against the bed , and Jo by her side . The pitcher of white stock on her desk reflected what light there was , like a moon . The room was quiet and warm and full of misery . " There is nothing you can do , Cress , " Jo said . " You love him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . All you can do is to endure it . " " I can do something , " Cress said . " What ? " Jo asked . " I can go to Mr. Cornelius and tell him I love him . " " Oh no , " Bernadine said , very shocked . " You ca n't do that . " " Why not ? " Cress asked  | " You do n't know whether he loves you or not . " " What does that have to do with it ? I 'm not going to him to ask him if he loves me . I 'm going to tell him that I love him . " " Is that what you really want to do , Cress ? " Jo asked . " No  --  if you mean by want to , do I feel good about going . I feel awful about going . It makes me feel sick to my stomach to even think about it . It gives me the shakes . " Jo once again put an arm around Cress 's shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernadine . " She 's shaking like a leaf . " " Look , Cress , " Bernadine said . " I 'm almost married myself . It 's just a matter of days . For all practical purposesI am married . You must think of Mr. Cornelius , Cress , and what he 'd feel . I know if Howie was sick and maybe dying he would n't want some other woman coming to his sick bed and saying , I love you . ' The first thing he 'd do , I , know , is say to me , Bernadine , throw this madwoman out . ' And that 's exactly what Mr. Cornelius is liable to say to you . " " I know it , " Cress said bleakly . " Well , then ? " Bernadine asked , pride of reasoning in her voice . " Are you still going ? " Cress huddled silent , unanswering . " It 's probably not a very kind thing to do , " Jo suggested in her deep , thoughtful voice . " Go to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh I know that . If I just asked myself what was kind I would never do it . But what has kindness got to do with love ? I 'm not doing it to be kind to Mr. Cornelius . I 'm doing it because I have to . " " Have to ? " Jo reminded her , steadily . " You do n't have to . Sit right here . Sit still . By morning everything will be different . " " By morning Mr. Cornelius may be dead . " " Well then , " Bernadine said , " all your problems will be over . Mr. Cornelius will be dead and you 'll be sad . But you wo n't have bothered him or made a fool of your-self . " " I do n't care about making a fool of myself . " " You do care . You 're still shaking . And think about Mrs. Cornelius . How 's she going to feel about someone barging in on her sick husband , making passionate declarationsof love ? " " It would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute I got there , I love you , Mr. Cornelius . ' Then leave . " " Cress , " Bernadine said , " what actually do you see yourself doing ? You get there , the whole family is around the bed , and doctors and priests too , maybe . What are your plans ? To say I beg your pardon but I 've a little message for Mr. Cornelius ' ? Then push your way through them all to the bedside , drop on your knee , kiss his wasted hand and say , Mr. Cornelius , I love you . ' Is that it ? " " Oh , do n't heckle her , Bernadine , " Jo said.  | " What I see myself doing , " said Cress , " is telling Mr. Cornelius something I have to tell him . " " How , " asked Bernadine , " do you see yourself getting there ? " Bernadine had Howie 's car while he was in the army and she had driven the girls home from school . " Do you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " Cress said . " O.K. , " Bernadine told her . " I 'll drive you . And let 's go right away and get it over with . " Mr. Cornelius was still living in the small one-room tent-house at the edge of the walnut grove in which his home stood . Here he was away from the noises of his family and was able to get the fresh air he needed . It was nine o'clock when Bernadine stopped the car in front of the Cornelius ranch . A dim light was burning inside the tent-house , but there was nothing to indicate the presence of the crowd of people she had prophesied . " Here we are , " she said , turning off the engine . Cress wished for any catastrophe , however great , which would prevent her from having to leave the car . She felt real hatred for Bernadine and Jo . Why , if they were convinced that she should n't come , had n't they remained steadfast ? What kind of friends were they , to give way to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about ? Why had they permitted her to go riding off into the night ? To tell a strange man she loved him ? True , she had n't told them where she was going nor that she loved a strange man . But what werep287parents for if not to understand without being told ? She blamed them for her fright and unhappiness . Still anything that happened would be better than continuing to live in a make-believe world in which she only dreamed that she told Mr. Cornelius she loved him . And she knew that if Bernadine were to start the car now she would jump out and run toward the tent-house and the declaration which would start her to living inside her dream . She opened the car door and stepped out into the night air which , after the warmth of the car , was damp and cold against her bare legs and arms . " Cheerio , " said Bernadine quite calmly as she was walking away from the car under the dark canopy of the big trees toward the dimly lighted room . Why was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on doing ? She stood at the screened door looking into the room as into a picture . Why did it seem like a picture ? The small number of furnishings ? Their neat arrangement , dresser balanced by table , chair by bed ? The light falling from a bulb , shaded by blue paper , so that part of the room was in deep shadow ? But most of all , was it picture-like because she had imagined the room and Mr. Cornelius for so long , that a frame had grown up about them in her mind ? Now , would it be possible to break that frame ? She opened the screen door , stepped into the room and became a part of the picture by that easy act . Mr. Cornelius lay on a high narrow bed . He lay very straight , his head supported by three or four pillows and his hands folded across an ice pack which he held to hisp288chest . His eyes were dosed and his face , in spite of his illness , was warm with color . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh Mr. Cornelius , she thought , I do truly love you and I have come'at last to tell you . Without opening his eyes Mr. Cornelius said , " Joyce , I think I 'm going to be sick . " Joyce . Cress was surprised at the name . It seemed too gentle for the bus driver . " It 's not Joyce , Mr. Cornelius , " Cress said . " It 's me . " Then Mr. Cornelius opened his eyes and Cress was enchantedall over again by the enormous blaze of being alive and searching and understanding which she saw there . " It 's Cress , " he said , in a very low careful voice , " the track-meet girl . " Then he closed his eyes . " I 'm going to be sick , " he said . " Hand me the basin . " The basin , Cress saw , was an enamel wash bowl on the night stand by the bed . She got it , put it on the bed beside Mr. Cornelius . " Help me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother had helped her when she was sick after her tonsils were out , by putting an arm around his shoulders and supporting him . " Do n't be scared , " Mr. Cornelius whispered . " It 's not a hemorrhage . I 'm just going to lose my supper . " He did and afterwards he lay back against his pillows for a minute or two , then he reached up his hand and rang the bell which was suspended from the headboard of his bed.  | " A glass of water , " he told Cress , and Cress was holding it for him to rinse his mouth when Mrs. Cornelius arrived . Mrs. Cornelius paid no more attention to her than if she 'd been some kind of device to help Mr. Cornelius  --  like the ice pack or the bell . She took the glass from Cress 's hand , slipped her arm around her husband 's shoulders and said , " Frank , Frank . Oh thank God , Frank , no more blood . Just your supper and that does n't matter . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . If you can swallow a bite or two later I 'll fix you another . How do you feel now , honey ? " Cress had backed away from the bed . Mrs. Cornelius was wearing a housecoat or dressing gown of deep red , lightened by wreaths of tiny yellow and white flowers . What she looked like now was not a General in the Russian army but Robert Louis Stevenson 's wife , " trusty , dusky , vivid and true with eyes of gold and bramble dew . " Her bosom , which had spoiled the lines of her chauffeur 's coat , was exactly right for pillowing an invalid 's head , and her chestnut hair , curled corkscrew crisp , said " Never give up , " as plain as any words , said " Fight on , " said " Defy the universe . " And all the time she was cradling Mr. Corneliusin her arms , and helping him rinse his mouth she was pressing her cheek to his hair and speaking comforting words through which there ran a mixture of laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty it , " she said top290Cress when Mr. Cornelius had finished rinsing his mouth . She handed the basin to Cress and nodded toward a door at the back of the room . Cress , ordinarily too squeamish to pull off her own Band-Aids , marched away with it without a word . When she returned Mr. Cornelius was once more against his pillows and Mrs. Cornelius was wiping his face with a damp cloth . " Where 'd you come from ? " she asked Cress as she took the basin from her . " From out there , " Cress said , nodding toward the road . " The girls are waiting for me . In the car , " she explained . Mrs. Cornelius paused in her washing . " What did you come for ? " she asked . Cress welcomed the question . It was a wonderful help , like the upward spring of the diving board against her feet when she was reluctant to take off into deep water . Though she no longer had so great a need to say what she had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she had come into the room ; what had been locked inside her and had been painful , because unsaid , had somehow , without a word being spoken , gotten itself partially expressed . She was not sure how . Nevertheless she had come to speak certain words . They were the answer to Mrs. Cornelius ' question . They were why she had come . So , louder than was necessary , and in a voice cracking with strain she said , " I came to tell Mr. Cornelius I loved him . " Then she turned , resolutely , and said the wordsp291directly to Mr. Cornelius . " Mr. Cornelius , I love you . " At that Mrs. Cornelius laughed , not jeering , not angry , not unbelieving , but in the soft delighted way of a person who has received an unexpected gift , a pleasure never dreamed of but one come in the nick of time and most acceptable . " Oh , Frankie , " she said , running her hand through Mr. Cornelius ' thick black hair , " look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got , " was what she 'd said as if , Cress thought , I 'd said I loved them both . And then , watching Mr. Cornelius reach for his wife 's hand , she saw that there was nothing she could give to Mr. Cornelius without givingit also to Mrs. Cornelius . Because they were not two separated people . They were really one , the way the Bible said . It was an astounding discovery . It was almost too much for her . It held her motionless and speculating . She felt as if her mind , by an infusion of light and warmth , was being forced to expand to accommodate this new idea . And it was an idea which , contrary to all her expectations , she liked . It was exactly what she wanted . Not Mr. Cornelius alone on a stretch of desert sand and she kissing his wasted hand  --  in spite of her six months ' dreaming . What she wanted was Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius . She was so happy for Mrs. Cornelius ' presence she almost took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was continuing her laughing murmur to her husband . " Frankie , " she said , " oh Frankie , you old jackanapes . You old irresistible . What 's all thisp292talk about being on your last legs ? Done for ? Caved in ? With school girls coming with professions of love ? Pretty school girls . Boy , we 're not cashing in our checks just yet . Not us . What 's your name , dear ? " she asked Cress . Mr. Cornelius answered in his low half-whispering voice . " She 's John Delahanty 's daughter , Crescent . They call her Cress at school . " " Well , " said Mrs. Cornelius . " I 've heard the boys mentionyou . Where 'd you see Frank ? " " At a track meet . " " I stared at her some , " Mr. Cornelius said . " Reminded me of you at her age . So alive . " " Was I ever like that ? " Mrs. Cornelius asked her husband . " That 's what I thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Mrs. Cornelius . " Oh yes . More than anyone there . More than the boys . I thought his eyes fed on the sights , " she said , daring the poetry of her thoughts . " Fed ? " Mrs. Cornelius studied the word then accepted it . " I see what you mean . Now Frank , " she said , " will you lie still and take care of yourself ? Unknown school girls loving you and wanting you to get well . You do , do n't you ? " she asked Cress . " Oh yes , " Cress said . " I was willing to die for him . " Her voice evidently convinced Mrs. Cornelius . " Oh Frank , " she said , " school girls willing to die for you and you not half trying . "  | " Mrs. Cornelius , " Cress said , wanting , since even partial confession made her feel so much better , to tell everything , " I ought to tell you something else . " She stumbled for words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I bet you planned to run away with Frank and nurse him back to health . " Cress was amazed . " Yes , " she said , her face burning with guilt and foolishness , " yes I did . How did you know ? " " Oh Frank , do n't it bring it all back to you ? No wonder you were reminded of me . I was going to run away with the minister , " she said turning to Cress . " Save him from his wife and family . And he was the most beautiful man in the world , Frank . You ca n't hold a candle to your father  --  never could . " Cress wanted to say something , but she could n't settle on what . She had too many emotions to express . Exhilarationat being released from the isolation of her dreaming ; relief to find that other girls had loved secretly too , but most of all joy to have acted , to have made for herself a single undivided world in which to live . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Cornelius . . . " " Cress , " asked Mrs. Cornelius , " can you play cards ? Or checkers ? " " Yes , " Cress said , " I can . I like to . " " And read out loud ? Of course you can do that , ca n't you ? Why do n't you come read to Frank ? And play cards with him ? It gets so darn lonesome for him . I work.  |p294The  boys work , and besides they have n't got enough patience to sit still . And the good people come in and tell Frank how their uncles or mothers passed away with consumption and for him to be resigned . He needs somebodyinterested in living , not dying . Would you come ? " " Oh yes . If you want me  --  if he wants me . I could come every day all summer . " " O.K. , " Mrs. Cornelius said , " we 'll plan on it . Now you 'd better run on . Frank 's had a bad day . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes were closed but he opened them at Mrs. Cornelius ' words and made a good-by flicker with the lids . " Good night , " Cress said . Mrs. Cornelius went to the door with her . " We 'll count on you , " she said once again and put a hand on Cress 's shoulder and gave her a kind of humorous loving shake before she turned away . Cress flew to the car propelled , it seemed , by the beat of her heart as a bird is propelled by the beat of its wings . The walnut leaves were alive and fluttering in the warm air and all about her mockingbirds were singing like nightingales . As she emerged from the grove she saw the June stars big and heavy-looking like June roses . This is the happiest hour of my life , she thought , and she yearned to do something lovely for the girls , something beautiful and memorable ; but all she could think of was to ask them to go to town for milk shakes.  | " I could stand some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . " " He was sick , " Cress explained , " and Mrs. Cornelius and I had to take care of him . " " Mrs. Cornelius ? Did she come out ? " " Of course , " Cress answered . " Would n't you , if Howie was sick ? " Bernadine had no answer to this . She started the car and after they had gone a mile or so Jo asked , " Did you tell him ? " " Of course . " " Does he love you ? " Bernadine asked . Cress felt sorry for Bernadine . " You 're a fine one to be getting married , " she said . " Of course he does n't . He loves Joyce . " " Joyce ? Who 's Joyce ? " " Mrs. Cornelius . I remind him some of her . I adore Mrs. Cornelius . She is like Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson and they are one person . Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius , I mean . They are truly married . I do n't suppose you understand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is for the one is for the other . I am going to help her take care of him this summer . Is n't that wonderful ? Maybe I can really help him get well . Is n't this the most gloriously beautiful night ? Oh , I think it 's the most significant night of my life . " The two girls were silent , but Cress was too full of her own emotions to notice . When they went into the soda fountain , she looked at their reflection in the mirror and liked what she saw.  |p296The  three of them had always been proud of one another . Bernadine had glamour , Jo character , and Cress personality ; that was the division they made of themselves . " Look at Bernadine , listen to Cress , and let Jo act , " someone had said . Oh , but I 've broken through that , Cress thought , I can act , too . She searched for some understandingof the part Mrs. Cornelius had played in that breakthrough . If she had said , " You wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible thing ? Would she have been pushed back , fearful , into the narrowness of dreaming , and into dreaming 's untruths ? She did n't know . She could n't hold her mind to such abstractions . " What we want , " she said to Lester Riggins , the boy at the fountain , " is simply the most stupendous , colossal , overpowering concoction you ever served . " " This a special night ? " Lester asked . " Super-special . " " How come ? " " Bernadine 's going to be married . " " Known that for six months . " " Jo 's been accepted for Stanford . With special praise . " " Old stuff . " " Then there 's me . " " What about you ? " " I 'm alive . " " That 's different , " Lester said . " Why did n't you tell me in the first place ? How do you like it ? " " Being alive ? Fine , " said Cress . " Better than shooting stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This obviously merits the Riggins ' special . Expense any issue ? " " No issue , " Cress said . He brought them something shaped , roughly , like the Eiffel Tower , but more dramatically colored . " Here it is , girls . Here 's to being alive ! " They sank their spoons in it and ate it down , their appetites equal to the whole of it , color , size , sweetness and multiplicity of ingredients. 301The steam from the kettle had condensed on the cold window and was running down the glass in tear-like trickles . Outside in the orchard the man from the smudge companywas refilling the pots with oil . The greasy smell from last night 's burning was still in the air . Mr. Delahanty gazed out at the bleak darkening orange grove ; Mrs. Delahanty watched her husband eat , nibbling up to the edges of the toast then stacking the crusts about his tea cup in a neat fence-like arrangement . " We 'll have to call Cress , " Mr. Delahanty said , finally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's his only grandchild . She ought to be here . " Mrs. Delahanty pressed her hands to the bones above her eyes . " Cress is n't going to like being called away from college , " she said . " We 'll have to call her anyway . It 's the only thing to do . " Mr. Delahanty swirled the last of his tea around in his cup so as not to miss any sugar . " Father 's liable to lapse into unconsciousness any time , " Mrs. Delahanty argued . " Cress 'll hate coming and Fatherp302wo n't know whether she 's here or not . Why not let her stay at Woolman ? " Neither wanted , in the midst of their sorrow for the good man whose life was ending , to enter into any discussion of Cress . What was the matter with Cress ? What had happened to her since she went away to college ? She , who had been open and loving ? And who now lived inside a world so absolutely fitted to her own size and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of her own grandfather , to be an unmerited invasion of her privacy . Black magic could not have changed her more quickly and unpleasantly and nothing except magic , it seemed , would give them back their lost daughter . Mr. Delahanty pushed back his cup and saucer . " Her place is here , Gertrude . I 'm going to call her long distancenow . She 's a bright girl and it 's not going to hurt her to miss a few days from classes . What 's the dormitory number ? " " I know it , as well as our number , " Mrs. Delahanty said . " But at the minute it 's gone . It 's a sign of my reluctance , I suppose . Wait a minute and I 'll look it up . " Mr. Delahanty squeezed out from behind the table . " Do n't bother . I can get it . " Mrs. Delahanty watched her husband , his usually square shoulders sagging with weariness , wipe a clear place on the steamy windowpane with his napkin . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little kitchen . " I ca n't ever remember having to smudge beforep303in February . I expect you 're right , " he added as he went toward the phone . " Cress is n't going to like it . " Cress did n't like it . It was February , the rains had been late and the world was burning with a green fire ; a green smoke rolled down the hills and burst shoulder-high in the cover crops that filled the spaces between the trees in the orange orchards . There had been rain earlier in the day and drops still hung from the grass blades , sickleshapedwith their weight . Cress , walking across the campus with Edwin , squatted to look into one of these crystal globes . " Green from the grass and red from the sun , " she told him . " The whole world right there in one raindrop . " " As Blake observed earlier about a grain of sand , " said Edwin . " O.K. , show off , " Cress told him . " You know it  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pulled her up , swingingher in a semi-circle in front of him . " Down there in the grass the world winked at me . " " Do n't be precious , Cress , " Edwin said . " I will , " Cress said , " just to tease you . I love to tease you , Edwin . " " Why ? " Edwin asked . " Because you love to have me , " Cress said confidently , taking his hand . Being older suited Edwin . She rememberedwhen she had liked him in spite of his looks ; but now spindly had become spare , and the dark shadow of his beard  --  Edwin had to shave every day while otherp304boys were still just fuzzy  --  lay under his pale skin ; and the opinions , which had once been so embarrassingly unlikeanyone else 's , were now celebrated at Woolman as being " Edwinian . " Yes , Edwin had changed since that day when she had knocked his tooth out trying to rescue him from the mush pot . And had she changed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and the freckles not noticeable except at the height of summer ? And with her new-found ability for light talk ? They were passing beneath the eucalyptus trees and the silver drops , falling as the wind shook the leaves , stung her face , feelingat once both cool and burning . Meadow larks in the fields which edged the campus sang in the quiet way they have after the rain has stopped . " Oh Edwin , " Cress said , " no one in the world loves the meadow lark 's song the way I do ! " " It 's not a competition , " Edwin said , " you against the world in an I-love-meadow-larks ' contest . Take it easy , kid . Love em as much as in you lieth , and let it go at that . " " No , " she said . " I 'm determined to overdo it . Listen , " she exclaimed , as two birds sang together . " Not grieving , nor amorous , nor lost . Nothing to read into it . Simply music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rain to listening ears . " She glanced at Edwin to see how he took this rhetoric . He took it calmly . She let go his hand and capered amidst the fallen eucalyptus leaves . " The gardener thinks you 've got St. Vitus ' dance , " Edwin said . Old Boat Swain , the college gardener whose name wasp305really Swain , was leaning on his hoe , watching her hopingand strutting . She did n't give a hoot about him or what he thought . " He 's old , " she told Edwin . " He does n't exist . " She felt less akin to him than to a bird or toad . There were lights already burning in the dorm windows . Cress could see Ardis and Nina still at their tables , finishing their Ovid or looking up a final logarithm . But between five and six most of the girls stopped trying to remember which form of the sonnet Milton had used or when the Congress of Vienna had met , and dressed for dinner . They got out of their sweaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew just what she was going to wear when she came downstairs at six to meet Edwin  --  green silk like the merman 's wife . They were going to the Poinsettia for dinner , escaping salmon-wiggle night in the college dining room . " At six , " she told him , " I 'll fly down the stairs to meet you like a green wave . " " See you in thirty minutes , " Edwin said , leaving her at the dorm steps . The minute she opened the door , she began to hear the dorm sounds and smell the dorm smells  --  the hiss and rush of the showers , the thud of the iron , a voice singing , " Dear old Woolman we love so well , " the slap of bare feet down the hall , the telephone ringing . And the smells ! Elizabeth Arden and Cashmere Bouquet frothing in the showers ; talcum powder fallingp306like snow ; Intoxication and Love Me and Devon Violet ; rubber-soled sneakers , too , and gym T-shirts still wet with sweat after basketball practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But while she was still listening and smelling , Edith shouted from the top of the stairs , " Long distance for you , Cress . Make it snappy . " Cress took the stairs three at a time , picked up the dangling receiver , pressed it to her ear . " Tenant calling Crescent Delahanty , " the operator said . It was her father : " Grandfather is dying , Cress . Catch the 7:30 home . I 'll meet you at the depot . " " What 's the matter  --  Cressie ? " Edith asked . " I have to catch the 7:30 Pacific Electric . Grandfather 's dying . " " Oh poor Cress , " Edith cried and pressed her arm about her . Cress scarcely heard her . Why were they calling her home to watch Grandpa die , she thought , angrily and rebelliously . An old man , past eighty . He 'd never been truly alive for her , never more than a rough , hot hand , a scraggly mustache that repelled her when he kissed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stones and kept them washed and polished , to turn over and admire . It was silly and unfair to make so much of his dying . But before she could say a word , Edith was telling the girls . They were crowding about her . " Do n't cry , " they said . " We 'll pack for you . Be brave , darling Cress . Re/member your grandfather has had a long happy life . He would n't want you to cry . " " Brave Cress  --  brave Cress , " they said . " Just frozen . " She was n't frozen . She was determined . She was not going to go . It did not make sense . She went downstairs to meet Edwin as she had planned , in her green silk , ready for dinner at the Poinsettia . The girls had told him . " Are you wearing that home ? " he asked . " I 'm not going home , " she said . " It 's silly and useless . I ca n't help Grandfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do him , sitting there at home ? " " He might do you some good , " Edwin said . " Had you thought about that ? " " Why , Edwin ! " Cress said . " Why , Edwin ! " She had the girls tamed , eating out of her hand , and here was Edwin who loved her  --  he said so , anyway  --  cold and disapproving . Looking at herself through Edwin 's eyes , she hesitated . " Go on , " Edwin said . " Get what you need and I 'll drive you to the station . " She packed her overnight bag and went with him ; there did n't seem  --  once she 'd had Edwin 's view of herself  --  anything else to do . But once on the train her resentment returned . The Pacific Electric was hot and smelled of metal and dusty plush . It clicked past a rickety Mexican settlement , through La Habra and Brea , where the pool hall signs swung in the night wind off the ocean . An old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with herp308hair straggling through the holes in her broken net , sat in front of her . Neat , thought Cress , anyone can be neat , if he wants to . Her father , bareheaded , but in his big sheepskin jacket , met her at the depot . It was after nine , cold and raw . " This is a sorry time , Cress , " he said . He put her suitcasein the back of the car and climbed into the driver 's seat without opening the door for her . Cress got in , wrapped her coat tightly about herself . The sky was clear , the wind had died down . " I do n't see any sense in my having to come home , " she said at last . " What good can I do Grandpa ? If he 's dying , how can I help ? " " I was afraid that was the way you might feel about it . So was your mother . " " Oh Mother , " Cress burst out . " Recently she 's always trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off . " That 'll be about enough , Cress . Your place is at home and you 're coming home and keeping your mouth shut , whatever you think . I do n't know what 's happened to you recently . If college does this to you , you 'd better stay home permanently . " There was nothing more said until they turned up the palm-lined driveway that led to the house . " Here we are , " Mr. Delahanty told her . Mrs. Delahanty met them at the door , tired and haggardin her Indian design bathrobe . " Cress , " she said , " Grandfather 's conscious now . I toldp309him you were coming and he 's anxious to see you . You 'd better go in right away  --  this might be the last time he 'd know you . " Cress was standing by the fireplace holding first one foot then the other toward the fire . " Oh Mother , what am I to say ? " she asked . " What can I say ? Or does Grandfatherjust want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if with pain . " Are n't you sorry your grandfather 's dying , Cress ? Have n't you any pity in your heart ? Do n't you understand what death means ? " " He 's an . old man , " Cress said obstinately . " It 's what we must expect when we grow old . " Though she , of course , would never grow old . " Warm your hands , Cress , " her mother said . " Grandfather'sthroat bothers him and it eases him to have it rubbed . I 'll give you the ointment and you can rub it in . You wo n't need to say anything . " Cress slid out of her coat and went across the hall with her mother to her grandfather 's room . His thin old body was hardly visible beneath the covers ; his head , with its gray skin and sunken eyes , lay upon the pillow as if bodiless . The night light frosted his white hair , but made black caverns of his closed eyes . " Father , " Mrs. Delahanty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't move . There was nothing except the occasionalhoarse rasp of an indrawn breath to show that he was alive . Mrs. Delahanty pulled the cane-bottomed chair a littlep310closer to the bed . " Sit here , " she said to Cress , " and rub this into his throat and chest . " She opened her father 's nightshirt so that an inch or two of bony grizzled chest was bared . " He says that this rubbing relieves him , even if he 's asleep or too tired to speak . Rub it in with a slow steady movement . " She went out to the living room leavingthe door a little ajar . Cress sat down on the chair and put two squeamish fingers into the jar of gray ointment ; but she could see far more sense to this than to any talking or being talked to . If they had brought her home from school because she was needed in helping to care for Grandpa , that she could understand  --  but not simply to be present at his death . What had death to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with eyes shut , dipping her fingers often into the gray grease . The rhythm of the rubbing , the warmth and closeness of the room , after the cold drive , had almost put her to sleep when the old man startled her by lifting a shaking hand to the bunch of yellow violets Edith had pinned to the shoulder of her dress before she left Woolman . She opened her eyes suddenly at his touch , but the old man said nothing , only stroked the violets awkwardly with a trembling forefinger . Cress unpinned the violets and put them in his hand . " There , Grandpa , " she said , " there . They 're for you . " The old man 's voice was a harsh and faltering whisper and to hear what he said Cress had to lean very close.  | " I used to  --  pick them  --  on Reservoir Hill . I was alwayssorry to  --  plow them up . Still  --  so sweet . Thanks , " he said , " to bring them . To remember . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a pause . He closed his eyes , holding the bouquet against his face , letting the wilting blossoms spray across one cheek like a pulled-up sheet of flowering earth . He said one more word , not her name but her grandmother 's . The dikes about Cress 's heart broke . " Oh Grandpa , I love you , " she said . He heard her . He knew what she said , his fingers returned the pressure of her hand . " You were always so good to me . You were young and you loved flowers . " Then she said what was her great discovery . " And you still do . You still love yellow violets , Grandpa , just like me . " At the sound of her uncontrolled crying , Mr. and Mrs. Delahanty came to the door . " What 's the matter , Cress ? " Cress turned , lifted a hand toward them . " Why did n't you tell me ? " she demanded . And when they did n't answer , she said , " Edwin knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather 's outstretched hand and said something , evidently to him , which neither her father nor her mother understood . " It 's just the same . "
