The noisy fighting stirred up by congressional investigations into campus Communism grew even louder last week . But according to the booing and cheering , spectators outside the actual ring were throwing some of the best punches . <P> Few observers even tried to deny that Congress has the right to investigate colleges or anything else it chooses . But several spectators , including Methodist Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam , Unitarian Dr. A. Powell Davies and the Very Rev. Francis B. Sayre Jr. , Dean of Washington Cathedral , cried " foul " at the tactics of the investigators . Despite the continuing uproar , Representative Harold H. Velde and his House Un-American Activities Committee went to work . <P> Much or Little . In the committee room , where the main bout took place , there was an air of determined calm . Robert Gorham Davis , Smith College English professor and first witness at the open hearings , patiently repeated a personal history . He had joined the Communist Party in 1937 while teaching at Harvard ; two years later , disillusioned by the Nazi-Soviet pact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to recruit faculty members , not to influence students . Now , in his opinion , " the influence of Communists is very slight " on the teaching profession . With some reluctance , the slim , spectacled teacher identified in the public hearing former fellow Communists about whom he had already testified in private . <P> Among those named by Davis , Author Granville ( The Great Tradition ) Hicks testified about his own disappointing romance with Communism . Said Hicks : " ... I would go along with Senator Taft in feeling that I would not want to make an absolute rule . . . There are situations in which it would be better to let a Communist keep his teaching job than to disrupt the whole fabric of academic freedom . " But if a Communist brought his politics into the classroom , that was something else again . The trouble with all these investigations , Hicks continued , is that the emphasis always falls on " how much " the Communists have infiltrated American colleges . It might be better , said he , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country is in part a very real and understandable fear of the Soviet Union and its agents . . . Over and above that , I think there is a mood of rather vague apprehension that is not rational and that is dangerous , and . . . that mood of irrational apprehension has been encouraged in part by congressional-I will say legislative investigating committees . . . " <P> Said Representative Francis Walter : " I am inclined to agree with you that we are exaggerating the situation now . " <P> Old Refusal , New Twist . The hostile witnesses , however , won no one 's sympathy . Invoking the First and Fifth Amendments , Harvard Physics Professor Wendell H. Furry refused to talk when asked whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist Party . And to the old refusal he added a new twist . Once his interrogation was over , he issued a press statement . He wanted to assure his friends , said Furry , carefully watching his tenses , that he is not now a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injure the U.S.
