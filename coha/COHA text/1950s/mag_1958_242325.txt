THE SUMMER LOVERS ( 307 pp. ) - Hollis Alpert-Knopf ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> This first novel portrays the summer season at what might be called Loose Ends , Long Island , where there is plenty of sun , sea , sand , sex and susceptibility . Through the dazzle of hot days and perfervid nights moves Sally Pierce , a golden-glowing , nubile 19-year-old whose life is complicated by the fact that her divorced mother has remarried . Stepfather Andrew Wells is the sort of pipe-smoking , tweedy adult to make a Radciiffe girl 's heart do nip-ups . To complete the idyl , there are two other men : Chris , a callow college graduate ; and Chadburn , a hesitant illustrator . The question : Who will get Sally ? The answer : nearly everybody . <P> When Sally is not bounding from bed to bed , she is asking the sort of defiant , wide-eyed questions that , in fiction anyway , have such a devastating effect on grownups . She is also a determined kiss-and-tell girl , and after sleeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the household . Mother proves the most understanding of the lot , but young Chris is outraged . Says he : " You 're too much for me . You look so normal , but you 're as mixed up as any of them ! " To prove his own normality , he abandons the pursuit of Sally and makes a determined pass at Mom . <P> Author Alpert , 41 , who has written for magazines as dissimilar as The New Yorker and Seventeen , has some difficulty totting up the reasons for Sally 's amoral behavior . He gets in a few licks at " progressive " education , cuttingly describes the " intellectual bohemianism " of Sally 's environment , and then seems to veer to a primitive belief that women lack souls-or , at any rate , consciences . At summer 's end all of the men have in a sense been used up and thrown away . The women , as usual , are in control . All in all , the book is satisfactory seashore entertainment . Anyone reading it on certain Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters-if not the plot-all around him in the sand .
