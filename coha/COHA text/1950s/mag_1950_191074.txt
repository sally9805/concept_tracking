Twice in every 1,000 births , some unhappy mother finds that she has borne a child suffering from an affliction which has been misnamed " Mongolian idiocy . " In the 85 years since mongolism was defined , authorities have disagreed widely as to its cause . No speculation seemed too absurd . Mongolism , said some , looking at the slanted eyes of its victims , was racial evidence of " the Mongol in our midst . " Others , more responsible , argued that it was caused by " advanced maternal age , " exhaustion of the womb , ovarian disorders , an upset gland ( any gland would do ) or , finally , heredity . <P> Last week , a keen-minded Harvard physician offered the most convincing explanation yet of mongolism . It seems , said Dr. Theodore H. Ingalls at the New York Academy of Medicine , to be the result of an injury or shock to the fetus at about the eighth week of pregnancy . This does not mean that the cause is always the same type of injury or shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with researchers who have been looking for a single , simple cause is that they were like the three blind men describing an elephant : one found it all foot , another all trunk , the third all tail . <P> Eyes , Ears &; Nose . All victims of mongolism have three things in common : 1 ) mental deficiency , 2 ) short heads , 3 ) faces which seem to have been flattened ( actually , growth is arrested ) . Besides these constants , other defects are found so often in mongolism that Dr. Ingalls got a vital clue from analyzing them : the ears are usually malformed , there may be opacities in the eye lens , one of the nasal bones is usually absent , and the middle phalanx of the fifth finger is generally stunted . The clue : all these signs affect tissues which develop at about the eighth week of fetal life . In mongolism victims , the body structures formed earlier than that are usually normal , said Dr. Ingalls , and so are those formed later . <P> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been blighted by what might be called intrauterine drought . . . It may be a metabolic drought , a biochemical upset , transient vitamin or enzyme deficiency , or oxygen lack . " The likelihood that oxygen shortage may be the villain in many cases is heightened , said Dr. Ingalls , by the fact that mongolism often results from a pregnancy marked by early vaginal bleeding , and this bleeding might starve the fetal brain of oxygen . <P> Skull , Lip &; Palate . To test his theory , Dr. Ingalls and colleagues at Harvard 's School of Public Health took 300 mice in batches of 20 , subjected them to oxygen lack ( artificial " high altitude " ) for five hours on certain days of their pregnancies . Mice , unlike men , do not suffer from mongolism . But Dr. Ingalls found skull defects ( actually worse than mongolism ) in about a third of the litters which had been starved of oxygen on the eighth day of development . Lack of oxygen on the twelfth day gave them harelip , on the 14th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
