To the Burbank Daily Review , one of California 's smallest dailies ( circ. 4,421 ) , came a wire last week from the community 's biggest advertisers : Burbank 's twelve auto dealers . Complaining that the paper 's " continued headlining " of recession news " induces retrenching of possible buyers , " the telegram from Burbank 's Automobile Dealers Association announced that members were canceling their ad contracts with the paper . Said the wire : " This organization will not compete in advertising on the inside with adverse headlines on the outside . " Though the loss of business was a heavy blow , Review Publisher Hoyt Cater , whose paper appears in a town where thousands of aircraft workers are out of jobs , defiantly ran the telegram on Page One . Retorted he : " The Review is going to go right on publishing the news . When it 's good news , we 'll be very happy to print it . But when it 's bad , I 'm afraid we 'll have to print that too .
