I was riding a handy , sure-footed grey Arab polo pony . We wheeled and began to gallop . . . Bright flags appeared as if by magic , and I saw arriving from nowhere Emirs on horseback . . . The Dervishes appeared to be ten or twelve deep at the thickest , a great grey mass gleaming with steel . They seemed to be wild with excitement , dancing about on their feet , shaking their spears up and down . . . I found myself surrounded . I fired . . . Three or four men from my troop were missing . . . Trumpets were sounded . . . Two squadrons were dismounted and in a few minutes their fire . . . compelled the Dervishes to retreat . . . <P> Thus Winston Churchill , a dashing young subaltern in the 21st Lancers , describes the Battle of Omdurman , one of those minor actions which made the British Empire great in the days of Queen Victoria .
