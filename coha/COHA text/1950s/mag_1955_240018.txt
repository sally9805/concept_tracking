Damn Yankees ( book by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop ; music &; lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross ) involves most of the team that turned out The Pajama Game . This time baseball is their target , and with pretty nearly as happy results . Under George Abbott 's direction , there is a constant sense of zip , an occasional effect of explosion . There is plainly a belief that all music aspires toward a brass band 's exuberance , all locomotion toward a fire engine 's clanging speed . And there is a very proper belief that one Gwen Verdon is the equal of a hand-picked chorus line , a spotlighted siren , a surefire comic , and a sought-after premire danseuse . <P> Damn Yankees tells of a fanatical middle-aged rooter for the Washington Senators who mutters that he 'd sell his soul to have them take the pennant from the Yankees . At once a buyer with a cloven hoof appears , and transforms beefy Joe Boyd into lithe , 22-year-old Joe Hardy , the greatest ballplayer of all time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal ; and to keep Joe from escaping his clutches , the Devil puts redheaded Miss Verdon to work as an enchantress . <P> Though she pretty much fails with Joe , she lays waste the audience . Topping her Can-Can triumph , she dances superbly - never more so than when she spoofs ; she slinks and invites and caresses , kicks up her heels , swings her legs , coils and uncoils her hips , sends garments flying-all the while singing such ditties as Whatever Lola Wants . . . Lola Gets . She wears a double crown : no one can make sex more seductive , or more hilarious . <P> Ray Walston is a first-rate Devil . Disdaining pitchfork theatrics , he is a provokingly cool customer even when buying souls , with a tart , casual manner and a fine , stylish unwholesomeness . As Joe Hardy . Stephen Douglass does all that is required of him - bats .524 for the Senators , sings very well for the show . Richard Adler-Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse 's dances have hardly more than the outdoor virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And William and Jean Eckart 's sets are amusing and crisp . <P> Damn Yankees is less perfectly sustained than The Pajama Game ; it slows down in places , or to keep fast , turns choppy . And it may disappoint people who find baseball a bore . For all others , however , the long jinx on baseball as a stage theme has been broken at last by the high jinks of a good , gay show .
