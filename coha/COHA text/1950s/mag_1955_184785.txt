From Tokyo 's Ministry of Justice last week came an ominous announcement : starting next January , Japanese police will investigate " all activities-both public and private-of foreign residents . " The announcement meant that the Japanese government was putting teeth in the tough new tax rules laid down for foreigners by Finance Minister Hisato Ichimada , and was planning to use the police to get reports on everything from house rent to laundry bills . It was further harsh evidence of worsening relations between U.S. businessmen and the Japanese government . <P> Under Minister Ichimada 's new rules , U.S. businessmen in Japan will pay up to 65% tax on all income , whether earned in Japan or elsewhere , e.g. , stock dividends received in the U.S. are taxable . Headlined Tokyo 's big ( circ. more than 4,000,000 ) Asahi Shimbun : NEW TAXES MAKE FOREIGN BLUE EYES POP . <P> The word " pop " was an understatement . After slamming the door on more capital investment by U.S. companies last winter ( TIME , Dec. 20 et seq . ) , Japan now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. businessmen as well . Even for low-income businessmen the rates are prohibitive , e.g. , a $6,000-a-year businessman with three dependents must pay $2,639 in taxes v. some $600 in the U.S. On a $20,000 salary , the bite is $12-680 v. about $4,124 at home . <P> Unequal Equality . Finance Minister Ichimada has decided to cancel the favorable tax deal given foreigners since 1951 , make everyone pay the same stiff tax as Japanese . While that sounds fair , U.S. businessmen in Japan complain bitterly that the treatment they get is far from equal . Though many Japanese businessmen make big salaries , ride around in Cadillacs and spend freely , only a handful ( 400 in 1954 ) declare salaries as high as $15,000 a year . An executive in a big firm may declare a weekly salary of $100-and pay taxes on it . But his salary is only the beginning . He may get another $100 a week cash from a secret " expense " fund which many Japanese companies maintain . At night he rides home in a company-owned car , for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , his wife buys her clothes on a company charge account , the family food comes from company cafeterias , his son goes to college on a company scholarship . <P> Few Japanese businessmen get into trouble with the taxmen over such dodges . But no U.S. businessman wants to take the legal risk . In any event , under a new U.S.-Japanese tax agreement , Japanese tax collectors will be able to ship any doubtful tax returns to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in Washington for a quick double check against tax returns made by the businessman 's home office . <P> The Smell of ' 35 . Recently the U.S. Chamber of Commerce held a meeting with Japanese tax officials , hoping to work out a compromise . But the businessmen got only a vague promise that Finance Minister Ichimada would " study the situation . " Most think that Ichimada will use the new tax rules to weed out the U.S. business community in Japan by applying them leniently or harshly depending on the individual businessman .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
