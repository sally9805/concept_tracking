The British Museum of Natural History was in grateful receipt last week of a strange new gift-500,000 Mallophaga , the world 's leading collection of bird lice . <P> The donor of the collection is 73-year-old Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen , D.S.O. , late of the Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry , who first took up his odd pursuit in 1928 , after more than 25 years spent in fighting the Empire 's battles , from skirmishes in India to the trenches of World War I. Instead of retiring to his London town house , which bristles with lion and panther heads , he teamed up with his young cousin , Zoologist Theresa Clay , and mounted an offensive against the Mallophaga . He and Theresa believe that the lice can be used as a small-scale model of animal evolution . <P> The Best Muslin . Over the years , the colonel and his cousin have scoured the world for bird lice , visiting Syria , Africa , India , Arctic Russia , Estonia , Afghanistan , Arabia and Arizona . As soon as pack horses or native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonel strolls out with his shotgun . As each bird bites the dust , he wraps it carefully in many folds of " the best butter muslin . " When the bird 's body begins to cool , the lice desert it for the muslin . Then the colonel and Theresa unwrap the muslin and shelter the displaced lice in labeled vials of alcohol . <P> Mallophaga are not beautiful . Many are pinhead size ; the largest are only about one-quarter-inch long . But they have exploited their universe , the feathered outsides of birds , with commendable perseverance . <P> The Clever Guests . When the first birds appeared some 130 million years ago , say the colonel and Zoologist Clay , they offered an " unoccupied ecological niche " : i.e. , a place where some organism might manage to scratch out a living . Almost at once an ancient louse moved in , finding the feathers and skin debris a convenient source of food . As the early birds evolved into separate species , their lice evolved too , adapting themselves cleverly to each change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skylarks and ostriches . The extinct dodo and giant moa were undoubtedly lousy , too . <P> Lice , therefore , are often an indication of relationship between species . Often two kinds of birds that look very different to man appear much the same from a louse 's point of view . If the birds are infested by similar lice , there is a good chance that they descended from a common ancestor . Certain lice carried by flamingos , for instance , indicate that flamingos are related to ducks and not related to storks . There is not much chance that flamingos recently picked up duck lice . Lice are timid pioneers , and only rarely colonize unfamiliar birds . <P> The Travelers . About 4,000 species of Mallophaga are already known-far more than are needed to fit all the special niches . So , many of the species must have been formed by such evolutionary forces as change of environment . Because each kind of louse is limited to certain birds , it is easy for groups of lice to get out of touch with the main body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as a desert or mountain range , the lice they carry become like animals living on an island . They often change in the course of time , as island animals do .
