Like most males then and since , George Washington did his best to squirm out of having his picture done . It took all the prodding and blandishments of his wife Martha to make him agree to have " his likeness limned " for the first time . Giving in . Washington said : " Very well , Madam , but only if you and your children have your likenesses taken at the same time . " As a result , Painter Charles Willson Peale was summoned from Annapolis in May 1772 to paint the hero of the French and Indian War , his wife and stepchildren . Peale 's portrait of the 40-year-old Virginia planter in his uniform as a colonel in the Virginia militia , today hanging at Washington and Lee University , has become part of the national heritage. * <P> Last week the Mount Vernon Museum put on display a long-out-of-sight miniature , claiming it to be the very one that Martha Washington sat for as her part of the bargain ( of the three miniatures Peale painted of Martha between 1772 and 1791 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known ) ' . Mount Vernon 's small , 1 ? - in. - by- 1- in. oval likeness framed in a gold pendant ( see cut ) was acquired from G. Freeland Peter Jr . of Charlottesville , Va. , a direct descendant of Martha Custis Washington . Tradition has it that Washington actually wore the pendant during the Revolutionary War campaigns . Said Mount Vernon Director Charles Cecil Wall : " We think this miniature should be the recognized portrait of Martha Washington-the way the American people should remember her , instead of as a grey-haired old lady with a fussy cap . " <P> In nearby Williamsburg , Va. , another lady Washington also admired ( though presumably from afar ) showed up last week , with the discovery in a private collection of another Charles Willson Peale portrait-this one of Actress Nancy Hallam , one of America 's first glamour girls . The portrait , unidentified for more than a century , shows Actress Hallam playing the role of Imogen in Shakespeare 's Cymbeline . Hailed as " superfine " by a contemporary theatergoer , and not above playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , Nancy and her charms lured Washington to the theater five times in one week . <P> Williamsburg will hang its newly acquired picture of Nancy , who later married a church organist in Jamaica , in its Raleigh Tavern . This is fitting enough , since George dined there before going to the theater , and Nancy herself must have been no stranger . <P> <P> *In later years the two men 's friendship ripened . Washington sat seven times for portraits ; Peale in turn made a set of false teeth for Washington , using elk 's teeth set in lead .
