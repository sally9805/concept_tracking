For 40 years primary elections in California have been colossal exercises in political confusion . Under a cross-filing law adopted in 1913 , Republicans and Democrats filed freely in each other 's primaries , and the voters could never tell from the ballot which candidate came from what party . As a result , many a candidate said as little as possible about his party affiliation , and won both sides of the primary . Last week Californians went to the polls under a new primary law and set a different pattern . <P> Under the new law , candidates must be labeled ( " Rep. " or " Dem . " ) on all primary ballots . Thus a Republican running in the Democratic primary is clearly recognizable as an interloper , as is a Democrat in a G.O.P. primary . In 1952 , under the old law , 14 candidates won both nominations for the U.S. House of Representatives . Last week , under the new law , only two scored double victories . In 1950 four candidates for top state offices won both nominations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Democrat holding a major state office - was able to do so . U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel and Governor Goodwin J. Knight , Republicans , failed to match the double primary victories of Governor Earl Warren in 1946 and U.S. Senator William Knowland in 1952 . <P> Sponsored by Democrats , the new law proved to be a boon to its sponsors . For a reason no one has adequately explained , Republicans have won more dual nominations than Democrats under the old law , although Democrats have a 3-2 edge in registrations . This time Democrats campaigned hard . Their best slogan : " Do n't let two million Republicans fool three million Democrats . " For the first time in 40 years Democrats were able to nominate a full slate of their own candidates . <P> But the figures were not clear cause for Democratic jubilance . Republicans generally did far better on the Democratic ballot than Democrats did on the G.O.P. ticket , and the Republicans ' total two-party vote was substantially higher . For governor , the count was : on the Republican ticket , well-known Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic ticket , Graves 791,777 , Knight 667,375 . The primary results indicated that the dual primary victories will become a rarity , but they did not show that the G.O.P. was losing its grip in California . Best proof : Knight 's two-party total was the largest primary vote ever cast for a candidate for governor . <P> Among other notable results : In the Sixth Congressional District ( northeast of Berkeley ) , Democratic Representative Robert L. Condon was renominated , although he had been 1 ) barred from an atom-bomb test in Nevada last year by the Atomic Energy Commission as a " security risk , " and 2 ) disowned by the Democratic National Committee . <P> In Los Angeles Mrs. Mildred Younger , 33 , the " glamour girl " of the 1952 G.O.P.
