Millions of Americans remember him best as a television star , a skinny , wrathful old man with the fervor of an evangelist . For weeks in 1951 , as the Kefauver crime investigation held the U.S. public spellbound before their TV sets , New Hampshire 's Senator Charles William Tobey stole scene after scene from Estes Kefauver , Rudolph Halley and the parade of squirming gangsters and sweating politicians . Tobey 's righteous anger touched a responsive public nerve . Most of the watching public wanted , as Tobey did . to cut the gangsters down to size . His Yankee homilies , Bible quotations and Latin cliches were from another era , a fresh New Hampshire breeze in the midst of the sordid drama . <P> " It Is High Time . " Glaring from under his celebrated green eyeshade , Tobey looked like a New England schoolmaster , scolding his knuckleheaded pupils . " Fairy tales ! More fairy tales ! " he snorted . " Smells unto heaven . " " You 're playing ducks and drakes with us ! " When he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was goaded by Tobey 's needling into admitting that he was a bookmaker-an admission that led indirectly to Erickson 's jail sentence . And Frank Costello was all but beneath Tobey 's frosty contempt . " What have you ever done for your country ? " Tobey thundered-and listened contemptuously to Costello 's halting reply : " I pay my taxes . " <P> When Tobey exhorted the nation to rise above sin and return to its virtuous old ways , he evoked the faint tinkle of a Salvation Army tambourine . " When the hearts of men and women are touched , " he cried , " they take their inspiration from the Master of Men , and then we will have . . . in this nation a nation in which dwelleth righteousness-and before God it is high time . " No one doubted Tobey 's sincerity ; he spoke from the heart . Once , he was so moved by his own eloquence that he burst into tears . <P> A true son of New England , Tobey became a chicken farmer in Temple , N. H. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin School in 1895 . On winter mornings he sent his four children off to school with fresh-baked potatoes clenched in their hands to ward off frostbite . Summer afternoons Tobey invited his neighbors over for an outdoor hymn-sing , which he always led , pounding the old upright piano and rolling out the words in a stentorian baritone . In 1910 in Boston , after hearing Charles Evans Hughes denounce political corruption , Tobey was so impressed that he followed Hughes 's carriage around the city in a daze . Then &; there he decided to leave the chickens and go after the dragons of politics . <P> " If He Tells the Truth . " He never lost an election . For two of his six years in the state house of representatives , he was speaker ; for both of his two years in the state senate , he was senate president . In 1930 , when he was governor , Tobey uncovered a scandal ( the widespread practice of corporal punishment ) in a New Hampshire asylum for delinquent girls and deposed the institution 's board chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Senate in 1939 . When Senator Tobey blocked the appointment of Oilman Edwin Pauley as Under Secretary of the Navy , Harry Truman wrote him an angry letter , scrawled " Come and see me " across the bottom . " Who does he think he is ? " sputtered Tobey . " Mae West ? "
