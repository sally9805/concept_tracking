Once upon a time , there was a boxing manager who was so honest that to keep himself in coffee and cakes he also had to run a gymnasium that catered to hopeful fist fighters . ( No spitting on the floor , put cigar butts in cuspidors . ) There he developed a surefire system for picking winners . " Their built do n't matter so much , " Bobby Gleason liked to explain . " What they got ta be if they want to get along in this racket is a little stupid . " <P> Stupid may be a harsh word for the hard-muscled men who get paid for beating each other 's brains out for the television audience , but all last month it seemed a mild word indeed for the men who really cash in on the boxing racket . Managers , seconds , two-bit camp followers and big-shot promoters trooped down to the New York State Athletic Commission to put on a command performance for Julius Helfand , New York 's crusading new commission chairman , and showed all the symptoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been nothing like it since 1951 , when Gambler Frank Costello told Senator Estes Kefauver : " I want to testify truthfully and my mind do n't function . " <P> No Address . Commissioner Helfand could hardly have been surprised . A onetime racket-busting assistant district attorney in Brooklyn , he has been around long enough to know that buying a piece of a fighter is one sure way to buy underworld class-it gives a guy the taint of respectability . So when Helfand tried to find out why a slick young welterweight named Vince Martinez was getting the brushoff from matchmakers , it was not exactly news that witnesses began to mumble about a Murder Inc. alumnus named Frankie Carbo . <P> Everybody knew Frankie-in a way . James D. Norris , millionaire president of the International Boxing Club-which is the heart , pocketbook and sordid soul of American prize fighting-had known him for 20 years . Used to dunk doughnuts with him , as a matter of fact . What did Frankie do for a living ? Well , Jim Norris would n't know about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else knew much about Carbo , either . Such assorted characters as Hymie ( " The Mink ' ' ) Wallman and Willie ( " The Undertaker " ) Ketchum , a sullen pair of part-time managers , had heard that Frankie was interested in boxing-but never from Frankie , of course . Never nothing from Frankie . Wallman , who had invited Carbo to each of his three daughters ' weddings , did not even know his friend 's address . How were the invitations delivered ? Well , Frankie and The Mink just happened to " bunk " into each other . <P> No Change . It was a frustrating performance , but Helfand piled up enough points to feel justified in setting down " Honest " Bill Daly , the manager who collaborated with the IBC in giving Vince Martinez a rough deal . Last week Helfand suspended his hearings and sailed for Europe . From Jacobs Beach to The Bronx , he left behind a mob of worried wise guys , convinced that this boxing commissioner meant business . They would have to mend their ways - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves . But there was no hope for any real change . By the nature of things , professional boxing was still the racket in which it is necessary to be a little stupid - and more than a little forgetful , especially on the witness stand .
