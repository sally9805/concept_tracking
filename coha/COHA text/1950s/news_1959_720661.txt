He appeared in separate prerecorded radio-TV interviews with Republican Senators Karl Mundt of South Dakota and Kenneth B. Keating of New York . Mr. Nixon was in Chicago today . Broadcast Plan Dropped The Vice President had canceled an earlier plan for a nation-wide broadcast after returning from abroad , so today 's programs were , in a sense , his first report to the nation , other than commentaries for newsreels . Mr. Nixon said Mr. Khrushchev had many mistaken impressions of the United States . In response to a question by Senator Keating , he said that a visit to the United States by the Soviet Premier would give him an opportunity to " remove some of the miscalculations he has with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of Mr. Khrushchev 's views // was based on his conversations I with him . " I think he believes that ? 1 he 's been told by his agents here ) I that ? this country is divided , that they do n't support the firm stand the President takes in Berlin and in other parts of the , world , " reported the Vice Presi-dent , " I think he believes that this country is weak economically , or at least becoming weak , that we are on the downgrade . I think he believes that there are millions of people , workers in this country who are just waiting for the time they can throw out the present system of government and institute something along the lines of the socialist or communist state . " " Now if he comes here , he 's going to see that all these things are n't true , " added Mr. Nixon .

We 'll concede that in some areas you may be ahead of us , but on the other hand , in some areas we are ahead of you , and we both must recognize that neither has the power to knock the other out . And that if anybody starts anything in today 's world it will bring upon the aggressor terrible destruction which he will not want .

He says I 'm pro-America , I have gone Amerikanski , so they no longer trust me . " Of his awn trip to the Soviet Union , Mr. Nixon said he felt , as did Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson Jr. , in Moscow , that it had been " worthwhile from a number of standpoints " but particularly because it afforded " an unprecedented opportunity " for two speeches that gave the Russian people " a true picture of United States foreign policy . " As for the pending trip here by Premier Khrushchev , the Vice President said that the cause of peace " can be " advanced by what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Nixon stressed .
