txt I can not say that all the guests arrived with as much equanimity as did Mr. Eaton , but at least after they had all had a good night 's sleep it was a genial and composed group that sat about the fire in the little Weaving Cabin and discussed organizational details and other plans of what was shortly to become the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild . Among those who attended , in addition to Mrs. Campbell and Mr. Eaton , were President William J. Hutchins of Berea College , Dr. Mary Martin Sloop of the Crossnore School in neighboring Linville Valley , and Clementine Douglas of the Spinning Wheel , Asheville . They were the vanguard of a host of interesting people , some internationally known , particularly in the field of the crafts , who would ascend the steep hill to our school . One who had planned to be present but was unable to attend was Miss Frances Goodrich , a pioneer in the revival of hand-weaving in western North Carolina , of which the Allanstand Cottage Industries in Asheville was a significant result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer to the Guild when it should be formed the facilities of her Allanstand , which was then and continues to be an important outlet for handicraft products . That meeting , with its developing plans for launching the Guild and the offer of Allanstand , was one of our mountain top experiences . And we had held it in our Weaving Cabin . Mr. Eaton was immensely pleased with our log meeting place . He spoke about it often and he prowled about it , poking behind stacks of goods and thumping the sturdy walls with his knuckles . When he wrote his book and told of the meeting , he spoke appreciatively of our cabin . 80 In all the Highlands there seemed no more fitting place for this pioneer meeting than the Weavers ' Cabin on the summit of this mountain ridge , " he wrote , and he gave me permission to quote him . The cabin had been built by the weavers and their husbands , whose homes were scattered about in coves and hollows and on mountainsides within a radius of about twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shipping out products , and discussing problems connected with their work . The significance to those who were gathered within its walls was that in this remote section , far from the sources usually looked to for help in such instances , these neighbors , all poor in money and goods , had through an inspiring experience in co-operation growing out of their handicraft activities built a cabin of native materials with their own hands and equipped it for their use . Tacked to a log in an obscure place on the wall behind one of the looms was a sheet of paper on which was written in that brevity of expression characteristic of mountain people the legend of the cabin . A part of it ran about like this : 3 logs by Henry Willis 1 log by Doc Hoppes 2 days work by Dave Hoyle 2 loads of stone for fireplace by John Maughn 4 logs by Sally Sparks " Some of the logs had been snaked long distances from several mountain homes , and the boards ' for the roof were rived out of white oak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hardware coming from the country around . The labor was , of course , local , and the frame , including the roof , 81 was shaped up and put together in a day by country folk at a House Raisin ' . " So we formed the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild . While it was still young and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway were being developed , we Guild members hoped to interest park officials in helping see to it that only good craft products were shown and sold in these areas . We wanted to prevent the sale of cheap souvenirs often seen along the highways , products in no sense typical of the region . I evolved the idea of seeing the top man in the National Park Service . I felt that if I could just get someone with influence to help me , I would try to get a meeting with the park man . I had a good friend and fellow Episcopalian in Raleigh , Justice Heriot Clarkson of the North Carolina Supreme Court . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I had asked for , so I went to Raleigh , told him what I wanted , and asked him if he would write a letter for me to take to Washington . He wrote the letter , and he did more . He could n't leave his office at the time , but he had someone take me over to the governor 's office . " Take her over to Governor Gardner and ask him to write Miss Lucy a letter too , " he said . The governor read the letter , handed it to his secretary , and said , " Here , take this and write something similar . " Then he told me to return about noon and get it . When Mrs. Bickett and I went back for the letter ? she was the one who had taken me to the governor 's office ? I read it . It really was similar to the one Judge Clarkson had written , for among other things it said , " I have known Lucy Morgan for years . " 82 I showed it to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man before today , " I said . " And this is Saturday and his office has closed until Monday ; I ca n't wait that long to get him to correct it . " " Take it on . Take it on , " she said . I had misgivings , but I took that letter telling something that was not true . And it worried me . There are times , I think , when a little white lie is justifiable , but I simply ca n't get by with telling one . And I felt sure that if I took that letter to Washington , those people up there would find me out . But I took it . And when I got to the offices of the National Park Service I first met Mr. Cammerer , who was then assistant director , and was soon to become director . Not at all what I expected a Washington bureaucrat to be like , he was just as natural and real as someone down under Bailey 's Mountain at Penland . I gave him my letters and hoped he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did . I was terribly afraid he 'd ask me about my long friendship with the governor , but he did n't . He did ask me why I was so interested in the people and the crafts of the mountain region , and I told him I was a mountain girl myself . " I 'm from the sod houses of Nebraska , " he said , and right then he won my heart . Mr. Cammerer remained a friend as long as he lived , and he came to Penland often . He and the other members of the Park Service whom I have met have all been in hearty agreement with the Guild concerning the necessity of requiring that all craft products sold along the Parkway be of high quality , and our relations have been happy and lasting . Mr. Hummel , superintendent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park , and Mr. Sam Weems , superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway , are just as ambi-83 tious as the Guild is to have the best handicraft products of the region shown and sold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the park regions get an authentic picture of the region ? the mode of life of its people and their history and general background ? a few years ago the park officials established near the North Carolina entrance to the great park the Oconoluf tee Pioneer Museum . They brought log buildings from various places within the park area to Oconoluftee and set up a farmstead typical of the pioneer farmsteads of the region . There is the log home , the barn , the smokehouse , the various outbuildings . It is a wonderful museum ; it affords the visitor an opportunity to see almost at a glance how the people in the isolated areas of the mountains lived in the early days . Oconoluftee is the beginning of an outdoor museum comparable to so many interesting ones that have been established in the countries of northern Europe . In order to bring further life and authenticity to this museum , Mr. Hummel and Mr. Arthur Stupka , chief naturalist of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park , asked the Penland School to plan and arrange exhibits in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room . They also asked us to demonstrate carding , spinning and weaving , which we were very happy to do . And it proved to us again ? as we saw with delight the mounting interest of visitors who paused to watch our demonstration ? that to see someone actually creating something is far more interesting than to study that same piece of handicraft after it has been made . We noticed , too , that carding and spinning was particularly intriguing , because comparatively few people of our day have seen this fascinating process in the making of homespun. 84 Mr. Stupka is one of our very favorite people . We met him early through our friendship with Mr. Cammerer , and he comes to Penland every year to give an illustrated talk , using many of the colored films he himself has taken , on that most popular of American national parks . His visit and talk are looked forward to by us Penlanders with keen anticipation . The first year Mr. Stupka came , Rufus was at Penland for a craftsman 's service at our little outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their good-night songs . All through the simple but sincere and impressive little service an evening thrush accompanied Rufus , not only for the singing but also through the sermon . Rufus , the birds , Mr. Stupka , all Penland were so harmonious and apparently so pleased with one another that from that day to this we have planned to have Rufus and Mr. Stupka at the same time , Mr. Stupka 's illustrated talk following Rufus ' annual craftsman 's service at the shrine . Once I asked Mr. Stupka if all Park Service men were choice individuals to begin with or if living close to nature had made them so . He said that they were usually choice men and this prompted them to choose such work , that if they were not the sensitive , appreciative kind they usually soon realized that they did not fit , and withdrew from the service . All the men from the Park Service and the National Forestry Service who come to Penland to give us programs are the kind that make us realize , or at least feel confident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ca n't go to pot with young men like these helping toward the building of a more wholesome tomorrow . 85 NEWS OF WHAT hand-weaving activities at Penland were doing for our neighborhood financially , culturally and socially was beginning to get around among the people of the nation interested in that ancient handicraft . One of those who heard about us was Mr. Edward F. Worst of Chicago . Mr. Worst was the author of the only books on hand-weaving published in this country over a long period and he was perhaps the nation 's authority on the subject . So it was more than fortunate for us that he learned of Penland and in August 1928 came down to spend his vacation with us . It was stupendous , it was manna from heaven , it was a shot in the arm , to weave a mixture of metaphors . No one can say what his coming that summer , and every summer after that until his death in 1949 , really did mean to Penland . As soon as Mr. Worst arrived , he told us he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he could be helpful . Quickly he became interested in what we were doing and from the beginning he found many ways in which to give of himself . And he told us repeatedly that he was having a wonderful vacation doing it . One of my joyful memories of Mr. Worst pictures him with the group of elderly neighbors who belonged to a generation when one spun and wove in order to be clothed . One such wonderful person , a favorite of Mr. Worst as she was with all of us , was Aunt Cumi Woody of the Deyton Bend community . Aunt Cumi happened to be at Penland the first summer Mr. Worst was with us , and she came every year after that as long as she lived . I always got a great satisfaction ? I might describe it as a soaring lift ? seeing Mr. Edward F. Worst of Chicago ? North Shore Drive , Art Institute , Marshall Field , Al Capone , stockyards , political conventions , booming business , roaring traffic ? happily engrossed in the exchange of ideas and techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and full skirt , parted her hair in the middle and combed it sternly into a bun at the back of her neck . It always seemed mighty American and so right to me , this man from the great metropolis in serious though lively confab with this dear old lady of the isolated mountain region in the Southern Highlands , each giving and receiving information about a subject in which they were both tremendously interested . I remember too how sometimes as she sat perched high at one of his multiple-harness looms eagerly working out new methods he had taught her , he would approach her and timidly ask ? for Mr. Worst was inherently shy ? if she would mind taking time off from her loom to go with him and search 87 out some of the plants , herbs , flowers , leaves and roots she used in making her vegetable dyes . It was in this way , on such a jaunt with Aunt Cumi , that we found the rare madder plant . In our copy of A Book of Hand-Woven Coverlets , by Eliza Calvert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's weaving , which had been taken at the Allanstand Cottage Industries in Asheville . Aunt Cumi had not known that pictures of her coverlets and her name were in that book , and one day I told her about it . " Aunt Cumi , " I added , you should have one of these books . " Then I forgot all about it . But the next year when Aunt Cumi came she went to my desk , picked up A Book o f Hand-Woven Coverlets and asked , Is this mine ? " Puzzled , I said " No-o . " She said , " You said something about getting one printed for me . " So I wrote the publishers and told them about it , and ordered a copy . I really thought that they should send her a complimentary copy , but they did n't . They sent me a bill for it . Anyway , it was worth it to me . Some time ago I saw one of Aunt Cumi 's coverlets on display in the Pioneer Museum at Oconoluftee . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic furnishings and farm equipment , nothing could have been more authentic than Aunt Cumi 's beautiful coverlet . She wove it herself in a pattern called Saint Anne 's Robe . But she not only did the weaving . She sheared the sheep , carded and spun her yarn , dyed it with vegetable dyes from plants and roots she had found , and wove it in that beautifully intricate design . The predominating color of this coverlet is brown , and Aunt Cumi obtained the dye by boiling the hulls of black walnuts . Its secondary color is blue , made from wild indigo . 88 Indigo is the most temperamental dye I know . It is compounded of wild indigo , wheat bran , lye made from wood ash , and madder . To make it , one borrows , if possible , a starter from some neighbor , just as one does for buckwheat pancakes . If it is n't possible to borrow a starter , then one sets her own bluepot . The pot is usually kept at the back of the stove or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends in general on the " notions " of the blue pot . When it is bubbly on top and smells up the whole house , then the dyer tries it out by dipping in a skein of yarn . If this test reveals that the pot has " come , " then one dyes simply by turning the skeins of yarn round and round in the dye bath until they are the desired color of blue . If a light blue is wanted , little of the dye is required ; if a darker blue , then more time in the bath and more stirring of the skeins are necessary . The thing to remember about this dye is that it is not boiled ; boiling would upset the equilibrium , and the dye would be spoiled . This type of dye is effective only until it " gets tired , " as the mountain dyers describe the chemical reaction that goes on in the pot . Then it must " rest " until it " comes " again . Like our mountain weavers , bluepot dye has temperament and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its own time and way . Aunt Cumi 's beautiful coverlet also has a little green , and this she got by first dyeing the yarn yellow in the ooze of hickory bark , then dipping the yellow yarn into the bluepot . And she achieved a rose color by dyeing the yarn in the ooze made of the delicate little madder plant which she found in damp meadow places . Much of the charm of the hand-woven mountain fabrics is attributable to the quality of the dye the mountain weavers 89 concoct from their native plants , including flowers , leaves , stems , roots , bark , nuts . It was the beauty of the coloring , as well as the excellence of the weaving , that had so intrigued Mabel Fauble and me that day we first laid eyes on Aunt Susan Phillips ' fabulous coverlets , skirts and basques . The most experienced dyer in our community was Mrs. Emma Conley , the beloved lady into whose custard pie the one-year-old stepped that memorable day of the Weaving Cabin log-raising . I suspect there 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plants useful in the dyeing of homespuns and of the processes employed to use them most effectively . One of the most popular little books sold in our gift shop is Mrs. Conley 's small volume of instructions on how to use the various mountain plants and their fruits to obtain vegetable dyes . That it came from the printer titled Vegetable Dying has made it almost a collector 's item . In fact , dropping the e in dyeing , either written or spoken , is n't as likely to cause a commotion on our campus as it probably would in other places . For instance , often someone at Penland will yell out , " Where 's Mrs. Lewis ? " and somebody else will answer with utter equanimity , " She 's dyeing this afternoon . " Or someone may want to know why So-and-so is n't on hand for lunch or dinner and he 'll get the calm explanation , " She dyed this morning and it put her a little late . " It must be somewhat disconcerting to persons visiting us for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these up-anddown acres at Penland , but there 's also been a lot of dyeing . Mrs. Conley dedicated her little book to Mrs. Meta Lewis , " who has been so kind in helping me in the Dye House for the last three years , and who helped get these directions ready for printing , " she explains . " As a little girl my mother taught me to card , spin and dye the wool for our clothes , " she says in the 90 Introduction . " The dyes we got from the plants growing in our neighborhood . We used both the iron and the brass kettles and did our work out-of-doors . The colors and formulas in this pamphlet came from those early experiences and are the ones I have taught at Penland . I hope they will benefit all who are interested in this craft . " Mrs. Lewis likes to tell about the new student who came to the Dye House one day while she and Mrs. Conley were cooking a batch of onion skins . " Hmm-m-m , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We 're going to dye with them after a while . " " Oh , " she said , you have to cook ' em first ? " " Yes , you have to cook ' em first , " Mrs. Lewis said . She went out , but in a little while she was back . " Where are the onions ? " she asked . " What did you do with them ? " Mrs. Conley looked up and with a perfectly straight face answered , We sent ' em over to the kitchen for soup . " You use only the outer skin of the onion , the deep-brown thin skin . It makes a beautiful gold color . To dye a pound of wool , Mrs. Conley explains in her book , you use a pound of onion skins ? quite a quantity , considering how light they are ? and an ounce and a half of alum . Here is her method : " Put the skins in a brass kettle , cover with water and boil one hour . Strain and return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a generous dye bath . Now add the alum , stirring until thoroughly dissolved . Then add the wool and let it simmer thirty minutes . Remove the wool from the dye bath , rinse in warm water until the water is clear . Hang the wool in the sun to dry . " As soon as you put your onion skins on to boil , wash your 91 wool in a good soap suds , rinse thoroughly and allow the wool to remain in water until ready to use . " The color you get will be shades of yellow . From rhododendron leaves you get a beautiful gray with a brownish cast that is very unusual ; I 've never seen another color just like it . It 's best to soak the leaves overnight before you begin . You use an iron kettle for rhododendron leaves , and they should be boiled two hours . Then strain and return the ooze to the same kettle and add enough water to make a generous dye bath . Next add copperas , which is a mordant or setting agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool and allow the mixture to simmer thirty minutes . Then take your wool out , rinse until the water is clear , then hang the wool in the sun to dry . As long as there is dye in the water , you can add successive skeins of wool . Each time , however , the wool takes up a certain amount of the dye , so that each batch is lighter as it comes out . From the wild coreopsis you get a beautiful color that may range from burnt orange to dark red . It 's hardly red , either ; it 's more of a rust , I 'd say , and if you keep adding successive batches of wool , the color gets lighter and lighter until it is a pale rose or coral pink . So actually you can never entirely match colors . Each batch is unique . Each has its slightly individual color no matter how hard you work to make one batch like another . That 's why we usually dye several pounds of wool at a time , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But commercial dyes do not completely match either . I was telling about using onion skins to procure yellow dyes . Broom sedge also gives a beautiful yellow ? just plain old broom sedge grass . You put it all into the brass kettle , stalks 92 and everything , and you use alum as mordant . The first dyeing is a strong yellow , and each batch takes some of the color out , so that the yellow gets lighter and lighter as more wool is put in . Back in the old days it was sometimes difficult for the isolated mountain folk to get the necessary mordants , and occasionally , when they had no copperas or alum , they would use sumac leaves . These contain tannic acid , which serves as a mordant . Smartweed gives a beautiful chartreuse . It grows out in the garden , has a little long flower with tiny red things on the stem . You put flower , stem , root , everything into your brass kettle and boil it . Marigold blossoms make a deep yellow dye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-dozen black-walnut hulls in with the marigolds ; the color will be about that of beech tree leaves in the fall . Pokeberries make a red dye . It takes about half a bushel of berries for each pound of wool . Students often ask us how we get a green dye . There is nothing we know about that makes green . We have to mix indigo , or blue , with yellow . Of course , blue and yellow , as any painter knows , makes green . One day Mr. Owl , who lives at the Cherokee Indian reservation , was visiting us , and we discussed methods of dyeing . In fact , we were working in the Dye House that day . Mr. Owl is an educated man ; he has two college degrees , one from Carlisle and the other from , I believe , Oklahoma University . He is greatly interested in preserving the history and traditions of the Indians in our state . During our conversation he asked me about green , and I said that we had been unable to get green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " In the early days , Miss Lucy , the Cherokees did get a green , but nobody knows now what they got it from , " he revealed . " Though we have experimented a great deal , we have never recovered the secret . " Walnut hulls make a beautiful brown , and butternut hulls ? they call it the white walnut up here ? make a medium brown . Sassafras makes a soft yellow-tan , goldenrod blossoms make yellow , acorns provide a tan if you use alum as a mordant and a darker grayish-tan if you use copperas . Doghobble , which is our Penland name for leucothea , gives a very dark brown with a greenish cast ; cocklebur , using everything about the plant except the roots , provides a satisfactory chartreuse ; pecan hulls make a tan ; apple bark gives a dark yellowtan if you use alum and a distinctly brass color if you use chrome as mordant . But I believe my favorite color is procured from the little madder plant . It makes a red color , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as there is color in the dye bath . Madder is a weed , a little plant that grows in meadows and damp places . Its color is more of a rose , I suppose , though we can get it in a really deep red , too . It is a pleasure to experiment with madder ; you get an amazing range of tints and shades . We do n't go in for dyeing with clay at Penland , although Aunt Manda Bailey told me that she used to get clay around here somewhere and use it for dyeing . But we have tried out any number of plants ? tree bark , nuts , berries , flowers , roots , stems , grasses , burs , hulls ? and we have made some interesting discoveries . We have found that the sort of pot or kettle you use is of 94 considerable importance . We have three pots , iron , brass and copper , and we long ago learned that the pot you boil a plant in makes all the difference in the world in the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyes you do in the iron pot and the lightest colors in the brass . The metal actually affects the color . We have discovered , for example , that sumac leaves or blossoms boiled in an iron kettle will make a dark gray dye . But boiled in the brass kettle , the color comes out a tan . And here 's something even more intriguing , I think : For some of the dyes , the kind of day you have when you are preparing the dye bath makes a material difference in the results obtained . For example , madder should always be dyed on a sunny day . As soon as the dyed wool is rinsed , we hang it out in the sunshine to dry . It must be the action of the temperature that brings out the colors . Maybe it 's comparable to the coloring of the leaves in the fall . Scientists claim to have exploded the theory that it is frost that produces gorgeously colored fall leaves . They say that the colored leaves are a result of the extremes of temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold night ? it does n't have to be freezing ? and a hot midday , the spread in temperature will assure gorgeous fall leaves . There 's much to learn about dyeing homespuns with dyes procured from our native plants . It 's a fascinating subject , one about which we 'll never know all the answers . And like working in handicrafts in general , you learn by doing . That , I think , is the way we grow . 95 THAT FIRST YEAR MY . Worst came to Penland ? in August 1928 ? he was with us three days . He spent them busily , visiting with the neighboring weavers , showing us the products of his own hands and looms , tying up and adjusting the multiple-harness loom he had given us , and inspiring us generally . When Mr. Paul Bernat , publisher of The Handicrafter , learned that Mr. Worst was coming to Penland , he came down to observe him in action , and the next issue of his magazine carried an article about Mr. Worst 's visit to our school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country asking if Mr. Worst planned to come again and , if so , might the writers join us during the time he would be here ? We replied that we were sorry that could not be . We explained that Mr. Worst had come to Penland because of his 96 interest in what we were doing with weaving in our mountain community . He had charged us nothing , we revealed further , and we thought it would hardly be fair to him to have people waiting on our doorstep to be taught by him when he was actually coming to Penland on his vacation . When we told Mr. Worst about the letters , however , he said : " Let anybody come who wants to . " Mr. Bernat came every year as long as The Handicrafter was published , and he wrote more articles about Mr. Worst and Penland . After the article in 1929 there were again eager requests , and so we accepted the applications of seven women . We quoted them the exorbitant rate of a dollar a day for room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we thought we should charge only what it actually cost us to feed and house the group . It was in August 1929 then , that I consider the Penland School of Handicrafts was born . That was the year we had our first outside students . All our activities were still carried on in Morgan Hall , the building that had served Rufus as the rectory . It did have six bedrooms that provided accommodations for officials such as Mr. and Mrs. Worst and members of their family , the bishop when he came for a visit , the lady who snored too loudly to be put with the group , and so forth . The rest of us were to sleep on the upstairs porch in the twelve cots that had been made of cot parts discarded by the Appalachian School and stored in the basement . Some of the heads did not match the feet , and sometimes neither head nor foot matched the body , but my brother Ralph and Mr. Wyatt wired the parts together securely so that they served satisfactorily . As letters began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . One mother wrote that she would have to bring her three daughters , but she would solve that situation very easily by taking a small apartment in Penland , she explained . One applicant asked for a private bath , and when I wrote that we had no private baths she replied : It is very necessary that I have a bath . " How was I to answer that ? Bonnie , Tony and I cogitated upon the matter , and Tony came up with the answer : " Write her to take it before she leaves home ! " Before these people arrived in Penland I got out all their letters and tried to read between the lines . I thought I 'd try to give the best cots to the fussiest people and the worst ones to those with good dispositions . That would certainly not be a fair way of assigning cots , my conscience told me . But I did n't have to wrestle with it long , because when they came we found to our joy that they all had good dispositions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we went through to get to the sleeping porch . The first morning I sensed that the folk were feeling that they had no privacy . They had n't said anything , but I definitely got that feeling . So quickly , at breakfast before they had time to begin complaining , I stood up and said : If anybody feels she would like more privacy , she can take a piece of chalk , mark a circle around herself and say , Please do not look beyond this . ' Her wishes will be respected . " After that everybody felt relaxed and at ease , and I never again had the feeling that people were uncomfortable . The following summer we had sixteen people attending what we called our " institute , " and each year after that the numbers attending doubled those of the previous year as long as our facilities made this possible . Rooms were rented at the 98 Appalachian School , and the old farmhouse I had bought was made livable , although there was no running water there except for a faucet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for looms , the school allowed us to use the lower porch of old Ridgeway , its academic building , which was 101 feet long and roomy enough . But the trouble with that porch was that the school was conducting a summer camp for young children and on rainy days they used the upper porch for roller-skating . Fancy learning how to weave with roller-skating going on over your head . But this may have been a blessing in disguise , after all . That was the year the students decided that , if they wished to continue coming to Penland , it seemed to be up to them to provide a place where instruction could be given without too much interference . So they began to inquire about costs . How much , they wanted to know , would it cost to build a log cabin to be used for just that purpose ? We consulted our neighbors , Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Ellis , who said that a log , if bought and delivered on the grounds , would cost about $2.50 . Every student gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day had dawned . One of my friends wrote that Mr. Beeson , an architect in Johnson City , had heard of the way our new weaving cabin was being made possible , and would like to contribute his services in drawing the plans . Of course we thanked him , and gladly accepted his generous offer . When Mr. Beeson came to discuss the house and what it was planned to be used for , he suggested that we build it large enough to take care of our needs for many years ahead . Consequently , the more we planned , the larger that house on paper grew . We foresaw a dining room and kitchen , sleeping quarters 99 and plenty of space for instruction . When it finally reached the blue-print stage , it was no longer a log cabin but the mansion in the sky that I had dreamed of for years . It would be eighty feet long and fifty feet wide and , since it would be constructed on the side of a hill , it would have a daylight basement on the lower side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and kitchen , two large rooms for looms , an office , a washroom and a recreation room . On the second floor would be sleeping quarters . Very quickly we learned that building this mansion , as we considered it already , would be quite different from putting up a little log cabin . For one thing , this building would require a large and substantial basement . To advise us on this project we called in three angels : Mr. B. C. Burgess , our constant friend and business adviser ; Mr. Herbert Duncan of the Spruce Pine Lumber Company ; and an expert in log construction , who was actually an Angel , Mr. Merrit Angel . The immediate problem was how to get the basement finished in time for a log-raising the next spring . We had no money , and so we concluded that we would wait until spring before starting the work so that the bills would n't be too old by the time the students began arriving with ? we devoutly hoped ? enough money to help materially . But Mr. Duncan warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and good weather , and he said we would never be ready for a spring log-raising if we did n't start work that fall . But how could we do this without money ? Mr. Duncan made it all sound easy enough . He told us his company would let us have whatever we needed , and we could pay for it whenever we were able . When I demurred , telling 100 him we could not pay for anything until summer , and that it would take two or even three summers to pay for that basement , he still insisted that we get on with the work . He declared that payments were no matter of concern with him . Well , he made the thing sound so promising that we decided to do as he had suggested . But then the thought occurred to us : What of the labor that had to eat to live , and what of materials that we could not get from Mr. Duncan and would most likely have to come from outside the county ? I went to the bank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money they would let me have . I had offered to put up the eight acres of land and the old farmhouse on it , which I owned , but the finance folk told me that the property was worth little as collateral , and so I had had to use my life insurance policies . That was a scary time . I felt that I was skating on very thin ice . Everything we owned was at stake . What we had was a stack of donated logs and a faith that in the dark was shaky but before the public had to seem strong and bold or we were lost . We had started with plans for a small log cabin and in almost no time were in the midst of a program to build a tremendous , expensive building . But if my friends were demonstrating their faith , should n't I show faith too ? What could we do but go ahead ? So Mr. Angel got his crew of workmen together and they went to work . That was long before the day of bulldozers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wheelbarrow , or pan and mule team . But the men and mules worked , and by springtime the basement walls and foundation were finished , the subflooring was down , and all was ready for the logs to be put in place . 101 The next thing was to raise the logs . We remembered that beautiful and happy day when we had raised the logs for the Weaving Cabin , that May fifth with the apple orchards in bloom . So we set this log-raising for the fifth of May and hoped again for apple blossoms . It was an early spring that year and apprehensively we watched the apple trees bloom before their usual time , and we saw the blooms shattered and blown away before our great day arrived . We wished that we could spray those blooms with glue to hold them on the trees a little longer , but we could do nothing but watch them go , and sigh resignedly . But just then , in time for the arrival of our guests and in time for the log-raising , the wild crabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrance which is , I think , the most allpervading and heavenly fragrance there is . Of course , I think the same thing of the wild honeysuckle when it is in bloom . So after all , nature was most co-operative . Besides the wild crabs blooming all over the hilltops , the woods , paths and fields abounded with the dainty little wild iris ; lush , long-stemmed blue violets , here and there white or yellow ones , peeped modestly forth ; everywhere were the white spikes of the mountain galax , and all the tender greens of returning spring . We asked our new bishop , Bishop Gribbin , to plan a special service with which we might begin the day , and we marveled at how aptly he found passages in the Bible perfectly fitted for a log-raising day . Although we had thought tentatively of having this service at sunrise , we finally decided that the day would be full enough without so early a start , and we had it at eight o'clock , just after breakfast , on the subflooring of what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new clergyman and the future director of the Appa-102 lachian School , brought a little portable organ and played the hymns . Neighbors , workmen and guests gathered for the impressive little service . When it was finished , the work of the day began . The four notchers took their places , one at each corner of the building . Neighbors hitched their teams to " swingle " trees or doubletrees and snaked the logs to the places from which other men with cant hooks would roll and heave them into position . Notchers measured and notched , mules strained and pulled , men with axes and saws worked and sweated . It was a busy time . Meanwhile at the old Pines a quilt was in a frame , and any of the women who tired of the log-raising activities took up their thimbles and needles and put in a few stitches on what would be a gift for the next community bride . But at noon all these activities ceased . The mules were fed and watered ; and the men , women , children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was spread out such a dinner as only a rural community can provide . For miles around the women had come in with hams baked to a delicious tenderness , fried chicken , sausages , vegetables of every sort , jellies , jams , pies , pickles and cakes , all of sufficient appeal to make today 's vainest women , were they to fasten their eyes upon such food , cheerfully abandon , at least for that meal , their dieting schedules . And after the busy morning in the open air , certainly no food ever tasted better . When everybody had had his fill and after we had talked about what an important role the new Craft House would play in the life of the community , the men , the mules , the axes and saws and cant hooks all went back to work . By nightfall the four walls of the Edward F. Worst 103 Craft House were standing , waiting for their roof . Through the summer the work on the building continued ; the day before Mr. Worst returned in August the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion when the returning students saw the new structure and each conjectured which log in the wall was his , and everybody marveled at the miracles wrought through concerted and joyful effort . We had profited by adding a much-needed building to our plant , but we had profited even more in having worked together as a community in attaining the answer to our need . And we had enjoyed doing it . That summer the Craft House was used thoroughly and effectively . To be sure , it had an unfinished basement , walls with no chinking , a subflooring of green lumber that in drying left cracks wider by the day and knots that dropped out . But it was a happy house . " Let 's never put chinking between the logs , " students would say , " because the way it is now we can sit anywhere in the building and enjoy the views in every direction . " The knots and wide cracks in the subflooring , however , were at times disturbing , because bobbins , reed hooks , shuttles and other small treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such items had been lost through the floor to threaten the crippling of weaving activities , some brave soul would venture below and return as popular as an old-time peddler with a pack on his back . Two black snakes lived in the basement , but we did not disturb them . They were as good as cats at keeping the mice away , and I have always understood that black snakes keep away the venomous kind . Nor did students who slept in the 104 Craft House that summer fear our pet snakes , even though the snakes could easily have entered their rooms through doorways , between the logs or through the knotholes . To create rooms in the house , in fact , the students hung up blankets and coverlets or fashioned walls out of scraps of building paper left over , or of cement tow sacks . And they saw no need of having doors ; doors might shut out something interesting . Nor was there any lack of social events . It may have been the perpetual Turnbulls , as we called them , who started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dormitory or it may have been that Wild Irish Rose Baldwin ; at any rate , the first tea service was nicked cups discarded from the kitchen , with the wrong end of a toothbrush used for stirring sugar , or a spoon brought from home . Eventually , though it was after the passage of a few years , the perpetual Turnbulls perpetuated the tea habit by donating a tea set of real cups , saucers and plates . People that summer , not to be outdone by the log-givers of the year before , gave windows . And it happened that a window sash cost the same as a log , two dollars and a half . Everybody gave at least one window sash ; some gave whole windows , some gave doors , and two students from St. Louis , Lucy Elliott and Lonnie Baird , gave the fireplace and chimney . Our mansion in the sky was rapidly becoming earthbound , solid , substantial . And it was an inspiration , a challenge . No playhouse built by a group of children anywhere could have created more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students and teachers had created this combined recreation hall , social center , workshop . So by the time the students and staff began returning the next summer , we had windows and doors in and some of the 105 bedrooms furnished . And before that summer was over , other people expressed their eagerness to give bedrooms , so many , in fact , that there were more people wanting to give than there were bedrooms . Interest was contagious , growing , glowing , satisfying . That summer before the students began returning , I recall , as I would walk through the building , planning and trying to get ready for the summer 's activities , I seemed to get the feeling that the walls themselves reflected the love and the joy that had gone into the creating of that house . Bonnie Ford once said that Penland was a composite of all the friends that throughout the years have come to be a part of it . It may be my imagination or it may be something even more ephemeral , but to me it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and joy and togetherness that have gone into its building , and whether or not newcomers are conscious of it , I feel quite sure that they are affected by it . I am at a loss to express just what I feel . But an early student at Penland , Edna Kleinmeyer of Lakewood , Ohio , wrote me a letter in which she told of the part played by nature in giving depth and strength to the meaning I seek to express . Edna said I might quote from it : " Figuratively , as well as literally , it has been a mountaintop experience , " she said of her time at Penland . " Not knowing the Penland tradition , I had expected to find only a school where one might learn a skill ; I did not dream that it was the expression of a way of life . The distinctive spirit of the place . . . was a subtle thing , found in the fragrance of unvarnished wood in the morning dampness ; at Bailey 's Peak swathed in mists or printed blue-gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the looms . It was in 106 Auntie Freas ' cheery good humor and in Mr. Peters ' twinkle and unruffled patience ; in the plaintive music of the shepherd 's pipes ; in the voices singing Auld Lang Syne ' softly in front of the glowing embers of the great stone fireplace while Mr. Worst examined the lovely St. Francis he had just received ; in Mr. Worst 's serenity of voice , and his fine tact , kindliness and respect for the dignity of men and women ; in Mrs. Conley , motherly and competent , carding wool or stirring yarns in the steaming iron pot in the dye shed ; in Professor Lear 's barbed jests deflating little sham balloons ; in the glitter of mica in red clay roads ; in Mrs. McElwain 's brook laving forget-me-nots and peppermint ; in velvety , myriadcolored moths fluttering into the dormitory out of the darkness where the whip-poor-will called and the moon rose over the corn ; in Mrs. Ellis ladling out cider in the fresh coolness of her spring house ; in a woman in the fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an iron kettle over an outdoor fire .... I 've never known a place where one experiences such a feeling of liberation , of taking for granted that mistakes are a normal part of the learning process ; of tolerant acceptance of people as they are , yet faith in their desire and ability to grow .... " 107 BY THE SECOND summer the windows and doors and the chimney and fireplace had been built in the Craft House , so that life assumed a degree of graciousness . The huge fireplace itself , I thought , made the difference between a house and a home , for what is a home without a fireplace ? And this fireplace , I felt , was a very special one , for our friend and neighbor Bascom Hoyle built it with the utmost feeling . For the chimney he chose stones with moss , to be laid where they would be enjoyed from the terrace . And for the hearth he had searched Mr. Henry Willis ' place until he found one huge flat stone three feet by nine feet ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soapstone which Doc Hoppes gave us from his quarry . But that year the most outstanding , conspicuous , pressing need in the Craft House was for bathrooms . We had a bath-108 room , of course . With the exception of a few bedrooms , there were no finished rooms in the entire three-story , fifty-byeighty-foot building ; there was only the studding to show where the partitions would be . But at the corner of the second floor , just at the head of the stairs , we tacked up building paper around the studding to enclose the solitary lavatory and toilet . Thus we had a bathroom . And this bathroom was supposed to provide for the needs of the large and growing family on the three floors of that big craft building . People who have never lived in a house with a paper bathroom just do n't know what they have missed , for I have never known a more entertaining room . For example , when the school opened that summer , carpenters were still working on the house ; as they would carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner where the bathroom was , and in doing so they were likely to rub themselves or the lumber against that paper and maybe even punch a hole in it . And right there is where I discovered an interesting phenomenon . If there was a man in that bathroom when this occurred , nothing whatsoever would happen . But just let a woman be in there when the carpenter lumbered against the paper wall , or worse , when he stuck the end of his timber through the building paper ! In that very instant he would be assailed by squeals , ejaculations , vituperations ! Some people were even saying that modesty no longer existed , at Penland , I mean . But it made stories to tell , and after the worst was over , I 'm confident that even the principal characters in some of these situations enjoyed their roles . So the students who came that year agreed that the greatest contribution they could make to Penland ? and themselves while they were here ? would be to provide additional bath-109 rooms . The gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of two dollars and a half , the cost of one log , and although no one could think of any piece of plumbing that would cost as little as two-fifty , there was much joking about it , and planning and giving too . But we were hardly ready to accept with equanimity the good fortune that came to us one evening ? it was while that same group was with us ? when an interesting-looking foreign car drove up the hill ? the first foreign car ever to have been driven up our hill as far as I had seen or heard about . We were still living in Morgan Hall , and as we watched the car being driven around the house to the front , we were all consumed with interest and downright curiosity . A gentleman and two ladies alighted and I went out to greet them and make them at home . " We are about to sit down to supper , " I said . " Wo n't you join us ? " They said they would be glad to , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Craft House , for that is where we took all our guests , since it was really the showplace of the county . We showed them over the house and I happened to have the gentleman along with me . With much pride I showed him the prize room of the house , which was the little paper-partitioned bathroom . But he seemed rather bored . I thought that the poor man simply had no sense of humor , and I shrugged off his lack of appreciation of our bathroom . After we had looked over the house , we gathered around the big fireplace as we customarily did , and chatted . In our group was Professor Lear of the electrical engineering department of the University of North Carolina , who came every summer as long as he lived , who liked Penland so well , in fact , that he built a home and retired here . 110 The first chance " Pop " Lear had to get my ear he said , " Do you know who that man is ? " " He told me his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all I know about him . " " Yes , he 's Mr. Crane , all right , " said Pop , a wry grin on his face . " The Mr. Crane ? one of the Cranes of the Crane Plumbing Company . " " The Lord sent him up this hill , " I said , and I meant it . I was glad I had n't known who he was when I showed him the bathroom , because I would have felt very self-conscious . But I was happy that he had seen it . Afterward I asked Mr. Crane how he had heard about Penland , and he revealed that he had been to the White Top Folk Festival and someone ? he did not remember who ? told him not to go home until he had been to Penland . So he had come over . Well , it happened . After he returned home his company sent us fixtures for three bathrooms . Soon after these had arrived I received a letter from Professor Lear , now back at Chapel Hill . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write , he said , to tell them what Crane had done ; he would not ask for anything . Then we would just wait and see what happened . The professor well knew that it was against my principles to ask for money for the Craft House . I regarded it as my firstborn child , and one does not beg for one 's children if there is any other way to manage . According to my sister , I wo n't beg for it but I do n't mind exposing its needs . Clearly , Professor Lear 's suggestion involved only " exposing its needs . " I gave permission . Dr. Lear wrote to both Standard Manufacturing Company and to Kohler of Kohler , Wisconsin . And they replied that 111 they would be happy to furnish the plumbing for the entire building ! When the fixtures arrived that winter we displayed them on the stage of the Spruce Pine Room , where they were admired and discussed by us , of course , but also by all our many visitors . By summer , all had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom a copper plate , etched in our own metal shop with the words : " Plumbing given by Crane " or " by Standard " or " from Kohler of Kohler . " But having a school grow up around us involved more than building buildings and begging plumbing . We would soon have to have water , and , of course , we required a septic tank . The first water supply was comparatively simple and inexpensive , because our good friend Tim Wyatt had been digging ditches and laying pipes down from springs up on Art'urs ' Knob , and we had been getting our water by gravity . Then , too , there was an old abandoned well near the Craft House , and temporarily ? until we could get some money and ascertain how to arrange a better disposal system ? we dumped the sewage into it . Generous and far-seeing Pop Lear , wise in the ways of the world and more particularly of state boards of health , knew that there would have to be a more dignified sewage-disposal system . So from Chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor at the University , and the two sat around our living-dining room table by the hour , making plans , studying specifications and writing letters . They sent for blueprints , got the state board of health to send experts to advise , got special permission to act as planners and supervisors , and they and Mr. Wyatt went to work . It literally required weeks to do the job . Difficulties were met and discussed , dispositions wore threadbare , vocabularies were taxed . When a teacher or pupil , seeing Pop and Mr. 112 Wyatt sitting on a log in heated argument , would draw near to see if all the tales they had heard could be true , they retreated hastily and in pale wonderment that the half had not been told ! But looking back a moment later they might discover Mr. Wyatt lending a helping hand to exhausted Dr. Lear . And the two would take up their picks and start digging again . That septic tank and draining field must have been scientifically designed and built , for now that Mitchell County has graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , with a supervisor who inspects us regularly , we consistently display proudly a Grade-A rating for sanitation . But as more and more students came to enroll at Penland , more and more water was used . Mr. Wyatt played around up on Art'ur 's Knob , coaxed all the little trickling springs into a central pool and with concrete was able to form a reservoir of sorts . But in order to make use of all the springs he could bring together , Mr. Wyatt had to spread out his reservoir so much that he could not put a cover over it , and without a cover it did not meet state requirements . And there was n't enough water anyway , even with that reservoir , for our ever-growing summer family . And to make bad matters considerable worse , the following summer was extremely dry . What a summer we had ! There were days and even weeks when no tub baths were possible . There was one day when there was no water , and we had to haul in some from a neighbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them that enough water would be brought in for face-washing and tooth-brushing , but for other needs each person would have to go to the woods . It was primitive ! Why that group of students stayed I do n't know , but nobody gave up . Perhaps it was the challenge of the situation . I spent days and nights 113 of wondering , scheming , praying for rain , and debating with myself whether or not to close the school , until one night I knew within my soul that if there was no rain within the remaining days of that particular three-week term , the school would have to be closed . And then , the decision made , the rains came ! But I knew that we were at the end of our improvising for water . Before summer came again we would have to have a well drilled . Soon we began to receive gifts earmarked for a water supply for the school , and when we had received enough to dare negotiate with well-drillers , we sought prices . Once more that mystical two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost two dollars and fifty cents a foot for welldrilling . And cash when the job was completed . There could be no waiting ; it would n't be like our dealing with the Spruce Pine Lumber Company , or any of the other business concerns in the county who had been so patient with us . I took a chance ; I told the men to start drilling . The depth of the well would determine whether we had enough money to pay for it . And they kept going down . It seemed to me that as that drilling machine banged deeper and deeper into the earth it was saying with every drop of the hammer , " two dollars and a half , two dollars and a half , two dollars and a half . " Water was finally reached in sufficient quantity at a depth of 315 feet . And 315 times two dollars and a half was a lot of money , considerably more than all our gifts for the well had amounted to . But by robbing every account we had , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found the money and the men were paid ? and blessing of all blessings , the water flowed ! The Edward F. Worst Craft House still lacked a great deal . 114 Having to turn our best energies to getting water , of course , delayed the job of finishing work elsewhere . But it was taking shape , surely if not very rapidly , as various individuals and groups were inspired to give entire rooms on the main floor . The largest of these was the recreation room , with ample space for folk dancing and a stage for use in the presenting of plays . This room was given by the civic organizations of Spruce Pine , which were in the main made up of men representing companies who were " carrying " us . That , I thought , was all the more indicative of the generosity and good will of these businessmen who did and continue to do so much for our school . On the wall of that room a small copper plate says " Spruce Pine Room " and by that name the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's auxiliary of an Episcopal church in Pittsburgh that had sold our community products over a period of many years . Now the library and exhibit room , it has a copper plate reading : " Pittsburgh Room , Woman 's Auxiliary , Diocese of Pittsburgh . " Perhaps the most conspicuous room in the house , however , is the one entered from the east terrace , which might well be called the front room . In the early years this large hall was used for looms , but later became the lounge , given by former students of Mr. Worst and called the " Chicago Room . " Even before it was finished , the Worsts began to use their hangings , coverlets , draperies and such on the walls , giving it a very gracious and welcoming appearance . Throughout the years this handsome room has received much attention from various friends who have woven for it curtains in lengthwise stripes of woods green , blue , red , a little yellow and a little black , and " settin ' " cushions of a matching green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have chosen with loving care appropriate chairs , a writing desk , 115 coffee tables and other furnishings . We consider the Chicago Room one of the most gracious on our campus . The second-floor dormitory occupies almost half of the floor and the students one summer combined to pay for the finishing of it . Strolling through the room one day , one of our Penland boys , Ralph Conley , noticed signs reading " Ohio " or " New York " or perhaps " Michigan . " The signs meant that students from these various states were responsible for certain projects . Ralph was depressed by the fact that nowhere had he seen even a small sign referring to Penland . He came to me , considerably disturbed , and told me about it . " Miss Lucy , " he said , " that 's bad . And I 'm going to do something to remedy the situation . " So he began to collect money from Penland neighbors , and this little community , which is n't even a village , contributed enough to finance the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of growth Mr. Worst brought down during their spring vacation a group of his nephews and several other Chicago teachers to put up sheet rock for the walls of the second and third floors . It was a satisfying and exhilarating experience to watch that group of earnest young men going to work with saws and hammers , and it was amazing how quickly they performed that task of loving service . The architect originally had not planned a third floor for the building , but when we found how much room there was in the attic , we asked Mr. Beeson to come back and alter his plans to provide the third floor . He did ; he added dormer windows , and we had another floor for sleeping quarters ! While Mr. Beeson planned the dormer windows , Tony Ford designed closets , cupboards and drawers to be built into the eaves , so that the spaces between the dormers were utilized . When the work was done , the third floor became one of the 116 most popular residences , especially for the younger crowd . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had built two bathrooms , but only one of them had a bathtub ! The rest of the fixtures were in , but as it was continually doing at Penland , the money had run out with one bathtub short . There were seventeen beds up there and they were full . So those third-floorers decided they needed that second bathtub , just had to have it . But how ? They decided to raise money with which to purchase one . And after much thought and planning they agreed that for one of the money-raising schemes they would sell tickets at a quarter apiece for the first bath ; they would draw the winning ticket from those sold . But if you bought a ticket and did n't win the first bath , it was also agreed , you would be entitled to watch the winner take the first bath . So the tickets sold quite well . Then they had auctions . If you went upstairs you could n't get down again without buying something . I remember one of the girls had to pay thirty-five cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs . And they polished shoes and did all sorts of other things to raise money for that bathtub . One day they reported to me , beaming , " Miss Lucy , we 've got the money for the tub ! " The tub was duly purchased and quickly installed . Then they held the drawing for the first bath . And would you know , the best-looking girl won it ! She was tall , had beautiful red hail ' , and was just a beautiful girl every way . So the night came for the bath , and there was great excitement . Everybody gathered upstairs to see the performance . The press was there , and the photographers were there with their cameras ready , and everything was lined up to see this 117 good-looking girl take the first bath in the new tub . The third floor was crowded and everybody was trying to push into the bathroom to get a peep as she got into the bathtub . And so , when the assemblage is all set and everybody is ready for the performance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shower cap and a raincoat , and as far as anybody can see , nothing else . She stands beside the tub , and it is announced that she is now ready to strip off the raincoat and step into the tub . And the proverbial eyes are proverbially glued . Well , she took off the raincoat , and of course she had on a bathing suit , though it was a rather scant one . And the first bath in the new tub began . The photographers aimed their cameras and flash bulbs popped , and the girl promptly disappeared , except for head and shoulders , into a bubble bath that would have made even Hollywood envious . So the evening ended hilariously , and we had bought and paid for our new bathtub . Once more it had been shown that the ingenuity of our Penland folk is immeasurable , boundless , unpredictable . Another time on the third floor of the Craft House we had a circus , a carnival . On that floor Tony had built cubbies , as I said , one cubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shoes and to hang clothes , and a little dressing table . Well , we used those cubbies for our carnival . One was a fortune-telling booth , one sold cookies and cakes and candies , another one had a grab bag in it , another had a bingo game going ? each cubby had something to raise money . One bathroom was a chamber of horrors . I do n't know what they were doing in there ? I never went in ? but everybody came out screaming . 118 WE WERE BEGINNING to move now . We were getting along toward the materialization , in part at least , of our long-cherished dream . The ancient craft of hand-weaving was being revived in many a mountain home . Down in the coves and along the slopes of the Blue Ridge women toiled happily at looms and over boiling dyepots ; they were fashioning materials of practical value and great aesthetic significance . For many the revival of weaving meant money with which to send their children off to college , or to provide needed medical or surgical care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At times the market for their products had been slow , of course , but over the years they had been working , it had been generally good , and having something to sell from time to time for many women in our region had been a veritable godsend . To me the joy of knowing that the wonderful craft of 119 hand-weaving was not to die , but instead would be nurtured and perhaps even improved upon as eager and imaginative and responsive souls became interested in it , outweighed even the happiness I had in seeing our project becoming financially successful . But one thing was beginning to give me concern . As the gradually completed Craft House grew in value , I became more and more uncomfortable . Since the property on which it was built belonged to me personally , the Craft House was actually my personal property . I knew that was n't right ; it was n't the way I wanted it . All the donations of logs , windows , doors , plumbing , wiring and labor had not been given to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed on my conscience that I was driven to consult two of the cleverest lawyers I have known , Mr. John McBee , Sr. , of Spruce Pine and Mr. Haywood Parker of Asheville . I told them my problem . I wished to deed the property to a self-perpetuating board of trustees , and I wanted as trustees local people who would know and appreciate the community and its needs and level-headed businessmen who could advise me and help me to make important decisions properly . I explained that almost without my realizing it we had grown into an important and imposing craft school ; we had done it too without my knowing that we were going to , and I told them I was afraid it was getting to be too much for me . They listened carefully to my story , as good lawyers do , and then both advised me against deeding to a board of trustees . They gave a number of sound reasons . In the first place the school would never have attained the position it had reached if it had been under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have allowed you to undertake the things you have undertaken and done , " they 120 explained . " It 's a good thing you were n't hampered by having such a board . " Their advice was not to deed but to make a will leaving the property to a board of trustees . I allowed myself to be persuaded , and all three of us worked on the will to make it fit the needs of the school 's future and at the same time be foolproof . One lawyer would do what he could with it , and then I would take it to the other to see if he could shoot any legal holes in it . And finally it was finished . We all thought it a good will . I liked it . For a year or two we went along under this arrangement , but still I was not comfortable about that will . Suppose I should live to be really old ? old enough not to think too clearly ? and should make other plans for that property . Legally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , but morally it was n't . I went back to the lawyers . " You 'll have to make that will into a deed , " I told them . And it was done . To the board of trustees I appointed Bonnie Willis Ford , whose family had been a pillar of strength in the community as she had been a pillar of strength to me in the school ; Clementine Douglas , with whom I had worked hand in hand in the Southern Highlands Handicraft Guild ; Mr. B. C. Burgess , who had been a staunch friend and a wise counselor throughout the years ; Mr. Jason Deyton , the first superintendent of Mitchell County schools to possess a college degree ; and Edward Fortner , cashier of the Bank of Spruce Pine . Bonnie had helped me select the board members , and looking back upon it , I think we could not have made better choices . Mr. Burgess ' duties were unchanged now that he was a board member , but his name was listed on the school stationery . The same was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 121 she kept the minutes of the meetings . Clementine Douglas came over from Asheville to bring spice , zest and a world of wisdom and foresight to the board sessions . Jason Deyton 's life from the time of his graduation from the University of North Carolina practically parallels the history of the Mitchell County public school system . He is an educator , an idealist and , I insist , an artist and a poet , whether or not he has ever painted a picture or written a poem . As for Ed Fortner , I can truthfully say that he always believed in us more than we believed in ourselves , and that fact challenged us to stay on our toes . And he was cashier of the bank , and heaven knows we needed friends in that bank . The agreement we had made with Bishop Horner concerning the status of the Appalachian School and community weaving , incidentally , held good until after the beloved bishop was gone and a new bishop had taken his place . That was during the Depression . The Appalachian School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had lived gloriously during the boom years and then had been laid low by lack of sales for that long lean period , was sadly in the red indeed . The bishop and others concerned got their heads together , and we all decided it would be best for the school to go its way without responsibility for the weaving , and for the weaving to go its separate way on whatever resources it might be able to achieve and command . So when I made the deed of the property over to the board of trustees , it embraced the community weaving program as well as the school for students from out in the world . The deed was properly recorded , and the Penland School of Handicrafts was incorporated under the laws of North Carolina as a nonprofit educational institution . 122 " Miss Lucy , " someone will often say to me , " operating this school up here at Penland , you must meet a lot of interesting people . " I do . That has been one of the joys of living and working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run all over the world to do it ; they come to you . Already persons interested in handicrafts have come to Penland from some fifty-five different nations in almost every part of the world . And many have come year after year , or have come and then decided to stay for good , as members of our faculty . We have been fortunate in being able to obtain persons highly proficient in their crafts and peculiarly fitted for teaching them , even though always we have had little money for salaries . Such a man is Mr. Peters . The first summer we were in the Craft House one of our 123 students was Mr. Rupert Peters , director of visual education in the Kansas City public schools . When he came to Penland , ' Mr. Peters had been weaving less than a year ; for instruction he had been using Mr. Worst 's book , Foot-Power HandWeaving . We soon discovered that he was a perfectionist , and at the end of his stay he had become such an excellent craftsman that we asked him to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , and he did . He has been teaching at Penland every summer since , and when he was retired in Kansas City he built his home here and now teaches the year round . I really do n't know how many years we conducted a summer school before we paid any teacher a salary . Mr. Worst , of course , charged us nothing , and everybody must have known that we had nothing to pay . But after years of no salaries , we did begin to pay some teachers a very small salary , just a little bit , because I was ashamed not to . One summer , I recall , we were paying Mr. Peters the handsome sum of a hundred fifty dollars for teaching twelve weeks ; another teacher , also from Kansas City , said he happened to know that Mr. Peters had been offered a hundred dollars a week for twelve weeks to teach in another school . That disturbed me . It was just too much to let pass . So I sought out Mr. Peters , told him what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I appreciate your loyalty , but I just ca n't allow you to turn down a salary of a hundred dollars a week . You just ca n't afford to be that loyal . " " Miss Lucy , " he replied , its worth the difference just to be in a place like this where there are no requirements , grades , papers to correct , or rules , and where students do n't have to be urged but are here because they want what we have to 124 offer . It 's an interesting place to be , with interesting and congenial people to be with . I 'm staying here . " If Penland and $150 was worth as much to him as some other place and $1,200 ? well , what else could I say ? And I had to confess that I felt the same way about it . We think that Mr. Peters ' training in visual education is an excellent background for a teacher of weaving , and we think nobody could give a better course in basic weaving than he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there 's something else that helps , too . The twinkle in his eyes , and his quiet , kindly humor provide the key that reveals a personality perfectly suited to a teaching role at Penland . There 's Martha Pollock , too . She came to us as a student under the GI Bill and specialized in hand-weaving . We never had a more apt pupil , and when she had been here a year she was designing her own weaving patterns in multiple-harness techniques . Even before Martha left Penland , a linen tablecloth that she had designed and woven was accepted at an international textile exhibition and was awarded first prize in napery . Martha Pollock now has her own studio in Beverly Hills , California , and designs and creates fabrics for interior decorators , among them Bill Haines , one-time movie star and now an interior decorator . Her creations have been pictured and described in House Beautiful and in various craft publications . The name Martha Pollock is well known in the world of craftsmen . We are proud of Martha as designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gracious mother as people . The only possible criticism we could make of the two is that they have put too much distance between themselves and Penland . I could go on for a long time , in fact , naming persons of 125 whom we are proud , persons who came to Penland and very distinctly left their imprint upon us . I am thinking at the moment of two such women , one Swedish , the other Danish . One summer the Lears had as their guest Mr. Kendall Wisegar , who had gone to college with Pop Lear . Mr. Wisegar brought with him an exhibit of unusual and very beautiful weaving done by Mrs. Margaret Bergman of Poulsbo , Washington . Mrs. Bergman had designed her own patterns in multipleharness techniques , and we were all so greatly impressed with her work that I wrote Mrs. Bergman and asked her if she would consider coming to Penland for the next summer , even though all we could pay her were transportation and living expenses . She replied that she would be glad to come . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms of her own design and taught us her very special methods and techniques . Mrs. Bergman was Swedish and spoke English with enough difficulty that it was easier for her to demonstrate than to explain by speaking . But that year we had as a student Irene Beaudin of Canada , who was able to put into words Mrs. Bergman 's instructions . Irene worked closely with Mrs. Bergman and was an apt interpreter . It was a great experience to know this wonderful Swedish woman . She was kind and gentle and eager to pass on her craft skills . Her hands and fingers knew weaving as none other I have ever known . They seemed to know what to do without being directed by her mind . And besides this great skill , Mrs. Bergman had a delicious and twinkling sense of humor . Although she was perhaps seventy-five when she came to us , 126 Mrs. Bergman joined in the folk-dancing with agility and grace . She even taught us the Swedish Weavers ' Dance , which has become a Penland favorite . It was while Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Penland . She was the Danish lady , Mrs. Emmy Sommer of Copenhagen . She was teaching weaving as occupational therapy at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington . Mrs. Sommer 's specialty was tapestry weaving , and she had done some of the restoring of tapestries for the famous Gobelin Art Gallery . She taught us about tapestry , including much that is not in books and not done on looms . Mrs. Sommer was one of the great souls it has been my happy privilege to know . 127 THE RESCUE FROM oblivion of the wonderful craft of hand-weaving which had begun to disappear with the passing of the elderly women who had learned it from their mothers and grandmothers in mountain homes , had been for years my driving passion . This was Mr. Worst 's craft , and his interest in it and his pre-eminence among those who taught it naturally heightened my concern for its preservation . So during the first years of our school we taught only weaving . But as the school 's fame spread , we began to receive letters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the experience of a summer at Penland , in exchange for which they would be glad to teach their respective specialties . So that 's how we got started in other handicrafts . Pottery was the first addition , and we began teaching it in 128 the little log stable , which was actually the only place available at the time . I remember going one day to Charlie Tipton , our man of all work . " Charlie , some friend of Bishop Horner 's is giving us a pottery kiln , " I told him . The friend does n't want his name to be known ; maybe he thinks we would ask for other gifts . Anyway , he heard I had done some work in pottery when I was up with Mr. Worst last winter , and he 's giving us a big , heavy metal kiln that is too heavy to put on any floor we have . The only thing I know to do is to clean out that old log stable and use it as a pottery . " So they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all the loose dirt , leaving the hard-packed earth for the floor . Then the freight train brought our kiln and we had it hauled up the slope to its home . After the kiln was in place , Bascom Hoyle built a flue for it . To assure the flue 's having a proper draft , we got a long metal drainpipe , a corrugated thing that certainly gave our old stable a strange modern touch , and set it into the flue . When summer came , Mr. Worst brought down a potter who was working with him , a Mr. Fowler , and our pottery department was on its way . Two of our young neighbors , John Morgan and Rufus Wyatt , were among the first to become interested in this craft . They were constant companions of Tony Ford , who had the charm of perpetual youth . Tony had learned a great deal about wild flowers , particularly the unusual and lovely ones to be found on the mountain tops . While off superintending crafts over the state , Tony would spend his Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not going to church , he would declare that God did a good job 129 with His flowers and shrubs , but He really needed someone to help Him . And so the three could usually be found puttering around the old stable , working not only with the kiln but with flowers and plants too . They made such a beauty spot of the grounds around the stable that visitors would stop to look , explore and revel . Many of the plants brought down from the mountains were quite rare and guests would ask about them . Tony could answer any of their questions , but the boys seldom knew which name belonged to what plant . Tony had cautioned them to avoid saying , " I do n't know , " even to make up a name if they had to . One day when a lady asked Rufus the name of a certain flower she was admiring , Rufus compromised : " I do n't know , lady , " he said , " but I think it 's an anthem . " Rufus quickly learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon making things to sell as a part of our community activities . During the time we were establishing the pottery I got involved in another project . Mary Clark invited me to visit her in Bronxville where she was taking evening classes in metalwork . One night she took me along with her . With the others I learned how to hammer pewter disks into plates . After hammering out three plates in different sizes , I told myself that next to weaving this was the most fun I 'd ever had . And so I inveigled the instructor into selling me three molds and three leather-covered hammers , which I happily took home with me . As soon as Mary arrived at Penland that summer , we ordered pewter ; then she and John Morgan and Rufus Wyatt hammered out plates that sold almost as fast as they could could make them . They were working in Morgan Hall , but 130 the hammering was so noisy that we decided another place would have to be found . So we moved the equipment down to the old stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and pottery . Now , with so much going on in the stable , we began to notice that it was really showing its age . It had been serving in many capacities over the years , and it was getting in bad shape . The logs next to the ground were badly rotted , much of the chinking had dropped out from between others , and one corner of the building was settling down . The poor old thing looked worn and discouraged . One day I spoke to Charlie Tipton about it . " The pottery is our most picturesque building , Charlie , " I said . " It would break my heart if it should tumble down . Ca n't you do something to make it a little more stable ? Could n't you prop it up at the corners , or fix a frame inside for it to sort of lean on ? " He shook his head doubtfully , but he went down to the stable and looked it over thoroughly . When he came back to report he was still shaking his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if I go in there and commence hammerin ' around , that buildin 's going to fall on me . " " Well , Charlie , " I assured him , " you are more valuable than any building . I reckon we 'll just have to let it go . " But I still was n't reconciled to seeing the stable deteriorate . A little later Mr. Angel was up at the school , the man who had had charge of building the Craft House . Mr. Angel was a contractor and builder and an expert with logs , as he had already demonstrated to us . I told him about the old log stable and asked him if he thought anything could be done to save it . He went down and investigated . He stuck his knife into some of the logs , hit others with a hammer and listened to the 131 sound , inspected the structure from ground to loft . Then he figured , and he gave me a price for which he would rejuvenate the building . Then I began to get cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you to get hurt working for us . We need you around here . Do you think there 's any danger of that pottery falling on you ? " He looked at me and his eyes twinkled , and in the characteristic understatement of the man of the mountains he replied , " Miss Lucy , I ai n't never yet had a building fall on me . " Mr. Angel went to work . He propped up the sunken corner and replaced bad logs , poured a concrete floor that extended under the walls and put new chinking between the logs . When he had finished , the old stable had renewed youth but had not lost its old charm . That old log stable is still in use . In it we teach how to make lamp shades , and non-fired pottery which is related to kiln pottery but is quite a different craft . It serves too as the darkroom for our photography department and has all the equipment necessary for that work . The little stable has been added to , propped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most picturesque buildings on our campus . We are happy that it did not go the way of many other old log buildings that once dotted our mountain slopes and valleys . Before I leave pottery for a discussion of other crafts that we began teaching , I want to mention one of our teachers who gave life and vigor to the course in pottery . Peggy Jamieson , like so many of our Penland folk , made a profession of her craft ; she now has her own pottery on Merritt Island , Florida . Peggy always enjoyed the charm of the place and its people , 132 but particularly engaging for her was the saucy little Carolina wren that built a nest right above the potter 's wheel and raised a family there with constant scoldings for those who invaded its neighborhood . Our interest in metal work led us to establish a department to teach metal work and jewelry making . This was taught by Mr. Clyde Miller , whose wife had registered with us for weaving . He wrote that he would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay his expenses by teaching his craft . We welcomed him . He taught his classes in the old stable along with the pottery classes , and he was a very good teacher . Soon we began to see that we would have to find some other place for the metalcraft classes . There just was n't enough room in the stable . So now I can tell about Radcliffe House . During those early days of the school a friend had given us $1,500 toward the building of a structure to be named for our community nurse . Carrie Radcliffe was an obstetrical nurse and midwife ; one year she delivered fifty-one babies in fiftytwo weeks . A natural-born missionary , she gave her services in exchange for whatever the patients might be able and willing to pay . We decided to build Radcliffe House as a place where mothers could go to have their babies under Carrie 's watchful care and direction . But before it was finished , our county established a central health office with public health service , and we felt that it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been planned to serve . But we had other needs . We always do ! So in the main Radcliffe House became , and continues to be today , a dormitory . We started using it , as we have all our buildings , long be-133 fore it was finished . Students and teachers slept upstairs when there was nothing but rough studding between the rooms and there were no doors and windows . And we moved the metalcraft classes a hundred yards up the hill to Radcliffe House and gave them a home on the first floor . Then came the summer when all the rooms in that building had been enclosed , and our summer family had so grown that we desperately needed every room for sleeping quarters . Jealously we began to eye the space being used by the metalcrafters . But if we threw them out of Radcliffe as we had thrown them out of the old stable , where would they go ? And we did n't want to withdraw those courses ; they were becoming increasingly popular and excellent work was done . But registrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow students ? Well , our men got busy and in three days they built , at the enormous expense of $75 , an outdoor metal shop . It was ready when the students began to arrive . This shop , which we still use , has a floor , a roof , and walls just a few feet high . The rest is screened . In the summer time it is a pleasant place in which to work , because the soft breezes blow through it unhampered . There 's no problem of ventilation ! But we can not use it in the cold winter months , of course , and what metalcraft is done during that part of the year is done in the basement of Radcliffe . Right now we are yearning for a year-round metal shop . And I 'm of the opinion we 'll get it . Providence seems to look with special kindness upon orphans , widows and old maids running mountain schools . Our general pottery course was growing in popularity too and soon it began to outgrow the log stable . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally used for 134 a wood shop where looms were built before shortage of labor and materials made this impractical . The upper floor of this hillside building is the ground floor from the pottery shop entrance , and the wood shop , now the school 's maintenance shop , is on the floor below , which is the ground floor on its level . The structure served very well its dual purpose , but we realized it was only a shell of a building and hardly suited for year-round use . If we could only make of it a more permanent , all-weather building , we thought , how much more efficiently it would serve us . But how ? Once more , an answer came . Five young men and five young women were sent to us in 1948 by the American Friends Service Committee for what they called a work camp . Such groups are sent to localities where projects of special interest to these young people are in operation , and they get college credits for living in the community and working on the project chosen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania State , University of Chicago , Antioch and several other universities and colleges . As interesting and co-operative a group as one could wish to have , they certainly gave as much to our community as we could ever expect them to learn from us . They were mature beyond their years ; and they entered into the social life of the school and the neighborhood , took part in church services in our rural areas , and enriched us generally . They added zest to our folk dances and made permanent friends throughout the community . With the ten was their director , the Reverend Walter Kring , plus Mrs. Kring and their two children . Mr. Kring , whose hobby was pottery , was pastor of the Unitarian Church in Worcester , Massachusetts . And what do you think this group had been assigned to do ? 135 You guessed it : build stone walls for our pottery and maintenance building . We had arranged with Mart Grindstaff to supervise the work of the students , which had been planned for a year before their arrival . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penland and he had taken a look at them , he shook his head sadly . Those college boys and girls ? What did they know about rock work ? " Miss Lucy , " said Mart to me one day , " it 'll be a sight cheaper just to hire two or three good men and get this job done , even if them boys and girls do work for nothin ' . They 'll just mess up a lot o ' good rock , and all they doll have to be done over . " But I told him that the students were on a work-camp project and we 'd have to let them see what they could do . Maybe he 'd be surprised anyway , I suggested . Well , when those boys and girls came to Mart and literally sat at his feet to glean his words of wisdom on rock-setting , and continued to do so all summer , you could actually see Mart growing in stature and self-esteem . And those youngsters worked ! The girls put on their blue jeans and worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They lugged stones , made mortar , laid the stones in place . And as the work went on , Mart and the ten became fast friends . Once Mart invited the group to a Sunday dinner at his home . He told them , however , that they would n't have anything but cornbread and beans . They , believing him , assured him that they would love to come , that they were particularly fond of cornbread and beans . When they got to Mart 's house that Sunday , of course , Mart had everything you could think of on his table ? fried chicken , 136 country ham , all the vegetables of the season , pies , cakes , jellies , jams . And how those college youngsters did stuff themselves ! Mart appreciated them and they adored Mart . He still hears from them all . A few years later one of them brought his bride to Penland and spent a part of his honeymoon with the Grindstaffs. 137 // N THE EVENING when the busy day 's work was finished , we would gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were never idle . He delighted in making things . And he seemed just as happy to show others how to make things . He demonstrated how to make dolls , woolly animals , and handbags from rug roving . Children 's caps he made from looper clips . With materials near at hand he fashioned beautiful and fragrant bayberry candles , floating candles and other unusual things . Mr. Worst 's fireside industry was contagious . Other teachers and students had pet projects , and soon both watching and participating groups grew beyond the limit of the fireplace circle . Gathered around one table could be found a group making papier-mache objects ; at another table puppets might be the main interest ; at still another one could watch character dolls being made of corn shucks . 138 We usually had some occupational therapists at Penland . In addition , there were often a number of 4-H Club workers , Girl Scout leaders , rehabilitation workers or others in related fields who were always on the alert for projects requiring little financial outlay , projects that could be completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new project of this kind was introduced it had an immediate hearing , and the simple crafts quickly grew in popularity and significance . One summer we had two students who were particularly adept at these crafts . Ruth Harris and Floride Stoddard taught us how to make so many things that we asked them to come back to Penland the following summer and teach for half of every day in exchange for their room , board and tuition . Thus was born a new department which we called Related Crafts . One can now learn from sixty to seventy different techniques , among them stenciling , block printing , spatterwork , finger painting , crayon resist , papier-mache work , chip carving , guimpe work , chair-seating , and making bobbin lace , felt articles , puppets and masks , rug-roving dolls and animals . Most of these are comparatively simple , though some very professional work is being done in silk-screen printing and in leather work . The first chair-seating we did was taught by two of our good neighbors , Mr. Arthur Woody and his daughter Miss Decie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of seating chairs with hickory bark , as their forebears did before them . Many a twinkle have I seen in their eyes as they marveled at the number of thumbs people can have on two hands . Mr. Woody had been seating chairs a long time ; he was no amateur at that task . One morning when Mr. Woody came 139 up to the school a city student greeted him cordially . " Good morning , Mr. Woody . How are you ? " he asked . " Tol'able , just tol'able , " the old gentleman replied . And his eyes sparkled . " But I can do more than most boys of ninetythree . " And that was the solemn truth . Mr. Woody died a few years ago , only a little short of his century mark . It rejoices my heart that three of the stalwart , honest , worthy grandsons of Mr. Woody are carrying on in the footsteps of their father and grandfather in a much larger way as proprietors of Woody 's Chair Shop on Grassy Creek just out of Spruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit at the Craftsman 's Fair at Asheville in the summer of 1957 included scale models of their Betsy Ross and Colonial American chairs . And I want to tell what happened as a result of that exhibit . It happened that a lady from Norfolk , Virginia , saw it . She told Walter and Arval Woody that she collected rare and unusual dolls from all over the world ; she had paid as much as $600 for one particular doll . She told them that she had looked for years for good-quality furniture small enough to display her dolls , but until she saw the Woody exhibit she had been unsuccessful in her search . She wanted a complete set of the Betsy Ross chairs and various other pieces of furniture in miniature . Arval and Walter talked it over and decided they could make the furniture . They told her , however , that because of the difficulty of the work they would have to charge her the same price for the doll furniture that they would have charged for full-size furniture of the same models . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The complete order consisted 140 of six Betsy Ross side chairs , a Betsy Ross rocker , a Betsy Ross arm rocker , a Gout rocker , a **26;448;TOOLONG doll table fifteen inches high , and a mammy bench . They were all made of solid walnut and beautifully done . We have craftsmen in our mountains ! The Woodys have adapted their work to the tastes of their own generation and are making beautiful chairs and tables and other handsome pieces of furniture to order , using black walnut , butternut , wild cherry , maple and other indigenous hardwoods . The beauty and comfort of my own living room is enriched by pieces they have made for me . But their beautiful furniture goes far afield from Penland . Our student Maria Halva from Helsinki , Finland , was so intrigued with the Woody rocking chairs that she actually took one with her when she returned to Finland by freighter , and rocked as she sailed ! Before I get away from Mr. Arthur , Miss Decie and Mr. Arthur 's grandsons , I want to tell of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mrs. Leila Woody , widow of Barney Woody , and I think Arthur and Barney were not related . Mrs. Woody is one of our community weavers , but recently she had to give up weaving because of ill health . She lives with one of her daughters . I wish to relate the story of Mrs. Woody 's famous coverlet , not because of the beauty of the coverlet ? and it is an amazingly beautiful piece of work ? but because of her ability to make something of such beauty with things at hand . Mrs. Woody , I think , illustrates the ability of our people to improvise , to adapt themselves to their circumstances , to do , and do with great success , with what they have or are able to procure . Who could n't make something beautiful and useful if she 141 had the appropriate materials , the necessary tools , and the ability and will to create ? But I wonder how many of us , given a bag of looper clips , a waste product of hosiery mills , could produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Woody 's niece worked in a hosiery mill , and one day she brought her aunt a bag of looper clips . Mrs. Woody raveled out several of the loopers and discovered that each had not less than eighteen yards of raveled thread . So she planned an eighteen-yard warp . She warps with ten ends , so she drove ten nails in a board and fastened this board to the wall . She put a looper on each nail and on her warping bar warped eighteen yards . Then she cut off the ends , put up ten more loopers , tied the ten threads to the ends she had just warped , and continued with her warping until she had the necessary 1,080 threads , each eighteen yards long , which are required for a thirty-six-inch warp for a coverlet . A honeycomb weave was what Mrs. Woody wanted , and for such a weave a fine thread is used for the background and a heavy thread for the honeycomb . The ravelings were all right for the fine thread and she used the loopers and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled and twisted the ravelings several times to produce a thread of the size she wanted ! The fringe she made of doubled and twisted looper ravelings . That coverlet has been a great inspiration to me . But even more so has Mrs. Woody , not only to me , but to many others . After her husband had an operation and was having a long , slow convalescence , she knew that she could not keep him from doing things that would be harmful to him unless she 142 could find some way to keep him busily occupied . So she persuaded him to weave , which he did well and happily . Among those who have been inspired by our Mrs. Woody are many foreign students . We had a picture made one day of her and her gorgeous coverlet , and standing by admiring it were Mr. Guillermo Mendoza , director of vocational education in the Philippines ; Maria Halva , supervisor of needlecraft schools in Helsinki , Finland ; Michito Sato of Japan , Bobg Wha Kim and Huun Ja Kim of Korea , the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of the national YWCA . Once when we were having a Guild workshop at Penland , someone suggested that it was so very sad to think that those who do the weaving can not afford to own the beautiful products of their own handicraft . I made no comment , but hopped into my little car and went out to Mrs. Woody 's . " Mrs. Woody , I want you to come with me and disprove that idea they have , " I said , after I had explained the situation . " I want you to show them not only how weaving is done but how our woven material is used in our own community . " She readily agreed . We took a coverlet off her bed and woven place mats and napkins off her dining table ; we picked up a bureau scarf from the bureau . Then Mrs. Woody and her daughter put on their own hand-woven dresses , and back we went to Penland and our commiserating friends . I was just as proud to introduce Mrs. Woody as I would have been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked her to show them her hand-woven things , especially the coverlet , and I suggested that she tell them how she made it . She did . Speaking with great graciousness and poise , 143 she gave one of the best , most interesting talks of that conference . But let me get on with my story of the development of the Related Crafts Department . After it had evolved from Mr. Worst 's busy fingers in front of an open fireplace , with interested admirers intently watching him , the students were taught in a narrow daylight basement room of the Craft House , which was not heated and could be used only in the summertime . In the summer of 1947 we had an outstanding student in that department , Mrs. Eulalia Burns . She was such a good student , in fact , that I asked her if she would remain as a teacher the year around . Well , Mrs. Burns accepted my offer . But she could n't stay in that cold basement room of the Craft House , because winter was coming on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place with teeth chattering and breath making white mist patterns . That year for the first time we had the use of the new building that I will tell of later , The Pines , which had furnace heat . We had now accepted students under the GI Bill to study with us during the full-year period . Proudly we had evolved from a short summer-period school to full-term status , with the only difference that our vacation period comes in mid-winter . Brave and resourceful Mrs. Burns moved her equipment into the basement of The Pines and there functioned efficiently , along with the furnace and all sorts of stored materials , and with little ventilation and only artificial light . But somehow she managed to keep her students busy and happy . Then , when summer came , she moved into Radcliffe House , where the welcome rays of the sun stream through many win-144 s dows and the air is fresh and bracing . And after two years of such moving back and forth , we managed to get heat into Radcliffe and Mrs. Burns and Related Crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our student body was growing to such proportions that more room was needed and the Related Crafts room became a five-bed men 's dormitory during the summer . But by that time the Lily Loom House was being built ? a project which I shall happily tell about later ? and Mrs. Burns and I fairly purred with satisfaction as we planned roomy , functional quarters to serve as the permanent home of an expanded Related Crafts Department . The fact that Mrs. Burns had never complained ? and who does complain at Penland ? ? made my elation all the more understandable . 145 BUT IN MY eagerness to relate the story of Penland 's extension of its curriculum in handicraft studies ? and it is always a temptation for me to get ahead of the chronology in my enthusiasm for the handicrafts themselves ? I have failed to record the effect upon our little community of a happening in New York that quickly had momentous repercussions throughout America and the world . I am referring , of course , to the stock market crash in 1929 , when billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was founded that year , if indeed we can actually put down a definite date . Strange to relate , the crash of the stock market meant nothing more to us folk back in the mountains of North Carolina than black headlines in the newspapers ? so we thought . But not for long . Soon the great Depression was withering the land and in not 146 many months Penland too was feeling the effects of world conditions . We had managed to get our community weaving program well under way and in many homes back in the coves the women were working into the night to produce handwoven products that we were selling for them at good prices . The revenue was sending their children to school , improving their homes and doing other good things of tremendous importance to them . But with the coming of the Depression the bottom dropped out of our market . We had a Weaving Cabin stocked with beautiful articles and no way of disposing of them . What would we do ? We studied and we figured and we sought suggestions . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt and hopelessness , and as I look back now , I feel that our greatest successes and achievements came as direct results of the struggling we had to do to overcome what seemed at times insurmountable difficulties . We knew that a World 's Fair was to be held in 1933 in Chicago , and we knew that we had friends in that great city , including Mr. Worst . People began to ask us if by any chance Penland would have an exhibit at the Fair , and of course we said we would not . How could we get to Chicago with an exhibit when we could hardly make ends meet at Penland ? But as we thought about it and remembered the Weaving Cabin filled with wonderful hand-woven articles for which Penland had no market , we began to get ideas . Maybe , just maybe , if we could have an exhibit in Chicago we might be able to sell some of those products . I called the weavers together ? I always did that when there was much at stake , so that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considering . If we could get our 147 weaving and our hand-hammered pewter to Chicago , I said , we might be able to sell it . " But even if we can get a concession at the fair , we 'll be taking a tremendous risk , " I warned them , " because it will cost a lot of money , which we do n't have . " " Then how do you aim to manage it ? " one of them asked me . I had foreseen , of course , that such a question would be asked ; it invariably happens that way . " First of all , I need the help of you weavers , " I told her . " If we sell anything , we will probably sell a lot , even more than we have on hand now . So if we decide to go into this thing , I 'd want every weaver who is willing to run the risk to weave all this winter . And understand this : there wo n't be any money to pay you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great that we may lose everything we have , and you may never get paid . " But this I do know , " I went on . " As things are now , we ca n't pay you , and we know that we 're already lost unless something happens . This is a gamble . We may lose , but we may win . This is the way I look at it : I 'd rather put every ounce of energy I have into this , and then go down with a bang , than to die by inches . I 'd know that I 'd done everything I knew how to do . " I could see that the weavers were inclined to go along with my view . " But even so , " I hastened to tell them , " I do n't want you to be too much influenced by me ; I want you to use your own judgment on weaving all winter . If any of you would rather not take that risk , and then we should succeed , I 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , every weaver without hesitation said that of 148 course she would weave , that she had nothing to lose but her time . And since it would be during the winter when there were no gardening and canning to be done , there would be plenty of time for weaving . So it was agreed . Then I wrote Mr. Paul Bernat of Emile Bernat &; Sons Company , from whom we were buying all our weaving supplies . I explained the situation to Mr. Bernat as I had explained it to the weavers ; I told him that if his company would be willing to supply us with yarns until our Chicago venture had succeeded or failed , I would be pleased , but that if he thought the risk too great , I would understand . That courageous and noble man wrote me to order what we needed and pay for it when we could . His letter was almost in the same words of the Spruce Pine Lumber Company people when we discussed with them the building of the Craft House . Next we invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various churches in the community , representatives of civic organizations , and other friends to a dinner at the school . It was really a mass meeting to discuss the merits of having a Mitchell County exhibit at the World 's Fair . North Carolina as a state was not exhibiting , we had been informed , and it seemed all the more important that our county provide an exhibit . That was the feeling of the group , too , and quickly it pledged $500 toward promotion of the venture . So off to Chicago I trekked to see what I could find out . We had no money for a concession , and very quickly and plainly , I felt , the World 's Fair people showed they had little or no interest in us . But there were several influential persons supporting us , including Mr. Worst , Dr. Howard W. Odum 149 of the University of North Carolina sociology department , and Miss Helen Bennett , who headed the Women 's Division of the Fair , and I had the feeling that the Fair folk did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put off we would give up and go home . But I was not willing to give up . I was staying with my good friend Mrs. Evans in Berwyn at no expense to me or the school and I spent nine weeks pleading , figuring , arguing , urging and being put off . I was getting mighty discouraged . One day as I boarded a suburban train for Berwyn after another dreary and unproductive session with those Fair folk , I had had about enough . They had n't quite said no , but I felt they would the next time I confronted them , and I was almost defeated . I thought of the letters I had been getting from those back in Mitchell County recounting their doings to raise money toward that $500 . They believed in us implicitly , I knew , and yet I was about to fail them . I was sitting by a friend , and I turned to her . " Tell me a funny story quick , " I said . " I think I 'm going to cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very next day one of the officials at the Fair telephoned me to come in . When I got there he told me that we could have a small portion of land ? which was really nothing but a breakwater ? between Ann Rutledge Tavern and the Lincoln group . The charge for it , he said , would be a certain percentage of the sales made , and he warned me that it would be so difficult to make use of those few feet of land , which was covered with large boulders , that it would be prohibitively expensive and we could not hope even to make expenses on such a concession . I told him we would take it . And with great relief that we 150 had a place on which to exhibit , even if it seemed to be a very poor place , I wired Tony Ford , who was at that time teaching in Stillwater , Oklahoma . Tony got in touch with the boys at Penland , and they came out to Chicago . There they lifted and heaved and shoved those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to accommodate the two little sevenby-twelve cabins that Tony and the boys had built some months before . One had been constructed as a trailer and we had used it as a traveling gift shop ; the other was made of lumber hewn to look like logs , with each piece fitted into place so that it could be taken down and hauled to the Fair and then reassembled . Tony had supervised and helped in making the ground ready for the cabins . By this time we were beginning to feel that we were putting on the World 's Fair ourselves . The boys had returned to Penland to get the knocked-down cabin , and Tony and the boys began putting it up ? and found themselves embroiled with the labor-union people . That little cabin was so small that they had n't discovered it until our boys started nailing on the hand-riven shingles , and then they had insisted on taking over . We got it settled , however , and we were thankful that they had n't discovered us sooner . We did n't take the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fair . Then my nephew Ralph Morgan , Holmes Wyatt , Ernest.Morton and I departed Penland in the midst of great excitement . It was fun all along the way , too , for when we stopped for gas , groups gathered and asked questions . At some of the stops persons even offered to buy the cabin . We got it safely to Chicago and parked it in Mrs. Evans ' back yard for a day or two , to the great delight of the neigh-151 borhood children , while we waited the day when we were supposed to take it into the fairgrounds and set it in place , so that it would be in readiness well before the opening date . Tony laid out the route over which we would take it from Berwyn to be sure that all the underpasses were high enough to permit its passage . Then the day came for us to move to the fairgrounds . I hoped that simple little log cabin would not feel embarrassed and inferior among all the ultramodern buildings there . But as we drove through those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched its roof a bit and felt a modest pride in being just as good and important for its own purposes as those skyscrapers and great glass palaces were for theirs . So we took our places with a feeling of achievement and dignity . Before the opening of the Fair I had spoken in and around Chicago before women 's auxiliaries of various Episcopal churches and they had generously offered to assist in making sales at our cabins . Incidentally , it was while she was helping with our sales that I met Mrs. McElwain , who subsequently came to Penland to spend three days and is still here more than twenty years later . Since I would n't be able to spend much time in Chicago during the Fair , because the weavers and I would be busy at home , I asked a former Penland teacher , Mrs. Hensley , to take charge of all details of organization and selling , and when the stage was all set and the opening had been recorded as a success , I returned to Penland . That first day at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to take many days to pay Emile Bernat all we owed , which was approximately a thousand dollars . I had never even seen a check for as much as that , much less written one . And in a few days there really was enough money to 152 warrant our writing a check for the entire amount we owed . Bonnie and I talked about it and glowed over it , and she wrote the check , because she not only writes a better hand than I do but she keeps the books and does the figuring . We both kissed that check and sent it on its way , and I wrote Mr. Bernat that I hoped he enjoyed getting it as much as we enjoyed sending it . And at Penland there was great rejoicing too ; the weavers all got paid . So the Chicago World 's Fair , from Penland 's standpoint at any rate , was a marvelous success . But our rewards were not entirely pecuniary . And that brings me to recall our good friend Mr. Hoppes , the banjo-picking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We seldom had friends come to Penland that we did not take them to visit the Hoppes family if time permitted . We would sit on the porch or , on winter evenings , around the open fire and bask in the genial and witty atmosphere of that home , listening to Mr. Hoppes ' delightful stories , interspersed with banjo music and song . Mr. Hoppes was so good at storytelling that actually I have recognized people on the streets of Spruce Pine just from his impersonations . I delighted in taking people out to the Hoppes house , and he seemed to enjoy their coming . " I reckon you have brought a thousand people out here , " he said to me one day , and I agreed . I suppose I have taken more than a thousand . I remember that on one particular evening we took a Greyhound busload of visitors out there ? though not in the bus , because it could never have made it over those roads . They were from Ball State Teachers College , and they had a most wonderful evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of anything we could do for Mr. 153 Hoppes as a sort of token of what he meant to us . We did try to keep him in banjo strings , but , after all , what is a banjo string when he and his family meant so much to us and to literally thousands of our friends ? It was wonderful just to be in his home . As we sat on the Hoppes front porch on summer evenings , watching the glimmer of glowworms in the yard and listening to the whip-poor-wills , peace and contentment would permeate our beings and we would be held spellbound by the spirit of things beautiful and good . One such evening during the months we were preparing to " assist in putting on the World 's Fair " and I was telling Mr. Hoppes of our plans for Chicago , he said to me , " If I could travel around as much as you do , I could make some awful pretty songs . " Right there the answer came . " That 's what we 'll do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoppes to the Chicago Fair . " Then I turned to him . " Mr. Hoppes , " I said , " would you be willing to go to the Fair with me and pick the banjo to draw a crowd so that we can sell more weaving ? " " Yes , " he answered without hesitation , " I 'd be glad to accommodate you like that . " To be sure , at that time I did n't know how we were going to buy gas to take ourselves to Chicago , but I knew that all his neighbors and all the visitors we should take to see him on his return would enjoy his stories about the Fair as long as he lived to tell them . What better investment could we make ? And I had an idea that Mr. Hoppes would really enjoy it . So we worked it out . On one of our several treks to the Fair that summer , Brother Ralph and I took Mr. Hoppes , and as we drove along in this little period of intermission between our busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticipating in Chicago we discussed various philosophical problems of living with our fellow men . Mr. Hoppes was a gentle but sustaining power in his own church and in his community generally and I always got as much good from his discussions as I would from a sermon . So I remember that one day as we were driving to Chicago I asked him if he had ever thought of being a preacher . " Yes , I did , " he replied . " I thought a lot about it when I was young . But I decided that the Lord gave me a talent , a talent for music , and that He meant for me to use it . That 's what I 've tried to do , to use my talent to help keep people happy and friendly . " Mr. Hoppes was one of my favorite philosophers . So we arrived in Chicago , and we took Mr. Hoppes out to the Fair . We set a chair by the rail fence in front of the cabins , and he took up his banjo and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered to listen and watch . I went back into the cabin to help with the sales and presently Mr. Hoppes came in . " Look here , " he said , " if you want me to pick that banjo , you 'll have to get somebody out here to do the handshaking . Some of those people out there have been right down home on my front porch , and they all want to shake hands , and I ca n't pick the banjo and shake hands at the same time , that 's a sure thing ! " " Mr. Hoppes , " I told him , " you 'll make just as many friends for Penland and help make just as many sales by shaking hands as you will by picking the banjo . So just take as much time for shaking hands as you need . " He did , and it worked out fine . As he said , many persons at the Fair had been his guests on his own front porch and they 155 were amazed and delighted to encounter again their jovial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and see everything that would mean most to himself and his neighbors after he had returned home , and I remember that the thing I had enjoyed most when I first went to Chicago was a boat trip to Milwaukee . I had n't been used to a big body of water , and that trip had meant a lot to me . I was confident Mr. Hoppes would enjoy such a trip , too ; so I asked Ralph to go with Mr. Hoppes to Milwaukee and back . On their return I asked our friend how he liked it . " I enjoyed the trip going over all right , " he said . " I did n't enjoy it so much coming back though , because there was n't nothing to see but water , and I saw that going over . " The first time we sat on the Hoppes porch after returning from the Fair , we had with us several Chicago people , and of course they wanted to hear from Mr. Hoppes about his experiences there and what he enjoyed most . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I enjoyed most , " he replied . Then Mrs. Hoppes spoke up . " Tell ' em about that taxi ride , Dock , " she suggested . So he told us that when they returned that day from Milwaukee Ralph asked a taxicab driver if he could get them over to Union Station in time for the ten-thirty train for Berwyn , where they were staying with our friend Mrs. Evans . " No , I do n't think I can , ' the taxi man told me and Ralph , " Mr. Hoppes related . " That there 's a fifteen-minute ride and we ai n't got but twelve minutes . But get in and I 'll try . ' " Well , sir , " Mr. Hoppes continued , " we had n't no sooner got in that-there taxi before that taxi man shot out o ' there 156 like a bolt o ' lightning . He went in and out of them postes and I do n't know how we kept from lamming agin one of ' em . But he did n't hit one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the other taxis and streetcars and everything that was a-passin ' us that if you had poked your finger down ' tween the fender of our taxi and all them other things that was a-passin ' us hit would a-mashed it ! " Mr. Hoppes was warming to his story . " By that time I said to Ralph , Ralph , ai n't he a-runnin ' over ever ' red light in town ? ' " No , I do n't think so , ' Ralph said . I think them 's caution lights . ' " Well , ' I said , if that 's what they are , he ai n't bein ' a bit cautious ! ' " When we got to the Union Station ' , the taxi man said , Here we are ! ' and stopped so sudden that it pulled us all right up on our feet , and all we had to do was just step out o ' the taxi . " He said they made their train . I saw and enjoyed more of the Chicago Fair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than I saw in Chicago . He did n't miss a trick , and what he saw and heard was pleasurably enhanced by his delightful wit . 157 DURING THESE EARLY years when the school was beginning to see its course ahead and look forward confidently to continuing growth , the Fords and I were living at Morgan Hall . Tony 's work was taking him away from Penland much of the time , but as often as he could he got home . Then in 1935 their son William Howard was born ; Bill he would be to us . That was an event we had been looking forward to , and I prayed for a real boy , rough and tough ? not bad , of course , but all boy ? and that 's what we got . I 'll never forget that day the telegram came from Tony over at Banner Elk 's hospital . " William Howard expected about noon today , " he wired . " Come on over . " Mr. Meacham read the telegram to me over the telephone . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began telling Mr. Meacham what it was all about , when I heard the click of 158 the receiver as he hung up . It was n't like him not to discuss news , and I felt a little let down . But I jumped in my little car , went over and picked up Mrs. Willis , Bonnie 's mother , and we set out for the hospital . " Now , Mrs. Willis , " I said to her , " you pray and I 'll drive . " " I 've been doing that ever since I left home , " she said . " Have n't you ? " Bill was everything we had asked for . But he was hungry and howling for food . They would n't feed him , though , until he was a certain number of hours old , which made me a little sad and a little mad too , and when I went to sleep that night I thought of that poor little hungry baby who could n't have any food . Tony asked me to send telegrams to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , he explained . So next morning I called up Mr. Meacham and proudly gave him the wires to send . " And tell Mrs. Meacham , Mr. Meacham , " I said , when I had finished with the telegrams . " I done told her yesterday , " he said . And then I understood why he had hung up on me . When Bill Ford was about two years old we had a year of very disconcerting experiences . As I look back now , I realize that it was a year of great significance for our school , a year of decisions , and what seemed then to be thorns in the flesh actually were goads urging us forward to larger horizons and greater achievements . The Appalachian School by this time had grown to the place where Morgan Hall was needed as a dormitory , and so we would have to make other plans not only for ourselves but also for dining room and kitchen facilities for the students and teachers of the summer sessions. 159 We had planned for the Craft House to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for teaching and sleeping ; but already we had set up looms all over the first floor and were using every foot of space in that building . What would we do ? We talked about the farmhouse on the property I had bought and which we used as overflow quarters . We talked about taking out partitions and making the first floor into a dining room and kitchen and screening the side porch to provide additional dining space . But Tony and the other men agreed it would cost more to do this than it would ever be worth , and they counseled that it would be better business to start from scratch and build a new dining room and kitchen . But the old bugaboo arose to taunt us again . We did n't have any money . The Pines , the name the old farmhouse was known by , was at least a start toward what we needed , and Bonnie and I decided that we could n't possibly face the gigantic problem of borrowing enough money to build a new structure ; we felt that we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We solved the problem of where we should live ourselves by moving into the little log cabin to which Rufus had brought his bride when he came to establish the school . The bishop had deeded it to me . It was one room and a lean-to downstairs , with a loft upstairs and a shelf for a sleeping porch . Our plan was to add two rooms to this cabin . Tony drew the plans and was ready to start work when I had to go to the hospital for an emergency major operation . Clementine Douglas invited me to go to her house in Asheville when I was ready to leave the hospital and remain there until I. could go 160 home , and I very happily did . The Fords would come over to see me and bring reports , and send them by others , concerning progress being made on the addition to our cabin . And then , a few days before I was to leave for home , that little cabin burned to the ground ! It had been a zero morning and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was explained to me later , and we supposed the added heat cracked the terra cotta flue , for it was in the flue that the fire had started . The family considered waiting a few days before telling me about the fire . But then they thought I might see it in the paper , or if it had been cut out of the paper I was given to read that I would wonder why and demand to know . So they consulted the doctor on what to do if when they did tell me the news was too disturbing , and he gave them directions . So they told me . My first comment was : " I hope they let little Bill see the fire . He is the only one who could enjoy it . " And I survived without having to undergo any of the emergency treatments that had been prescribed . The various descriptions of that fire were interesting . My nieces Helen and Esther Warner were with us for the winter , doing metal work for sale . After the fire had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day and had lunch there . Esther said that everybody was crying and she thought that she should cry too , but she could n't . Georgie had brought milk from home for Bill the morning of the fire , as she did each morning , and she rushed over and poured the milk on the fire , that being the only fire extinguisher she had . Afterwards they took Bill over to the Weaving Cabin across the road from the smouldering remains of our little cabin , and the baby would look out the window toward 161 the barn and observe wisely and calmly , " Cow say moo . " And for us there was little else to say . The Fords went up to The Pines , where Brother Ralph was batching , for his children were away at school and his wife away for the winter . Ralph welcomed the homeless and disconsolate warmly and comfortingly , and after a few days when I was ready to go home I joined them there . Friends everywhere seemed to get news of the fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " fire box " would arrive we would all gather around eagerly and divide the loot . We were all different sizes and shapes , so there was little argument about who should have what . Until after that fire I never knew how many colors I could wear happily . Nor had I ever known just how simple it was , I might describe the feeling as relieving , to have nothing . I determined that never again would I exert myself to collect " things , " since living can be so much simpler and less weighing upon one without them . We had decided before the fire to postpone doing over The Pines until spring so that the bills would not be too old before the summer guests should come in and make it possible for us to pay some of these bills . And now we had not only a dining room and kitchen to provide , but also a home for the Fords and me . Soon a letter came from Mr. Allen Eaton saying something like this : You have done rather well by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation , the fire . If there had been only one , your friends might hardly have noticed it ; if two , they might still have done nothing about it . But since you have had three , they really want to put their shoulders to the plough and do something . But do n't ever try staging a series of three again without consulting me first . " 162 Mr. Eaton , Miss Ann Morgan ( whom Bonnie and I had met through mutual friends ) , Mr. Lear at the University , and friends generally began exchanging letters , telegrams and telephone calls . With the financial assistance of everybody concerned , including the active interest of the businessmen of Spruce Pine , we were able to get to work on The Pines and our own little home as soon as spring broke and weather would permit . When time came for students and teachers to arrive , The Pines really looked attractive with the two front rooms and passage made into a dining room finished in knotty pine . Opening off the dining room was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof on the main part of the house , but the roof over the porch was the old one , and there were times that summer when we held umbrellas as we dined . This really embarrassed me a little , but our guests seemed to think they were having a lark . One thing the making over of The Pines did , we quickly discovered , was to disconcert whatever it was that had been making noises for which we could not account . Whether it was rats , mice , flying squirrels , bats , ghosts ? who knows ? I never saw them , but I certainly heard the noises many times . The old Pines had no running water in the house , only a faucet in the back yard just beyond the kitchen door . When bedtime came , any of us who happened to be living in the house were likely to go out to that faucet to brush our teeth the last thing before going to bed . Now this house , like many old farmhouses of our region , throughout the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a hall or passage . On each side of this hall was a room ? on the right a bedroom , on the left the living room . Back of the living room was the dining room and behind the 163 dining room was the kitchen . A door joined the living room and dining room and another the dining room and kitchen . One by one most of us had heard , always about midnight , the front door open and footsteps going along the hall into the living room , then the dining room , then the kitchen , and out through the kitchen door to the back porch . We took it for granted that it was a member of the family going out to the faucet to get a drink of water or to brush his teeth . But little by little we learned that nobody had been up and about at midnight when we had heard the footsteps . This was interesting , and quickly it became exciting . Every time we would hear our " ghost " we would report it the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time we heard the noises . And almost invariably no such midnight prowlers had been reported . Brother Ralph pooh-poohed what he termed such flights of our imagination , but his skepticism did n't decrease our interest and excitement , nor did it dull our hearing . And then one night when Ralph and his family were living in the house they had company and sat up visiting rather late . It happened that the only place Ralph had to sleep after taking care of the guests was on the couch in the dining room . As he tucked himself into his covers he looked at his watch and saw that it was midnight . He leaned over and blew out the lamp , stretched his long legs and settled down into his pillow . Then , very distinctly , he heard the front door open and footsteps coming along the hallway , then into the living room , and in a moment into the dining room within a few feet of where he was lying ! His first thought was that somebody was trying to play a trick on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp as quickly as he could , and rushed toward the 164 kitchen in pursuit of the footsteps . But just as he got to the kitchen he heard the door to the back porch slam , and as he sprang to open it before the intruder could get away he discovered that the door was securely locked from inside ! Ralph declared even then he was n't convinced that The Pines had a ghost . But he could n't explain it . 165 DURING ALL THE years that we were engaged in building Radcliffe and the outdoor metal shop and re-doing The Pines and building our little house , we were working also on the Edward F. Worst Craft House . It was continuing to grow ; in fact , it is not yet entirely finished in every nook and corner . Strange as it may sound , I was becoming sorry for future students who would not have the thrill of helping build the Craft House ; for each person who had given a log , a window , a room , or even a batch of shingles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself actually built into its physical plant . For those of the future who would not experience that great joy , I had sympathy . I believe at Penland we truly appreciate the utter truthfulness of that divine admonition that it is more blessed to give than to receive ; in our small but sincere giving , we have received bountifully . So we were getting along , making progress , slowly but surely going ahead . 166 And then it happened . On December 1 , which by coincidence was the one zero-temperature day of the year 1944 , The Pines burned to the ground . That morning Charlie Tipton , who took care of us , was attempting to thaw out frozen pipes , when there was an explosion in the pipeline that brought oil into the house to be generated into gas . In a moment the oil had flooded over the old Pines , which was dry and thin and excellent kindling , and the electric motor in some manner caused the oil to be ignited ; a strong wind fanned the blaze , and in forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who lived there were fortunate to escape unhurt , for none of us realized how fast the building was going . I remember that I rushed to the telephone to call for help and by the time I had finished the frenzied call the smoke was so dense that I could not see the steps . I grabbed a handful of clothes and stumbled down with them , and then I realized that Mrs. Hendricks was still in her room upstairs . We all kept yelling to her , and Charlie was on the point of attempting to get up to her at the risk of losing his own life , when she emerged through the smoke . She had managed to find her way out , she told us , by coming toward us as we shouted and screamed to her ; our frantic voices had directed her . We all spent that night and many future ones with Tony and Bonnie Ford . Bill by then was nine years old and had had a birthday only a few days before ; for his birthday present he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready for bed the little fellow brought those bills to me with his own little scrawled note : This is for Lucy and the new Pines . " Martha Ford was only three , and although she had heard 167 discussions of the fire it had meant nothing in her experience until she went with her mother for the mail on Sunday and saw the forlorn chimneys of the old Pines standing alone and bleak . She came back to the house wailing , " I did n't want the Pines to burn ! " I went out and carried her in . " We 'll build a new Pines out of stone , " I told the disconsolate little girl , " and stone wo n't burn . " And she could help build it , I assured her , by hauling stones for it in the little red wheelbarrow her daddy had made for her . After that whenever we started discussing plans for our new building , Martha would run for her little wheelbarrow , ready to go to work . It was our custom to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time we wondered what we would say about the fire . We did n't want such a letter to be a begging one , but we were sure our friends everywhere would want to know what had happened and what our greatest needs were now that the old Pines was gone . We finally compromised by deciding to add a postscript declaring that Any gifts to the new Pines can be deducted from income tax . " About that time , too , Mrs. S. T. Henry , who with her husband published our Tri-County News , telephoned and said they were making a front-page article of the fire and that if we would send down a few hundred names of those likely to be most interested , they would send papers to them . I thanked her and asked her to let us have the postage bill , and she said they would prefer doing the whole thing . They did do a very fine story about the fire and sent out copies of that issue to our friends throughout the country . And in response to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them five dollar bills , until we had received a total of 168 about $2,000 . We had insurance of $3,500 , and this with the gifts we had just received encouraged us to plan a new building . We hoped to be able to get a subfloor down and a roof in place in time for the expected summer crowd . So we set to work . We barely got the building in shape for use when the first group arrived ; in fact , it was hardly usable , but we used it nevertheless . We did have the subflooring and the roof , but there were no stone walls and no inside finish , only tar paper to keep out the weather . And the roof was n't permanent , only tar paper there too , but it served to keep out sunshine and rain . Hardly had that first group got here , though , before they pitched in to help with the new Pines project . And that year students did more toward financing our growth than had ever been done at Penland before in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . We all knew that for the first time we were to have GI Bill students and that we could not take care of them unless and until the new Pines could be made livable for winter . So students and staff put on all kinds of projects for making money . The young ones polished shoes , some taking white shoes , some brown , some black ; they charged twenty-five cents a polish and frequently they had an announcement made at the tables that shoes around Penland were looking mighty shabby . Each floor of each building would have some sort of project . I recall that one group gave a party for which admission was charged . But there was a trick to it ; you also had to pay to get out again ! Colonel Fishback , an army officer who had been wounded in the service , did his bit by writing to every company with which we dealt . In his letter to each company he told what a summer at Penland had meant to him . He declared 169 he felt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege of sharing in a most worth-while undertaking . And do you know , every company he wrote to responded with a check , some for $25 , most as much as $100 . And one day when the mail came up I heard him making a strange noise , a sort of groaning , and I went by his door to see what was the matter . There was the colonel , draped over his bureau , with a check in one hand , and he was shaking his head and moaning , " I ca n't take it , I just ca n't take it ! " He saw me then and showed me the check , and I underst000d why it had almost overcome the colonel . The check was for $500 ! But the letter with it was as inspiring as that check . It was from the president of one of the cotton mills ; he said he had known of the work at Penland for many years and that the woods up here were full of his relatives , and that he felt privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employes who had given their lives in the service of their country . That check paid for two of the larger bedrooms in the new Pines and the names of those two men are on the doors of the rooms that memorialize them . We had many auction sales . Usually the articles sold were things students and staff members had made in the shops . But sometimes they brought in things from the outside . This was the year that nylons , chewing gum , cigarettes and chocolate bars were all but unobtainable . Now and then somebody would bring some of these things in and add them to the articles being auctioned . And what prices they brought ! I remember once a Hershey bar brought $1.76 . The funds obtained in these various ways during the summer , we were happy to discover , supplemented the money we were able to 170 borrow on our collateral to the extent that we took bids on the finishing of the entire structure and went to work . In the fire , of course , all dining room and kitchen equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suggested that each who could conveniently do so bring a plate , cup , saucer , knife , fork and spoon . Every student did , and I had never enjoyed any variety of dishes more than that summer 's array . Every plate I looked at reminded me of the person who brought it , and each piece , I became firmly convinced , had personality . The building of The Pines was done during war shortages and there were complications of many kinds . One shortage was labor , and even if we 'd had money , we could have got very little domestic help . That summer we had no paid help in the kitchen and dining room except Henry the cook . Everybody waited on tables , everybody took turns washing dishes . We had a paper on the wall where people signed up for days when they 'd wash dishes . Two teachers of art in a western college wrote applying for positions as art teachers for the summer . I wrote that we taught only crafts , nothing in the fine arts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting summer and one that would be different from anything they had ever known , I could provide them jobs if they were willing to accept them . The jobs , I said , were dish-washing ; they could have them , though they carried no salaries , I wrote . I explained that when they were not over the tubs they would have their time free for doing anything in the crafts they liked , at no charge . They accepted . And as they were leaving they told me they had never had a more enjoyable summer . That was the summer that Mattie ? Mrs. B. G. Mattson of 171 Michigan ? instituted what came to be known as the " jumping " system in our dining room . In this plan one person at each table volunteers for one day a week to jump up and get what 's needed and also to remove plates and food and bring on the dessert , and afterwards to clear the table . At one table there were a college president , an M.D. who was a scientist at Oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , and a real estate man from Florida . I was somewhat embarrassed at the thought of those men jumping table ; I felt that very probably they had never done any domestic work and would be awkward and cumbersome . But the four men said to the women at their table : " You women stay seated ; we are going to take over this table . " And I would watch intrigued as they would go to the kitchen ; they would look so important , as if they had finally found out what made the wheels go round ; they had achieved , they had arrived . And when those men left , the college president and the doctor told me that they hoped that when things became normal again we 'd never go back to having waitresses . " We would never have known people as we have come to know them by rubbing elbows while doing that sort of work together , " they explained , beaming . When the doctor and his wife signed up to do their dishwashing turn , they discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They thought that she probably would rather wash dishes with the young folks and they said , " Peggy , did you know that we 're going to wash dishes the day you have signed up to wash them ? " And she said , " Yes , I know it . " Then they asked her why she had signed for the same day . " Because , " she replied , grinning , " I wanted to see Daddy washing dishes . " 172 " Miss Lucy , " this atomic scientist said to me one day , " until I came to Penland I had never found a place where I could forget my worries . " And I did n't know until that first atomic bomb went off just what he meant . I knew then that he had really had worries . The men at Oak Ridge had a serious job . It must have been a terrific mental and moral strain . Dean Knapp of the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University once told me that he had two looms in his basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door and weave . " It 's the only time , Miss Lucy , " he said , that I can forget my troubles . " That was his idea of relaxing recreation . Working with your hands has a definite therapeutic value ; in fact , that is what occupational therapy is . Professor Kessler of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois came down here with his wife one summer . He announced that he was n't going to do one thing except rest ; he was weary , worn out , he did n't want to do a thing but sit back and take it easy . Well , before they had been here long he was changing all the lights over in the weaving room of the Craft House ; he put up fluorescent lights . He went around with his little bundle of tools just having the best time , and he was busier than anybody else on the hill . When he went away , after working like a Trojan , he told us he had never before felt so rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's topflight tree pathologists here from Washington . They were not interested in crafts , but their wives were ; and their wives had persuaded them against their wishes to come here to spend their vacations . So they came down . The husbands said they would just sit 173 around and rest ; they did n't know what to do with themselves ; they had only come because their wives had insisted , and they would just sit it out . Well , they got so interested in crafts ? they were doing metal enameling , and they did some beautiful pieces that we had n't done , including transparencies such as lavalieres ? and their wives were so overcome with amazement at what their husbands were doing that they practically spent all their time watching and gloating over their husbands ' accomplishments . There was a lady from Alabama who had never worked at any crafts . She came in on a Sunday night , and she was very weary . She had with her only one large crate ; she told us she had shipped all her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it 's my sewing machine . I have never done any crafts and I just know I ca n't learn , but I know I can sew . So I brought my sewing machine . " Do you know she never unpacked that sewing machine ! She got started on crafts , and she just did everything ? working from daylight until dark , and in the evenings . She worked in a number of crafts and did them well . She just took to it naturally , and she almost worked herself to death having fun . And she took that sewing machine back to Alabama still crated . The young teacher who had to go away to summer school to get her certificate renewed is another example of how people who have had no experience in handicrafts and view such experience with skepticism often become avid crafters . This girl had sent for catalogues to several schools and she chose this one , she frankly told us , because it had the shortest course of them all ? three weeks ? and announced that the people who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was coming to do as little as she could get by with . 174 She came for the first summer session , and she stayed all through the summer . And how she did work ! She told us , laughing , that nobody could have made her work like that . We do n't give college credit here , although some colleges have required certain of their students to take courses here . But teachers have to take refresher courses in the summers , and they can take such courses at Penland . They do not get college credits , but they are credited with having done required summer work . So they come here not only to take this required refresher work but also to enjoy a constructive vacation in a beautiful locality . It 's more than a change of climate , it 's virtually a different way of life for everyone who comes . And almost without exception , I 'm confident , they love it . But I 'm about to get away from that summer when we were living in the shell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scarcer . Had it not been for this volunteer service , I do n't see how we could have operated . And we had such an enjoyable summer , too . We got along happily enough , and the dollars saved could go into the further building of the new Pines ; we were looking forward with more hope and confidence to a building completed to the extent that it could be used by the following winter . But it still lacked a lot of being completed . One industrious student was helping one day by sweeping the second floor of The Pines ; she had started at the west end and was sweeping along the hall toward the stairway , and her purpose was to sweep the accumulated dirt down the stairway and out the front door . But though she had swept dirt and swept dirt , when she got to the stairs , there was no dirt ; it had simply dropped through the cracks in the floor . Housekeeping in a shell of a house may have its advantages , after all . 175 THE ONLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pointed out , was Henry , the Negro cook . But Henry deserves more than a casual mention in any story of Penland School . Henry is himself an institution . Henry enjoyed the Penland family that summer , more particularly , I thought , because there was no partition between the kitchen and dining room , only the studding , and he could stand in the kitchen and count the number of rolls each person ate . The more each ate , the broader was the grin on Henry 's face . When we were planning the new Pines we arranged for a bedroom and bath on the sunny side of the basement . We thought Henry would like the new and comfortable quarters . But he did n't ; he wanted to continue living in the little cabin we had built in the back yard of the old Pines , which had been 176 constructed of the wrecks of all the old houses that had been on the place when I had bought that property . So we put up a sign over his door : HENRY 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosopher . He neither reads nor writes , but what has that to do with wisdom and native wit ? In the summers I always went down for an early breakfast , and while Henry did my egg , tossing it and turning it in the air for my entertainment , we philosophized on the problems of yesterday and the predictions for today . He would tell me of those who had asked him for recipes for some of his dishes , which he had given them . " But it wo n't taste like mine when they makes it , " he would say , and I have a very decided opinion that Henry was right . Sometimes I 'd ask Henry how he made some particular dish . His answer would be about like this : " Well , you takes your flour and you siftes it . " ( Henry 's sifts , like so many words in our mountain region , goes back to Chaucer 's day . ) " Yes , Henry , " I 'd say , " but how much flour ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is cookin ' for . " " Let 's say we 're cooking for six . How much would you use for six ? " " Well , that depends on just how hongry they is . So you takes jest about enough flour for six and you siftes it , and then you puts in it a little salt , and you puts in about enough baking powders to make it light . " " But how much , Henry ? " " Jest enough to go wid that much flour . " And on and on . I agree with Henry . It wo n't taste like Henry 's when I make it ? if I ever do ? from Henry 's recipe . 177 Only once , as far as I can remember , did Henry make a mistake in his cooking . Although he could n't read , he could tell by the pictures on the cans what was in them , and he arranged them on his shelves so that each thing was easy to find . It happened one day that somebody had cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ginger and the red pepper were in cans of identical size , shape and appearance , and they had swapped positions on Henry 's shelf . So the next day when Henry made gingerbread , which was one of his specialties , he used red pepper instead of ginger . I believe that Mr. Greenwall was the first to take a bite of what we supposed was gingerbread . And he took a big bite . Without saying a word , he put his hand to his mouth , reached for his water , and hastily explained that he had just thought of an excruciatingly funny story . It worked . Nobody suspected what had happened , and one by one each person in the dining room tasted that red-pepper bread , until there was not one innocent left to be watched by the knowing . Nobody that day could say that Henry 's dessert was n't so hot . And needless to say , though it was n't a culinary work of art , it was a tremendous social success . But Henry was chagrined . Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had it for supper . This time Henry made sure it was ginger he used . And it was delicious ! The year of the gasoline shortage we had had more applications for the summer session than we had ever had before . With the announcement that gasoline was being rationed , cancellations poured in until we did n't know whether we would have summer school or not . Suppose we had a full house of teachers and no students ! And Henry engaged , and everything ! 178 The time came for Henry to arrive ; and I went to Marion to meet him . Henry did n't like to ride from Marion on the bus . When we reached The Pines , Henry got out of the car , looked around at familiar sights , and observed comfortingly : Now , Miss Lucy , you ai n't got nothin ' to worry ' bout . I'se here ! " I was as nearly in a state of worriment as I would allow myself to be , and Henry 's calm words and presence were strangely helpful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , that , after all , worry was only a waste of energy and already there was more to do than I had energy for . But nevertheless I was beginning to get on edge , I suppose . Henry boosted my morale and his genial philosophy helped me carry the day . During those war years Henry was employed by the Navy to cook in one of the mess halls taken over by the Navy at the University of North Carolina . The Navy 's operations at the University were year round , and as late spring approached I wondered if they would release Henry for our summer term at Penland . I was in Chapel Hill about that time , however , and Henry assured me that , come summer , he would be in Penland . When the time came , sure enough , Henry 's wife wrote me as usual to meet Henry at Marion , and I gladly did . I asked him how he had managed to get the Navy to release him . He said that when he had told them he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been doing for years , they told him they could n't let him go . " I'se got to go , " he told them . " Miss Lucy 's runnin ' that big school up there and she jes ' ca n't run it without me ; and anyway , she come all the way down here from the mountains to ask me was I goin ' and I'se done promised her I was . " 179 " Well , " said the Navy man , if you go , you wo n't have any job when you get back . " " I knows that , " Henry replied . But I'se goin ' and I'se jes ' bein ' polite and tellin ' you beforehand . " Then the Navy man went off , Henry said , but after a while he came back . " Henry , " he said , " when you come back from the mountains in the fall , come on back here and go to work as usual . " Henry had told the man the truth , I agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run this school without Henry's. help . Henry cooks during the regular school sessions at a fraternity house in Chapel Hill , where he is quite a favorite with the members and alumni . His children are all college graduates . For years his wife cooked for Dr. Frank P. Graham and his family . Dr. Graham was then president of the university ; afterward he was United States Senator and now he is one of the American officials in the United Nations . Henry knows well and appreciates ? and is appreciated by ? many distinguished men and women . But certainly no one appreciates him more than I. 180 HANDICRAFTS , OF COURSE , make Penland , but almost without exception those interested in handicrafts are wonderful personalities . At Penland , I have made the trite observation again and again , one really does meet such interesting people ! I could name them by the dozens . There 's Ruby Burkheimer , for instance . I 'll tell about Ruby for several reasons , one of which is that she gets me back to our building problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems related to building . And Ruby , beyond being an interesting member of our Penland family , was an angel with a checkbook . The fall and winter group living at The Pines while it was being built knew what it was to go about their work to the raucous sounds of hammers and saws and to eat larger or smaller portions of sawdust with their meals . They did it 181 cheerfully , too , for people at Penland generally do not complain , and so we got through that period without losing our minds or even our hearing . And the work on the building moved along . One morning at the breakfast table I made the remark that even though the building was not yet finished , we already had applications from more people than we could care for comfortably . Ruby Burkheimer was sitting at my table , and she turned to me . " I notice there is a lot of room on the third floor , and I ca n't see why you do n't finish that for a dormitory , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rather the lack of it . I 'm sure I have borrowed the last dollar the bank will let me have on the collateral I put up , which was all my life insurance . I doubt if they 'd lend me another dollar . " Ruby said in a matter-of-fact way , " Well , if that 's your trouble , I could lend you the money . " " But , Ruby , " I protested , " I 'm personally responsible for every dollar we 've borrowed . I 've got a heavy load on my shoulders now , and I 'm getting older every year , and I do n't want another dollar 's worth of debt to worry over . " We do n't have to call it debt , " Ruby countered . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do . If you 'll find out from your contractor how much it will cost to finish the third floor , I 'll make out a check for that amount . And I 'll agree to stay at Penland until my room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was delighted , of course , and readily agreed . I made arrangements with the contractor and we finished the third floor . I would say that no one at Penland has been a more glowingly enthusiastic devotee of handicrafts than Ruby Burk-182 i heimer . She borrowed my own Bergman loom , put it up in her room and wove by day and night . She was original , daring , venturesome . Students , teachers and guests just naturally gravitated to her room , and each came away fired with new enthusiasm . Ruby wove every conceivable type of material : upholstery for chairs in my living room , suitings , dress material , stoles , special and very handsome handbags , table linens , draperies . She was one of the busiest persons on the hill . After she had been here about a year , she came to me and said , " I really must go out to Seattle to see my family . I do have one , you know . I do n't want my grandchildren to grow up without my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I 'll be gone two months ? it 's such a long trip that I 'd like to stay awhile . " So she went ? with her trunks full of treasures she had made herself . We were sitting around the fireplace one evening a month later when all of a sudden Ruby blew in , looking as though she were an adventurer back from the moon and fairly bursting with eagerness to tell of wonders she had experienced . She saw that we were astonished at her untimely reappearance . " I just could n't stay away any longer , " she hastened to explain . " I bought my plane ticket back to Asheville before even telling my children I was leaving , " she said . " I could n't run the risk of being begged off . " The visit had been delightful , though , she assured us . " But , oh , it was wonderful ! You know , I had never been anybody to my family before , except just mother . I never had an identity of my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chil-183 dren loved me , I know , but they just took me as their mother , someone they were expected to love . They are all happily married , and they do n't really need me , you see . To them I was just mother . " But now ! " Ruby beamed and her eyes showed her excitement . " Now I am somebody . I am a celebrity . I can really do something . When they saw all the things I had made , they were stunned out of their normal way of thinking about me . Why , Mother , ' they raved , did you make all these ? Did you actually make these beautiful things yourself ? ' " I 'm a personality with them now . Not just mother , but somebody . They had me get out all my things for special exhibits ; they called in their friends to see them . They introduced me to friends , clubs , art groups , and with the pride of discoverers declared , This is my mother . She did this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It was wonderful , and I loved it . I just soaked it in . But then I realized I had been there long enough , and I had to come back . " " My , Mrs. B , but it 's wonderful to have you back . We 've missed you , and we 've missed your showroom , " I told her . " Now why ca n't you just stay with us always ? " There was suddenly a faraway look in her eyes . She answered , " It would be wonderful , but I ca n't . I know now that I must do something really worth while with my crafts rather than follow them just as a hobby . Why , if I had been willing to , I could have sold everything I had with me . I know I can produce for sale , and I know that I can teach . I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do : I 'm going to stay at Penland until I have used up the money I spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deciding on just how to use best what I have learned here . " 184 A few years later Mrs. Burkheimer , a successful and recognized weaver of special textiles , was back at Penland on a visit . As we sat and reminisced , she told of the reaction of several of her friends to her years spent on that faraway mountain top down in the North Carolina Blue Ridge country . They just could n't understand why she had done it , could n't grasp it at all . " How could you stay out of things so long ? " they asked her . " What did you find down there , anyway ? " " What did I find ? " she repeated their question . " Well , I think I found ? yes , I know I found ? my soul . " Perhaps Colonel John Fishback could give a similar answer truthfully were he asked such a question . He came to us first as a student . And this is the story his occupational therapist told me . Mrs. Perry had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Army Hospital came to her one day and announced : " There 's a wounded colonel here whom I 'm working with . He 's a nice man , but he 's cranky , and I just have n't been able to interest him in a thing . I wish you would come down and see if you can do something with him . He has a young wife he 's crazy about , and if you could interest him in making something for her , I believe you might get somewhere with him . " Mrs. Perry picked up her little eight-inch Structo loom and took it to him and asked him if he would n't like to weave something ? perhaps a handbag for his wife . He took the little loom , looked it over carefully and said , " Do you mind if I take this apart ? " She told him to go ahead , and he did . He tore the loom down , put it back in perfect order , and went to work . He became so interested that she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in the North Carolina mountains where 185 I learned how to weave , " she said . " You 're doing so well that I thought maybe you might like to go to Penland for a while . " The idea intrigued him . The result was that he telephoned Penland from the hospital and applied for the summer course for himself and his wife . They came . He soon proved himself a perfectionist . In fact , he did such good work and seemed to be enjoying it so that I asked him if he would return the following summer and assist Mr. Worst and Mr. Peters as an instructor in weaving . " I appreciate the compliment , " he told me , but I 'm retiring . We 're going out to California and build a home there . " So they left Penland for California and they did build their house . They lived in it two years . Then the Colonel wrote to ask me if my offer was still good to teach at Penland ? no salary , no charge for board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would welcome them back . So they sold the California home , came east , and he has taught at Penland every summer since . At the end of each summer session when I am re-engaging our teachers for the following summer , the Colonel and I enjoy this little exchange : " Colonel , will you teach for us again next summer for the same salary you had this year ? " He would answer , " Yes . The job and the salary are quite satisfactory for another year . " Sometimes we even discuss what a ten-per-cent salary raise would mean , but we have n't yet figured out just what such a raise would mean for either of us . The Colonel 's wife Ellen works on the same salary schedule as do many persons at Penland . She serves afternoon tea to the school every day except Saturdays and Sundays when people are apt to be off on mountain trips . She arranges the social 186 calendar ? and surprisingly perhaps , the social life at Penland is no simple matter , because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so short a time . For instance , Ellen makes arrangements for such things as one real mountain trip during each three-week session , and picnics in various places in our section of the mountains . One of these picnics is likely to be at Wiseman 's View , one of the most majestic lookouts in all the Blue Ridge , from which one may see the mysterious Brown Mountain lights , a phenomenon that , despite the efforts of many persons , including government scientists , has never been satisfactorily explained . On one evening at the school there will be an auction sale , of things students and teachers have made or otherwise acquired and then donated , the funds obtained going to whatever happens to be the acute need at the time ? and there are always acute needs . On another evening we show the pictures taken on our European craft tours ; on still another day and evening we have an exhibit of the work done by the students . And throughout the sessions there are special evenings of talks or pictures given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . At least once a week , too , we have folkdancing . So social life at Penland is indisputably varied . While I 'm thinking of characters that have helped to make life interesting and colorful at Penland , I 'd do well to include Uncle Charlie . That 's what he is called by Penland folk , young and old . Mr. Charles Bennett came to us in his seventies , retired and crippled with rheumatism . He walked with a cane , or sometimes one crutch , sometimes two . But wherever Uncle Charlie happened to be , he was the life of the party . No one took his ills more lightly than he himself . He even attended our folk 187 dances and put aside his cane or crutch when a waltz came up and did at least a turn or two . Uncle Charlie took up simple jewelry making at Penland and quickly became fascinated with it . His rheumatism bothered him so that he could not sit too long on the benches in the metal shop , but he bought a few jeweler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room . From time to time he would hobble down to the metal shop and get enough instruction to carry him along awhile longer in his room . Uncle Charlie 's eyes were none too good , and so he bought himself a special lamp with a hundred-watt bulb and reflectors . We gave him a simple desk that a guest had made for our lounge , and Uncle Charlie 's room became his studio . His room was at the head of the stairs and he worked with his door open , so that people coming up the steps and along the hallway at mealtime or at the end of the day could see him at his work bench . Since Uncle Charlie was indeed a social soul , they would stop in to see what he was making , and his room quickly became one of the school 's social centers . Uncle Charlie gave away much of the jewelry he made ? as birthday presents , wedding gifts , for auctioning in behalf of any fund that was being raised , or on almost any other provocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on buying one of his productions as a special gift for a friend , he would sometimes sell , but it made him happier to give . I had been invited out to dinner one evening , and as I went through the lounge on my way out , Uncle Charlie saw me . I was wearing a dark blue dress , no jewelry , no rouge , no lipstick , no highlight of any kind . I noticed him eying me . " Wait , Miss Lucy , " he commanded , " you are not quite right . Come up to my room . " 188 We went up , and he tried one piece of jewelry after another until he found just the necklace and bracelet he thought would give an inconspicuous individual in an inconspicuous outfit the necessary fillip . It worked , too . I 'm sure I had a much better time at the party for having worn Uncle Charlie 's jewelry . It is strange what zest a little unusual jewelry can add to a dinner party , or to any other occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughtfulness I feel that Uncle Charlie goes with me . Recently my brother Rufus , Auntie Freas and I stopped in to see Uncle Charlie in his Florida home . The minute he heard our voices he boomed his welcome . We found him in a wheelchair , with a tray arrangement accommodating the equipment and materials for making jewelry . " How are you , Uncle Charlie ? " we inquired , after we had greeted him . " Pretty good ! Pretty good ! " he said cheerfully . " I ca n't get about much , but I 've got a wheelchair . I ca n't see much , but I 've got good glasses and a strong magnifying glass , and I can feel . I ca n't hear very well , but I 've got a hearing aid . " He grinned broadly . " And I can still make jewelry . I 'm not doing any big business ? I do n't have to ? but I make gifts for my friends , and that pleases them . And I sell a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what I want to do . So I 'm getting along fine . " Our visit to him was a tonic for us . He made us feel that he was sitting fairly on top of the world , radiating happiness and good will , and we left with our youth renewed and our spirits aglow . Soon afterwards we got cards from him wishing us cheer and happiness on his eightieth birthday anniversary . I have often thought , a little fearfully , I confess , of what 189 might have happened to Uncle Charlie had there been no Penland at which he could learn his hobby of jewelry making , or had he failed to find out about us . Perhaps a man of his philosophic nature would have found another way to overcome his difficulties and achieve happiness and a sense of usefulness ; but maybe he would n't have . At any rate , it makes me proud to realize that our little mountain school of handicrafts has been of much significance to quite a number of people like Uncle Charlie , and , we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VISITOR DRIVING Up our hill and rounding the curve at the Appalachian School to leave behind and below the peaceful little valley will see off in the dim blue distance the upthrust and irregular line of the Black Mountain Range . Then he will marvel at the almost perfect cone of Bailey 's Peak that stands near by , a rounded and symmetrical Fujiyama , bluish-green rather than white-capped . He will find straight ahead of him , rearing skyward , the huge mass of Art'ur 's Knob . And ringing the lower slope of the Knob and fronting the circling road , a group of buildings of varying types and sizes will reveal to him that he is almost on the campus of the Penland School of Handicrafts . Dominating these buildings will be the newest one , the Lily Loom House . I 'd like to tell about it . Since the Penland School was started , to quote a friend , " on 191 a shoestring and it frayed , " we had dreamed and hoped that someday we 'd have such a building . But how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Lily Loom House ? It happened like this : Sometime during each of the sessions of our summer school , the weaving students and instructors go down to visit the Lily Mills at Shelby , North Carolina , where we buy most of our cotton yarns used in hand-weaving . We have bought from them ever since they started manufacturing yarns for hand-weavers , and even before they began such manufacturing they had studied carefully our needs , so that over the years a feeling of mutual interests , friendliness and comradeship had grown up . It was during the summer of 1944 that Tony Ford , who had taken a group to the Lily Mills , was talking with the president of the company , Mr. Jean Schenck . " I understand that every day you folk are turning people away , " Mr. Schenck said to Tony . " Well , that 's probably true , " Tony agreed . " It would probably average out to one person turned down every day . " " I ' 11 tell you , Tony , that just wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every student you have is a potential weaver , and every weaver is a potential user of Lily yarns . We just ca n't have you turning away persons who want to learn how to weave . " " We hate to do it the worst in the world , too , Mr. Schenck , " Tony told him . " But we just ca n't take them , we do n't have the facilities . We 're terribly congested at Penland . We 've got weaving going on all over the main floor of the Craft House . The Pittsburgh room , which was originally planned for looms , is filled with them , and so is the recreation room , including 192 even the stage . The Chicago room is so crowded with looms that it is impossible for us to enjoy that room fully in its capacity as a lounge . And even the long porch is so cluttered that guests dropping in to observe have to weave their way between looms to get into and out of the building . " Mr. Schenck shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countenance serious . " Tony , " he asked , " is there anything we can do about it ? " Tony suggested that Lily Mills might like to help make possible a new building that would be used only for weaving , a yarn shop and weaving instruction . The mill president was interested . He assured Tony he would try to get up to Penland before the summer was over and discuss the problem with us . Tony came home and told me , of course , what had happened . So when the next three-week termers went down to the Lily Mills , I went along . Soon after our arrival I saw Mr. Schenck and immediately he said to me , " Miss Lucy , I understand you are interested in having us help you with a new building . " I assured him at once that he had not been misinformed . We discussed in more detail our needs and the probable costs , and in the course of the talk Tony suggested that we might call the projected structure the Lily Loom House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I thought the structure might be built for , one that would serve our needs adequately . " About twenty thousand dollars , I believe , " I told him , " would put up the kind of building we would need . " " Our company would n't consider giving that much , I 'm sure , Miss Lucy , " he replied . " We had thought of providing 193 possibly ten thousand dollars . If we should give that much , do you have any idea where you 'd get the other ten thousand ? " No , I do n't , Mr. Schenck , " I replied quite truthfully . We might go to the other cotton mills in the state and we could then name it the Carolina Loom House . But that name would n't be too good perhaps , because I believe there is a Carolina Mills Company . " Mr. Schenck agreed that name would hardly be appropriate . After a little further talk they announced that the lunch hour had arrived , and Mr. Schenck accompanied us to the community house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a delicious luncheon . When we had eaten , he asked me to return with him to the office for a further discussion . He declared he really liked the suggested name of Lily Loom House , but that he was not at all sure that his board would approve of a contribution of $20,000 . He would bring it up for their consideration , however , he promised . But before they could make any decision , he added , they would want more information about the school . They would want to know to whom it belonged , how much it was worth , the amount of its indebtedness and to whom it owed money . I promised Mr. Schenck I 'd try to get him a statement giving as accurately as I could the facts and figures he sought . At Penland we went into action to acquire this information . It proved an interesting project . We had lived through the birth pangs of the school and all its growing pains , but we had never seen a statement in black and white of the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and windows , those squares of roofing , all that donated plumbing , the value of the huge septic tank and drainage field engineered and supervised without cost by professors in our university , and countless 194 other contributions of one sort and another had never been set down and tabulated . There was real zest and excitement in finding out for ourselves all this information . The insurance company sent men to appraise our buildings , and our board members figured as best they could the value of our entire property . The more we learned about ourselves the more amazed we were . When we had done the appraising and the estimating and the figuring and the compiling , we found that on paper we looked about like this : Table We sent this report to Mr. Schenck promptly , and his company soon decided to contribute $20,000 for a new building to be called the Lily Loom House ! But Mr. Schenck made it clear to us that if they put that much money into a building they would want their architect at least to approve the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly the throes of building The Pines without benefit of architect or contractor . Hopefully and , I suspect , breathlessly , I asked Mr. Schenck : Will the architect 's fee have to come out of the twenty thousand dollars ? " 195 He looked at me a moment without saying anything , and I saw a twinkle in his eyes . Then he said , No . Miss Lucy , you are cute . " I was flattered by what he said , but I was even more thrilled , I 'm sure , at having saved the architect 's fee . This was in 1944 , as I have said , and during the war , when prices of material and labor varied and fluctuated and sometimes money and materials almost reached the vanishing point . Lily Mills advised us not to attempt building until things became more stable , so we bided our time . Finally ? it was two years later ? Mr. Schenck told us we might as well start building ; there were no indications that more favorable prices would soon prevail . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penland to look over the situation and make plans for the structure . As we awaited the coming of the architect , some of our friends offered the rather alarming suggestion that if the Lily Mills planned the building it would be a streamlined structure after the fashion of a modern cotton mill , and we knew that streamlining just would not go with rustic , natural , unsophisticated little Penland . But I had worked harmoniously with Lily Mills over the past years , and I was n't too alarmed , just enough to be careful . But with the arrival of two architects , Mr. Van Wageningen and Mr. Cothran , our fears evaporated like the mountain morning mists . They tramped over the entire property , asked detailed questions about each building and its uses , even asked about the paths and the traffic on each before deciding on a site for the new loom house . We had already picked out what we thought was the only spot for the building , but the site 196 chosen by the architects was obviously so perfect that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already asked Bascom Hoyle , our rock mason neighbor , to be here with samples of local rock , and the architects had him lay up samples of masonry for us all to choose from . So carefully was everything planned and carried out that we all felt assured of having exactly the right building in exactly the right spot for exactly the right uses . Then the architects went home to draw the plans . When those plans came , we could hardly wait to unroll and examine them . And the building was handsome , so handsome , in fact , that it frightened me . Mr. Schenck and I both asked Mr. Van Wageningen if $20,000 was enough to build such a house , and he said he would not even hazard a guess , since prices of labor and material were too unpredictable . We both urged him to give us an idea , but he refused to commit himself . But we went ahead ; we knew that Mr. Schenck and his architect knew what we were building on . We bought materials and hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by week , month by month , both in size and impressiveness , until finally it reached the roof level . Then the money ran out . We had used it all up ! I wrote Mr. Schenck and told him how we stood , and I asked him to come up , look the building over and help us make further plans . He wrote back that there was no need of his coming , that what we needed was money , and that Lily Mills was not in a position to put any more money into our building . So I up and went to Mr. Schenck in Shelby . He was friendly , reasonable and understanding , but reiterated that 197 Lily Mills could do nothing more for us financially at the time . I yearned , hoped and prayed that Lily Mills would help us finish that building . Had n't their own architects , knowing that only a certain amount was available for its construction , drawn the ambitious plans ? On the other hand , Lily Mills had already given twice the amount they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more than any other contributor had given our school . All the same , however one might figure it , there on the side of the hill was that handsome house all built up to the roof and with no protection from the weather . Unless we could get it covered it would not only be utterly useless but would quickly begin to deteriorate . I told Mr. Schenck that I had spent my Penland life borrowing for the school , that I was growing older every day but could reasonably expect to be active another ten years , and that I expected to spend those ten years paying off debts , not contracting more . I suggested that if he would promise to pay any certain amount each year until the Lily Loom House was paid for , I would go back home and arrange to borrow enough money at least to put the roof on ; I was confident I could do that much . But that did n't work , either . Mr. Schenck was n't able to make any further promises . So , baffled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraged , I went back to Penland and borrowed enough money ? $14,400 in all ! ? to finish the outside walls and put the roof on . I wondered if Mr. Schenck may have thought that we had n't managed his money well . I invited him to come up and look over the building and for his sake and ours see what he thought of the way we had spent his money . He could n't come himself at that time , but he did send Bob Forney , his 198 general manager , and the architect 's assistant . I asked them to inspect the building very carefully and let us know their opinion . I wanted them to be completely frank . They spent much of the day going over every detail of the building , and when they had finished they declared unreservedly that it was a very superior piece of rock work , and that we had got much more for the money here at Penland than we would have got in Shelby . That , at least , was comforting . But still our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hasten to point out , the Lily Mills have given us contributions amounting to close to $4,000 . These gifts have not been applied to the debt , but have been used toward completing building details , such as work around the windows and doors and under the eaves , which has kept out wind and weather and made the structure fairly comfortable for summer use . In fact , we folk at Penland have been fortunate in our friendships . We have had much encouragement and support in our efforts to preserve and extend interest in our native handicrafts . And we have been particularly fortunate in the type of students and faculty persons we have enjoyed having at Penland through the years . They have been interested , of course , in learning and in sharing the knowledge and skills they had . But they have also been interested in building the school , sometimes actually with their hands , always with their encouragement and ingenuity . And their money , too . As I have already pointed out , they have been ingenious in their methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used the Lily Loom House , for instance , it had no permanent floors and no partitions . It happened that 199 we had that year a large delegation of students from Michigan , larger than from any other state , in fact , and this group undertook to finish the entire main floor of this structure , which is the floor that houses all the looms . One of these students was Mrs. Mattson , or Mattie , as she is affectionately known at Penland . Mattie came from Michigan in 1941 as a student . She returned to do library work or fill in wherever needed . The year we were laboring to finish The Pines she had woven a skirt for one of the auction sales . She announced that if the skirt sold and anyone else should want one , she would weave it and fill the order . The skirt did sell , and Mattie began getting orders for others . She got more and more orders until she was spending practically all her time weaving skirts for Penland needs . Mattie told us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the Michigan Room in the Lily Loom House . And within a year 's time Mattie had done it ! She had woven enough skirts to pay for the materials and labor required for an oak floor in the Michigan Room . The Michigan Room ? floor , walls , ceiling , windows ? cost just about $3,000 . Windows were sold at their actual cost of thirty-five dollars each and people or groups bought them , usually in memory of some loved one or in honor of a living friend . One student even gave one in appreciation of the Penland staff , which made us all bask and purr . And within three years the Michigan Room was paid for . During the summer of 1949 a winsome , generous and gracious student gave us $1,000 . The school always has so many needs that a gift of that size offers all sorts of possibilities . We have made it a rule to try never to use gifts for the paying off of debts , for debts are not romantic , while gifts are . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 thoughts of plumbing . It seems that always at Penland plumbing has been a major problem . We had had trouble with our water supply and our sewage system ; we had not had sufficient plumbing in the Craft House . And we still lacked adequate plumbing in the Lily Loom House . We knew at once what to do with this money . Before the summer was over , we had installed two washrooms on each of two floors , the first and the third , and a drinking fountain outside the south door . And since the donor wishes to go nameless , we can put no copper plates on the door , but that does n't mean that there is no gratitude in our hearts every time we are thirsty or tired and dirty or are otherwise in need of the ministrations of plumbing , and do n't have to go to some other building to obtain it . That fall we had a couple with us from Louisville , Kentucky ? Mr. and Mrs. Philip Mulkey . After they had been here a while he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the shower baths in the two first-floor washrooms . Gleefully we said we would like very much to have it . So he gave us one . The next year students , staff , everybody worked toward getting the third floor of the Loom House finished . Lectures were being held there , and it was difficult to hear every word of the instructor when , through the cracks in the floor and because of the absence of walls , there came almost unmuffled the sounds of looms running on the floor below , people going and coming , laughter and talk . So everybody was willing enough to make things for the auction sales and then bid on them and in other ways contribute to the third floor finishing fund . Now there is a lecture room with a floor , walls , blackboard , desk , chairs ? everything a well-equipped lecture hall needs . 201 DURING THE SUMMER months when Tony Ford is at Penland he publishes The Grapevine , a daily sheet which we find at our places at the breakfast table every morning . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as is stated on the cover , is published " every now and then . " Tony 's literary efforts in the main are devoted , I would say , to reporting the sayings and doings of our Penland folk ? students , staff , teachers , visitors . And in my opinion he very accurately mirrors life at our school . The other day I was turning through back copies of Mountain Milestones and I came upon this paragraph , which is quite descriptive of us , I think : " Names make news , the reporters say , and we have found that our friends , when they think of Penland , think of people ? the folks who by their united efforts have made things 202 click and kept things rocking along .

Names , names , more names of folk having the time of their lives making things , beautiful things that a few months before they came to Penland few would have thought they could ever make , or would ever dare attempt to make .

It was that night , if memory serves , that there were auctioned some especially nice articles , among these a beautiful screen-printed lunch cloth contributed by Professor Emmy ? other original stencil designs too by Frau Emmy and daughter Nora . All through the summer various students had the urge to contribute something for sale and there were many original water colors , sketches and other art creations put on the block .. . many craft articles , gem stones , and other things less arty but of practical value ....

" 208 AS PENLAND SCHOOL grew and its purposes and program became better known among those who love the handicraft arts , it began to attract more and more students from a wider and wider area . And soon students were coming into our mountains from every part of the United States and even foreign countries . So many of these foreign students , we came to notice , were from countries of northern Europe . In Scandinavian lands and Finland the handicrafts are understood and appreciated and students from these nations not only learned from us practices employed in this country , and particularly in the southern Appalachians through the long years , but also brought us an insight , which we could never have gained so well from studying their books , into the methods by which their lands have produced some of the world 's finest handicraft products . 209 They brought us something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelling urge , to visit their countries and see at first hand their craftsmen at work . We wanted to visit craft schools , see all we could of their finished products , and get a feel of the meaning of folk arts and crafts in the lives of the people of those countries where the practice of handicrafts has never ceased to be an essential part of their everyday living . We wanted also to rub elbows with the people of those countries , to exchange ideas , to greet friends who had been to Penland and to make new friends . We knew that in doing so we would be meeting people who had interests similar to our own , and we felt that if by visiting them we could do even a little bit toward promoting friendly relations , Penland would be doing that bit toward world peace . And , I must confess , we wanted to go for the sheer joy of such a trip , with all the contacts and experiences it would bring . But again there was that little business of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of a noble and generous friend , provided the money . I went . Not once , but twice . And I traveled with few prickings of conscience , because the trips were costing the school nothing . I even salved my conscience by assuring it that I would of necessity learn things that would be helpful to Penland and perhaps make contacts that would bring other Scandinavian students and teachers into our mountains . I 'd like to recount some of the things we saw and did on the second of these trips , the more interesting one from the standpoint of crafts , I believe , and it is from that standpoint only that I feel I should describe it . Few things are more boring , I 210 think often , than a traveler 's detailed account of his trip abroad ; I shall try to avoid that . Eleven of us made this trip . We sailed April 1 , 1953 , and landed at Rotterdam . After two days in Holland we left Amsterdam on the Linjebuss for Copenhagen . The first night we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? De Zee op de Heide ? the Sea by the Moor . Soon after boarding the Linjebuss the next morning we crossed the border into Germany and by lunchtime were in Bremen , the home of the Brementown Musicians of Grimm 's Fairy Tales , my favorite when we were children . After we crossed the German-Danish border we noticed more evidences of prosperity . Germany had still not recovered from the bombings and the other ravages of war . In Denmark the farms were well tended and neat and buildings were substantial . We drove through Odense , home of Hans Christian Andersen , and I longed to linger and look , but the Linjebuss did n't pause . At seven that evening we arrived in Copenhagen at the lovely new Hotel Richmond , where I found flowers in my room and a note from Helen Roby , who had been at Penland and who soon came in herself to discuss activities planned for our three days there . She had had her dinner but sat with us and had coffee and rolls . Those rolls ! The waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twisted his hand , and left me with about eight inches . ( I 'm getting into travel details , but that roll was certainly a masterpiece of culinary handicraft ! ) At 8:45 the next morning we started for George Jensen 's shop , where Miss Roby met us . A guide showed us through the workrooms where various types of silver articles were being made by apprentices who must serve four years in that 211 capacity . In one room they were making table silver , and in the illustrated price list they gave us I noticed that each design was identified not only by a number but also by the name of the designer . In another room they were doing large pieces such as bowls , candelabra and tea services . One lady was working on a large , modern silver jug of elegant simplicity . In another part of the shop they were making jewelry and I saw what I had never happened to see before , Jensen jewelry with stone settings . We noticed that the shops , like everything else in Scandinavia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore white coveralls . As we were leaving , a cart of bottled milk was rolled by and the craftsmen had their midmorning refreshment . Miss Roby had arranged for two limousines to call for us , and we discovered that the driver of the one I was in was a Mr. Rasmussen who had lived in America fifteen years ; he was a great help to us as he explained the significance of things and places we were seeing . We were going to Elsinore and Frederiksborg Castles , and as Mr. Rasmussen drove us along what is called the Danish Riviera , we saw swans in the sound , drove through forests carpeted with blue anemones , and by castles and royal residences , finally reaching Elsinore Castle of Hamlet fame . It is a huge castle , with a spacious courtyard where Shakespeare 's Hamlet is played for a month every summer . But what caught my eye especially was the castle 's furnishings of its own era ? old carved chests and interesting crude tables made of heavy boards . Mr. Rasmussen took us to a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We served ourselves and sat at tables in front of picture windows looking out over the Katagat , and across to Sweden where we could see the summer castle of Sweden 's king . I have no idea of what all we had . As I looked at that burdened board I wondered what our cook Henry would say if he could see it . One dish that intrigued me was a large silver platter with a mound of smoked herring at one end and at the other a bowl of raw eggs in the shell , garnished with capers and set in a tray of flaky salt . Someone told me that those raw eggs smeared over some of the fish dishes made them more appetizing and tasty . I could n't say . I understood there were also smoked eels , snails and reindeer tongue , but I took only those dishes I thought I recognized . As we were driving away , Colonel Fishback was describing a very choice dish he had tried and especially enjoyed . Mr. Rasmussen told him it was eel . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I 'd known what it was , " the Colonel declared . At Frederiksborg Castle we went first into the church , where we saw carvings and paintings on pews , stalls and walls in soft blues , reds and golds ; they told us they are just as they were when the edifice was built ; they are not even washed for fear the colors might be dimmed . In the castle there is room after room of art treasures representing every period of its history , rooms furnished for every occasion and representing these different periods . We noticed particularly the upholstery done in beautiful silk damasks in golds , blues , scarlets , depending upon the color schemes of the surroundings . These must have been done , we thought , on draw looms such as they still use in all of Scandinavia . But the room I enjoyed most was a ballroom that must have been twice as large as our Craft House . The walls were liter-213 ally covered with reproductions of tapestries of ancient times . They had been woven in the Gobelin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Mrs. Sommer had done some of the weaving . She had told us what pieces she had worked on , and that if we looked closely we could find her initials . The initials of the weaver were always done in the same color as the background , but in a little different tone , so as not to be conspicuous and detract from the picture portrayed but at the same time to be legible . And by looking closely we did discover Mrs. Sommer 's initials , and it made me feel very proud that the person who had helped create these beautiful Gobelin tapestries had also taught weaving at our own little Penland . As we drove back to Copenhagen we saw two interesting examples of handicraft , though not exactly of the type we do at Penland . The first was a stork 's nest atop a house . A wagon wheel had been braced to the roof as a foundation and on it the stork had built a nest of huge twigs . The storks , said Mr. Rasmussen , spend their winters in Egypt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to get this nest in readiness for his wife 's return , Mr. Rasmussen explained , but Mr. Stork was not at home when we went by his house . The other work of art in construction was a church built as a memorial to Bishop Grundvig , who founded the Danish Folk School movement . The architecture is unique , and the view of it from the front makes one think immediately of a huge pipe organ . Inside and out , the church is constructed of cream-colored brick . No other color is seen and the impression is one of magnificent simplicity . The windows are small leaded panes of clear glass . There are no decorations . The baptismal font is a huge fluted bowl of handwrought brass , set in concrete . Eight masons built the church in twenty years , and 214 when they finished , they were knighted . They deserved the honor ; they were truly craftsmen . As I stood and looked in awe at that masterpiece of the mason 's art , I wished that Bascom Hoyle , our Penland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure Bascom of Penland would have felt an affinity with those master craftsmen who had lifted toward the heavens that soundless symphony in enduring brick . The next day we spent shopping and looking . Of all the cities visited , we would agree at the end of our trip , Copenhagen was our favorite . Every store we entered might have been an art gallery . First we went to the display rooms of the Royal Copenhagen ware and bought for ourselves and our friends . Most of my purchases were of tableware in the Danish Blue Flower pattern , for though I strolled leisurely through the various display rooms , I would always end up before the displays of that pattern . The white of the porcelain seemed a little more than white and the blue just the blue that I like most . No matter how many pieces I would compare , I would find the blue flowers on no two pieces exactly alike ; that meant that each flower had been put on by an artist , free hand . So each piece had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wearing or owning handicrafts . We went next to my favorite store of all , Ilium Bolighus . Each room was an excellent example of what can be accomplished when the artist , the craftsman and the manufacturer work together . One room was simply but beautifully appointed as a dining room , with the table ready for guests . The silver , china , place mats , draperies and upholstery were all designed to be used together . Yet there was no feeling of sameness but rather one of harmony and fitness . We were particularly impressed with all the house furnish-215 ings . The woodwork was simple , modern , beautifully designed and executed . Much of the furniture appeared to be upholstered in hand-woven material , but actually it had been done first by the artist and craftsman and then reproduced by the factories . Much of the drapery material was silk-screen print , really done by hand , and later we saw this being done . In one room there was nothing but silk-screen prints , and they so fascinated me that I could hardly take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own at least a yard of each design . And I did get a meter or more of several of the prints to take back to Penland for our permanent exhibit . One day we went out to the suburban town of Holte to see two of the most expert designers and weavers of damask , John and Kristin Becker , who used hand Jacquard and draw looms . They had a small studio next to their own home , which was itself a veritable gem . Everything in it seemed to have been made by their own loving hands , and each detail was in harmony with the others , and with themselves . In the studio , just as interesting , people were weaving damasks for sale . The looms themselves were so intriguing that we almost had to drag Colonel Fishback away . One weaver was doing a Christmas table set that the Beckers had designed ; it was very much like one they use on their own table at Christmastime . It was in a bright Scandinavian red with bands of figures woven in white , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels and animals . We bought a set of these table linens for our Penland exhibit . Someday we hope to have those delightful Beckers come to visit us . That afternoon we visited Holga Foght , the silk-screen 216 artist I had met through Mrs. Emmy Sommer when our Penland group was over on the first trip four years before . She most graciously explained her methods , showed us examples of her designs and workmanship , and demonstrated printing on long tables . In all of Scandinavia and Finland , in fact , we saw a great deal of very original and exceedingly beautiful silk-screen printing , much of it in use in upholstery , draperies , table linens and wearing apparel . It was seen in both hotels and private homes . We were interested to learn about their methods of mass production . They used one , two or three tables the length of a whole building , and in some instances rollers and gauges for moving and placing the screens ; thus the printing was done by hand , with no machinery . Between visiting craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor where there were benches in the sun . We sat and visited and I feasted my eyes on one of my favorite scenes in all Denmark , the little bronze mermaid seated on a giant boulder and looking out to sea as she awaits the return of her human lover . An extraordinarily handsome piece of handicraft in fine art ! Then we walked back past the Gefion fountain , mighty and impressive , the legend fashioned in bronze of the goddess Gefion , who was told that she might have as much of Sweden as she could plow around in one day . So she turned her four sons into oxen and urged and goaded them until they had plowed around all of what is now Zealand , Denmark 's largest island , on which Copenhagen is situated . The fountain 's waters gush from the nostrils of the straining oxen laboring under the lash of their goddess mother . It is indeed a masterpiece , but I prefer the gentle little mermaid . 217 We would have enjoyed stopping the next day at Goteborg to study crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the time , and we went on to Stockholm , where we were put up at the Hotel Malmen , the last word in modern architecture and furnishings . We saw with delight that the handwork used throughout the hotel fitted perfectly into the ultramodern setting . The screen between the main dining room and the breakfast room was a grill of hand-carved figures , including a strange but artistically interesting combination of fishes and violins and what must have been elongated pineapples or pineappled tenpins . But what really caught my enthusiastic attention was a huge cock on one breakfast room wall most intricately and artistically done in small pieces of cloth appliqued on a beige background . The predominating colors were reds shading into orange , and black . He was a rather modernistic cock in his lines , too , as well as his colors ; he was n't the sort we see running about the grounds at Penland , but I 'd dearly delight to have one like him on one of our walls . Our bedrooms had simple maple furniture . There were hand-woven rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk-screen prints carrying out the same motif as the rugs and bedspreads . This was not an expensive hotel , but it was filled with handicraft products . We were impressed with the fact that those people live with their crafts . In America it is something extra , something we as a nation have forgotten and are now reviving as a hobby or as occupational therapy , not as an essential part of everyday living . A modern hotel in our country would bear all the earmarks of the latest and most scientific mass production . There might be an original painting on the wall , but most likely it would 218 be a clever reproduction . It might be a scene we could enjoy , or it could well be an abstraction to baffle our imagination or threaten our sanity . Anyway , I liked that rooster and his glowing cheerfulness , and I liked the idea that a great deal of thought had gone into the planning and making of him , and that even some big commercial architect had shared in the creative joy of designing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living personality for us . I wonder why we ca n't have more of this sort of creativity in America . 219 WE WENT DOWN the gangplank at Turku , Finland , and into the customs , where an attractive gentleman in an officer 's coat came immediately to us and asked if we were the handicraft party from America . He was from the Tourist Bureau and at once he introduced us to a delegation of a dozen or more educators of Finland , most of whom could not speak English but each of whom said to us very plainly : Well come to Finland . " I thought how much warmer a sound it had than our " welcome . They pinned a bouquet of wild anemones on each of us . As we walked through customs talking and answering questions , a reporter was trying to get in her questions , too , and as we got to the exit door a photographer took a picture of the group , which appeared the next day on the front page of the Finnish newspaper . Our baggage was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
