CONTROLS Needed : A Free Market When the U.S. Army tried to buy 13 million Ibs. of beef last week , all major U.S. packers refused the business . Only two small companies submitted bids-for a mere 190,000 Ibs . With soldiers ' meat rations running low , the Army announced that it would try to find the beef overseas . <P> Many a Fair Dealer jumped to the conclusion that the meat industry was putting profits before patriotism . But in Chicago , the A.F.L. Meat Cutters ' union put the blame squarely on price controls . The union made it clear that the packers could not sell the beef because they could not buy it on the hoof without losing money . " It is better to scrap all meat controls , " warned the union , " than to precipitate a meat shortage , black markets and industry unemployment . " <P> Many a U.S. retailer , also short of meat , is ready to dump controls . Black markets are thriving as " independent " packers roam the cattle country , buying above ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packers have closed or are about to . <P> Wilson &; Co. announced last fortnight that it will shut down its slaughtering plants one week every month ( the union calls such partial closings " black weeks " ) . In Cleveland , the Koblenzer packing house has closed . Said its president : " Last month we killed 740 cattle and lost $6,700 . They 've taken my surplus , but they are n't going to get my capital . I 'll sit till hell freezes over . " Meat controls had created such a mess that even top Office of Price Stabilization officials were talking last week of abandoning them . <P> Steaks on the Hoof . The paradox is that the U.S. is short of meat when it has more beef on the hoof than ever before in its history . By year 's end , there will be an estimated 90 million cattle on the ranges v. 1945 's alltime peak of 85,573,000 . Yet , because of OPS snarls , 10% fewer cattle are now being slaughtered than last year . And despite record meat prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 of sales , can hardly break even ( Armour lost $1,600,000 in its latest quarter ) . <P> The main trouble is that OPS has put ceilings on every form of beef except the live animals . Since there is no way to set such a ceiling ( it is impossible to grade beef before slaughter ) , livestock prices have gone right on climbing . <P> Ease &; Squeeze . Last week OPS tried to ease the squeeze on Ib. wholesale boost . At the news , livestock prices rose enough to cancel out the gain . <P> Few in the industry had ever thought controls would work without rationing . Now , since meat prices have been going up under OPS while many other prices have been stationary or dropping , everyone from cattleman to retailer thought it was time to dump controls-and get the vast supply of meat on the range to market .
