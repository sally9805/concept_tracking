Midway Island is the happy home of 645,000 albatrosses-about 35% of the world population of the Laysan species and 16% of the black-footed species . Difficulty is , Midway is also the home of a major air facility of the U.S. Navy , and the place is not big enough for both bird and plane . Last week the U.S. Navy decided that the troublesome albatross must go . <P> The great birds ( wingspan : about 7 ft. ) go through such distressingly gooney antics that Navymen long ago dubbed them gooney birds . Among other things , they need large , clear areas to take off and land , and they find airports ideal . The friendly gooney birds lay their big eggs on or near the runways , rise in clouds as if to welcome planes on landing or to see them off on takeoffs . Often they fly smack into an airborne craft . They have dived into propellers , smashed against expensive radomes , causing about $300,000 damage a year . Far worse is the ever-present danger that a Midway albatross may someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The Navy has tried to shoo the gooneys away . Sailormen have attempted to drive them out by burning old tires , scare them put by dropping flares on them and shooting off rifles , bazookas and mortars near them . When the gooneys stoically ignored it all , the Navy people called upon the scientists . The scientists tried filching the gooneys ' eggs . The birds wailed like banshees at the egg snatchers , then promptly laid some more . In desperation , the Navy packed some gooneys into planes , hauled them to far-off Guam , to Kwajalein , to northern Japan , even to Puget Sound-4,000 miles away . Unerringly , the gooneys , thoughtfully marked with a shocking-pink head dye for identincation , flew back to Midway . And the Navy learned that nothing smells up a plane more pungently than a load of airsick gooneys . <P> The Navy 's latest proposed stratagem is simple : a bash on the head for every gooney . But chances are this plan will never really get off the ground . First of all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds : young gooneys leave Midway shortly after birth to wander , return only at the age of five . Furthermore , back in the U.S. , outraged conservationists have organized a concerted protest to Congress against the projected slaughter . <P> In an attempt to soothe man and bird alike , the Navy is creating an airport for albatrosses on the nearby , nonstrategic island of Kure , hopes to build up the small albatross population there ( current count : 700 ) . Fortnight ago Navy bulldozers cut a series of 50-ft. swaths through the brush to make special gooney runways . But last week , at the peak of their mating season , the gooneys again defied the U.S. Navy . As ornithologists had predicted , not one winged off to the new , man-made sanctuary .
