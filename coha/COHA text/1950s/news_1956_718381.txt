txt Envoys from nations of the North Atlantic pact and Israel walked out of a reception here for the second time in twentyfour hours , because of a speech by Nikita S. Khrushchev , Soviet Communist leader . The reason for the walkout was remarks by the party secretary that , among other things , charged the British , French and Israelis with having " cut the throats of the Egyptians " while pretending that their attack on Egypt was a police action aimed at restoring order . As a sign of respect for the Poles , at whose embassy the reception was being held , the Western and Israeli envoys did not leave the building , but merely moved into another room , where Mr. Khruschev 's voice was inaudible . The Soviet leader was scornful about the origin of the attack on Egypt . In his mention of the contention by the British and French that they had gone into Egypt to restore order , he said : " What kind of order is this ? It is the order of colonizers , the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Khrushchev apologized to Wladyslaw Gomulka , Polish Communist leader , for " making such a speech on the territory of a foreign state . " The reception marked the conclusion of a new Polish-Soviet Government and party accord . The Western powers are trying to " defame " President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt , Mr. Khrushchev said , adding : " Actually Nasser is not a Communist and politically he is closer to those waging war on him . " Nasser Is Chided " He has even put Communists ' in jail , " he continued , in what is nowadays unusual Soviet criti-1 cism of the Egyptian leader . " He had to , " said Marshal Kliment Y. Voroshilov , in an apparent allusion ? to the Soviet contention that Egypt had been dominated by the anti-Communist Western powers until recently . " Do n't try to help me , " Mr. Khrushchev admonished the elderly chief of the Soviet state , and continued : " But Nasser is fighting for national independence , he is the hero of his nation and our sympathies are ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scathing sallies for Israel , which " carries no weight in the world and if it plays any role it is to start a fight . " The Soviet Union protested to Israel " just for form , " he said , at the time it called on Britain and France to halt the war in Egypt . Without British-French backing , Mr. Khrushchev continued , Israel would have had her " ea , rs boxed " by the Arabs and peace would have been preserved . Mr. Khrushchev promised that the Soviet Union would seek a Middle East settlement because it realized the situ : . tion in Egypt was serious and " the fire must be put out . " Withdrawal Urged He predicted Britain and France would be " wise enough " to withdraw their troops from the Suez Canal . zone and Egypt would emerge stronger than ever . He ignored Moscow 's threat to send " volunteers " to help the Egyptians , - Mr. Khrushchev 's estimate of the outlook was considerably more conciliatory and optimistic than anything heard here in recent days . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We must seek a settlement so coexistence can be peaceful and advantageous . " Admitting the seriousness of the crisis he said the Soviet leaders were " realists " and would not seek to exploit it for their own purposes . He said the nevi Soviet disarmament proposals attested to Moscow 's desire for peace . The Soviet press reported this morning that Egypt had not requested Chinese Communist " volunteers " because of her " belief " that the United Nations resolutions on the withdrawal of troops would be carried out . Mistakes Conceded MOSCOW , Nov , 18 ( W ) ? Mr. Khrushchev told the Western envoys at the Polish Embassy tonight : " If you do n't like us , do n't accept our invitations and do n't invite us to come to see you . " The Soviet Communist party chief said many mistakes had been made in building socialism in the Soviet Union because of the lack of examples and the lack of personnel .
