Scarcely had the rodeo roughnecks wahooed out of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden when the gentlefolk of horsedom cantered in . Unmannerly broncos and bucking Brahman bulls were replaced by mannerly hunters and harness ponies , five-gaited mares that would no more buck than fly . The crowd was different too : vulgar cheers were taboo ; from the Golden Oval of boxes came only polite applause , an occasional bravo that rang no rafters . With its black toppers , red tail coats and trumpets signaling the start of Manhattan 's social season , last week the 63rd National Horse Show was in full swing . <P> The international competition was the keenest ever , the revived U.S. team facing the top equestrian talent of Brazil , Mexico , Ireland and Canada . Appropriately , Colonel Humberto Mariles , captain of the Mexican Army team , rode off with the show 's first big award , the President of Mexico Trophy , for traversing a 13-jump course on three successive mounts . <P> A minor international incident flared up when Mariles protested to the judges because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing flag in winning the West Point Challenge Trophy . But when the Show 's president , Brigadier General Alfred G. Tuckerman , proved that the flag was no course marker , Mariles ended by complimenting Tubridy for smart riding . <P> The U.S. equestrian team , now one &; the same as the U.S. Olympic team , produced an added attraction : Mrs. Carol Durand , 33 , the wife of a Kansas City insurance executive , and the first woman ever chosen as a U.S. Olympic team member . This week , against the world 's best riders , Mrs. Durand got her third white ribbon ( fourth place ) in the International Jumping Stake . <P> But the hit of the individual entrants was Mrs. Loula Long Combs , 70 , who has taken blue ribbons at every one of her National showings since her first in 1913 . Rounding the show ring in her red-wheeled phaeton , with her smartly liveried footman sitting behind her on the dickey and her docked , high-stepping horses trotting in perfect rhythm , she took the harness pairs class , celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hackney horse and pony classes . <P> Back home at Longview Farm in Lee 's Summit , Mo. , Horsewoman Combs spends much of her time in her stable , spoiling her horses and making pets of them . A devout member of the Disciples of Christ ( she has her own chapel at Longview as well as a half-mile training track ) , she refuses to compete in a horse event on Sunday . At the National last week , Loula Combs was getting a special dispensation to befit her royal station : " The Garden has been so nice . They have n't scheduled any event of my class on Sunday , so I wo n't miss anything . "
