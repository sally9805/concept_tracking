Telephone switchboards at Cleveland newspapers and radio stations lit up like Christmas trees last week . The town 's baseball fans had just heard that the Indians were sacking popular Manager Lou Boudreau , and the fans were grabbing telephones to register their wrath . Three years ago , in the regime of Owner Bill Veeck , the club had talked about trading Manager Lou , but backed down when the customers raised the roof . This time there was not much advance warning : Boudreau himself was " shocked . " <P> General Manager Hank Greenberg , a good country slugger in his day but not yet a good public-relations man , tried to pour soothing oil on the fans ' hurt , but nearly drowned himself in it . After acknowledging that Boudreau was " probably the most popular player in Cleveland history , " Greenberg bubbled on that , in sacking him , the new management was just trying to " do what was right for the fans . " Boudreau fans considered that Greenberg had done them dirt . <P> Lou Boudreau had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shortstop in 1939 . In 1942 he became the " boy wonder " manager ( at 24 ) . Lacking speed afoot ( his nickname is " Old Shufflefoot " ) , Lou made up for his slowness by getting a fast jump on the ball and by developing an almost uncanny knack of knowing where opposing batters were most likely to hit . <P> Handsome Lou , idol of Cleveland 's bobby-soxers as well as its knowledgeable fans , had his biggest year in 1948 , right after Bill Veeck tried to fire him . Batting a splendid .355 and driving in 106 runs , Lou led his Indians to their first pennant in 28 years and a world championship over the Boston Braves . <P> Last year Lou slowed down at the plate , benched himself half the season in favor of agile young Shortstop Ray Boone . The Indians , a red-hot pennant contender in August , cooled down in the September stretch while Manager Lou , always at his best as a field leader , sat on the bench nursing a sickly .269 batting average and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new manager : 42-year-old Al Lopez , once ( 1947 ) a second-string catcher for Boudreau , since then a highly successful manager for the Indianapolis Indians . At week 's end , Lou Boudreau seemed to have no idea where he 'd be next year .  --  - <P> While Boudreau was left to his wondering , another baseball headliner settled down with a long contract . At 69 , onetime Dodger General Manager Branch Rickey signed a five-year contract ( with an option for a five-year renewal ) as general manager of the hapless ( last place ) but profitable ( second in league attendance ) Pittsburgh Pirates .
