Just before South Viet Nam 's doughty President Ngo Dinh Diem set off last week on a four-day state visit to neighboring Thailand , he was tactially informed that his favorite white sharkskin suit would not be proper at the Royal Thai court . He dispatched an aide on an emergency trip to Hong Kong , but when Diem took one look at the Western-style cutaway , striped pants and grey top hat that the aide brought back , he snorted in disgust and refused to wear them . <P> Next day when Diem 's C-47 touched down at Bangkok 's spick-and-span military airport , the President disembarked to review the waiting honor guard , clad instead in his national Vietnamese dress : blue silk mandarin gown and black Tonkinese turban . The mandarin gown reflected more than a mere impulsive presidential whim : it symbolized a complicated and many-faceted change that has come about in President Diem 's political thinking in recent months . <P> Asia for Asians . Put simply , Diem is still taking U.S. money by the millions ( $197 million last year ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this was a decision not even to use the phrase " antiCommunism " in any speeches in Thailand . Diem remains a Roman Catholic and a staunch antiCommunist , but he has become convinced that Communism is best fought in Asian terms , and from a non-Western base . The next stop , as Diem sees it ( and as he hopes to convince other Southeast Asian leaders ) , is the creation of such a base through a revival and reappraisal of Asian culture and Asian values . <P> On the practical political side , Diem believes that this goal can be best attained through bilateral defense pacts and cultural exchanges with his Southeast Asia neighbors . He wants to keep the shield of Western political protection , e.g. , SEATO , U.S. military training missions , but believes they should be de-emphasized as much as possible in the public mind . <P> In Bangkok last week , there was a good chance that this kind of appeal might fall on receptive ears . In Thailand , as in the neighboring kingdom of Cambodia and to a lesser extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neutralism and anti-Americanism have shown a marked and steady increase during the past 18 months . Bangkok diplomats just smiled when Thai Premier Pibulsonggram , one of the shrewdest politicians in Southeast Asia , observed blandly of Diem 's visit : " Politics wo n't be discussed . This is a state visit . " The fact is that , though Pibulsonggram 's public statements are often almost embarrassingly pro-American , he and two of his closest political cronies either own or control 13 of the most violently anti-American newspapers in Thailand . Sample recent headlines : <P> <P> AMERICA DESTROYS THAILAND . AMERICANS LORD IT OVER THAIS . YANKEE CREATES DISORDER . <P> <P> Something Like Nehru . There is a world of difference between the two leaders . The Thai Premier runs a sometimes benign , sometimes malevolent dictatorship whose inner-circle corruption is legendary even in an area where corruption is taken as a matter of course . President Diem 's own South Viet Nam regime has its share of corruption , and Diem has autocratic inclinations , but he is personally austere and moralistic .
