For all my troubles , I blame two governors of New York State , Herbert H. Lehman and Averell Harriman. both Democrats  --  not to overlook two Republican legislatures whose members cheerfully collaborated with them , I blame Lehman for accepting , with alacrity , my suggestion that the state build itself a fancy ski arca on Whiteface Mountain , in the Adirondacks , some 500 miles north of New York City . I blame Harriman for working hand in glove with a joint legislative committee . nineteen years later , to make this wild dream conic true . Between them , the two administrations have lowered my earning capacity , driven my wife to distraction , kept me oscillating between euphoria and despondency , and cost me sums of money I could ill afford . They have also convinced me that skiing must possess some secret charm . elf why would I punish myself this way ? I doubt if Herbert Lehman knew one end of a ski from the other . He was , nevertheless , willing to concede that some of his constituents might derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair suspended from a moving cable in order to go tearing down to the bottom again on a pair of skis . Lehman was a tolerant man . He must have been , or he never would have listened to me , a private citizen , with no ( Continued on Page 110 ) official hacking , who had come up with the strangest idea of the year 193a . Averell Harriman , on the other hand , should know better . He is a skier himself , who still t. : : 11-VCS. neat 111111S in the snow at the age of sixty-six . Such is the strange power of the sport that it has even led Republicans and Democrats , though normally mortal enemies in New York State , to lie down together in the mariner of the lion and the lamb . The Republican majority in the 1957 legislature included the Whiteface Mountain project in its program of " must " bills , to be passed at all cost . A loan of 52,500,000 was authorized , to be repaid from a subsequent bond issue . This method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislative Committee on Winter Tourists , an energetic young assemblyman from the north-country city of Malone , New York , named Robert G. Main . With funds in hand . Harriman is now finishing what Lehman started , observing with some mirth that ski centers are cheaper to build than insane asylums , and accommodate substantially the same category of citizen . This witticism embodies a germ of truth , Skiers may seem normal when dressed in city clothes . But in their heart of hearts , all are monomaniacs who talk little but skiing , and talk most when the weather is hottest . According to the best estimates , some 5,000,000 Americans fall into this category . To satisfy their tastes , there now are 230 ski lifts in the United States . A visit to any winter resort between Vermont and the Sierra Nevada will confirm that skiing is a highly contagious diserisa . It was not so contagious in 1938 , when I first came up with the idea of a mammoth ski-lift center on the eastern slopes of Whiteface Mountain . In those days , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idaho . This project , by the way , was dreamed up by Harriman in 1935 , when he was chairman of the board of the Union Pacific Railroad . His European travels already had sold him on skiing as a sport , and the idea of a ski center somewhere along his railroad struck him as a good advertising gimmick . He suffered plenty of headaches before Sun Valley became a success , so 1 suppose it is only fair to saddle him with a new one . Building a ski center as elaborate as Whiteface calls for an endless number of decisions , any one of which may turn out to be wrong . The state opened two huge chair lifts and a network of trails early this winter . A second phase of development is to be finished by 1959 , including another big lift . Because Whiteface will cost 52.500,000 , it behooves everyone concerned to spend the money carefully in order to produce one of the finest ski areas east of the Rockies . That includes me , for I am now chairman of an advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harriman 's direction , and in addition a Republican member of the Whiteface Mountain Authority , which built and operates the new ski center . By the time everything is completed , I shall be fifty-one years old and feeling eighty years old . I think I will just sit by the fire and look out the window as the governor comes skiing past . The odd thing about my personal connection with skiing is that it started on the borax slide , in R. H. Macy 's New York store , in 1933 . As a youngster . I had puttered around on skis in my home town , Little Falls , Minnesota . It was n't a sport I found particularly entrancing. probably would be cheerfully ignorant , and infinitely less harassed , if I had n't wandered into Macy 's to see what this new device might be like , The borax slide was an inclined and gently sloping trestle , carpeted with velvet and thickly covered with borax , for easier sliding , It was possible to travel downhill on skis for about twenty feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside , a clever device conceived by a ski teacher named Sig Buchmayr to encourage the sale of ski equipment . Since my childhood , however , something new had been added . We used to ski with toe straps , into which the front of the boot was firmly jammed . Because there was nothing to hold the heel in place , it was impossible to go in any direction but straight down . Those essaying the borax slide were fitted with ski boots and with bindings which held the foot firmly . It was possible to turn or to slow down without parting company with the skis . One trip down the borax slide , and I was trapped . My subsequent addiction to skiing , if you want to call it that , has taken me into some much more scary places . I have gone skiing in summer in the Canadian Rockies where from time to time you must leap a yawning crevasse , or else tumble 150 feet into an icy chasm . I have watched avalanches roar down , ripping tons of snow and rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the debris . I have kited down a mountainside in Italy on skis , with a half dozen German mountain troopers in pursuit . I have passed the examination for professional ski teachers , which was the most unnerving experience of all ; and , during the war , I served with a detachment of the only ski-and-mountain division in the United States Army . Except in springtime and in certain mountain ranges where the temperature rarely drops to zero , to ski is to undergo an ordeal by freezing . You congeal while riding up the ski lift , which generally is an endless chain of chairs suspended at about the level of the treetops . You complete the freezing process while skiing down again . If you are a weekend skier in THE the East . as I generally am , you will arrive in the Adirondacks , the Green Mountains or the White Mountains to tind either ( a ) powder snow , ( b ) glare ice , ( e ) stumps and rocks or ( d ) green grass . If you ski in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avalanche danger , or else it will be snowing so hard that you need a Seeing Eye dog to guide you down the slopes . There is even the admittedly extreme example of what happened at Mt . Hood , Oregon , a few years ago : So much snow fell that the chair lift was buried all winter . Roland Palmedo , a New York sportsman , who developed the immensely successful ski centers at Mt . Mansfield and Mad River Glen . Vermont , sums it up with a Latin paraphrase , " De . ckiihns non est dispolandum . " Freely translated , this means , " There is no point in arguing why people ski . " The original proverb remarked that there was no point in arguing about tastes , which comes down to the same thing . To illustrate , I have friends in Dallas , Texas . Most people would consider them lucky , for they live where it rarely snows . Where do they spend their Christmas holidays ? Skiing at Aspen , Colorado . I have acquaintances in Honolulu . the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade winds . Where do they spend their February weekends ? When possible , skiing on the topmost slopes of the volcanoes , which attract an occasional snowstorm . This leads to another sage observation : " Skiing is not a sport . It is a way of life . " The comment was made by Otto Schniebs formerly coach of the Dartmouth College ski team , more than anyone else responsible for the skiing boom in this country , which began about 1933 . Otto , having gone on to coach at St. Lawrence University , in upstate New York , is just now retiring at age sixty-five to do some skiing on his own , and betimes , to run a ski shop at Whiteface , To judge from other evidence , he is likely to keep going for quite a while . Herman Smith-Johanssen , a wonderful old Canadian , is still sliding around the Laurentian Mountains at the age of eightyone.When he was a little spryer , at about age sixty , he used to undertake somewhat longer trips . Every now and then , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 1 , the 5344-foot summit of Mt . Marcy , the highest mountain in New York State . This trip involved sixteen miles one way , and 3500 vertical feet of climbing . He would start at dawn , and he would be back before darkness , accompanied by an Eskimo dog that carried his master 's luncheon and extra clothing in a pack saddle attached to his back . I never expect to match Smith-Johans. sea 's record , but at the age of forty-one I came fairly close . My trip extended over twenty-two miles of mountainside and rolling hills in the heart of the Canadian Rockies , near Banff . After I got to my destination , Mt . Assiniboine Lodge . I had to spend un hour stretching my leg muscles before i could sit down . Otherwise , I might have frozen permanently in the bent-kneed position assumed on the trail by all efficient skiers . Bent knees act as a shock ' absorber and give the skier flexibility in varying terrain , but they are not comfortable out of hours . When I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party from midnight to noon to make its way back to civiliza ? tion . We had to descend into a sheer canyon and then climb out the other side . I spent most of the night taking of my skis and carrying them over avalanche debris . From lime to time I could look up and see potential avalanches hanging from the cliffs , ready to let go . We were traveling at night because the colder temperatures keep the snow from sliding  --  generally . Along the way , we met a grizzly bear which had wakened from hibernation a little early . I simply stared him down . and he lumbered off into the forests . After the trip we had made , a grizzly was only a minor nuisance . Thinking back on that excursion , I had rather deal with a whole platoon of grizzlies than with an equal number of politicians , where skiing is concerned . Every time this Whiteface Mountain business has revived , it has been necessary for its friends to steer it through the New York State Legislature , a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mountain , there are always wild cries from other areas : " What about something for us ? " Sometimes , these requests are valid . My advisory committee is considering other mountains in the Adirondacks and Catskills that deserve to be developed . But a good many times , it is simply the old pork-barrel business all over again . The elected representatives of the people are both conscientious and honest ; they also have to be re-elected . Trying to keep their constituents happy and getting the desirable projects approved , in the face of pressures from home , is not one of the joyful phases of skiing . The Whiteface Mountain project , on a mountain rising to 4872 feet above sea level , came about because Franklin D. Roosevelt , when governor , built a highway to a point near the top . This involved an amendment to the state constitution . State-owned lands in the Adirondacks are governed by a stipulation that " the lands of the state shall remain forever wild . " It struck me , as a skier , that no mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have made a more fatal error . When 1 proposed a new constitutional amendment in 1938 to permit the construction of a ski center on Whiteface , the conservationists of New York State rose up like maddened hornets . About half a dozen of us , including that devoted skier . Lowell Thomas , managed the campaign for the amendment  --  which involved convincing a dubious legislature that the word " skiing " belonged in the constitution . Somehow , in accordance with law , we managed to get the bill passed ( Continued on Page .112 ) by two I 1 a Continued 1 Page 11th successively elected legislatures . It then came up for sour Its the people in November , 1941 . I lost a good mans friends while that battle m as under way , es en though I agree in general that the Adirondacks ought to remain " forever They have remained by and large , since the stale took control of the area and established the Adirondack Park in 1892 . In addition to losing friends during this time , I also nearly lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing a %en momentous matter , did not get around to counting the soles on the amendment until three dos later , during which time I sun mctl on cigarettes and black coffee . When the totals were in , though 1.471,068 citu'ens had stated , me won by just 9934 votes . As it developed . we need n't haste gotten so excited . Pearl Harbor came along just one month later , and work on Whiteface Mountain was suspended until the end of the war . I suppose it is only fair , at this point , to include Thomas E. Dewey among the goscmors who has e brought trouble into my life . Dewey was an excellent gcnernor , who knew nothing about skiing and had no reason to be concerned with it . lie was , howeser , surrounded by people who thought they knew a lot . Our careful plans for a ski center , in an area of prosen snow , on the east side of Whiteface Mountain , were discarded . Instead , an entirely new area was proposed  --  on a rocky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain . Once a governmental agency gets going , nothing can stop it . By the winter of 1948 there was an 5850,000 ski center on the northern end of Whiteface Mountain . It had a nice ski lift , a 5250,000 palace for a ski lodge , and a network of trails  --  in fact , esenthing but snow . Behind every storm came a roaring wind , w hich swept all the snow off the trails and into the woods . It was so bad that a visit by Dewey , to dedicate the establishment , had to be postponed three times , and finally was put off until the following winter . As of 1949 , my dream for Whiteface Mountain was tucked away in a bureau drawer and gathenng dust . Meanwhile , every winter , the eastern side of the mountain was deep in snow , sheltered from wind and in escry respect still a good skiing bet . What resised it was , initially , a sum by Harriman in March , 1955 . At his direction , an experimental ski trail ryas cleared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1955-56 , this trail registered phenomenal snow depths . Next , a legislative committee chaired by Assemblyman Main , with Senator Robert McEwen as vice chairman , began to cast around for ways to bring more tourists to upstate New York in winter . In February , 1957 , the committee introduced a bill to provide 52,500.000 for Whiteface , and Harriman signed it on April eleventh . Meanwhile , the engineers of the state Department of Public Works were running up and down the cast side , surveying routes for access roads . parking areas , warming shelters and ski lifts . Icould remark smugly that a good idea always wins out in the end , but more accurately what this proses is that skiers are the most dogged people in the world . If three or four of us had not refused to give up hope , among them Otto Schniebs and a ski expert who is also a postmaster , Ronald Mackenzie , of Lake Placid , we would still be stuck with one bad ski area on the northern end of Whiteface Mountain . That area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of high winds , and we have every hope that it will pay out when it becomes a supplement to our new , main ski center five miles away . The trait of stubbornness seems to be universal among skiers . Averell Harriman tells me that there were cries of horror from the board of directors of the Union Pacific when he proposed the development of Sun Valley . " What they demanded . " Throw money assay on skiing ? " Harriman stood firm . The Union Pacific , despite 11w first streamlined trains in the country , was losing passenger business to its rivals , the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe . They adsertised . " Go to California through the sunshine . " Union Pacific , pursuing a more northerly course through Wyoming and Idaho , could scarcely adsertise , " Go to California through the snow . " What Harriman did , by opening Sun Valley . was to make snow a salable commodity . The adsenture paid off in advertising value , even though Sun Valley operates at a modest deficit .

And , most recently , young Alexander Cushing , of the Boston medical family , who opened a resort at Squaw Valley .

It insured me nearly four years on skis during the war , not only in this coun try but also in Italy . Minny is now sixty years old  --  a hot-tempered bundle of energy . He founded not only the 10th Mountain Division but also the National Ski Patrol System , which binds up the wounds of injured skiers and assures them safe passage to the nearest hospital . In the winter of 1939-40 , with the ski patrol well under way . Dole was sitting at a meeting in Boston with , among others , Roger Langley , then president of the National Ski Association . The Finnish ski troops , at the moment , were giving the Russians a terrible shellacking . Maybe we ought to have ski troops in our Army , " Dole mused . " It looks as if we might be in this thing before long . " Langley pricked up his cars . " I 'll write a letter to Harry Woodring , offering the services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was currently Secretary of War . The letter evoked a routine answer : " We are grateful to you for your patriotic interest .... " Dole remarks , " By this time , I had a fixation on the subject of ski troops . It kept nagging me . One day in June . 1940 , I was sitting at my desk in downtown New York-1 was in the insurance business then  --  and I had nothing to do for lunch . Just on impulse , I took a ferry to the 1st Army ' base at Governors Island , in New York Harbor . I 'd never been there before in my life , and 1 did n't know a soul . " I walked into Gen. Hugh Drum 's outer office , explained my mission and said , ' I want to see anybody who will talk to me . ' A young captain named Phillips listened to me politely while I explained what ski troops could do , particularly if we went to war in a cold climate .

' Damn it , ' he said , ' you should sec General Marshall . ' George C. Marshall was then Chief of Staff of the Army , and the idea of getting in to see him seemed a little laughable . N P01 ? But then I remembered that a good fri of mine knew Arthur Palmer , an D , ft live assistant to Henry L. Stimson , had succeeded Woodring as Secretary of War . " Palmer laughed , too , when I him .

' When walked into Marshall 's office , he listened ! to me attentively , but he would n't corn mit himself . ' You 'll hear from me on the later , one way or the other , ' he said . " Dole by this time had virtually given up the insurance business to concentrate on the ski troops . After more than a sev , of tension , he recened a notice hoe ' Marshall and Stimson : " The 87th MOLINI lain Infantry Regiment will be activated ' at Fort Lewis , Washington , on Nos &; ber 15 , 1941 . " That was when his wont really began . He ceased selling insurancel and became the salaried head of the National Ski Patrol , assigned by the Army to recruit skicrs for the 87th Mows tain Infantry Regiment . To enroll in ilia regiment , a skier had to produce throw letters of reference , attesting not only to his skill but also to his qualities as an individual .

After three months of basic training , I reported In Fort Lewis in March of 1942 . The mountain troops were a remark- able outfit  --  a mixture of Tennessee hill ? billies with a good knowledge of woodcraft , who had been drafted into the 87tb ; a good many cowboys and mule skinners from the West ; a fair number of starry eyed dreamers like myself , who wanted to fight their War on skis , and an os env helm ing preponderance of young college kids . At one point in 1943 , the average intelli- gence quotient of the 86th Mountain In. fantry Regiment , one of the three corn-prising the division , was 122 . The Arms s minimum I.Q. for entrance into Officer Candidate School was 110 . This fact , when noised about , caused a good deal of trouble after the division finally reached Italy in January , 1945 .

The 34th , 88th and 91st divisions , above Bologna , followed soon after . But this was also not according to plan . The 10th was , in effect , supposed to provide flank protection for the others , At 9:30 on the morning of April twenty-third . the 87th Mountain Infantry crossed the Po River . the first American troops across . On the morning of May second , the division had fought its way up Lake Garda to the foot of the Alps . That was the day the Germans in Italy surrendered . It was a smashing yin : dication for the principle of ski and mountain troops , although the division proper never got to use its skis  --  not enough snow where it fought . It was also a smashing vindication for Minny Dole , who went 510.000 into debt to see the idea through . He is just now paying off the last of that money . I was , through no fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive . I had gone through the Infantry School to become a commissioned officer . By this time , also , I I had become a supervising instructor in ' the division ski school , and the executive officer of several schools dedicated to teaching soldiers how to climb a cliff without falling off . The upshot was that twenty of us  --  five officers and fifteen men  --  were picked to serve with the British Army in Italy . We came into Italy in December , 1943 , and all of us saw combat , but not with our own division . Also , we were about the only ski troopers who stayed on skis during the war  --  either on high-altitude patrols in the mountains east of Cassino or at a ski and mountaineering school seventy miles northeast of Rome , at a resort called Terminillo . This establishment was built on top of a mountain by Benito Mussolini , It offered , among other things , an aerial tramway  --  a cable-car device rising to the top of a high peak . Electric power Was al a premium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up most of the hydroelectric dams . I recall that we ran the tramway only once . We were riding merrily up the mountain when the phone rang . " This is the town major of Rome , " growled the voice on the other end , " What in bloody blazes arc you doing up there ? " When enlightened , he went on , " Well , you 'd better stop that damned thing . You 've cut off all the power from the tramcars in Rome . " It was at Terminillo that I first learned that there are other ways for soldiers to die than in battle , Two parties of skiers , learning high-altitude climbing , went out on the mountainside to reach the highest summit in that part of the Apennines . Ten minutes later there was a dull roar . The whole hillside peeled off . By the time I reached the scene with a rescue Party , two soldiers were dead , smothered by tons of wet snow that had frozen around their chests , so that they could n't breathe . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is one aspect of skiing which not many people take into account . There are grim hazards as well as pleasant moments . Every wintry section of this country has its perils . Half a dozen times parties of skiers have narrowly escaped freezing to death on the gale-swept cone of Mt . Marcy , which by Western or Alpine standards would be accounted a trivial peak . The winds there reach a velocity in the neighborhood of 130 miles an hour , and the temperature sometimes goes down to forty below zero . We have no avalanches along our Eastern ski trails , because the snow is rarely deep enough to slide and is confined by the forests on either side . But in the West , almost every winter someone blunders into an avalanche area . Even experienced skiers can be caught  --  men like Fred Iselin , head of the Aspen Ski School . with a long knowledge of avalanche conditions , Friends dug Fred out of an avalanche cone only a year ago . All they could see was his ski pole , protruding into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who perish . The high winter avalanches are generally of powder snow . These suck the air from your lungs and fill them with tiny particles , so that you smother . The spring avalanches are generally wet snow . This freezes around you , clamping your lungs , in an iron vise , so that you can not breathe . here arc hazards in ski racing too  --  a wonderful sport that sends you rocketing down a trail against time , shaving corners , taking the straight stretches at full speed , soaring out in the air over bumps , and pushing , pushing , pushing all the time to take the course faster than anyone else , I remember watching one young racer crack up at Sun Valley  --  though it could have happened anywhere . Somehow he tripped . He shot through the air headfirst , aimed straight as an arrow for a clump of pine trees . Somehow , like an acrobat , he managed to turn in space . Both skis struck the trees .

I doubt that , to him , skiing was worth it . Then there are the aging ski teachers who have somehow never managed to head up a ski school of their own . They arc still plugging along , coaxing their aching bones into high-speed turns that demand the utmost in technique , earning probably a few thousand dollars a year . They may wonder whether it was worth it too . But , to balance things off , there are millions of us who know of no finer sport than skiing . To rise in the morning , say in Switzerland , and to see a million diamonds glittering on the hillsides is an experience worth preserving . To ski down through knee-deep snow at Alta , in Utah  --  snow so deep that your skis are out of sight  --  and to make turn after turn with the powder spraying out in a cloud behind you  --  that , too , is worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Marcy on a frosty day , when the trees arc caked a foot deep with frozen rime , and a plume of snow is blowing off the sunny summit , is not an experience to be minimized .

Sometimes , when I am wearied of the big mountains , I slip on my skis and take a run or two down to the brook that bubbles , black and open , at the bottom .
