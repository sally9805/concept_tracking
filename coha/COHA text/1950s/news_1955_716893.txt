txt In the New Mexican desert I met a man who says he is positive the United States can defend itself from catastrophe with missiles . - The place seemed like a valley on the moon , an alkali plain about 40 miles across and 100 miles long , perfectly flat , surrounded by jagged mountains . At a casual glance , as you stand at the base of these mountains , the valley appears gaunt , great , and friendless . Spaces are so vast in this part of North America that human beings , in comparison to the landscape , seem insignificant . You have to look twice to realize that men are scurrying around there , more or less as they do everywhere . But in this desert place it was different . I had arrived at the White Sands Proving Ground where men are building the most ' uncanny machines of the future , guided missiles . ? As I looked yet a third time I could see several of these slender white objects far out amid the tumbleweed , standing as straight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as tall as telephone poles and several times as thick . The three which I saw that December day were scattered several miles apart . They were the Army 's adaptation of the old German V-2 , and are called the Corporal . The missile men were firing these monsters along the range in this geologic trough of sand for more than 100 miles . We stood a mile or so away and watched as each Corporal , belching fire and flame , rose off the ground , slowly at first , and then streaked away . To Carry H-Bomb ? " Those things wilt carry a hydrogen bomb , I suppose , " I remarked to the missile enthusiast , an officer well up in rank and station . He looked at me in that queer way of military people when they want to tell you something but can not say anything because security regulations prevent frankness . When the Germans operated their missile research ' and development station at Peenemunde on the Baltic in the early 1940 's there was no such place as the White Sands Proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tularosa Basin . Nobody went in there except to drive across on U. S. Highway 70 to the White Sands National Monument , that spectacular deposit of gypsum sand which , as you walk over its hummocks and valleys , makes you feel as if you were lost in a sea of borax . But after the war , when some of the Peenemunde natural scientists had joined the western Allies ( and others had gone over to the Soviets ) , the United States Army searched for a place where its " catch " of Germans could continue work . Tularosa Basin was selected in 1945 , and White Sands Proving Ground established . Somehow or other , man 's future is being shaped there in that desolate " valley of the moon . " And the work begun after World War II really is only beginning , my host commented . We went back to his office and talked long after sunset . I took no notes , for a pencil can ruin such an interview . The next morning I arose early and went out to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base turned gradually from deep rose to parched brown , as the sun reached over the rim of the basin , I put down a series of notes on our conversation , Adequate Defense Seen Here are what my notes say this missile expert told me. ( parenthetical observations are : his reporter 's ) : The United States can have adequate defense with groundto-air missiles . Present Nike batteries , which guard American cities , which have limited range ( estimates vary from 20 to 40 miles ) , will be improved . Missiles are breath-takingly more efficient than any artillery ever devised , even including the Army 's new Sky-sweeper antiaircraft gun ) . Ground-to-air . missiles for air defense can be more efficient in many instances than air-to-air . Surface-to-surface missiles can be fired accurately over ' ranges today in the vicinity of 100 miles . Tomorrow ( three or four years from now ) the accuracy can be extended to 500 miles . ( In other words , missiles could be fired from the city , of Washington , today , with accuracy , upon Richmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow missiles could be fired accurately from Washington to Boston ) . Even the airplane , only 50 years old , is not yet perfected . Work with missiles is just beginning . What the Germans did in missile development was prodigious . They intended to lob ** with a booster charge , upon New York City . Talos , a new missile being developed for air defense , will be used along with Nike . The United States , with defense in depth , can defend itself . Defense in depth means alternative belts of intercepter aircraft and guided missile stations . In missile work Americans can do anything  --  including building a space ship  --  provided men are willing to spend the energy and Congress is willing to spend the money . The Soviet Union can do so , too , for it likewise has missile experts . Proof Promised In the dark this man closed his office and we stepped out under the desert . sky . The big dipper rested upon the silhoutte of a range of montains to the north ; otherwise the heavens seemed huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on the moon . " Come back and see us next year , " he said . " Then we 'll have something to show you . I 'll have the proof for my statements by then . " The officer waved and vanished into the night . Out there in a desert place I had found a symbol of man 's determination to defend himself .
