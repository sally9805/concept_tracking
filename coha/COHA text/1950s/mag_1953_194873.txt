Turkey , making a thorough checkup at the start of the new year , found itself in excellent shape . The U.S. has pumped $400 million into its bloodstream since the war . By diligently using these millions to expand its productive capacity , the Turks have tripled their gross national production . U.S. Mutual Security officials deliberately encouraged the Turks to spend their aid on economic expansion , which would return repeated dividends , instead of on direct military purchases . The country 's resulting economic boom has brought $100 million more ( a 17% increase ) in government revenues in the last year , which in turn enables the militant Turks to pay the high cost of arming ( about 40% of their budget ) . <P> Mechanization is the main secret of Turkey 's expansion . The country imports 1,000 tractors a month . Where in 1949 Turkey imported 120,000 tons of cereal , this year it will be able to export 2,000,000 tons . Last year Turkey passed Argentina to become the fourth largest wheat-producing country outside the Iron Curtain .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
