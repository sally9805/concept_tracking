The exhibition at Paris ' Maeght Gallery last week was the kind that provokes many a parent to exclaim : " My kid could do better than that ! " <P> Some of the pictures ( with titles like The Red Sun Is Gnawing at the Spider ) looked like the absent-minded doodles of a preoccupied businessman . They were crammed with little stars , half moons , circles , eyes , teeth and amorphic blobs loosely knit together with wandering black lines . There were also sculptures and such : highly polished pear-sized bronzes and " objects " made of bricks , rusty wire and old bones . All these things were produced by Jon Mir , a Spanish-born painter-sculptor who has long been a fashionable exponent of all that is doodliest in modern art ( TIME , May 26 , 1947 ) . <P> Even for Mir , the " objects " were peculiar . One of them was a brick surmounted by a rusty brown sardine can and topped off with a pebble carved in the shape of a face . Mir called that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were about evenly divided between people and birds ; the catalogue told which was which . <P> But Paris sophisticates were delighted with the show . Orson Welles , Painter Georges Braque and Poet Paul Eluard were all on hand at the opening . Another poet , Jacques Prvert , had written a catalogue foreword which described Mir as " a smiling innocent gardener who strolls about in the garden of his dreams among the wild flowers of Multicolorado . " It was a strange country , but Miro 's multicolored Multicolorado did exert a cloudy charm on sympathetic visitors-just as children 's paintings often do . <P> Jon Mir himself , little , chubby and dapper , sports monogrammed shirts and a calm , businesslike air . " I lead a very regular , normal life , " he told a reporter , " I work every day from 6 a.m. to nightfall . At noon , before lunch , I take half an hour 's physical exercise . " After a reflective pause he added : " Outwardly I am perfectly calm , but internally I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small one in Paris ' Rue de Thran and a big one in Barcelona . At week 's end he dashed back to Spain to continue work on an 18-by-17-ft. mural for Harvard University 's new graduate center . The mural , he says hopefully , " will enable me to establish close contact with the students , the young men of tomorrow . It is better to influence the young generation than to try to convert stubborn old men . . . " <P> Will the Harvard mural turn out as abstract as his other works ? " I have never , " Jon Mir indignantly replies , " painted an abstract thing in all my life ! "
