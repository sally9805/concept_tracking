West Germany , where it is practically a tradition that " Germans do n't strike , " last week faced a nationwide labor revolt . <P> In Hamburg ( pop . 1,600,000 ) , a strike of 13,000 transport and utilities workers left West Germany 's largest city without gas , water , buses and streetcars for nine days . In Bavaria , 130,000 metal workers downed tools . Nine hundred thousand Ruhr metal workers demanded a 10-pfennig ( 2.5 ) hourly increase . <P> The strikes , which started spontaneously , spread quickly because the great mass of German workers were no longer willing to be left out of the amazing postwar prosperity which their hard work helped make possible . <P> West Germany 's gross national product has risen phenomenally , from $21 billion in 1950 to an estimated $34 billion today . Profits are high , and many a businessman has made a postwar fortune . But while German output rose 50% in four years , wages have risen only 21% . German trade unions had been persuaded to accept thin pay packets as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wages had to be kept low in order to regain the export markets . In addition , unemployment , fed by ten million refugees from Communism , made a man think twice before risking his job . The result was bad for all Germans : many German workers can not afford to buy the goods they produce for export . Only 2% of the 20,000 workers assembling Volkswagen drive to work in cars-unlike Ford and General Motors employees in Detroit , most of whom have cars of their own . The German worker 's average monthly wage of 325 marks ( $77.50 ) is far from enough when eggs cost 70 a dozen , good beef 90 a Ib . <P> U.S. foreign-aid experts think that German employers , who are now having export difficulty , can nonetheless well afford to raise wages . And by increasing the workers ' buying power , they will increase their sales at home .
