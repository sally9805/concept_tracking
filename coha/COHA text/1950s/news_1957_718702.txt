txt The American people , dependent as they are on regular mail deliveries at home and at their places of business , are unlikely to stand for any drastic curtailment of that service . That , at least , is what Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfleld is obviously counting on in his showdown battle with Congress for funds he considers necessary to to carry on regular postal services for the remainder of the fiscal year . $1.7 Million Promised ' nless he receives an additional $30,000,000 within a few days , the Postmaster General says he will not have money to keep post offices open on Saturdays , to carry on Saturday mail deliveries , to continue customary mail service to business sections , and other postal services . His effort to expose Congress to the public pressure through his " emergency " press confer- ence has been apparently not without its effect . The House Appropriations Committee has now promised the Postmaster General he can definitely count on $17,000,000 of his original request for $47,000 , - 000 additional funds to finish out the year . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum . But the Postmaster General is waging his battle with unrelenting vigor . In doing so , he is challenging one of the most powerful . committees on Capitol Hill . one to which department heads usually speak softly  --  the House Appropriations Committee . The threatened denial of this supplemental appropriation ? money needed because the original budget , appropriation proved inadequate ? has produced an unprecedented situation . Cost ** Charged In the first place , it was ap7. parcntly unexpected . Congress generally appropriates funds so that departments can finish out the year , pay necessary salaries , and furnish essential services . Last year , it granted two deficiency " appropriations to the Post Office Department  --  one for $16,000,000 for " operation , " and $100,000,000 toward pay increases granted postal employees . The reason the Post Office Department is coming out short this year , according to spokesmen there , is that costs of materials have gone up , pay increases were not adequately provided for , and employee retirement costs are now charged against the department budget . There seems little doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemental appropriation for the Post Office Department is due to the almost . hysterical excesses to which the congressional drive for economy appears to have gone . Now . with the promise from the Appropriations Committee that it will give consideration to the Postmaster General 's request for the full $47,000,000 , it seems unlikely that he will initiate the proposed mail service curtailments before that time . The week 's delay in taking up this matter by the full committee may provide a useful cooling off period , it is thought . Anyway , it will allow time for protest mail to hit Capitol Hill , thus providing impetus for a change of heart among economy-bent legislators . One of the most hopeful indications so far that Congress may , after all , concede in this instance is the statement of Representative John Taber ( R ) of New York . Mr. Tabor , one of the most ardent advocates of economy in government in the House , and ranking Republican member of the Appropriations Committee , had said that he believes there is a good chance the committee will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants , or at least something more than the $17,000,000 voted by the subcommittee . Congress Warned Congress was warned as long ago as last January that the funds allocated to the Post Office Department would be insufficient to carry it through . Mr. Summerfield 's original estimate of necessary additional funds was $53,000,000 . At least , that was the recommendation he made to the Budget Department . The Budget Department finally pared the sum down to $47,000,000 , but it . was March before the request reached Congress . While the Post Office Department was given some $3,000 , - 000 ; 000 for the current fiscal year , all but 4 per cent of that amount goes for fixed costs , over which the Postmaster General has no control . Thus , only about 4 per cent of the budget comes in the category of " controllable " funds . Hence , when the department runs out of appropriated funds , as in this case , the Postmaster General can not continue services for which he can not pay without violating the law .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
