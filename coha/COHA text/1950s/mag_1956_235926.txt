Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful <P> mood Strange pangs would flash along Childe <P> Harold 's brow , <P> As if the memory of some daily feud <P> Or disappointed passion lurk 'd below . <P> - Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage <P> Strange pangs flashed along the brow of Harold Stassen , onetime childe wonder of Republican politics . Long disappointed in his presidential passion , his daily feuds with such as Joe McCarthy grown pale and wan , Stassen , at 49 , felt the need to fare forth in quest of new political ad ventures . Last week he fared forth . He urged that the G.O.P. dump Vice President Richard Nixon in favor of Massachusetts ' Governor Christian A. Herter . <P> With President Eisenhower away in Panama , Harold Stassen called a news conference and , in gentle tones , read a prepared statement . He had , said Harold , received the results of private polls that showed Nixon running last to Herter 's first among Republican vice-presidential possibilities ( one of the others listed in the polling was Harold Stassen ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost Ike about 6% of the vote this fall , said Stassen . He stoutly maintained that he was acting only as a private citizen , not in his capacity as the President 's adviser on disarmament . Said Stassen : " I am deeply convinced that for the good of America and for the cause of peace no honorably avoidable handicap i.e. , Nixon should be placed on President Eisenhower in this election . " <P> The reaction to Stassen 's announcement was intense : 20 Republican Congressmen signed a demand for his resignation as a <P> White House aide ; later , 180 of the 202 G.O.P. Representatives pledged their support to Nixon . In Panama Presidential Press Secretary James Hagerty snapped that Stassen could not have made his statement as " a member of the President 's official family . " Republican National Chairman Leonard Hall said flatly : " My own prediction is that the ticket will again be Eisenhower and Nixon . " <P> Undying Loyalty . Harold Stassen had been a long time deciding what was " for the good of America and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart attack last year-perhaps too shortly , considering the niceties-he saw to it that the word got to the Vice President that Harold Stassen would be a 100% Nixon-for-President man in 1956 , got no answer at all . Again , after Ike announced that he would be available for renomination , Stassen sent Nixon his as surances of undying loyalty .
