( See Cover ) <P> As naturally as if it were digging along an old , familiar path instead of pioneering a new trail , the U.S. , with astute help from Great Britain , channeled Nikita Khrushchev 's demand for a summit conference into the United Nations . In doing so , the U.S. was not merely using the U.N . as a handy device for countering Khrushchev without stomping on its allies ' desires for a big-power meeting . In insisting on keeping the Lebanon crisis within the U.N. , the U.S. had a positive purpose : getting the U.N . to take responsibility for protecting Lebanon-and any other country similarly menaced-from subversion fomented from abroad . <P> Trying to accomplish U.S. purposes through the U.N . entails complexities and limitations . Before fixing the U.S. position on such questions as where the proposed U.N . summit conference should be held , what nations should take part , and what the procedures should be , the U.S. has to heed any U.N . member with strong opinions on these points-and opinions abound in the U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Lall reminded the U.S. 's U.N . delegation last week , wants to be invited to the conference , and to take part as a great power in any separate meetings of a Big Four , Five or Six .

" <P> Perspective of History . The entangling necessity of having to take into account the desires , pride , prejudices and whims of U.N . members has become a permanent complication of U.S. foreign policy . But it is by its own choice that the U.S. meets the complication . During the years since the U.N . ' s birth , the U.S. , in a momentous shift of national outlook and policy , has committed itself to trying to achieve some of its national objectives through the forum that President Eisenhower called " man 's best organized hope to substitute the conference table for the battlefield . " <P> In the perspective of history , involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound current in the nation 's past . Over most of its history , the U.S. has seen overpowering wisdom in George Washington 's farewell advice to take advantage of " our detached and distant situation " and " have as little political connection as possible " with foreign nations . Right down to World War II , many a U.S. citizen still believed that the nation 's " distant situation , " guarded from the Old World by two mighty oceans , made isolation the best policy .
