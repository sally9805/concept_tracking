The story might have rolled from Simenon 's prolific typewriter , and it calls for someone like his Inspector Maigret to solve it . The cast includes big-eyed , beautiful Dominique Lacaze , with a hint of mystery about her origins , and the two men of great talent and enormous wealth whom she married - Art Collector Paul Guillaume and Industrialist Jean Walter . There are the nagging riddles of their deaths , the odd behavior of her elegant brother Jean , the mysterious comings and goings of the magnetic Dr. Lacour , the ex-paratrooper willing to murder for money , and the fetching blonde prostitute called Mat . And , finally , there is the unloved and unloving adopted boy , Jean-Pierre Guillaume , around whom everything seems to revolve . At stake is one of the world 's greatest fortunes . <P> Wide Hat , Faint Smile . The story began in the exciting Paris of the 1920s , through which moved Dominique Lacaze , gathering admirers of her slim beauty and quick intelligence . In 1925 , she married Paul Guillaume , a wealthy art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of Andr Derain , whose portrait of Dominique shows her in a wide hat , with a faint smile , a withdrawn expression and eyes that a man could drown in . In 1934 Paul Guillaume died under curious circumstances . At first it was reported that he had been lost at sea on a fishing expedition , then that he had wasted away of a disease resembling paratyphoid . <P> To Dominique he left an estate of 6 billion francs ( then $375 million ) , which was promptly contested by his relatives . Under French law a widow ordinarily has the use of her husband 's fortune while she is alive but can not bequeath it to anyone save a direct heir . The Guillaumes had been childless in nine years of marriage ; yet now the rumor spread that , surprisingly , the beautiful Madame Guillaume was pregnant . Ten months later a baby boy appeared in her household . In 1941 she formally adopted the child , named him Jean-Pierre Guillaume , though he was often called Paulo .

By this time , Dominique had another devoted admirer , the architect and industrialist Paul Walter , whose revenues from the vast Zellidja lead and zinc mines in Morocco at one time represented 10% of the entire foreign revenue of France . They were married in 1941 . A tall , tough , humorous man , Paul Walter had both ideas and imagination . He gave away millions of francs , endowed hospitals from Paris to Istanbul , established the Zellidja Foundation , which offered tiny cash grants to young students on their pledge to travel widely and live by their wits ( TIME , Dec. 1 ) . He also had - with apparent prevision - strong feelings about the corruptibility of wealth , and therefore settled 30 billion francs on each of three children by a former marriage on condition that they would be dropped from his will . <P> To his new wife , Walter promptly made over some $60 million in stock and art treasures .
