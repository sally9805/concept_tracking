txt The hearings in the case involving Senator Joseph IL McCarthy and the United States Army have now begun in an atmosphere quite different from that which usually prevails when Mr. McCarthy is on the giving instead of on the receiving True , the batteries of television and movie cameras , the ubiquitous news photographers , the crowds of spectators all contribute a familiar circus touch to the hearing and all help to give it the somewhat less than judicial aspect that persons , who follow the McCarthy procedures have come to expect , But here the resemblance ends . The Senate subcommittee under the acting chairmanship of Mr. Mundt has adopted a set of rules designed to give fair and equal treatment to all parties at interest in this dispute . For once Mr. McCarthy has no special advantage over his adversaries and for once the people whom he has accused are placed in a position where they can adequately defend themselves . A number of factors contribute to this remarkable situation . For one thing , Mr. McCarthy is for all practical purposes temporarily divested of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , instead , at one end of a table with his aides and on exactly the same basis as the other principals in the case . While he has the right of cross-examination that he had never given any ' witness before his committee when he was chairman , the other principals have that right also . The subcommittee will hold no sessions unless a member of the minority party is present  --  an innovation where Mr. McCarthy is concerned . Both sides have the right to call witnesses and both sides have had plenty of opportunity to prepare their case  --  again a departure from Mr. McCarthy 's usual procedure . Most significant of all , Mr. McCarthy is no longer free to make ex parte statements at will in the guise of asking questions . The most refreshing moments in yesterday 's hearing came when Ray H. Jenkins , the subcommittee counsel , raised objections in his slow Tennessee drawl to efforts of Mr. McCarthy to inject into the record under cover of cross-examination alleged facts and opinions that could properly be introduced only Ss his own testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn up short , and Mr. Jenkins , sustained by Mr. Mundt , succeeded in doing just that So far as the testimony itself is concerned , obviously it is much too early to draw any conclusions . Mr. llicCarthrs insistence that his quarrel is not with the Army but with a handful of what he contemptuously referred to as " Pentagon politicians " is a patent effort to run away from the major issue that he himself has created . His quarrel is really not just with the Army but with the entire Executive Branch of the Federal Government . He ran true to form when he attempted to besmirch the character of the very first witness , Maj. Gen. Miles Reber , former chief of the Army 's legislative liaison branch , by suggesting that the latter had deviated from the normal performance Of his duties because his brother , former Deputy High Commissioner for Germany , had had a run-in with Messrs . Cohn and Schine on their famous " junketeering gumshoe " trip to Europe a year ago . It would have been too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jenkins that more than thirty employes at . Fort Monmouth had been " sus pended or fired " for Communist connections as a result of the McCarthy investigation there . But one might have thought that ' some member of the subcommittee would have informed Mr. Jenkins and the public how many of these employes are still suspended , and how many , if any , have been fired . It also would have been worth mentioning that from published evidence the case against some of them rests on extremely thin grounds indeed . It is an excellent thing that the hearings are being covered full3P by the press , television and radio . The American public will be able to judge for itself the relative merits - =of the Army 's case and of Mr. McCarthy 's case . For the first time we will also have the opportunity to see what Mr. McCarthy looks like when he is fighting . on the defensive , and not on his own terms .                   @ @
