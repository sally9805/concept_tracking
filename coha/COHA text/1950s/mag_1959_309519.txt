Bright and chipper as a schoolboy the first day of vacation , Marcos Prez Jimnez , 45 , ex-dictator of Venezuela , bounced into the Miami office of State Attorney Richard Gerstein to do some explaining . A Caracas columnist had written that Prez Jimnez pays $500 monthly for protection to the Miami Beach Police Chief , and Gerstein wanted to know all about it . Prez Jimnez denied that he paid the police chief anything , but admitted that he hires off-duty Miami cops and pays them a total of $1,025 monthly . He needs the cops for protection against homicidal enemies and to bear witness that he is not doing anything illegal in his $300,000 Miami Beach mansion , said Prez Jimnez . <P> The ex-dictator has already overstayed by more than a month a U.S. Immigration Service expulsion order , but he apparently reckons that his lawyers ' maneuverings will win him at least two more years in his beach house . The onetime dictator described a pleasant exile : swimming , archery , rowing , a few games now and then of dominoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan with wife and daughter to see My Fair Lady .
