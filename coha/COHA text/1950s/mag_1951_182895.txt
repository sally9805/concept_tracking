U.S. film critics , enjoying their annual late-December pastime of picking the screen 's best of the year , seemed to agree that the two best movies of 1950 were Paramount 's Sunset Boulevard and 20th Century-Fox 's All About Eve . The National Board of Review put Sunset Boulevard first , voted Gloria Swanson , in her sensational screen comeback , the year 's best actress . The New York Film Critics put All About Eve first , singled out Scripter-Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz as best director and Star Bette Davis as best actress . By citing Gregory Peck as best actor ( for his playing in Twelve O'Clock High ) , they gave an unprecedented clean sweep to one studio : Darryl F. Zanuck 's 20th Century-Fox . <P> As best director , the National Board named Scripter-Director John Huston ( for MGM 's The Asphalt Jungle ) , and as best actor , Alec Guinness ( for his eight-ply role in the British Kind Hearts and Coronets ) . The best foreign movie , according to the board , was The Titan , a Swiss-photographed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starring the works of Michelangelo . The New York Critics gave the foreign-film laurels to the Pagnol-Renoir-Rossellini omnibus Ways of Love . <P> As usual , the ticket-buying public paid very little attention to the critics . Only one of the National Board of Review 's ten best ( Twelve O'Clock High ) turned up among the top ten in Variety 's list of 1950 's biggest box-office grossers . The public 's favorites , in order of popularity : Samson and Delilah , Battleground , King Solomon 's Mines , Cheaper by the Dozen , Annie Get Your Gun , Cinderella , Father of the Bride , Sands of I wo Jima , Broken Arrow , Twelve O'Clock High .
