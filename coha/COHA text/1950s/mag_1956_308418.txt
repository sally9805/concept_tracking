On a visit to a ranch , Colombia 's cattle-raising President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla enthusiastically admired his host 's prize bulls , offered to buy one . " Your Excellency , " said the rancher , " I can not accept money from the President . I will give you a bull as a gift . " Replied Rojas , squaring his shoulders : " As President , I can not accept a gift . " <P> Rancher : Well then , Mr. President , I will sell you a bull-for one peso . <P> Rojas ( handing him a bill ) : Here 's 5 pesos . <P> Rancher : Mr. President , I have no change with me . <P> Rojas : That 's all right . Just give me four more bulls . <P> Colombians tell this joke , and several variations of it , to sharpen the point that , as President , Gustavo Rojas Pinilla has done very well for himself . Before taking power , Lieut . General Rojas lived in a modest rented house . In three years he has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As of last week , Rojas owned at least nine ranches and tens of thousands of cattle , all branded " 13 , " the lucky date in June 1953 when he brought off a swift military coup and began hurrying along the highroad to wealth . Rojas has a fenced-off market for his beef : he supplies the nation 's army commissaries , which not only provision the troops but sell to civilians as well . <P> Rojas ' favorite weekend hideout is his luxurious estate at Melgar . Since he acquired the place , millions of government pesos have gone into improving the highway that links it with Bogota , the nation 's capital , and millions more have been allotted for a rail spur from Melgar to the nearest railroad trunk . <P> Near Berastegui sprawls a 17,000-acre ranch that Rojas recently bought in an unusual auction . Originally the judge in charge of the sale insisted that the bidding start at 2,500,000 pesos . He was abruptly dismissed from his post . His successor lowered the starting bid by 800,000 pesos , and Rojas , the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated 8,000,000 . <P> Another Rojas ranch cost him nothing at all when the deal was completed . He bought a large estate at Gamarra for 500,000 pesos , then turned right around and sold half of it-the poorer half . Price : 500,000 pesos . Buyer : an agency of the Rojas government .
