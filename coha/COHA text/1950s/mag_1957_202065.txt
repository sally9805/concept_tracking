New Girl in Town ( book by George Abbott ; music and lyrics by Bob Merrill ) . No one in the American theater has trudged so far or so heroically or so alone , been so indifferent to pace or careless of pitfalls as Eugene O'Neill . No one in the American theater has proved such a steam calliope down the Main Stem , shown such a knack for pacing , for well-oiled speed , for sociable razzle-dazzle as George Abbott . And with the insouciance that pervades the American theater , when a musical is made of O'Neill 's Anna Christie it is George Abbott who writes the libretto and directs the show . <P> The result is no more a miraculous meeting-and mating-of extremes than a head-on catastrophe . It is , instead , an often pleasant but an always misguided show . The trouble is that extremes do n't meet and that oil and salt water do n't even try to mix . They carefully avoid each other : when traffic moves north and south for O'Neill , it halts east and west for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former **26;11593;TOOLONG , her rather bleary , seafaring father , and her suitor who learns of her sordid past , is set inside a gaudy , frilly , foolish , turn-of-the-century lace valentine . <P> Far from being ruthless with Anna Christie , Abbott has been all too faithful to her in his fashion , hewing neatly to the plot line and merely jettisoning all mood , unity and cumulative effect . Anna Christie might make a good , serious musical drama that would sustain O'Neill 's story better than O'Neill did . But for capers-and-confetti musicomedy it can only be a death's-head at a feast . <P> The capers and confetti are often happily present . In New Girl no one even mentions " that old davil sea " ; the waterfront is covered with period folderol , with tars and tarts and tararaboomdeay . Bob Merrill has composed a pleasantly undistinguished score , at its best in such a mildly rowdy ballad as Flings or such a lilting , deliberate throwback as The Sunshine Girl . And , one earthbound ballet aside , Bob Fosse has provided dances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna , Gwen Verdon proves something more than a mere musicomedy actress . All the same , she is first and foremost a wonderful dancer , and not the least of the libretto 's sins is how badly it rations her dancing-her comic dancing in particular . As an old waterfront rip , Cinemactress Thelma Ritter endows a rather inelastic role with a winning , raffish charm . Cameron Prud'homme makes a good father and George Wallace a good suitor . But leading such a left-hand , right-hand life , Anna Christie is neither her old self nor really a new girl either .
