 | Following her , Steve said , " When I took my turn at janitor I almost burned the schoolhouse down . " " I 'd have thought you were the efficient type . " They went up the steps ; there was a little lull in the wind , and for a moment there was only the low thunder of the surf behind their voices . " I was . I stuffed the stove with good dry spruce , opened up everything , let her go Gallagher , and went out to ring the bell . " He opened the door . " I was a real fancy bell ringer , as fancy as you can be with one bell . Thought I was ringing Dick Whittington 's Bowbells that day  --  we 'd been reading about him . " The wind struck the schoolhouse with a shuddering impact ; the door was slammed violently shut . They were shut in the narrow dark space of the entry . " All but took my hand off , " said Steve in mild astonishment . His voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became deafening . They had a queer , pungent scent she had never noticed before . Half stifled , she groped for the knob of the inner door . Always her hand had gone straight to it ; this was n't the first time the door had blown shut and left her in the dark . Nerves prickled in the small of her back as she searched , using the flat of both hands . It was as if the close black area of the entry had some unique symbolism which she feared . Idiot ! she cried contemptuously within herself . " Lost the knob ? " Steve said . " Wait , I 've got a match . " His oil clothes rustled loudly . A new gust struck , forcing a faint clang like a cry from the bell . She found the knob just as the match flared up behind her . " I 've got it ! " she said eagerly . She laughed , out of breath ; she might have just been running . The gray light of the schoolroom was inexpressibly dear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the windward side , the familiar scents of the birch fire , chalk dust , the recent occupancy of children . She was safe now in her own frame of reference . " Anyway , " he said , " I set the chimney afire , and they would n't let me be janitor any more . " She turned toward him , smiling . He sat on a desk in his bright oil clothes , looking ruefully at the stove . She said , " You sound as if you were still unhappy about it . " " I was remembering how I used to wish I 'd burned the place to  | the ground . Everybody disapproved of me for so long afterward , and then when they got over the scare , it got to be a good joke , even on Brigport . . . . Here 's the tyke who set the chimney afire , hey ? You think you was Steamboat Bill , chummy ? ' I wished I 'd burned the schoolhouse down so they 'd look at me as if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Funny how we go through the stage when we ache to be wicked and have everybody look at us with horror . There 's a certain respect with that ; it gives you some kind of stature . But ridicule turns you into nothing . " " You sound as if you 'd been through it too . " " I have . " She went to her desk . " Was your errand to do with me ? " she asked . He looked at her as if he was thinking of something else . She waited , and then he came back from his remoteness , smiled and rubbed the side of his jaw . " The boys are getting up a dance at the clubhouse Wednesday night . I 'd like to take you . You can see I 'm getting my bid in early , while the others are working out their strategy . " " Does it take strategy to invite the schoolma'am to a dance ? " " On this island , " said Steve , " it takes strategy for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours worked today . I 'm so flattered by the way you beat through a storm that I could n't think of refusing . Will there be square dances ? " " Square dances and waltzes are all you get around here . If any reckless feller comes up with something later than 1900 , he learns right off that nobody approves of those flighty modern ideas . " " I can see that this is my spiritual home , " said Philippa solemnly . " At school dances I was always stuck with some bright boy who had a lot of original steps to try out . It 'll be nice to know exactly what to expect . " " Our dances are n't that cut and dried . The boys got Gregg to say he 'd play his clarinet , and now they 're trying to think of a way to keep him sober till Wednesday night . Then they 'll give him a bottle of wine because he plays the best when he 's had just enough . The problem is to keep him from going past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be a very interesting affair , " said Philippa.  | The outside door opened and crashed shut , and there was a series of thuds and gasps in the entry . " My janitor is arriving , " she said . " In two parts . " " Well , I 'll get back to the harbor . " He picked up his sou'wester . " I 'll call for you about eight Wednesday night . " When he opened the door , Ralph and Rob fell in through it , locked in an extremely original wrestling hold . " Break it up ! " one of them exploded . They got up , Ralph rubbing his ear and blushing . Rob looked quickly from Philippa to Steve . " Hey , what are you doing here , Uncle Steve ? " he asked . Ralph snickered , and Rob whirled on him , punching . Their laughter went rapidly from hysteria to idiocy . Philippa said , " No roughhouse in the schoolroom , boys . " They fell apart , wet-eyed and panting . Steve said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be kept in a barrel and fed through the bunghole . " " That 's a good idea , " said Philippa . " Or the sort of zoo with no fences but nice deep moats they could n't possibly cross . " The boys , trailing odd wheezes and gurgles and clumping unnecessarily in their rubber boots , hung up their damp jackets . Ralph sat down at his desk and became deeply involved with his English grammar . Rob squeezed by his uncle without looking at him and went out into the entry to ring the bell . " I 'll get out of here before anyone else has the high fantod at sight of me , " said Steve . Over Ralph 's head they exchanged faint smiles that could n't escape a tinge of intimacy . Steve went out and Philippa walked back to her desk . In the brief hiatus before the others came , she tried to think objectively of the sensation she had experienced when she came from the lane and saw Steve standing by the schoolhouse , and of her more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like someone blindfolded and spun around three times and then told to find the doorknob . For a matter of seconds her world had gone off its axis . If it had happened to someone else who told her about it afterward , she would have said with some amusement , " You did n't want to find your way out of the dark entry . You knew where the knob was , but you would n't let yourself find it . " She felt a wash of heat rising over her body . You deserve to be un-  | comfortable , she told herself ruthlessly . You have read too much sensational drivel and taken it seriously . She saw herself sitting at the desk in her russet dress , gracefully erect , her hands folded before her , her face serene , the events of the past until this moment wiped from it as if they had never taken place . This was the way to begin the afternoon , to begin a lifetime . Never carry into the next hour what should be left in the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme . But his candor about his limitations as a scholar charmed Philippa while she deplored it . He was not ashamed of being in the third-grade arithmetic class while Schuyler Campion did knotty problems with the eighth grade . While the rest of the school worked , Rob dreamed , his round face with its tilted Tartar eyes and snub nose rapt with the visions that passed gloriously across his mind . Whenever he became conscious of Philippa 's glance , he grinned , scratched his head , and shrugged , as if the whole question of study were a quaint fable which neither he nor Philippa believed . It was a pity to recall him to base reality . But there was the matter of his pass from the sixth grade to the seventh . She had until June to get him through three years of arithmetic . Studying his papers , which showed great ingenuity in getting nine-eighths or five-fourths out of a whole , she wondered what Mrs. Gerrish had done with her time . Rob had agreed with Philippa from the first that something must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kathie had agreed to supervise his homework . " Helmi was going to help him once , " she said , " but Mark nearly blew his top listening . He said he did n't believe Rob could be so stupid . So he took it over . And then he said to keep Rob out of his reach after that because he could n't be responsible for his own actions . But I wo n't have any trouble . I 'm younger so I can stand more of him . " She went back to her seat , too sure of herself to swagger . On this afternoon of the northeaster , Philippa kept Rob in . Clare Percy stayed to wash blackboards . She switched importantly about the room , doing her chores with elegant flourishes of elbows and wrists . The swing of her red bob and the firm clatter of her shoes expressed her efficiency . Sometimes she allowed herself a cynical smile at Rob 's struggle . Philippa sat beside him , unveiling the  | arcanum of fractions by the most elemental means . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulled comfortably and the clock ticked with a sleepy beat . A sort of coziness settled over the room . They were startled when the outer door slammed and the inner one flew open . Clare exclaimed dramatically and flapped her hand against her flat gingham chest . Rob and Philippa looked around . Young Charles stood there in his oil clothes , his skin moist and ruddy from the cold rain . He dropped his sou'wester on the floor , and grinned at Clare . " Hello , Gingertop . You been up to deviltry and got kept in ? " Clare 's freckles were orange against her blush . " I 'm helping the teacher , " she said with dignity . " Clare 's a real help to me , too , " said Philippa . " What about this one then ? " He moved forward and lifted Rob 's head by one long tow-colored lock . Rob said amiably , " I 'm stupid . " Clare stood watching , an eraser in each hand . Charles winked at her and she blushed again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you come on business ? " " Sure I 've got business , " he said . " Real important business . We 're going to have a time at the clubhouse Wednesday night . Fort and I got it up . I 'll take you . " Rob whistled . Clare turned her entranced gaze on Philippa , her lips parting over her big front teeth . Philippa stood quickly , gathering up her book and pencil . " Wait a minute , Charles . . . . You can go now , Rob . Work on the things I 've marked . You 've done beautifully , Clare . Thank you very much . " She went up the center aisle to her desk . Charles had come in with such a happy assurance . At least she could clear the children out before she answered him . Rob prepared noisily to leave , giggling when Charles told him he was a proper gorm . But Clare looked about her in a distracted way and then back at Charles as if he were the sun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippa said . " I 'm leaving in just a few minutes . " To reassure her that she was not being sent out just because Young Charles had come in , Philippa closed up the stove for the night . Clare went sulkily to get her boots and raincoat . It was an existence without a future , to be eleven and so cruelly  | plain , and to be called Gingertop by anyone as beautiful as Young Charles . Philippa began to set her desk in order for the night . In a few moments she saw Clare running across the marsh . Rob was already out of sight . " Now , Charles , " she said briskly . A change from good humor to resentment had come while her back was turned . He walked down the aisle and stood in front of the desk , his thumbs hooked in the bib of his oil pants , looking at her from under the black bar of eyebrows . " I 'm not one of the school kids . So do n't talk as if I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , trying to sound remorseful . " I 'm sorry . It 's just that I 've been using that tone all day . Occupational disease , I guess . " She began to straighten the books between the leather-covered book ends that had been Justin 's . Now I am being a coward , she thought . And why ? He ca n't have everything he wants in this world ; he ca n't walk in here and tell a woman of thirty what is to be done , and expect to be humored simply because he wants it so much . Her fingers rested on the rough binding of Leaves of Grass . If she opened the book , Justin 's writing would be inside , but that would be no help to her now . Charles 's hand shot over the books and caught her wrist . For a moment she was too astonished to speak . She gazed quietly at his hand , as if she were making a study of the broad back with the bronze-tipped hairs , the sheen of the tight knuckles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and looked at him . " You 're stopping the circulation , Charles . " " Will you listen to me , then ? " He dropped her hand and came around the desk . His full lower lip moved out sulkily . " Do you think I should listen , after that ? " " Then I 'll be gettin ' out of here ! " He turned angrily with a crackle of oilskins . " Wait , " she said in a low voice . " You came to ask me to go to the dance , and I did n't want to answer in front of the children . You know how they 'd love to carry it . I 'm sorry , Charles , but I 've already accepted another invitation . " " Fort ? " he demanded . She had to smile . " Not Fort . Your uncle Steve . " He stared at her in incredulous outrage . " How in Tophet 's name  | did he know about it ? " he demanded hoarsely . " We only got it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayeh . I remember now . We were having a mug-up at Jo 's . He was knitting trap heads in by the radio . I thought he was listening to news and weather . Well , I made a horse 's  --  a fool out of myself , did n't I ? " " There 'll be other dances , wo n't there ? But if you feel you 've been had , I wo n't go at all . " He shrugged savagely . " All right , all right . I 'll be a good loser . But right here and now I 'll put my oar in for the next dance . " He glared at her . " That 's a date then . " " Sorry I mohaggled you , " he muttered . " I know you wo n't do it again . " He said something else she did n't understand and went back to the door . He bent down and picked up his sou'wester ; when he straightened up , he smiled at her . The hostility might never have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huh ? " " Always a tomorrow , " she repeated , and smiled too . If there was a tenderness about her , it was because at the moment when he left he seemed hardly older than Eric . Chapter 20 The weather turned fair and seasonably cool after the storm . Fresh breezes blew across the island , not enough to keep the men from hauling but sufficient to keep the water in a continual diamond sparkle . At recess the children kept warm by practicing square dances in the schoolyard . Everyone who knew the figures would be sure of partners on Wednesday night . Sky Campion brought his harmonica to school . He sat on the steps , tapping his foot and playing " The Irish Washerwoman " over and over while the others clapped , swung , and promenaded through the dances . Sometimes Rob played so that Sky could take his turn at practicing . He danced with the preoccupied expression of a young  | scientist , even while he was swinging one of the Percys so fast she whitened under her freckles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest ones were lined up and shunted through the figures . Entirely engrossed , the most gangling of the boys moved with the innocent grace of all young creatures . Kathie responded fluidly to the rhythm , even when she was n't dancing . Peggy Campion moved through " Hull 's Victory " with the proud , somber detachment of an Infanta performing a court pavane . Everybody talked about the dance in one way or another . Helen Campion had come in after supper the night before . " My Lord , if they had a dance twice a week , ' t would suit me fine ! We have n't had a thing in that clubhouse since Labor Day . Herring ! That 's all I 've heard for weeks . I told Foss that if any man on this island comes in tomorrow night and says there 's herring in the harbor , I 'll shoot him myself , personally ! " She stamped her foot and flung herself back in the chair , shaking with laughter . Philippa laughed too , it was impossible to resist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going to dances and flinging herself headlong into the music and noise as a swimmer dives into the sea . She wondered if Helen were ever intimidated by the poise of her blase daughter , Peggy . Suze twisted her forehead and blinked at her knitting as if their laughter interfered with the counting of stitches . Asanath said , " I b'lieve you would shoot him , Helen . I b'lieve you would . I never saw anybody so set on dancing as you . " " And light on my feet , Asa ! Light as goosedown , for all my size ! " Her eyes flashed . She rocked back again , triumphant . Viola Goward had come in quietly , and now she stood in the kitchen doorway . " You 'll be all worn out before you get there , " she said dryly . " Shouting like you 'd been in a rumshop . " Smiling mysteriously , she came into the room . She dropped her coat and adjusted a loose pin in her knot of sandy hair . Her gaze flashed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came back to Philippa . " Got you a beau for tomorrow night ? " " Of course , " said Philippa , laughing . Asanath pulled on his pipe . " Should n't think you 'd ask such personal questions , Vi . Why do n't you wait and see ? "  | " Oh , I 'll know who it is before the time comes ! Likely I know now . " Her air of omniscience was cheerfully arrogant . " But I 'll keep my mouth shut about it . " " For once , " Asanath murmured . Vi pretended not to hear . Helen said gayly , as if she were trying to regain her mood of anticipation , " If it 's a clear night , there 'll be a crowd over from Brigport . I like plenty of couples on the floor for Lady of the Lake . ' " " Be plenty of cuddling going on outside too , " said Vi . " At the last dance you could n't go out back without seeing nature in the raw under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vi , it was n't that bad ! What 'll Philippa think of us ? " " What indeed ? " Viola 's eyes challenged Philippa with a spirited cynicism . " She 's human , is n't she ? She 's young . She knows what happens at dances , whether it 's our kind or the fancy ones she 's used to . Liquor is liquor , and people are people . " " That 's an incontestable point , Mrs. Goward , " Philippa said , smiling . " People are people , all right . But I ca n't tell you much about dances these days because I have n't been to one for years . " Viola adjusted a hairpin with a sudden stabbing motion . She seemed peculiarly exhilarated , high color on her shiny cheekbones . " There were three schoolteachers rented a cottage on Brigport last summer . I guess they were out for their last fling , by the looks of some of their actions ! One of ' em made a perfect fool of herself over Young Charles . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How did they behave at the dances ? " Philippa asked politely . " I was n't talking about that . They knew better than to act up in public . That 's the best I can say of them . " " Well , that 's quite a lot , " said Philippa lightly . " Now as for me ? why , I have n't been to a dance for so long I ca n't be sure how I 'll react to all the excitement . It 's like liquor , you know . Some people take just one drink and disgrace themselves . " Vi stared at her suspiciously . Philippa added , " You just ca n't tell , ' what with my being a schoolteacher and all . " There was an instant of silence before Helen flung herself back in her chair , shrieking with laughter . Asanath chuckled ; even Suze , looking at Viola 's bleak face , smiled . When Helen 's tumult had died down , Vi folded her hands tidily in her lap .  | " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit . I 'm sure there 's plenty on Bennett 's Island who 'll appreciate that in the teacher . " She turned squarely in her chair . " Have you tried that new heel yet , Suze ? It wears like iron in Syd 's socks , but maybe it 's me more than the heel . I was never one to let him wear a pair of socks more than two days in those stinking old rubber boots . " The light flashed on Suze 's glasses . " Well , I 'm not one to let Asa wear dirty socks either , " she answered with unusual determination . Chapter 21 On the night of the dance Steve came for Philippa . The afterglow had deepened to blue dusk , which became night with the clear starry stillness that precedes frost . Two boats came from Brigport ; their engines were audible on Bennett 's Island from the time they came around Tenpound . Steve and Philippa were walking around the harbor when the boats came up Long Cove , and they could hear singing over the hum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt deep within herself , like a young bird held carefully in the hand , a tremulous and youthful anticipation of the night ahead . The irony of it amused her . When she was fifteen or so and should have felt like this , she had approached such occasions with an aggressive blend of valor and antagonism . It was nice to have grown beyond all that . When you were young and yearned for the privileges of maturity , you could not guess what the best of the privileges would be . " Security , " she said . " What ? " asked Steve . " Did I miss something ? " " No , I was thinking aloud . I was thinking about the security of being thirty , and all the things you can enjoy in a calm , unqualified way without trembling on the verge of ecstasy or woe . " " Does that end when you 're thirty ? " " It should , if a person is sufficiently mature . " He did n't answer , and his silence piqued her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you think it 's possible to  | reach a state of calm after storm ? Oh , I know I have a boy to raise , but I do n't anticipate any more than the usual amount of confusion that goes with an ordinary child . And I hope I can take that as an adult should . Apart from him , I expect to do my work and live my life with no great heights and no great depths . I 've had them all . " Suddenly she felt as if she were talking too much . She had n't planned on sounding so smug . My noble aunt , she thought , blushing . They were safely in the dark again , walking along the path by the well toward the lane that led to the clubhouse . She thought angrily , Why did I have to start this ? It 's quite possible that I 've spoiled my evening . " I was n't sniping , " Steve said after a moment . " I was admiring you . " What about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and come back , you go quietly from one day to the next . You must have achieved some sort of compromise with life . " " I have . But the trouble is , I do n't know how long it will last . " They turned into the lane . Ahead of them , light fell from the open door of the clubhouse ; there were the sounds of scuffling and laughter from the porch , children shrieking as they ran around the building in a game made mysterious and terrifying by the dark . Above it all , the music floated in random , disembodied fragments  --  a liquid run on the clarinet , the thin unworldly merriment of a violin playing a phrase of a reel for the accordion to follow . There were people coming behind Philippa and Steve in the lane . The little Percys pounded by like foals . A flashlight bobbed across the field from Nils Sorensen 's house . Philippa looked up at the black lances of the spruces reaching for Orion ; she breathed the quiet cold of frost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane . She heard the voices ringing out like bells in the island night , and the scraps of music coming together suddenly into a tune . " Sometimes we 've had dances up here that have been wicked disappointments , " Joanna said to Philippa . " Sometimes there 's a feeling  --  it 's hard to describe  --  that everybody 's been flung out to a different point of the compass , and even if we all gather up here , we might as well be perfect strangers because we ca n't get together in our minds . But when there 's a good dance , it 's like this . Every-  | one wants it to be good , and they 've got it in them to make it a fine thing . It 's another sort of feeling , an outgiving . For a little while , all the grievances are stowed out of sight . " " I should n't think there were too many grievances on a place like this , " said Philippa . Joanna gave her a dark , subtly mocking glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a dance not from lack of partners but from choice . With thirty couples or more to take part in " Lady of the Lake , " there was so much swinging that Philippa had been grateful to be on her feet at the end of the last one . The clubhouse had kept on whirling , and she clutched at her partner 's arm . It was Nils Sorensen . He had laughed and led her back to her seat with his arm snugly around her waist . " You 've got no head , " he told her . " You 'll have to do better than this . We had a schoolma'am once who could swing all the men off their feet . " Philippa had been guided through the first of the dances by Steve , Young Charles , and Nils . After that her partners had been varied ; Foss Campion , young Ralph Percy , Mark Bennett , Sky Campion and a Brigport fisherman in lusty middle age . When she counted up the changes of partners in " Liberty Waltz , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a poor dancer yet . Young boys and girls learned how to dance in the most natural manner possible . There was no artificial segregation of age groups ; neither the young nor the old were embarrassed in one another 's company . Steve went out on the porch for a cigarette . Joanna went off down the hall to speak to a Brigport woman , and Philippa sat peacefully alone for a few minutes . She followed first one person and then another through the play of light and shadow under the hanging lamps . Now and then someone stood out against the involved pattern as if spotlighted . Once Kathie came toward her , her hair like an aureole under the lamps , and then was swung away . She saw Young Charles , bending in a courtly way to swing Clare Percy , whose small face was frozen with happiness . Helen Campion danced with Asanath ; she was as light on her feet for her great size as she had claimed . Nils 's partner was Suze . She still looked confused and indefinite , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Fort stood propped against the cold stove and went from one tune to the other without a change of pace . She knew some of the more common ones : " Turkey in the Straw " ; " Old Zip Coon " ; " Golden Slippers " ; " Little Brown Jug . " Joanna had given her more names : " The White Cockade " ; " Stack of Barley " ; " The Rakes of Mallow " ; " My Love Is But a Lassie Yet " ; " The Dawning of the Day . " She loved them ; she would write them all to Eric , but how was she to tell about Fort with his fiddle snugged under his round chin , his red brush coppery in the lamplight , his eyes shut to slits , his thick fingers marvelously agile on the strings , and the bow dancing with its own wild , unearthly music ? Fort played alone at the moment . The accordionist , a Brigport boy , had gone out for a smoke and some of the beer his friends had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregg had gone out too . The whole island , except for the Websters , seemed to be represented , either in the hall or out on the porch . She had seen Perley standing in the doorway once , in the group that did n't take part but loitered outside , looking on . Terence had come in briefly , he had waltzed once with Kathie , and then he had gone out again . Philippa wondered if the Webster children heard the music . Their house was the nearest to the clubhouse . They must have heard it jigging and ringing in the windless night . All this warmth and joy , and they were shut away from it by their fear ; they were afraid even to come and peek in at the windows because someone might touch them in the dark . She knew their father by sight , a man who looked frail and awkward in the guise of a fisherman , as if it were an illfitting costume . She tried to picture the mother ; what sort of fey creature was she ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall was emptying ; it was a sort of breathing spell , with the men going out to the porch and the women moving around to visit with one another . Fort put his fiddle in the case and went out . Young Charles leaned over her suddenly . " What are you dreaming about ? " he murmured . " Island life , " she said . " I like it . " " Let 's talk about it some . Let 's go for a walk , down to Mark 's wharf and back . " His eyes glistened . " It 's some handsome out . Know anything about the stars ? Andromeda , the Great Square of Pega-  | sus ? " He gave off an aura of ardent vitality , the way a spruce forest under a hot sun gives off an exciting resinous breath . If I were seventeen , thought Philippa , I should be thoroughly intoxicated by now . She let him talk on and watched Viola Goward with Mrs. Percy ; they sat directly opposite . Mrs. Percy was a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth were forever being set on edge . They were talking fiercely against the buzz of other voices and the noise of the children who kept lashing themselves awake by sliding on the dance floor . They were also watching Philippa . The shrewd glances flicked toward her and Charles at rhythmic intervals . " Did you ever go rowing when the water was firing ? " asked Charles . " Come on , Philippa . " She said with amiable firmness , " No , Charles . " His face tightened . He got up quickly and walked toward the open door . Philippa was sorry for him and at the same time annoyed . His self-assurance would have been crass in someone with less charm . She had liked him better when he had walked through the woods with her ; then he had been a little shy , a little stricken with the newness of what he felt . He passed Steve in the doorway without speaking to him . Steve turned his head and looked after him briefly . Then he came inside , and his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin and straight , with a way of holding his narrow , neat dark head that expressed an inherent self-command .

It is n't possible that there 's another faster , more complicated dance , is it ? " " Gregg 's got at the beer . They 've been trying to steer him away from it , but he could smell it at forty fathoms . " His eyes puckered at the corners . " It was quite a thing . Everybody falling over everybody else in the dark , looking for him , and he was farming off down the lane with his arms full of beer cans . When the beer meets up with that sherry , there 'll be some mighty interesting results . " " And the boys worked so hard to keep him in shape , " Philippa said . Poor Charles , she thought . Something else to frustrate him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he 'd go home and stay . But he 's had his beer and he 's back again . They  | asked him to play for a dance , by crikey , and he 'll play for a dance . " A roar of laughter went up from the porch . Fort came in , moving rather rapidly , and picked up his fiddle . He winked at Philippa . Then Gregg appeared , flanked by Nils Sorensen and a lanky Brigport man . They were laughing still , but Gregg was solemn . He pulled himself free of them and tried to straighten his tie , which had got worked around under one ear . His faded eyes were wet with concentration , and his mouth was prim . He walked the length of the hall with short , precise steps . In spite of his pudginess and the tendency of his rumpled blue serge trousers to drop below his belly , he achieved a queer sort of dignity , perhaps because he was so intent . The accordionist took his place , sank his chin moodily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Choose your partners for a waltz ! " Charles shouted angrily from the doorway , and went out again . Fort began " Let Me Call You Sweetheart , " and the accordion joined in . Steve and Philippa went out onto the floor with the rest . " Optimists , " said Steve . " Perhaps he wo n't play , " said Philippa . " He looks sleepy . " But over Steve 's shoulder she saw Gregg lift his clarinet . There was a wild and intricate soaring of notes like the flight of a singing bird . For a few minutes the others plunged doggedly on , but Gregg was too close to them ; they could hardly hear their own music . Fort gave up first , undone by his sense of humor . The accordionist played like a mechanical toy wound up until he saw that no one was dancing . Gregg played on , his eyes shut ; he was lost in a world of his own making , starred with a glittering swarm of notes . He swam among them as effortlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his moment of truth . The Brigport people who had never heard Gregg drunk gaped at him ; the children roused from their sleepiness . Someone said loudly , " Well , I never ! It 's a disgrace , allowing that man inside the clubhouse ! He 's tight as a coot ! " Steve and Philippa were near the door . " Let 's go out , " he said . " The dance is over . Gregg is all set for hours . " " My coat ? " she began . " I 'll get it . " When he came back , they went out through the knot of men listening at the door . When they were away from the chuck- les and the crude jokes , the music sounded fiercely sweet in the night . Halfway down the lane , Philippa stopped to listen . " He 's good , Steve . No wonder he was so dignified . He knew . " " Yes , he 's good . He played in the Navy Band once . Funny what the spontaneous combustion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wish they would n't laugh at him , " she said angrily . " Do n't they realize what they 're hearing ? How many of them could get even one decent sound out of that clarinet ? " " That 's why they laugh , to keep Gregg in his place as an old derelict . But he does n't hear them . There 's your security for you . All he hears is his music . " " Poor Fort and Charles , " she said . " It 's spoiled their dance . " " It was almost over . They 're lucky Gregg did n't smell the beer earlier . " His fingers tightened on her arm . " Where shall we go ? " " It 's time for me to go home . " Her voice sounded shallow in her ears . To stand like this in the dark put her at a disadvantage . The place seemed completely unfamiliar to her ; she might as well have been dropped from space onto a mountain peak . Steve was a presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , fingers on her arm , the scent of a tweed jacket worn by a clean and orderly male who smoked . What was her own sum total as a presence ? she wondered . " It 's a beautiful night on the water , " he said . " I have a little dory that goes like a gull feather before the wind . " He did n't release her arm . His voice brushed her in the shadow like the first warm airs of spring . " Now do you want to go home ? " It was a warm air , but she felt somehow cold . " No , I suppose not , " she said slowly . She wanted to keep talking , to ask bright vivacious questions about the dory , but she could n't think of anything . When he moved , she was n't surprised . He took her by the shoulders and kissed her . It was as gentle , and as positive , as all his movements were . Her mind tried frantically to right itself ; her heartbeat seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the pale powdering of the Milky Way going down toward the woods , and they were the same as they had been a minute before , but she had changed . Something had been liberated which she had barely known to exist . If only I had gone home ! she kept thinking . The thought tolled like a bell . If only I had gone home . He put his arms around her and kissed her temple and cheek-  | bone . She felt a sadness , but at the same time her hands , moving independently , pressed against his hard lean sides under the tweed jacket , and she turned her mouth toward his . The dismay and rejoicing whirled together until she could not tell one from the other . In a few moments they moved apart as naturally as they had come together . The sound of his breathing had a peculiar intimacy for her . " Look , " she said . " They 're coming . " She saw the flashlights on the far . side of the field and heard the voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamps in the clubhouse were being blown out one by one . She was looking across the black frosty space into another world which held no significance for her whatever . One flashlight bobbed toward them . They heard Joanna 's strong , gay voice . " Good night , Ella ! Good night , Vi ! " Steve took Philippa 's hand . " Come on , " he whispered . " Through the windbreak . " They ran over the uneven ground , passing through a gap in the long row of Sorensen spruces , cutting across by the village well and down by the Binnacle to the shore . They went into Nils 's fishhouse and stood there hand in hand in the close darkness smelling pungently of marlin , spruce laths , and paint . The Foss Campions were going by . Helen broke into uninhibited laughter , and Philippa began to tremble . She felt as unpredictable as a cat before a storm . Steve put his arm around her shoulders . " What 's the matter ? " he said close to her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessly , and turned her face against his jacket . He caressed the nape of her neck , rumpled her hair , and then smoothed it . Suddenly her eyes filled with tears . " Come on , " Steve said at last . " They 've gone . We 'll go rowing now . " Chapter 22 Philippa had always been amazed at the way the human personality could make itself accept the irrevocable . She had come to realize that the power of acceptance was a partner of the will to survive . If you refused to agree , with your whole spirit , that certain  | catastrophic events had already occurred , you battered yourself to pieces eventually against the brutal wall of your dissent . The thing happened ; in a matter of minutes your life was altering its flow around and over the incident . In fifteen minutes or less Philippa had accepted this new circumstance . But with an instinct for self-defense , she was trying not to think about it until she felt calm enough to sort motives and emotions into their proper places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve rowed down along the western side of the island . The land rose on her left , a long , massive black shape , saw-toothed against the gun-metal color of the sky and the pale glitter of stars . Tonight there were no coves or uneven projections of rocks . The shadow of the island lay on the water , and there was no telling where the water left of and the rocks began . It bore no relation to the sunny slopes where cranberries ripened , and ground sparrows flew up from tussocks , and the young spruces were brightly verdant at the edge of the woods . This was dream country , another planet . She could see Steve clearly now in the starlight . He did n't talk to her but seemed to have gone into another mood entirely . The little dory slid over the water as fast as he had promised , the white water bubbling and hissing at her bow . The oars dipped up cold white fire ; the blades were outlined with light and left luminous eddies behind . Once Steve said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . " The dory felt as airily unsubstantial as a mussel shell . She looked carefully over the side and saw a crowding , darting mass of silver arrows in the water all around and under the boat , " What is it ? " she whispered . " Herring . " " Is that what you see when you go seining , then ? Is that how you find them ? " She hunted eagerly for questions . Herring made a safe subject . " That 's the way . You should see them in the seine . Then you 'd know what molten silver means . " " It 's too bad to catch anything that can go as fast and look so beautiful . " He did n't answer that , and she was n't surprised . There was really no answer . He shipped the oars and got out his cigarettes . There  | was a swell , as quiet as the breath of a sleeper , and the dory was carried on it without a sound . From the end of the island came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his skin showed ruddy . He was glancing downward , intently , at his cigarette . But just before he threw the match overboard , he looked at her . She felt as if he had touched her . When the match had gone overboard , he did n't pick up the oars again . The dory moved quietly with the tide . " What are you thinking about ? " he asked . " Do n't say herring . I know better . " " I was thinking about you and me , " she said in a low voice . " I was wondering why it happened . " " Do you have to wonder ? Ca n't you just let it be ? " " I 'm sorry , " she said humbly , " but I have to understand my part of it , at least . Did n't you ever do something that seemed so strange and unpredictable  --  for you  --  that you were bewildered ? " He looked up at the black mass of the island drifting by . After a moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one thing I could n't figure out for a long time . It bothered me for about ten years , and then one day I let it go . " " Just like that ? " " Just like that . " " Why was it so easy to let go ? Had it worn itself out in ten years , lost its importance ? Or were you just tired of wondering ? " " I do n't know . After ten years I was still having dreams about it that brought me awake all standing . " He turned his head toward her ; she could see in the starlight that he was smiling . " But maybe the sting of it had gone . It was easy to let go , finally , because something had come along that there was no question about . " She loosened her fingers consciously from the side of the seat . " What was it ? " " You . " " When you say there was no question about it , what do you mean ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you ca n't ! " she said , desperately . " Love  --  what I call love ? is n't like that . It 's not sudden , it 's slow . It does n't hit you like a bolt from the blue . And even if it did  --  well , I have no illusions , Steve . There 's nothing about me to fascinate a man all in an instant ? "  | She stopped , and Steve said mildly , " Go on . " " I 'm independent , I 'm opinionated , I talk like a schoolma'am even out of hours . " Fleetingly she saw Young Charles glowering at her across the desk . " You 're a lot of other things , " he said . " You think they do n't show , but they do . Mrs. Marshall 's one person , but Philippa 's another . She looks out sometimes , past the mother and the widow and the teacher . " She did n't know what to say . His words enchanted her ; she could not help a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was actually happening to her . " You ca n't doubt me , Philippa , " Steve said . " I 'm thirty-eight . I 'm not Young Charles . You know in your heart that I 'm telling you the truth . It 's yourself you 're doubting . " " Why should n't I ? " He gave her no quarter ; he was using honesty as a weapon against her . " My husband has been dead eight years . He was the sum and substance of everything I 'd ever wanted . When I knew he was dead , I expected I would never be stirred by another man , that I 'd never feel even the faintest sort of physical attraction . I thought that phase of my existence had died with Justin . I was wrong , I know that . I must have thought I was superhuman . But now  --  tonight  --  and it started before tonight , if you want to know ? " she flung at him defiantly ? " I 've been shaken out of my common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't tell whether it 's you who has done this to me or the smell of your clean shirt ! " Her laughter sounded a little wild to her . Steve said , " I wish this darn dory was n't so tittle-ish , so I could move without drowning us both . What 's that about the clean smell of my shirt ? " " I noticed it the first time I met you , outside your brother Mark 's house . For a moment  --  well , it did n't exactly remind me of Justin , but of something , a mood or an atmosphere . It 's deceptive , ca n't you see ? " His voice was tenderly amused . " What happens when other men wear clean shirts just scrubbed and ironed by their loving women-folk ? " " Nothing , " she said unwillingly . She wished she could see him more clearly . The starlight was an aggravation . " Listen , my darling , " Steve said , leaning toward her . " The world is n't going to end tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts .  | I 'm not going to come down on you like Young What's-his-name out of the west and carry you off on my horse . " He took up the oars . The blades dipped with a whisper and stirred up fire . " We 'll go back to the harbor . I 've kept away from you too long . " The village was quick at putting itself to bed after the dance . There were no lights anywhere when they came into the harbor ; there was nothing to suggest that Gregg 's music had once soared out over the island like a bird . Philippa stood on the narrow strip of sand that appeared between Nils 's and Sigurd 's wharves when the tide was out , waiting while Steve put the dory on the haul-off . He came back to her then and put his hands lightly on either side of her waist inside her coat . She tensed instinctively , but without antagonism . " My clean shirt , " he murmured . " So that was it . I thought it was tweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was always different , " she whispered back . " Awfully homespun . " " You do n't feel homespun . " He put his arms around her all the way , under her coat , and held her close to him . As her arms went round his neck , she knew she must have wanted to do it the other time . He kissed her without violence but with a steadily deepening ardor , and her response came in a pure , free current . He lifted his head and said , " That was Philippa . " The words were a little unsteady . She stared at him in the dimness without speaking , knowing the new , soft unsteadiness of her mouth , the whole new defenselessness that would be part of her now . He turned her toward the little rocky path that led up between the fishhouses . They walked around the harbor in silence . Steve took her hand and laced his fingers through hers . There was something irrevocable about the entwining grip of bone and sinew , the warm contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' kiss , she thought ; she knew that even if there should be no more , this night could be enough to break her heart . At Asanath 's hack door they stood for a moment facing each other . An interrogative chirrup sounded in the darkness , and the firm , furry body of the yellow cat leaned against Philippa 's legs . She said gratefully , " Here 's Tom . " " Good night , Philippa , " Steve said . " Good night , Steve . "  | He did n't offer to touch her , but said softly , " Do n't go to bed and think . Dream . Maybe you 'll dream what you want to know . " He walked away quickly . The cat went into the house with her . Chapter 23 As the lamp flame grew in her room , she looked around at the familiar things , the tidiness that was at once chaste and fussy . She half believed that in the morning she would discover the interlude with Steve had become detached from her existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of self-deception brought on by the night . But sleep would have to come in between , and it looked as if there would be no sleep . Resolutely she relaxed each muscle and breathed deeply . She tried poetry , the sedative rhythms of " Evangeline " and " Hiawatha . " But fragments of verse she thought she had safely outgrown with her adolescence came winging into her consciousness like goldfinches across the fields . Ernest Dowson , Rossetti , Swinburne . Swinburne ! She laughed softly . How greedily she had devoured the pages out in the arbor or in bed at night by the beam of her scout flashlight . The words had scorched and intoxicated her . She had memorized things she barely understood , reciting the rich cadences as she walked to and from school , feeling that she lived an ecstatic life apart . But at twenty she had laughed at herself for the Swinburne episode . Why Swinburne now ? He was a ridiculous and unnecessary adjunct to a difficult situation . She sat up in bed , looking at the streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated wryly the words that kept plaguing her . Have we not lips to love with , eyes for tears , And summer , and flower of women and of years , Stars for the foot of morning , and for noon Sunlight , and the exaltation of the moon : Waters that answer waters . . . . She had n't known , at sixteen , what the poem really meant , but it did n't matter now ; the words were still lovely after all . Stars for the  | foot of morning , waters that answer waters . She heard the longdrawn rote , and a slight wash of water on the shore outside as the tide turned and the wind freshened . ... And like me The landstream and the tidestream in the sea . I am sick with time as these with ebb and flow , And by the yearning in my veins I know The yearning sound of waters ... . You 're still sixteen , Philippa . Sitting up in bed and reciting Swinburne . What about tomorrow ? Will Swinburne carry you through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down meekly and fixed her eyes on the brightest star she could see . Perhaps it would hypnotize her . Sleep would turn everything back to its normal level . She awoke at daylight , and Steve was in her mind before she was fully conscious . Nothing was detached . No perspective had shifted . She awoke remembering his fingers smoothing her hair and stroking the nape of her neck . She wanted to finish a letter to Eric , now that she was awake and had time to spare . But she felt ill at ease when she began to write , and eventually she put the letter aside . Routine had its uses besides efficiency . By the time school was under way , she felt almost natural again . There were no chances for reverie . Most of the children were tired from the night before , and a variety of small annoyances went on continually . Someone was forever being tripped by a foot thrust into the aisle ; pencils prodded the sensitive spot between the shoulder blades ; almost everyone sent to the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With no need to practice square dances , the older boys at recess began a campaign against the girls . Kathie and Ralph were after each other tooth and claw when Philippa discovered it . Though these two showed the greatest potentiality for damaging each other , the whole schoolyard was embroiled . Philippa dismissed the younger grades until the afternoon session and sent the older ones to the blackboard to work out some complicated problems . She was watching Rob 's heroic battle with his work when she  | heard the hiss of Peggy Campion 's indrawn breath and a choked spasm of snickers . When she looked along the board , everyone but Peggy was working hard , scowling intensely to indicate concentration , and with only a contorted stiffness of feature to suggest repressed emotion . Peggy stood back , chalk in hand . Her face was immobile . She stared at Ralph without blinking . Philippa walked to where Peggy stood , and looked at the board . Peggy 's numerals were always gracefully formed  --  they never soared up or staggered down ; they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word scrawled across them was as blatant as if it had been shouted aloud . Philippa looked at Ralph . The back of his neck became a rich red , contrasting unpleasantly with the bright color of his hair . The sound of his chalk took on a frenzied rhythm . Numbers appeared at a dizzy speed and with no meaning whatever . Then he erased furiously and filled the space with new figures . The rest of the class slid into a state of suspended animation ; heads turned as slowly but irrevocably as sunflower heads followed the progress of the sun . " Ralph , " said Philippa at last . Ralph 's shoulders jerked violently . He dropped his chalk on the floor , went down to find it , and came up with an incredible return of composure . " Ma'am ? " he enquired , looking like an eager spaniel . " Are you responsible for that ? " She moved her head toward the word . " Ayeh , " Ralph said . " Guess I am . " He looked at the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraising a paint job . " Yep , I did it . " " Any explanation ? " she asked coldly . Ralph scratched his head , looked at the floor , and then smiled at her . " Du n no as there is . It just come over me , sudden . Like one of them big waves comes up out of nowhere . " He snapped his fingers , and the rest gazed at his outflung hand . " I s'pose I had n't ought to 've yielded to temptation , like the feller says , " said Ralph , " but I did . That 's the way I am . " " What did Mrs. Gerrish do when anything like this happened ? " " Strap , " said Ralph cheerfully , looking at his hard-calloused palms . Philippa took a large sheet of paper from her desk and handed it to him .  | " Go to your seat , please , Ralph , " she said , " and write your word five hundred times . After you 've yielded to that temptation five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible . " Ralph gaped at her as if he had n't heard correctly . He took the paper gingerly , as if he expected it to burst into flame , and went to his desk . " You 'd better sharpen your pencil , " Philippa said after him . Moving like a sleepwalker , he went to the sharpener . When he had finally sat down , Philippa glanced at the class , and they returned to their own work . " Erase Ralph 's place , " Philippa said to Peggy , " and copy your work there . Then you can erase the other . " She walked over to the windows that looked out on the marsh and stood there watching the yellow grass rippling in the wind . There was a notable change in the atmosphere of the schoolroom . Some gazed at her in somber awe , others in confusion . In their experience , anyone who spoke or wrote such a word in the presence of an adult was strapped  --  usually by both teacher and parents  --  and sent off to mull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an Olympian tinge to it . There was no pain with it , but neither was there the excited admiration of friends who watched you stand up to the teacher and take your strapping with insouciance . It carried only the most stultifying of emotions , boredom . Ralph began his chore with a certain dash , but it was plain that his bravado was false . By the hundredth time and the third sharpening , he looked as if he were being forced to cross the Sahara Desert on foot , and there was still an hour of school to go . He regretted , too , the death of the word . It was like saying goodby to an old friend , not quite reputable but exciting and often very helpful . Never again would he scribble it or shout it with such an exhilarating knowledge of his own wickedness . After being written five hundred times , it would not even be a mildly bad word , just a dull one . The others knew it too , and so they looked at Ralph with a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise would have gone to Ralph . Philippa looked toward the harbor and saw the gulls . Their wings twinkled as they caught the sun . Perley came across the marsh with his shotgun in the crook of his arm and went up into the Bennett meadow . It was too rough for him to go to haul in his peapod  | today , or else he had his traps in to dry out and repair . In the fall the men set their traps in deeper waters . The boys who fished in fine weather from a peapod would go out with their fathers in the winter weather . Perley walked clumsily in his rubber boots , his free hand in his pocket , his head pushed forward ; he stared morosely at the path ahead of him . He was a lonely figure in the high-colored gusty day . Philippa could have been sorry for him if it were not for the Websters . She came back early to school after dinner and worked on her letter to Eric . She described the dance , the music , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dark , and how the water blazed when the oars stirred it , and about the herring . Again she was disturbed by a peculiar self-consciousness . But she took a resolute stand . The thing to do , she thought , as if she were setting someone else in order , is to remember that Eric and I are two separate persons ; if I want him to live his own life , I must n't be afraid to live my own . ... But in this case , it 's idiotic to think in terms of the future . In twenty-four hours this may have all died down to nothing . At that thought , meant to be encouraging , she felt a qualm like illness at the pit of her stomach . She put Eric 's letter away , finally , and considered the afternoon session . They might begin work on Halloween decorations ; they needed some sort of occupational therapy today . She heard the outer door open and shut with stealthy ease . Ralph and Rob must have been sobered by the morning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom drawer of her desk and find the patterns for the Halloween cutouts . When she straightened up , the inner door was open , and Rue Webster stood on the sill . She had young Daniel by the hand and the others were behind her , their pale pointed faces peering round her like background figures in a medieval tapestry . Rue looked at Philippa from exhausted eyes . " Come in , " Philippa said pleasantly . They came forward . Daniel looked around him and Faith had a spasmodic little smile like a grimace , but Edwin and Rue moved warily . They had thin sweaters over their clothes ; the little boy was fitted into a pair of dungarees made crudely over into his size . The legs were wide and clumsy , but at least his tender skin was not exposed to the weather .  | When they had reached the desk , they stood there in a silent knot . Rue 's eyes were ringed in muddy shadows . She lifted her hand to brush a lank strand of hair back from her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that her skinny wrist was braceleted with bluish-red welts . Philippa looked away quickly , but the girl pulled her sleeve down to her knuckles . " Where do you want us to sit ? " she asked hoarsely . " Where did you sit before ? " Rue jabbed her sharp forefinger . " I sat there , ' n ' Edwin over there , and Faith ? " " I sat here . " Beaming at Philippa , Faith slid into the seat . She wriggled around a little , as if to fit herself into a nest , folded her hands on the desk , and looked happily at the others . The seat belonged to the youngest Percy . " But that was your seat last year , " said Philippa , " and now you 're a grade ahead , so I think you can move back one row . " " I do n't know if Mis ' Gerrish gave us our passes , " Rue said suspiciously . " We 'll settle the grades later . Meanwhile we 'll arrange the seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwin ? " He was staring past her at the board . There was not the slightest flinch of perception when she spoke . " Ca n't he sit by me ? " Rue broke in rapidly . " Mis ' Gerrish would n't let him , because he was in a different grade and all , and she thought he 'd act up worse , anyway . But he 'd be a lot better if he could sit by me . " Color streamed into her meager face . Her tired eyes took on a sheen of intensity . Philippa said , " Sit down , Rue . Anywhere . Make Edwin sit down too . And then tell me about him . You know what he can do and what he ca n't do . " Rue touched Edwin , and he shook his head and went over to the windows . Rue sat down stiffly . " Edwin 's deaf , " she said . It was that simple . Daniel wandered around the desk , sucking a parboiled thumb . Philippa lifted him into her lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just us in my house . I never told anybody before now because I  | promised my mother I 'd never tell . Faith promised too . " Her colorless young mouth trembled slightly . " But I 've got to tell now , if we 're coming to school . Edwin 's been beat enough . I promised him nobody 'd strap him any more . " " That 's right , Rue , " Philippa said . " Nobody will . " " He acts so bad people think he 's either a devil or foolish . He started school all right , back on the mainland , and learned to read , and then after he had diphtheria he began to get deaf . We did n't know he was deaf for a long time . We just knew he got to be so awful acting nobody could do anything with him . First we thought he was born to be bad , and maybe took after Mamma 's brother that had to be put in Thomaston prison . But when we found out he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out flat and fast ; they had been shut up in her for too long . " Papa 's a good carpenter and he could pay a doctor . He wanted to take Edwin to Waterville or Portland , but every time he talked about it Mamma got so sick it scared him . " There was a fierce defiance in her ; she was shamed by the thing she hardly understood . " Papa tried to tell her there was n't anything to hide , but she would n't believe him . She thinks because Edwin 's deaf , he 's tainted somehow . " Philippa wished she could hold Rue as she held Daniel . The girl must have ached with her rigidity . Edwin stood by the windows looking out . " Was n't there anyone else who took an interest ? " she asked . " What about school ? " " They put him out , finally , because he acted so , and then when a woman came to talk to Mamma about him , and maybe find out what ailed him , Mamma got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of town right off , the next day . He did n't want to go , he had to leave his job , but Mamma wanted it . " Rue spoke relentlessly , neither lifting nor lowering her voice . Red blotched her face . " Edwin never went to school again on the mainland . Mamma told people in the new place he was n't bright enough to go . She said he fell out of his high chair when he was a baby and hurt his head . . . . helped him all I could at home . Then Can'n Charles hired Pa to come out here and work , and Mamma said it would be a good nlace to hide Edwin . " Her light eyes shifted toward her brother 's back .  | " I took him to school here , but Mrs. Gerrish did n't like him much . The kids plagued him in the yard about the way he tries to talk , but he could keep ' em off by plugging rocks at ' em . " Her mouth curled in a humorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she liked to work out her strap on him . Now I can feel kind of sorry for her . She was awful tired of this place by Christmas , and she thought Edwin was possessed to torment her . " Philippa stroked Daniel 's back with a steady hand , but inwardly she was shaken with rage . There was no need to ask if Mrs. Gerrish had ever called on the Webster parents . " I do n't hold with letting parents get involved in school affairs , " she had told Philippa . " As soon as you call on a mother , she starts telling you how Johnny is different from the rest , and then she 'll be dropping in every other day to make sure you 're treating him with the proper respect . " Philippa had laughed at the time . Now she wondered if Mrs. Gerrish would have shown more forbearance with Edwin if she had known he was handicapped . It was not likely . She would still have found him unmanageable . Perhaps he would be a problem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the window , set free from his tension by something he saw outside , a fish hawk beating its wings in space high over Long Cove . Thus relaxed , he was simply an undersized boy with a pinched , bony face and big eyes that moved with an animal 's preternatural swiftness . " How old is Edwin ? " she asked . " Eleven . " " And you 're sure you can take care of him in school ? " Rue 's smile was faint but proud . " Last year he 'd have been all right if she 'd let him sit by me . The way it is in a school like this one , after the teacher gets through with your class , you 've got plenty of time to get your own lessons and still help somebody else . We 'd have made out fine if ? " Her eyes shifted to a point past Philippa 's head . " If they 'd let us . " " Well , I think you 'll have a chance to show me how well you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and move Peggy back a seat . And Daniel can be the whole preprimary . " She sat the little boy down at the table in the corner beyond her desk . " Look , it 's just your size ! " she exclaimed in creditable surprise . Daniel was amazed at the coincidence . He wriggled around to look at the back of his chair and bent over to look under the table . He  | came up giggling . Philippa found a box of wooden beads in the cupboard and started a string for him . " Do n't forget me ! " Faith burst out of the silence she had kept long enough . " I 'm in the fourth grade now ! " " That 's no way to speak to the teacher , " Rue said sharply . " Her name 's Mrs. Marshall , and do n't you forget it . " She went to Edwin and touched him . He followed her to his seat . " You 'd better hang up your sweaters , " Philippa suggested . But Rue , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard over her wrists . Chapter 24 The return of the Websters was accepted with equanimity by the rest of the students . The Websters had left ; now they had come back . It was not an earth-shaking event . It would cause not the faintest tremor in the island alone . Ralph Percy gave Philippa an oblique glance that was oddly adult . Peggy Campion , at finding her desk moved , showed no emotion . She ignored the Websters as if their scrubbed poverty were repellent to her . Meanwhile Edwin and Rue , alike in their immobility , turned the pages of their new books . Daniel strung beads , gloating over the varied shapes and bright colors . Faith switched about in her seat in an excess of happiness . The younger children stared at her , and most of them returned her eager smile . She reminded Philippa of one of those homely white kittens with pale eyes and unbecoming splotches of fawn , who make up for their plainness by exuding a humble , ingratiating friendliness toward all the world . Kathie was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless she felt in a sociable mood and wanted to chat with Philippa before the others arrived . Now she tossed her jacket at its hook and went to her seat , her thumbs tucked in her cowboy belt . She wore a bright bluegreen silk kerchief knotted under the collar of her white shirt , and the wind had blown her yellow hair into its usual wild halo . She grinned across the schoolroom at Philippa , as one friend to another . Suddenly she saw the Websters at the other side of the room . She  | lifted an eyebrow at Philippa and called out , " Hi , Rue ! " Rue turned and smiled , and for an instant there was something shyly humorous and wise in her . Steve did not come that evening . He had promised to give her time to think . He had no doubts about himself . In another man it might have been complacence , but complacence did n't go with Steve any more than it had with Justin . She thought of Justin with affectionate detachment ; she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certain such a thing will never happen , how she would consider Justin if she should ever become interested in another man . But her theories had not gone very far . Now it had happened , and the matter was taking care of itself , which should prove the absurdity of theories , she thought . She went around the harbor in the early evening to drop Eric 's letter through the post-office slot . The store was open until nine o'clock , a place for the men to gather and talk ; the women often made a little ceremony of walking to the store in the evenings for ice cream or candy . An island was no place to take such things casually . Philippa had fallen into the mood and looked forward to her aftersupper strolls around the harbor . Tonight some men were torching herring from a dory in the harbor , and as they put more fuel on the dying torch , it flared up in a burst of glory . Wharves and fishhouses and the black squares of unlit windows were turned red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dory raced across water illumined to a bright , translucent green . The men in oilskins , two at the oars and one standing in the bow with a dip net , were like anonymous figures in a painting , and thus were touched with a sort of primitive radiance . Philippa stood outside the store watching until the cold breeze across the harbor drove her indoors . Mark Bennett sat on the counter , smoking his pipe . Randall Percy , a stocky red-headed man with a weak good-natured face , was playing checkers with Syd Goward . Syd was slight and graying , his hands tremulous from his last bout , called by courtesy migraine . Nils Sorensen sat beyond the stove , his chair tilted back against the shelves and his hands behind his head . They all spoke to her pleasantly .  | " Quite a sight out there , is n't it ? " Nils said . " It 's spectacular , " she answered . " It should be in a painting . I want to write to my son about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 'd ought to be a poet , " said Syd Goward , shyly ducking his brindled head . He had a small , meek face . " Then you could write it up like old Shakespoke . " Nils smiled . " Wonder if the old boy could 've written something elegant about the fragrance of those herring six months from now ? " " The only poetry that sinks real deep into his heart , " Mark said to Philippa , " is the number of lobsters that good corned herring tolls into his traps . " " I do n't notice you getting low in your mind when the lobsters are crawling , " said Nils . " You can stand on the wharf and earn your money while the rest of us are out pounding around . " " Who the devil looks out for the lobster car nights when it 's blowing a gale through this harbor and you 're snoring under the kelp ? I 've been down on this wharf sometimes and seen sights that 'd make you suck wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nils mildly . " You slave to make your millions . We know you do . " " Why , Mark . " Randall Percy tilted his glasses downward and looked over them . " I did n't know you was the family Croweesus . " " What 's that word ? " demanded Syd . " Sounds like somethin ' nasty . " Randall 's king took three jumps . His fat , freckled face was sad . " Just because it rhymes with Jesus is no sign it 's swearin' ' . " Philippa dropped her letter hastily into the slot . Mark caught the quirk of her mouth and said , " Songs and patter . Hear ' em free almost any day in the week . " He went to peer through the low window at the harbor . " Looks like Steve 's struck it rich out there , " he said . " Well , he 's a good man with a dip net . Those bean poles always are . Randall , here , he 'd have a stroke if he had to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there strainin ' your gizzard , " said Randall . Philippa said good night to them and went out . She moved to the corner of the store where the path began up the hill to the house , and stood there watching the harbor . No one could see her from the  | store . Steve 's name had been cut out from the other words to stand before her in a burnished solitude ; she had been unprepared for its effect , the sudden violent wish to see him , to be near enough to touch him , to reaffirm their intimacy . She had wished urgently for him to come into the store , in rustling oilskins spangled with herring scales . They would glitter on his dark face , too , and among the fine black hairs on the backs of his hands . He would talk with his brother and brother-in-law about the torching , and she would study the candy counter indifferently . But their knowledge of each other , unsuspected by the men , would lie strongly between them . The wind was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torchlight danced wildly . The sound of water splashing under the wharf was louder . She did n't know anyone was near until Kathie spoke behind her . " What are you doing , out alone in the dark ? " " Looking and listening , " said Philippa . Her poise , lost for a moment , flooded back . " I 'd never seen torching , or even heard of it , before I came to the island . There 's something tremendously exciting about it . " " Oh , sure , " Kathie agreed with more politeness than conviction . " But there 's more to see and hear , if you know where to look and how to keep quiet . " She chuckled . " Not as much as there used to be . I wish I 'd been here in the old days ! My lord , the things that happened when they were hanging May baskets ! " " How do you know what went on then ? " " Mark tells me about it . Then they all get talking over coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live a pretty tame existence , " said Philippa , " compared to the good old days . " " Jeeley Criley , yes ! Thirty years ago there were all sorts of actions going on . There was a woman used to live in the Binnacle ? " She sighed . " Well , all they do now is talk . But some of ' em can do the simplest fact upon in red ribbons and holly berries so you 'd hardly recognize it . " " That 's the way in all small places . " " There 's going to be a heck of a lot of packages going around with your name on , " said Kathie with what seemed unnecessary relish . " You tolled the Webster kids into school , and so you 've stepped  | on a lot of toes . Squashed ' em flat as those woolly caterpillars . " Philippa said pleasantly , " The Webster children have a right to come to school . Their father pays taxes and contributes toward my salary . Everybody knows that .... Are you walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Kathie . They started along the path . " Sure , the kids have a right to come . But rights do n't matter to some people , some who think the Websters should n't breathe the same air their kids breathe . They might taint it . " Kathie was waiting , Philippa knew , to be asked who these people were . She made one of the veiled ambiguous answers she herself hated . " I 'm sure everything will work out all right , Kathie . " " Ayeh , " said Kathie with cheerful insincerity . They stopped by Nils 's fishhouse and looked out at the harbor . The torch was out except for a falling shower of red sparks hissing into the black water , but they could hear men 's voices over the soft wash on the shore . " They 're through , " said Kathie . " They must have loaded the dory . She looked to be riding pretty low in the water . Well , I 'm going home . I was only supposed to go as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts . " I hope you 've got a good suit of chain mail to wear under your clothes , like Joan of Arc . " Philippa laughed . " Well , thank you , Kathie ! Good night . " She walked home quickly , wanting to pass the long beach before the men came ashore . Her desire to see Steve had gone out like the torch ; an instant of meeting could only disturb and get in the way of her thinking . When she had first known Justin , she had let herself go gladly , as if on a broad , delightful tidal stream . But Justin had been like the rock around which the stream was diverted , and now she was different . Chapter 25 Friday night Steve sent her a message by Jamie , inviting her to go to haul with him the next morning . She told the Campions about it . Asanath nodded benevolently . " That 's something you ought to see , and now , else you 'll have to wait till spring . Good days are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody comes here wants to go out to haul , " said Suze fretfully . " Like it was an excursion . What they can see in it , I do n't know . " " It 's local color , Mrs. Campion , " Philippa said . " Local fiddlesticks ! Going around in circles , rolling and lolloping , and the bait sinking . I ca n't hardly eat a lobster when I think of the stuff they eat ! " " Do n't you grieve about your weakness , Suze , " said Asanath . " You 're real brave when I bring in a mess . You always manage to choke down a few . " Suze looked at him uncertainly , flushing . For an instant Philippa guessed at the girl whom Asanath had married ; a creature with a fragile , tremulous prettiness like Sweet Alice . The quality had not ripened with the years but had become dried , insubstantial , and faintly acid . The morning was cold and sunny , with a little breeze to riffle the water and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be at Mark Bennett 's wharf at half-past eight . Most of the other boats had gone , leaving their skiffs bobbing at the moorings . Sometimes a gull stood nonchalantly on a punt seat , facing into the wind . Steve 's boat was still at her mooring , and he was busy in the cockpit . When she reached the wharf , Viola Goward and Mrs. Percy stood talking in the little sunny spot in front of the store . It was boat day , and they had come early to get their money orders and put in their bids for a share of the meat , fresh fruit , and vegetables that would come on the boat . They did n't see Philippa at once ; they were looking out at the harbor as they talked . Philippa glanced in at the postoffice window and saw Helmi working at her desk , her fair hair making a silvery glint in the dim little room . " Good morning , " Philippa called to the others . They turned hastily . Mrs. Percy 's dry , taut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then defiance . Viola laughed . " Good morning ! You 're just the lady I want to see ! " " I 'm flattered , " said Philippa cheerfully . Mrs. Percy sat down on the bench and took her cigarettes from a pocket of her leather jacket . She kept tapping one on the back of her hand . " I do n't know whether you 'll be flattered or not when you hear what I 've got to say , " said Viola heartily . " But somebody 's got to do  | it , and it might as well be me . I was never one to shirk my duty , and if there 's one thing I have got , if I do say so myself , it 's a civic conscience . There s some folks , on account of being islanders all their lives , who do n't know what it is to think of the community . " She showed her strong teeth in a smile . " With them , it 's every man for himself and the devil take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and brought out a lighter . " Dog eat dog , " she said in a shrill voice . Philippa pushed her hands a little deeper into her raincoat pockets , and set her back against a nearby hogshead . " This is going to be interesting , I can tell . " " There 's no need of me going all around Creation and half of Brighton , " said Viola . " If you 've been given the wrong advice , and been taken advantage of in your innocence , what 's happened is no fault of yours . " " Ignorance is bliss , " Mrs. Percy contributed , blowing smoke through her nostrils . " It seems to me I 'm being damned with faint praise , " said Philippa , or praised with faint damns . And why ? " Viola pounced . " Do you know what you 've got in your school , being allowed to associate with normal , healthy children ? " " I suppose you 're referring to the Webster children ? " " I am . " Mrs. Goward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Philippa thought . She 's going to slash away at me and my airs and graces , my insolence and stupidity . Aloud , she said , " But there 's nothing wrong with the Webster children , Mrs. Goward . I know they 're nervous , and probably undernourished . But they 're intelligent , and so far very well behaved . They belong in the school , and I 'm glad they 've come . " " But there 's things we know about that mess that you could n't know , " Viola went on with a show of patient generosity . " You 've had bad advice , like I said , or you 'd have waited to find out how all the parents felt . Some of us are fussy about our young ones , Mrs. Marshall , even if you think of us as just ignorant fishermen 's wives . " " I do n't think of you like that at all , " said Philippa . " It 's too bad you were encouraged to go stirring things up that are better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mrs. Percy .  | " Fools rush in , Mrs. Percy , " Philippa said . " That 's another good one . " With Viola Goward she was still gentle , with the softness of controlled anger . " No one gave me bad advice , Mrs. Goward . I 'm quite capable of making my own decisions and drawing my own conclusions . I did everything in my power to get those children back into school . It 's true , there are a few people on the island who were as horrified as I was to find them wandering in the woods like refugees , but they did n't know the situation until I mentioned it . " Out in the harbor Steve 's engine started . The sound was sweet , but she did n't look toward it . " Their father pays his share . They have a right to come . " Viola reached up to adjust a hairpin in the familiar violent gesture . " Rue is unwholesome . You 'll find out what I mean . You 'll find out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want my Ellie in the same room with him . " " I think I can control Edwin , " said Philippa . " Without a strap . " " Daniel 's under age , " said Mrs. Percy suddenly . " He 's not even preprimary age . You 're not supposed to be having a nursery school . " Surprised that Mrs. Percy could speak in anything but cliches , Philippa said , " I understood from Mr. Campion that the little children could come if the teacher wanted to bother with them . " The boat cut toward the wharf . Gulls flew up from the ledges in a strong beating of wings . Steve stood at the wheel , his thin dark face peaceful under the duck-bill . Philippa felt a sudden lift , as if inwardly she had gone up with the gulls . The day throbs with color and life , she thought . These women do n't matter , they or the things they say with their cruel tongues and their nervous ringing voices . Viola is like a sandy-colored wolf and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back on them and face Steve , they will cease to exist . She smiled at them with a generous friendliness . " I 'm going out to haul . I 've never been . It 'll be a lovely day on the water , do n't you think ? " She waved to them as airily as Kathie might have done , and went down through the long damp shed to the open part of the wharf . When they were going out of the harbor , Steve told Philippa to take the wheel while he put on his oil clothes . " Run out past the breakwater toward that spar buoy out there , " he said . " That 's Harbor Ledge buoy . " The answer of the boat to the wheel ran into her hands . She took  | a long breath . All her soul searchings about Steve were gone for the moment ; she was caught up and enmeshed in a purely sensuous response to the cold stream of air against her face , the shimmer of sunlight on the sea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mainland . Every new detail evoked more pleasure , whether it was the gull poised on the tilted spar buoy , or the sun shining on the buff-painted washboards and the green water boiling past . Steve reached past her finally and took the wheel , heading the boat down the side of the island . " You look happy , " he said . " I am . " " What was all that backing and filling for , in front of the store ? I saw Viola jabbing hairpins as if she was sticking a pig . " Philippa laughed . " Woman talk , Steve . Nothing more . " " I would n't have been surprised if Madam Goward told you she 'd stowed away under the forward thwart of the dory the other night . " " She did n't even drop a hint , " said Philippa . " So I guess she did n't think there was anything to find out . I have an idea that 's how she gets most of her information . She does it very delicately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly  --  she uses a different kind of fly for each victim  --  and they snap at it , and end up by giving their all . " " That 's Vi . " He put on a pair of white cotton work gloves and picked up the gaff . " The island 's had ' em before . They come and they go , and the island 's still here with never a dent to show where they 've been . " He steered for a yellow and white buoy , leaned out and gaffed it , and started the dripping warp around the wearpolished brass cylinder of the hauling gear . The warp spun tightly , flinging moisture in a bright shower , while the slack spiraled into a loose coil on the platform . The big trap appeared dimly in the depths , and then rose up to the side of the boat . Steve lifted it onto the washboards and brushed off the sea urchins . He reached over and gave the wheel a turn that sent the boat out away from the rocks , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take out the lobsters from the dark green , spiny tangle , he gave Philippa a sideways smile . " You 're no Jonah . " She felt ridiculously pleased , and said inanely , " That 's a help . " " Four counters . " He dropped the big ones in a barrel . Two were doubtful , and he measured them and found them legal . Three more  | went flying overboard , and the crabs with them . He took out the empty bait bag and put in a fresh one , bulging with herring . Another turn of the wheel , and the big boat , rolling a little in the brisk chop , circled to drop the trap approximately where it had been . Then as if with a leap of eagerness personal to herself , the boat headed for the next buoy . When they hauled around the western end of the island , they anchored in a little cove where the trees came down to the rocks in a thick growth . There was a family of old squaws paddling peacefully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing with the tide . They flew up when the boat came into the cove , but after the engine had stopped and silence flowed back over the dying ripples , the old squaws settled down again . It was out of the wind here and so warm in the noon sun that Philippa took off her kerchief and her raincoat . Far away , among the ledges that dotted the sea at half tide , other boats moved from trap to trap . She watched them idly , not wondering who was in them ; she sat quiescent in the sun and silence . Steve got out of his oilskins , washed his hands , and opened his dinner box . " Look , a tablecloth . " His dark eyes narrowed in amusement , and he spread the big napkin on the engine box . " Jo fixed me up for a lady guest , all right . Would you care to dine at the captain 's table , Madam ? " He set out lobster sandwiches and poured hot coffee into the thermos cups . There were filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the most beautiful meal I 've ever seen , " Philippa said . " I 'd like to take a picture of it . " " The background helps , " said Steve . " And the company . " He came around the engine box and sat down on the washboard beside Philippa . He took her hand and said soberly , " This is our first meal together . Supper at Joanna 's that time does n't count . Nothing had happened then . " " Our first meal , " she repeated . The laughter had gone . She looked at him without defenses . " What do you know , Philippa ? " He almost whispered it . " Tell me what you know . " " Only that this is one of the happiest days of my life . "  | " I think you love me , Philippa . " He put his arm around her . " I think you do . " He took her jaw in his fingers and turned her face up toward his . She wondered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they appeared , if the flurry of chickadee voices and the squawk of crows meant anything more than a hawk . But Steve kissed her before the wonder could complete itself . She looked into his eyes and saw the reflection of her own , lid and lash , against his dark chestnut-brown iris and black pupil . In this ghost of her , fragmentary and lost in him , there was an inescapable symbolism . For her who was shy and aloof to the marrow , it should have been intolerable . She tried for a moment to think that it was . Why , the man is a stranger ! she rebuked herself . But the shock and the withdrawal did n't come . She returned his kiss instead . Steve was no stranger . She knew now that he had never been a stranger . They separated with an outer casualness , only the flicker of a small , tender smile between them , and began to eat . Chapter 26 The week began with fog and cold southeast winds . The earth oozed moisture , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marsh , where the tough grass had worn thin , was sticky and spongy . The children tracked it into school , as well as the fine damp gravel from Schoolhouse Cove . On Monday the wind was strong enough and the sea fierce enough to have given most of the exposed traps a serious beating . Foss , Asanath , and Terence were discussing it in the kitchen before Philippa went downstairs that morning . She heard them through the register . They sounded neither depressed nor optimistic . With cynical humor they laid bets on how many traps they 'd have left of the strings set to the southeast of the island . The children went beachcombing before school and at recess . The seas rolled into Schoolhouse Cove out of the fog ; each rose in its towering greenish curve the length of the beach , and crashed with uneven thunder ; then there was the hissing and foaming on the shore , the churning of pebbles , the sound of gravel sucked out hard and fast as the sea withdrew to form again .  | There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading up the beach and sliding back . The children ran at the edge of the water like sandpipers , their voices small and tattered on the wind . When they came in to school , they were hoarse from shouting , their feet were wet where water had sloshed in over their boots , their hands were red , cold , and puckered . But their eyes were wild and shining . They were the wind 's children today , greedy , drunken , possessed . The back of the schoolroom was stacked with their loot . A broken toy boat and a buoy only a little damaged by someone 's propeller ? that was Jamie 's ; a pot warp , green-slimed but sound , that Sky Campion had cut from a smashed trap . He 'd also taken off what laths were left whole . Rue had found a short pine plank in the surf . It was soaked and heavy , and she and Edwin made slow progress up the beach with it , but they looked suspicious when Rob offered to help them , and struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For my playhouse ! " she screamed , and the other little girls looked at her enviously and then looked away , as if they coveted the teakettle too much to bear . Philippa heard Ralph telling Rob , rather too succinctly , not to lay a finger on the piece of manila hawser he 'd found . When he turned and saw Philippa he blushed , but explained : " Some people 'd steal the boots off your feet when you were sittin ' down , and then say to your face , Well , you was n't standin ' in ' em : " In spite of the ethics of beachcombing , it seemed that there were times when you could n't expect others to be incorruptible . After the first half-hour in school , when the warmth from the fire could exercise its gently persuasive spell over them , they settled down well to work . The Websters seemed to have fitted themselves into their own particular niche . Rue worked grimly . Sometimes she had an old , anxious expression , as if she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he watched Rue , the blackboard , and Philippa . He sat too tensely . Sometimes the cords of his neck stood out with the strain , and it was obvious that his teeth were clenched . Philippa 's own jaw and neck ached for him . He needed a hearing aid and lip reading ; he should have training to shape his crude , ugly sounds into words that would make him understood . But she could not even begin to conjecture how it could be accomplished .  | It was only when he read to himself that he relaxed . She decided to put off reading aloud until she could get a duplicate of the book for Edwin . His first penmanship papers were as neat as Rue 's . He could control his pen , and the ink did not jet mysteriously out of the inkwell onto him and his paper . Rob Salminen was hopeless ; Sky was average ; Ralph viewed his pen with aggressive suspicion , and at the end of a penmanship session his paper was speckled and fingerprinted , and Ralph was hissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the middle of the week she assigned compositions to all but the younger children . She wrote the usual list of suggestions on the board : The Season I Like Best , My Secret Ambition , My Favorite Place on Bennett 's Island , Pets . They could write the first draft of their papers at home , and copy them in ink at school . The fog continued into the next day . Violent wet winds blew in strong gusts into the schoolroom whenever a door was opened . The floor was damp with muddy footprints . The excitement of the storm had worn thin , the children were tired of it , and besides , there was nothing on the beach this morning . When the school settled down to work there was an undercurrent in the room . It was a familiar phenomenon . Every teacher has felt it , that ripple of unease too imperceptible at the first to quell but heavy with potential disaster . Philippa set the older ones to copying their compositions on white paper , and called the lower grades up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but inside the fire burned redolent of wellseasoned birch . There was the scratching of pens , the shifting of feet , a mutter from Ralph Percy , and a subdued flurry of snickers . Out of the corner of her eye Philippa saw Rob Salminen raise his hand to go out . She nodded at him . " Put on your jacket , " she said . The boy grabbed it off the hook and went out with it half on . A gust blew in , rattling papers and causing exaggerated shudders among the girls . A minute later Rob was blown in , gasping ostentatiously . Doors slammed behind him , the window shades flapped as if alive , and a handful of papers blew off Philippa 's desk onto the floor . She leaned down to pick them up , and in that instant the thud , the cry , and the uproar came almost simultaneously .  | When she straighter:ed up , with the certain knowledge that the day 's trouble had begun , most of the children were on their feet , gazing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight , seemed uppermost . Philippa had seen it before , on adult faces glimpsed in the light from a flaming house or circling a highway accident . Something had happened to break the monotony . Edwin still knelt in his seat with the heavy geography book in his hands . Peggy pressed her cupped fingers over the top of her forehead . She looked white and sick . Rue stood by her own desk ; she was as pale as Peggy . " Everyone sit down , " Philippa said to the rest . " What happened , Rue ? Why did he do it ? " Edwin moved around and slid down into his seat , still gripping the book . Rue came forward and held out the paper to Philippa . It was Edwin 's composition , half copied , entitled , " The Birds Around My House . " The white sheet had clearly been down on the muddy floor . The ink had run in places , the paper was smudged and wet , and marked squarely across it was the wet soleprint of a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush of suspense fell over the schoolroom . They had seen what had happened , or part of it , and she had seen none of it . Yet she must judge , and they were waiting . She glanced at Edwin , who stared back with light , brilliant eyes . Peggy also watched Philippa . The involuntary tears had cleared away , but her fingers still moved tenderly over her forehead . Rue said , " It blew off his desk and she stepped on it . It was delib'rate . " " It was n't . " Peggy ignored Rue and smiled contemptuously at Philippa . " It was an accident . " How neatly and symmetrically the wet rubber sole had been printed , to make a dark diagonal pattern across white paper and blue lines and Edwin 's meticulous writing  --  the writing he formed with a spellbound devotion as if it were his one art . " What makes you think it was deliberate , Rue ? " she asked . " Sure it was delib'rate , " Kathie said in a loud whisper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rue . " It was on purpose , " Rue stated flatly . " I saw . She stamped on it when he went to pick it up . She almost got his fingers . "  | " Rue , will you make Edwin understand that he must n't take the law into his own hands ? If he thinks someone is bothering him , he must let me know . I am the person to ask the questions and give out the punishments . " " He does n't think someone 's bothering him . He knows it , " said Rue . " Whichever way it is , I am still in charge . I know how Edwin feels . He 's worked hard over his paper , and he was doing it beautifully . But next time he 's to come to me . " Rue stood by her desk for a moment longer . Then she sat down , dipped her pen , and went on writing . Philippa went along the aisle and laid a clean piece of foolscap on Edwin 's desk , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the ugly mark . Philippa looked down at the rough whirl of pale hair at his crown and at the thin knobby neck . At least , she thought heavily , I did n't gush " Oh , I 'm sure Peggy did n't mean to do it . . . 1 " I 'm sure she did mean it . There was a red place on Peggy 's high forehead , half into the thick shiny hair . " How does your head feel , Peggy ? " Philippa asked . " Better , " said Peggy indifferently . Philippa went back to her seat and smiled at the awed fourthgraders . " Let 's read some more , " she said . She must not let the children know how angry she was . Chapter 27 School had just begun in the afternoon when she saw Helen Campion emerge from the lane and pass the big boulder outside the windows . In spite of the dense fog and rough raw winds , she was dressed as for a formal call in her good fall coat of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pheasant feather slanted recklessly . She passed by the window unaware of Philippa . Her face , fresh colored from the wet wind , was both troubled and determined . Philippa glanced around at Peggy . But Peggy was studying the history quiz written out on the blackboard , as if all that concerned her in the world was the meaning of " Fifty-four forty or fight . "  | In a moment Mrs. Campion 's firm step was heard on the doorstep , and the children looked up alertly . This morning there had been a crisis to enrich the monotonous passage of time . This afternoon , a visitor at school . When the knock came at the inner door , all heads but Edwin 's turned , and Philippa , in spite of a slight dismay , remembered Charles Lamb 's remarks on the drama of a knock on the door . The children and Charles Lamb understood one another . I must introduce him to them , she thought , and went to let Mrs. Campion in . " How do you do , Mrs. Campion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise ! You 're our first visitor . " Helen flushed . She gazed at Philippa with a strangely helpless expression . Philippa said , " Come and sit by the fire . " She led the way down the aisle . Helen followed her massively , but when she reached the front of the room , she ignored the chair Philippa offered . She faced Philippa across the width of the desk ; the effect of helplessness was gone . " I do n't need to sit down for what I 've come to say , " she said loudly . " It wo n't take long . " " I 'm sorry you wo n't sit down , " Philippa said . " We were all so pleased , thinking we had a visitor . " " There 's no call for you to be sarcastic . " Helen pressed her gloved fingertips hard against the desk . Her eyes , attractively crinkled and brilliant when she was laughing , now looked cold and small above her fleshy red cheeks . " You must know what I 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing as you 've some pets in the class . " " I have no pets , Mrs. Campion , " Philippa said evenly . " Then why did you let that Edwin Webster get away with practically knocking my girl out this morning ? " She turned and stared glassily at Edwin . There was a rustle through the classroom ; the children , all but Peggy , were fascinated . Sky was in Philippa 's line of vision . He was looking at his mother as if she were an interesting phenomenon of nature instead of a relative . " Edwin thought Peggy stepped on his paper deliberately , Mrs. Campion , " Philippa explained . " He should n't have struck her . He knows it now . He did n't get away with anything . " " Then why is he still sitting there , as if he was fit to mix with  | the others ? " Her voice trembled . " Why is n't he kept by himself where he wo n't be a danger ? He could have killed her ! She was scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying she wanted her seat changed , but she knew you would n't do it ! " Philippa was skeptical about Peggy 's fear but did not show it . She glanced around at the class . " Kathie , will you change places with Peggy , please ? " " Sure , " said Kathie . " Edwin and I always get along . " She began to take her books noisily from her desk . Peggy retired behind the lifted top of hers . " I did n't know Peggy was afraid , " Philippa said gently . " And she could have asked me to change her seat . " Somebody snickered . " Class , " Philippa murmured . The two girls arose , their arms full , and passed each other at the back of the room . Kathie was grinning . Peggy 's profile was haughty and immobile . As she took her new seat , her mother said emotionally , " To think I had to come out in this awful weather to see that justice is done for my poor child ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy . She returned their look proudly , but the blush began in her throat and moved up over her face , and Philippa was sorry for her . " I 'm sure you all have plenty of work to do , " she said reprovingly , and then smiled at Mrs. Campion . " Now wo n't you sit down and visit with us awhile ? " " No . This is n't over yet , Mrs. Marshall . You keep trying to make light of it , but you 'll find out that when we support a teacher , we 're not paying her to keep critters in the classroom that should be taken off by the state ! We 're making it so you can have a living and keep your own little boy  --  but if you had him out here , you 'd soon see to it that he would n't run afoul of the Websters ! " Philippa said coldly , " The incident is closed , Mrs. Campion . You 've made your complaint , and that 's your privilege as a parent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my pupils or on my personal affairs . " She walked down the aisle in a profound silence and waited at the door . Helen stood by the desk . The children were merciless in their avid curiosity . Her fine color became blotched , and she pressed her mouth into a small tight knot . Then with a defiant toss of her head , she  | went down the aisle . When she came to Peggy 's desk she stopped , and touched the bruise with conspicuous tenderness . The girl pulled her head away and went on reading . Mrs. Campion 's big face looked absurdly hurt , her eyes were swimming in tears as she came toward Philippa , but she managed to leave with dignity . Philippa opened the door for her and said , " Good-by , Mrs. Campion . " There was no answer . After a moment the outer door slammed viciously . It might have been the wind , Philippa thought charitably , and went back to her desk . She saw the pheasant feather passing the windows again . Peggy saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight past the boulder , and her expression was one of complete and unforgiving contempt . She had dramatized herself at home in the noon hour , Philippa guessed , but she had n't intended that her mother should visit school . She was humiliated now , and besides , she was probably sure that she could handle Philippa better than her mother could . She considered her mother stupid , and Peggy would never be able to excuse stupidity . Philippa 's own anger died quickly , and before the afternoon was over she had achieved a sort of pity for Helen Campion . By the time school was out , the fog had lifted , and the island lay bleak and dark in the dreary light ; the grasses looked dead , the woods sodden , the shingled roofs black with moisture . The tide was very low . The gulls picking around the refuse of old bait and fish entrails under the wharves looked chilly and desultory . Philippa came out of the lane by the Foss Campion place and saw Perley lounging in the fishhouse doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly hair and big regular features , without her passionate vitality . In consequence , when there was nothing to animate him his dark face looked sleepy and stupid . " Hello , Perley , " Philippa called . " Wretched weather , is n't it ? Is it going to storm ? " He was chewing on a match and now he took it out of his mouth , hawked loudly , and spat on the ground . He replaced the match and went on chewing . Philippa walked on past the boarded-up house . She would have liked to knock the match out of his mouth and slap his face . Then  | she was ashamed ; her response was as childish as his action . And what else was she to expect from him ? He suspected her , and therefore she was his enemy . She had seen his pursuit of the Webster children in the woods ; she had coaxed those children into the safety of the school . Nobody was home at Asanath 's . Suze had left a piece of apple pie on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . After she had tidied herself and put on fresh lipstick , she went to see the Webster parents . No one had cleared the spruces away from the front of the Webster house for several years . They pressed close around the porch , and their branches scraped the roof . Philippa walked under them , turning up her coat collar against the drip . She went up the steps and knocked at the front door . The silence around the place made her uneasy . Surely the children did n't go to their brush camp after school in this bleak weather . She shivered ; her raincoat seemed too clammy . She knocked again , and suddenly Rue opened the door . " Oh ! " she exclaimed . She put her hand up to her mouth . Philippa smiled at her and said , " I 've come to see your mother , Rue . Are n't you going to ask me in ? " " About Edwin ? " Rue whispered , and Philippa shook her head . " It 's just a call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stepped back and said huskily , " Come in . Be careful you do n't fall over anything . " Philippa went through a shadowy room oppressive with the raw , stale chill of a place kept shut up . Rue opened the door into the big kitchen , into lamplight and the scented warmth of a wood fire . The shades had been pulled down to shut out the dark day and the spruces . The big lamp on the table shed a kind light over the bare floor and cupboards scrubbed paintless . The children and the woman gathered around the paper-littered table and stared at Philippa as if she were an apparition . Then Faith shouted , drunk with excitement . " Hi , Mis ' Marshall ! " Daniel grinned around his thumb . Edwin gazed at her defiantly . I le had a pencil in his hand , and paper spread out before him . " It 's the teacher , Mamma , " Rue said nervously . Philippa had expected antagonism , or an obvious state of tension .  | She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from beyond the unshaded lamp . All her children looked like her , in the triangular face and wide-set light-colored eyes . But with her the eyes had a curious glow , unearthly in the lamplight ; her hair fell in an untidy tawny mass to her shoulders . She had her arms folded on the table so that her shoulders were hunched , and in her whole pose and the unblinking stare there was fantasy effect of youth . Rue looked older than her mother at this moment . " How do you do , Mrs. Marshall ? " said Mrs. Webster , smiling suddenly . She had a deep , hoarse voice . When she stood up she became tall , very thin and angular . The lamplight shining upward outlined the bony contour of her jaw and the strained slenderness of her long neck . She came around the table . " Wo n't you sit down ? " she asked . Rue pushed forward a small rocker . " You better take off your coat . It 's hot in here . " " Lovely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fire going . It smells so nice . " Rue nodded primly and arranged the coat over the back of a chair . The children went back to their drawing and coloring . The square table was a litter of old coloring books , sheets of used wrapping paper , and cut-open paper bags . They seemed happy and busy , shut into their lamplit cave . Mrs. Webster sat on a straight chair near Philippa and folded her hands in her lap . " I 'm so glad that you came , " she said with a meticulous respect for each word . " I 've been wanting so much to meet you . " " I owe you an apology for not coming sooner , " said Philippa . Mrs. Webster 's smile was constant , like a reflex . It followed a pattern ; she squinted her eyes into bright slits , wrinkled her nose , and then curved her mouth widely without opening her lips . Philippa guessed that her teeth were bad , and also that her nose-wrinkling must have enchanted people when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to me , Mrs. Marshall , " she said . " Oh , they are ! I enjoy them very much ! " Daniel was watching her soberly , and she gave him the ghost of a wink . He grinned and turned his head away .  | " Well , I enjoy them too , " said Mrs. Webster vivaciously . " You can see for yourself . Sometimes I play with them for hours , as if I was no older ! " Again the smile . She arranged her dress over her knees . Like the children , she was extremely tidy though everything seemed faded and outgrown . " Probably you think it 's silly , " she said . " I think it 's splendid , " said Philippa . " I wish more mothers felt that way . It 's a tragedy not to enjoy your children . " " Oh , it is ! " Lucy Webster refolded her hands in her lap , tightly . " We have a real snug little nest here . We do n't care what goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ! " The smile twitched around her mouth like a tic . " It 's a help to be able to do that , once in a while , " said Philippa . " Not too often , of course , but it gives you a chance to rest when things seem too much for you . " There was a faint darkening like a cloud shadow over Mrs. Webster 's face , and then she nodded her head and smiled fervently . But her eyes were different , a little distracted . Daniel was watching Faith cutting paper dolls from an old catalogue . His mother looked around her in a distraught way , and all at once reached out her long arm and caught hold of him , sweeping him against her side . The boy gasped in fright at the sudden swoop , and Philippa felt Rue 's uneasy stir behind her . " Daniel loves school . It 's so sweet of you to bother with him ! He 's lonely without the others , and of course when I 'm not well  --  you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed for days and days  --  I have n't the energy to move , but I have a wonderful hubby , the way he waits on me hand and foot , and such good darling children .... Sometimes I tell Rue she 's the mother and I 'm the little girl , she 's so efficient and I ca n't do anything , really ? " She stopped , panting , but the smile continued . Behind Philippa , Rue did n't move . Edwin went on drawing , Faith stolidly cut paper dolls , and Daniel tried stealthily to slide out from under her arm . But she was very strong . The bare arm was thin and sinewy . " You 're lucky to have Rue , " Philippa said . " I love my boy , but I wish sometimes that I had a girl too . " She wanted to leave , but she could not embarrass Rue . " Even Edwin 's a grand help to his silly mum , " Mrs. Webster  | burst out gaily . " Poor little Edwin ! Folks think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . His little brain stopped growing . I used to explain it to everybody and they were terribly sympathetic . Now I think they can just take him as he is , poor little addled chick ! Of course it was an awful thing for my hubby  --  he just ca n't bear to mention it , but I believe a mature person should face those things , do n't you ? " She fixed Philippa with a brilliant gaze . " I do indeed , " said Philippa . She stood up . " I 've enjoyed meeting you , Mrs. Webster , and I 'd like to come again some time . Perhaps when Mr. Webster is home . " " Oh , do ! " Lucy Webster cried . She released Daniel , who scuttled to the far side of the table beyond Edwin . The way she carried her lanky bony frame was a travesty of adolescence . " I 'll go to the door with you . " " No , mamma , " Rue said . " You stay where it 's warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother laughed and shrugged . She fluffed up her lank masses of fair hair with her hands . " You see ? She 's the mother ! " In the dark cold sitting room , Philippa said , " Hurry back to the fire , Rue . " " I 'm glad you came , " Rue whispered , " only ... well , you see what I mean about Edwin . " Philippa put her hand on the bony shoulder and felt it stiffen . " Edwin 's going to be fine , Rue , " she whispered back . " Do n't you worry . Between the two of us , we can help Edwin a lot . " The shoulder relaxed . Going down the steps , Philippa thought , Well , I 've committed myself . And God help me . I do n't know what I can do for Edwin or for any of them . Suddenly she remembered her resentment of them when they had first broken into her sight , that day in the orchard . She had resented them because she had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet brave in their fear , she would not be able to forget them .  | Chapter 28 Philippa woke in the night and thought of Helen Campion and Mrs. Webster . She tried not to think of them ; her consciousness slid to Steve and put her farther from sleep than before . She saw him against the darkness ; there was a movement of his lips , as if he were saying her name . When she was with him , it seemed to her that an entirely new personality had been set free in her , one with neither the wish nor the power to remain aloof . But apart from him she went on questioning her motives endlessly , even while her body was still warmed and invigorated by their moment of contact . She had n't known she could be so indecisive , and she tried to find reasons . I suppose at my age most women see all relationships with a view to permanency , she thought , lying in the chilly dark with the small wind crying past the window . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I trust it in him . It 's entircly possible that he 's an egotistical scamp trying to see how far he can get with an unattached woman . Yet I can believe with all my heart that he 's honest and still doubt myself . She slept finally , and when she awoke the wind had changed and brought a day with the texture of summer . The sea was an infinite and flowery blue . While she was dressing , Steve 's boat went out of the harbor . She saw him turn and glance toward the house , and she stood very quietly behind the windowpanes , as if he could see her if she moved . The practical thing , she thought , the obvious solution to be seized upon by a sophisticated woman , was to have an affair with Steve . She would find out then just how deep her emotions went . But she was not sophisticated . . . or perhaps she was . Surely it was only a very naive person who thought an affair solved anything . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told be at best a shoddy compromise . One became neither fish nor nor good red herring . She walked dreamily to school through the light-dappled lane ,  | her coat open to the morning warmth . The chickadees disputed her way in a noisy crowd ; she laughed at them , wanting to stroke their black caps with her finger . She was suddenly possessed with happiness , as if it had swept around her from the outside like the sun 's warmth or the delicate springlike aroma from the ground . The moment had an almost unendurable sweetness ; she knew it could not last . The day was a peaceful one in the school . The children seemed to be soothed by the summery atmosphere . She tidied her desk after they had all gone , not hurrying about it ; she had the doors open , and some of the windows , so that the scent of Schoolhouse Cove and the sun-dried sweet grass in the field could blow in on her . She could hear in the stillness the harbor sounds , boats coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulls ' faint but everlasting crying . Steve came so quietly through all this that he was in the schoolroom before she saw him . She looked up from her desk , and he was coming down the aisle . He smiled at her and did n't speak at once . His brown slacks and khaki shirt were freshly starched and ironed . Philippa felt at once mussy and smudged from her day in school . " You look simply beautiful , " she said . " Behold , the bridegroom cometh , " said Steve . " I could have come all scented up with bait instead of Red Maple . Maybe bait would be more virile . " " Dead Herring No. 5 ? " said Philippa . " Evening in Hogshead ? No , I like Red Maple very much . " Steve sat on the edge of the desk . " I 'll tell my niece . She gave it to me for my birthday , but she thought it would be wasted because I 'd never get near enough to a woman to let her smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had all time to spare . Philippa made a forcible effort to resume her tidying . " You 'll notice too , " Steve went on without hurry , " that I did n't take any chances . I put on a clean shirt . So if the Red Maple did n't work , the shirt ought to . " He looked down at her ; it was as if certain elements were focusing themselves into one powerful whole . " I 've come to ask you to marry me , Philippa . " She sat back in her chair , unable to speak . " But before I can expect you to answer , there 's something I have to tell you , " he went on quietly .  | She answered as quietly , " Why should you tell me anything ? I know that you 're sincere in this . " " Yes , and you know I 'm thirty-eight , one of six children , and a good lobsterman . " He was not smiling . There was an edge of white around his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shook her with its strength ; she wanted to take him in her arms . Whatever forces were at work in him , this was a moment in his life that was at once terrible and exalted . She was humbled by it . She said , " Listen , Steve , what do you know about me ? I 'm a widow , thirty-one , I teach school , I have an eight-year-old boy . " She smiled up at him , wanting to take the intolerable edge off the moment . " You know , too , that I freckle in the Bennett 's Island weather . But you know nothing whatever of me . I 've lived a whole life before I came here . I know about love and birth and parting and death , the entire cycle of existence , but that part of me is as mysterious to you as  --  well , the universe . I 've had all those very personal experiences with someone you do n't know and ca n't imagine . So what you say about my knowing you works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfect fragment of the other . " " We 've got a lot of talking to do , " he said . " Let me begin . " She sat forward , laying her arms along the desk and lacing her fingers loosely together . She determined to keep them loose . Steve did not move . She had n't known that he could sit so still . " Sometimes people have been amused or made uncomfortable to find my husband was a minister , " she said . " They 're the same way about clergymen as they are about undertakers . If a woman marries one , they think she has a queer , morbid streak in her ; they set her apart from themselves . " " Did that faze you ? " Steve interrupted . " I do n't believe it . " She shook her head . " I could laugh at them , and Justin could understand them . They did n't matter anyway . We had our friends and we had each other . . . . " She put her chin in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing Justin and hearing his voice , yet fully conscious of Steve . " You would have liked him . You 're something of the same sort . Wise about people , never shocked or surprised by anything that 's within the bounds of human  | nature . It 's the way a clergyman should be , and yet  --  have you ever noticed how some persons are so flustered and ill at ease in a clergyman 's presence ? They ca n't enjoy food , or talk , or joke . But if he were n't there , they still would n't be doing or saying anything out of the way . The biggest compliment they can pay is to say , You would n't think he was a minister at all : " Steve nodded . " Was he that kind ? " " I do n't know . I never heard it said . But there was always a crowd around him . We were at a little church outside Boston , and he was able to draw the young people to him without neglecting the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with him and take his hand . " Her eyes went distant again . It was a blurred , yet bright scene ; the drifts of yellow leaves on the lawn , the moving tree shadows blue across the white face of the church , the Sunday morning crowd , and Justin not quite distinct to her , a tall figure on the church steps in a black robe blowing in the October wind , the children running up the steps , laughing , and reaching for his hands . She had seen it so many times in sleeping and waking dreams , and always Justin 's face was blurred , but the black robe , the yellow leaves , the moving shadows , and the laughter of children had been the same . Suddenly , in this schoolhouse with this stranger waiting and listening , she remembered the first time she had seen him like this after they were married ; she had stood across the street , waiting for him , and someone spoke to her , an old lady of the church . " You must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , " said Philippa . She was too consciously radiant , as if she were making a picture to touch an old lady 's heart . But the truth was she had just received the frightening knowledge that Justin was not hers to keep . She had had , she supposed , what the older people of the church called an " experience . " But hers was the wrong kind , and she stood there trembling inwardly and fighting against the powerful , bitter sense of her own selfishness . The morning had been like the awakening into sense from a long and delightful dream . " Come back , " said Steve . He touched her cheek with his forefinger . " What arc you thinking ? " He leaned down to her , his breath brushed her forehead . " He never held his own child 's hand . Is that it ? " " Partly . "  | " What happened to him ? " " He went as a Navy chaplain , " she said . " It happened on Iwo Jima . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a hand grenade that did it . But the wounded man lived . He wrote to me . Justin had protected him with his own body . " " I used to wonder when I was out there , " said Steve slowly , " why it was . Why the man beside me , who had three children , and not me ? Why did some rats come through a dozen messes without a scratch when some men who could have made the world a little better did n't have a chance ? " " I wondered , " said Philippa . " I wondered for years . I used to try to think what I would tell Eric . I could say simply that his father was a hero , but what if he ever asked me if it was right to be that sort of hero ? Suppose he thought his father could have done much more in the world if he 'd saved his own life , so his heroism counts only as a senseless , foolhardy gesture ? " Steve 's mouth curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of reflexes . Look at the people who jump off bridges to rescue someone . Some of ' em do n't even stop to remember they ca n't swim . It 's a noble reflex , anyway . Better than pushing someone off the bridge in the first place . " Philippa laughed . " Well , so far Eric has taken it for granted . And by the time he does question it , if he does , maybe he 'll realize that the same questions have been asked for a couple of thousand years . I suppose that ever since the beginning of Christianity people have been saying , Why , if there is a God ? ' " She shrugged and spread her hands out on the desk and looked at them . " There 's never been a guaranteed , ready-mixed reply to that . You have to leave it to time to answer you . " " When you 're a kid , " said Steve , " time gets in your way . It 's too long to Christmas , too long to summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on time . " He stared out the windows at the wheat-yellow meadow stretching toward a white house mellow and assured in the sun . Without thinking she put her hand over his and held it firmly . " When you 're grown , " he went on in the same low voice , " you can say to yourself when you 're going through hell , Five years from now , I 'll be over this . At least I 'll be able to live with it . ' " She said , " What happened after you were grown , Steve ? "  | For the first time he seemed conscious of her hand . He held it between both of his for a moment , then laid it gently back on the desk . He stood up . " That 's what I came to tell you today , " he said . " I 'm married , Philippa . I have n't seen her for ten years , and I do n't know whether she 's alive or dead . " She was oddly shaken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a legitimate relationship with a woman , yet she was realizing that there had been a profundity to this experience that could still move him . But she would listen as objectively as he had listened to her , with no banal comments . " Ten years ago , " she said . " That would make it during the war . Were you away from home ? " " San Diego . " He lit a cigarette , not nervously but with a deliberation as if he were gaining time . " I met Vinnie in San Francisco . The details are n't important . Except that she was n't a pickup . " He gave her a somewhat diffident grin . " I was too bashful to pick up a girl . I 'd never had a girl , in fact . I suppose that 's one reason why this went so deep . " " What did she look like , Steve ? " He did n't answer at once , but looked into the smoke . She saw him adrift in San Francisco , skinny and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The women in the railroad stations and bars must have fed their eyes hungrily on his island bloom ; in the contrast between the strong , bony sweep of nose and jaw and the shy alertness of dark eyes , they would have seen a devastating mixture of maturity and innocence . " She was n't very tall , " he said at last , " and she had light brown hair , a little wavy . She wore it short when everybody else wore it long . She had brown eyes . Light brown and clear , like brook water . She had a kind of thin little face , like a kid , and yet too old for a kid , as if she knew and laughed at things , inside , that no kid should know . She wore the same old raincoat all the time and flat-heeled shoes . But it was funny , she 'd never go out without her lipstick . She could pull a comb through her hair and put on her lipstick all in a minute and look dressed up , even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not laughing at memories , Philippa thought , but at Vinnie ; he had evoked her so that she was no wraith . Dead or alive , she was very much alive in the schoolroom at this instant . Philippa  | imagined the young Steve standing shadowy in a place where all the light was concentrated in a mirror . He watched the tawny image of his girl luminous against the darkness . The comb through the curly crop , the lipstick across the mouth , and the eyes smiling at him from the glass , brook water catching the sun and reflecting it back at him so he could only have a blind instinct as to what lay below . He was speaking again . " She liked to walk at night in the blackout and the fog . She was crazy about the fog . She said she wanted to be lost in a Maine fog . She liked to cook spaghetti and drink wine with it , and have candles . " He smiled sideway , at Philippa . " I did n't blame her . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of cultch around . " " I like candles too , " Philippa said . " Perhaps I should warn you . And I 'm not what my mother used to call nasty neat . ' What sort of work did Vinnie do , Steve ? " " It was in an office , but that 's all I know . She did n't want to talk about it , even after we were married . She was an odd stick . It was always as if she did n't have anything but now , this minute , and the far future . She never had a day just passed , or a week or a year . I remembered afterward that she never once said anything about being little or having a family . There was n't a thing to prove she was n't horn twenty-four years old into that rackety little flat on a hill in San Francisco . But she could n't hear enough about my family and the island . I used to tell her she married me for what I came from , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me again the names of all the boats . ' She always started out by saying , When we go home to Maine : " He stopped and went over to the stove . After he had tossed his cigarette into it , he stood there looking absently at the woodbin . Is this the woman in his bones ? Philippa thought . Her hands were cold , but there was no way to get rid of the chill . She was tired , too . The night of the dance , the interlude in the dory , passed before her mind 's eye in a swift and wearying brilliance . She remembered the red apples shining like jewels on the engine box and the quiet intimacy that had been theirs . Now Vinnie was a sharp and moving essence between them . " What happened finally , Steve ? "  | " I was shipped out after a month . I 'd made her an allotment and changed the beneficiary of my insurance . I had n't told the family about her . We were going home together after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct look . " Sometimes you want to keep a thing to yourself for a while . " " Too many fingerprints , too many people breathing on it  --  you think it will lose its brightness . " He nodded . " Afterward I used to think if I 'd told them about her , maybe if I 'd started her off for Maine before I left , it might have anchored her . And then I 'd have the weirdest feeling that she would have gone into thin air halfway across the country . " He was not a man feeding on memories after all ; he seemed honestly puzzled . " She wrote three or four times a week for about six months . Then it stopped altogether . Things were tough where I was . I felt most of the time as if I was in hell with no claws . And I thought there was a mess with the mail . I kept writing whenever I had a chance , and I thought she was writing too , even if I did n't get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruining her eyes by candlelight . She had these ungodly big old candlesticks she 'd picked up somewhere , and she 'd have them on each side of her while she wrote . Said they made her feel medieval , as if she was in an old castle in Italy or somewhere , with walls five feet thick , and ghosts moving around behind her back . " He smiled at Philippa as if Vinnie were an endearing cntld they could both enjoy . " She sounds like a darling , " Philippa said . " Your month must have been a very happy one . " " Well , it was . And it lasted as long as the letters kept coming , and afterward , when I thought they were piling up somewhere and I 'd get them all at once . . . . Funny , I was out there two years , and I never doubted once that she was still there . " Philippa braced herself figuratively and literally . She put her elbows on the desk , her chin in her hands . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long , " he said ironically , " that nobody else in the house remembered her . They were all new , even the superintendent . I remember standing in that hall with them all looking at me as if I had battle fatigue and they should call the shore patrol . Sure you got the right house , Bub ? Try next door , huh , son ? ' Trying to ease me out . I kept telling them I was right , I kept hoping sonic-  | one would remember . Then the man who had the flat now , a thin little weasel with yellow teeth , said , She 's probably collected ten guys ' allotments and now she 's living in style in L.A. ' " " Did you  --  hit him ? " asked Philippa . He shook his head . " He was a little fellow , wore glasses . Besides , what he said did n't mean anything to me . Less than a gull hollering over a rotten fish head . " 11 He came back and sat on the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They think I 've lived like a monk , I guess . But you have to know . It 's like what you said about being married to Justin . Some- 11 one else has had a hand in making you what you are , and so in a way I ca n't explain  --  I have n't the words  --  he 's a part of you and I have to take you both . It 's the same with Vinnie . " " Yes , " said Philippa . " I did n't know where she 'd worked , so there was no one to ask . It was the strangest feeling , worse than being lost in the bay in a fog . 1 was surrounded by people , but there was n't one who knew her . She was gone . I had a crazy idea there might be a gravestone somewhere with her name on it , but I never found it . For a long time I had dreams about it , not just when I was asleep . After I came home , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , just as if she 'd suddenly appeared in the boat , and I 'd sweat and wonder If it had all been a dream  --  the flat , the marriage , the letters and all . .. If maybe it was battle fatigue that sent me up to that tenement to make a fool of myself . . . . I 'd heard of these fantasies people invent to get them through a spot they do n't think they can lick . I got to thinking maybe that was my trouble . " " You know it was no fantasy , " Philippa said . " You 'd like to think It was , probably , but you know it was n't . You know , too , that there Was a good reason why she did n't mention her past . She might have had a wretched childhood . She might have been an orphan . Perhaps she hated her work because it went against her grain  --  she was an artist in her heart and soul , I imagine . But circumstances had locked her into herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think she ran away from you , Steve . I think something happened beyond her control . It might have been one of several things , death among them . But you would have set her free . On this island she would have found everything she lacked . "  | " I kept the book open for ten years , " said Steve . He put out his hand and began to stroke her head with a gentle caressing motion ; he touched her widow 's peak , her temples , traced her eyebrows and the line of her nose . " I closed it because of you , standing in my sister 's doorway and watching the Webster kids . " Then he lifted her face and kissed her . " I 'm not a haunted house , if that 's what you think , Philippa . " " I do n't think that , " she said . But she was n't sure . First I doubt myself , and then I doubt him , she thought with a bitter amusement . But the feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers along her jaw resolved everything for now . She shut her eyes , wanting to sink into the moment as if into sleep . Chapter 29 She was working in her room that night when Foss and Helen Campion came to call . With her register shut and her radio on , their conversation was a blur , but sometimes Helen 's voice pierced through . Philippa had not met Helen or Foss face to face since the incident in the schoolroom . She had been disturbed by it , but there was no reason to suppose Mrs. Campion , once she had had her say , held a grudge . When her schoolwork was done , Philippa brushed her hair and put on fresh lipstick , and went downstairs . The silence began in the kitchen as she started down the stairs . When she reached the doorway , Suze Campion was already manifesting the wan confusion Philippa had seen so often ; she was hovering aimlessly around the stove , whisking off nonexistent crumbs with the turkey wing and trying to make the teakettle handle stand up straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared before her ; her face had become very red . The men , in the captain 's chairs drawn up to the stove , glanced around at Philippa . Asanath nodded . " Shut up shop for the night , have ye ? " " Yes , and I thought I was just in time for a mug-up , but I guessed wrong . " Asanath did her the favor of smiling . But Foss , who had  | never spoken to her without the caress in his voice that showed his affectionate toleration of all women , looked right past her . The intention was as tangible as a slap , and she felt a physical reaction she had not felt when Helen came to the schoolroom . Foss pushed back his chair and stood up . " Time we were pushing off . " " Do n't be in such a pucker to get under the kelp , boy , " said Asanath . " It 'll be no day to haul tomorrow . Full moon , flood tide , and easterly . That 's what it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Helen said portentously , " we should n't have come out tonight . Peggy 's so nervous lately . I 'm thinking we 'll have to take her to the doctor . " " If she starts developing headaches , " Foss said grimly , " there 'll be some actions around here , I can tell you that . " " Oh , dear , " Suze murmured . The teakettle handle fell down with a small crash . Asanath , sighing , pushed himself up out of his chair and went to the door behind them . Suze gave Philippa a distracted glance and followed . It was time that she talked with Asanath , Philippa thought . She sat down in the chair Foss had left , trying to ignore the murmur out in the entry . Once Helen 's voice rose shrilly , " I have n't forgotten it , Asa Campion , and I wo n't ! If your Terence was school age  --  and Vi said ? " The squeal dropped all at once , as if Foss had prodded her . What had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bothered Ellie . When Suze and Asanath came back , she said to him , " I did n't tell you what happened in school the other day , did I ? " He propped his foot on the stove hearth and sucked on a cold pipe . " No , you did n't , " he drawled . " No more'n you told me you 'd fetched the Webster young ones into the fold . I heard right off , naturally . But I thought it was a queer kind of actions , you not telling me yourself . " She said pleasantly , " Well , I did n't feel that there was anything to tell . " " That ai n't the way of it , according to my female relatives . They 've been yammering around here for a week or more , and they do n't show any sign of wearing out their lungs . They got more opinions than Congress conducting one of those investigations that cost us  | so much money . And it 'll be only a matter of time before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or against , it do n't matter , it 'll be a devil 's broth however you look at it . " He leaned forward and pointed his pipe at her . " Tell me something , my girl . What in the name of Jupiter possessed you to stir up a mare 's nest ? " " I stirred up a mare 's nest ? " She stood up . " Do you mean that ? " " Ayeh . " He watched her , she thought , with the stare of a marsh hawk on a high branch . She laughed disbelievingly . " It does n't seem possible that my interest in three harmless children should be the center of a storm . They should be in school , they 're coming to school , and as far as I 'm concerned , that 's the end of it . " " You 're either awful innocent , " said Asanath , " or as crafty as some say you are . " He shook his head . " Why you could n't let those kids alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out of your way to seine ' em in , and I ai n't had a minute 's peace since . " " Mr. Campion , " said Philippa courteously , " do you really think those children are n't fit to be with the others ? Or are you objecting because you 're being disturbed by the talk ? " " Waal . . . . Six of one and half dozen of the other , I guess . The kids are queer , and I do n't hold with the view that all kids are pure and harmless just because they 're under twenty-one . Neither should you , being a teacher . And for the other , well , in a place like this , small and cut off from the cont'nent , so to speak , if you have n't got peace in the community , you got nothing . " " That 's a very convincing argument , Mr. Campion . And nobody knows any better than I do that a child can be dangerous . I could tell some stories that would startle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told herself . He 's not your enemy , this should be a genuine exchange of ideas . She smiled at him . " I agree about peace . But what I ca n't understand  --  and maybe you can explain it to me ? is why there should be any storm and strife at all . These youngsters are odd , yes , but they 've never done any harm , have they ? " Suze burst out in a trembling voice , " What about that Edwin almost splitting Peggy 's head open ? " " I do n't suppose it 's the first time somebody 's been hit , with a geography book in that schoolroom , " said Philippa , " or the last . It was wrong , I admit . But if Sky or Rob had done it , would it have been a criminal act ? "  | " I do n't believe either of those boys has got criminal tendencies , " Asanath said ponderously . " With them it would n't lead to anything worse , most likely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even talk like a human being ! " said Suze . " Seems to me he 's a matter for the state and not for you , my girl , " said Asanath . She looked from one to the other of them . Suze returned her look , her light eyes swimming without expression behind her glasses , her mouth tucked into silence . Asanath filled his pipe , his expression mild enough . Between them , with less conscience and imagination than if Edwin had been a sick cat , they had disposed of a child . She wondered what difference it would make to them if they knew that Edwin was deaf . She could n't tell them , ridiculous as the vow of secrecy was . Besides , to explain would mean to go into the whole pathetic history , and still they would not understand ; they would only look at her and say , You see , they are all crazy in that house . Asanath tamped tobacco with a long forefinger and said on a yawn , " Ayeh , you 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us if you 'd left ' em running wild in the woods . " " Wild is right , " said Suze . " What kind of actions went on down there in that brush camp ? That Rue 's got a queer look . I would n't let her get near any child of mine . " Perley 's name was in Philippa 's mouth ; for a weird instant she thought she 'd said it , but they had not changed , they were waiting complacently to see her submission . It took all her will power to speak in a suitable tone . " Of course I realize now just what I 've done , " she said softly . " I can see that either I 've lost my sense of values or I 've never had a true one . " Suze did n't grasp the irony . She wore a look of greedy satisfaction , as if she were already framing the words with which she would describe the scene ; for once she would have something to tell Vi . Asanath put away his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not many folks who 'd own up to being a fool and a meddler , " he said . He had not missed her irony but had met it with his own . " Good night , " she said cheerfully , and went up to her room . She was a long time getting to sleep that night . Nothing had been  | said , actually , that had n't been said to her before . But this time Asanath Campion had said it . She had liked him from the first , she had liked him completely , and this made her sense of loss complete . Chapter 30 The next day was Halloween , and Philippa planned an afternoon of games and ghost stories . But the southeasterly storm had begun at daylight , and all morning the gusts of wind broke against the schoolhouse like heavy seas . The peak of the high tide would n't be until noon , but by half-past ten the water had passed the limits of a usual high tide . Ralph Percy had to go out back ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's coming in from the Cove and over the marsh from the harbor ! " he shouted . " Gently , Ralph , " Philippa began , but no one heard her . They were all at the windows except for Daniel Webster , who looked around from his table with his long upper lip drawn down as if he did n't know whether to be amused or frightened . " Come on , Dan'l , " Philippa said . They went to the windows and she lifted him up to see over the heads of the others . A sheet of water reflecting the sky 's lusterless gray was spreading over the marsh from the harbor ; the harbor was sheltered , and this shallow flood moved slowly over the grasses with no racing crests . Gusts of rain scudded across from Schoolhouse Cove . On the brow of the harbor beach , men splashed around in rubber boots and oilskins , starting dories out over the marsh . " The way Ralph came in and yelled , " Kathie said languidly , " I thought it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go look in the schoolyard , Miss ? " He rolled his eyes at Philippa and cleared his throat elaborately . " Mebbe you 'll see a little water there , enough to suit your Royal Majesty . Those old combers are coming right at the sea wall . Probably sweep us off any time now . " " Sweep us to where ? " Kathie asked coldly . The smallest Percy began to cry . Philippa , still holding Daniel in one arm , reached down  | to the child 's tense bony shoulder . " Look , Frances , they 're coming for us in dories . I did n't expect a boat ride this morning , did you ? " The younger children moved eagerly ; only Frances Percy was frightened . Philippa said , " No school this afternoon , I guess . We 'll have our party Monday , even if Halloween 's gone by . Come on , everybody , let 's get our things on . " She handed Daniel to Rue and tapped Ralph 's back . He came reluctantly from the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said briskly . " Now you can tell your little sister there 's nothing to be afraid of . " Ralph glared at Frances . " Gorry , if you ai n't the biggest bawl baby I ever see ! " Frances butted him in his solid middle without a word . The fright was over . They became busy with boots and jackets . A pleasant air of emergency pervaded the schoolroom . Almost everyone knew there was no real danger , but they could happily imagine that it was a thoroughly perilous situation . " Jeeley , we do n't get out tonight , " Ralph mourned . " What a Hal-loween ! " " I been saving a swell trick on Gregg , " Rob Salminen said . " Wish I 'd done it before instead of saving it for tonight . " Clare Percy burst out , " I hate this island ! I wish we 'd stayed in Limerock ! My father does too ! He do n't think it 's so wonderful to be a fisherman ! " " Aw , shut up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the rippling silver water . " Cheer up , Clare , " Philippa said . " After all , this is a real adventure . " Everyone crowded out onto the platform in spite of lashing rain and strong gusts ; there was no use in trying to keep them inside to await their turn . In the schoolyard the water swirled around the flagpole and lapped at the steps . Out in the marsh , where dead grass should have been , a sheet of water spread a blurring mirror to the sky . Nils Sorensen 's white lapstreak dory slid by a cluster of spruces and halfdrowned wild rosebushes . Behind Philippa there was a cry and a splash . She turned , still holding Daniel by the hand , and saw Kathie and Ralph down on their knees at the end of the platform hauling Faith up from the water . She was not crying , but she was drenched and shuddering violently . Her eyes seemed abnormally wide and black . Her old beret had gone and her pale hair was plastered , dripping , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own skimpy coat , but Philippa stopped her . She wrapped her raincoat around Faith , and Kathie , not speaking , contributed her wool kerchief for the wet head . Philippa tied it under Faith 's chin and looked fixedly into the child 's face . " What happened , Faith ? " Faith 's teeth chattered in a new crescendo of chill ; she did n't answer . Philippa looked around at the rest of them through the whip and bluster of rain . Their blankness infuriated her . " What happened ? " ? she asked it of them all . After a moment Kathie said , " I guess she was n't looking and stepped off the edge . " In the circle of Philippa 's arm , Faith was shaken by fierce tremors . She had been tripped or pushed ; it was as obvious as if she had cried it out . But no one would tell Philippa anything ; she belonged in another world , an adult world , a mainland world . If Peggy had done it , Kathie might catch her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to Kathie , but Philippa would not know of it . If Peggy had n't done it , who had ? She looked once more at the ring of entranced wet faces and was relieved to see the dory slide alongside the steps . Nothing was solved ; it was merely postponed . " Faith will go in the first dory , " she said . She handed the children down the steps to Nils , who lifted them in ; most of them were seabred , they sat without moving where he placed them . " We had an accident , " she said to him when it was Faith 's turn . He smiled at the child and said in his slow , even voice , " So you went for a swim , did you , Faith ? " Her lips moved nervously , but her eyes did n't change . She sat hunched in the stern like a small , bedraggled , and terrified bird . Jude Webster 's dory was already nudging the platform and came along to the steps as Nils left . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jude stood amidships , balancing awkwardly with his rain-streaked glasses in one hand while he fumbled with the other inside his jacket for a handkerchief . His oilskins were dirty , worn to the nap in some places and torn in others . The strap of his sou'wester hung loose , whipping in the wind . His eyes were narrowed as if they ached . Suddenly Philippa could n't bear his futile motions ; she was chilled to the bone , and Faith 's accident had disturbed her unpleasantly . She took a clean handkerchief from her blouse pocket and gave it to him .  | " Oh  --  thank you , " he said awkwardly , looking at her blindly from slitted eyes . He began to clean his glasses . His thin features had a classic cut ; they should have been scholarly and ascetic , but instead the whole effect was that of nervous indecision . When he put on his glasses again , his high forehead smoothed out . Ile spoke to the children mildly , rearranging them so he could take one more . Rue took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back washed and ironed , Mis ' Marshall , " she said . As her father took up the oars and pushed away from the steps , he raised his voice with some effort above a gust of wind ; it was not a voice for shouting down the gale . " I 'm sorry I was n't home the other day , Mrs. Marshall . I 'd like a talk with you . " " We 'll have one , " she called heartily . She wondered if all persons who seemed too heavily enthusiastic were driven to it by similar circumstances . Kathie and Ralph were left with her , but they did n't have long to wait before the third dory came to the steps . Young Charles shipped his oars and swept off his sou'wester in front of Philippa . " The gondola awaits . Do we have to take all those old retainers too ? " " I never go anywhere without my train , " said Philippa . " Climb aboard , then , and get situated . They can stow themselves around ye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes , meeting hers , were smiling and friendly . She had not seen him at close hand since the night of the dance , and the thought of his grievance had sometimes bothered her . He held out his hand to Kathie too , but she ignored it . " O.K. , Aphrodite , " he said . " Well , if it is n't Pistol Pete with the tissue-paper drawers ! " He slapped Ralph on his plump seat . " That 's fine , chummy , " Ralph said calmly , " but you do n't want to trust me to bag up for you next time you 're looking for free help . I can fix them herring so they 'll scare the lobsters ten miles away from your pots . " Charles grinned , and crowed like a rooster . " That 's a bantam , " he explained to Philippa . " We got an awful lot of ' em around here . " Ralph scrambled aboard , swinging himself into the stern . Charles first beached the dory in front of the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Ralph and Kathie climbed out .  | " By Gorry , we made it , " Ralph said , panting . " Once back there I thought we was going to swamp , but we had a good man at the helm . " " What 's he good for ? " asked Kathie , and they burst into raucous adolescent laughter . Young Charles rowed Philippa back across the marsh toward the flooded camps . They were blackened by the rain ; their steep roofs seemed to huddle like bent and shivering shoulders . There was no living thing in sight , only the rush of the wind , the slop of the high tide around the lower shingles and the bottom traps in the stacks , and always the low roar of the sea on the windward side of the island . Young Charles rowed the dory past the traps and went aground by the boardwalk on the other side of the camps . " Thanks for the ride , Charles , " Philippa said . " I 'm available with my dory any time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with an easy , sardonic defiance . " Special rates on dark nights when the water 's firing . " She ignored the reference . " Good-by , " she said , and set off around the curve of the harbor . Rain ran down her neck and pelted through the back of her suit , making her slip and blouse cling unpleasantly to her flesh . Her stockings were tight and cold . The wood smoke from Foss Campion 's parlor stove blew down on the wind , catching her in a sweet-scented eddy . The harbor waters surged around the rocks close to her feet , speckled with scraps of rockweed and dancing chips . She felt as if she were one of the chips , swept loose in a world of wind and flood . Because of the wind she did n't hear Charles running behind her until he was close enough to touch her . She swung around to him , startled and angry . His expression was at once resentful and strained under the narrow yellow brim of the sou'wester . " When are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusingly . " When you ask me . " She was thoroughly annoyed ; she had never been so cold in her life . " You 've never asked me . You 've never come to the house . " " And have Deacon Asa breathing down my neck , making homespun remarks ? But I 'll come . There ought to be a pretty day after this . "  | " All right , then , " she agreed , a little wildly . " On a pretty day after the storm . " She , added in a sudden burst of laughter , " Oh , go home , Charles ! We 'll both have pneumonia ! " He laughed too , excitedly , as if her half-promise had intoxicated him , and ran back along the boardwalk . Chapter 31 When the tide turned , the wind came off northwesterly . The rain stopped , but gale-force winds kept up . Sometime in the dark hours Gregg 's boat sank at her mooring ; she was a round-bottomed little craft with an exhaust pipe pointing straight upward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mark Bennett 's . Their mooring had dragged , allowing Percy 's boat to come down on Gregg 's , and a night of pounding had finally driven a hole in the small boat 's elderly planking . At least that was how the island construed it in the raw , wretched dawn of Sunday . Philippa walked around the shore and watched from Nils 's wharf with Joanna Sorensen while two dories , each with three men , went off to bring in Mark 's and Randall 's boats . The harbor was a heaving , bouncing mass of waves , tossed in by the strong northwester . To Philippa , it was an exciting battle of flashing oars and strong arms against the lifting white-capped waves . She caught her breath as Randall Percy watched his chance to leap into his boat from the small , prancing dory . When he was safe inside the cockpit , Philippa turned to Joanna , " Would n't it have been terrible if he had slipped and gone overboard ! " Joanna agreed seriously . " They 're really very sure-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from shore than it does out there . It 's when something like this happens in the winter that I hold my breath . When a northwester rips in here and everything 's covered with ice and they have to go out like this , it turns my stomach . That 's when I curse whatever it was that turned me into a lobsterman 's wife . " Philippa nodded but did not speak . This was an ordeal of which  | she knew nothing . Joanna  --  at first merely an attractive and vigorous woman  --  seemed to take on greater depth and stature every time Philippa saw her . " But it 's like having a baby , " Joanna was saying in an easier tone . She was holding Linnea on an overturned barrel and looked around her at Philippa , laughing . " While it 's going on you swear it 'll be the last time , but when it 's over you forget the agony . " She gave Linnea a squeeze . " Look at Gregg over there on Mark 's wharf . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always someone . " Gregg was a fidgeting potbellied figure stumping from one group to another , talking and gesticulating . " What will he do till he gets a boat again ? " Philippa asked . " He can go with Sigurd or Nils . For that matter , almost anyone would take him around to his pots . He 's lucky , he still has traps to haul . Jude has n't . He 's about the only man who has n't moved his traps offshore into deep water . " " What does that mean ? " " It means there is n't much left of them . In the last few days they 've been dragged on bottom and smashed to pulp against the rocks . The undertow does it . Nils said this morning they might as well be called a total loss . And I do n't suppose Jude has a cent put away . " Philippa felt sick . She was not seeing Jude , but Rue 's face pinched with understanding , and the mother 's voice going on and on in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to be sorry for Jude or not , " Joanna was saying . " He 's been in love with the island since Cap'n Charles brought him out here , but it 's like some hopelessly inadequate man being enslaved by a horrible and beautiful woman . Jude just ca n't take it , that 's all . Not forever . But he 'll keep trying . He 's got more stubbornness than brains . " " Maybe this is his deliverance , then , " said Philippa . " I do n't know . Nils says you have to let some people go on until their backs are broken as well as their hearts . He and Steve were saying this morning that Jude 's likely to break up over this like one of his traps . He adores this island . If only there was enough carpenter work to keep him busy . " In a little while Philippa walked home . She was depressed ; suddenly she wished that there was some place on the island where she and Steve could spend this long bleak windy afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking and dreaming ; she found herself aching for it . At dinnertime Asanath and Terence talked about Gregg 's boat . She barely heard them for thinking about Steve . How can we carry on with this , she thought angrily , if we have no chance to be alone ... ? She heard Jude Webster 's name then and came back to the kitchen , the darkly varnished cupboards , the smell of the boiled dinner , the pattern of the oilcloth on the table . " He 's a sick pigeon , " Terence said with neither satisfaction nor pity . " He looks like he 's been dragged through a knothole . " " He should 've stuck to his carpent'ring , " said Asanath , taking a wedge of cabbage . " Perley 's more of a lobsterman than Jude could ever be . " " He 'll get off here now , wo n't he ? " Suze did n't look at Philippa , but there was a barbed vivacity in her . " He 'll have to . " " It 's an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better to have it this way , no violence except from old Mother Nature . She knows how to take care of the ones that ai n't fit . " Terence grunted . His father went on . " I was hoping for something like this . There 's uglier ways of getting rid of a nuisance , but I do n't subscribe to ' em , myself . Though there 's some that do n't think much of the law . " " Who would bother a poor stick like Jude ? " Philippa asked . " And why ? He does n't take up much room . There seems to be plenty of ocean around here for everybody to fish in . " Terence did n't look up from his plate . Asanath laid down his fork deliberately . " Well , my girl , it 's like this , " he began . " The Bennetts walk down the road like they owned the earth , not just this island . And they do n't want any lame ducks flopping around and spoiling the looks of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flock of healthy ones does to a lame one ... ? The Bennetts might 've brought Jude out here to shingle some roofs and build somebody a new fishhouse , but they did n't figger on him staying around and being a liability and a disgrace . They do n't cherish him or his kids any more than the rest of us , but they 'll smile in his face and do the dirty work at night . " He picked up his fork and loaded it with food before he spoke again , gentle and smiling . " If an easterly did n't ruin his gear and run him off the island , something else would . Ever heard  | of Paddy 's hurricane ? And the next day the ones who did it would be as innocent as a nestful of newborn robins . And smug , too . They 'd preserved the peace and the fitness of things . " Philippa 's stomach contracted against the rest of her dinner . Bennett faces moved across her mind , vigorous , laughing , angry , contemplative . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Steve was the only one who showed a trace of subtlety . And yet Asanath could be right . He was an intelligent man , and he had lived here several years ; she had been here less than a month and had fallen in love with a Bennett . She had no moral right to judge . She said , deceptively agreeable , " It seems impossible that there could be people like that in this day and age . " " Oh , I know they 've made a good impression on you , " he said encouragingly . " That 's fitting , I suppose , since they 're all comely enough , and they 're the kind who 'll agree with everything . It 's yes here , and ai n't it a shame there , and they make you feel real fine and noble when you 're talking with them . They do n't keep a yammer going about things that do n't suit ' em . But they 're the ones , my girl , who think they made the law  --  or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to feel like little kings that do n't have to complain like common folks ; they just go out and do what comes into their heads to do , and the devil with the consequences . " Yes , it could be the truth he was telling ; but there was something else revealed too . Apart from her oppressive doubts , she was painfully disappointed in Asanath . She could not have believed , a month ago , that he was capable of such hatred . She had seen him as a survival of a leisurely and tolerant age , a mellow man . But it had been borne in upon her during that month that the island , remote as it was , was not free after all but contaminated by rivalries and resentments . She would cling stubbornly to one belief out of all the rest , that Steve was different , that he was set apart . She spent the afternoon walking around the western end of the island . If she could not be with Steve , it was best to be alone . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it claimed one 's whole attention . She felt as if she were standing in the center of a world of water and primal mists . As far as she could see , there were green  | waves tumbling ceaselessly after one another , like explosions of water thrown up from the ocean bottom . The long white crests of foam rode , broke , re-formed . There was a dull booming each time a sea hit a long dark reef nearby . The sun was bright between gray masses of rushing clouds . Gulls flew low over the waves and some small sea ducks rode on the surge close to the breakers . She watched them , wishing she did n't have to go back to the Campions ' . The argument with Asanath a few nights ago had been one thing ; this noon was something different . She did not want to sit across the table from him . But by all the laws of common sense she was bound to consider the significance of his words . Because of Steve , because she understood Mark 's angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nils  --  because of all this , had she any basis for believing Asanath was wrong about them ? She walked more slowly , and as she approached the village , she wondered how long it would be before the Websters , ruined by the storm , left the island . Then the rest could all settle back , as smugly sure as Asanath that the problem had been solved by an act of God . I No one would really be the victor , though of course Helen Campion would n't be able to forbear acting like one . I 'm getting to be horrid , Philippa thought . I should be relieved that my crusade is fizzling out so I can relax and go on pleasantly with my job . Finally she left the shore and went up through the brambly field to Mark Bennett 's yard , still sheltered and green within its surrounding spruces . She knocked on the back door and Kathie opened it ; a warm scent of wood fire and cooking flowed out past her . She said in honest excited pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was looking for permission to trespass , " Philippa said . Helmi Bennett 's quiet voice called from beyond , " Just in time for a cup of coffee . " " You 'll have to come in , please , " Kathie reached out and caught her by the arm , tugging hard . Her face was brimming with something that had been there when she opened the door , even before she recognized Philippa . " It 's a celebration . You 'll be glad of it . " Philippa went in , stirred without knowing why . Helmi was setting out cups on the big table by the windows that overlooked the  | island . There was no one else in the square bright room but her and Kathie and Philippa . She said , " The men would n't stay for coffee ; they had other things to do . You 'll have to help us drink it . " " Has anything happened ? " asked Philippa . Kathie tucked her thumbs in her belt as if she were confronting rustlers on her dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to buy Jude 's boat . They could n't even wait for the funeral , could they ? And Syd Goward had his eye on that dory that Mark let Jude have cheap ! " She laughed in pure unabashed exultation . " All it amounts to , " said Helmi , smiling , " is that Mark 's advancing Jude enough trap stuff for a good string , and the others will go good for it and help Jude get his traps built and set . Steve 's going up to tell him that if he wants to try again they 'll back him up . " " I 'm so glad , " Philippa said . She sat down gratefully . " I ca n't say how glad I am . " She felt almost rapturously happy . The warmth from the stove and the smell of coffee were sublime . Her troubles had not ended with the storm ; there was a prospect of more strife before there was less . After this pleasant interlude she must go back to sit at supper with Asanath . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall tell him to watch his language . But for now she was happy . Chapter 32 The wind stopped blowing so hard and life swung into its normal tempo . The men went out to haul in the mornings , and the women did their long overdue washings and hung out the winter clothes to air . It was early November weather ; a pale warm sunshine lay in a thin wash over the fields , the wind was cold when it caught one unawares , and if it dropped at sundown , by morning everything was thickly coated with a glittering hoarfrost . If the northern lights bloomed ghostly in the sky over Brigport , it meant a southerly spell . If a day warmed to an exquisite windless hush and the Rock appeared to float weightless between sea and sky , there would be an easterly spell . The days moved quietly in the school . Then , as she was picking up  | her papers one afternoon , directly after dismissal time , Sky Campion carne in again . His round face was flushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his black head . " Back to school already , Sky ? " Philippa asked him . " Short night , was n't it ? " He took off his thick glasses suddenly , and she saw his eyes without them for the first time ; they were beautiful eyes , wide-set and of the brown that seems almost purple and heavily lashed . They stared at her wildly . She felt the imminence of panic as if it were in herself . " What is it , Sky ? " she asked sharply . " Perley 's up there . " He pointed toward the Bennett meadow . " In the woods near the cemetery . He ? " He stopped , breathing in short shallow puffs with his mouth open , then wet his lips and began again . " He got it all fixed up with Peg , to ask Rue and Edwin to take a walk with her after school , and Peggy did . She was sweet as honey , she said she was going to be friends . " He was pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippa picked up her coat . She wanted to run out of the schoolhouse . Instead she said quietly , " Tell me as we walk along . Where are the other children , Dan'l and Faith ? " " Rue told Faith to take Dan'l home through the village because she and Edwin were going to take the long way home , with Peggy . She was pleased because Peg was nice to her . She did n't know which way to look , hardly , she was so pleased . " They went across the shaded schoolyard and into the late sun with its faint , deceptive warmth . Far beyond them , Rue and Peggy and Edwin were halfway across the Bennett meadow . Peggy 's red jacket blazed like rowan berries against the tall faded grasses around her . If I could lay hands on Peggy now , I would want to kill her , Philippa thought . She went on speaking , calmly , keeping her hand on Sky 's shoulder . " How do you know Perley 's waiting ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fishhouse . Perley gave Peg a dollar . But I did n't think she 'd do it . Lots of times she gets money off him and does n't keep her promises . I thought all afternoon she would n't do it . Then , after school , she started talking to Rue . " He shuddered violently , as if with a chill . Down at the harbor , men walked back and forth across the beach ; the faint wind carried fragments of voices , of hammers pounding .  | Philippa shook Sky 's shoulder . " It 'll be all right . Run down and get your father . " He hurried down the road . Up in the meadow the children had disappeared past a knoll of gray ledge and bay thicket . Philippa began to run . No stranger , she thought grimly , could imagine what infamy lay in this hush of bronze grass stirred gently by the wind and ringed with peaceful trees ; who could imagine Perley waiting in the thick growth beyond the cemetery ? This time , he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew what strange terrified noises he could draw from Edwin , but to crack Rue 's composure  --  that would be the challenge . The thought of Perley waiting in the woods was monstrous enough to put the taste of nausea in Philippa 's mouth as she ran . But at the same time she knew Peggy to be even more monstrous , for Peggy was intelligent where Perley was not . My Peggy is a sweet innocent little girl , her mother was always saying fondly . Beyond the knoll there was a lake of shadow cast by the woods . The three had just reached it , and for an instant the last edge of sun slanted across their heads . Peggy 's motions were leisurely and goodtempered . Rue pointed to a crow in a dead spruce . Edwin , a skinny slight boy in overalls , leaned down to look at something in the grass . Then they strolled on into the shadow . Philippa shouted Rue 's name and the girl turned quickly . In the blue glaze of shadow , her face shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained toward the woods , but Rue hung back , looking over her shoulder . " Wait for me , Rue ! " Philippa called . " Wait ! " Peggy was trying to run , dragging Rue and Edwin with her . She was a strong girl , and they were frail . But they had spirit , and Peggy 's sudden change of mood seemed to frighten them into revolt . If only Perley did n't come out of the woods to help . . . . The sweat burned in Philippa 's eyes . She knew she was covering ground , but it was like running in a bad dream where one stays eternally on the same spot . Someone pounded past her like a pony . It was Kathie . " Terence is coming ! " she flung back at Philippa , and ran on . She reached the shadow and went forward in a series of long leaps . Edwin had already pulled free and was pounding at Peggy with his fists . When  | she saw Kathie she flung Rue savagely from her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed the other girl out of sight . Terence and Philippa reached the children simultaneously . Terence knelt down where Rue crouched in the grass and took her by the shoulders . His hands were gentle , but there was no gentleness in his face . Philippa put her arm around Edwin 's rigid shoulders ; he ignored her , and kept staring toward the woods . " Perley 's waiting , is n't he ? " Rue said in a bemused voice . " I do n't know , " Philippa said . She sat down beside Rue , pretending to be merely companionable . Her legs ached and she felt weak . " I came after you because I wanted to talk to you about your work . " " You do n't have to make up a story , " said Rue . " I knew he was there when she started to pull at us . " She rubbed her forearm gently . Terence sat back on his heels and got out his cigarettes . " It would be easy to shoot him , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Philippa said . " There 's a way to handle these things , and we 've got to find it . Today is the end . " She spoke in a reasonable way , as if it were a quite ordinary problem . " Where 's Foss ? He should have come . I wanted him to see for himself . " " See what ? " asked Terence cynically . He blew smoke through his nostrils . " The only thing he 'd believe would be seeing Perley in the act of slicing off their ears , and even then he 'd tell you it was a mirage . . . . He 's coppering his boat back there . Sky came falling down the beach , crying , and said the teacher wanted him to come quick , it was about Peggy and Perley . " He watched Philippa over Edwin 's head . Rue sat in a little dream , rubbing her arm and gazing at the woods as if she did n't see them . " Foss laughed , " Terence said . " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Randall Percy was hanging around , and he said where Sky was all hawsed up about something , mebbe Foss had better go . " He stopped . " Well ? " said Philippa . " Foss looked around with that rotten grin of his and said , Trouble with her is she 's been livin ' alone too long : " She felt the color rising in her neck , spreading heat to her face . She ignored it . " So you came , " she said . Kathie came up to them , breathing hard . " Not a hide nor hair of ' cm , " she said grimly . " But I 've been thinking up a way to take  | care of that Peggy . Rob and I catch her on her way to Gowards ' after dark some night , and we haul her off in the woods way behind Mark 's , see , so nobody can hear her holler ? " Philippa had to laugh . It put strength into her and got her up onto her feet . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pract ical . We do n't want Terence carted off to Thomaston , and you put into a school for delinquent girls . " Kathie shrugged . " That 's where a lot of people think I should be . What was I doing today , instead of going straight home from school and doing chores for my auntie ? I was hanging around the beach where that Terence Campion was working on his engine , shameless hussy that I am . . . . Come on , Rue . " She hauled the smaller girl to her feet . Rue smiled in her odd , self-contained way . Edwin moved close beside her . They walked back across the meadow . The day had become very still . For a little while the world had resounded with cries and violence , and now the damp shadow had crept imperceptibly across the meadow , smothering the echoes to silence . The strange thing was that the whole drama had been enacted as if on a desert island . When they reached the shore , no one was left on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if waiting in silent agreement to make a decision . The smell of fresh copper paint blew pungently from Foss Campion 's boat . Nils Sorensen was rowing in from his mooring , and his son Jamie sat in the stern of the skiff . " Well , " Terence said , " what next ? " He stood with his hands in his pockets as always , but there was a change in him . Perhaps it was not a change after all , Philippa thought ; away from home , functioning as an individual rather than Asanath Campion 's son , perhaps he often lost some of his vagueness and became this sharply limned personality . " If you wo n't let me shoot the skunk , what then ? " " I think Rue and Edwin had better go home , " Philippa said . " Will you walk home with them , Kathie ? " " Sure thing . " Kathie put her arm through Rue 's . " Think up something real elegant now , like pouring gasoline over ' em and lighting ' em up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . " " You 're welcome , " said Terence , unsmiling .  | " Are you going to tell your father about this , Rue ? " Philippa asked . She frowned . " I do n't think so . It would worry him awful . He 's got enough to fuss about now . " " If you want to tell him , we 'll back you up . " Rue shook her head . In a queer way it was she who seemed to be most in command of the situation . " I do n't want to tell him . He just would n't know what to do , Mis ' Marshall . He 'd be about crazy . I can manage all right . " " I 'll help her manage , " said Kathie . " I 'll go back and forth from school with them . There 'll be no ambushes without a few broken heads . " Terence grinned , and Philippa said , " I believe you . " The girls and Edwin went off past the long fishhouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a faint rustle and a rattle of beach rocks from behind the traps stacked between the two camps , and Sky came out around them . At the sight of him , Philippa felt a jolt of desperation , almost as if she were ready to burst into helpless tears herself . At first he peered at the adults blindly through streaked glasses , until he took them off . His eyelids were thickly swollen , and the full childish lower lip had been bitten . " Is it all right ? " he asked thickly . " Yes , because of you , " Philippa said . She wanted to put her arms around him , but instead she took his glasses and blew on them and cleaned them with her handkerchief . The boy was sodden with his tears , and looked as if he had found no escape from misery in his crying . " You 're a quick thinker , you know that ? " Terence ran his hand roughly over Sky 's crew cut . It was too much . The tears sprang into Sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the point where he could control them . " My father did n't think it was anything bad , " he blurted . " That 's why he did n't come , honest . He does n't know about the way Perley is . He thinks it 's just teasing . That 's why he did n't come . " " I know that , Sky , " Philippa said . " If he 'd had any idea of what was going on , he would have come . " " I do n't want to go home . " Sky mopped his eye with his sleeve , but the tears ran without stopping . Terence gave him his handkerchief . " Battery acid got onto it once , but a few holes do n't matter , " he  | said . " You want to run away , Sky ? That 's what I always wanted to do . " Sky nodded vehemently . " I do n't want to look at Peg and Perley ever again . She would n't do anything , but she 's just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded again ? " just to get even with Perley . He 's always pushing rotten herring down my neck and pinching me on the inside of my legs where it hurts . " He swabbed his face with the worn handkerchief . " All I wanted to do was get even with him . But the whole afternoon I 've been thinking about how little and skinny the Websters are , and the things Perley can do to hurt , and Peggy making believe she was going to be friendly when all the time she knew ? " The word climbed and cracked . " And I do n't want to go home ! " Philippa handed back his glasses . " I 'm licked at this point . I ca n't think of an answer . Can you , Terence ? " He stood looking at the boy , his face thinned and old . " I could give you an answer , but it would n't do Sky any good . I 'm nobody to talk to a kid . Trouble with Sky is , he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other from under his red lids . Philippa reached for him instinctively , and then put her hands behind her back . " Terence , he 'd rather have you help him , " she said . " Oh , lord , " Terence said between his teeth , but he put his arm around Sky . Philippa went on past them ; when she had walked by Jude Webster 's camp , she was in full view of the Campion houses , and she wished at this moment more than anything else on earth to turn and walk the other way , to find Steve . But she could not in all honor do it . She had brought this upon herself ; if she had left the Websters in the woods in the beginning it would be no concern of hers what Perley did and that Sky was at this moment wretched and trembling . She must go to Foss about it , she knew ; she knew also what the answer would be . Helen would show the honest , understandable fury of the mother animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . Could n't she go beyond the stories of hysterical kids ? he would ask her silkily . He would be generous in naming Sky a liar . Sky was a dreamer , Sky was inclined to be underhanded . He would tell her all this .  | She had no logical reason for believing Foss would protect the others , including his stepson , rather than his own son , Sky ; it was simply that she knew . It would be less harmful , Foss and Helen would reason , to name Sky a liar than to admit that Perley might be a dangerous sadist . She could n't face talking to Foss now . She could not guarantee herself the proper behavior . Chapter 33 Steve came in after supper . At the sight of him in the kitchen doorway , she felt as weak and lost as Sky must have felt , coming out from behind the traps . She was tired from the afternoon , and meals with Asa and Suze were becoming a strain . " Want to walk ? " he asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't shown you yet . Shows up real pretty tonight . " " Just what I need before I settle down to arithmetic papers , " she said briskly , and went for her coat . " By gorry , son , " Asanath said , " there 's one thing ai n't changed over a thousand years and that 's the way of courtin ' a girl . Walk her out and show her the stars , that 's the brave boy . " " Maybe he is n't courtin ' , " said Suze , quite pertly . " No comment , " said Steve . " That 's what all the politicians say when they do n't want to start a rumor . " Philippa smiled in the darkness of the hall . She stayed there an instant longer than necessary , to keep the image of him in her mind as he had appeared in the doorway , wearing his big leather windbreaker and the dark blue ski cap . " Enjoy yourselves , " Asanath called after them . When they reached the bottom step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without speaking , he pressed it against his side as if he felt her need without words . Almost at the same time she felt rather than heard an approach , and a light flashed in their faces . Young Charles said , " All nice and cosy . " " Almost like having an open fire , " Steve said . His arm tightened  | on Philippa 's hand . " Take that bug light out of our eyes , will you ? " The light went out . Charles 's words moved toward them sullenly through the night . " So long . I 'll be going . Sorry I rampsed in . " " No , wait . " Philippa reached out and found the heavy wool of a sleeve . The arm braced against her touch . " Come for a walk with us , why do n't you ? " " Look , I 'm not Jamie . I do n't have to be pacified with a nickel for a bottle of pop . Forget I was here . It wo n't happen again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Philippa . She wished she could cuff him out of his tough , hurt patience . " Look , " Steve said suddenly , " I 'll go down to the shore and see a man about a punt . " He left them with a faint scrape of moccasins on dry grass . " What a guy , " Charles muttered . " Always the perfect gentleman . It 's enough to make me sick . " " I thought you and he were friends . " " We were . Well , now that everybody 's made such a song and dance out of it , I 'll tell you what I came for . I 've got to go to Brigport for salt tomorrow morning  --  Mark 's run short of it  --  and I 'm taking my father 's boat . You want to go ? " " I 'd love it . " He could n't keep the jubilance out of his voice now . " See you around eight , then . Night , Phil . " When he got a little way off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced the island silence , " Watch that Steve now ! He ai n't been the same since he came back from the Navy ! " He went away , whistling loudly . Steve came up behind her and slid his arms around her . It was as natural as breathing for her to lean back against him ; she shut her eyes and rubbed her cheek gently against his jaw . His arms tightened and she grew weightless within them . She felt that she could have stayed like this forever , cherished and hidden . But her natural pride canceled the weakness . It 's because I 'm tired , she thought , and straightened up . Steve released her and yet she was not released ; it was a facet of him that he seemed to relinquish gracefully and hold fast at the same time . His hand slid gently from her waist and caught her fingers . " Is Charles a problem to you ? " he asked . " Not in himself . But I do n't like him to feel the way he does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anger , these griev-ances ? " " He 'll live through it , you know , and be the better for it . " As they walked along , they heard his whistle , sweet and shrill from around the harbor . " That charm you mentioned has been a trial to his mother . Too many women go for it like drunks for a bottle . It 's been a tossup whether he 'd break a good girl 's heart or be ruined by a had one . So you , my love , give him a true mark to steer by . " " Thank you , Steve , " she said . They came to the Foss Campion house , whose lights shone out across the boardwalk and cast gleams on the restless water . The radio was on ; they could hear indistinctly a man 's voice talking fast and crackling bursts of laughter . She wondered what Sky was doing ; there had been no chance to speak to Terence later . She refused to think of Perley and Peggy , or even of Rue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clubhouse , " Steve said . " It 's too cold to stay out and look at stars . " " What 's at the clubhouse ? " she asked idly , contentedly . " A place to sit in the dark and be warm . Come winter we 'll have to marry up to get in out of the cold . " He laughed and put his arm around her waist . They walked through the village like this , out of range of lamplit windows . Gregg was playing a simple tender song like a woman singing in the night . They stopped and listened to it , not speaking , and then they walked on again into the lane . Steve had a key to the clubhouse . " One of the privileges of being on the Board of Governors , " he explained . " I can entertain my girl in here . Of course there are plenty who are n't on the Board of Governors who can still entertain their girls in the clubhouse , but they do n't come in by the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Philippa solemnly . " You come in by the door . " He swung it open and she walked in . Ile came behind her , turned her toward him , and took her into his arms . She put her arms around him and said softly , " Steve , oh , St eve . " They put records on the old gramophone and danced , kneeling on the floor to read the labels by match light . And once as they looked at each other in the light of the tiny flame , they leaned toward  | each other and kissed , and the match burned Steve 's fingers . He dropped it and it went out . But in the sudden blackness he caught at her shoulders and kissed her with passion . " Have you told your boy about me ? " he asked . " Not as a special person . But I 've mentioned you . " " Tell him then . " He was like a stranger in the dark , speaking in sharp laconic phrases . " Tell whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " " Yes , Steve . " " You 're devilishly meek all of a sudden . " " It 's the way I feel , " she said . He pulled her against him then , holding her tightly . He was so still she thought he was holding his breath . She could feel the heavy beating of his heart . Suddenly he set her away from him and lit another match . " Let 's dance again , " he said . The match flame leaped in tiny reflections in his eyes . He picked over the records and held one out . " ' Do I love you , do I ? ' " she read aloud , and looked across at him . " Dancing wo n't help any , Steve . " He did n't answer but took her arm and lifted her to her feet . He put the record on and they began to dance , moving like one person in the dark . Chapter 34 In the morning she was ready to go to Brigport long before eight o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she walked out on the point beyond the Campions . The yellow tom went with her , conversing in little wooing dulcet sounds as he jumped from rock to rock . It would be another fine day ; the sun was already warm though the frost was thick and slippery in the shade of the trees . The white houses on Brigport shone in the morning sun , and the fields sloping to the shore were warm bronze . She was thinking of Steve as she went down the twisting track among the spruces . She had been thinking of him more or less steadily since he had left her at the door last night . He was always in her consciousness now ,  | sometimes directly , and even when she was disturbed by something else , her knowledge of him was subtly reassuring . She had awakened early this morning remembering her promise to speak to Eric , and she did n't know how to begin . She had lain in bed watching the pearly light fill her room and rehearsed all sorts of openings in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is trite , if you want to niggle , she thought irritably . Why could n't I say simply , Steve has become a great friend of mine , and I 'm hoping you and he will become friends too ? She could imagine Eric 's clear gaze moving slowly between her and Steve . The relationship between her and the boy was about to be changed ; there was no question of admitting Steve into it . It would go , and the going would be like severing a second umbilical cord . " Rubbish ! " she said aloud . She had no right to conjecture about Eric and metaphysical cords when it was entirely possible that he would take Steve for granted and probably like him very much . Possible . . . but again she felt that faint inward quiver . How could you know a child ? How could you guess , beyond a shadow of a doubt , what they really were inside the fragile structure of bones and flesh ? As she approached the harbor , she saw Charles coming fast from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twitch of curtains in one of Foss Campion 's front windows , but otherwise there was no sign of anyone . Foss and Perley had gone to haul . The threecolored money cat sunned herself on the high rib of granite behind the house . The fishhouse was open and empty . She met Charles by the camps . " Coming to get me ? " she asked . " Am I late ? " His brief grin was like a muscular reflex . He stood with his hands in his pockets and his legs braced in aggressive fashion , as if he wished to bar her way . " What 's the matter ? " she insisted . " Is it too rough ? " " Yep . Too rough . " She did n't believe him . He looked at her too steadily ; his lips were pressed into an unnaturally stiff line . " What ails you , Charles ? " she asked curiously . " If you 've changed your mind about taking me , say so . I wo n't throw myself down and  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything of the sort . " His chest rose on a breath of exasperation that did n't get by his tight mouth . A dark blush flowed upward under his skin , and his eyes glistened suddenly as if with water . She put her hands in her pockets and watched him , perplexed and compassionate . " Shall I go back home ? No , on second thought , 1 'll take a walk around the harbor . I see Steve has n't gone to haul , maybe he 'll be more sociable . " She moved forward and he made a motion to stand in her way ; then he stepped off the boardwalk , but he fell into step beside her as she started on toward the long fishhouse . As they came to the giant fluke of the great anchor that had been imbedded in the earth above the beach so many , many years ago , she stopped and took hold of his arm and gave it a little shake . " Something is the matter , Charles . What is it ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold stream of wind all bows pointed northwest , and the dark blue water seemed to rush past the wet , rounded white or green sides of the boats . The big lobster boats rolled gently ; the little skiffs jounced up and down on the water , and a gull perched on the bow of one suddenly launched himself into space with an effortless outward thrust of his wings . " Look at Steve 's boat , " Charles said . " That 's the matter , if you want to know . " Once she looked , she wondered why she had not seen it before , for now she could see nothing else but what had been painted on the white side of Steve 's boat . Crude and gigantic , the words and the drawings were nevertheless plain . " Teacher and her pet " captioned caricatures of Philippa and Steve . She laughed suddenly ; the sound surprised her . " What a thing to call Steve , of all people ! " Charles stared at her , shocked and disbelieving . " Is that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I say ? It 's so  --  so foolish , somehow . " " You 're a cool one , " he said grudgingly , as if he felt his delicacy on her behalf had been wasted . " You cool enough to start off to  | Brigport with me , in the face and eyes of all this ? " She did n't answer . An effect like delayed shock was creeping into her . She looked at the boat across the water , her face growing stiff and cold . The words were mocking but innocent ; the caricatures were recognizable but not essentially more cruel than caricatures usually are . It was a silly , childish prank . At least it should have been . But as she looked across the bright dancing harbor , the great black lines sprawled against all the day 's clean brilliance had an inevitable ugliness . And worse than the ugliness was the size of the hatred behind it . It was frightening but not in a physical sense that one could fight . The rocks shifted under Charles 's boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a-hold of the critters who went out to haul early this morning and let it stand . Somebody should 've gone and got Steve to tend to it . I suppose they thought it was funny . " He brought out a crumpled pack of cigarettes and lit one as if it were the first after a long and exhausting mission . In the heavy silence between them he blew out smoke and stared at the harbor . Then he said , with a restless motion of his head , " I hope you do n't think just anybody did that , Philippa . Although I did it once . " His expression was a mixture of bravado and embarrassment . " The woman was a fool , though . I was drunk and I thought it was a wonderful big joke . But when I saw it in daylight , I was ashamed and sorry . And the poor guy had to bring his boat in and clean her up , with everybody throwing wisecracks around like ? " He took another deep pull on his cigarette . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em had gone around with her  --  he just happened to be the one of the moment . " " I do n't think the wisecracks will bother Steve , " Philippa said . " And I do n't have to hear them . " She sounded quieter than she felt ; there was a stiffness to her lips and a churning in her stomach . Suddenly she wondered if anyone were looking from Foss Campion 's , if they could see Steve 's boat from there , and what they were saying to see her like this on the beach , staring out into the cold wind . The thought of eyes avidly watching was more terrible than the words and pictures . " I lay it to either Terence or Perley , " Charles said .  | " Not Terence , " she said quickly , turning away to rest her aching eyes with the sight of the russet marsh grasses bending toward the east . " Why not ? " Charles said belligerently . " He 's too blasted quiet to be natural , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . " " I 'm not asking you , I 'm telling you . It may be Perley , but it 's certainly not Terence . " He shrugged . " Have it your own way . Are we going to Brigport ? " " We should , should n't we ? " She smiled at him stiffly . " But I think not . I do n't feel as excited about it as I did , somehow . " He could understand this ; she was acting now as he expected her to act , and his voice gentled . He touched her lightly on the shoulder . " Sure . Take a rain check on it . There 'll be other good days . I 'll go up and get Steve . " He looked out at the boat again . " If he was a fool or a coward , that 'd be one thing . " He shook his head and walked away . Philippa went across the marsh to the schoolhouse . She would sit on the worn steps and collect herself , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schoolhouse yard and stopped involuntarily as she stared at the white , wide-paneled door . The violence of the black strokes stood out even at this distance . So they had done the same thing here , too . " Teacher and her pet . " And the drawings . The lines seemed to breathe a palpable malevolence , bathing the schoolhouse in an aura of evil . She thought if she went inside , its familiar chalky and firewood scents would reassure her , but she could not bring herself to touch the door . Her squeamishness in turn dismayed her the more . She turned her back on the door and sat down on the steps to watch the gulls circle over the cove . It must have been a half hour later when Steve came . He set down the can of white paint and looked at the defaced door . " Well , " he said , " seems as if they thought it bore repetition . Good thing I brought my paint can along . I 'll give it a coat after I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one before she spoke to him . Then she said in a tone of wonder , " Why did they do it , Steve ? " " Might have been because we were up at the clubhouse last night , dancing in the dark . "  | " Do you think someone was following us , to see what we ? " She broke off , horrified . The island night had had such a primeval purity with only the sea sounds , the stars , and sometimes the shifting specters of the northern lights . As if he guessed at her horror , he took her hand and laid it on his knee and covered it firmly with his . " Things like this have been done before . Kids looking for deviltry or full to the gills with stories they 've read . Or women with nothing better to do , and bored . If you can get something on somebody , it can liven up things for a month . " " I 'm afraid whoever looked in the clubhouse windows last night must have felt severely cheated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his paintbrush . " She smiled at Steve and he gripped her fingers hard . The determined ease went out of his face . There was a frightcning quality in his silence . He got up and took the paintbrush from the can . " I 've already done the boat , " he said . " Now the door . " She stood watching him , her hands in her pockets , her collar turned up against the wind , feeling no warmth in the sun on her back . She thought of the moments they had had together , the bits and pieces of time they could call their own ; last night in the instant when the match had gone our , she had gone past all doubt and wondering . Afterward as they ( lanced in the dark , she had realized that what she felt for Steve was not an echo of anything she had experienced with Justin ; it was unique , it belonged to the Philippa she had become since his death . She had known instinctively it would have been impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought . It could never take the place of the first ; it could never exist without the first , and yet it is an absolute and perfect thing in itself . That was last night . But this was morning . Each of the other meetings had been an instant set apart from time , like a pebble of rose quartz separated from the others on the beach to be cut and polished into a gem . This morning the glint was gone . The attack had been made on her and Steve together , and whatever action they took would be given an undeniable significance . To ignore it or protest it , it did n't matter ; all the cans of paint in the world would n't wipe out the hostility . Steve painted without looking around , and she felt cut off from him . He cherished the way of living that had made him almost an  | invisible man , and now she had brought this upon him . The attention of the island was on him now , not casually , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't matter . The joke was on him . She wondered how long the chuckles and comments would last along the beach , and her anger sprang up strong and savage , in a desire to do physical violence to any who would dare hector him with their mockery . But she knew even as she felt it that it was futile . Instinctively she straightened her shoulders and smoothed her features into aloofness , to meet the change that must inevitably come to his . He said suddenly , still without looking around , " You told Charles you thought it was Perley . Any particular reason ? " Taken by surprise , she almost stammered her answer . " Yes . " Then she told him in as few words as possible , undramatically , what had happened , beginning with her discovery of Perley in the the paintbrush across the top of the can and turned to her . " What made you figure on keeping this all to yourself ? " he asked brusquely . " Where was I supposed to come in ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim because I 'm the real object of the attack . " She managed to keep from sounding apologetic . " There 's such a thing as keeping too quiet . It could have been something worse than this . You 're too blasted independent . " " As a hog on ice , my family always maintained . " She realized weakly the source of his anger ; it was not with the smear at all but with her secrecy . It was rather a domestic issue , as if between man and wife . She said eagerly , " Steve , listen . Without proof , I could n't talk to the parents , so I felt in all honor I could n't mention it to anyone else , even you . Do n't think I was n't tempted . I ached to drop it all in your lap . But that would n't solve anything . All I could hope was that when I had these children safe , in school , the trouble would have a chance to fade decently out of existence . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to walk into that house and hurl the truth at them like a pail of ice water . But how could I ? Had I seen Perley hiding in the woods ? How could I prove Peggy was n't be-  | ing sweet and generous to some little ragamuffins , who are vicious liars if they say Perley ever tormented them ? The children themseIves knew better than to start a row . The Websters were hounded out of school last winter , and not one child in that school told anyone about it . They just wanted to avoid trouble . " The skin was drawn taut over Steve 's cheekbones . His eyes had a curious glitter she had never seen before . She went on , " Have you ever tried to talk to the parents of a boy like Perley or a girl like Peggy ? If you had thirty pages of proof in black and white , they 'd throw it in your face and revile you ! Foss would n't come when I sent for him , and he did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile of traps . They 'd tell me Sky was lying or even worse  --  they 'd bully Sky into saying it never happened . " She leaned against the building , out of breath . Her throat was dry . He stood looking at her from under his lids as if he had never really seen her before . " I can understand why you did n't want to throw a match into the brush pile , " he said slowly . " And that 's what this place is . But good Lord , woman , the mess stinks to high heaven ! I 'm not going to wait until Perley hurts the kid to do something about it . How much proof do you have to have ? Kids marked up with cigarette burns ? Broken bones , or an eye put out ? " There was an undramatic violence in him that amazed her ; she had not thought him capable of it . " What do you want to do ? " he asked . " If you could handle this the way you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rue does n't want her father to know ; she says it would drive him crazy , and I think she 's right . Kathie walks back and forth with the Websters , and there 'll be no long trips around through the orchard . And as for this ? " she glanced at the door ? " I suppose I 'll ignore it . At least nobody will get any satisfaction out of seeing me squirm . What about you ? " " I put on some paint and act as if it had n't happened . " He pulled off his work gloves . Suddenly Philippa felt unsteady and her eyes burned . " Steve , I feel responsible  --  I brought this on myself , I know , but I did n't think what I would do to you ! " The words burst out . She had no control over them . " I came to this island , I loved it at first sight , I met you ? "  | " And loved me at first sight ? " His mouth curved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbances ? " she protested . " Look what 's happened to you because of me . " He put his hands on her shoulders and gave her a little shake . " Listen to me . You did n't start anything . There never was peace here . Leaving the kids out of it , there still would n't have been peace . Oh , sure , all the talk 's been involved with the kids , I know . The Campion women brought along some of their mainland ideas , and according to them , any youngster who does n't seem right should be shut off from the rest . The way we 've always done out here , a kid who was downright feeble-minded could go to school , if he was harmless . There might be something he could learn . And as far as plaguing them in the schoolyard , that 's been done to other kids , and if the teacher did n't bother , it was just too bad for the victims , unless they went home and told their parents . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Foss reacted yesterday . The things Asanath says about my stirring up a mare 's nest ? " " They probably mean just what they say , as far as the Websters are concerned . They hate to hear the women yammering , and you 've started them up in good style . So the men do n't bless you for it . They probably do n't think anything 's really hurting the Webster kids ... nawthin ' to get riled up about . . . . " He drawled it out like Asa , and grinned at her . " But as for the other business  --  which did n't have anything to do with the kids in the first place  --  that springs from the fact that the Campions moved on here thinking it was El Dorado and found themselves pretty well surrounded by Bennetts . They 'd like nothing better than to take over . Asa said in the store one day the island had had the Bennett religion long enough ; time they showed us what the Campion religion was like . " " And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " They do n't bother us any . They bought their places here , and they do n't look as if they 'll become public charges . We 've seen ' em come and seen ' em go . Why should they matter to us , as long as they do n't haul our traps or become public nuisances ? We were here before they came ; we 'll be here long after they go . If Young Charles 's father was here , he might needle the Campions a little , just for the fun of it . But the rest of us are pretty peaceable . "  | She said thoughtfully , " Still , I can see why you make Asa 's hackles rise . That air of careless power can infuriate . " " You would n't think Asa would be that easy to infuriate , would you ? But he 's been head of the Campions for so long , I guess he figured on being the Big Man out here . Probably thought this handful of Bennetts had gone to seed , intermarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took out his cigarettes . " But this business with the kids may give them a good chance to prod us up . Jude 's a Bennett man ; we brought him out here and set him up , just as Foss brought Randall Percy . It 's only a matter of chance that Young Charles is n't trying to fuss up Randall , by the way  --  just to raise hell and to annoy the Campions a little bit . Randall 's easy to fuss up , he 's scared to death of lobstering . But he 's also Fort 's father . So Young Charles wo n't plague him . " " What about the Campions and Jude ? " she insisted . " You do n't mean they 'd condone anything that happened to Rue ? " " Oh , not that . I told you , they do n't think there 's anything to it . They told you the kids were feeble-minded . If you had believed them and ignored the kids , that might have driven Jude of sooner or later . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , and the space he takes up with his pots does n't amount to Hannah Cook when the island territory is practically unlimited . So they do n't worry about competition from Jude , but it would be one for their side if they drove him off . I do n't know if you see what I mean . " " I do , " she said quickly . " It would n't be much of a victory in a material sense , but it would be symbolic of something . " " That 's it . You 've fallen head first into island politics , Philippa . " She glanced at the newly painted door . " Is that island politics too ? " " If that 's proved to be Perley 's , the Campions will be properly horrified , but underneath they 'll see it as an extra prod at the Bennetts . They wo n't be too shocked . " She said slowly , " I can understand the strain between the two families . That 's more or less natural in small places , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I ca n't stand thinking the children are going to be drawn into it . " She felt cold and very tired . " I can understand how both things started . Maybe Helen and Vi would have realized after awhile that Rue and Edwin were all right , and the business with the Websters would have died a  | natural death . But now ? " She kept looking at the door ; it seemed to her she could see the letters through the paint . " Now they 've come together ; and each supplements the other and makes it far worse . It 's not pleasant to think about , Steve . " " You do n't have to think about it . After all , you said yourself a war of nerves is a natural state of affairs in most small places . It does n't make the Campions any worse , or the Bennetts any better . We can all take care of ourselves , and nobody really wants a feud breaking out . It 's just island politics . " Unexpectedly he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . He kissed her forehead and her eyelids with the faintest gentle brushing of his lips . She held her face up to him silently ; she was quivering inwardly , as if at the end of a long race . Chapter 35 Rob was doing well with his fractions , Philippa thought . She put the last of the arithmetic papers away and stood up to stretch , walking lightly across the room with an instinctive desire to make no sound . Whenever she caught herself like this , putting her feet down as the cat Tom did , she was amused ; it was something that had come to her in the Campion household , where they were all so silent in their movements . It was not the cat 's natural stillness but caution , as if they were treading on explosives . She wondered how it had been before Elmo died , if he had been a loud , happy , vigorous force in the house , making them all so conscious of him that they had forgotten themselves . Now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some dreary terrain of acrimony and resentment , and they could find no frontier by which to escape . Terence was knitting trap heads down in the kitchen . Asanath and Suze were in the sitting room ; the fatalistic tones of Asa 's favorite commentator droned up through the ceiling . She wondered what Terence did when he was out . There were not too many evenings in the week when Gregg was sober enough for a nondrinker to want to sit in his kitchen . Kathie 's aunt and uncle were strict about her studies and bedtime . What did it leave for Terence , except to stand  | in the lee of a fishhouse , to smoke and stare into the darkness pricked by mainland lighthouses ? The shocks of the morning had retreated safely into the distance allowed for dreams . She had gone through her day as if unconscious of the blatant black letters standing between her and the rest of the island , as if no one were staring at her back , snickering or shaking a head in sympathy . She had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest for the mail boat to come . Joanna Sorensen had invited her to come in for coffee in the afternoon . Helmi had come too , and as the talk reached back into the past , Philippa sensed the solidarity that held these people , their unconscious assurance , inherent as the circulation of their blood or their ability to breathe , that this place was theirs . There was a timeless quality in the way they spoke ; their memories began in the island , years before the Campions came . No matter where they went , they would always be islanders . This was what the Campions hated . This was the source of the frustration behind their calm smiling eyes . They 'd been able to buy property on the island besides their own houses ; they owned the boarded-up house intended for Terence and the Percy place . But land and shore front were n't enough , Philippa knew , and she had a curious sympathy for them . A person could live out his life and go to his grave with his bankbook showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intangible ... . Now back in her room at the Campions ' , she thought that she heard voices outside . Sometimes the wind made queer sounds around the windows , and she went on with her writing . But there was no mistaking the heavy tramping on the back steps and the agitated opening of the back door ; voices were raised , Terence pushed back his chair , and Asanath turned off the radio and went out into the kitchen with measured steps . Philippa stopped typing . Helen 's voice rose by shrill stages to a passionate crescendo , and Viola 's cut vibrantly across it . The men 's tones mingled deep and unintelligible . Someone came out into the hall ; she recognized Asanath 's step again . He called to her . She opened her door and went out to the head of the steep straight flight , and looked down at him . He was half in light from the kitchen , half in darkness . The melee went on beyond , and Helen was crying hysterically .  | Her first thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps . She felt slightly ill . " Has there been an accident ? " she called down to Asanath . " Nobody 's dead . But you better come down , my girl . " He cleared his throat . " They seem to think it 's some of your affair . " Philippa started down . Her hands felt clammy and her heart was beating rapidly . She wished she could go back to her room and close the door , but that would have shut out nothing . It would be waiting for her tomorrow , whatever it was . Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow . . . . She was astonished to find herself silently quoting the phrase in time with her feet on the stairs . Terence came out from the kitchen . " Do n't drag her into this , " he said angrily . He stepped in front of Asanath . Philippa stopped with her hand on the newel post and looked from one face to the other . Asanath smiled . " She 's got a right to defend herself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Philippa asked . " Somebody just put the wood to Perley . Gave him a hiding over on the beach . " He blew smoke from his nostrils . " The fools think you put a gang up to it . " " I think I 'd better see about this . " She stepped down , but Terence stood in her way . " Do n't you be a fool . Go on back upstairs and let ' em stew in their own juice . " His face had the hatchet look she had seen before . " I ca n't put it off , do n't you see ? " she said to him . " It 'll come up again and again . " They stood facing each other in an interval of silence laid against the confusion in the kitchen . Asanath stood behind them , defied and ignored . Past Terence 's shoulder , Philippa looked into the brightly-lighted kitchen and saw Suze , the teakettle in her hand , staring down the hall . She realized then the appearance of intimacy between herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foss was leaning over Helen , holding a glass of water . He straightened up when Philippa came in , and looked at her stonily . Vi was leaning against the dresser with her arms folded across her chest ; her strong thin lips curled back from her teeth in a smile of anticipation .  | " Well ! " she said . " Here 's the lady herself . " Helen whipped the wet cloth from her eyes . " You ! " she cried in a thick , choked voice . " What 's the matter ? " Philippa asked . " Matter ! " Helen exclaimed . " Matter ! How can you stand there staring at us all so innocent ? " Foss stroked her quivering shoulders , murmuring soothingly , but she shook him off and got to her feet . " What about the gang you and Steve Bennett put onto my boy ? Lying in ambush like a bunch of heathen savages , and him coming home with the blood streaming out of him like a stuck pig , and so sick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She caught her breath sharply ; her eyes flooded with tears as her throat and face turned a dark and frightening red . " Oh , he was a handsome sight coming in the door , " said Vi enthusiastically . " Like to scared Ellie into fits ! All I can say is , it 's going some when a gang of hoodlums have to lay into a seventeenyear-old boy out doing a chore for his father . " Philippa looked only at Helen . " Mrs. Campion , I know how upset you are . I 'd feel the same way . But no adult in his right mind is going to be responsible for such a thing . Believe me , you 're making a great mistake in blaming Steve Bennett and me for this . " Helen opened her mouth , and Philippa hurried on . " Did Perley see any of the people who attacked him ? " Foss said implacably , " It was Young Charles spoke to him first . He started it . Must have given a signal to the others . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her room and escaped this for a night at least . She put her hands behind her back , lacing her fingers to keep them still . Viola 's smile deepened . " Do n't tell us you 're at a loss for words , Mrs. Marshall . I did n't think that could ever happen ! " Terence said suddenly , " Why do n't you tell them the truth , Philippa ? They 're asking for it . Sock it right to them . " " Terence ! " his mother cried faintly . She put her hand up and twitched at her collar . " Terence , what ails you ? Are you drunk ? " " I wish I was . Maybe you 'd all look better to me . Go on , Philippa . " She glanced around at him quickly , and he grinned at her . " Want me to ? " She shook her head and looked back at Helen . " Perhaps I am  | to blame after all , " she said gravely . " In an indirect way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't dream it would . I know for a fact that Steve Bennett is n't involved . " She paused , and the attentive silence in the room would have been flattering under different circumstances . " This morning when we discovered the ? paint work on the boat and on the schoolhouse door , Young Charles named someone I knew had n't done it . I told him I thought Perley did it . That was the extent of the conversation . I did n't ask him to avenge me , I did n't act distressed . Later Steve and I agreed to ignore the incident . If Young Charles took matters into his own hands , it was without any encouragement from me . " " You named my Perley ? " Helen 's mouth worked . She flung out her hands , desperately . " You dared to blame him ! " Asanath cleared his throat from the hall doorway , and they all looked at him . " Waal , the girl was a dite foolish to go naming names to that young devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense God gave a codfish is planning to take any chances by instigating to riot . " Helen stared at him soddenly . " If I was you , Helen , I 'd have Foss get after the Bennett boy and give the Bennett family a sharp prod where it 'll do the most good , in its importance . " He chuckled softly , " But in the meantime I 'd accept the girl 's apology and let her off , this time . " " It 's not as simple as that , Asa , " Foss said grimly . " There 's been an injustice done , and ? " " I said to tell the truth ! " Terence turned on Philippa . " Why did n't you ? " Suze 's eyes swam between him and Philippa . " Is this any particular business of yours , son ? " Asanath said . " Yes , it is , " said Terence arrogantly . " All the Campions are wading around in it clear to their gizzards , so I guess I got a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terence , " Vi invited . She laughed . " It ought to be interesting . " " Terence , " Philippa warned him , " you might as well drop a match into a bundle of oily rags . " " They need a good rousing blaze , " said Terence . He put his hands in his pockets and smiled at them , rocking a little on his toes ; he was his father to the life , suave and leisurely . " You know what drove  | the Webster kids out of the woods and to school , finally ? It was n't Philippa , here . They were scared out , just as they were scared away from school in the first place . Our Perley did it . Seems he 's a great feller for tormenting the little kids half out of their minds . " Helen made an inarticulate sound and tried to rise , but Foss put his hands on her shoulders and held her down . He watched Terence with a contemptuous smile . Vi said heartily , " What boy worth his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up . So if the Websters run every time somebody makes a loud noise , well , that 's no sign of a duck 's nest . " " What 's it a sign of , " Terence asked softly , " when Perley gets somebody to help him ambush a couple of kids no bigger than Ellie ? What makes those kids turn white as wax when he comes upon ' em sudden , and they think there 's nobody around to save ' em ? Pestering , do you call it , Vi ? " He laughed . " Why do n't you ask Ellie about some of the antics in the schoolyard before Foss took Perley out of the eighth grade , Vi ? She 'd probably tell you , if she was n't scared he 'd get even with her . He and Peg , that is . " There was a sudden harsh flush across Vi 's cheekbones . Helen burst free of Foss ' hands and rushed at Terence . " I know what you 're getting at ! " she cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her fists pounded the air in a frenzy . " They did n't want to ! I had to drag it out of them , and it just shows how decent those two young ones are compared to her . How any woman could think up such horrible things ! And how 'd she get such a bolt on you , Terence Campion , let alone the way she 's muckled onto those Ben-netts ? " " Nobody 's got a holt on me , " said Terence . " Just happens that yesterday when something came up and Foss would n't go , I went . I ) id they tell you about what happened then , Helen ? " " They told me , all right ! Told me the whole miserable story . Perley sat there with the blood running down his face , and said , Mama , I only painted that on the boat and the schoolhouse because they were saying those nasty things about me . I was driven to it . ' And I could see what he meant , and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippa with such a frantic hatred that it was like a physical blow . " Oh , yes , he told me , and Peggy said it was the truth , how you were stirring up a stink about him torturing those sneaky  | little Webster brats ! Even Sky was upset , but he could n't say why . He 's like that . Perley was driven to what he did . He was trapped into it , and then they set on him like they were all so virtuous ! " She took a long moaning breath , and Foss said sorrowfully , " You see how it is . It 's a rotten mess . The boy did wrong , painting up the boat and all , but the way I see it , he did n't know what else to do . It was self-defense . He was desperate . " " Sure he was ! " said Terence . " Desperate because somebody 's caught up with him ! " The lamplight that had always seemed so clear and bright had an oppressive glare . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would not debase herself by protesting . " Of course I did n't think Perley did the paint job , " Vi said . Of them all , she seemed to be enjoying the situation to the limit . " I thought it was Young Charles , getting even with his uncle for having the schoolma'am up in the clubhouse with no lights on . But I certainly do n't blame Perley a bit . We all know Perley does n't realize his own strength sometimes , but he 's no monster ! " She grinned at Philippa . " Seems like the pot called the kettle black just once too often . " " Waal , " Asanath began , " the boy should n't a done what he did with that paintbrush . But I can see what happened . Just natural resentment , that 's all . " He looked benignly at Philippa . " See what you 've done , my girl , all by picking up with those young ones and letting them poison your mind against Perley ? " " I see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnaturally stiff . It was not a Webster who told me , she thought , it was Sky Campion who came to warn me . . . . But she could n't implicate him . She knew beyond a doubt that Helen would always sacrifice the healthy child for the sick one , without realizing that her unreasoning , passionate defense of Perley was only setting him more deeply in his ugly ways . Her blind protection would grow more blind , more intense , as his offenses grew more dangerous , and in the end she would weep , and blame everyone else as she was blaming Philippa now . " No one poisoned my mind against Perley , " Philippa said . " I 've seen enough , and heard enough , to realize what the picture is . Every child on this island could tell you something about Perley  --  that is , if they were n't afraid of retaliation in one form or another . Mrs. Campion ? " she gazed directly into the frantic , red-rimmed eyes .  | " Believe me , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways he 's unhappy . Maybe he feels slow and inadequate compared to Peggy and Sky . Maybe people have been too impatient with him , have called him stupid too often . He senses his own limitations , and feels trapped by them . " Now her eyes took in Foss , challenging him to face the truth for this once , instead of sliding away from it with a smile and shrug . " It may be that he 's heard so much at home about Jude Webster and his wife and children being queer and slow-witted that he thinks he 's at last found somebody inferior to him  --  and that whatever he does to them is perfectly fair , the triumph of the strong over the weak . " Foss 's face was blank . She appealed to Asanath . " You must understand ! Ca n't anyone be honest here but Terence ? Do you realize that by calling me and everyone else a liar , you 're condemning that unhappy boy to Heaven knows what ? " Her voice got away from her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and bending fingers and punching children in the stomach ! It goes on and on , do n't you realize ? It could go from killing kittens to  --  to killing . " There was a short silence , and then Helen 's voice rose in a wail . " You 've just taken a dislike to my Perley , like all the other teachers ! " Philippa felt engulfed in a wave of despair , and the impulse to sickness was so strong that she turned involuntarily toward the door . Terence stopped her . He spoke to her alone , but behind them the others listened . " They 're all tarred with the same brush , " he said . " There 's only one thing I wish . I wish my mother 'd had the guts to step out on my father , so I could think I might be somebody else besides a Campion ! " He walked across the silent kitchen and went out . Philippa did not look at the other faces , but went directly to her room . She turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz , and it shut out any sounds from downstairs . She picked up her hairbrush and began to brush her hair , hard . Sound came squealing and writhing from the radio ; it seemed to bounce from wall to wall , and Philippa was caught in the center . But it was better than listening to what was said downstairs . As she brushed her hair , she looked at the room in the lamplight , at the smallflowered paper , the old-fashioned furniture , the bleak engravings and the sentimental prints , the drawn shades , the locked door . She had  | shut herself into her cave ; she would snarl if anyone threatened her privacy . When her wrist ached from the brushing , she went over to her worktable . She found that she was trembling , and thinking of Steve . Now there was no question of not telling him the things that had happened to her , only of how to tell him . What befell one of them was the concern of both ; it was the beginning of their experiences together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . He must feel that he 's taken hold of a thistle . Then the rage she had suppressed downstairs engulfed her . She held to the edge of the table , watching her fingernails go from pink to white , and let the storm sweep past . If she had allowed it to possess her in the kitchen , she could have silenced Helen 's hysteria and Vi 's malicious gaiety without raising her voice ; she would have shown them what a ruthless passion anger could be . But afterward she would have felt weak , chilled , and degraded . She had learned young the penalties of her tempers . Her opposition might be awed or even frightened by her icy intensity , but she was the one who , afterward , suffered as from any excess . She could sit still no longer . She got up and began to take her clothes out of bureau drawers , with no definite idea except perhaps to rearrange them . She wanted to be out of the house , she wanted to see Steve with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry . But there was no way to manage it , until tomorrow . If only she could have gone for a walk to tire herself , but there were Asanath and Suze to pass in the kitchen , even if the others had gone . She had laid all her clothes out on the Lone Star quilt and had begun refolding them meticulously when someone knocked at the door . The jazz program had ended and someone was playing Chopin . She snapped off the silvery flow of the nocturne and went to the door . Suze stood in the hall . Her hands , swollen-knuckled and always pale as if their continuous immersion in strong suds had soaked away their color , were folded on her stomach . She looked at Philippa with bleached eyes and said , " I want you to leave . " " Tonight ? " Philippa asked . " Tomorrow will do . You can go to your friends . I do n't want you here any longer . " She had never before spoken to Philippa with such clarity of in-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go too ? " Philippa said . " He 's gone over to Foss 's . But this time it do n't matter what Asa wants . I want you to go . " There was a faint but authentic emphasis on the I. " You 're a bad woman . " Philippa said gently , " Because of the things they said tonight ? Did you believe them all , Mrs. Campion ? " Suze shrugged . " How Foss runs his house do n't concern me . Mebbe you 're right about Perley . I should n't be surprised . I 'm positive ' t was him strangled my nice little cat I had before Tom . " She moved her head backward slightly , but she did n't look away from Philippa 's face . " No , it 's nothing to do with Perley . You 're bad because of what you 've done to Terence . He never talked in his life the way he did tonight , in front of people . I saw you talking to him in the fishhouse once . What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an answer . " And I saw you coming down the road with him and that Finnish girl yesterday , like it was all right for them to be together . " " But Mrs. Campion , " Philippa began . Suze peered up at her . " You 've changed him . He was bad enough , but since you came into this house , he 's worse . Swearing and shouting , and tonight saying he wished he was n't a Campion . " " That was a cruel thing , " Philippa said . " But he was upset . " " It 's your fault . It would be better if you got off the island altogether . " Philippa stepped back so Suze could see into the room . " Look , Mrs. Campion . I 've started to pack already . I can move out of your house , at least . " Suze nodded , and turned away . At the head of the stairs she said in her usual vague manner , " Good night . " Chapter 36 Philippa stayed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asanath insisted , and Suze accepted the terms . Terence had nothing to say , and came in only at mealtime . They lived in the strained good nature of an armed truce . The eventful night was not mentioned .  | Neither Foss nor Helen came to the house in that time , but one night Viola and Syd came to play cards . Syd gave Philippa his shy smile and duck of the head , and Viola was hearty in the overpowering way of one who savors her superiority . There was no talk of a meeting to discuss the charges against her , though she had fully expected it . By the end of the week , the two rooms on the second floor of the Binnacle were ready . She had told only Steve about the affair in the kitchen ; his face became drawn and austere as he listened , but when she said it was over and done with , he made no comment , except to say she could move into the Binnacle . For the others she had simply said that she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of the story would come out with the signs of Perley 's beating so obvious , with Vi running up to the Percy house , and the men talking as they baited up . But she planned to say nothing , no matter what hints were dropped or what questions were candidly asked . She refused also Joanna 's invitation to come and board with them , saying she wanted to keep a certain impartiality . " I suppose that 's best , " Joanna said . " But we 'd love to have you , just the same . Nils likes you . He says that you do n't talk too much . A remark like that always knocks me into an unnatural silence for at least an hour , and then he asks me if I feel sick . " They laughed , and then she added enthusiastically , " Anyway , I 've found a good stove for you ; it 's up in the home barn , and the boys will get it down for you . " There was no way , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett family , and it was Steve 's idea that the rooms could be made habitable for her . Joanna and Helmi did most of the cleaning and painting ; the children ran errands ; the men got the heavy things up the narrow stairs and set up the stove . Sooner or later the entire family was involved . One afternoon when Philippa walked around to the Binnacle after school , there was a blossoming geranium in a gaudily painted lard can . " Guess who came scooting down here like a ghost and delivered it , " Joanna said . " Lucy Webster . She looked scared to death to be caught out in broad daylight . " Philippa went to the window and touched the sturdy red blossom  | with her finger . Now that I am so nearby , she thought , I shall go to see her often . The neighborliness of the rest gave her a sense of riches , but the sight of the plant on the window , in vital up-springing silhouette against the eastward view , was like a cry in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stove newly blacked , Steve came across the harbor at high tide one morning in his boat , and loaded her luggage aboard from Asanath 's wharf . Asanath carried it down from the house ; he was as affable as if nothing had happened , and Philippa found it easy to behave in the same way . They were parting , apparently , as the best of friends . Suze stood like a shadow in the doorway ; she had stood like that on the day when Philippa arrived for the first time . The day was gray and northeasterly . It felt cold enough to spit snow , and the foarn-streaked seas rolled down between the islands with monotonous regularity . It was an ugly day , a day to remind the islanders too vividly of winter . But when Steve had kissed Philippa and gone , and she stood alone in her rooms , she experienced an exquisite lightening of spirit . This was home . She tried the word experimentally . Home . However the days went now , she would come home at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Joanna had been there already today and built a fire , leaving a saucepan of lobster chowder on the back of the stove and half a squash pie on the dresser . The red geranium blazed against the bleak prospect in the east . The pale yellow paint on the walls and cupboards gave an impression of faint sunshine . Through the open doorway into the small room tucked under the eaves , there was the mosaic of the Log Cabin quilt on her bed . When she came back after Thanksgiving , she would bring some of the small personal things that she had always kept with her as her lares and penates ; wherever she and Eric were , these things were as much their home as the shell is home to the snail . But for the first time , she felt almost as if she did n't need them . This was her home already . It lacked only Eric . Steve and Joanna had reminded her of the drawbacks to the place . She would get up in the cold mornings and build her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the well and take it upstairs . It did n't matter , she told them , when weighed against the fact that this was her own place .  | After she had eaten her dinner that first day , in a sort of solemn rejoicing , she went to the store and bought staples for her cupboards . Mark Bennett , who was usually laconic , said , " Welcome to this side of the harbor . " Kathie walked home with her and helped carry the groceries . " Boy , am I glad you 've moved over here , " she said fervently . " I 'll get out a lot more in the evenings now . I can say I 'm coming to see you . " " Then you 'd better show up , " said Philippa . " I 'm not going to uphold you in anything that 's against your people 's wishes . " Kathie laughed her great wholehearted laugh . " You think I 'm stupid enough to try to put anything over on you ? What do you think I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing bad . I just keep my eyes and ears . open and find out things like ? " she rolled her eyes around in elaborate unconcern ? " like who beat Perley up , for instance . Perley says it was a gang , and everybody believes him , but I know better . " " You 're a completely abandoned character , Kathie , " said Philippa . She could n't help laughing ; she was happy today , the raw wind whipping across the harbor and stinging her face was part and parcel of her pleasure . Kathie was another portion of it . " I suppose you think it 's immoral or something , " said Kathie . " Well , I was n't sneaking around . I just happened to be there . It was some fight . Charles kept asking Perley what he saw in the clubhouse , and Perley said finally he could n't see anything , it was dark . Now maybe he 'll think twice before tormenting kids or marking people 's boats . " Nobody else had mentioned the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm in it . Philippa said , " Maybe he will . Anyway , it 's all water under the bridge now , Kathie . It 's over and done with . " " No , " said Kathie . They had reached the Binnacle , and Gregg was coming from the well . Kathie said under her breath , " It 's not over and done with . Wait and see . " She shouted at Gregg . " Ahoy , Skipper ! How 's life on the poop deck ? " Gregg gave her a sour look . " You got an awful loud voice for a female child . Shatters a man 's eardrums . " He set his pails down on his doorstep and hitched up his pants , which as usual were sagging  | down and under the round of his belly . " Jest keep in mind what the poet says , Her voice was ever gentle , low , and sweet , an excellent thing in woman . ' " " If you do n't holler , " said Kathie , " you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sweet these days ? " " You ask your teacher about that . " Suddenly Gregg remembered his greasy and misshapen felt hat . He took it off and held it against his chest . Philippa smiled and said , " How do you do , Mr. Gregg . I hope you do n't find it too unpleasant , having someone upstairs . " " Nothing I can do about it . Place belongs to the Bennetts . They could rent it to Hottentots if they had a mind to . " " I 'll try not to make any noise , anyway . " " You 'll try ! " said Kathie with relish , as they went up the stairs . " Wait till he gets his next bottle , and he starts that clarinet a-going ! " Philippa hushed her . Kathie stayed long enough to look at everything , and then , while she was standing by the window , she saw Terence on his way to pick up the mail , and went downstairs with a coltish clatter . Philippa shuddered for Gregg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The afternoon settled into a solitude that was rich and soul-satisfying . Rain began in hard showers against the window , but the fire threw out a live and crackling warmth . She lit her lamp early for the pleasure of its soft yellow light . She wrote to Eric and told him she had moved in . She prepared schoolwork for the next week . She read a book with her supper , and while she was washing her few dishes , someone came up the stairs ; she knew it was Steve and stood there listening , thinking that she had never heard him come up over stairs before . Suddenly the rightness of the scene possessed her , as if all that had gone before were unreality  --  the meetings in the Campions ' kitchen , the escaping into nights that had become so cold . But this seemed as it should be ; herself moving in the lamplight , putting dishes away in the cupboard ; the sheen of the teakettle on the stove and its singing above the sounds of the fire ; the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black pane where the red geranium stood doubled by its reflection . She went over and pulled down the shade just as Steve knocked softly at the door .  | Chapter 37 Sunday Philippa awoke with the first of the engines in the harbor , but she did not resent the earliness . She built her fire and got back into bed , and lay listening to the engines , the gulls , the crows . She had no view directly on the harbor , but she did n't care ; she could sec if Steve went by , she could look eastward , and the sun poured in on her as she ate her breakfast . When she had finished her breakfast , she took one of her pails and went to the well . From up behind Nils Sorensen 's house came the sound of children 's voices . Philippa hooked her pail on the pole and lowered it into the well . She had a great sense of leisure and lifted the pail up slowly , leaning over the edge and looking down into the wet darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked around to see Terence . " Let go , " he said . " I 'll draw it up . " " Look here , I 've got to get used to this , " she protested , but she le go , and he brought the pail up and set it dripping on the well curb " Thank you very much . I did n't know there was a man on the island this morning . " " My boat sprung a leak yesterday . I 've got to ground her out and go all over her . " He picked up the pail and started toward the Binnacle . " I 'd like to see how you 're fixed up , if it 's all right with you . " His tone was brusque and cool , as if he had just become aware of his voice as a means of expression . " Of course it 's all right with me . I can even give you a cup of coffee . " " Thanks . " He gave her a slight sideways smile . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incongruity of it . At first Terence had been as insubstantial as a spirit , then she had actively disliked him , and now he sat at her table and she was pouring coffee for him . She poured a cup for herself and sat down opposite him .  | " I have n't had a chance to tell you , " she said , " but I appreciated your coming in on my side that night . It meant a great deal to me . The only thing is , I 've regretted getting you in trouble with your parents . " " I 've always been in trouble with them , " he said indifferently . The morning sun cast a harsh illumination on his lean features . " Ever since I was born , I guess . " " Were you in the service , Terence ? " " I tried to be . I started when I was seventeen , kept going the rounds , Navy , Army , Marines , Coast Guard . They would n't have me . " He took out his cigarettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , showing a ghost of defiance . Philippa waited , hiding her sympathy . He would n't want it . " One lousy kidney . " He scratched a kitchen match with his thumbnail and lit a cigarette . " I suppose Elmo was a perfect physical specimen . " The lighted match flamed in mid-air ; his stare was cold and angry . " What do you know about Elmo ? " " Only that you had a brother , and he died a hero . " She wondered if she had gone too far , but she hid her uncertainty . " No one 's been gossiping , if that 's what you think . Steve mentioned your brother when we were talking about the war . My husband was killed , you knew that . " He nodded , still staring at her defensively . " But why did you say that about Elmo  --  just then ? " " I was guessing . " She drank some coffee . " I have an older sister who was very pretty and was always perfectly charming to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something down , and I used to blurt out everything I thought , no matter what . I hated Jenny for years . " " I do n't know if I hated Elmo . " He looked out of the window again . " He was a pretty nice guy . But I guess I hated them for being so foolish about him . He did n't ask for it . He did n't eat it up . Everybody liked Elmo . I would have , if he had n't been my brother . He tried to  --  well , I guess you 'd call it take me under his wing , but I would n't have anything to do with him . Hurt his feelings . " " I was the same way , " said Philippa . " I 'd lurk around the outside , scowling , and whenever Jenny tried to drag me in , I 'd snarl . "  | " It was something like that with us . After he was killed , I used to think a lot of things . Sometimes I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he 'd gone out and got killed on purpose to make my father call him a hero . He should 've come back and sooner or later got married , or done something else they would n't like , and then maybe I 'd have a chance . " " I was lucky , " Philippa said . " Nothing happened to Jenny . " He prodded the soil around the geranium with the match . " When I was n't mad with Elmo , I 'd get to remembering the way he looked at me sometimes when I 'd tell him to go chase himself . Then I 'd think what a crime it was , for him , to go off thinking I hated him . I ca n't remember acting as if I liked him even halfway . " Philippa put fresh coffee in his cup . " I 'll have to bake some coffee cake , " she said . " I 'm quite a cook . " She wished she could think of something to say to Terence , but nothing came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and his sawdust spilled out . He was watching her warily , and she said , " Regret is the worst thing of all to live with . Rage and grief you can stand , you can get over them , but you ca n't ever get away from regret . " " I do n't know why they did n't have another one , after me . Maybe they decided it was n't safe to try again . " He grinned derisively . " Anyway , I wished for a long time back there , when Elmo was dead and I could n't get into the service , that there was a kid brother . I had all kinds of queer ideas . I thought I could be as decent to him as Elmo tried to be to me , and of course he 'd be different from me , he 'd be decent too , and in some crazy way we 'd make up for the way it was between me and Elmo . See what I mean ? " " I see . " She drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond Long Cove , the long wavering ruffles of surf . " Kathie 's like a kid brother , is n't she ? " she said finally . " I guess you 'd call it that . " He flushed slightly . " You heard things about us around the house . Heard ' em elsewhere too , most likely . Some people have their minds in the gutter . " " I 've heard both sides , " she said . " There are some who do n't believe any harm of you and Kathie , Terence . " " Good Lord , " he burst out , " I 'm twenty-seven and the kid 's fourteen . What the devil do they take me for ? Sure , I 'm a half-wit , but Perley 's all right , he 's just a boy . Any boy worth his salt ? " He  | mimicked his aunt , and for an instant he looked so comically like her that Philippa laughed aloud . " I 'm sorry , Terence , " she said quickly . " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his chair . " Thanks for the coffee . I guess I 've been doing a lot of gassing around here this morning . Thanks for putting up with it . " " It was good for me . " She was lying again , looking at him with the eyes of innocence . " It 's the first time in my life I 've admitted to anyone how I felt about Jenny . " He leaned down and carefully dropped his dead cigarette butt in the cuff of his rubber boot . " I 've never talked about Elmo either . " " Then it 's been good for both of us . " She walked to the door with him and stood at the head of the stairs while he went down . " Come in again , Terence , " she called after him . " Thank you for carrying my water pail . " As he went out , she heard Kathie 's surprised shout of greeting , ringing from a distant point like the call of the Valkyries . In a little while she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered why the innocent must be forever damned by their sense of guilt , while the truly guilty were always so vain about their virtues . Terence walked lazily , his hands in his pockets , and Kathie strode beside him like the young boy she was meant to be . Joanna had invited her to Sunday dinner , and afterward she and Steve were going to walk around the Eastern End , where she had never been . She was putting her topcoat on when , inexplicably , she remembered Vinnie . She had thought of the girl often since Steve had told her the story , but never with such a cruel brilliance as now . If whatever had happened to Vinnie had n't happened , she , Philippa , would not be standing here now with Steve 's image as tangible a part of her as her own hands and feet . If Justin had not died at Iwo Jima , Steve would not now be waiting with a strong intimate consciousness of her . Each of them had lived through the long agony of disbelief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them loved the lost one still , with a particular tenderness burnished by the years . The first love , the lost love , and yet not lost , she thought ; for from the first there remained a portion for this slow sweet second flowering .  | Chapter 38 Young Charles had not been near since she had moved in , though he had been busy enough helping to collect her heavier furnishings . She had met him several times then and wondered if his curtness was due to the fact that other people were in the rooms at the time . After she moved in , she saw him sometimes from her window , and whether he was alone or with Fort , he seemed morose , walking with his head down and his hands in his pockets . She hoped it was not because of her ; by all the laws of high-spirited male youth , he should have come to her in the full panoply of his manhood to claim credit for punishing Perley . He was not one of the silent Bennetts , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , made him crow . She met Charles and Fort by the beach one day when she was going home from school . Charles became busy rolling a cigarette , but Fort 's broad merry face broke into a grin . " Well , how is it , perched up there ? Gregg been up yet ? " " No , and neither have you . " She looked from one to the other . " You 'll have to see how it looks . It 's a real home now . Everybody 's been dropping in . " " Well , sure , " Fort began , his light brown eyes crinkling happily . Charles looked up from his cigarette . " I see you 've been entertaining Terence , " he said in mock elegance . " Among others . " She lifted her eyebrows , and Fort laughed . " Do n't mind him . He 's melancholic . You ought to hear the way they cart it to him down at the shore . " " Cart what to him ? " Fort shrugged his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , you know the way they do when they find a new way to twit a feller . Talk about that fancy reparty ! They got some real flashing wit going around . Sparkles to beat all get-out . " Charles swung his head around and said viciously , " Oh , go fry ? " '  | He threw down his cigarette and went down the beach . Philippa looked after him regretfully . " I 'll fetch him up some night , " Fort said . " Mebbe you can cheer him up . " His voice grew sober . " He 'll get over it sometime , but I know why the girls over at Brigport do n't look like anything to him any more . They 're kind of raw , kind of like green apples , if you know what I mean . Well , so is he , but he ca n't see it . " " What makes you so wise , Fort ? " she asked . His grin seemed to shatter his face into twinkling fragments . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at me , so I better not waste my heart looking at them . " " Waste my heart , ' " Philippa laughed . " Fort , you 're a philosopher and a poet . " " You say that real pretty , ma'am , " said Fort . " Thank you kindly . " They both looked down at Charles , a solitary dark figure at the edge of the water , kicking beach rocks overboard . " I 'll bring Gloomy Gus up real soon . " " Do that , " said Philippa . " We 'll make a party out of it . " She called good-by to Charles , but he did n't look around . But Charles came alone , and earlier than she had expected , just as she got home from school one blustery afternoon . He walked into the kitchen and stood against the door . " Sit down , Charles , " she said . " It 's nice to see you . " " Have n't got time . " He stared at her broodingly , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to stop off in the clubhouse for , that night ? " She was measuring coffee , and she put the spoon down and looked at him . " What business is it of yours , Charles ? " she asked quietly . " It was nothing in the first place , and it 's gone by long since . " " You think so ? " His laugh was exaggeratedly sinister . It would have been funny if she had n't been so angry with him . She went hack to measuring coffee . Suddenly Charles came forward and knocked the spoon out of her hand . He shouted at her , " Do n't you care what they 're saying ? And now you 're living up here alone , that just makes it worse ! How can you stand there and not turn a hair ? Vi and Helen are out for your  | scalp , and they 're dirty . They wo n't stop at anything till they get everybody wondering if there is n't some fire under all that smoke . And Asa wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't till he gets tired of listening to ' em . " " I know all that , Charles , " she said . " And it 's not a pleasant prospect , but I do n't think they can hurt me very much . I 'm thinking about you at the moment . " " Me ? " He flushed . " I 'm not in the habit of discussing my conduct with anyone . But because you were one of my first friends here , I 'll make an exception and ask you a question : Do you believe Perley had any good reason to paint what he did on the boat and the door ? " He stared at her almost in horror , and then his blush deepened . He opened his hand and studied his palm . When he looked up again , his eyes were shiny , as if they were wet . " I was mad , " he said harshly . " You giving that moron a chance to get something on you . " " But he did n't get something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done me an injustice , Charles . You could at least have given me the benefit of the doubt . " " I never really thought anything ! I just ? " " You just thought maybe . And the maybe was enough . I think Perley got a little extra on the beating because you were so mad at me . " " I 'm not sorry I mohaggled him , " he said defiantly . " He had it coming to him . " Then he smiled at her , tentative and appealing . " ' Course it made you a lot of trouble . I guess I 've been a fool . Think there 's any hope for me ? " " Well , you 're still a growing boy . I 'd say you had quite a future ahead of you . " " Go ahead , cart it to me . " But his smile became a grin , charmingly vain once more . Charles and Fort came up the next evening , just after Steve had arrived . Fort had his fiddle case under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're agreeable , " he said . Charles was aloof again , as if he had n't forgiven her and Steve . He sat forward , his elbows on his knees , and stared at the floor as Fort tuned his fiddle . Philippa watched him covertly while she knitted on Eric 's sweater .  | Fort began to play , and " The White Cockade " was brave in the room . If Gregg had his fifth , the time-keeping foot could n't bother him . Steve was trotting his foot too , lightly , and one of Charles 's began to move , jerkily , as if it were entirely separate from his mood . Fort went from " The White Cockade " to " My Love Is But a Lassie Yet . " He loved to play ; it was in his face and the way he pressed his cheek to the smooth tawny wood and curved his hand about the neck . The fiddle was cheap and old , but the tones were true . Fort clowning on the beach as he scrubbed out hogsheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his cheek to the fiddle and the scroll turning back from his big hand , the bow dancing staccato in the other , was someone else . There were tunes that Philippa did n't know , and still he went on , as if he were caught in a mesh of his own weaving . Sometimes Phi-lippa and Steve smiled at each other faintly across the room . Then she caught herself glancing quickly at Charles to see if he had noticed , but she could n't tell . Fort stopped at the end of a reel to adjust a string . Steve held out his cigarettes to him , but Fort shook his head and went on playing . Now it was something quiet , as simple as Brahms ' " Lullaby " and with much the same quality . His eyes were half shut , and his freckled face took on a peaceful maturity . By middle age , Philippa thought , Fort would be a rare person . Now he veiled his sensitivity with unsubtle humor , but it showed in spite of himself when he played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blinked around at the others like someone waking good-humoredly from sleep . " I 'll have that cigarette now , " he said . Steve handed it to him silently . Charles sat back in his chair , sprawling his legs before him ; somewhere during the playing he had relinquished his antagonism for the time being . " You and Cynthy make a real purty pair , Fort , " he said . " Of course , if you were a singer , you 'd be drier than a cork leg by now . " " I am , bub , " Fort wheezed in suitably parched tones . " Oh , I can take a hint , " said Philippa . " He deserves champagne , hut coffee will have to do . " She pushed the teakettle forward on the stove . At the same time there was a clatter in the entry downstairs , thumpings and incoherent mutterings . " Sounds like somebody was trying to herd an elephant upstairs , "  | said Fort . " Where would anybody get an elephant , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregg 's , " said Steve . He went across to the door and put his ear to the crack . " Or one of Syd 's , gone astray , " suggested Charles . Gregg 's voice came in squealing outrage through the door . " I 'm a-comin ' up there ! Anybody makes music in this house , a-poundin ' them big hummels of feet right over my bed so the plaster 's comin ' down like snow , I got a right to make music too ! " " Open the door , Steve , " Philippa said . " Tell him to come up . " " He is n't waiting , he 's on his way , " said Steve wryly . He opened the door and shone his flashlight down the stairs . " Come on up , Gregg . " There were frantic scrambling sounds , and Gregg 's panting . The boys leaned past Steve and urged Gregg on . " I bet you can hear this all over the island , " Fort said enthusiastically . " They 'll think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beam of the flashlight , Philippa saw Gregg 's red , sweatshining face and the whites of his eyes rolled wildly toward her . He had his clarinet in his hand . Finally he reached the top step . " Now do n't tell me I 'm drunk ! " he commanded . " I got no more rum in me than  --  than  --   --  " " Than an old sponge dropped in a barrel of rum , " said Charles . " Hurray for Gregg ! " Gregg , wiping his wet face on his arm , grinned . He staggered only slightly before he reached a chair . He lifted the clarinet to his mouth at once , and his blue eyes turned toward Fort . Fort nodded . Gregg began to play something that sounded like Mozart to Philippa , and Fort joined in . She could hardly believe it was Mozart , played in this island kitchen by a quarrelsome little man in clothes that smelled of liquor and bait , and followed with such fidelity by a boy with no education , who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nagging familiarity , and if she shut her eyes , she could almost catch it . . . . Should n't the violin have been a flute . . . ? Gregg had taught Fort this part , obviously . It was exciting and incredible . It ended too soon ; Gregg put down his clarinet in a gust of foolish laughter , and said , " Where 's ' at coffee ? " " I 'll have it ready in just a moment , " she said quickly . " Keep on  | playing . " She thought suddenly , If only Justin were here ! She looked around quickly , as if she had said it aloud . Charles was fascinated , as lost in the moment as a child . Steve 's face was calm and distant . She wondered if he had listened to such music with Vinnie . They had no more music after the coffee . As Gregg sobered slightly , he lost his good nature and became sad . The others had been talking around the table , but Gregg 's depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept looking nervously at Gregg . Charles stared into his coffee cup . Gregg muttered to himself at intervals ; all at once he reared back in his chair and stared across the kitchen into the shadows of Philippa 's room . " Is my boy in there ? " he asked loudly . " You got no boy , Gregg , " Charles said uneasily . Gregg ignored I , him . " Tell him to come out , " he said , lurching to his feet and still staring at the door . " There 's no one in there , " Philippa told him kindly . " Really there is n't . Show him , Steve . " Steve helped him to the door of the little room and flashed the light around . Gregg grabbed it from him and flashed it around again . Turning back to the others , he looked incredulous and sad . " Where is he ? " he asked faintly . " I just saw him . Standing there in the doorway , all a-grin . " He wiped his hand across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " I better git down below , " he muttered . " No place for me here . " " Wait up , man , " Steve said . " I 'll help you . If you fetch up with a bang at the foot of the stairs , how 's the schoolma'am going to lug her wood and water over you ? " He put his long arm firmly around Gregg 's pudgy middle , and started down the stairs with him . Philippa held the light and watched their descent . She felt chilled and tired ; Gregg 's change had shattered their happy mood . She rested her head against the door frame , and stood there even after Gregg and Steve had gone out . The cold night air scented with rockweed blew up the stairs toward her . " I thought Gregg always saw cats when he was polluted , " Fort paid in a subdued tone . " I never knew he had a boy , " Charles answered . When Steve came upstairs , she thought he seemed tired too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoking . He too had no answer for Gregg 's strange behavior except , " He 's an old man , a drunk . Maybe he had a boy once , I do n't know . " Philippa wished urgently that the boys would go . As if he sensed it , Fort put his fiddle away , but Charles got up and went over to the stove . He propped one foot on the stove hearth and rested his folded arms across his knee . " I guess this is kind of an anticlimax , after Gregg , " he began rather diffidently . " But somebody 's fooling around my traps who has no business to . Some have been hauled and dumped with the doors left open ; some are gone clip and clean , I ca n't find them at all . " " Well . " Steve watched him through smoke . " That looks like a fine way to spend a Saturday , messing up another man 's gear . Why did n't you say something before ? You mean you and Nils kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to think about it awhile . Try to figure out what to do . But I ca n't figure anything . " Charles scowled . " Must be why Foss and his ocean pearl went out at the crack of dawn today . We met ' em coming home when we were on the way out . " Philippa poured fresh coffee for herself and held the cup in both cold hands . " I had a hundred traps set out , " Charles went on . " Half of ' em are gone . That 's three hundred and fifty dollars just disappeared , and nothing but crabs and sea urchins in the rest . And Foss waved at us real cordial when he went past . " " What does Nils say ? " Steve asked . " We were hauling together so he could n't tell me it was all in my head . I 've had him tell me my traps got drowned in deep water because I had short warps on ' em . Well , he did n't tell me anything like that today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perley , because Foss cornered him at the shore the other day and claimed I had roughed up Perley . He also had to admit Foss knew what Perky was doing , because Perley goes with him this time of year , same as I do with you or Nils , and Fort with his old man . After he admitted all that , he chewed his lip and did some plain and fancy thinking . " " Then I suppose he said , Let 's go and cut off every last trap of theirs , ' " said Steve . Charles grinned . " Yeah . I had my sheath knife all ready and he  | said , Put that away , boy . The family will set you up with some new gear if you 've got nothing saved . We 're not starting any lobster war : " Charles shrugged . " I told him it was already started , but you know how he is . I suppose you think he 's right . " He pulled his brows together aggressively . " I know he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember when your father had his knife ready , and called your grandfather soft as warm wax for not wanting a lobster war . Now we 've got some sense on us along with our gray hairs . A lobster war could clean out every-111 body on this place as fast as a shooting war could do . No man in his right mind wants trouble in these waters . " " Foss must be out of his , then , " said Charles . l , l " I admit I never thought Foss would get mixed up in anything like this . I thought he was too cautious . Well , he 's safe enough . You and Nils did n't see anything . " Steve glanced over at Philippa . " Got some more coffee there ? " As she refilled his cup , he went on talking to Charles . Fort sat by the table , his red hair coppery bright in the lamplight , staring down seriously at the pattern of the tablecloth . " Maybe he figured it would be a good lesson for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows your family wo n't let you get back at him , so he feels safe with his revenge . I doubt if your lose any more traps . So just figure you had your whack at Perley and he had his whack at you and forget it . " " Fine speech . " Charles was sarcastic . " You ought to run for Congress . Look , if I ever get out to haul without you or Nils , I 'm going to get even with those two . " " Nobody ever gets even in a lobster war , " Steve said somberly . " It might turn out that a warden will close the grounds and then none of us will tend any pots . The Campions do n't want that any more than we do ; they 've made money since they came here , and they want to make some more . So if you just stop breathing so hard and calm down , this will fade out and be forgotten and no real harm clone . " Charles slapped his own chest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trap stuff and all the lobsters I lost besides ! I 've got something coming to me ! " " Sure . " Steve nodded imperturbably . " A job on the mainland . Or you can go into the Navy . You go out and touch their traps and  | you 'll wind up pushed right out of lobstering and off the islan . Your father wo n't fit you out with new traps forever . " He carried his cup to the table and put cream and sugar into it . Charles said angrily , " No use talking to these Bennetts , they think they know so much . They 're so scared of something happening to their island paradise anybody could spit in their faces and they would n't fight back ! It might cost money , it might bring the warde down ! " " Charles , have some fresh coffee , " Philippa said . Her wor ? sounded inane to her . She did n't blame him for the curt sidewa look . " No , thanks . I guess I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . his cap and jacket from the hook by the door . Fort got up . " Thanks for the coffee and cake , Mis ' Marshall . I hope you didn mind Cynthy 's squawks and squeaks too much . " " Cynthy sang like a bird . I 've never had a private concert in life . I 'm greatly honored . " " By gorry , you say that nice , now . " Charles was going down t stairs and Fort called , " Hey , wait up ! " Chapter 39 After the sound of them had died away , Steve still stood by the table , stirring his coffee . He looked meditative and aloof . Philippa felt loneliness like a physical chill . Now she was out of his sphere= certainly in this affair she was an outsider , yet an outsider who h.ui become irretrievably enmeshed in their troubles . She took a step toward him and said sharply , " Do n't tell me I 'm not responsible for all this . " He gave her a severe , incisive glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as important as you think you are . " " Oh , I see , " she said distantly . She turned back to the stove a. put an unnecessary piece of wood on the fire . " I wondered when you were going to start acting like a worn in love , " Steve said . 220  | " How is a woman in love supposed to act ? " she asked without expression , gazing at the stove lifter in her hand . " Touchy , " said Steve . He came up behind her and put his arms around her . She stood there stiffly . She thought almost with longing of the sheltered uneventful life she had led with Eric before they came to Maine . There might have been no moments of sweet and unexpected passion , but neither had there been anything like this ; she felt angry , confused , and tired all at once . I should never have come here , she thought . " I 'm sorry I bit you , " Steve murmured . " But you deserved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll have to stop thinking everything that happens is personal . " " I do n't know if I want to be an island woman . " Steve said evenly , " That 's right . You 've never told me you 'd marry me . " He did n't take his arms away , his breath was warm against her ear . " Tell me now , " he said . " Let 's be engaged . " His arms tightened around her waist , and gently he touched the side of her ear with his teeth . Why ca n't he be bad-tempered this once ? she asked herself helplessly . She knew she was going to be petty and waspish . She was dismayed , but not enough to put a stop on her tongue . The mood had been common enough with her when she was young , and she had taken a perverse satisfaction in it . She knew now it was a hunger to provoke violence , as a sort of catharsis for the stress of the moment . If Steve refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tonight , he deserved to see the worst of her . " What about the island ? " she asked in a constricted voice . " What about all these troublesome things ? " " The island will take care of itself , " Steve answered . " It always has . Never mind that , now . Think of us . Look , we could have one of the Eastern End houses for the best seasons and move back to the harbor in the winters . " " What about Vinnie ? " The name crackled in the room like the sudden blaze of a match . She turned in his arms to look squarely at him . " You told me once you did n't know if she was alive or dead . How can you talk about marriage when you 're not sure about her ? " He le said equably , " I do n't know in black and white whether she 's dead or alive . But I 've had a feeling for a long time that she 's  | well ? " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pockets . " She 's been blown out like a lamp or like one of tho candles she was so crazy about . She just is n't . " " But suppose you 're wrong  --  suppose that occurred to you jus because I came along . It 's always easier to focus on something tangible . Even I know that dreams can die for lack of nourishment . Then suppose that after we 're married a letter comes one day . Or Vinnie herself steps off the mail boat . It 's happened to other people . Why not to you ? " She was rewarded by the almost inimical contraction of his pupils . " What 's possessed you , Philippa ? You 've never trotted Vinnie out before . Leave the poor kid in peace , and tell me what 's really on your mind . " " I 've just told you , " she said airily . She moved away from him , loathing herself and wishing he would go . " Is that all you intend to say ? " he asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp and adjusted the wick . She felt the force of his bewilderment and his losing struggle against anger filling the room . " I guess you 're right . There is n't anything more . " He reached for his windbreaker and put it on , and picked up his cap . He came toward her and stood waiting . She did n't look at him . There was a peculiar sensation in her lips . They wanted to tremble . " If you do n't want to marry me , " he said , " why ca n't you say so ? You do n't have to tell me the reasons for it . You do n't have to make up a story for yourself around Vinnie . " " It 's not a story . I have n't made it up . " Her voice rose a little . Suddenly she thought in the wild relief of self-pity , It 's the truth ; I 've never really been sure that it 's over between him and Vinnie , whether she 's dead or alive . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to get a divorce , Phil , just in case , " he said patiently . She shrugged . " What 's a divorce ? Would it end what you feel in your heart for her ? No , if she should come and we were married , everything you felt for her back there in San Francisco would come alive again  --  because it 's never really been dead . I ca n't take a chance on that , Steve . " His skin had an odd pallor in the lamplight . " What about Justin ? " he asked in a low voice . " I 'm taking a chance on him . "  | " We know Justin wo n't be back , " she said , looking at him steadily . It was like a nightmare , but there was no awakening from it . She had to go on talking . " I fought this at the first , Steve , and then I gave in because I thought it might be something real and wonderful . But I 'm seeing the facts now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this island , and tonight I know that I ca n't compete with Vinnie , whether she 's alive or a memory . " She thought in surprise , He looks actually ill . There was a fine film of sweat on his forehead . He was staring at her as if he , too , realized the nightmare and their helpless participation in it . " Philippa ? " He half whispered it . She wanted to say to him , Steve , please go . I have to be alone to see things clear and rest my bruises . She knew that if she did say it , it would be all he needed ; but this was part of the familiar mood , that she could be weeping and desolate inside and still show an arrogant indifference . " Good night , " he said finally . The words dropped into the quiet with a cold separateness . He waited for a moment more and then went to the door . A passionate wish to stop him sprang up wildly in her ; when he paused at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her toward him . She stared past the lamp at the window and waited in a lightheaded expectancy to be overpowered . He did n't pause at the door . It closed gently behind him and he went down the stairs . She turned and gazed at the door with a burning sensation in her face and eyes ; she could hardly believe he had gone . She lay awake for hours , dry-eyed and feverish ; she tried to cry , but she could not . She heard the wash of water on the harbor shore , and the far-off rote , and saw the first gray light come around the edges of the shade . There was no quick , slick solution for the consequences of her behavior . A mature woman has no excuses . She could hear Justin saying it , in a level , impersonal voice . Human weakness he could condone , but not human pettiness . Even Justin had never understood what caused these moods in her . It was not the sort of thing one explains easily . She knew there had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events like the meeting of tide and wind that made the violent rip tide outside the harbor mouth .  | She slept finally , all through the early morning departure of the boats , and awoke just in time to get ready for school . As she walked through the village , for the first time she saw the winter look of t he island ; the houses seemed to huddle in dun-colored loneliness at the edge of the harbor , and the wind sliced through her clothing and into her flesh . She thought with longing of the snug shell of her rooms ; she would have liked to remain there immobile all day , neither stirring nor thinking . Everything was finished between her and Steve , she was sure of it . It was her doing . The thing was preposterous , but it had happened . In time the ache would fade to dullness and perhaps disappear altogether , unless , she thought wryly , she felt it in certain weather , like an old scar : whenever she saw a sparkle like diamonds overlaying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night wind blowing around her , or whenever she smelled a freshly ironed shirt . The next few days went by as if nothing had happened , except that she saw Steve only at distances . From her kitchen window she might see him in the road ; as she walked from school , she might see him at his mooring . Once when she went out to the well , she saw him going home with two pails of water . Linnea bobbed behind him like a puppy . She saw Philippa and called " Hi ! " in her clear round voice , and Philippa answered , but Steve did n't turn . In school there was peace . Sky was absorbed with his work , as if Philippa had never seen him sick and weeping behind a pile of traps , and Peggy went through her classes with a haughty indifference . Outside , everything looked the same . But it seemed to Philippa that there was a queer , invisible distortion , as if under their surface all things had changed their shapes . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Justin died . She made some calls on parents , first Mrs. Percy and then Helmi Bennett . She tried the Webster door , but no one answered . People called on her ; Joanna came upstairs for coffee and a chat . Ralph and Rob visited her early one evening . The young Percys and Ellie Goward came up and looked at everything with the frank , scientific interest of clerks making inventories . Helmi Bennett sent her a loaf of Finnish coffee bread . Philippa wondered when they would all realize that Steve was no longer coming to see her ; perhaps they knew already , but they would n't mention it to her , of course . No  | doubt it had taken precedence over the Websters and Young Charles 's traps and Perley 's beating . One afternoon as she came home from school , she saw Foss Campion 's boat tied up at the head of the long wharf . It had been only a few weeks since he 'd overhauled and repainted her . Now he stood on the wharf with Asanath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little distance from them , his back against a pile of traps . He smiled vacantly into the pale warmth of the sun . There was no one else on the beach except Jude Webster , who was piling the last of his new traps onto his dory to take out and load on his boat . There had been no really bad weather since he 'd started fishing his new string , and the children were coming to school with new shoes and more substantial clothing . At least she could feel a twinge of satisfaction about that , she thought , but felt nothing . As she passed the men on the wharf , she said pleasantly , " Good afternoon . " Asanath nodded . " Afternoon , Philippa . " Randall 's round face , lacking the comic ease of his sons ' , puckered in his habitual grin . Foss looked down at the ground . After she had gone by , Foss spoke up distinctly . " I lay it all to her . Neither father nor mother can hold a hand over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood . " The words stopped her as effectively as a hand pulling her around . For a second she considered going on ; here was something surely on which she could close a door . But for the first time in three days , she felt a violent response . She walked back to the men . Randall Percy was blushing and kicking at the stones , and Asanath watched her speculatively , but she kept her eyes on Foss . " Was that remark intended for me , by any chance ? " she asked pleasantly . " If the shoe fits , wear it . " Foss spat on the stones . " Hey , listen , Foss , " Randall said urgently . He pulled out a bandanna and mopped his freckled forehead . " What is it that you lay to me ? " Philippa asked . Foss nodded his head toward his boat . " You know as well as I do . War n't it planned up in your place to begin with ? " His light eyes glinted in the shade of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please explain , Mr. Campion ? "
