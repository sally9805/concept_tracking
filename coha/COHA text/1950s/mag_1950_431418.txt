DOES your motoring day start like this ? Open the garage doors . Get in the car and back it out . Climb out , make a detour around the front fender , and close and latch the doors . Dodge the fender again and get in . On returning , reverse the whole routine . That 's how I used to do it . Today I walk into my attached garage from the house and touch a button . While the doors open , I get in the car . After backing it out , I pause long enough to touch a second button , under the dash . A spotlight on the car winks ? and the doors close . They lock , too . You ca n't get in from outside unless you have a key or drive up in my car . Headlights or an ordinary spotlight wo n't work . The rig takes no juice when it 's standing by , because there are no vacuum tubes to be kept hot . But when I get back from a trip , whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of the button . The dash button sends juice to the light and to a magnet that pulls a thin spring or reed on which a contact is mounted . This  | breaks the circuit until the reed , released , closes it again , just as in a doorbell . Thus the light blinks at the reed 's frequency . As the beam hits a photo cell on the garage , this generates a pulsating current that is fed into a coil of fine wire fixed on another , similarly tuned reed and poised over a permanent magnet . The current vibrates the reed at the same frequency , until it swings far enough to touch a contact that closes a 115-volt relay and starts the door mechanism . A steady light , or one of the wrong frequency , will agitate the resonant reed but wo n't swing it far enough to make contact . Power unit . A 1/8-hp. motor is the muscle that moves the doors . It 's belted through a jackshaft to run an output shaft at about 175 r.p.m . Plain pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings shown . The rope that pulls the doors is simply looped four times around the windlass shaft and tied to a weight that hangs close to the wall . This gives plenty of traction but will slip if something jams . Door linkage . A piece of pipe set in  | the center of the door lintel is fastened by an elbow and a short length of pipe to the garage ceiling . On this slide two large , loosely fitting washers bent to an angle along one side and bolted to wooden thrust arms . One washer necessarily slides behind the other . The rope from the power unit is fastened to the rear washer . As this is pulled forward , it pushes the other before it . The wooden arms are pivoted on the doors by small hinges . A long spring holds the forward thrust arm back against the other thrust arm , so that the two move back together as the doors close . This spring is not powerful enough to drag the rope around the windlass and lift the weight . Thus the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the doors open must be removed . The center latch that secures one door shut is wired to a pivoted pulley over which the windlass rope runs . Being attached forward of the pivot point , the latch wire is tripped as soon as the rope pulls . A lock on the latched door enters a strike on the other , locking both . Reversing switch . This is a doublepole , double-throw toggle switch of a rating high enough to handle the motor current . It 's mounted on the door jamb atop a box that also houses the photo cell .  | A hole is drilled through the toggle arm parallel to its throw . A stiff wire through this is fitted with two stop collars and a spring , goes through a guide . eye in the jamb , and is fastened to a small chain attached to the door . Proportion the wire and chain so that they snap the switch forward just before the door is wide open . This will stop the motor by opening the circuit for an instant , thus opening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next half of the cycle . Set it so the door hits the end of the wire and flips the switch back just before it 's fully closed . Photo cell . This is an inexpensive selenium barrier-layer type , which generates a minute current when light strikes it . Bore a hole in the door for the light beam . Spotlight blinker . This unit , which goes in the car , has a reed ? a thin metal strip ? that is vibrated by an electromagnet . Contacts on the reed open and close both spotlight and magnet circuits . The reed and its upper contact strip are sandwiched between plastic ' or fiber strips bridging two bolts . Contact points from an old relay or vibrator are soldered on . Adjust the reed , by turning the nut at its outer end , to vibrate six to eight times per second . Since the spotlight current is intermittent , around 12 volts must be supplied to the 6-volt bulb to bring it up to full brilliance for exciting the photo cell . The easiest way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four large dry cells in series with the car battery . The light is on only a second or two at a time , so they should have long life . Resonant Relay . Triggered by photocell current , this is the control center in the garage . The permanent magnet of a junked 4 " radio speaker was pried out of its bracket so that the bracket hole could be filed to a free fit for the voice coil . Then the magnet was cemented in place again . The reed itself forms one voice-coil connection ; use fine wire for the other . Adjust the reed to the same frequency as the blinker on the car by observing the reed in the spotlight beam , preferably at night , while tapping the reed with a finger . When in tune , the vibrating reed should appear still or nearly so because of the stroboscopic effect of the blinking light . Tune it by adding solder , or adjust the blinker reed .  |                 @ @ @ @
