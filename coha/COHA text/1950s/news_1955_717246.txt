txt Secretary of State Dulles suggested today that if Communist China would renounce the use of military force the path toward broad negotiations would be opened . Mr. Dulles told his news conference that signs had appeared that might mark the beginning of a new phase in Communist China 's relations with the rest of the world . But he was quick to warn that " one swallow does not make a summer . ' ' The Secretary was in a mood of optimism and confidence regarding the state of the world at his weekly news conference . He had a good word for Chou En-lai , Premier and Foreign Minister of Communist China . He said he thought Mr. Chou 's latest speech was moving in the right direction . Addressing the National People 's Congress in Peiping Saturday , Mr. Chou called for a collective peace treaty among the countries of the Asian-Pacific region , including the United States . He said his Government was wilI'ng to negotiate with " the rest onsible local authorities " of Formosa for the ' " peaceful liberation " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the Soviet Union might have decided to lay aside what he called , its rough policy , at least for the , tome being . Mr. Dulles ' main theme today , ! as at his news conference a week ago , was his advocacy of the : doctrine of the renunciation of military force as the cornerstone , of a rule of law and reason in international affairs . Recalling his statement last : April that the United States would not negotiate with Com- , rnunist China with a pistol atl its head , Mr. Dulles said that Peiping seemed now to have laid , : that pistol down . But what is equally , if not more important , ' he emphasized , was that the , ristol should be tossed aside for keeps as a means of influencing international events . Mr. Dulles ' discussion of Corn- : munist China was one of the : most searching he has yet made concerning the principles underlying the United States attitude toward the Communist regime . Defense Ties Reiterated He made it plain that the United States was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's positions on Formosa and the Chinese offshore islands . Nor did Mr. Dulles have in mind any weakening of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty . At the same time , he seemed to be outlining a course of action that , if progressively followed by Peiping , could lead to a completely ' new status for the Communist Government , The touchstone of this progressive procedure , he indicated , must . be renunciation of forced as an implement of policy . Such renunciation , he also indicated , , would bring its reward in the , form of a new status in the international community for the , Communist regime . Mr. Dulles said he believed ' that any country whose rulers lived up to the spirit of the ' United Nations Charter made ' itself eligible for talks on they topics about which civilized , countries-often deal . He did not attempt to spell out exactly how the reassurance he &ought; from Communist China might be obtained . That , he made clear , is a matter for the Chinese rulers themselves . However , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Peiping rather than as a fruit of diplomatic negotiation // between the United States and Communist China . In this approach Mr , Dulles apparently was gently closing the door on the suggestion by Mr. Chou for a Pacific pact . There was little in what Mr. Dulles said today to suggest that he was thinking along the lines of such a pact . The non-aggression statement , the Secretary said specifically , should " come about primarily as a declaration policy which leaders or the rulers of a country would make rather than as the subject of bilateral agreement . " " What we hope to arrive at by , progressive steps , " he added , " is a situation where the Chinese Communists will have renounced the use of force to achieve their , ambitions . " While Mr. Dulles offered no support for the idea of a ChineseUnited States " peace pact " for ' Asia , he did abandon the customary sharp tone of his refer- , ences both to Mr. Chou and tol the Chinese Communists . Hel said he was " very glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dulles ' statement on the desirability of peaceful settlements of differences . Tone of Speech Cited thought in general , " Mr. Dulles said , " the tone of the speech indicated his going further in the renunciation of force than anything he had said before . " " The release of the fliers , " Mr. Dulles said , " the release of the civilians , if it comes about , such statements as are made by Chou En-lai , if I interpret them right and if they are sincere and permanent parts of policy , might mark the beginning of a new phase in Chinese Communist re , lations with the rest of the world . " While Mr. Dulles was in a more mellow mood toward Communist China , he continued to shy away from specific suggestions that the current discussions by Ambassadors of the United States and Red China in Geneva might prove to be the preliminary to talks of wider scope in which he and Mr. Chou would meet face to face . He pictured the discussions in Geneva as of more or less limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions as the release of Americans held by , the Chinese . Mr. Dulles revealed that Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson was , submitting to Peiping 's representative , Wang Ping-nan , a list , of about 500 members of the , United States armed forces , missing in the Korean war , whose fate was still not precisely known . There is said to be very little chance that any of these men are still alive . While Mr. Dulles did not say it in so many words , he talked about the forty American civilians listed by the State Department as held by Communist China in a fashion that suggested he was confident of early positive action for their release . Broader Parley Hinted However , Mr. Dulles did not rule out the possibility of broader Geneva discussions resulting from action by the Chinese to introduce other topics of discus- ' sion . In connection with what Communist China might expect in ' return for renouncing force as a means of policy , Mr. Dulles said , the United States could not be ' expected to act as an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying principle of the alliance between Nationalist China and the United , States involved the renunciation of force . He said that all United States military agreements explicitly provided that equipment must not be used for aggressive purposes . He specifically noted that this proviso applied to South , Korea and to a South Korean , declaration of a desire to recover areas south of the Thirty-eighth Parallel . Mr. Dulles said the United States was not prepared to trade abandonment of the Southeast Asian defense accord for renunciation of force by Communist China . He asserted that the accord was just as vital to the United States as the North Atlantic pact . " We are absolutely convinced that these collective security organizations are in the interest of peace , " he said . " Even if socalled tensions between the East and West were totally resolved , I believe that this type of organization should persist and , that that marks the enlightened future which we should seek . " Nor did the Secretary offer much hope to Communist China that by laying aside the pistol ? , permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to talk its way into possession of Formosa and ' the Chinese offshore islands .
