MAIN LINE ( 313 pp. ) - Livingston Biddle Jr. - Julian Messner ( $3 ) . <P> In its day , the Philadelphia Main Line was perhaps the most splendid suburb since Louis XIV 's real-estate development at Versailles . That day is past . Many of the estates have been broken into petty parcels , many of the great homes torn down or converted into genteel academies . The grandsons of the great generation have not exactly returned to shirtsleeves , but they are catching the 8:24 instead of the 9:35 . <P> Yet the social and moral order of the Main Line lingers , as a good upper will outwear its sole . Many of the old families have bravely kept up the appearance of a world long after its death . They are the members of a social body that proudly awaits its Proust . He may never come , but the Main Line will at least have had its Biddle . <P> He is Livingston Biddle Jr. , 31 , of the Main Line 's very own Biddies , a great-great-grandson of Banker Nicholas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of onetime Attorney General Francis Biddle and of Sculptor George Biddle , and the author of Main Line , a new novel that attempts to explain the society which produced him. * <P> Best Ivy . Like many princelings of the Biddle blood , Livingston grew up on the Main Line ( in Bryn Mawr ) and was educated among the very best ivy ( at Princeton ) . Then he turned his back on leisure , took a job as copy boy at the Philadelphia Bulletin . After the war , in which he served as an ambulance driver , Livingston wrote a novel and 30 short stories , " threw them all in the Schuylkill River .

It is a pretty good one , well organized , carefully if stiffly written , and sincere in tone . It manages with very few means to convey the musty gloom of the old Main Line houses , and to suggest that the gloom may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the reek of decaying personalities . <P> Best Friend 's Wife . Yet Main Line is far less than an adequate analysis of its subject , and something less than a good novel . For one thing , Novelist Biddle seems too fuzzy-fond of his world to see it clearly . For another , his story is a little too pat to be believable : a scion of one of the first families runs off with his best friend 's wife ; their noses are thoroughly rubbed in the mess they have made by both families and by most of their friends ; then , gradually , family &; friends forgive them . <P> Novelist Biddle also has small success at creating character . All his young people talk as if they had read a book to learn how . Still , in its seriousness and workmanly care , Main Line is a moderately promising first novel-though it scarcely promises a novelist .

Back in 1927 , Francis Biddle knocked out a novel , The Llanfear Pattern , in which the upper-crust Philadelphia hero tries to be a social rebel , finds it too much for his well-conditioned conventions . + A custom which , if generally followed by Philadelphia writers , may partly account for the notorious taste of Philadelphia 's drinking water .
