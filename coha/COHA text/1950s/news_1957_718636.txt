Everything points again to a late March wind-up , mad with the , confusion of hasty , in-considered law-making unless the leadership , more than ever divided within itself , improves pace and tinting , Nevertheless , one major milepost has been passed with completion of the principal budget legislation , which is a signal for the homestretch drive . Politics again invaded the budget-making process . The Republican majority cut nearly $11 , - 000,000 from the Harriman budget . Some of this will go back in as supplementary action is taken . Thus the Republicans get credit for " economy ' . in one headline , then for " generosity " later . Part of this is achieved by playing a cat-andmouse game with New York City 's requests . The city has a good case in logic and equity for some of its items , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid for higher education and help on infirmary care of indigent Patient ..

The Republican leadership can not defend as responsible a 540,000,000 reduction from the .. normai " rate of conection of income taxes , nor can Governor Harriman responsibly accept such a reduction . We remind the Republicans that the people of this state expect not only prudent spending but also the avoidance of borrowing . The Republicans have set a generous course en spending , more generous in some respects than the Governor . On the other hand , they want to delay the day of reckoning . The party that built up and so long guarded a post-war construetion fund , that for so many years supported Dewey pay-as-we-go financing of publicimprovements , that prides itself on fiscal soundness , now flounders in inconsistency . It prepares for future borrowing of 5100 , - 000,000 for highway construction , for $250,000,000 in borrowing for State University expansion , It cuts taxes , it refuses thus far to go along with a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for everything that it thinks popular , anything that might help elect a Governor next year ; it is against levying the taxes that go with its bide for public favor .

Big jobs and big arguments lie ahead , A salary increase and other benefits for state employes should be passed ; this , at a cost of nearly $20,000,000 , is an instance where the Republicans have shown a generous hand . Social security should be extended to all public employes . Increased benefits for the unemployed and the disabled ill are desirable . Bills for ' further Waterfront reform have a good chance of passage ; they should pass . The Senate , with Walter J. Mahoney in Republican command , is the question mark on the needed perfection of compulsory automobile insurance . The loopholes most he closed .

This weakness might well be remedied , however , by further measures . ?  - -  - The United gates is already discussing with other maritime powers a joint declaration proclaiming the Strait of Tiran to be international waters open to the shipping of all nations , including Israel . . Should Egypt then attempt to stop Israeli ships it would be guilty of aggression and Israel would have the right of self-defense . ?
