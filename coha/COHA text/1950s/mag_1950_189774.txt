One of the last wishes of the late Richard Strauss was that Kirsten Flagstad should be the soprano to introduce the four songs which he finished in 1948 , the year before his death at 85 ( TIME , Sept. 19 ) . " I would like to make it possible , " he wrote to her , " that the songs should be at your disposal for a world premiere in the course of a concert with a first-class conductor and orchestra . " In London last week Composer Strauss 's wish was fulfilled to the letter . <P> With Albert Hall packed for the occasion , great-domed German Conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler stepped to the podium to lead London 's Philharmonia Orchestra . Plump and majestic , Soprano Flagstad took her place near his side , solemnly donned spectacles to read the music . What followed was a moving and deliberate farewell from a composer who , in his earlier years , had turned out the rich and masterful scores of Der Rosenkavalier , Death and Transfiguration , Don Quixote . <P> Sung as only Flagstad can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Four Last Songs ( Going to Sleep , September , Spring , At Sunset ) , were echoes of the old composer 's most mellow and memorable days . They spoke of a calm tiredness , deep autumnal peace , affection for his wife . At Sunset ended with a quiet and resigned interrogation : " Is this perhaps death ? " As the last soft sounds died in the orchestra , one listening musician said , " What an epitaph to write for oneself ! " <P> For the unveiling of the epitaph , Londoners could thank Sir Sri Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar Bahudar , the wealthy , 30-year-old Maharaja of Mysore . Though he could not be present , the music-loving maharaja had put up a $4,800 guarantee for the performance , so that The Four Last Songs could be recorded for his fabulous ( now 20,000 records ) personal collection and shipped off to him in Mysore.
