" Frank , " ad-libbed Arthur Godfrey to Tenor Frank Parker on Godfrey 's morning radio and TV show one day last week , " how many times do you think you ought to warn a man that if he 's drunk on the job you 'll fire him ? " Replied Parker , " I think he should get a couple of warnings , and then that would be it . ' ' Said Godfrey : " I fired a man yesterday that I told the last time , which was the seventh time , that I would n't take it again . " <P> The Great Friendly Face turned into the cameras to elaborate . The Godfrey company , he said , includes " two or three characters who are hitting that bottle too hard . " Drunkenness is " the one thing that I will not tolerate on this program . . . Just for the record , I want it to be known , if you ever see one of them missing , that 's why . " <P> This new public airing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hearst papers that Godfrey was in a firing mood because of intramural romancing among members of his cast . For this charge Godfrey had a grandly Godfreudian reply : " There is no girl on this show whose job is in jeopardy . . . I do n't give a hoot who they 're in love with , who they marry , who they divorce , who they have babies with . . . I just hope that if they do , it 's with their husbands . . .
