One evening last week the men of the Jordan border town of Kalkilya sat in cafes sipping coffee and playing backgammon . From Israel 400 yards to the west came the clatter of heavy vehicles and the flicker of headlights . A column of trucks lurched past the loungers . " Do n't worry , " an officer called out . " You wo n't get hurt . We 're after the army . " A moment later the street shook as the Israelis opened their attack on the big police fort on the other side of town . It was another Israeli reprisal raid , the fourth in a month . This one was in retaliation for two Israeli farm hands whom Jordanian guerrilla raiders killed in an orange grove across from Kalkilya , lopping off their victims ' ears as trophies . <P> Unexpected Casualties . This time the Israeli attack did not go quite as planned . It took nearly two hours to capture and blow up the fort . Troops trying to take it by frontal assault across flat ground crisscrossed with barbed wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief . Canada 's Major General E.L.M . Burns , called for a ceasefire at midnight , the Israelis rejected it because , as a spokesman admitted later , " we were n't through yet . " At that time , Israeli forces sent to block off reinforcements ran into a tough fight five miles east on the Samaritan road . For their first big thrust since 1949 , the Arab Legion ( rechristened the Jordanian army since King Hussein threw out Glubb <P> Pasha ) sailed into action to help the beleaguered frontier guards . The Israeli ambushers killed 13 Jordanians in one truck . But they could not break off action until they brought up artillery , and heavy guns were firing over the border along a ten-mile front . Windows shook in Tel Aviv , 20 minutes away to the west . At Kalkilya shells rained both on the fort and the town , killing a nursing infant , his brother , an old woman . By 4:20 the Israelis finally pulled out . This time when they crossed the border they did not cheer or sing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight was broken off , an Israeli army spokesman announced that Israel 's forces had lost 18 dead and 12 wounded . U.N . observers counted 48 Jordanians known dead . " Poor arithmetic to suffer so many casualties to avenge so few , " said a disgruntled Israeli .
