txt Liberalized pension benefits are on the way for Massachusetts state and local public employees . Designed to encourage employees to remain in service longer , the plan is being counted on to produce long-run savings of substantial importance to the pension system 's financial stability . Already passed by the Legislature , it is now awaiting action on minor amendments proposed by Governor Furcolo before signing it into law . It offers greater benefits for those who retire on superannuation . It is planned as a means of encouraging public employees to ignore opportunities for disability retirements on questionable grounds and to make it unnecessary for workers to seek early retirement so as to take outside employment to build up social-security benefits . With the measure nearly ready for the statute books , new efforts are being exerted to push through another bill designed to discourage questionable disability pensions . Under fire are workers who got disability pensions for pernianent and total disability and then work in outside jobs at least as strenuous as those from which they were retired . Retroactivity Sought Long in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disability pensioners by a corresponding amount when the total of their pension and outside earnings exceeds the current salary of the position from which they retired . The Senate has insisted the measure be retroactive to cover those now on disability pensions . The House has stood fast in demanding that it affect only those retiring in the future . Representative Charles A. Anthony ( R ) of Haverhill , recognized authority on pensions , expects the conference committee to favor the House version . While . Senator Philip A. Graham ( R ) of Hamilton , who coauthored the bill with Mr. Anthony , is insisting that the Senate version be adopted , Mr. Anthony believes the Senate may agree to the House version . Petition Planned Senator Graham is already developing a statewide organization to circulate an initiative petition the result of which would be to place the issue on the 1958 state ballot . He insisted the initiative petition would be sought if the disability-pension curb is not made retroactive or if the Legislature once again kills the entire legislation . The other measure , boosting superannuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay on the job long and shorten the period when the governmental unit must pay a pension and a salary on the same job . Under the measure , a worker 's pension would be based on 2.5 per cent of his average salary in his highest five years for each year of service at age 65 years and over , on the first $7,500 of his salary . Those averaging over $7,500 would receive an extra pension ar two-fifths of their regular annuity contributions on that part . of their salary above $7,500 a year . The maximum pension would remain at 80 per cent . System Altered Those persons retiring prior to age 65 would suffer a pension reduction of one-tenth of 1 per cent for each year below 65 . The 2.5 formula would begin at age 60 for policemen , firefighters , and other workers in hazardous employment , with the one-tenth of 1 per cent downward graduation taking effect below that age . A major purpose of the pending change is to provide a more equitable pension for persons retiring between the ages of 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on a percentage of the employee 's contribution into the pension system and other factors . But . the system was thrown out of balance a few years ago when the Legislature provided that a person 65 years of age with 20 years ' service shall get a pension of half the first $5,000 of average salary in his two highest years - plus. 2 per cent for each year over 20 . On the part of his salary over $5,000 he receives an additional pension of 40 per cent of his annuity contributions . Inequities Noted Mr. Anthony explained that the present plan based on contributions into the system produces smaller . benefits because a . substantial portion of a present worker 's services was in a comparatively low salaried period . The legislation has been supported by the Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Association ; the Massachusetts Contributory Retirement Boards Association , which originally sponsored the measure ; John J. Manning , secretary of the State Board of Retirement ; the Massachusetts State Employees Association ; the Massachusetts State Council of State , Cattily , and Municipal Employees ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts School Superintendents Association .
