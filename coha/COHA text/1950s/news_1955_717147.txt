txt Sensational displays of Soviet air might are flashing through Moscow skies this week in preparation for Soviet Air Force Day June 19 . Supersonic fighters have been seen for the first time . Turboprop and pure jet intercontinental bombers and large numbers of all-weather fighters have been glimpsed leaving vapor trails over the city . But Western air observers assume that the most spectacular display will be the new twin-rotored helicopters . capable of carrying 60 to 70 men each . Among the new hitherto unseen craft are three four-turboprop bombers which are believed to be capable of intercontinental flights . Moreover , Western air attaches have now observed 11 pure jet intercontinental bombers , the same as the spectacular prototype unveiled earlier . The westerners forecast that the Soviets would bring out their big helicopters in large numbers . The biggest one was described as a dual-rotored machine comparable to the largest British or American helicopters . Nothing similar has been seen publicly in the Soviet Union before .                  @ @ @
