And if ye are apprehensive that ye shall not deal fairly with orphans , then , of other women , who seem good in your eyes , marry but two , or three , or four , and if ye still fear that ye shall not act equitably , then one only . - Mohammed , in the Koran <P> The men of Indonesia might worry about the final count in the new recent nip-and-tuck election : the women were far more exercised about " that woman of Solo . " <P> " That woman " is Heriati Hartini Suwondo , the lissome divorcee that President Soekarno secretly married over a year ago . The women had not minded when Soekarno divorced his first wife for cause-childlessness-and took a new wife , Fatmawati , in 1942 . Fatmawati bore him two boys and two girls , and took her place as the nation 's First Lady . But Hartini was something else again . <P> Soekarno met Hartini in 1953 during a ceremonial visit to Solo , in Central Java . Long before , according to the outraged ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five children . In the months that followed , Hartini was rarely at home , and Indonesian society clattered with talk of the President 's clandestine romance . A year ago , a leading women 's organization circulated a letter to women 's clubs charging that Soekarno had married his girl . Only then did Soekarno admit that he had taken Hartini as a second wife in June 1954 , and claimed that she had been divorced long before he met her . The women , suspecting Hartini 's reputation , promptly dug out the fact that Hartini 's divorce was not entered officially until April 1954 . Moslem law requires the elapse of three menstrual periods before a divorced woman can remarry . Thus , the ladies calculated , Hartini had violated Moslem law . Soon she was delivered of a son . <P> Even then the women might have subsided if Hartini had been content to accept the modest status of second wife . But she briskly moved her whole Solo household and her five children into Bogor Palace , began to entertain old friends , receive officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Lady , while Fatmawati shrank into the background . Whenever Soekarno traveled , Hartini traveled with him . <P> In protest , the women organized deliberate snubs . During the recent election campaign , the women sent delegations to greet Soekarno . But when Hartini stepped down from the plane , the delegation would turn and march off . They waited on officials , demanding that they snub her . To one irate delegation , Premier Harahap explained that on one occasion he had intended only to shake hands with the President . But Hartini determinedly went up to him with outstretched hand . " What could I do but accept her hand ! " bleated Harahap.
