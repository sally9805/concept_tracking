Gold balances were down again last month , and Britain 's trade gap was still widening . The cost of living inched higher , helped by a penny rise in bread prices . The 20,000 reservists called to the colors because of the Suez crisis were restive and kicking up trouble in Cyprus and Malta military camps , and barracks at home . Millions of Englishmen were disgruntled at the course of Suez . Tories themselves were grumbling about their leaders . " We want more Conservatism , more quickly , " cried fire-breathing Conservative Peter Emery of Reading , " and more guts in leadership ! " <P> <P> In that unpropitious atmosphere , the leaders of Britain 's government collected in the North Wales resort town of Llandudno last week to face up to 4,200 Conservative Party members in their annual conference . <P> Kiss &; Rule . Leader after leader rose to explain what one protesting resolution called " the government 's apparent inability to reverse trends resulting from Socialist maladministration " and to " use its strong majority to implement more forcibly its election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandys pledged that he would decontrol 10 million rent-controlled houses . Chan cellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan delivered a lengthy appeal for his plan to take Britain into a new European free-trade area ( TIME , Oct. 15 ) . But by far the most ringing response to the rank and file 's complaints came from Lord Privy Seal R. A. Butler . <P> Just a year ago , ailing and deeply depressed by the death of his wife , and about to step down as Chancellor of the Exchequer , " Rab " had helped to make a tepid conference more tepid , and had lost his place in the leadership stakes to the debonair Macmillan . Now he bounced back with the kind of clear , practical talk that shaped the " New Toryism " with which the party won its way back to power in 1950 . With wit and humor , Rab Butler apprised the party of the ever-changing path to office : " In the Middle Ages you bullied your way to power . In the classical age you bribed your way to power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as readers of Pickwick Papers will recall , you kissed your way to power . Nowadays we are obliged to argue our way to power . " <P> " Prosperity politics " is not enough , said Butler . The Tory appeal must rest on two " main and realistic principles " : 1 ) " To wield the power of the state to balance the interests within it , producing a society in which rewards go to those who are successful in increasing the wealth of the whole , and so make it possible to help others who are in need " ; and 2 ) " So to organize our international and defense policies as to hold our position in the world .
