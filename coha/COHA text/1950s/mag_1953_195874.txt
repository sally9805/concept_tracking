STORIES IN THE MODERN MANNER ( 282 pp. ) - Edited by Philip Rahv and William Phillips-Avon ( 35 ) . <P> The publishers of Avon Books ( price range : 25 to 35 ) sell more than 20 million , copies a year , chiefly by serving up westerns , whodunits and the kind of boy-meets-girl story that can be illustrated by a ripe cheesecake jacket . Occasionally , however , Avon offers a change of diet , and its latest , Stories in the Modern Manner , is an adventure in highbrow smorgasbord : 14 short stories and a one-act play from the literary bimonthly , Partisan Review . The editors never explain what the tag " modern manner " means , but most of these stories do have one thing in common : they are about the end of something-love , life , adolescence or illusion . <P> Crossing Paris , the first and longest tale , is by Marcel Ayme , a deft ironist who likes to pare the French mind and character like an apple . This time , in a story which takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper . Two thugs , Martin and Grandgil , are hired by a black-marketeer to tote four valises filled with meat across the city . Grandgil , a newcomer to the racket , is supposed to take orders from Martin , but right from the start he shows a shocking lack of honor . By threatening to expose the black-marketeer , he gets 5,000 francs instead of the agreed 450 for doing the job . As they move across town he tries to sell the meat piecemeal , picks fights in bistros , knocks a gendarme out cold and pockets his whistle . Irked by his incautious partner , Martin tries to pound some sense into Grandgil only to be tossed around like an Apache dancer . Thoroughly cowed , Martin agrees to rest for a few minutes in Grandgil 's flat . <P> To his surprise , it turns out to be a studio hung with canvases . Grandgil , the arch-tough , is a painter . When his girl friend phones , and he tells her , " I disguised myself as a gangster . . . it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says , " I know how to amuse myself with other people 's work , too . " and slashes a painting . When Grandgil leaps for him , he gets a knife in the belly . To the arresting police Martin says philosophically , <P> " We do n't do what we wish to do , believe me . " <P> Into Sunny Honeymoon Italy 's Alberto Moravia pours the heady wine of love and politics . Married two days and honeymooning on Capri , an increasingly testy husband finds his Communist bride continually fending him off . Worse still , she shows an easy sense of comradeship with a fellow party worker they meet on the island . Just when the unhappy husband has decided that he and his wife are politically incompatible , a helpful bolt of summer lightning melts her lovingly in his arms . <P> In George , Novelist Isaac Rosenfeld tells a memorable story of psychological exhibitionists at a Greenwich Village drinking party . When one of them , a girl named Gloria , turns into a physical exhibitionist by doffing all her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , saves what is left of decorum by making a circus-style departure that shakes even Gloria out of her pose . <P> And so it goes . The stories are a good sample of what Partisan Review has been offering to its choosy 5,800 subscribers since the war , and this in itself amounts to a certificate of modernity . For the drugstore trade , Avon has decorously dropped all cheesecake , jacketed the book in black .
