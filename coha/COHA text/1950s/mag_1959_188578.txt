The most fashionable portraitist now active is Ren Bouch ( rhymes with touch ) . He may also be the best . Last week at Manhattan 's Alexander Iolas Gallery , Bouch had on view a brilliant display of what his flickering , sweet-and-sour brush can do . Recent subjects : Truman Capote , Isak Dinesen , Anita Loos , Elsa Maxwell , Mrs. William Paley , the Duchess of Windsor , Lady Astor , the Duchess of Argyll and Alexander Calder . <P> A knowing sparrow of a man , Bouch often asks the glamorous and important to pose for his thin-stained canvases , gives them a drawing for their pains . Bouch 's technical equipment , like that of John Singer Sargent and Giovanni Boldini , is not prodigious , but exactly suits his ends . He may well rank with those past masters of social portraiture . Bouche is not one to portray the bellhop or the country maid , but flies straight to the inmost circle of society , where the crustiest tycoons really do unbend , all wives are beautiful , and well-tailored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lions and tigresses of a world often so polite that it is rude , and so frantic that it is bored . <P> " My style may be described as a kind of loving criticism , " he says . The criticisms are sometimes wrapped in flattery , as when he paints a gauzy profile of the Duchess of Windsor without those wrinkles that are the map of earned character . But Truman Capote he sees devastatingly as a lounging , feline figure , with a prim mouth and enormous cold spectacles . Elsa Maxwell becomes , in a spectacularly strong and concise portrait , a court dwarf out of Velasquez . Says Bouch : " A court jester , but also a desperately serious woman who considers herself a serious critic of society . " <P> The son of a prosperous French businessman , Bouch was born 54 years ago in Prague , traveled much in youth , early demonstrated a flair for art , and made his first big money with fashion drawings for the Paris Vogue . Now settled in Manhattan , he spends a third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait . He once dabbled in abstract expressionism , now pooh-poohs it : " I consider myself the avant garde , because nobody sings the song of the upper level of society today . Nobody speaks of the exceptional human being . "
