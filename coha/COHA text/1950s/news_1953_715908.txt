txt Kremlin denunciation of President Eisenhower 's offer for an international atomic pool dedicated to peaceful progress has come in record time . Usually- Takes Its Time The most recent case was the exchange of notes between the Kremlin and the western Big Three concerning a Big Four meeting to settle the German peace treaty anci the Austrian state treaty . Not only did Moscow take its time before replying to western requests , but it also was careful not to slam the door completely shut . It can he argued that the Moscow broadcast of Dec. 8 followed the same pattern , that it was a denunciation rather than a rejection . Even if that were the case  --  and there are several good reasons to doubt it  --  the speed of the Kremlin 's reaction remains a new and puzzling element . Explanation Sought The explanation can be found in ( 1 ) the difference in the . nature between Mr , Eisenhower 's proposal and the western request for a Big Four meeting , and ( 2 ) in the parallel offered by Soviet reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's acceptance Nov. 26 of a Big Four/ meeting in Berlin involved no Soviet concessions . It committed Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov , or whoever will represent the Soviet Union in Berlin . to nothing more than to sit down at , a table with his western opposite numbers . No admission would be implied by this action that Moscow recognized any merits of the well-known western plans for settling the German or Aus trian issues . In the case of Mr. Eisenhower 's atomic pool project , however , the situation is different . To sit down with western representatives would mean that the Kremlin considered the project feasible . It also would mean that the Soviet Union would accept the challenge to prove in peaceful competition that the Communist system was at least equal if not ) Iarshall Plan Recalled The iirst time such a challenge was put to the Kremlin was in 1947 , when the United States submitted the Marshall Plan to the world . At that time Moscow initially said yes  --  apparently because it did not grasp right away the challenge inherent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he was in for  --  a loosening of his grip not only on the satellite nations but possibly even strong repercussions within the Soviet Union itself ? he ordered Mr. Molotov to withdraw from the Paris conference . It seems reasonable to assume that . Mr. Malenkov , having learned the lesson of 1947 , decided this time to play safe and say " no " right at the beginning , His note may or may Hol , he a final one . He may reconsider after prolonged and intensive study of Mr. Eisenhower 's speech and probably after having privately asked for and received slime complementary information on some of the practical aspects of the atomic pool project . However , such a course does not seem very likely . It might be well for the West to get used to the idea that the Soviet Union will stay aloof horn the atomic pool . For if Moscow did ( ) the ' wise this would lead to a race i ) et woe ! ) East and West to move to the noncomm inert parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , and others ? whether the Soviet or the democratic system is in a better position to help them . It is most doubtful if the Kremlin , despite these repeated boastful pionuoutcenents to the contrary , would he willing to tp.ke this risk .
