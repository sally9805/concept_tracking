What happened to the lost Ten Tribes of Israel ? In the reign of Solomon 's son Rehoboam , the nation of Israel divided ; ten tribes broke away under the leadership of Jeroboam , * and two ( Juda and Benjamin ) remained to provide the subsequent history of the Jews . But the fate of the Ten Tribes is one of the persistent mysteries of history and a tempting lure for eager souls always waiting to rush into any vacuum of knowledge , armed with a ready-made theory and infinite capacity for inductive reasoning . In the past 100-odd years , a cult called British Israel , which estimates its membership in " hundreds of thousands , " most of them in Britain , the U.S. and the Commonwealth , has developed a rather startling theory about the missing tribes . <P> Jacob 's Stone of Scone . The lost tribes , say they , were captured and exiled by Sargon , King of Assyria , about 721 B.C. Assyrian records tell of a race called the " Khumri . " These , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks ' Cimmerioi and the Romans ' Cimbri , gave their name to such places as the Crimea , Cumberland and Cambria , and were also the Cymry ( pronounced Kum-ree ) , who originally settled in Wales . Other branches are supposed to have become the Scythians , or Scuthae , who populated Scotland , and the Sacae , or Saxons ( i.e. , Isaac 's sons ) . <P> Some members of the tribe of Dan ( the seafarers of Israel ) supposedly reached Ireland , where a certain Princess Tephi married one of their chieftains and founded the present royal family of Britain-making Queen Elizabeth II a lineal descendant of David . This Irish Israelite line is also thought to have preserved the stone Jacob used as a pillow . The stone , so goes the legend , was saved from the Jerusalem temple when it was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar , and taken to Ireland , thence to Scotland . Now it is the Stone of <P> Scone in Westminster Abbey , upon which all British monarchs are crowned . <P> British Israelites are partial to an unorthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hebrew . Thus bar ( son ) reappears in the British " bairn " ; peri ( fruit ) in " berry " ; katon ( little ) in " kitten . " The word " British " is simply a rendering of Berit-ish ( covenant man ) . <P> No Thunderclaps . Another " proof " of the British Israelites ' theory has been drawn from the Great Pyramid of Cheops . For centuries busy minds have marked off the passages inside the pyramid in a scale corresponding roughly to the calendar ( about one inch representing a year ) . Certain markings , turns and corners along the passages have been found to correspond with historical events , and were thus used for prophecies . World War I , the Depression and World War II have been recognized on this scale and passed ; dead ahead has loomed the most portentous date of all-the date upon which the pyramid 's main passage runs smack into a blank wall . On that date , the British Israelites predicted , would come " the final collapse of aggressive military systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and humanity as God 's sanctuary .
