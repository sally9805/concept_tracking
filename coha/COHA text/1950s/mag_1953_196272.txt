Arthur Godfrey , the one-man industry , is a proud , doting father to the " Little Godfreys " on his radio and TV shows . Before the mike and camera , he spoils them with praise ; behind the scenes , he boxes their ears when they get too big for their britches . <P> Last spring , bedded in Massachusetts General Hospital after his celebrated hip operation , Godfrey watched over his flock by television , decided that one of his Little Godfreys-chunky , curly-haired Baritone Julius La Rosa , 23 , an ex-bluejacket whose career he had launched two years ago-was getting a little cocky . He told CBS President Frank Stanton that Julius would get a good talking to . Fortnight ago , when Godfrey learned that La Rosa had flouted one of his rules by signing up with his own agent , he had a new report for the boss . " Arthur called me at home Saturday night , " said Stanton , " and told me he was going to let Julius go . We decided that instead of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just to tell everyone over the air . " Stanton added thoughtfully : " Maybe this was a mistake . " If it was a mistake , it was a lulu . <P> A Special Quality . Last week , on his first morning show , Godfrey waited until the very end before pulling off history 's most public firing . <P> Said he to his TV audience : " That was Julie 's swan song with us . He goes now out on his own , as his own star , soon to be seen in his own program , and I know you wish him Godspeed same as I do . Bye-bye ! " Godfrey 's abrupt sacking of Crooner La Rosa , which was news to Julius , was also a Page One story to newspapers across the country. * It was quickly made even juicier by the added information that Bandleader Archie Bleyer , 44 , a longtime Godfrey regular , had been fired the same day from the daytime and Wednesday shows , would work only eight weeks more on the Monday night Talent Scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did it . " When I take on a new entertainer , " he said , " I look for a special quality , kind of indefinable , but the nearest I can come is a form of humility . It has something to do with being lovable , likable and wholesome ... I go a little crazy over that quality . " That 's the way Julius had been , " a shy , bashful , scared-to-death kid . . . " <P> During the last year , as Godfrey told it , Julius began to change into an " obstreperous " boy . He eyed outside offers , lost interest in the ballet and tap-dancing exercises for the Godfrey cast . " Julius went completely berserk , haywire . " His signing with an agent was " the straw that broke the camel 's back . " <P> As for Archie Bleyer , said Godfrey , all choked up : " I love that man . He 's a gentleman . " But Archie , too , had lost his humility . Bandleader Bleyer had spent part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own record company and cutting some songs with the star of a rival network-ABC 's Don ( Breakfast Club ) McNeill . " It 's like being married to a woman for 20 years , " said Godfrey mournfully , " and then coming home and finding a cigar butt in the ashtray . "
