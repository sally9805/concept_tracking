Last week the young men of the Harvard Crimson made another bow to the inevitable encroachment of womankind , and for the first time elected a girl writer to their editorial board . Their choice came with well-established credentials . She is Alice Patterson Albright , 18 , redheaded Radcliffe freshman and a fifth-generation heir apparent to the famed Patterson-McCormick newspaper publishing dynasty of New York and Chicago . <P> Vibrant , unassuming Alice is the daughter of Chicago Painter Ivan Albright and Josephine Medill Patterson , youngest daughter of the late Captain Joe Patterson , founder of the New York Daily News . Alice 's Aunt Alicia Patterson , 52 ( TIME Cover , Sept. 13 , 1954 ) , is ' the editor and publisher of Long Island 's moneymaking , fast-growing tabloid Newsday ( circ. 288,483 ) . It is to Alice and her brother Joe , 21 , a reporter on the Chicago Sun-Times , that Aunt Alicia may hand down important interests in Newsday , the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune . <P> Alice began her journalistic career at twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As co-editor of the weekly four-page mimeographed Neighborhood News ( circ. 225 ) , she waged her first crusade against Chicago 's dirty streets and the sanitation department 's lethargic collection schedules . By selling ads to local merchants , Alice and a friend raised $25 , bought the city six new trash cans , and so shamefaced the aldermen that they appropriated $9,000 more for new cans , asked Alice for a list of street corners where she wanted them placed . <P> Unlike her Republican parents , Alice , who traveled to Russia last year in the party with Adlai Stevenson , an old family friend , considers herself " a Stevensonian Democrat , " but adds : " My political views are probably pretty immature . " Certain that she wants to go into the newspaper business but uncertain whether she will settle in Newsday territory ( " It 's hard to pick out a man that lives on Long Island " ) , Alice knows what kind of paper she would like to run : " The New York Times with guts .
