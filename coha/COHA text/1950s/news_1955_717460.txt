txt Calls for UN intervention a la Korea are met here with stony silence . First , because this is something that only President Eisenhower could decide to press for , and the President is not back on his feet enough to tackle problems so big with uncertainties , and of such scope . Also , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles is in Geneva . Second , because the last thing the United States wants to do is to dispatch an American expeditionary force anywhere . and the last thing it wants to see is anything that would formalize Soviet diplomatic and military entry into the Middle East . So proposals from London for UN action , proposals from Moscow for an international parley , meet no response here . The United States knows what it does not favor . It has not yet decided what it does favor . There are some in the capital who believe that the time now is ripe : or Mr. Eisenhower to seize the initiative in some dramatic action that would practically impose peace on the Middle East . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Greece and Turkey seemed about to collapse under Soviet pressure . They claim he saved the situation there with the Truman Doctrine and the aid to Greece and Turkey program . And they suggest that now is the time for Mr. Eisenhower to do something comparable as regards the Middle East  --  put the United States " frontier " in Palestine as it is in Mid-Europe and the Formosa strait . Same Result Seen If his blunt announcement that the United States would fight if Formosa were attacked is what has kept Peking from attacking ( as Mr. Dulles does not hesitate to assert ) then an equally blunt announcement that America 's vital interests lie in the Middle East should bring the same result . But any such decision would have grave and profound repercussions and would require constant study by the full member ' ship of the National Security Council . That body , however , is operating in low gear , since both the President and the Sec ! retary of State are out of Wash ington . And this Middle East crisis is not one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after the most thorough groundwork by all members . At present the three Western powers are standing on their 195() tripartite declaration against any change of Arab-Israel borders by force . But that declaration has no teeth to it . And now there are reports that Moscow is thinking of unilaterally joining itself to this declaration  --  thus putting the Soviet hallmark on Middle East peace as well . Charge and Reply Imagine what such proposals are doing to American officials  --  who want to keep the Soviet Union out of the Middle East diplomatically , economically , and militarily . The United States blames the Soviets and their satellites , particularly Czechoslovakia , for having heated up this warfare in the Middle East . As State Department officials put it , " the chronology of events " shows who is to blame . It was n't until after the Bed bloc offered arms to Egypt that the fighting flared up . The Soviets , of course , have their reply to this : That it was n't until the United States started nailing down treaties through the Mideast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diplomatic offensive . It is the goal of Soviet ambition that stirs Washington as much as anything else . And it causes a situation that demands the attention of Mr. Eisenhower , which fortunately he should be able to give it soon . Last November the economic flank was under the command of a general who wanted very much to extend it . That was when Harold E. Stassen believed that the rising danger was on the economic , rather than on the military , front and proposed to extend the flank to the tune of a multibillion dollar aid program for underdeveloped countries of Southern Asia and the Middle East . Not only was the Stassen project stopped cold by Secretary of the Treasury George M. Humphrey , but Mr. Stassen himself was shortl relieved of his command and given disarmament as his new field of activity . The foreign aid budget for this year was then written by those who disagreed with Mr. Stassen , and put in the hands of Mr. Hollister who , on returning from a survey tour this week , said he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hopeful of further cuts this year . Soviets Poise Over Egypt Mr. Hollister may be unworried , but the State Department is grappling with the imminent conclusion of an agreement between Moscow and Caieo under which Moscow would provide $600,000,000 worth of technical assistance and structural materials for the construction of the Nile River development project which , if signed , would come fairly close to making Egypt a colony of the Soviet Union . ? The sale of Czech arms to Egypt now looks like no more than a sort of pilot operation subordinate to the far vaster economic tie which would ensue if Egypt signed up for a 30-year loan which would mean Soviet technicians swarming over Cairo and the whole Nile valley for the indefinite future . The Moscow ruble offensive is not limited " to Egypt . Soviet technicians now are paving the streets of Kabul , Afghanistan , and the city 's skyline is dominated by a Soviet-built oil refinery . Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin and Communist Party Secretary Nikita S. Khrushchev are scheduled to visit Kabul later this year . When Burmese Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington when he was kept waiting in the outer office of Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson , he pointedly thanked the Soviets for saving his country 's economy by buying its surplus rice at the world market price . Negotiations are under way for the construction of a steel mill by the Soviets in India , on terms more favorable than India has been offered by Western countries . In brief , Moscow has turned to ruble diplomacy at a time when Washington is doing its best to get out of the dollar diplomacy business . The Moscow operation follows logically after the Bandung ( Indonesia ) Conference where China , acting there on behalf of the Communist bloc , paved the way for closer relations with the underdeveloped regions of South Asia and the . Middle East . Nile Project Weighed None of this shook Washington until word came in of the Nile River development project for Egypt . Then the story began to change . The World Bank , in collaboration with sections of the British and United States Government , has been studying the Nile project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed . the biggest operation of this kind in history  --  much bigger than Tennessee Valley Authority or the irrigation system which once made Babylon the metropolitan center of the Middle East . Western estimates are that the total cost of the project would run to $1,200,000,000 . Its scope is suggested by the fact that it would require the resettlement of 35,000 Egyptian families in the Sudan . Western plans have never yet found a way to get around the problem of funding the cost on a sound business basis . There is little market for the cotton and rice of the Nile Valley in the Western World . Trading Position The Soviet Union moves into this situation from a favorable trading position . It does need the cotton and rice of Egypt and proposes to take payment for construction of the dams in these commodities . It is difficult to see how the conclusion of such an Egyptian-Soviet undertaking could be anything less , in certain respects , than the Soviet Union taking the place in Egypt one occupied by Britain . The United States could , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatidn to keep Moscow off the Suez land bridge which is the ancient highway from Eurasia into Africa . But it would have to be done on a political , rather than on a strictly business basis . There would be a dollar loss on the operation which would have to be added to the foreign aid budget over many years .. One theory in diplomatle quarters is that this represents a Moscow reply to Mr. Dulles ' Middle East defense pact which was recently concluded when Iran announced that it would join the alliance with Britain ; Turkey , Iraq , and Pakistan . That alliance presumably closed the chain around the Soviet Unidif . But it is a military chain and appears to be easily permeable by rubles , cement , steel , and Czech guns . Ruble diplomacy has taken the offensive in the Middle East and as yet there is no Western answer . In view of all this , the stalemate at Geneva over Germany was overshadowed and all ' but forgotten in Western chancelleries this week . It had been anticipated and was no surprite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
