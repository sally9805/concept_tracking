txt Manufacturers of consumer durable goods were promised they 'll be handed regular rations of steel , copper and aluminum . if they ca n't buy this metal in the normal way . The promise came from Manly Fleischmann. head of the National Production Authority , at a meeting of several hundred businessmen to discuss supplies of these metals for the third quarter . Mr. Fleischmann said these manufacturers ? they make evert ' me from kitchen cabinets to baby buggies fad venetian blinds  --  will be allowed about 70% as much steel and 60% as much copper and aluminum as they were using in the first half of last year . The consumer durable goods people are limited for the second quarter to 80% of pre-Korean steel usage . Copper use is restricted to 70% and aluminum has been cut back 65% or 50% depending on the type of product . Auto Firms Meet Separately Auto makers were not at the big meeting . In a separate session they were told they 'll be held in the third quarter to 65% of the steel they were using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 , but an adjustment will be made for Chrysler , which suffered a strike in that base period . Limits on the auto makers for use of copper and aluminum will be 60% and no , , respectively . At pi cent steel for autos Is limited to SO , , of the average monthly use in the first half of 19:41 and the industry has been orderod already to cut down to 75% in June . P.A. men suggested a double-barrelled nic.iiod of applying the 65% limit on steel for autos in the third quarter . The plan was to let the companies make only 65% of the nurnscr of nee. ? cars produced in the base period . But if they shifted to lighter models . they , ould exceed this unit limit , provided they use no more than 65% of the pre-Korean tonnage of steel . Tire industry men said they did n't like the unit limit and preferred a simple rule limiting steel tonnage . The argument was not settled . N.F A. officials also suggested there may be enough aluminum and steel to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the policy laid down hby Mobilization Eoss Charles Wilson provides for a ' good size " output of goods for civilians . in ? luding the consumer durables . But the present plan is not to give them any specific rations of metal under the Controlled Materials Plan . Rather , they 'll be left to buy . in the regular manner , the amounts of metal they 're allowed to use according to the limitation orders N.P.A. issues . Special C.M.P. rations will only go . at the start . to the military and certain " defense-supporting " groups , already getting help from N.P.A .. like the freight car builders , ship builders . petroleum and power industries . machine tool and farm machinery makers . Would Bring Firms Under C.M.P. Limits set for production of all types of metal products , including these preferred groups . are supposed to bring supply and demand for metal into - approximate balance .

In theory , there should be enough unrationed or " free " metal left over to keep production of consumer durables up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds it impossible to get the permitted amounts of metal . N.P.A. will be ready and willing to bring them di ' rectly under and give them dennite rations . too . " Amounts of material we esti/ mate can be made available for consumer durables will be made available , - the N.P.A. chief promised . " If you ca n't get it , we want to know about it , " he said The basic decisions on the limits to be set and the rations to be handed out to the preferred groups were made by the Defense Production Administration . Mr. Fleischmann told the manufacturers . But he added . " The books are not closed . " Before the big meeting broke up into small groups to discuss how the percentage limits would affect individual lines . the Administrator promised that N.P.A. will consider any complaints from industries that think they 're being limited too severely or that the " procedure is wrong . " Ad , nistments will be sought from D P.A .. if N P.A. thinks the complaints are valid . Some Ask " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to have to rely on buying so-called " free " metal and would rather have definite allotments from N.P.A. under the C.M.P. at the start . Mr. Fleischmann also warned the manufacturers a shortage of scrap metal may hamper steel production later this year . He urged the consumer durable industries to " stimulate " the flow of scrap metal back to ; the mills , noting that a reserve of scrap must be built up this summer or the mills will have " serious difficulties next winter " Behind closed doors . businessmen opened up on the proposed limits . Sonic groups said it was n't fair to use the first half of 1950 as a basis for limiting them . because their output was below par in that period Makers bicycles and children s vehicles said they do 70% of their business in the last half of the year . So they wanted N.P.A. to apply the 70% limit on steel , 60% on copper , and 50% on aluminum to their output in the last six months of 1950. instead of the first six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Death Sentence " Lawn-mower companies , limited in May and June to 50% of the pre-Korean usage of aluminum , said this rule amounts to a " death sentence " for them . From N.P.A. officials they got a glimmer of hope that special relief may be given to keep them alive . The N.P.A. men said they were trying to avoid any action that might result in a " death sentence " for any segment of any industry . That promise was made also to the furniture manufacturers . They complained of a " buyers ' market " in furniture in the first-half of 1950 base period and asked for " greater flexibility " In particular they wanted greater leeway to switch from one type of furniture to another : in that way , they would cut down on metal used in lines that are hardest to sell , they explained . N P.A. told the furniture companies  --  and apparently this rule will apply to others also ? that those concerns that make wood products using only small amounts of metal , will get exemptions . An order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use no more than five tons of carbon steel , a half ton of alloy steel , 500 pounds of copper , and 500 pounds of aluminum per quarter . The pre-Korea base period was criticized by the manufacturers of utensils and cutlery . They said their output was depressed In the first half of last year , because of seasonal trends , shutdowns , and " other difficulties , " an N P.A spokesman reported Choice of Periods Sought This group wanted permission to choose any consecutive six months between June 30 , 1949 , and June 30 , 1950 , as a basis for applying the cut-backs . N.P.A. told the utensil companies and also the makers of household appliances they may be given a choice of the last half of 1949 or the first half of 1950 as a base period . The makers of aluminum cooking utensils were especially worried about the 50 , " , limit for them . They predicted " serious unemployment " as a result . Companies making radios , television sets and lamps wanted a revision in the base period They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But N.P.A men asked this industry to be patient : once the agency rules on how much metal will go to the military and preferred groups the mills will be more willing to accept orders for metals from other industries , the officials said .
