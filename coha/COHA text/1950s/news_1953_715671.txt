Mayor Impellitteri had to admit that himself . " Mr. Gerosa 's mention of Mayor Impellitteri was a reference to the tribute the Mayor had paid to Mr. Flynn at the annual dinner of the Bronx Democratic organization in May . Proud To Be a ' Politician ' Although Mr. Flynn referred to himself on many occasions as " a politician " and took pride in the label , he was almost the opposite of the popular conception of a political boss . Urbane , college-educated , articulate , he was more at home in the sedate atmosphere of the White House , or in his own luxurious law office on East Fortysecond Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by remote control . But from 1928 on , when Franklin D. Roosevelt became Governor , and James J. Walker as Mayor began carrying out a policy of recognizing the Bronx as an important political entity , Mr , Flynn was one of the most powerful leaders in the state . Leader of Bronx County since 1922 , he was also Democratic National Committeeman from New York and Democratic National Chairman . The latter post he held for almost four years , starting with Mr. Roosevelt 's third-term campaign for the Presidency in 1940 , when James A. Palley resigned the post . He was selected by President Roosevelt , he revealed in his book , " You 're the Boss , " to secure the nomination of Harry S. Truman for Vice President in 1944 , without revealing Mr. Roosevelt 's hand in the maneuver . He eventually had to bring the President into the picture , however , to get all the other leaders in line . His book , published in 1947 , was a candid picture of the " boss " system of machine politics , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twoparty system while putting it up to the enrolled voters of the major parties to make the system work honestly and decently . Diplomatic Job Blocked Mr. Flynn , generally recognized as leader of a cleaner political machine than most , was blocked from becoming Minister to Australia , when that was a highly important post during the second World War , because of an incident which presented him publicly as a petty grafter . It involved the use , of several hundred dollars worth of old paving blocks and city ) labor to refurbish a courtyard on his Lake Mahopac estate . Actually ' the work had been arranged for without his knowledge , and the affair came to light only when he sought advice from city officials as to how he could pay for ! it . However , it served to block his confirmation by the Senate , and President Roosevelt withdrew the nomination at Mr. Flynn 's request . The latter had meanwhile resigned as Democratic National Chairman , National Committeeman from New York and Bronx County leader . His career seemed finished , but instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over control of the New York State Democratic organization from adherents of Mr , Farley . He and the late Frank V. Kelly , Brooklyn Democratic leader , obtained the-election of Paul E. Fitzpatrick as Mr , Farley 's successor as State Chairman and , after Mr. Kelly 's death , Mr. Flynn outranked all others in state affairs . In 1947 Mr. Flynn bought a large farm in Maryland , and began spending much time there breeding horses . Ete also maintained his association with Monroe Goldwater in the law firm of Goldwater &; Flynn . A longtime personal friend of eresident Roosevelt , Mr. Flynn was picked by the President to succeed Mr. Farley as National Chairman because of the necessity of naming another Roman Catholic . Until the paving block incident , he performed the duffed of that office adequately . Member of Bronx Triumvirate Mr. Flynn was born in New York on Sept. 22 , 1891 , the son of Henry T. and Sarah Mallon Flynn . As a member of a well-to-do family , he bad educational advantages . Mr. Flynn 's first distinction was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was admitted to the bar when only 21 years old , and eventually became a member of the law firm of , Goldwater &; Flynn . His career in public office began in 1917 , when he was elected to the , Assembly , in which he served fort three years . In 1921 he was elected , Sheieff of Bronx County . While in that office , he received from . Fordham the degree of Doctor of Laws at the hands of Cardinal Hayes . Mr. Flynn was only 32 when Arthur H. Murphy , Bronx Democratic leader , died , and , in the factional difficulties that followed , a triumvirate , consisting of Mr. Flynn , Stephen B. Nugent and Thomas H. O'Neill , was set up to guide the Bronx organization . The triumvirate did not work well , and each of its members became a candidate for the leadership . Mr. Flynn had the support of a bare majority of the Assembly district leaders , but every effort to elect him leader was foiled by the district leaders opposed to him and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened , thus preventing an election . Tired of what he regarded an impossible situation that was hurting the party , Mr. Flynn called upon the late Charles F. Murphy , then leader ok Tammany , and asked him to help end such " nonsense . " Mr. Murphy advised Mr. Flynn to go . back to the Bronx ands have another meeting of the executive committee , adding that hey thought " everything would be all , right . " The meeting of the executive committee was held , and Mr. Flynn elected . Ally of Tammany Mr. Flynn continued to be an ally of Tammany during the rest of Mr. Murphy 's leadership and during that of George W. Olvany , who succeeded Mr. Murphy . In 1925 , when Alfred E. Smith , then Governor and at the height of his political power , started the movement to prevent the renomination of Mayor John F. Hylan , Mr. Flynn never wavered in his support of that movement , and his Bronx organization contributed largely to the victory of Mr. Walker over Mayor Hylan in the contest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mayor was to appoint Mr. Flynn City Chamberlain . Mr. Flynn relinquished this post on Jan. 1 , 1929 , to become Secretary of State by appointment of Governor Roosevelt . Mr. Roosevelt 's election as Governor by a plurality of more than 700,000 had made him an outstanding contender for the Presidential nomination , and his appointment of Mr. Flynn was attributed at the time to his desire to have an influential supporter and adviser in this city . Mr. Flynn , who succeeded Robert Moses , served as Secretary of State through the two Roosevelt administrations and through the first two administrations of Governor Lehman . He and Mrs. Flynn were frequently hosts to the Roosevelts and the Lehmans at their Lake Mahopac home , and after Mr. Roosevelt 's election as President were entertaiend frequently at Hyde Park and the White House . Mr. Flynn 's break with Tammany took place soon after the resignation of Mr. Olvany as leader and the election of John F. Curry as his successor . At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1932 , he worked with Mr. Farley for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curry supported Mr. Smith . He again opposed Mr. Curry at the Democratic State Convention by supporting Mr. Lehman for the nomination for Governor , who also was favored by both Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Smith . The breach between the Bronx Flynn organization and Tammany was widened by the candidacy of , Joseph V. for Mayor on the Recovery party ticket in 1933 . Although Mr. Flynn agreed reluctantly to Mr. 's candidacy on an independent ticket , which was started under Federal administration auspices , Tammany blamed him for splitting the Democratic party in the city and the election of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia , and tried to establish an antiFlynn organization in the Bronx , but with no success . , Mr. Flynn in the meantime had been established as the political representative of the Roosevelt administration in this city . In 1933 President Roosevelt appointed Mr. Flynn regional administrator of the N. R. A. public works g proram for New York , New Jersey and p anPennsylvania , and later named him ' United States Commissioner General to the World 's Fair . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for renomination and re-election in 1936 , having become Democratic National Committeeman for New York . Successor to Farley At the 1940 Democratic National Convention Mr. Flynn was one of the inner group of Roosevelt supporters , headed by Harry L. Hopkins , who brought about the " draft " movement to renominate the President for a third term . Still a friend of Mr. Farley , he unsuccessfully ' tried to induce the then Postmaster General to withdraw his own candidacy and to continue as National Chairman . After Mr. Fancy 's repeated refusals to continue Mr. Flynn was President Roosevelt 's personal choice for the National Chairmanship . In 1945 , Mr. Flynn , and Mr. Kelly were at first opposed to the nomination of . William O'Dwyer for Mayor of New Ybrk but finally assented to the latter 's nomination . He broke with the American Labor party because of his belief that it was dominated by Communists and would not permit Bronx Democratic candidat ( to accept Labor party endorsements . When Mr. Farley , after the defeat of Tames M. Mead for Governor , called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the former National Chairman and Postmaster General was " politically dead . " Mr. Farley , he added , never won a party victory " without the magic name of Roosevelt . " Mr. Flynn was an early and constant supporter of President Truman . When , the President announced he would seek election to his first full four-year term , Mr. Flynn endorsed him and predicted he would carry New York State and be victorious in the campaign . Mr. Flynn predicted in 1948 that Mayor O'Dwyer ' would be reelected and then helped spearhead the successful movement to draft him when the city 's chief executive suddenly announced he would not run . Mr. Flynn also helped to sponsor a movement to draft former Governor Lehman for United States Senator , In the last three years , as he became less robust in health , Mr. Flynn slackened his political activity somewhat but continued to wield a strong influence in party laffairs . He wanted Mr. Truman to seek re-election in 1952 , and had said in late 1951 that the President could beat anybody , including General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman ? eliminated himself as a candidate , Mr. Flynn supported Averell Harriman , Director for Mutual Security under Mr. Truman , for the Presidential nomination . When Mr. Harriman dropped out of the running , Mr. Flynn accepted Adlai E. Stevenson enthusiastically , In the widening split of the Democratic party in recent years , Mr. Flynn stood as a pillar of the New Deal-Fair Deal wing of Democracy . Won State Chairmanship Fight When , after the party 's defeat , in this state in the Presidential , and Senate polls , Mr. Fitzpatrick resigned as state chairman , a struggle for his successor shaped up between the conservative wing , headed by Mr. Farley , and the liberal wing , led by Mr. Flynn . The state committee met last Decemb'er and elected Mr. Flynn 's choice , Mr. Balch , over the Farley candidate , William H. Morgan . The struggle between the New Deal-Fair Deal and Conservative wings of the party went into another inning in the selection last month of designees for the Mayoralty nomination . The Parley wing . represented locally by the Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impellitteri for renomination . Mr. Flynn and Mr. peSapio , refusing to go along , picked Borough President Wagner . A six-footer and well built , with ruddy complexion and graying hair , Mr. Flynn had an attractive personality . His hobbies were golf , horseback ? riding , etching and literary studies . In a quiet way , he helped a number of young men through college . He encouraged political activity of women . On June 15 , 1927 , Mr. Flynn =Dried Miss Helen Margaret Jones , daughter of Ur . and Mrs. William Jones of the Bronx and a graduate of St. Jerome 's Convent .
