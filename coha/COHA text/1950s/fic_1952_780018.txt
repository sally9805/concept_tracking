 | " But I seen you ? Say , buddy , " he said , looking swiftly back up the street , " what you trying to do ? " " Do ? What do you mean ? " " I mean talking ' bout you did n't lose nothing . You working a con game or something ? " He backed away , looking hurriedly at the pedestrians back up the street from where he 'd come . " What on earth are you talking about now ? " I said . " I tell you I did n't lose anything . " " Man , do n't tell me ! I seen you . What the hell you mean ? " he said , furtively removing the package from his pocket . " This here feels like money or a gun or something and I know damn well I seen you drop it . " " Oh , that , " I said . " That is n't anything  --  I thought you ? " " That 's right , Oh . ' So you remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing you a favor and you play me for a fool . You some kind of confidence man or dope peddler or something ? You trying to work one of those pigeon drops on me ? " " Pigeon drop ? " I said . " You 're making a mistake ? " " Mistake , hell ! Take this damn stuff , " he said , thrusting the package in my hands as though it were a bomb with a lighted fuse . " I got a family , man . I try to do you a favor and here you trying to get me into trouble ? You running from a detective or somebody ? " " Wait a minute , " I said . " You 're letting your imagination run away ; this is nothing but garbage ? " " Do n't try to hand me that simple-minded crap , " he wheezed . " I know what kind of garbage it is . You young New York Negroes is a blip ! I swear you is ! I hope they catch you and put your ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had smallpox . I looked at the package . He thinks it 's a gun or stolen goods , I thought , watching him go . A few steps farther along I was about to toss it boldly into the street when upon looking back I saw him , joined by another man now , gesturing toward me indignantly . I hurried away . Give him time and the fool 'll call a policeman . I dropped the package back into the brief case . I 'd wait until I got downtown . On the subway people around me were reading their morning papers , pressing forward their unpleasant faces . I rode with my eyes shut , trying to make my mind blank to thoughts of Mary . Then turning , I saw the item Violent Protest Over Harlem Eviction , just as the man lowered his paper and moved out of the breaking doors .  | I could hardly wait until I reached 42nd Street , where I found the story carried on the front page of a tabloid , and I read it eagerly . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had disappeared in the excitement , but that it referred to me was unmistakable . It had lasted for two hours , the crowd refusing to vacate the premises . I entered the clothing store with a new sense of self-importance . I selected a more expensive suit than I 'd intended , and while it was being altered I picked up a hat , shirts , shoes , underwear and socks , then hurried to call Brother Jack , who snapped his orders like a general . I was to go to a number on the upper East Side where I 'd find a room , and I was to read over some of the Brotherhood 's literature which had been left there for me , with the idea of my making a speech at a Harlem rally to be held that evening . The address was that of an undistinguished building in a mixed Spanish-Irish neighborhood , and there were boys throwing snowballs across the street when I rang the super 's bell . The door was opened by a small pleasant-faced woman who smiled . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment is all ready for you . He said you 'd come about this time and I 've just this minute come down . My , just look at that snow . " I followed her up the three flights of stairs , wondering what on earth I 'd do with a whole apartment . " This is it , " she said , removing a chain of keys from her pocket and opening a door at the front of the hall . I went into a small comfortably furnished room that was bright with the winter sun . " This is the living room , " she said proudly , " and over here is your bedroom . " It was much larger than I needed , with a chest of drawers , two upholstered chairs , two closets , a bookshelf and a desk on which was stacked the literature to which he 'd referred . A bathroom lay off the bedroom , and there was a small kitchen . " I hope you like it , Brother , " she said , as she left . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The apartment was clean and neat and I liked it  --  especially the bathroom with its tub and shower . And as quickly as I could I drew a bath and soaked myself . Then feeling clean and exhilarated I went out to puzzle over the Brotherhood books and pamphlets . My brief case with the broken image lay on the table . I would get rid of the package later ; right now I had to think about tonight 's rally .  | CHAPTER 16 AT SEVEN-THIRTY Brother Jack and some of the others picked me up and we shot up to Harlem in a taxi . As before , no one spoke a word . There was only the sound made by a man in the corner who drew noisily on a pipeful of rum-flavored tobacco , causing it to glow on and off , a red disk in the dark . I rode with mounting nervousness ; the taxi seemed unnaturally warm . We got out in a side street and went down a narrow alley in the dark to the rear of the huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , here we are , " Brother Jack said , leading the way through a dark rear door to a dressing room lighted by naked , low-hanging bulbs  --  a small room with wooden benches and a row of steel lockers with a network of names scratched on the doors . It had a footballlocker smell of ancient sweat , iodine , blood and rubbing alcohol , and I felt a welling up of memories . " We remain here until the building fills , " Brother Jack said . " Then we make our appearance  --  just at the height of their impatience . " He gave me a grin . " Meanwhile , you think about what you 'll say . Did you look over the material ? " " All day , " I said . " Good . I suggest , however , that you listen carefully to the rest of us . We 'll all precede you so that you can get the pointers for your remarks . You 'll be last . " I nodded , seeing him take two of the other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone , the others were studying their notes , talking . I went across the room to a torn photograph tacked to the faded wall . It was a shot , in fighting stance , of a former prizefight champion , a popular fighter who had lost his sight in the ring . It  | must have been right here in this arena , I thought . That had been years ago . The photograph was that of a man so dark and battered that he might have been of any nationality . Big and loose-muscled , he looked like a good man . I remembered my father 's story of how he had been beaten blind in a crooked fight , of the scandal that had been suppressed , and how the fighter had died in a home for the blind . Who would have thought I 'd ever come here ? How things were twisted around ! I felt strangely sad and went and slouched on a bench . The others talked on , their voices low . I watched them with a sudden resentment . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience to death before I came on ! I 'd probably be shouted down before I could get started . . . But perhaps not , I thought , jabbing my suspicions away . Perhaps I could make an effect through the sheer contrast between my approach and theirs . Maybe that was the strategy . . . Anyway , I had to trust them . I had to . Still a nervousness clung to me . I felt out of place . From beyond the door I could hear a distant scrape of chairs , a murmur of voices . Little worries whirled up within me : That I might forget my new name ; that I might be recognized from the audience . I bent forward , suddenly conscious of my legs in new blue trousers . But how do you know they 're your legs ? What 's your name ? I thought , making a sad joke with myself . It was absurd , but it relieved my nervousness . For it was as though I were looking at my own legs for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cad me to safety or danger . I stared at the dusty floor . Then it was as though I were returning after a long suspension of consciousness , as though I stood simultaneously at opposite ends of a tunnel . I secnud to view myself from the distance of the campus while yet sitting there on a bench in the old arena ; dressed in a new blue suit ; sitting across the room from a group of intense men who talked among themselves in hushed , edgy voices ; while yet in the distance I could hear the clatter of chairs , more voices , a cough . I seemed aware of it all from a point deep within me , yet there was a disturbing vagueness about what I saw , a disturbing unformed quality , as when you see yourself in a photo exposed during adolescence : the expression empty , the grin without character , the ears too large , the pimples , " courage bumps , " too many and too well-defined . This was a new phase , I realized , a new beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself that looked on with remote eyes and keep it always at the distance of the campus , the hospital machine , the battle royal  --  all now far  | behind . Perhaps the part of me that observed listlessly but saw all , missing nothing , was still the malicious , arguing part ; the dissenting voice , my grandfather part ; the cynical , disbelieving part  --  the traitor self that always threatened internal discord . Whatever it was , I knew that I 'd have to keep it pressed down . I had to . For if I were successful tonight , I 'd be on the road to something big . No more flying apart at the seams , no more remembering forgotten pains . . . No , I thought , shifting my body , they 're the same legs on which I 've come so far from home . And yet they were somehow new . The new suit imparted a newness to me . It was the clothes and the new name and the circumstances . It was a newness too subtle to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming someone else . I sensed vaguely and with a flash of panic that the moment I walked out upon the platform and opened my mouth I 'd be someone else . Not just a nobody with a manufactured name which might have belonged to anyone , or to no one . But another personality . Few people knew me now , but after tonight ... How was it ? Perhaps simply to be known , to be looked upon by so many people , to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes , perhaps this was enough to make one different ; enough to transform one into something else , someone else ; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy one became one day a man ; a man with a deep voice  --  although my voice had been deep since I was twelve . But what if someone from the campus wandered into the audience ? Or someone from Mary 's  --  even Mary herself ? " No , it would n't change it , " I heard myself say softly , " that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under orders . Even if I met Mary on the street , I 'd have to pass her by unrecognized . A depressing thought  --  and I got up abruptly and went out of the dressing room and into the alley . Without my overcoat it was cold . A feeble light burned above the entrance , sparkling the snow . I crossed the alley to the dark side , stopping near a fence that smelled of carbolic acid , which , as I looked back across the alley , caused me to remember a great abandoned hole that had been the site of a sports arena that had burned before my birth . All that was left , a cliff drop of some forty feet below the heat-buckled walk , was the shell of concrete with weirdly bent and rusted rods that had been its basement . The hole was used for dumping , and after a rain it stank with stagnant water . And now in my mind I stood upon the walk looking out across the hole past a Hooverville shanty of packing cases and bent tin signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark depthless water lay without motion in the hole , and past the Hooverville a switch engine idled upon the shining rails , and as a plume of white steam curled slowly from its funnel I saw a man come out of the shanty and start up the path which led to the walk above . Stooped and dark and sprouting rags from his shoes , hat and sleeves , he shuffled slowly toward me , bringing a threatening cloud of carbolic acid . It was a syphilitic who lived alone in the shanty between the hole and the railroad yard , coming up to the street only to beg money for food and disinfectant with which to soak his rags . Then in my mind I saw him stretching out a hand from which the fingers had been eaten away and I ran  --  back to the dark , and the cold and the present . I shivered , looking toward the street , where up the alley through the tunneling dark , three mounted policemen loomed beneath the circular , snow-sparkling beam of the street lamp , grasping their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animals bent close , as though plotting ; the leather of saddles and leggings shining . Three white men and three black horses . Then a car passed and they showed in full relief , their shadows flying like dreams across the sparkle of snow and darkness . And , as I turned to leave , one of the horses violently tossed its head and I saw the gauntleted fist yanked down . Then there was a wild neigh and the horse plunged off in the dark , the crisp , frantic clanking of metal and the stomping of hooves followed me to the door . Perhaps this was something for Brother Jack to know . But inside they were still in a huddle , and I went back and sat on the bench . I watched them , feeling very young and inexperienced and yet strangely old , with an oldness that watched and waited quietly within me . Outside , the audience had begun to drone ; a distant , churning sound that brought back some of the terror of the eviction . My mind flowed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking in upon a huge black-and-white dog , log-chained to an apple tree . It was Master , the bulldog ; and I was the child who was afraid to touch him , although , panting with heat , he seemed to grin back at me like a fat good-natured man , the saliva roping silvery from his jowls . And as the voices of the crowd churned and mounted and became an impatient splatter of hand claps , I thought of Master 's low hoarse growl . He had barked the same note when angry or when being brought his dinner , when lazily snapping flies ,  | or when tearing an intruder to shreds . I liked , but did n't trust old Master ; I wanted to please , but did not trust the crowd . Then I looked at Brother Jack and grinned : That was it ; in some ways , he was like a toy bull terrier . But now the roar and clapping of hands became a song and I saw Brother Jack break off and bounce to the door . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our signal . " We went in a bunch , out of the dressing room and down a dim passage aroar with the distant sound . Then it was brighter and I could see a spotlight blazing the smoky haze . We moved silently , Brother Jack following two very black Negroes and two white men who led the procession , and now the roar of the crowd seemed to rise above us , flaring louder . I noticed the others falling into columns of four , and I was alone in the rear , like the pivot of a drill team . Ahead , a slanting shaft of brightness marked the entrance to one of the levels of the arena , and now as we passed it the crowd let out a roar . Then swiftly we were in the dark again , and climbing , the roar seeming to sink below us and we were moved into a bright blue light and down a ramp ; to each side of which , stretching away in a curve , I could see rows of blurred faces  --  then suddenly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " It always happens the first time , " he shouted , stopping to let me get my balance , his voice small in the roar . " It 's the spotlight ! " It had picked us up now , and , beaming just ahead , led us into the arena and encircled us full in its beam , the crowd thundering . The song burst forth like a rocket to the marching tempo of clapping hands : John Brown 's body lies a-mold'ring in the grave John Brown 's body lies a-mold'ring in the grave John Brown 's body lies a-mold'ring in the grave ? His soul is marching on ! Imagine that , I thought , they make the old song sound new . At first I was as remote as though I stood in the highest balcony looking on . Then I walked flush into the vibrations of the voices and felt an electric tingling along my spine . We marched toward a flagdraped platform set near the front of the arena , moving through an  | aisle left between rows of people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women who stood when we came on . With a nod Brother Jack indicated our chairs and we faced the applause standing . Below and above us was the audience , row after row of faces , the arena a bowl-shaped aggregation of humanity . Then I saw the policemen and was disturbed . What if they recognized me ? They were all along the wall . I touched the arm of the man ahead , seeing him turn , his mouth halting in a verse of the song . " Why all the police ? " I said , leaning forward on the back of his chair . " Cops ? Do n't worry . Tonight they 're ordered to protect us . This meeting is of great political consequences ! " he said , turning away . Who ordered them to protect us ? I thought ? But now the song was ending and the building rang with applause , yells , until the chant burst from the rear and spread : No more dispossessing of the dispossessed ! No more dispossessing of the dispossessed ! The audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchronized . I looked at Brother Jack . He stood up front beside a microphone , his feet planted solidly on the dirty canvascovered platform , looking from side to side ; his posture dignified and benign , like a bemused father listening to the performance of his adoring children . I saw his hand go up in a salute , and the audience thundered . And I seemed to move in close , like the lens of a camera , focusing into the scene and feeling the heat and excitement and the pounding of voice and applause against my diaphragm , my eyes flying from face to face , swiftly , fleetingly , searching for someone I could recognize , for someone from the old life , and seeing the faces become vaguer and vaguer the farther they receded from the platform . The speeches began . First an invocation by a Negro preacher ; then a woman spoke of what was happening to the children . Then came speeches an various aspects of the economic and political situation . I listened carefully , trying to snatch a phrase here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , precise terms . It was becoming a highkeyed evening . Songs flared between speeches , chants exploded as spontaneously as shouts at a southern revival . And I was somehow  | attuned to it all , could feel it physically . Sitting with my feet on the soiled canvas I felt as though I had wandered into the percussion section of a symphony orchestra . It worked on me so thoroughly that I soon gave up trying to memorize phrases and simply allowed the excitement to carry me along . Someone pulled on my coat sleeve  --  my turn had come . I went toward the microphone where Brother Jack himself waited , entering the spot of light that surrounded me like a seamless cage of stainless steel . I halted . The light was so strong that I could no longer see the audience , the bowl of human faces . It was as though a semi-transparent curtain had dropped between us , but through which they could see me  --  for they were applauding  --  without themselves being seen . I felt the hard , mechanical isolation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood , barely hearing Brother Jack 's introduction . Then he was through and there was an encouraging burst of applause . And I thought , They remember ; some of them were there . The microphone was strange and unnerving . I approached it incorrectly , my voice sounding raspy and full of air , and after a few words I halted , embarrassed . I was getting off to a bad start , something had to be done . I leaned toward the vague audience closest to the platform and said , " Sorry , folks . Up to now they 've kept me so far away from these shiny electric gadgets I have n't learned the technique . . . And to tell you the truth , it looks to me like it might bite ! Just look at it , it looks like the steel skull of a man ! Do you think he died of dispossession ? " It worked and while they laughed someone came and made an adjustment . " Do n't stand too close , " he advised . " How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and vibrant over the arena . " Is that better ? " There was a ripple of applause . " You see , all I needed was a chance . You 've granted it , now it 's up to me ! " The applause grew stronger and from down front a man 's farcarrying voice called out , " We with you , Brother . You pitch ' em we catch ' em ! " That was all I needed , I 'd made a contact , and it was as though his voice was that of them all . I was wound up , nervous . I might have been anyone , might have been trying to speak in a foreign language . For I could n't remember the correct words and phrases from the pamphlets . I had to fall back upon tradition and since it  | was a political meeting , I selected one of the political techniques that I 'd heard so often at home : The old down-to-earth , **53;845;TOOLONG approach . I could n't see them so I addressed the microphone and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those who think we who are gathered here are dumb , " I shouted . " Tell me if I 'm right . " " That 's a strike , Brother , " the voice called . " You pitched a strike . " " Yes , they think we 're dumb . They call us the common people . ' But I 've been sitting here listening and looking and trying to understand what 's so common about us . I think they 're guilty of a gross mis-statement of fact  --  we are the uncommon people ? " " Another strike , " the voice called in the thunder , and I paused holding up my hand to halt the noise . " Yes , we 're the uncommon people  --  and I 'll tell you why . They call us dumb and they treat us dumb . And what do they do with dumb ones ? Think about it , look around ! They 've got a slogan and a policy , they 've got what Brother Jack would call a theory and a practice . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It 's dispossess him ! Evict him ! Use his empty head for a spittoon and his back for a door mat ! It 's break him ! Deprive him of his wages ! Its use his protest as a sounding brass to frighten him into silence , it 's beat his ideas and his hopes and homely aspirations into a tinkling cymbal ! A small , cracked cymbal to tinkle on the Fourth of July ! Only muffle it ! Do n't let it sound too loud ! Beat it in stoptime , give the dumb bunnies the soft-shoe dance ! The Big Wormy Apple , The Chicago Get Away , the Shoo Fly Do n't Bother Me ! " And do you know what makes us so uncommon ? " I whispered hoarsely . We let them do it ! " The silence was profound . The smoke boiled in the spotlight . " Another strike , " ' I heard the voice call sadly . " Ai n't no use to protest the decision ! " And I thought , Is he with me or against me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went on . " They 've tried to dispossess us of our manhood and womanhood ! Of our childhood and adolescence ? You heard the sister 's statistics on our infant mortality rate . Do n't you know you 're lucky to be uncommonly born ? Why , they even tried to dispossess us of our dislike of being dispossessed ! And I 'll tell you something else  --  if we do n't resist , pretty soon they 'll succeed ! These are the days of dispossession , the season of homelessness , the time of evictions . We 'll be dispossessed  | of the very brains in our heads ! And we 're so un-common that we ca n't even see it ! Perhaps we 're too polite . Perhaps we do n't care to look at unpleasantness . They think we 're blind  --  un-commonly blind . And I do n't wonder . Think about it , they 've dispossessed us each of one eye from the day we 're born . So now we can only see in straight white lines . We 're a nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your life ? Such an un-common sight ! " " An ' ai n't a farmer 's wife in the house , " the voice called through the titters of bitter laughter . " It 's another strike ! " I leaned forward . " You know , if we are n't careful , they 'll slip up on our blind sides and  --  plop ! out goes our last good eye and we 're blind as bats ! Someone 's afraid we 'll see something . Maybe that 's why so many of our fine friends are present tonight  --  blue steel pistols and blue serge suits and all ! ? but I believe one eye is enough to lose without resistance and I think that 's your belief . So let 's get together . Did you ever notice , my dumb one-eyed brothers , how two totally blind men can get together and help one another along ? They stumble , they bump into things , but they avoid dangers too ; they get along . Let 's get together , uncommon people . With both our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll see who makes us so uncommon ! Up to now we 've been like a couple of one-eyed men walking down opposite sides of the street . Someone starts throwing bricks and we start blaming each other and fighting among ourselves . But we 're mistaken ! Because there 's a third party present . There 's a smooth , oily scoundrel running down the middle of the wide gray street throwing stones ? He 's the one ! He 's doing the damage ! He claims he needs the space  --  he calls it his freedom . And he knows he 's got us on our blind side and he 's been popping away till he 's got us silly  --  uncommonly silly ! In fact , his freedom has got us damn-nigh blind ! Hush now , do n't call no names ! " I called , holding up my palm . " I say to hell with this guy ! I say come on , cross over ! Let 's make an alliance ! I 'll look out for you , and you look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a damn good pitching arm ! " " You do n't pitch no balls , Brother ! Not a single one ! " " Let 's make a miracle , " I shouted . " Let 's take back our pillaged eyes ! Let 's reclaim our sight ; let 's combine and spread our vision . Peep around the corner , there 's a storm coming . Look down the avenue , there 's only one enemy . Ca n't you see his face ? " It was a natural pause and there was applause , but as it burst I  | realized that the flow of words had stopped . What would I do when they started to listen again ? I leaned forward , straining to see through the barrier of light . They were mine , out there , and I could n't afford to lose them . Yet I suddenly felt naked , sensing that the words were returning and that something was about to be said that I should n't reveal . " Look at me ! " The words ripped from my solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times are hard , I 've known despair . I 'm from the South , and since coming here I 've known eviction . I 'd come to distrust the world . . . But look at me now , something strange is happening . I 'm here before you . I must confess ... " And suddenly Brother Jack was beside me , pretending to adjust the microphone . " Careful now , " he whispered . " Do n't end your usefulness before you 've begun . " " I 'm all right , " I said , leaning toward the mike . " May I confess ? " I shouted . " You are my friends . We share a common disinheritance , and it 's said that confession is good for the soul . Have I your permission ? " " You batting .500 , Brother , " the voice called . There was a stir behind me . I waited until it was quiet and hurried on . " Silence is consent , " I said , " so I 'll have it out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chin thrust forward and my eyes focused straight into the light . " Something strange and miraculous and transforming is taking place in me right now . . . as I stand here before you ! " I could feel the words forming themselves , slowly falling into place . The light seemed to boil opalescently , like liquid soap shaken gently in a bottle . " Let me describe it . It is something odd . It 's some t h n n t that I ' m sure I 'd never experience anywhere else in the- world . I feel your eyes upon me . I hear the pulse of your breathing . And now , at this moment , with your black and white eyes upon me , I feel . . . I feel . . . I stumbled in a stillness so complete that I could hear the gears of the huge clock mounted somewhere on the balcony gnawing upon time . " What is it , son , what do you feel ?

With your eyes upon me I feel that I 've found my true family ! My true people ! My true country ! I am 4 a new citizen of the country of your vision , a native of your fraternal land .

I made an indefinite movement . What should I do  --  wave to them ? I faced the shouts , cheers , shrill whistling , my eyes burning from the light . I felt a large tear roll down my face and I wiped it away with embarrassment . Others were starting down . Why did n't someone help me get out of the spot before I spoiled everything ? But with the tears came an increase of applause and I lifted my head , surprised , my eyes streaming . The sound seemed to roar up in waves . They had begun to stomp the floor and I was laughing and bowing my head now unashamed . It grew in volume , the sound of splitting wood came from the rear . I grew tired , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started back toward the chairs . Red spots danced before my eyes . Someone took my hand , was puzzled by the hot mixture of hate and admiration bursting through his words as I thanked him and removed my hand from his crushing grasp . " Thanks , " I said , " but the others had raised them to the right pitch . " I shuddered ; he sounded as though he would like to throttle me . I could n't see and there was much confusion and suddenly someone spun me around , pulling me off balance , and I felt myself pressed against warm feminine softness , holding on . " Oh , Brother , Brother ! " a woman 's voice cried into my ear , " Lit-  | tle Brother ! " and I felt the hot moist pressure of her lips upon my cheek . Blurred figures bumped about me . I stumbled as in a game of blindman 's buff . My hands were shaken , my back pounded . My face was sprayed with the saliva of enthusiasm , and I decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wise to wear dark glasses . It was a deafening demonstration . We left them cheering , knocking over chairs , stomping the floor . Brother Jack guided me off the platform . " It 's time we left , " he shouted . " Things have truly begun to move . All that energy must be organized ! " He guided me through the shouting crowd , hands continuing to touch me as I stumbled along . Then we entered the dark passage and when we reached the end the spots faded from my eyes and I began to see again . Brother Jack paused at the door . " Listen to them , " he said . " Just waiting to be told what to do ! " And I could still hear the applause booming behind us . Then several of the others broke off their conversation and faced us , as the applause muffled down behind the closing door . " Well , what do you think ? " Brother Jack said enthusiastically . " How 's that for a starter ? " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white , feeling swift panic . They were grim . " Well ? " Brother Jack said , his voice suddenly hard . I could hear the creaking of someone 's shoes . " Well ? " he repeated . Then the man with the pipe spoke up , a swift charge of tension building with his words . " It was a most unsatisfactory beginning , " he said quietly , punctuating the " unsatisfactory " with a stab of his pipe . He was looking straight at me and I was puzzled . I looked at the others . Their faces were noncommittal , stolid . " Unsatisfactory ! " Brother Jack exploded . " And what alleged process of thought led to that brilliant pronouncement ? " " This is no time for cheap sarcasm , Brother , " the brother with the pipe said . " Sarcasm ? You made the sarcasm . No , it is n't a time for sarcasms nor for imbecilities . Nor for plain damn-fooleries ! This is a key moment in the struggle , things have just begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are afraid of success ? What 's wrong ? Is n't this just what we 've been working for ? " " Again , ask yourself . You are the great leader . Look into your crystal ball . " Brother Jack swore . " Brothers ! " someone said . Brother Jack swore and swung to another brother . " You , " he said to the husky man . " Have you the courage to tell me what 's going on here ? Have we become a street-corner gang ? " Silence . Someone shuffled his feet . The man with the pipe was looking now at me . " Did I do something wrong ? " I said . " The worst you could have done , " he said coldly . Stunned , I looked at him wordlessly . " Never mind , " Brother Jack said , suddenly calm . " Just what is the problem , Brother ? Let 's have it out right here . Just what is your complaint ? " " Not a complaint , an opinion . If we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pipe said . " Your opinion , then , " Brother Jack said . " In my opinion the speech was wild , hysterical , politically irresponsible and dangerous , " he snapped . " And worse than that , it was incorrect ! " He pronounced " incorrect " as though the term described the most heinous crime imaginable , and I stared at him openmouthed , feeling a vague guilt . " S0000 , " Brother Jack said , looking from face to face , " there 's been a caucus and decisions have been made . Did you take minutes , Brother Chairman ? Have you recorded your wise disputations ? " " There was no caucus and the opinion still holds , " the brother with the pipe said . " No meeting , but just the same there has been a caucus and decisions have been reached even before the event is finished . " " But , Brother , " someone tried to intervene . " A most brilliant operation , " Brother Jack went on , smiling now . " A consummate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But come down , Brothers , come down or you 'll land on your dialectics ; the stage of history has n't built that far . The month after next , perhaps , but not yet . And what do you think , Brother Wrestrum ? " he asked , pointing to a big fellow of the shape and size of Supercargo .  | " I think the brother 's speech was backward and reactionary ! " he said . I wanted to answer but could not . No wonder his voice had sounded so mixed when he congratulated me . I could only stare into the broad face with its hate-burning eyes . " And you , " Brother Jack said . " I liked the speech , " the man said , " I thought it was quite effective . " " And you ? " Brother Jack said to the next man . " I am of the opinion that it was a mistake . " " And just why ? " " Because we must strive to reach the people through their intelligence . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was the antithesis of the scientific approach . Ours is a reasonable point of view . We are champions of a scientific approach to society , and such a speech as we 've identified ourselves with tonight destroys everything that has been said before . The audience is n't thinking , it 's yelling its head off . " " Sure , it 's acting like a mob , " the big black brother said . Brother Jack laughed . " And this mob , " he said , " Is it a mob against us , or is it a mob for us  --  how do our muscle-bound scientists answer that ? " But before they could answer he continued , " Perhaps you 're right , perhaps it is a mob ; but if it is , then it seems to be a mob that 's simply boiling over to come along with us . And I should n't have to tell you theoreticians that science bases its judgments upon experiment ! You 're jumping to conclusions before the experiment has run its course . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in the experiment . The initial step , the release of energy . I can understand that it should make you timid  --  you 're afraid of carrying through to the next step  --  because it 's up to you to- organize that energy . Well , it 's going to be organized and not by a bunch of timid sideline theoreticians arguing in a vacuum , but by getting out and leading the people ! " He was fighting mad , looking from face to face , his red head bristling , but no one answered his challenge . " It 's disgusting , " he said , pointing to me . " Our new brother has succeeded by instinct where for two years your science ' has failed , and now all you can offer is destructive criticism . " " I beg to differ , " the brother with the pipe said . " To point out the  | dangerous nature of his speech is n't destructive criticism . Far from it . Like the rest of us , the new brother must learn to speak scientifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last tt occurs to you , " Brother Jack said , pulling down the corners of his mouth . " Training . All is not lost . There 's hope that our wild but effective speaker may be tamed . The scientists perceive a possibility ! Very well , it has been arranged ; perhaps not scientifically but arranged nevertheless . For the next few months our new brother is to undergo a period of intense study and indoctrination under the guidance of Brother Hambro . That 's right , " he said , as I started to speak . " I meant to tell you later . " " But that 's a long time , " I said . " How am I going to live ? " " Your salary will continue , " he said . " Meanwhile , you 'll be guilty of no further unscientific speeches to upset our brothers ' scientific tranquillity . In fact , you are to stay completely out of Harlem . Perhaps then we 'll see if you brothers are as swift at organizing as you are at criticizing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Brother Jack is correct , " a short , bald man said . " And I do n't think that we , of all people , should be afraid of the people 's enthusiasm . What we 've got to do is to guide it into channels where it will do the most good . " The rest were silent , the brother with the pipe looking at me unbendingly . " Come , " Brother Jack said . " Let 's get out of here . If we keep our eyes on the real goal our chances are better than ever before . And let 's remember that science is n't a game of chess , although chess may be played scientifically . The other thing to remember is that if we are to organize the masses we must first organize ourselves . Thanks to our new brother , things have changed ; we must n't fail to make use of our opportunity . From now on it 's up to you . " " We shall see , " the brother with the pipe said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Hambro would n't harm anyone . " Hambro , I thought , going out , who the hell is he ? I suppose I 'm lucky they did n't fire me . So now I 've got to go to school again . Out in the night the group was breaking up and Brother Jack drew me aside . " Do n't worry , " he said . " You 'll find Brother Hambro interesting , and a period of training was inevitable . Your speech tonight was a test which you passed with flying colors , so now you 'll be prepared for some real work . Here 's the address ; see Brother  | Hambro the first thing in the morning . He 's already been notified . " When I reached home , tiredness seemed to explode within mc . My nerves remained tense even after I had had a hot shower and crawled into bed . In my disappointment , I wanted only to sleep , but my mind kept wandering back to the rally . It had actually happened . I had been lucky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had liked me . Or perhaps I had said the wrong things in the right places  --  whatever , they had liked it regardless of the brothers , and from now on my life would be different . It was different already . For now I realized that I meant everything that I had said to the audience , even though I had n't known that I was going to say those things . I had intended only to make a good appearance , to say enough to keep the Brotherhood interested in me . What had come out was completely uncalculated , as though another self within me had taken over and held forth . And lucky that it had , or I might have been fired . Even my technique had been different ; no one who had known me at college would have recognized the speech . But that was as it should have been , for I was someone new  --  even though I had spoken in a very old-fashioned way . I had been transformed , and now , lying restlessly in bed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred audience whose faces I had never clearly seen . They had been with me from the first word . They had wanted me to succeed , and fortunately I had spoken for them and they had recognized my words . I belonged to them . I sat up , grasping my knees in the dark as the thought struck home . Perhaps this was what was meant by being " dedicated and set aside . " Very well , if so , I accepted it . My possibilities were suddenly broadened . As a Brotherhood spokesman I would represent not only my own group but one that was much larger . The audience was mixed , their claims broader than race . I would do whatever was necessary to serve them we I.If they could take a chance with me , then I 'd do the very best that I could . How else could I save myself from disintegration ? I sat there in the dark trying to recall the sequence of th speech . Already it seemed the expression of someone else . Yet I k w that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recorded by a stenographer , I would have a look at it tomorrow . Words , phrases , skipped through my mind ; I saw the blue haze again . What had I meant by saying that I had become " more human " ? Was it a phrase that I had picked up from some preceding  | speaker , or a slip of the tongue ? For a moment I thought of my grandfather and quickly dismissed him . What had an old slave to do with humanity ? Perhaps it was something that Woodridge had said in the literature class back at college . I could see him vividly , half-drunk on words and full of contempt and exaltation , pacing before the blackboard chalked with quotations from Joyce and Yeats and Sean O'Casey ; thin , nervous , neat , pacing as though he walked a high wire of meaning upon which no one of us would ever dare venture . I could hear him : " Stephen 's problem , like ours , was not actually one of creating the uncreated conscience of his race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our task is that of making ourselves individuals . The conscience of a race is the gift of its individuals who see , evaluate , record . . . We create the race by creating ourselves and then to our great astonishment we will have created something far more important : We will have created a culture . Why waste time creating a conscience for something that does n't exist ? For , you see , blood and skin do not think ! " But no , it was n't Woodridge . " More human " . . . Did I mean that I had become less of what I was , less a Negro , or that I was less a being apart ; less an exile from down home , the South ? .. . But all this is negative . To become less  --  in order to become more ? Perhaps that was it , but in what way more human ? Even Woodridge had n't spoken of such things . It was a mystery once more , as at the eviction I had uttered words that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they had done . By kicking me into the dark they 'd made me see the possibility of achieving something greater and more important than I 'd ever dreamed . Here was a way that did n't lead through the back door , a way not limited by black and white , but a way which , if one lived long enough and worked hard enough , could lead to the highest possible rewards . Here was a way to have a part in making the big decisions , of seeing through the mystery of how the country , the world , really operated . For the first time , lying there in the dark , I could glimpse the possibility of being more than a member of a race . It was no dream , the possibility existed . I had only to work and learn and survive in order to go to the top . Sure I 'd study with Hambro , I 'd learn what he had to teach and a lot more . Let tomorrow come . The sooner I was through with this Hambro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | CHAPTER /7 FOUR MONTHS later when Brother Jack called the apartment at midnight to tell me to be prepared to take a ride I became quite excited . Fortunately , I was awake and dressed , and when he drove up a few minutes later I was waiting expectantly at the curb . Maybe , I thought , as I saw him hunched behind the wheel in his top coat , this is what I 've been waiting for . " How have you been , Brother ? " I said , getting in . " A little tired , " he said . " Not enough sleep , too many problems . " Then , as he got the car under way , he became silent , and I decided not to ask any questions . That was one thing I had learned thoroughly . There must be something doing at the Chthonian , I thought , watching him staring at the road as though lost in thought . Maybe the brothers are waiting to put me through my paces . If so , fine ; I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Chthonian I looked out to discover that he had brought me to Harlem and was parking the car . " We 'll have a drink , " he said , getting out and heading for where the neon-lighted sign of a bull 's , head announced the , El Toro Bar . I was disappointed . I wanted nO ink ; I wanted to take the next step that lay between me and an assignment . I followed him inside with a surge of irritation . The barroom was warm and quiet . The usual rows of bottles with exotic names were lined on the shelves , and in the rear , where four men argued in Spanish over glasses of beer , a juke box , lit up green and red , played " Media Luz . " And as we waited for the bartender , I tried to figure the purpose of the trip . I had seen very little of Brother Jack after beginning my studies  | with Brother Hambro . My life had been too tightly organized . But I should have known that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know . Instead , I was to meet him in the morning as usual . That Hambro , I thought , is he a fanatic teacher ! A tall , friendly man , a lawyer and the Brotherhood 's chief theoretician , he had proved to be a hard taskmaster . Between daily discussions with him and a rigid schedule of reading , I had been working harder than I 'd ever found necessary at college . Even my nights were organized ; every evening found me at some rally or meeting in one of the many districts ( though this was my first trip to Harlem since my speech ) where I 'd sit on the platform with the speakers , making notes to be discussed with him the next day . Every occasion became a study situation , even the parties that sometimes followed the meetings . During these I had to make mental notes on the ideological attitudes revealed in the guests ' conversations . But I had soon learned the method in it : Not only had I been learning the many aspects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the city-wide membership had grown familiar with me . My part in the eviction was kept very much alive , and although I was under orders to make no speeches , I had grown accustomed to being introduced as a kind of hero . Yet it had been mainly a time for listening and , being a talker , I had grown impatient . Now I knew most of the Brotherhood arguments so well  --  those I doubted as well as those I believed  --  that I could repeat them in my sleep , but nothing had been said about my assignment . Thus I had hoped the midnight call meant some kind of action was to begin .. . Beside me , Brother Jack was still lost in thought . He seemed in no hurry to go elsewhere or to talk , and as the slow-motion bartender mixed our drinks I puzzled vainly as to why he had brought me here . Before me , in the panel where a mirror is usually placed , I could see a scene from a bullfight , the bull charging close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sculptured folds so close to his body that man and bull seemed to blend in one swirl of calm , pure motion . Pure grace , I thought , looking above the bar to where , larger than life , the pink and white image of a girl smiled down from a summery beer ad on which a calendar said April One . Then , as our drinks were placed before us , Brother Jack came alive , his mood changing as though in the instant he had settled whatever had been bothering him and felt suddenly free .  | " Here , come back , " he said , nudging me playfully . " She 's only a cardboard image of a cold steel civilization . " I laughed , glad to hear him joking . " And that ? " I said , pointing to the bullfight scene . " Sheer barbarism , " he said , watching the bartender and lowering his voice to a whisper . " But tell me , how have you found your work with Brother Hambro ? " " Oh , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if I 'd had teachers like him in college , I 'd know a few things . He 's taught me a lot , but whether enough to satisfy the brothers who disliked my arena speech , I do n't know . Shall we converse scientifically ? " He laughed , one of his eyes glowing brighter than the other . " Do n't worry about the brothers , " he said . " You 'll do very well . Brother Hambro 's reports on you have been excellent . " " Now , that 's nice to hear , " I said , aware now of another bullfight scene further down the bar in which the matador was being swept skyward on the black bull 's horns . " I 've worked pretty hard trying to master the ideology . " " Master it , " Brother Jack said , " but do n't overdo it . Do n't let it master you . There is nothing to put the people to sleep like dry ideology . The ideal is to strike a medium between ideology and inspiration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in such a way that they 'll do what we wish . " He laughed . " Remember too , that theory always comes after practice . Act first , theorize later ; that 's also a formula , a devastatingly effective one ! " He looked as me as though he did not see me and I could not tell whether he was laughing at me or with me . I was sure only that he was laughing . " Yes , " I said , " I 'll try to master all that is required . " " You can , " he said . " And now you do n't have to worry about the brothers ' criticism . Just throw some ideology back at them and they 'll leave you alone  --  provided , of course , ltlsaat you have the right backing and produce the required results . Another drink ? " " Thanks , I 've had enough . " " Are you sure ? " " Sure . " " Good . Now to your assignment : Tomorrow you are to become chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . The committee decided yesterday . "  | " But I had no idea . " " You 'll do all right . Now listen . You are to continue what you started at the eviction . Keep them stirred up . Get them active . Get as many to join as possible . You 'll be given guidance by some of the older members , but for the time being you are to see what you can do . You will have freedom of action  --  and you will be under strict discipline to the committee . " " I see , " I said . " No , you do n't quite see , " he said , " but you will . You must not underestimate the discipline , Brother . It makes you answerable to the entire organization for what you do . Do n't underestimate the discipline . It is very strict , but within its framework you are to have full freedom to do your work . And your work is very important . Understand ? " His eyes seemed to crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go now so that you can get some sleep , " he said , draining his glass . " You 're a soldier now , your health belongs to the organization . " " I 'll be ready , " I said . " I know you will . Until tomorrow then . You 'll meet with the executive committee of the Harlem section at nine A.M. You know the location of course ? " " No , Brother , I do n't . " " Oh ? That 's right  --  then you 'd better come up with me for a minute . I have to see someone there and you can take a look at where you 'll work . I 'll drop you off on the way down , " he said . THE district offices were located in a converted church structure , the main floor of which was occupied by a pawn shop , its window crammed with loot that gleamed dully in the darkened street . We took a stair to the third floor , entering a large room beneath a high Gothic ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , making for the end of the large room where I saw a row of smaller ones , only one of which was lighted . And now I saw a man appear in the door and limp forward . " Evening , Brother Jack , " he said . " Why , Brother Tarp , I expected to find Brother Tobitt . " " I know . He was here but he had to leave , " the man said . " He left this envelope for you and said he 'd call you later on tonight . " " Good , good , " Brother Jack said . " Here , meet a new brother ... "  | " Pleased to meet you , " the brother said , smiling . " I heard you speak at the arena . You really told ' em . " " Thanks , " I said . " So you liked it , did you , Brother Tarp ? " Brother Jack said . " The boy 's all right with me , " the man said . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your new spokesman . " " That 's fine , " the man said . " Looks like we 're going to get some changes made . " " Correct , " Brother Jack said . " Now let 's take a look at his office and we 'll be going . " " Sure , Brother , " Tarp said , limping before me into one of the dark rooms and snapping on a light . " This here is the one . " I looked into a small office , containing a flat-top desk with a telephone , a typewriter on its table , a bookcase with shelves of books and pamphlets , and a huge map of the world inscribed with ancient nautical signs and a heroic figure of Columbus to one side . " If there 's anything you need , just see Brother Tarp , " Brother Jack said . " He 's here at all times . " " Thanks , I shall , " I said . " I 'll get oriented in the morning . " " Yes , and we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Brother Tarp . See that everything is ready for him in the morning . " " He wo n't have to worry about a thing , Brother . Good night . " " It 's because we attract men like Brother Tarp there that we shall triumph , " he said as we climbed into the car . " He 's old physically , but ideologically he 's a vigorous young man . He can be depended upon in the most precarious circumstance . " " He sounds like a good man to have around , " I said . " You 'll see , " he said and lasped into a silence that lasted until we reached my door . THE committee was assembled in the tall- with the high Gothic ceiling when I arrived , sitting in folding chairs around two small tables pushed together to form a unit . " Well , " Brother Jack said , " you are on time . Very good , we favor precision in our leaders . " " Brother , I shall always try to be on time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sisters , " he said , " your new spokesman . Now to begin . Are we all present ? " " All except Brother Tod Clifton , " someone said .  | His red head jerked with surprise . " So ? " " He 'll be here , " a young brother said . " We were working until three this morning . " " Still , he should be on time ? Very well , " Brother Jack said , taking out a watch , " let us begin . I have only a little time here , but a little time is all that is needed . You all know the events of the recent period , and the role our new brother has played in them . Briefly , you are here to see that it is n't wasted . We must achieve two things : We must plan methods of increasing the effectiveness of our agitation , and we must organize the energy that has already been released . This calls for a rapid increase of membership . The people are fully aroused ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become passive , or they will become cynical . Thus it is necessary that we strike immediately and strike hard ! " For this purpose , " he said , nodding toward me , " our brother has been appointed district spokesman . You are to give him your loyal support and regard him as the new instrument of the committee 's authority . . . I heard the slight applause splatter up  --  only to halt with the opening of the door , and I looked down past the rows of chairs to where a hatless young man about my own age was coming into the hall . He wore a heavy sweater and slacks , and as the others looked up I heard the quick intake of a woman 's pleasurable sigh . Then the young man was moving with an easy Negro stride out of the shadow into the light , and I saw that he was very black and very handsome , and as he advanced mid-distance into the room , that he possessed the chiseled , black-marble features sometimes found on statues in northern museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of house children and the black offspring of yard children bear names , features and character traits as identical as the rifling of bullets fired from a common barrel . And now close up , leaning tall and relaxed , his arms outstretched stiffly upon the table , I saw the broad , taut span of his knuckles upon the dark grain of the wood , the muscular , sweatered arms , the curving line of the chest rising to the easy pulsing of his throat , to the square , smooth chin , and saw a small X-shaped patch of adhesive upon the subtly blended , velvet-over-stone , granite-over-bone , Afro-Anglo-Saxon contour of his cheek . He leaned there , looking at us all with a remote aloofness in which I sensed an unstated questioning beneath a friendly charm . Sens-  | ing a possible rival , I watched him warily , wondering who he was . " Ah so , Brother Tod Clifton is late , " Brother Jack said . " Our leader of the youth is late . Why is this ? " The young man pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the doctor , " he said . " What is this ? " Brother Jack said , looking at the cross of adhesive on the black skin . " Just a little encounter with the nationalists . With Ras the Exhorter 's boys , " Brother Clifton said . And I heard a gasp from one of the women who gazed at him with shining , compassionate eyes . Brother Jack gave me a quick look . " Brother , you have heard of Ras ? He is the wild man who calls himself a black nationalist . " " I do n't recall so , " I said . " You 'll hear of him soon enough . Sit down , Brother Clifton ; sit down . You must be careful . You are valuable to the organization , you must not take chances . " " This was unavoidable , " the young man said . " Just the same , " Brother Jack said , returning to the discussion with a call for ideas . " Brother , are we still to fight against evictions ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks to you . " " Then why not step up the fight ? " He studied my face . " What do you suggest ? " " Well , since it has attracted so much attention , why not try to reach the whole community with the issue ? " " And how would you suggest we go about it ? " " I suggest we get the community leaders on record in support of us . " " There are certain difficulties in face of this , " Brother Jack said . " Most of the leaders are against us . " " But I think he 's got something there , " Brother Clifton said . " What if we got them to support the issue whether they like us or not ? The issue is a community ' , it 's non-partisan . " " Sure , " I said , " that 's how it looks to me . With all the excitement over evictions they ca n't afford to come out against us , not without appearing to be against the best interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them across a barrel , " Clifton said . " That is perceptive enough , " Brother Jack said . The others agreed . " You see , " Brother Jack said with a grin , " we 've always avoided  | these leaders , but the moment we start to advance on a broad front , sectarianism becomes a burden to be cast off . Any other suggestions ? " He looked around . " Brother , " I said , remembering now , " when I first came to Harlem one of the first things that impressed me was a man making a speech from a ladder . He spoke very violently and with an accent , but he had an enthusiastic audience . . . Why ca n't we carry our program to the street in the same way ? " " So you have met him , " he said , suddenly grinning . " Well , Ras the Exhorter has had a monopoly in Harlem . But now that we are larger we might give it a try . What the committee wants is results ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll have trouble with the Extortor  --  I mean the Exhorter , " a big woman said . " His hoodlums would attack and denounce the white meat of a roasted chicken . " We laughed . " He goes wild when he sees black people and white people together , " she said to me . " We 'll take care of that , " Brother Clifton said , touching his cheek . " Very well , but no violence , " Brother Jack said . " The Brotherhood is against violence and terror and provocation of any kind  --  aggressive , that is . Understand , Brother Clifton ? " " I understand , " he said . " We will not countenance any aggressive violence . Understand ? Nor attacks upon officials or others who do not attack us . We are against all forms of violence , do you understand ? " " Yes , Brother , " I said . " Very well , having made this clear I leave you now , " he said . " See what you can accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the guidance you need . Meanwhile , remember that we are all under discipline . " He left and we divided the labor . I suggested that each work in the area he knew best . Since there was no liaison between the Brotherhood and the community leaders I assigned myself the task of creating one . It was decided that our street meetings begin immediately and that Brother Tod Clifton was to return and go over the details with me . While the discussion continued I studied their faces . They seemed absorbed with the cause and in complete agreement , blacks and whites . But when I tried to place them as to type I got nowhere . The  | big woman who looked like a southern " sudsbuster " was in charge of women 's work , and spoke in abstract , ideological terms . The shylooking man with the liver splotches on his neck spoke with a bold directness and eagerness for action . And this Brother Tod Clifton , the youth leader , looked somehow like a hipster , a zoot suiter , a sharpie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool had never known a straightener . I could place none e. them . They seemed familiar but were just as different as Brother Jack and the other whites were from all the white men I had known . They were all transformed , like familiar people seen in a dream . Well , I thought , I 'm different too , and they 'll see it when the talk is finished and the action begins . I 'll just have to be careful not to antagonize anyone . As it is , someone might resent my being placed in charge . But when Brother Tod Clifton came into my office to discuss the street meeting . I saw no signs of resentment , but a complete absorption in the strategy of the meeting . With great care he went about instructing me how to deal with hecklers , on what to do if we were attacked , and upon how to recognize our own members from the rest of the crowd . For all his seeming zoot-suiter characteristics his speech was precise and I had no doubt that he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " I said when he had finished . " It 'll go big , man , " he said . " It 'll be bigger than anything since Garvey . " " I wish I could be so sure , " I said . " I never saw Garvey . " " I did n't either , " he said , " but I understand that in Harlem he was very big . " " Well , we 're not Garvey , and he did n't last . " " No , but he must have had something , " he said with sudden pits sion . " He must have had something to move all those people ! Our people are hell to move . He must have had plenty ! " I looked at him . His eyes were turned inward ; then he smiled . " Do n't worry , " he said . " We have a scientific plan and you set them off . Things are so bad they 'll listen , and when they listen they 'll go along . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have n't been around the movement as I have , for three years now , and I can feel the change . They 're ready to move . " " I hope your feelings are right , " I said . " They 're right , all right , " he said . " All we have to do is gather them in. "  | THE evening was almost of a winter coldness , the corner well lighted and the all-Negro crowd large and tightly packed . Up on the ladder now I was surrounded by a group of Clifton 's youth division , and I could see , beyond their backs with upturned collars , the faces of the doubtful , the curious and the convinced in the crowd . It was early and I threw my voice hard down against the traffic sounds , feeling the damp coldness of the air upon my cheeks and hands as my voice warmed with my emotion . I had just begun to feel the pulsing set up between myself and the people , hearing them answering in staccato applause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And over the heads of the crowd and down past the dark storefronts and blinking neon signs I saw a bristling band of about twenty men quick-stepping forward . I looked down . " It 's trouble , keep talking , " Clifton said . " Give the boys the signal . " " My Brothers , the time has come for action , " I shouted . And now I saw the youth members and some older men move around to the back of the crowd , and up to meet the advancing group . Then something sailed up out of the dark and landed hard against my forehead , and I felt the crowd surge in close , sending the ladder moving backwards , and I was like a man tottering above a crowd on stilts , then dropping backwards into the street and clear , hearing the ladder clatter down . They were milling in a panic now , and I saw Clifton beside me . " It 's Ras the Exhorter , " he yelled . " Can you use your hands ? " " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , all right then . Here 's your chance . Come on , let 's see you duke ! " He moved forward and seemed to dive into the whirling crowd , and I beside him , seeing them scatter into doorways and pound off in the dark . " There 's Ras , over there , " Clifton cried . And I heard the sound of breaking glass and the street went dark . Someone had knocked out the light , and through the dimness I saw Clifton heading to where a red neon sign glowed in a dark window as something went past my head . Then a man ran up with a length of pipe and I saw Clifton close with him , ducking down and working in close and grabbing the man 's wrist and twisting suddenly like a soldier executing an about-face so that now he faced me , the back of the man 's elbow rigid across his shoulder and the man rising on tiptoe and screaming  | as Clifton straightened smoothly and levered down on the arm . I heard a dry popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang upon the walk ; then someone caught me hard in the stomach and suddenly I knew that I was fighting too . I went to my knees and rolled and pulled erect , facing him . " Get up , Uncle Tom , " he said , and I clipped him . He had his hands and I had mine and the match was even but he was not so lucky . He was n't down and he was n't out , but I caught him two good ones and he decided to fight elsewhere . When he turned I tripped him and moved away . The fight was moving back into the dark where the street lights had been knocked out clear to the corner , and it was quiet except for the grunting and straining and the sound of footfalls and of blows . It was confusing in the dark and I could n't tell ours from theirs and moved cautiously , trying to see . Someone up the street in the dark yelled , " Break it up ! Break it up ! " and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neon sign glowed mysteriously and there was a lot of running and cursing , and now I saw him working skillfully in a store lobby before a red CHECKS CASHED HERE sign and I hurried over , hearing objects sailing past my head and the crash of glass . Clifton 's arms were moving in short , accurate jabs against the head and stomach of Ras the Exhorter , punching swiftly and scientifically , careful not to knock him into the window or strike the glass with his fists , working Ras between rights and lefts jabbed so fast that he rocked like a drunken bull , from side to side . And as I came up Ras tried to bull his way out and I saw Clifton drive him back and down into a squat , his hands upon the dark floor of the lobby , his heels back against the door like a runner against starting blocks . And now , shooting forward , he caught Clifton coming in , butting him , and I heard the burst of breath and Clifton was on his back and something flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , heavy figure as wide as the lobby now with the knife , moving deliberately . I spun , looking for the length of pipe , diving for it and crawling on hands and knees and here , here  --  and coming up to see Ras reach down , getting one hand into Clifton 's collar , the knife in the other , looking down at Clifton and panting , bull-angry . I froze , seeing him draw back the knife and stop it in mid-air ; draw back and stop , cursing ; then draw back and stop again , all very quickly , beginning to cry now and talking rapidly at the same time ; and me easing slowly forward . " Mahn , " Ras blurted , " I ought to kill you . Godahm , I ought to  | kill you and the world be better off . But you black , mahn . Why you be black , mahn ? I swear I ought to kill you . No mahn strike the Exhorter , godahmit , no mahn ! " I saw him raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed Clifton into the street and stood over him , sobbing . " Why you with these white folks ? Why ? I been watching you a long time . I say to myself , ' Soon he get smart and get tired . He get out of that t'ing . ' Why a good boy like you still with them ? " Still moving forward , I saw his face gleam with red angry tears as he stood above Clifton with the still innocent knife and the tears red in the glow of the window sign . " You my brother , mahn . Brothers are the same color ; how the hell you call these white men brother ? Shit , mahn . That 's shit ! Brothers the same color . We sons of Mama Africa , you done forgot ? You black , BLACK ! You  --  Godahm , mahn ! " he said , swinging the knife for emphasis . " You got band hair ! You got thick lips ! They say you stink ! They hate you , mahn . You African . AFRICAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahn . They sell you out . That shit is old-fashioned . They enslave us  --  you forget that ? How can they mean a black mahn any good ? How they going to be your brother ? " I had reached him now and brought the pipe down hard , seeing t the knife fly off into the dark as he grabbed his wrist , and I raised the pipe again , suddenly hot with fear and hate , as he looked at me out of his narrow little eyes , standing his ground . " And you , mahn , " the Exhorter said , " a reg'lar little black devil ! A godahm sly mongoose ! Where you think you from , going with the white folks ? I know , godahm ; do n't I know it ! You from down South ! You from Trinidad ! You from Barbados ! Jamaica , South Africa , and the white mahn 's foot in your ass all the way to the hip . What you trying to deny by betraying the black people ? Why you fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with plenty education ; I been hearing your rabble rousing . Why you go over to the enslaver ? What kind of education is that ? What kind of black mahn is that who betray his own mama ? " " Shut up , " Clifton said , leaping to his feet . " Shut up ! " " Hell , no , " Ras cried , wiping his eyes with his fists . " I talk ! Bust me with the pipe but , by God , you listen to the Exhorter ! Come in with us , mahn . We build a glorious movement of black people . Black People ! What they do , give you money ? Who wahnt the dahm stuff ? Their money bleed black blood , mahn . It 's unclean ! Taking  | their money is shit , mahn . Money without dignity ? That 's band shit ! " Clifton lunged toward him . I held him , shaking my head . " Come on , the man 's crazy , " I said , pulling on his arm . Ras struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mahn ? You call me crazy ? Look at you two and look at me  --  is this sanity ? Standing here in three shades of blackness ! Three black men fighting in the street because of the white enslaver ? Is that sanity ? Is that consciousness , scientific understahnding ? Is that the modern black mahn of the twentieth century ? Hell , mahn ! Is it self-respect  --  black against black ? What they give you to betray  --  their women ? You fall for that ? " " Let 's go , " I said , listening and remembering and suddenly alive in the dark with the horror of the battle royal , but Clifton looked at Ras with a tight , fascinated expression , pulling away from me . " Let 's go , " I repeated . He stood there , looking . " Sure , you go , " Ras said , " but not him . You contahminated but he the real black mahn . In Africa this mahn be a chief , a black king ! Here they say he rape them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet this mahn ca n't beat them off with baseball bat  --  shit ! What kind of foolishness is it ? Kick him ass from cradle to grave then call him brother ? Does it make mahthematics ? Is it logic ? Look at him , mahn ; open your eyes , " he said to me . " I look like that I rock the blahsted world ! They know about me in Japan , India  --  all the colored countries . Youth ! Intelligence ! The mahn 's a natural prince ! Where is your eyes ? Where your self-respect ? Working for them dahm people ? Their days is numbered , the time is almost here and you fooling ' round like this was the nineteenth century . I do n't understahnd you . Am I ignorant ? Answer me , mahn ! " " Yes , " Clifton burst out . " Hell , yes ! " " You t'ink I 'm crazy , is it c'ase I speak band English ? Hell , it ai n't my mama tongue , mahn , I 'm African ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes ! " " You believe that ? " said Ras . " What they do to you , black mahn ? Give you them stinking women ? " Clifton lunged again , and again I grabbed him ; and again Ras held his ground , his head glowing red . " Women ? Godahm , mahn ! Is that equality ? Is that the black mahn 's freedom ? A pat on the back and a piece of cunt without no passion ? Maggots ! They buy you that blahsted cheap , mahn ? What  | they do to my people ! Where is your brains ? These women dregs , mahn ! They bilge water ! You know the high-class white mahn hates the black mahn , that 's simple . So now he use the dregs and wahnt you black young men to do his dirty work . They betray you and you betray the black people . They tricking you , mahn . Let them fight among themselves . Let ' em kill off one another . We organize ? organization is good  --  but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hitch ! He take one them strumpets and tell the black mahn his freedom lie between her skinny legs  --  while that son of a gun , he take all the power and the capital and do n't leave the black mahn not'ing . The good white women he tell the black mahn is a rapist and keep them locked up and ignorant while he makes the black mahn a race of bahstards . " When the black mahn going to tire of this childish perfidity ? He got you so you do n't trust your black intelligence ? You young , do n't play you'self cheap , mahn . Do n't deny you'self ! It took a billion gallons of black blood to make you . Recognize you'self inside and you wan the kings among men ! A mahn knows he 's a mahn when he got not'ing , when he 's naked  --  nobody have to tell him that . You six foot tall , mahn . You young and intelligent . You black and beautiful  --  do n't let ' em tell you different ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead ! I 'd have killed you , mahn . Ras the Exhorter raised up his knife and tried to do it , but he could not do it . Why do n't you do it ? I ask myself . I will do it now , I say ; but somet'ing tell me , ' No , no ! You might be killing your black king ! ' And I say , yas , yas ! So I accept your humiliating ahction . Ras recognized your black possibilities , mahn . Ras would not sahcrifice his black brother to the white enslaver . Instead he cry . Ras is a mahn  --  no white mahn have to tell him that  --  and Ras cry . So why do n't you recognize your black duty , mahn , and come jine us ? " His chest was heaving and a note of pleading had come into the harsh voice . He was an exhorter , all right , and I was caught in the crude , insane eloquence of his plea . He stood there , awaiting an answer . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I looked up to see the firing of its engine , and we were all three silent , watching . Suddenly the Exhorter shook his fist toward the plane and yelled , " Hell with him , some day we have them too ! Hell with him ! " He stood there , shaking his fist as the plane rattled the buildings in its powerful flight . Then it was gone and I looked about the un-  | real street . They were fighting far up the block in the dark now and we were alone . I looked at the Exhorter . I did n't know if I were angry or amazed . " Look , " I said , shaking my head , " let 's talk sense . From now on we 'll be on the street corners every night and we 'll be prepared for trouble . We do n't want it , especially with you , but we wo n't run either ... " " Godahm , mahn , " he said , leaping forward , " this is Harlem . This is my territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let white folks come in and spread their poison ? Let ' em come in like they come and take over the numbers racket ? Like they have all the stores ? Talk sense , mahn , if you talking to Ras , talk sense ! " " This is sense , " I said , " and you listen as we listened to you . We 'll be out here every night , understand . We 'll be out here and the next time you go after one of our brothers with a knife  --  and I mean white or black  --  well , we wo n't forget it . " He shook his head , " Nor will I forget you either , mahn . " " Do n't . I do n't want you to ; because if you forget there 'll be trouble . You 're mistaken , do n't you see you 're outnumbered ? You need allies to win . . . " " That there is sense . Black allies . Yellow and brown allies ! " " All men who want a brotherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid , mahn . They white , they do n't have to be allies with no black people . They get what they wahnt , they turn against you . Where 's your black intelligence ? " " Thinking like that will get you lost in the backwash of history , " I said . " Start thinking with your mind and not your emotions . " He shook his head vehemently , looking at Clifton . " This black mahn talking to me about brains and thinking . I ask both of you , are you awake or sleeping ? What is your pahst and where are you going ? Never mind , take your corrupt ideology and eat out your own guts like a laughing hyena . You are nowhere , mahn . Nowhere ! Ras is not ignorant , nor is Ras afraid . No ! Ras , he be here black and fighting for the liberty of the black people when the white folks have got what they wahnt and done gone off laughing in your face and you stinking and choked up with white maggots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew pink in the red glow . " That 'll be all right with me , " I said . " Only remember what I said . Come on , Brother Clifton . This man 's full of pus , black pus . "  | We started away , a piece of glass crunching under my foot . " Maybe so , " Ras said , " but I ahm no fool ! I ahm no black educated fool who t'inks everything between black mahn and white mahn can be settled with some blahsted lies in some bloody books written by the white mahn in the first place . It 's three hundred years of black blood to build this white mahn 's civilization and wah n't be wiped out in a minute . Blood calls for blood ! You remember that . And remember that I am not like you . Ras recognizes the true issues and he is not afraid to be black . Nor is he a traitor for white men . Remember that : I am no black traitor to the black people for the white people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark and there was a crack and I saw Ras go down and Clifton breathing hard and Ras lying there in the street , a thick , black man with red tears on his face that caught the reflection of the CHECKS CASHED HERE sign . And again , as Clifton looked gravely down he seemed to ask a silent question . " Let 's go , " I said . " Let 's go ! " We started away as the screams of sirens sounded , Clifton cursing quietly to himself . Then we were out of the dark onto a busy street and he turned to me . There were tears in his eyes . " That poor , misguided son of a bitch , " he said . " He thinks a lot of you too , " I said . I was glad to be out of the dark and away from that exhorting voice . " The man 's crazy , " Clifton said . " It 'll run you crazy if you let it . " " Where 'd he get that name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess he did . Ras is a title of respect in the East . It 's a wonder he did n't say something about Ethiopia stretching forth her wings , ' " he said , mimicking Ras . " He makes it sound like the hood of a cobra fluttering . . . I do n't know . . . I do n't know ... " " We 'll have to watch him now , " I said . " Yes , we 'd better , " he said . " He wo n't stop fighting . . . And thanks for getting rid of his knife . " " You did n't have to worry , " I said . " He would n't kill his king . " He turned and looked at me as though he thought I might mean it ; then he smiled . " For a while there I thought I was gone , " he said .  | As we headed for the district office I wondered what Brother Jack would say about the fight . " We 'll have to overpower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do that , all right . But it 's on the inside that Ras is strong , " Clifton said . " On the inside he 's dangerous . " " He wo n't get on the inside , " I said . " He 'd consider himself a traitor . " " No , " Clifton said , " he wo n't get on the inside . Did you hear how he was talking ? Did you hear what he was saying ? " " I heard him , sure , " I said . " I do n't know , " he said . " I suppose sometimes a man has to plunge outside history . . . " " What ? " " Plunge outside , turn his back . . . Otherwise he might kill somebody , go nuts . " I did n't answer . Maybe he 's right , I thought , and was suddenly very glad I had found Brotherhood . T H E next morning it rained and I reached the district before the others arrived and stood looking through the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , and on beyond the monotonous pattern of its bricks and mortar I saw a row of trees rising tall and graceful in the rain . One tree grew close by and I could see the rain streaking its bark and its sticky buds . Trees were rowed the length of the long block beyond me , rising tall in dripping wetness above a series of cluttered backyards . And it occurred to me that cleared of its ramshackle fences and planted with flowers and grass , it might form a pleasant park . And just then a paper bag sailed from a window to my left and burst like a silent grenade , scattering garbage into the trees and pancaking to earth with a soggy , exhausted plop ! I started with disgust , then thought , The sun will shine in those backyards some day . A community clean-up campaign might be worthwhile for a slack season , at that . Everything could n't possibly be as exciting as last night . Turning back to my desk I sat facing the map now as Brother Tarp appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job , " he said . " Good morning . I have so much to do that I thought I 'd better get started early , " I said .  | " You 'll do all right , " he said . " But I did n't come in here to take up your time . I want to put something on the wall . " " Go right ahead . Can I give you a hand ? " " No , I can make it all right , " he said , clambering with his lame leg upon a chair that sat beneath the map and hanging a frame from the ceiling molding , straightening it carefully , and getting down to come over beside my desk . " Son , you know who that is ? " " Why , yes , " I said , " it 's Frederick Douglass . " " Yessir , that 's just who it is . You know much about him ? " " Not much . My grandfather used to tell me about him though . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look at him once in a while . You have everything you need  --  paper and stuff like that ? " " Yes , I have , Brother Tarp . And thanks for the portrait of Douglass . " " Do n't thank me , son , " he said from the door . " He belongs to all of us . " I sat now facing the portrait of Frederick Douglass , feeling a sudden piety , remembering and refusing to hear the echoes of my grandfather 's voice . Then I picked up the telephone and began calling the community leaders . They fell in line like prisoners : preachers , politicians , various professionals , proving Clifton correct . The eviction fight was such a dramatic issue that most of the leaders feared that their followers would have rallied to us without them . I slighted no one , no matter how unimportant ; bigshots , doctors , real-estate men and store-front preachers . And it went so fast and smoothly that it seemed not to happen to me but to someone who actually bore my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the director of Men 's House address me with profound respect . My new name was getting around . It 's very strange , I thought , but things are so unreal for them normally that they believe that to call a thing by name is to make it so . And yet I am what they think I am : . . OUR work went so well that a few Sundays later we threw a parade that clinched our hold on the community . We worked feverishly . And now the clashing and conflict of my last days at Mary 's seemed to have moved out into the struggles of the community , leaving me  | inwardly calm and controlled . Even the hustle and bustle of picketing and speechmaking seemed to stimulate me for the better ; my wildest ideas paid off . Upon hearing that one of the unemployed brothers was an ex-drill master from Wichita , Kansas , I organized a drill team of six-footers whose duty it was to march through the streets striking up sparks with their hobnailed shoes . On the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a country road . The People 's Hot Foot Squad , we called them , and when they drilled fancy formations down Seventh Avenue in the springtime dusk they set the streets ablaze . The community laughed and cheered and the police were dumfounded . But the sheer corn of it got them and the Hot Foot Squad went shuffling along . Then came the flags and banners and the cards bearing slogans ; and the squad of drum majorettes , the best-looking girls we could find , who pranced and twirled and just plain girled in the enthusiastic interest of Brotherhood . We pulled fifteen thousand Harlemites into the street behind our slogans and marched down Broadway to City Hall . Indeed , we were the talk of the town . With this success I was pushed forward at a dizzy pace . My name spread like smoke in an airless room . I was kept moving all over the place . Speeches here , there , everywhere , uptown and down . I wrote newspaper articles , led parades and relief delegations , and so on . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name prominent . Articles , telegrams and many mailings went out over my signature  --  some of which I 'd written , but most not . I was publicized , identified with the organization both by word and image in the press . On the way to work one late spring morning .1 counted fifty greetings from people I did n't know , becoming aware that there were two of me : the old self that slept a few hours a night and dreamed sometimes of my grandfather and Bledsoe and Brockway and Mary , the self that flew without wings and plunged from great heights ; and the new public self that spoke for the Brotherhood and was becoming so much more important than the other that I seemed to run a foot race against myself . Still , I liked my work during those days of certainty . I kept my eyes wide and ears alert . The Brotherhood was a world within a world and I was determined to discover all its secrets and to advance as far as I could . I saw no limits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I could reach the very top and I meant to  | get there . Even if it meant climbing a mountain of words . For now I had begun to believe , despite all the talk of science around me , that there was a magic in spoken words . Sometimes I sat watching the watery play of light upon Douglass ' portrait , thinking how magical it was that he had talked his way from slavery to a government ministry , and so swiftly . Perhaps , I thought , something of the kind is happening to me . Douglass came north to escape and find work in the shipyards ; a big fellow in a sailor 's suit who , like me , had taken another name . What had his true name been ? Whatever it was , it was as Douglass that he became himself , defined himself . And not as a boatwright as he 'd expected , but as an orator . Perhaps the sense of magic lay in the unexpected transformations . " You start Saul , and end up Paul , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youngun , you Saul , but let life whup your head a bit and you starts to trying to be Paul  --  though you still Sauls around on the side . " No , you could never tell where you were going , that was a sure thing . The only sure thing . Nor could you tell how you 'd get there ? though when you arrived it was somehow right . For had n't I started out with a speech , and had n't it been a speech that won my scholarship to college , where I had expected speechmaking to win me a place with Bledsoe and launch me finally as a national leader ? Well , I had made a speech , and it had made me a leader , only not the kind I had expected . So that was the way it was . And no complaints , I thought , looking at the map ; you started looking for red men and you found them  --  even though of a different tribe and in a bright new world . The world was strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a world that could be controlled by science , and the Brotherhood had both science and history under control . Thus for one lone stretch of time I lived with the intensity displayed by those chronic numbers players who see clues to their fortune in the most minute and insignificant phenomena : in clouds , on passing trucks and subway cars , in dreams , comic strips , the shape of dog-luck fouled on the pavements . I was dominated by the allembracing idea of Brotherhood . The organization had given the world a new shape , and me a vital role . We recognized no loose ends , everything could be controlled by our science . Life was all pattern and discipline ; and the beauty of discipline is when it works . And it was working very well .  | CHAPTER 18 ONLY MY Bledsoe-trustee inspired compulsion to read all papers that touched my hands prevented me from throwing the envelope aside . It was unstamped and appeared to be the least important item in the morning 's mail : Brother , This is advice from a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too fast . Keep working for the people but remember that you are one of us and do not forget if you get too big they will cut you down . You are from the South and you know that this is a white titan 's world . So take a friendly advice and go easy so that you can keep on helping the colored people . They do not want you to go too fast and will cut you down if you do . Be smart .. . I shot to my feet , the paper rattling poisonously in my hands . What did it mean ? Who 'd send such a thing ? " Brother Tarp ! " I called , reading again the wavery lines of a handwriting that was somehow familiar . " Brother Tarp ! " " What is it , son ? " And looking up , I received another shock . Framed there in the gray , early morning light of the door , my grandfather seemed to look from his eyes . I gave a quick gasp , then there was a silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed me unperturbed . " What 's wrong ? " he said , limping into the room . I reached for the envelope . " Where did this come from ? " I said . " What is it ? " he said , taking it calmly from my hands . " It 's unstamped . " " Oh , yes  --  I saw it myself , " he said . " I reckon somebody put it in  | the box late last night . I took it out with the regular mail . Is it something that was n't for you ? " " No , " I said , avoiding his eyes . " But  --  it is n't dated . I was wondering when it arrived ? Why are you staring at me ? " " Because looks to me like you seen a ghost . You feel sick ? " " It 's nothing , " I said . " Just a slight upset . " There was an awkward silence . He stood there and I forced myself to look at his eyes again , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Sit down a second , Brother Tarp . Since you 're here I 'd like to ask you a question . " " Sure , " he said , dropping into a chair . " Go ' head . " " Brother Tarp , you get around and know the members  --  how do they really feel about me ? " He cocked his head . " Why , sure  --  they think you 're going to make a real leader ? " " But ? " " Ai n't no buts , that 's what they think and I do n't mind telling you . " " But what about the others ? " " What others ? " " The ones who do n't think so much of me ? " " Them 's the ones I have n't heard about , son . " " But I must have some enemies , " I said . " Sure , I guess everybody has ' em , but I never heard of anybody here in the Brotherhood not liking you . As far as folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You heard any different ? " " No , but I was wondering . I 've been going along taking them so much for granted that I thought I 'd better check so that I can keep their support . " " Well , you do n't have to worry . So far , nearly everything you had anything to do with has turned out to be what the folks like , even things some of ' em resisted . Take that there , " he said , pointing to the wall near my desk . It was a symbolic poster of a group of heroic figures : An American Indian couple , representing the dispossessed past ; a blond brother ( in overalls ) and a leading Irish sister , representing the dispossessed present ; and Brother Tod Clifton and a young white couple ( it had been felt unwise simply to show Clifton and the girl ) surrounded by a group of children of mixed races , representing the future , a color photograph of bright skin texture and smooth contrast .  | " So ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Rainbow of America 's Future " " Well , when you first suggested it , some of the members was against you . " " That 's certainly true . " " Sho , and they raised the devil about the youth members going into the subways and sticking ' em up in place of them constipation ads and things  --  but do you know what they doing now ? " " I guess they 're holding it against me because some of the kids were arrested , " I said . " Holding it against you ? Hell , they going around bragging about it . But what I was about to say is they taking them rainbow pictures and tacking ' em to their walls ' long with ' God Bless Our Home ' and the Lord 's Prayer . They 're crazy about it . And same way with the Hot-Footers and all that . You do n't have to worry , son . They might resist some of your ideas , but when the deal goes down , they with you right on down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somebody on the outside who 's jealous to see you spring up all of a sudden and start to doing some of the things what should of been done years ago . And what do you care when some folks start knocking you ? It 's a sign you getting some place . " " I 'd like to believe so , Brother Tarp , " I said . " As long as I have the people with me I 'll believe in what I 'm doing . " " That 's right , " he said . " When things get rough it kind of helps to know you got support ? " His voice broke off and he seemed to stare down at me , although he faced me at eye level across the desk . " What is it , Brother Tarp ? " " You from down South , ai n't you , son ? " " Yes , " I said . He turned in his chair , sliding one hand into his pocket as he rested his chin upon the other . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into my head , son . You see , I was down there for a long time before I come up here , and when I did come up they was after me . What I mean is , I had to escape , I had to come a-running . " " I guess I did too , in a way , " I said . " You mean they were after you too ? " " Not really , Brother Tarp , I just feel that way . "  | " Well this ai n't exactly the same thing , " he said . " You notice this limp I got ? " " Yes . " " Well , I was n't always lame , and I 'm not really now ' cause the doctors ca n't find anything wrong with that leg . They say it 's sound as a piece of steel . What I mean is I got this limp from dragging a chain . " I could n't see it in his face or hear it in his speech , yet I knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook my head . " Sure , " he said . " Nobody knows that about me , they just think I got rheumatism . But it was that chain and after nineteen years I have n't been able to stop dragging my leg . " " Nineteen years ! " " Nineteen years , six months and two days . And what I did was n't much ; that is , it was n't much when I did it . But after all that time it changed into something else and it seemed to be as bad as they said it was . All that time made it bad . I paid for it with everything I had but my life . I lost my wife and my boys and my piece of land . So what started out as an argument between a couple of men turned out to be a crime worth nineteen years of my life . " " What on earth did you do , Brother Tarp ? " " I said no to a man who wanted to take something from me ; that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt ai n't fully paid and will never be paid in their terms . " A pain throbbed in my throat and I felt a kind of numb despair . Nineteen years ! And here he was talking quietly to me and this no doubt the first time he 'd tried to tell anyone about it . But why me , I thought , why pick me ? " I said no , " he said . " I said hell , no ! And I kept saying no until I broke the chain and left . " " But how ? " " They let me get close to the dogs once in a while , that 's how . I made friends with them dogs and I waited . Down there you really learn how to wait . I waited nineteen years and then one morning when the river was flooding I left . They thought I was one of them who got drowned when the levee broke , but I done broke the chain and gone . I was standing in the mud holding a long-handled shovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? And inside me I said yes ; all that water and mud and rain said yes , and I took off . " Suddenly he gave a laugh so gay it startled me.  | " I 'm tellin ' it better'n I ever thought I could , " he said , fishing in his pocket and removing something that looked like an oilskin tobacco pouch , from which he removed an object wrapped in a handkerchief . " I 've been looking for freedom ever since , son . And sometimes I 've done all right . Up to these here hard times I did very well , considering that I 'm a man whose health is not too good . But even when times were best for me I remembered . Because I did n't want to forget those nineteen years I just kind of held on to this as a keepsake and a reminder . " He was unwrapping the object now and I watched his old man 's hands . " I 'd like to pass it on to you , son . There , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to give somebody , but I think it 's got a heap of signifying wrapped up in it and it might help you remember what we 're really fighting against . I do n't think of it in terms of but two words , yes and no ; but it signifies a heap more ... " I saw him place his hand on the desk . " Brother , " he said , calling me " Brother " for the first time , " I want you to take it . I guess it 's a kind of luck piece . Anyway , it 's the one I filed to get away . " I took it in my hand , a thick dark , oily piece of filed steel that had been twisted open and forced partly back into place , on which I saw marks that might have been made by the blade of a hatchet . It was such a link as I had seen on Bledsoe 's desk , only while that one had been smooth , Tarp 's bore the marks of haste and violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it stubbornly yielded . I looked at him and shook my head as he watched me inscrutably . Finding no words to ask him more about it , I slipped the link over my knuckles and struck it sharply against the desk . Brother Tarp chuckled . " Now there 's a way I never thought of using it , " he said . " It 's pretty good . It 's pretty good . " " But why do you give it to me , Brother Tarp ? " " Because I'have to , I guess . Now do n't go trying to get me to say what I ca n't . You 're the talker , not me , " he said , getting up and limping toward the door . " It was lucky to me and I think it might be lucky to you . You just keep it with you and look at it once in a while . Course , if you get tired of it , why , give it back . " " Oh , no , " I called after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for giving it to me. "  | I looked at the dark band of metal against my fist and dropped it upon the anonymous letter . I neither wanted it nor knew what to do with it ; although there was no question of keeping it if for no other reason than that I felt that Brother Tarp 's gesture in offering it was of some deeply felt significance which I was compelled to respect . Something , perhaps , like a man passing on to his son his own father 's watch , which the son accepted not because he wanted the oldfashioned time-piece for itself , but because of the overtones of unstated seriousness and solemnity of the paternal gesture which at once joined him with his ancestors , marked a high point of his present , and promised a concreteness to his nebulous and chaotic future . And now I remembered that if I had returned home instead of coming north my father would have given me my grandfather 's oldfashioned Hamilton , with its long , burr-headed winding stem . Well , so my brother would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What were they doing now , I brooded , suddenly sick for home . I could feel the air from the window hot against my neck now as through the smell of morning coffee I heard a throaty voice singing with a mixture of laughter and solemnity : Do n't come early in the morning Neither in the heat of the day But come in the sweet cool of the Evening and wash my sins away . . . A whole series of memories started to well up , but I threw them off . There was no time for memory , for all its images were of times passed . There had been only a few minutes from the time that I 'd called in Brother Tarp about the letter and his leaving , but it seemed as though I 'd plunged down a well of years . I looked calmly now at the writing which , for a moment , had shaken my total structure of certainty , and was glad that Brother Tarp had been there to be called rather than Clifton or some of the others before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead he 'd left me soberly confident . Perhaps from the shock of seeming to see my grandfather looking through Tarp 's eyes , perhaps through the calmness of his voice alone , or perhaps through his story and his link of chain , he had restored my perspective . He 's right , I thong ' t ; whoever sent the message is trying to confuse me ; some enemy/is trying to halt our progress by destroying my  | faith through touching upon my old southern distrust , our fear of white betrayal . It was as though he had learned of my experience with Bledsoe 's letters and was trying to use that knowledge to destroy not only me but the whole Brotherhood . Yet that was impossible ; no one knew that story who knew me now . It was simply an obscene coincidence . If only I could get my hands upon his stupid throat . Here in the Brotherhood was the one place in the country where we were free and given the greatest encouragement to use our abilities , and he was trying to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying about becoming too big , it was the Brotherhood . And becoming big was exactly what the Brotherhood wanted . Had n't I just received orders to submit ideas for organizing more people ? And " a white man 's world " was just what the Brotherhood was against . We were dedicated to building a world of Brotherhood . But who had sent it  --  Ras the Exhorter ? No , it was n't like him . He was more direct and absolutely against any collaboration between blacks and whites . It was someone else , someone more insidious than Ras . But who , I wondered , forcing it below my consciousness as I turned to the tasks at hand . The morning began with people asking my advice on how to secure relief ; members coming in for instructions for small committee meetings being held in corners of the large hall ; and I had just dismissed a woman seeking to free her husband , who had been jailed for beating her , when Brother Wrestrum entered the room . I returned his greeting and watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk  --  with uneasiness . He seemed to possess some kind of authority in the Brotherhood , but his exact function was unclear . He was , I felt , something of a meddler . And hardly had he settled himself when he stared at my desk , saying , " What you got there , Brother ? " and pointed toward a pile of my papers . I leaned slowly back in my chair , looking him in the eye . " That 's my work , " I said coldly , determined to stop any interference from the start . " But I mean that , " he said , pointing , his eyes beginning to blaze , " that there . " " It 's work , " I said , " all my work . " " Is that too ? " he said , pointing to Brother Tarp 's leg link . " That 's just a personal present , Brother , " I said . " What could I do for you ? "  | " That ai n't what I asked you , Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link and held it toward him , the metal oily and strangely skinlike now with the slanting sun entering the window . " Would you care to examine it , Brother ? One of our members wore it nineteen years on the chain gang . " " Hell , no ! " He recoiled . " I mean , no , thank you . In fact , Brother , I do n't think we ought to have such things around ! " " You think so , " I said . " And just why ? " " Because I do n't think we ought to dramatize our differences . " " I 'm not dramatizing anything , it 's my personal property that happens to be lying on my desk . " " But people can see it ! " " That 's true , " I said . " But I think it 's a good reminder of what our movement is fighting against . " " No , suit ! " he said , shaking his head , " no , suh ! That 's the worse kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks think .1 of the things we have in common . That 's what makes for Brotherhood . We have to change this way we have of always talking about I1 how different we are . In the Brotherhood we are all brothers . " I was amused . He was obviously disturbed by something deeper than a need to forget differences . Fear was in his eyes . " I never thought of it in just that way , Brother , " I said , dangling the iron between my finger and thumb . " But you want to think about it , " he said . " We have to discipline ourselves . Things that do n't make for Brotherhood have to be rooted out . We have enemies , you know . I watch everything I do and say so as to be sure that I do n't upset the Brotherhood ? ' cause this is a wonderful movement , Brother , and we have to keep it that way . We have to watch ourselves , Brother . You know what I mean ? Too often we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privilege to belong to . We 're liable to say things that do n't do nothing but make for more misunderstanding . " What 's driving him , I thought , what 's all this to do with me ? Could he have sent me the note ? Dropping the iron I fished the 11 anonymous note from beneath the pile and held it by a corner , so that the slanting sun shone through the page and outlined the scrawling letters . I watched him intently . He was leaning upon the desk now , looking at the page but with no recognition in his eyes . I dropped the page upon the chain , more disappointed than relieved .  | ' Between you and me , Brother , " he said , " there are those amongst us who do n't really believe in Brotherhood . " " Oh ? " " You damn right they do n't ! They 're just in it to use it for their own ends . Some call your Brother to your face and the minute you turn your back , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch ' em . " " I have n't encountered any of that , Brother , " I said . " You will . There 's lots of poison around . Some do n't want to shake your hand and some do n't like the idea of seeing too much of you ; but goddam it , in the Brotherhood they got ta ! " I looked at him . It had never occurred to me that the Brotherhood could force anyone to shake my hand , and that he found satisfaction that it could was both shocking and distasteful . Suddenly he laughed . " Yes , dammit , they got ta ! Me , I do n't let ' em get away with nothing . If they going to be brothers let ' em be brothers ! Oh , but I 'm fair , " he said , his face suddenly self-righteous . " I 'm fair . I ask myself every day , What are you doing against Brotherhood ? ' and when I find it , I root it out , I burn it out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a brother is a full-time job . You have to be pure in heart and you have to be disciplined in body and mind . Brother , you understand what I mean ? " " Yes , I think I do , " I said . " Some folks feel that way about their religion . " " Religion ? " He blinked his eyes . " Folks like me and you is full of distrust , " he said . " We been corrupted ' til it 's hard for some of us to believe in Brotherhood . And some even want revenge ! That 's what I 'm talking about . We have to root it out ! We have to learn to trust our other brothers . After all , did n't they start the Brotherhood ? Did n't they come and stretch out their hand to us black men and say , ' We want y'all for our brothers ? ' Did n't they do it ? Did n't they , now ? Did n't they set out to organize us , and help fight our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have to remember it twentyfour hours a day . Brotherhood . That 's the word we got to keep right in front of our eyes every second . Now this brings me to why I come to see you , Brother . " He sat back , his huge hands grasping his knees . " I got a plan I want to talk over with you . " " What is it , Brother ? " I said . " Well , it 's like this . I think we ought to have some way of show-  | ing what we are . We ought to have some banners and things like that . Specially for us black brothers . " " I see , " I said , becoming interested . " But why do you think this is important ? " " ' Cause it helps the Brotherhood , that 's why . First , if you remember , when you watch our people when there 's a parade or a funeral , or a dance or anything like that , they always have some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It kind of makes the occasion seem more important like . It makes people stop look and listen . ' What 's coming off here ? ' But you know and I know that they ai n't none of ' em got no true flag  --  except maybe Ras the Exhorter , and he claims he 's Ethiopian or African . But none of us got no true flag ' cause that flag do n't really belong to us . They want a true flag , one that 's as much theirs as anybody else 's . You know what I mean ? " " Yes , I think I do , " I said , remembering that there was always that sense in me of being apart when the flag went by . It had been a reminder , until I 'd found the Brotherhood , that my star was not yet there .. . " Sure , you know , " Brother Wrestrum said . " Everybody wants a flag . We need a flag that stands for Brotherhood , and we need a sign we can wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pin or a button . " " You mean an emblem ? " " That 's it ! Something we can wear , a pin or something like that . So that when a Brother meets a Brother they can know it . That way that thing what happened to Brother Tod Clifton would n't have happened . . . " " What would n't have happened ? " He sat back . " Do n't you know about it ? " " I do n't know what you mean . " " It 's something that 's best forgot about , " he said , leaning close , his big hands gripped and stretched before him . " But you see , there was a rally and some hoodlums tried to break up the meeting , and in the fighting Brother Tod Clifton got bolt to one of the white brothers by mistake and was beating him , thought he was one of the hoodlums , he said . Things like that is bad , Brother , very bad . But with some of these emblems , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually happened , " I said .  | " Sure did . That Brother Clifton goes wild when he gits mad .. . But what do you think of my idea ? " " I think it should be brought to the attention of the committee , " I said guardedly , as the phone rang . " Excuse me a moment , Brother , " I said . It was the editor of a new picture magazine requesting an interview of " one of our most successful young men . " " That 's very flattering , " I said , " but I 'm afraid I 'm too busy for an interview . I suggest , however , that you interview our youth leader , Brother Tod Clifton ; you 'll find him a much more interesting subject . " " No , no ! " Wrestrum said , shaking his head violently as the editor said , " But we want you . You 've ? " " And you know , " I interrupted , " our work is considered very controversial , certainly by some . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've become identified with that controversy and it 's dur job to bring such subjects to the eyes of our readers . " " But so has Brother Clifton , " I said . " No , sir ; you 're the man and you owe it to our youth to allow us to tell them your story , " he said , as I watched Brother Wrestrum leaning forward . " We feel that they should be encouraged to keep fighting toward success . After all , you 're one of the latest to fight his way to the top . We need all the heroes we can get . " " But , please , " I laughed over the phone , " I 'm no hero and I 'm far from the top ; I 'm a cog in a machine . We here in the Brotherhood work as a unit , " I said , seeing Brother Wrestrum nod his head in agreement . " But you ca n't get around the fact that you 're the first of our people to attract attention to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active at least three years before me . Besides , it is n't that simple . Individuals do n't count for much ; it 's what the group wants , what the group does . Everyone here submerges his personal ambitions for the common achievement . " " Good ! That 's very good . People want to hear that . Our people need to have someone say that to them . Why do n't you let me send out an interviewer ? I 'll have her there in twenty minutes . " " You 're very insistent , but I 'm very busy , " I said . And if Brother Wrestrum had n't been wig-wagging , trying to tell p 300 me what to say I would have refused . Instead , I consented . Perhaps , I thought , a little friendly publicity would n't hurt . Such a magazine would reach many timid souls living far from the sound of our voices . I had only to remember to say little about my past . " I'm. sorry for this interruption , Brother , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll bring your idea to the attention of the committee as quickly as possible . " I stood to discourage further talk and he got up , fairly bursting to continue . " Well , I'be got to see some other brothers myself , " he said , " I 'll be seeing you soon . " " Anytime , " I said , avoiding his hand by picking up some papers . Going out , he turned with his hand on the door frame , frowning . " And , Brother , do n't forget what I said about that thing you got on your desk . Things like that do n't do nothin ' but cause confusion . They ought to be kept out of sight . " I was glad to see him go . The idea of his trying to tell me what to say in a conversation only part of which he could have heard ! And it was obvious that he disliked Clifton . Well , I disliked him . And all that foolishness and fear over the leg chain . Tarp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this big Then I forgot Brother Wrestrum until about two weeks later at our downtown headquarters , where a meeting had been called to discuss strategy . EVERYONE had arrived before me . Long benches were arranged at one side of the room , which was hot and filled with smoke . Usually such meetings sounded like a prizefight or a smoker , but now everyone was silent . The white brothers looked uncomfortable and some of the Harlem brothers belligerent . Nor did they leave me time to think about it . No sooner had I apologized for my lateness than Brother Jack struck the table with his gavel , addressing his first remarks to me . " Brother , there seems to be a serious misunderstanding among some of the brothers concerning your work and recent conduct , " he said . I stared at him blankly , my mind groping for connections . " I 'm sorry , Brother Jack , " I said , " but I do n't understand . You mean there 's something wrong with my work ? "  | " So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Certain charges have just been made . . . " " Charges ? Have I failed to carry out some directive ? " " About that there seems to be some doubt . But we 'd better let Brother Wrestrum speak of this , " he said . " Brother Wrestrum ! " I was shocked . He had n't been around since our talk , and I looked across the table into his evasive face , seeing him stand with a slouch , a rolled paper protruding from his pocket . " Yes , Brothers , " he said , " I brought charges , much as I hated to have to do it . But I been watching the way things have been going and I 've decided that if they do n't stop soon , this brother is going to make a fool out of the Brotherhood ! " There were some sounds of protest . " Yes , I said it and I mean it ! This here brother constitutes one of the greatest dangers ever confronted by our movement . " I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see traces of a smile as he scribbled something on a pad . I was becoming very hot . ++ ' ' " Be more specific , Brother , " Brother Garnett , a white brother , said . " These are serious charges and we all know that the brother 's work has been splendid . Be specific . " " Sho , I 'll be specific , " Wrestrum boomed , suddenly whipping the paper from his pocket , unrolling it and throwing it on the table . " This here 's what I mean ! " I took a step forward ; it was a portrait of me looking out from a magazine page . " Where did that come from ? " I said . " That 's it , " he boomed . " Make out like you never seen it . " " But I have n't , " I said . " I really have n't . " " Do n't lie to these white brothers . Do n't lie ! " " I 'm not lying . I never saw it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with it ? " " You know what 's wrong ! " Wrestrum said . " Look , I do n't know anything . What 's on your mind ? You have us all here , so if you have anything to say , please get it over with . " " Brothers , this man is a  --  a ? opportunist ! All you got to do is read this article to see . I charge this man with using the Brotherhood movement to advance his own selfish interests . " " Article ? " Then I remembered the interview which I had forgot-  | ten . I met the eyes of the others as they looked from me to Wrestrum . " And what does it say about us ? " Brother Jack said , pointing to the magazine . " Say ? " Wrestrum said . " It does n't say anything . It 's all about him . What he thinks , what he does ; what he 's going to do . Not a word about the rest of us who 's been building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , if you think I 'm lying . Look at it ! " Brother Jack turned to me . " Is this true ? " " I have n't read it , " I said . " I had forgotten that I was interviewed . " " But you remember it now ? " Brother Jack said . " Yes , I do now . And he happened to be in the office when the appointment was made . " They were silent . " Hell , Brother Jack , " Wrestrum said , " it 's right here in black and white . He 's trying to give people the idea that he 's the whole Brotherhood movement . " / " I 'm doing nothing of the sort . I tried to get the editor to interview Brother Tod Clifton , you know that . Since you know so little about what I 'm doing , why not tell the brothers what you 're up to . " " I 'm exposing a double-dealer , that 's what I 'm doing . I 'm exposing you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right , " I said , " expose me if you can , but stop the slander . " " I 'll expose you , all riglft , " he said , sticking out his chin . " I 'm going to . He 's doing everything I said , Brothers . And I 'll tell you something else  --  he 's trying to sew things up so that the members wo n't move unless he tells them to . Look at a few weeks ago when he was off in Philly . We tried to get a rally going and what happens ? Only about two hundred people turned out . He 's trying to train them sq they wo n't listen to no one but him . " " But , Brother , did n't we decide that the appeal had been improperly phrased ? " a brother interrupted . " Yeah , I know , but that was n't it . . . " " But the committee analyzed the appeal and ? " " I know , Brothers , and I do n't aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just seems that way ' cause you do n't know this man . He works in the dark , he 's got some kind of plot ... " " What kind of plot ? " one of the brothers said , leaning across the table . " Just a plot , " Wrestrum said . " He aims to control the movement uptown . He wants to be a dictator , ! "  | The room was silent except for the humming of fans . They looked at him with a new concern . " These are very serious charges , Brother , " two brothers said in unison . " Serious ? I know they 're serious . That 's how come I brought them . This opportunist thinks that because he 's got a little more education he 's better than anybody else . He 's what Brother Jack calls a petty ? petty individualist ! " He struck the conference table with his fist , his eyes showing small and round in his taut face . I wanted to punch that face . It no longer seemed real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably laughing , both at me and at the others . For he could n't believe what he had said . It just was n't possible . He was the plotter and from the serious looks on the committee 's faces he was getting away with it . Now several brothers started to speak at once , and Brother Jack knocked for order . " Brothers , please ! " Brother Jack said . " One at a time . What do you know about this article ? " he said to me . " Not very much , " I said . " The editor of the magazine called to say he was sending a reporter up for an interview . The reporter asked a few questions and took a few pictures with a little camera . That 's all I know . " " Did you give the reporter a prepare 'd handout ? " " I gave her nothing except a few pieces of our official literature . I told her neither what to ask me nor what to write . I naturally tried to co-operate . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement I felt it was my duty . " " Brothers , this thing was arranged , " Wrestrum said . " I tell you this opportunist had that reporter sent up there . He had her sent up and he told her what to write . " " That 's a contemptible lie , " I said . " You were present and you know I tried to get them to interview Brother Clifton ! " " Who 's a lie ? " " You 're a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel . You 're a liar and no brother of mine . " " Now he 's calling me names . Brothers , you heard him . " " Let 's not lose our tempers , " Brother Jack said calmly . " Brother Wrestrum , you 've made serious charges . Can you prove them ? " " I can prove them . All you have to do is read the magazine and prove them for yourself . "  | " It will be read . And what else ? " " All you have to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is him . Never nothing about what the rest of us do . I tell you , Brothers , this man constitutes a danger to the people of Harlem . He ought to be thrown out ! " " That is for the committee to decide , " Brother Jack said . Then to me , " And what have you to say in your defense , Brother ? " " In my defense ? " I said , " Nothing . I have n't anything to defend . I 've tried to do my work and if the brothers do n't know that , then it 's too late to tell them . I do n't know what 's behind this , but I have n't gotten around to controlling magazine writers . And I did n't realize that I was coming to stand trial either . " " This was not intended as a trial , " Brother Jack said . " If you 're ever put on trial , and I hope you 'll never be , you 'll know it . Meantime , since this is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we read and discuss the questioned interview . " I left the room and went into a vacant office , boiling with anger , , . and disgust . Wrestrum had snatched me back to the South in the midst of one of the top Brotherhood committees and I felt naked . I could have throttled him  --  forcing me to take part in a childish dispute before the others . Yet I had to fight him as I could , in terms he understood , even though we sounded like characters in a razorslinging vaudeville skit . Perhaps I should mention the anonymous note , except that someone might take it to mean that I did n't have the full support of my district . If Clifton were here , he 'd know how i to handle this clown . Were they taking him seriously just because he was black ? What was wrong with them anyway , could n't they see that they were dealing with a clown ? But I would have gone to pieces had they laughed or even smiled , I thought , for they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Yet if they had laughed , it would have been less unreal ? Where the hell am I ? " You can come in now , " a brother called to me ; and I went out to hear their decision . " Well , " Brother Jack said , " we 've all read the article , Brother , and we 're happy to report that we found it harmless enough . True , it would have been better had more wordage been given to other members of the Harlem district . But we found no evidence that you had anything to do with that . Brother Wrestrum was mistaken . " His bland manner and the knowledge that they had wasted time to see the truth released the anger within me.  | " I 'd say tnat he was criminally mistaken , " I said . " Not criminal , over-zealous , " he said . " To me it seems both criminal and over-zealous , " I said . " No , Brother , not criminal . " " But he attacked my reputation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sincere , Brother . Ile was thinking of , the good of the Brotherhood . " " But why slander me ? I do n't follow you , Brother Jack . I 'm no enemy , as he well knows . I 'm a brother too , " I said , seeing his smile . " The Brotherhood has many enemies , and we must not be too harsh with brotherly mistakes . " Then I saw the foolish , abashed expression on Wrestrum 's face and relaxed . " Very well , Brother Jack , " I said . " I suppose I should be glad you found me innocent ? " " Concerning the magazine article , " he said , stabbing the air with his finger . Something tensed in the back of my head ; I got to my feet . " Concerning the article ! You mean to say that you believe that other pipe-dream ? Is everyone reading Dick Tracy these days ? " " This is no matter of Dick Tracy , " he snapped . " The movement has many enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " What 's happened to everybody ? You act as though none of you has any contact with the at all . " Jack looked at the table . " Are you interested in our decision , Brother ? " " Oh , yes , " I said . " Yes , I am . I 'm interested in all manner of odd behavior . Who would n't be , when one wild man can make a roomful of what I 'd come to regard as some of the best minds in the country take him seriously . Certainly , I'm-interested . Otherwise I 'd act like a sensible man and run out of here ! " There were sounds of protest and Brother Jack , his face red , rapped for order . " Perhaps I should address a few words to the brother , " Brother MacAfee said . " Go ahead , " Brother Jack said thickly . " Brother , we understand how you feel , " Brother MacAfee said , " but you must understand that the movement has many enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of the organization at  | the expense of our personal feelings . The Brotherhood is bigger than all of us . None of us as individuals count when its safety is questioned . And be assured that none of us have anything but goodwill toward you personally . Your work has been splendid . This is simply a matter of the safety of the organization , and it is our responsibility to make a thorough investigation of all such charges . " I felt suddenly empty ; there was a logic in what he said which I felt compelled to accept . They were wrong , but they had the obligation to discover their mistake . Let them go ahead , they 'd find that none of the charges were true and I 'd be vindicated . What was all this obsession with enemies anyway ? I looked into their smokewashed faces ; not since the beginning had I faced such serious doubts . Up to now I had felt a wholeness about my work and direction such as I 'd never known ; not even in my mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give themselves completely ; that was its strength and my strength , and it was this sense of wholeness that guaranteed that it would change the course of history . This I had believed with all my being , but now , though still inwardly affirming that belief , I felt a blighting hurt which prevented me from trying further to defend myself . I stood there silently , waiting their decision . Someone drummed his fingers against the table top . I heard the dry-leaf rustle of onionskin papers . " Be assured that you can depend upon the fairness and wisdom of the committee , " Brother Tobitt 's voice drifted from the end of the table , but there was smoke between us and I could barely see his face . " The committee has decided , " Brother Jack began crisply , " that until all charges have been cleared , you are to have the choice of becoming inactive in Harlem , or accepting an assignment downtown . In the latter case you are to wind up your present assignment immediately . " I felt weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up my work ? " " Unless you choosei to serve the movement elsewhere . " " But ca n't you see ? " I said , looking from face to face and seeing the blank finality in their eyes . " Your assignment , should you decide to remain active , " Brother Jack said , reaching for his gavel , " is to lecture downtown on the Woman Question . " Suddenly I felt as though I had been spun like a top . " The what ! "  | " The Woman Question . My pamphlet , ' On the Woman Question in the United States , ' will be your guide . And now , Brothers , " he said , his eyes sweeping around the table , " the meeting is adjourned . " I stood there , hearing the rapping of his gavel echoing in my ears , thinking the woman question and searching their faces for signs of amusement , listening to their voices as they filed out into the halt for the slightest sound of suppressed laughter , stood there fighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outrageous joke and all the more so since their faces revealed no awareness . My mind fought desperately for acceptance . Nothing would change matters . They would shift me and investigate and I , still believing , still bending to discipline , would have to accept their decision . Now was certainly no time for inactivity ; not just when I was beginning to approach some of the aspects of the organization about which I knew nothing ( of higher committees and the leaders who never appeared , of the sympathizers and allies in groups that seemed far removed from our concerns ) , not at a time when all the secrets of power and authority still shrouded from me in mystery appeared on the way toward revelation . No , despite my anger and disgust , my ambitions were too great to surrender so easily . And why should I restrict myself , segregate myself ? I was a spokesman  --  why should n't I speak about women , or any other subject ? Nothing lay outside the scheme of our ideology , there was a policy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ahead in the movement . I left the building still feeling as though I had been violently spun but with optimism growing . Being removed from Harlem was a shock but one which would hurt them as much as me , for I had learned that the clue to what Harlem wanted was what I wanted ; and my value to the Brotherhood was no different from the value to me of my most useful contact : it depended upon my complete frankness and honesty in stating the community 's hopes and hates , fears and desires . One spoke to the committee as well as to the community . No doubt it would work much the same downtown . The new assignment was a challenge and an opportunity for testing how much of what happened in Harlem was due to my own efforts and how much to the sheer eagerness of the people themselves . And , after all , I told myself , the assignment was also proof of the committee 's goodwill . For by selecting me to speak with its authority on a subject which elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't they reaffirming their belief both in me and in the principles of Brotherhood , proving that they drew no lines even when it came to women ? They had to investigate the charges against me , but the assignment was their unsentimental affirmation that their belief in me was unbroken . I shivered in the hot street . I had n't allowed the idea to take concrete form in my mind , but for a moment I had almost allowed an old , southern backwardness which I had thought dead to wreck my career . Leaving Harlem was not without its regrets , however , and I could n't bring myself to say good-bye to anyone , not even to Brother Tarp or Clifton  --  not to mention the others upon whom I depended for information concerning the lowest groups in the community . I simply slipped my papers into my brief case and left as though going downtown for a meeting .  | CHAPTER I9 I WENT TO my first lecture with a sense of excitement . The theme was a sure-fire guarantee of audience interest and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier , I could simply stand before them with a sign across my chest , stating I KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM , and they 'd be as awed as though I were the original boogey man  --  somehow reformed and domesticated . I 'd no more have to speak than Paul Robeson had to act ; they 'd simply thrill at the sight of me . And it went well enough ; they made it a success through their own enthusiasm , and the barrage of questions afterwards left no doubts in my mind . It was only after the meeting was breaking up that there came the developments which even my volatile suspicions had n't allowed me to foresee . I was exchanging greetings with the audience when she appeared , the kind of woman who glows as though ( onsciously acting a symbolic role of life and feminine fertility . ller problem , she said , had to do with certain aspects of our ideology . " It 's rather involved , really , " she said with concern , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have a feeling that you - " " Oh , not at all , " I said , guiding her away from the others to stand near a partly uncoiled firehose hanging beside the entrance , " not at all . " " But , Brother , " she said , " it 's really so late and you must be tired . My problem could wait until some other time . . . " " I 'm not that tired , " I said . " And if there 's something bothering you , it 's my duty to do what I can to clear it up . " " But it 's quite late , " she said . " Perhaps some evening when you 're not busy you 'll drop in to see us . Then we could talk at greater length . Unless , of course ... "  | " Unless ? " " Unless , " she smiled , " I can induce you to stop by this evening . I might add that I serve a fair cup of coffee . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing open the door . Her apartment was located in one of the better sections of the city , and I must have revealed my surprise upon entering the spacious living room . " You can see , Brother " ? the glow she gave the word was disturbing ? " it is really the spiritual values of Brotherhood that interest me . Through no effort of my own , I have economic security and leisure , but what is that , really , when so much is wrong with the world ? I mean when there is no spiritual or emotional security , and no justice ? " She was slipping out of her coat now , looking earnestly into my face , and I thought , Is she a salvationist , a **27;900;TOOLONG ? ? remembering Brother Jack 's private description of wealthy members who , he said , sought political salvation by contributing financially to the Brotherhood . She was going a little fast for me and I looked at her gravely . " I can see that you 've thought deeply about this thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and it 's most perplexing ? But make yourself comfortable while I put away my things . " She was a small , delicately plump woman with raven hair in which a thin streak of white had begun almost imperceptibly to show , and when she reappeared in the rich red of a hostess gown she was so striking that I had to avert my somewhat startled eyes . " What a beautiful room you have here , " I said , looking across the rich cherry glow of furniture to see a life-sized painting of a nude , a pink Renoir . Other canvases were hung here and there , and the spacious walls seemed to flash alive with warm , pure color . What does one say to all this ? I thought , looking at an abstract fish of polished brass mounted on a piece of ebony . " I 'm glad you find it pleasant , Brother , " she said . " We like it ourselves , though I must say that Hubert finds so little time to enjoy it . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " My husband . Unfortunately he had to leave . He would have loved to 've met you , but then he 's always dashing off . Business , you know . " " I suppose it 's unavoidable , " I said with sudden discomfort .  | " Yes , it is , " she said . " But we 're going to discuss Brotherhood and ideology , are n't we ? " And there was something about her voice and her smile that gave me a sense of both comfort and excitement . It was not merely the background of wealth and gracious living , to which I was alien , hut simply the being there with her and the sensed possibility of a heightened communication ; as though the discordantly invisible and the conspicuously enigmatic were reaching a delicately balanced harmony . She 's rich but human , I thought , watching the smooth play of her relaxed hands . " There are so many aspects to the movement , " I said . " Just where shall we start ? Perhaps it 's something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's nothing that profound , " she said . " I 'm sure you 'll straighten out my little ideological twists and turns . But sit here on the sofa , Brother ; it 's more comfortable . " I sat , seeing her go toward a door , the train of her gown trailing sensuously over the oriental carpet . Then she turned and smiled . " Perhaps you 'd prefer wine or milk instead of coffee ? " " Wine , thank you , " I said , finding the idea of milk strangely repulsive . This is n't at all what I expected , I thought . She returned with a tray holding two glasses and a decanter , placing them before us on a low cocktail table , and I could hear the wine trickle musically into the glasses , one of which she placed in front of me . " Here 's to the movement , " she said , raising her glass with smiling eyes . " To the movement , " I said . " And to Brotherhood . " " And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , seeing her nearly closed eyes , her chin tilting upward , toward me , " but just what phase of our ideology should we discuss ? " " All of it , " she said . " I wish to embrace the whole of it . Life is so terribly empty and disorganized without it . I sincerely believe that only Brotherhood offers any hope of making life worth living again ? Oh , I know that it 's too vast a philosophy to grasp immediately , as it were ; still , it 's so vital and alive that one gets the feeling that one should at least make the try . Do n't you agree ? " " Well , yes , " I said . " It 's the most meaningful thing that I know . " " Oh , I 'm so pleased to have you agree with me . I suppose that 's why I always thrill to hear you speak , somehow you convey the great  | throbbing vitality of the movement . It 's really amazing . You give me such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with a mysterious smile , " I must confess that you also make me afraid . " " Afraid ? You ca n't ifiean that , " I said . " Really , " she repeated , as I laughed . " It 's so powerful , so  --  so primitive ! " I felt some of the air escape from the room , leaving it unnaturally quiet . " You do n't mean primitive ? " I said . " Yes , primitive ; no one has told you , Brother , that at times you have tom-toms beating in your voice ? " " My God , " I laughed , " I thought that was the beat of profound ideas . " " Of course , you 're correct , " she said . " I do n't mean really primitive . I suppose I mean forceful , powerful . It takes hold of one 's emotions as well as one 's intellect . Call it what you will , it has so much naked power that it goes straight through one . I tremble just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so close now that I could see a single jet-black strand of out-of-place hair . " Yes , " I said , " the emotion is there ; but it 's actually our scientific approach that releases it . As Brother Jack says , we 're nothing if not organizers . And the emotion is n't merely released , it 's guided , channelized  --  that is the real source of our effectiveness . After all , this very good wine can release emotion , but I doubt seriously that it can organize anything . " She leaned gracefully forward , her arm along the back of the sofa , saying , " Yes , and you do both in your speeches . One just has to respond , even when one is n't too clear as to your meaning . Only I do know what you 're saying and that 's even more inspiring . " " Actually , you know , I 'm as much affected by the audience as it is by me . Its response helps me do my best . " " And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which concerns me greatly . It provides women the full opportunity for self-expression , which is so very important , Brother . It 's as though every day were Leap Year  --  which is as it should be . Women should be absolutely as free as men . " And if I were really free , I thought , lifting my glass , I 'd get the hell out of here . " I thought you were exceptionally good tonight  --  it 's time the  | woman had a champion in the movement . Until tonight I 'd always heard you on minority problems . " " This is a new assignment , " I said . " But from now on one of our main concerns is to be the Woman Question . " " That 's wonderful and it 's about time . Something has to give women an opportunity to come to close grips with life . Please go on , tell me your ideas , " she said , pressing forward , her hand light upon my arm . And I went on talking , relieved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth of the wine . And it was only when I turned to ask a question of her that I realized that she was leaning only a nose-tip away , her eyes upon my face . " Go on , please go on , " I heard . " You make it sound so clear ? please . " I saw the rapid , moth-wing fluttering of her lids become the softness of her lips as we were drawn together . There was not an idea or concept in it but sheer warmth ; then the bell was ringing and I shook it off and got to my feet , hearing it ring again as she arose with me , the red robe falling in heavy folds upon the carpet , and she saying , " You make it all so wonderfully alive , " as the bell sounded again . And I was trying to move , to get out of the apartment , looking for my hat and filling with anger , thinking , Is she crazy ? Does n't she hear ? as she stood before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now taking my arm with sudden energy , saying , " This way , in here , " almost pulling me along as the bell rang again , through a door down a short hall , a satiny bedroom , in which she stood appraising me with a smile , saying , " This is mine , " as I looked at her in outrageous disbelief . " Yours , yours ? But what about that bell ? " " Never mind , " she cooed , looking into my eyes . " But be reasonable , " I said , pushing her aside . " What about that door ? " " Oh , of course , you mean the telephone , do n't you , darling ? " " But your old man-your husband ? " " In Chicago ? " " But he might not ? " " No , no , darling , he wo n't ? " " But he might ! " " But , Brother , darling , I talked with him , I know . "  | " You what ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you poor darling ! It is n't a game , really you have no cause to worry , we 're free . He 's in Chicago , seeking his lost youth , no doubt , " she said , bursting into laughter of self-surprise . " He 's not at all interested in uplifting things  --  freedom and necessity , woman 's rights and all that . You know , the sickness of our class  --  Brother , darling . " I took a step across the room ; there was another door to my left through which I saw the gleam of chromium and tile . " Brotherhood , darling , " she said , gripping my biceps with her little hands . " Teach me , talk to me . Teach me the beautiful ideology of Brotherhood . " And I wanted both to smash her and to stay with her and knew that I should do neither . Was she trying to ruin me , or was this a trap set by some secret enemy of the movement waiting outside the door with cameras and wrecking bars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with forced calm , trying to release my hands without touching her , for if I touched her ? " And you 'll continue ? " she said . I nodded , seeing her turn without a word and go toward a vanity with a large oval mirror , taking up an ivory telephone . And in the mirrored instant I saw myself standing between her eager form and a huge white bed , myself caught in a guilty stance , my face taut , tie dangling ; and behind the bed another mirror which now like a surge of the sea tossed our images back and forth , back and forth , furiously multiplying the time and the place and the circumstance . My vision seemed to pulse alternately clear and vague , driven by a furious bellows as her lips said soundlessly , I 'm sorry , and then impatiently into the telephone , " Yes , this is she , " and then to me again , smiling as she covered the mouthpiece with her hand , " It 's only my sister ; it 'll only take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of male servants summoned to wash the mistress 's back ; chauffeurs sharing the masters ' wives ; Pullman porters invited into the drawing room of rich wives headed for Reno  --  thinking , But this is the movement , the Brotherhood . And now I saw her smile , saying , " Yes , Gwen , dear . Yes , " as one free hand went up as though to smooth her hair and in one swift motion the red robe swept aside like a veil , and I went breathless at the petite and generously curved nude , framed delicate and firm in the glass . It was like a dream interval and in an instant it swung back and I saw only her mysteriously smiling eyes above the rich red robe .  | I was heading for the door , torn between anger and it lien r exe itement , hearing the phone click down as I started past and feeling her swirl against me and I was lost , for the conflict between the ideological and- the biological , duty and desire , had become too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let them break down the door , whosoever will , let them come . I DIDN ' T know whether I was awake or dreaming . It was dead quiet , yet I was certain that there had been a noise and that it had come from across the room as she beside me made a soft sighing sound . It was strange . My mind revolved . I was chased out of a chinkapin woods by a bull . I ran up a hill ; the whole hill heaved . I heard the sound and looked up to see the man looking straight at me from where he stood in the dim light of the hall , looking in with neither interest nor surprise . His face expressionless , his eyes staring . There was the sound of even breathing . Then I heard her stir beside me . " Oh , hello , dear , " she said , her voice sounding far away . " Back so soon ? " " Yes , " he said . " Wake me early , I have a lot to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said sleepily . " Have a good night 's rest . . . - " Night , and you too , " he said with a short dry laugh . The door closed . I lay there in the dark for a while , breathing rapidly . It was strange . I reached out and touched her . There was no answer . I leaned over her , feeling her breath breezing warm and pure against my face . I wanted to linger there , experiencing the sensation of something precious perilously attained too late and now to be lost forever  --  a poignancy . But it was as though she 'd never been awake and if she should awaken now , ' she 'd scream , shriek . I slid hurriedly from the bed , keeping my eye on that part of the darkness from where the light had come as I tried to find my clothes . I blundered around , finding a chair , an empty chair . Where were my clothes ? What a fool ! Why had I gotten myself into such a situation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair with my clothes , dressed hurriedly and slipped out , halting only at the door to look back through the dim light from the hall . She slept without sigh or smile , a beautiful dreamer , one ivory arm flung above her jet-black head . My heart pounded as I closed the door  | and went down the hall , expecting the man , men , crowds  --  to halt me . Then I was taking the stairs . The building was quiet . In the lobby the doorman dozed , his starched bib buckling beneath his chin with his breathing , his white head bare . I reached the street limp with perspiration , still unsure whether I had seen the man or had dreamed him . Could I have seen him without his seeing me ? Or again , had he seen me and been silent out of sophistication , decadence , over-civilization ? I hurried down the street , my anxiety growing with each step . Why had n't he said something , recognized me , cursed me ? Attacked me ? Or at least been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test to discover how I would react to such pressure ? It was , after all , a point upon which our enemies would attack us violently . I walked in a sweat of agony . Why did they have to mix their women into everything ? Between us and everything we wanted to change in the world they placed a woman : socially , politically , economically . Why , goddamit , why did they insist upon confusing the class struggle with the ass struggle , debasing both us and them  --  all human motives ? All the next day I was in a state of exhaustion , waiting tensely for the plan to be revealed . Now I was certain that the man had been in the doorway , a man with a brief case who had looked in and given no definite sign that he had seen me . A man who had spoken like an indifferent husband , but who yet seemed to recall to me some important member of the Brotherhood  --  someone so familiar that my failure to identify him was driving me almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring of the telephone filled me with dread . I toyed with Tarp 's leg chain . If they do n't call by four o'clock , I 'm saved , I told myself . But still no sign , not even a call to a meeting . Finally I rang her number , hearing her voice , delighted , gay and discreet ; but no mention of the night or the man . And hearing her so composed and gay I was too embarrassed to bring it up . Perhaps this was the sophisticated and civilized way ? Perhaps he was there and they had an - understanding , a woman with full rights . Would I return for further discussion , she wanted to know . " Yes , of course , " I said . " Oh , Brother , " she said . I hung up with a mixture of relief and anxiety , unable to shrug off the notion that I had been tested and had failed . I went through the next week puzzling over it , and even more confused because I  | knew nothing definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ' in my relations with Brother Jack and the others , but they gave no sign . And even if they had , I would n't have known its definite mean ing , for it might have had to do with the charges . I was caught between guilt and innocence , so that now they seemed one and the same . My nerves were in a state of constant tension , my face took on a stiff , noncommittal expression , beginning to look like Brother Jack 's and the other leaders ' . Then I relaxed a bit ; work had to be done and I would play the waiting game . And despite my guilt and uncertainty I learned to forget that I was a lone guilty black Brother and to go striding confidently into a roomful of whites . It was chin up , a not too wide-stretched smile , the out-thrust hand for the firm warm hand shake . And with it just the proper mixture of arrogance and down-to-earth humility to satisfy all . I threw myself into the lectures , defending , asserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buzz around , I was careful to keep the biological and ideological carefully apart  --  which was n't always easy , for it was as though many of the sisters were agreed among themselves ( and assumed that I accepted it ) that the ideological was merely a superfluous veil for the real concerns of life . I found that most downtown audiences seemed to expect some unnamed something whenever I appeared . I could sense it the moment I stood before them , and it had nothing to do with anytiling I might say . For I had merely to appear before them , ; Ind from the moment they turned their eyes upon me they seemed to undergo a strange unburdening  --  not of laughter , nor of tears , nor of any stable , unmixed emotion . I did n't get it . And my guilt was aroused . Once in the middle of a passage I looked into the sea of faces and thought , Do they know ? Is that it ? ? and almost ruined my lecture . But of one thing I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cmain other black brothers who entertained them with stories so often that they laughed even before these fellows opened their mouths . No , it was something else . A form of expectancy , a mood of waiting , a hoping for something like justification ; as though they expected me to be more than just another speaker , or an entertainer . Something seemed to occur that was hidden from my own consciousness . I acted out a pantomime more eloquent than my most expressive words . I was a partner to it but could no more fathom it than I could the mystery of the man in the doorway . Perhaps , I told myself , it 's in your voice , after all . In your voice and in their desire to see in you a  | living proof of their belief in Brotherhood , and to ease my mind I stopped thinking about it . Then one night when I had fallen asleep while making notes for a new series of lectures , the phone summoned me to an emergency meeting at headquarters , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I thought , either the charges or the woman . To be tripped up by a woman ! What would I say to them , that she was irresistible and I human ? What had that to do with responsibility , with building Brotherhood ? It was all I could do to make myself go , and I arrived late . The room was sweltering ; three small fans stirred the heavy air , and the brothers sat in their shirtsleeves around a scarred table upon which a pitcher of iced water glistened with beads of moisture . " Brothers , I 'm sorry I 'm late , " I apologized . " There were some important last-minute details concerning tomorrow 's lecture that kept me . " " Then you might have saved yourself the trouble and the committee this lost time , " Brother Jack said . " I do n't understand you , " I said , suddenly feverish . " He means that you are no longer to concern yourself with the Woman Question . That 's ended , " Brother Tobitt said ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could respond Brother Jack fired a startling question at me . " What has become of Brother Tod Clifton ? " " Brother Clifton  --  why , I have n't seen him in weeks . I 've been too busy downtown here . What 's happened ? " " He has disappeared , " Brother Jack said , " disappeared ! So do n't waste time with superfluous questions . You were n't sent for for that . " " But how long has this been known ? " Brother Jack struck the table . " All we know is that he 's gone . Let 's get on with our business . You , Brother , are to return to Harlem immediately . We 're facing a crisis there , since Brother Tod Clifton has not only disappeared but failed in his assignment . On the other hand , Ras the Exhorter and his gang of racist gangsters are taking advantage of this and are increasing their agitation . You are to get back there and take measures to regain our strength in the community . You 'll be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a strategy meeting about which you 'll be notified tomorrow . And please , " he emphasized with his gavel , " be on time ! " I was so relieved that none of my own problems were discussed  | that I did n't linger to ask if the police had been consulted about the disappearance . Something was wrong with the whole deal , for Clifton was too responsible and had too much to gain simply to have appeared . Did it have any connection with Ras the Exhorter ? But that seemed unlikely ; Harlem was one of our strongest districts , and just a month ago when I was shifted Ras would have been laughed off the street had he tried to attack us . If only I had n't been so careful not to offend the committee I would have kept in closer contact with Clifton and the whole Harlem membership . Now it was as though I had been suddenly awakened from a deep sleep .  | CHAPTER 10 I HAD BEEN away long enough for the streets to seem strange . The uptown rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension was in the hot night air . I made my way through the summer crowds , not to the district but to Barrelhouse 's Jolly Dollar , a dark hole of a bar and grill on upper Eighth Avenue , where one of my best contacts , Brother Maceo , could usually be found about this time , having his evening 's beer . Looking through the window , I could see men in working clothes and a few rummy women leaning at the bar , and down the aisle between the bar and counter were a couple of men in black and blue checked sport shirts eating barbecue . A cluster of men and women hovered near the juke box at the rear . But when I went in Brother Maceo was n't among them and I pushed to the bar , deciding to wait over a beer . " Good evening , Brothers , " I said , finding myself beside two men whom I had seen around before ; only to have them look at me oddly , the eyebrows of the tall one raising at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit , " the tall man said . " You said it , man ; he a relative of yourn ? " " Shit , he goddam sho ai n't no kin of mine ! " I turned and looked at them , the room suddenly cloudy . " He must be drunk , " the second man said . " Maybe he thinks he 's kin to you . " " Then his whiskey 's telling him a damn lie . I would n't be his kin even if I was ? Hey , Barrelhouse ! " I moved away , down the bar , looking at them out of a feeling of  | suspense . They did n't sound drunk and I had said nothing to offend , and I was certain that they knew who I was . What was it ? The Brotherhood greeting was as familiar as " Give me some skin " or " Peace , it 's wonderful . " I saw Barrelhouse rolling down from the other end of the bar , his white apron indented by the tension of its cord so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has a groove around its middle ; and seeing me now , he began to smile . " Well , I 'll be damned if it ai n't the good brother , " he said , stretching out his hand . " Brother , where you been keeping yourself ? " " I 've been working downtown , " I said , feeling a surge of gratitude . " Fine , fine ! " Barrelhouse said . " Business good ? " " I 'd rather not discuss it , Brother . Business is bad . Very bad . " " I 'm sorry to hear it . You 'd better give me a beer , " I said , " after you 've served these gentlemen . " I watched them in the mirror . " Sure thing , " Barrelhouse said , reaching for a glass and drawing a beer . " What you putting down , ole man ? " he said to the tall man . " Look here , Barrel , we wanted to ask you one question , " the tall one said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us just whose brother this here cat 's supposed to be ? He come in here just now calling everybody brother . " " He 's my brother , " Barrel said , holding the foaming glass between his long fingers . " Anything wrong with that ? " " Look , fellow , " I said down the bar , " that 's our way of speaking . I meant no harm in calling you brother . I 'm sorry you misunderstood me . " " Brother , here 's your beer , " Barrelhouse said . " So he 's your brother , eh , Barrel ? " Barrel 's eyes narrowed as he pressed his huge chest across the bar , looking suddenly sad . " You enjoying yourself , MacAdams ? " he said gloomily . " You like your beer ? " " Sho , " MacAdams said . " It cold enough ? " " Sho , but Barrel ? " " You like the groovy music on the juke ? " Barrelhouse said . " Hell , yes , but ? " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sho , but that ai n't what I 'm talking about , " the man said . " Yeah , but that 's what I 'm talking about , " Barrelhouse said  | mournfully . " And if you like it , like it , and do n't start trying to bug my other customers . This here man 's done more for the community than you 'll ever do . " " What community ? " MacAdams said , cutting his eyes around toward me . " I hear he got the white fever and left ... " " You liable to hear anything , " Barrelhouse said . " There 's some paper back there in the gents ' room . You ought to wipe out your ears . " " Never mind my ears . " " Aw come on , Mac , " his friend said . " Forgit it . Ai n't the man done apologized ? " " I said never mind my ears , " MacAdams said . " You just tell your brother he ought to be careful ' bout who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so much of his kind of politics . " I looked from one to the other . I considered myself beyond the stage of street-fighting , and one of the worst things I could do upon returning to the community was to engage in a brawl . I looked at MacAdams and was glad when the other man pushed him down the bar . " That MacAdams thinks he 's tight , " Barrelhouse said . " He 's the kind caint nobody please . Be frank though , there 's lots feel like that now . " I shook my head in bafflement . I 'd never met that kind of antagonism before . " What 's happened to Brother Maceo ? " I said . " I do n't know , Brother . He do n't come in so regular these days . Things are kinda changing up here . Ai n't much money floating around . " " Times are hard everywhere . But what 's been going on up here , Barrel ? " I said . " Oh , you know how it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got jobs through you people have lost them . You know how it goes . " " You mean people in our organization ? " " Quite a few of them are . Fellows like Brother Maceo . " " But why ? They were doing all right . " " Sure they was  --  as long as you people was fighting for ' em . But the minute y'all stopped , they started throwing folks out on the street . " I looked at him , big and sincere before me . It was unbelievable that the Brotherhood had stopped its work , and yet he was n't lying .  | " Give me another beer , " I said . Then someone called him from As back , and he drew the beer and left . I drank it slowly , hoping Brother Maceo would appear before I had finished . When he did n't I waved to Barrelhouse and left for the district . Perhaps Brother Tarp could explain ; or at least tell inc something about Clifton . I walked through the dark block over to Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along the way I saw not a single sign of Brotherhood activity . In a hot side street I came upon a couple striking matches along the curb , kneeling as though looking for a lost coin , the matches flaring dimly in their faces . Then I found myself in a strangely familiar block and broke out in a sweat : I had walked almost to Mary 's door , and turned now and hurried away . Barrelhouse had prepared me for the darkened windows of the district , but not , when I let myself in , to call in vain through the dark to Brother Tarp . I went to the room where he slept , but he was not there ; then I went through the dark hall to my old office and threw myself into my desk chair , exhausted . Everything seemed to be slipping away from me and I could find no quick absorbing action that would get it under control . I tried to think of whom among the district committee I might call for information concerning ( lifton , but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who believed that I had requested to be transferred because I hated my own people it would only complicate matters . No doubt there would be some who 'd resent my return , so it was best to confront them all at once without giving any one of them the opportunity to organize any sentiment against me . It was best that I talk with Brother Tarp , wluttn I trusted . When he came in he could give me an idea of the State of affairs , and perhaps tell me what had actually happened to Clifton . But Brother Tarp did n't arrive . I went out and got a ( ont.tiner of coffee and returned to spend the night poring over the district 's records . When he had n't returned by three A.M. I went to his room and took a look around . It was empty , even the bed was gone . I 'm all alone , I thought . A lot has occurred about which I was n't told ; something that had not only stifled the members ' interest but which , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barrelhouse had said that the organization had quit fighting , and that was the only explanation I could find for Brother Tarp 's leaving . Unless , of course , he 'd had disagreements with Clifton or some of the other  | leaders . And now returning to my desk I noticed his gift of Douglass ' portrait was gone . I felt in my pocket for the leg chain , at least I had n't forgotten to take that along . I pushed the records aside ; they told me nothing of why things were as they were . Picking up the telephone I called Clifton 's number , hearing it ring on and on . Finally I gave it up and went to sleep in my chair . Everything had to wait until the strategy meeting . Returning to the district was like returning to a city of the dead . Somewhat to my surprise there were a good number of members in the hall when I awoke , and having no directives from the committee on how to proceed I organized them into teams to search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . Brother Clifton had appeared at the district as usual up to the time of his disappearance . There had been no quarrels with committee members , and he was as popular as ever . Nor had there been any clashes with Ras the Exhorter  --  although in the past week he had been increasingly active . As for the loss of membership and influence , it was a result of a new program which had called for the shelving of our old techniques of agitation . There had been , to my surprise , a switch in emphasis from local issues to those more national and international in scope , and it was felt that for the moment the interests of Harlem were not of first importance . I did n't know what to make of it , since there had been no such change of program downtown . Clifton was forgotten , everything which I was to do now seemed to depend upon getting an explanation from the committee , and I waited with growing agitation to be called to the strategy meeting . Such meetings were usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But by eleven-thirty I had received no word and I became worried . By twelve an uneasy sense of isolation took hold of me . Something was cooking , but what , how , why ? Finally I phoned headquarters , but could reach none of the leaders . What is this , I wondered ; then I called the leaders of other districts with the same results . And now I was certain that the meeting was being held . But why without me ? Had they investigated Wrestrum 's charges and decided they were true ? It seemed that the membership had fallen off after I had gone downtown . Or was it the woman ? Whatever it was , now was not the time to leave me out of a meeting ; things were too urgent in the district . I hurried down to headquarters . When I arrived the meeting was in session , just as I expected , and word had been left that it was not to be disturbed by anyone . It was  | obvious that they had n't forgotten to notify me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , I thought , when they do decide to call me they 'll have to find me . I should never have been shifted in the first place , and now that I was sent back to clean up the mess they should aid me as quickly as possible . I would do no more running downtown , nor would I accept any program that they sent up without consulting the Harlem committee . Then I decided , of all things , to shop for a pair of new shoes , and walked over to Fifth Avenue . It was hot , the walks still filled with noontime crowds moving with reluctance back to their jobs . I moved along close to the curb to avoid the bumping and agitated changes of pace , the chattering women in summer dresses , finally entering the leather-smelling , aircooled interior of the shoe store with a sense of relief . My feet felt light in the new summer shoes as I went back into the blazing heat , and I recalled the old boyhood pleasure of discarding winter shoes for sneakers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speedy , floating sensation . Well , I thought , you 've run your last foot race and you 'd better get back to the district in case you 're called . I hurried now , my feet feeling trim and light as I moved through the oncoming rush of sunbeaten faces . To avoid the crowd on Forty-second Street I turned off at Forty-third and it was here that things began to boil . A small fruit wagon with an array of bright peaches and pears stood near the curb , and the vendor , a florid man with bulbous nose and bright black Italian eyes , looked at me knowingly from beneath his huge white-and-orange umbrella then over toward a crowd that had formed alongside the building across the street . What 's wrong with him ? I thought . Then I was across the street and passing the group standing with their backs to me . A clipped , insinuating voice spieled words whose meaning I could n't catch and I was about to pass on when I saw the boy . He was a slender brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifton 's , and who now was looking intently across the tops of cars to where down the block near the post office on the other side a tall policeman was approaching . Perhaps he 'll know something , I thought , as he looked around to see me and stopped in confusion . " Hello , there , " I began , and when he turned toward the crowd and whistled I did n't know whether he was telling me to do the same or signaling to someone else . I swung around , seeing him step to where a large carton sat beside the building and sling its canvas straps  | to his shoulder as once more he looked toward the policeman , ignoring me . Puzzled , I moved into the crowd and pressed to the front where at my feet I saw a square piece of cardboard upon which something was moving with furious action . It was some kind of toy and I glanced at the crowd 's fascinated eyes and down again , seeing it clearly this time . I 'd seen nothing like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin flat cardboard disks forming its head and feet and which some mysterious mechanism was causing to move up and down in a loose-jointed , shoulder-shaking , infuriatingly sensuous motion , a dance that was completely detached from the black , mask-like face . It 's no jumping-jack , but what , I thought , seeing the doll throwing itself about with the fierce defiance of someone performing a degrading act in public , dancing as though it received a perverse pleasure from its motions . And beneath the chuckles of the crowd I could hear the swishing of its ruffled paper , while the same **30;929;TOOLONG voice continued to spiel : Shake it up ! Shake it up ! He 's Sambo , the dancing doll , ladies and gentlemen . Shake him , stretch him by the neck and set him down , ? He 'll do the rest . Yes ! He 'll make you laugh , he 'll make you sigh , si-igh . He 'll make you want to dance , and dance Here you are , ladies and gentlemen , Sambo , The dancing doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your girl friend and she 'll love you , loove you ! He 'll keep you entertained . He 'll make you weep sweet ? Tears from laughing . Shake him , shake him , you can not break him For he 's Sambo , the dancing , Sambo , the prancing , Sambo , the entrancing , Sambo Boogie Woogie paper doll . And all for twenty-five cents , the quarter part of a dollar .. . Ladies and gentlemen , he 'll bring you joy , step up and meet him , Sambo the I knew I should get back to the district but I was held by the inanimate , boneless bouncing of the grinning doll and struggled between the desire to join in the laughter and to leap upon it with both feet ,  | when it suddenly collapsed and I saw the tip of the spieler 's toe press upon the circular cardboard that formed the feet and a broad hl.ta k hand come down , its fingers deftly lifting the doll 's head and strcn If ing it upward , twice its length , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't go with the hand . It was as though I had waded out into a shallow pool only to have the bottom drop out and the water close over my head . I looked up . " Not you . . . " I began . But his eyes looked past me deliberately unseeing . I was paralyzed , looking at him , knowing I was n't dreaming , hearing : What makes him happy , what makes him dance , This Sambo , this jambo , this high-stepping joy boy ? He 's more than a toy , ladies and gentlemen , he 's Sambo , the dancing doll , the twentieth-century miracle . Look at that rumba , that Suzy-q , he 's Sambo-Boggie , Sambo-Woogie , you do n't have to feed him , he sleeps collapsed , he 'll kill your depression And your dispossession , he lives upon the sunshine of your lordly smile And only twenty-five cents , the brotherly two bits of a dollar because he wants me to eat . It gives him pleasure to see me eat . You simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the rest . Thank you , lady . . . It was Clifton , riding easily back and forth in his knees , flexing his legs without shifting his feet , his right shoulder raised at an angle and his arm pointing stiffly at the bouncing doll as he spieled from the corner of his mouth . The whistle came again , and I saw him glance quickly toward his lookout , the boy with the carton . " Who else wants little Sambo before we take it on the limbo ? Speak up , ladies and gentlemen , who wants little .. . ? " And again the whistle . " Who wants Sambo , the dancing , prancing ? Hurry , hurry , ladies and gentlemen . There 's no license for little Sambo , the joy spreader . You ca n't tax joy , so speak up , ladies and gentlemen . . . For a second our eyes met and he gave me a contemptuous smile , then he spieled again . I felt betrayed . I looked at the doll and felt  | my throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked back on my heels and crouched forward . There was a flash of whiteness and a splatter like heavy rain striking a newspaper and I saw the doll go over backwards , wilting into a dripping rag of frilled tissue , the hateful head upturned on its outstretched neck still grinning toward the sky . The crowd turned on me indignantly . The whistle came again . I saw a short pot-bellied man look down , then up at me with amazement and explode with laughter , pointing from me to the doll , rocking . People backed away from me . I saw Clifton step close to the building where beside the fellow with the carton I now saw a whole chorus-line of dolls flouncing themselves with a perverse increase of energy and the crowd laughing hysterically . " You , you ! " I began , only to see him pick up two of the dolls and step forward . But now the lookout came close . " He 's coming , " he said , nodding toward the approaching policeman as he swept up the dolls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow little Sambo around the corner , ladies and gentlemen , " Clifton called . " There 's a great show coming up . . . It happened so fast that in a second only I and an old lady in a blue polka-dot dress were left . She looked at me then back to the walk , smiling . I saw one of the dolls . I looked . She was still smiling and I raised my foot to . crush it , hearing her cry , " Oh , no ! " The policeman was just opposite and I reached down instead , picking it up and walking off in the same motion . I examined it , strangely weightless in my hand , half expecting to feel it pulse with life . It was a still frill of paper . I dropped it in the pocket where I carried Brother Tarp 's chain link and started after the vanished crowd . But I could n't face Clifton again . I did n't want to see him . I might forget myself and attack him . I went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman . What a way to find him , I thought . What had happened to Clifton ? It was all so wrong , so unexpected . How on earth could he drop from Brotherhood to this in so short a time ? And why if he had to fall back did he try to carry the whole structure with him ? What would non-members who knew him say ? It was as though he had chosen  --  how had he put it the night he fought with Ras ? ? to fall outside of history . I stopped in the middle of the walk with the thought . " To plunge , " he had said . But he knew that only in the Brotherhood could we make ourselves known , could we avoid being empty Sambo dolls . Such an obscene flouncing of everything human ! My God ! And I had been worrying about being  | left out of a meeting ! I 'd overlook it a thousand times ; no matter why I was n't called . I 'd forget it and hold on desperately to Brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to plunge . . . To plunge ! And those dolls , where had they found them ? Why had he picked that way to earn a quarter ? Why not sell apples or song sheets , or shine shoes ? I wandered past the subway and continued around the corner to Forty-second Street , my mind grappling for meaning . And when I came around the corner onto the crowded walk into the sun , they were already lining the curb and shading their faces with their hands . I saw the traffic moving with the lights , and across the street a few pedestrians were looking back toward the center of the block where the trees of Bryant Park rose above two men . I saw a flight of pigeons whirl out of the trees and it all happened in the swift interval of their circling , very abruptly and in the noise of the traffic  --  yet seeming to unfold in my mind like a slow-motion movie run off with the sound track dead . At first I thought it was a cop and a shoeshine boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the sun-glaring bands of trolley rails I recognized Clifton . His partner had disappeared now and Clifton had the box slung to his left shoulder with the cop moving slowly behind and to one side of him . They were coming my way , passing a newsstand , and I saw the rails in the asphalt and a fire plug at the curb and the flying birds , and thought , You 'll have to follow and pay his fine . . . just as the cop pushed him , jolting hint forward and Clifton trying to keep the box from swinging against his leg and saying something over his shoulder and going forward as one of the pigeons swung down into the street and up again , leavint ; a feather floating white in the dazzling backlight of the sun , and I ( mild see the cop push Clifton again , stepping solidly forward in his lhl.uk shirt , his arm shooting out stiffly , sending him in it head snapping forward stumble until he caught himself , saying something over his shoulder again , the two moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times , but never with anyone like Clifton . And I e unnld see the cop bark a command and lunge forward , thrusting , out his arm and missing , thrown off balance as suddenly Clifton spun on his toes like a dancer and swung his right arm over and around in a short , jolting arc , his torso carrying forward and to the left in a motion that sent the box strap free as his right foot traveled forward and his left arm followed through in a floating uppercut that sent the cop 's cap sail-  | ing into the street and his feet flying , to drop him hard , rocking from left to right on the walk as Clifton kicked the box thudding aside and crouched , his left foot forward , his hands high , waiting . And between the flashing of cars I could see the cop propping himself on his elbows like a drunk trying to get his head up , shaking it and thrusting it forward ? And somewhere between the dull roar of traffic and the subway vibrating underground I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though blackjacked by the sound , and the cop sitting up straight now , and rising to his knees looking steadily at Clifton , and the pigeons plummeting swiftly into the trees , and Clifton still facing the cop and suddenly crumpling . He fell forward on his knees , like a man saying his prayers just as a heavy-set man in a hat with a turned-down brim stepped from around the newsstand and yelled a protest . I could n't move . The sun seemed to scream an inch above my head . Someone shouted . A few men were starting into the street . The cop was standing now and looking down at Clifton as though surprised , the gun in his hand . I took a few steps forward , walking blindly now , unthinking , yet my mind registering it all vividly . Across and starting up on the curb , and seeing Clifton up closer now , lying in the same position , on his side , a huge wetness growing on his shirt , and I could n't set my foot down . Cars sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step that would raise me up to the walk . I stood there , one leg in the street and the other raised above the curb , hearing whistles screeching and looked toward the library to see two cops coming on in a lunging , big-bellied run . I looked back to Clifton , the cop was waving me away with his gun , sounding like a boy with a changing voice . " Get back on the other side , " he said . He was the cop that I 'd passed on Forty-third a few minutes before . My mouth was dry . " He 's a friend of mine , I want to help . . . " I said , finally stepping upon the curb . " He do n't need no help , Junior . Get across that street ! " The cop 's hair hung on the sides of his face , his uniform was dirty , and I watched him without emotion , hesitated , hearing the sound of footfalls approaching . Everything seemed slowed down . A pool formed slowly on the walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cop looked at me curiously . Above in the park I could hear the furious flapping of wings ; on my neck , the pressure of eyes . I turned . A round-headed , apple-cheeked boy with thickly freckled nose and Slavic eyes leaned over the fence of the park above , and now as he  | saw me turn , he shrilled something to someone behind him , his fact lighting up with ecstasy . . . What does it mean , I wondered , turning back to that to which I did not wish to turn . There were three cops now , one watching the crowd and the others looking at Clifton . The first cop had his cap on again . " Look , Junior , " he said very clearly , " I had enough trouble for today  --  you going to get on across that street ? " I opened my mouth but nothing would come . Kneeling , one of the cops was examining Clifton and making notes on a pad . " I 'm his friend , " I said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cooked pigeon , Mac , " he said . " You ai n't got any friend any more . " I looked at him . " Hey , Mickey , " the boy above us called , " the guy 's out cold ! " I looked down . " That 's right , " the kneeling cop said . " What 's your name ? " I told him . I answered his questions about Clifton as best I could until the wagon came . For once it came quickly . I watched numbly as they moved him inside , placing the box of dolls in with him . Across the street the crowd still churned . Then the wagon was gone and I started back toward the subway . " Say , mister , " the boy 's voice shrilled down . " Your friend sure knows how to use his dukes . Biff , bang ! One , two , and the cop 's on his ass ! " I bowed my head to this final tribute , and now walking away in the sun I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the subway stairs seeing nothing , my mind plunging . The subway was cool and I leaned against a pillar , hearing the roar of trains passing across on the other side , feeling the rushing roar of air . Why should a man deliberately plunge outside of history and peddle an obscenity , my mind went on abstractedly . Why should he choose to disarm himself , give up his voice and leave the only organization offering him a chance to " define " himself ? The platform vibrated and I looked down . Bits of paper whirled up in the passage of air , settling quickly as a train moved past . Why had he turned away ? Why had he chosen to step off the platform and fall beneath the train ? Why did he choose to plunge into nothingness , into the void of faceless faces , of soundless voices , lying outside history ? I  | tried to step away and look at it from a distance of words read in books , half-remembered . For history records the patterns of men 's lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ; who fought and who won and who lived to lie about it afterwards . All things , it is said , are duly recorded  --  all things of importance , that is . But not quite , for actually it is only the known , the seen , the heard and only those events that the recorder regards as important that are put down , those lies his keepers keep their power by . But the cop would be Clifton 's historian , his judge , his witness , and his executioner , and I was the only brother in the watching crowd . And I , the only witness for the defense , knew neither the extent of his guilt nor the nature of his crime . Where were the historians today ? And how would they put it down ? I stood there with the trains plunging in and out , throwing blue sparks . What did they ever think of us transitory ones ? Ones such as I had been before I found Brotherhood  --  birds of passage who were too obscure for learned classification , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natures too ambiguous for the most ambiguous words , and too distant from the centers of historical decision to sign or even to applaud the signers of historical documents ? We who write no novels , histories or other books . What about us , I thought , seeing Clifton again in my mind and going to sit upon a bench as a cool gust of air rolled up the tunnel . A body of people came down the platform , some of them Negroes . Yes , I thought , what about those of us who shoot up from the South into the busy city like wild jacks-in-the-box broken loose from our springs  --  so sudden that our gait becomes like that of deep-sea divers suffering from the bends ? What about those fellows waiting still and silent there on the platform , so still and silent that they clash with the crowd in their very immobility ; standing noisy in their very silence ; harsh as a cry of terror in their quietness ? What about those three boys , coming now along the platform , tall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too-hot-forsummer suits , their collars high and tight about their necks , their identical hats of black cheap felt set upon the crowns of their heads with a severe formality above their hard conked hair ? It was as though I 'd never seen their like before : Walking slowly , their shoulders swaying , their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles ; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of  | natural western men . These fellows whose bodies seemcd  --  what had one of my teachers said of me ? ? " You 're like one of these African sculptures , distorted in the interest of a design . " Well , what de , tign and whose ? I stared as they seemed to move like dancers in some kind of funeral ceremony , swaying , going forward , their black faces sec rct , moving slowly down the subway platform , the heavy heel-plated shoes making a rhythmical tapping as they moved . Everyone must have seen them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pomade on their hair  --  or perhaps failed to see them at all . For they were men outside of historical time , they were untouched , they did n't believe in Brotherhood , no doubt had never heard of it ; or perhaps like Clifton would mysteriously have rejected its mysteries ; men of transition whose faces were immobile . I got up and went behind them . Women shoppers with bundles and impatient men in straw hats and seersucker suits stood along the platform as they passed . And suddenly I found myself thinking , Do they come to bury the others or to be entombed , to give life or to receive it ? Do the others see them , think about them , even those standing close enough to speak ? And if they spoke back , would the impatient businessmen in conventional suits and tired housewives with their plunder , understand ? What would they say ? For the boys speak a jived-up transitional language full of country glamour , think transitional thoughts , though perhaps they dream the same old ancient dreams . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men out of time , who would soon be gone and forgotten . . . But who knew ( and now I began to tremble so violently I had to lean against a refuse can ) ? who knew but that they were the saviors , the true leaders , the bearers of something precious ? ' 1'hc stewards of something uncomfortable , burdensome , which they hated because , living outside the realm of history , there was no one to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it . What if Brother Jack were wrong ? What if history was a gambler , instead of a force in a laboratory experiment , and the boys his ace in the hole ? What if history was not a reasonable citizen , but a madman full of paranoid guile and these boys his agents , his big surprise ! His own revenge ? For they were outside , in the dark with Sambo , the dancing paper doll ; taking it on the lambo with my fallen brother , Tod Clifton ( Tod , Tod ) running and dodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | A train came . I followed them inside . There were many seats and the three sat together . I stood , holding onto the center pole , looking down the length of the car . On one side I saw a white nun in black telling her beads , and standing before the door across the aisle there was another dressed completely in white , the exact duplicate of the other except that she was black and her black feet bare . Neither of the nuns was looking at the other but at their crucifixes , and suddenly I laughed and a verse I 'd heard long ago at the Golden Day paraphrased itself in my mind : Bread and Wine , Bread and Wine , Your cross ai n't nearly so Heavy as mine . . . And the nuns rode on with lowered heads . I looked at the boys . They sat as formally as they walked . From time to time one of them would look at his reflection in the window and give his hat brim a snap , the others watching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight ahead . I staggered with the lunging of the train , feeling the overhead fans driving the hot air down upon me . What was I in relation to the boys , I wondered . Perhaps an accident , like Douglass . Perhaps each hundred years or so men like them , like me , appeared in society , drifting through ; and yet by all historical logic we , I , should have disappeared around the first part of the nineteenth century , rationalized out of existence . Perhaps , like them , I was a throwback , a small distant meteorite that died several hundred years ago and now lived only by virtue of the light that speeds through space at too great a pace to realize that its source has become a piece of lead . . . This was silly , such thoughts . I looked at the boys ; one tapped another on the knee , and I saw him remove three rolled magazines from an inner pocket , passing two around and keeping one for himself . The others took theirs silently and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high before his face and for an instant I saw a vivid scene : The shining rails , the fire hydrant , the fallen policeman , the diving birds and in the mid-ground , Clifton , crumpling . Then I saw the cover of a comic book and thought , Clifton would have known them better than I. He knew them all the time . I studied them closely until they left the train , their shoulders rocking , their  | heavy heel plates clicking remote , cryptic messages in the brie ( silence of the train 's stop . I came out of the subway , weak , moving through the heat as though I carried a heavy stone , the weight of a mountain on my shoulders . My new shoes hurt my feet . Now , moving through the crowds along 125th Street , I was painfully aware of other men dressed like the boys , and of girls in dark exotic-colored stockings , their costumes surreal variations of downtown styles . They 'd been there all along , but somehow I 'd missed them . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were outside the groove of history , and it was my job to get them in , all of them . I looked into the design of their faces , hardly a one that was unlike someone I 'd known down South . Forgotten names sang through my head like forgotten scenes in dreams . I moved with the crowd , the sweat pouring off me , listening to the grinding roar of traffic , the growing sound of a record shop loudspeaker blaring a languid blues . I stopped . Was this alb-that would be recorded ? Was this the only true history of the times , a mood blared by trumpets , trombones , saxophones and drums , a song with turgid , inadequate words ? My mind flowed . It was as though in this short block I was forced to walk past everyone I 'd ever known and no one would smile or call my name . No one fixed me in his eyes . I walked in feverish isolation . Near the corner now a couple of boys darted out of the Five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walks as they ran with a man right behind . They came toward me , pumping past , and I killed an impulse to trip the man and was confused all the more when an old woman standing further along threw out tier leg and swung a heavy bag . The man went down , sliding across the walk as she shook her head in triumph . A pressure of guilt came over me . I stood on the edge of the walk watching the crowd threatening to attack , the man until a policeman appeared and dispersed them . And although I knew no one man could do much about it , I felt responsible . All our work had been very little ; no great change had been made . And it was all my fault . I 'd been so fascinated by the motion ' that I 'd forgotten to measure what it was bringing forth . 1 'd been asleep , dreaming .  | CHAPTER 21 WHEN I got back to the district a small group of youth members stopped their joking to welcome me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to the office with only a nod , shutting the door upon their voices and sat staring out through the trees . The once fresh green of the trees was dark and drying now and somewhere down below a clothesline peddler clanged his bell and called . Then , as I fought against it , the scene came back  --  not of the death , but of the dolls . Why had I lost my head and spat upon the doll , I wondered . What had Clifton felt when he saw me ? He must have hated me behind his spiel , . yet he 'd ignored me . Yes , and been amused by my political stupidity . I had blown up and acted personally instead of denouncing the significance of the dolls , him , the obscene idea , and seizing the opportunity to educate the crowd . We lost no opportunity to educate , and I had failed . All I 'd done was to make them laugh all the louder ... I had aided and abetted social backwardness .. . The scene changed  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail of , smoke left by a sky-writing plane lingering in the sky , a large woman in a kelly-green dress stood near me saying , " Oh , Oh ! " .. . I turned and faced the map , removing the doll from my pocket and tossing it upon the desk . My stomach surged . To die for such a thing ! I picked it up with an unclean feeling , looked at the frilled paper . The joined cardboard feet hung down , pulling the paper legs in elastic folds , a construction of tissue , cardboard and glue . And yet I felt a hatred as for something alive . What had made it seem to dance ? Its cardboard hands were doubled into fists , the fingers outlined in orange paint , and I noticed that it had two faces , one on either side of the disk of cardboard , and both grinning . Clifton 's voice  | came to me as he spieled his directions for making it dance , and I held it by the feet and stretched its neck , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning its other face around . It gave a tired flounce , shook itself and fell in a heap . " Go on , entertain me , " I said , giving it a stretch . " You entertained the crowd . " I turned it around . One face grinned as broadly as the other . It had grinned back at Clifton as it grinned forward at the crowd , and their entertainment had been his death . It had still grinned when I played the fool and spat upon it , and it was still grinning when Clifton ignored me . Then I saw a fine black thread and pulled it from the frilled paper . There was a loop tied in the end . I slipped it over my finger and stood stretching it taut . And this time it danced . Clifton had been making it dance all the time and the black thread had been invisible . Why did n't you hit him ? I asked myself ; try to break his jaw ? Why did n't you hurt him and save him ? You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been arrested with no shooting . . . But why had he resisted the cop anyway ? He 'd been arrested before ; he knew how far to go with a cop . What had the cop said to make him angry enough to lose his head ? And suddenly it occurred to me that he might have been angry before he resisted , before he 'd even seen the cop . My breath became short ; I felt myself go weak . What if he believed I 'd sold out ? It was a sickening thought . I sat holding myself as though I might break . For a moment I weighed the idea , but it was too big for me . I could only accept responsibility for the living , not for the dead . My mind backed away from the notion . The incident was political . I looked at the doll , thinking , The political equivalent of such entertainment is death . But that 's too broad a definition . Its economic meaning ? That the life of a man is worth the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kill the idea that my anger helped speed him on to death . And still my mind fought against it . For what had I to do with the crisis that had broken his integrity ? What had I to do with his selling the dolls in the first place ? And finally I had to give that up too . I was no detective , and , politically , individuals were without meaning . The shooting was all that was left of him now , Clifton had chosen to plunge out of history and , except for the picture it made in my mind 's eye , only the plunge was recorded , and that was the only important thing . I sat rigid , as though waiting to hear the explosions again , fighting  | against the weight that seemed to pull me down . I heard the clothesline peddler 's bell . . . What would I tell the committee when the newspaper accounts were out ? To hell with them . How would I explain the dolls ? But why should I say anything ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . The bell tolled again in the yard below . 1 looked at the doll . I could think of no justification for Clifton 's having sold the dolls , but there was justification enough for giving him a public funeral , and I seized upon the idea now as though it would save my life . Even though I wanted to turn away from it as I 'd wanted to turn from Clifton 's crumpled body on the walk . But the odds against us were too great for such weakness . We had to use every politically effective weapon against them ; Clifton understood that . He had to be buried and I knew of no relatives ; someone had to see that he was placed in the ground . Yes , the dolls were obscene and his act a betrayal . But he was only a salesman , not the inventor , and it was necessary that we make it known that the meaning of his death was greater than the incident or the object that caused it . Both as a means of avenging him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of attracting lost members back into the ranks . It would be ruthless , but a ruthlessness in the interest of Brotherhood , for we had only our minds and bodies , as against the other side 's vast power . We had to make the most of what we had . For they had the power to use a paper doll , first to destroy his integrity and then as an excuse , for killing him . All right , so we 'll use his funeral to put his integrity together again . . . For that 's all that he had had or wanted . And now I could see the doll only vaguely and drops of moisture were thudding down upon its absorbent paper . . . I was bent over , staring , when the knock came at the door and I jumped as at a shot , sweeping the doll into my pocket , and hastily wiping my eyes . " Come in , " I said . The door opened slowly . A group of youth members crowded forward , their faces a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " they said . " That he is dead ? Yes , " I said , looking among them . " Yes . " " But why . . . ? " " It was a case of provocation and murder ! " I said , my emotions beginning to turn to anger . They stood there , their faces questioning me.  | " He 's dead , " a girl said , her voice without conviction . " Dead . " " But what do they mean about his selling dolls ? " a toll youth said . " I do n't know , " I said . " I only know that he was shot down . t In armed . I know how you feel , I saw him fall . " " Take me home , " a girl screamed . " Take me home ! " I stepped forward and caught her , a little brown thing in bobby socks , holding her against me . " No , we ca n't go home , " I said , " none of us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the air and forget it , if I ever could . What we want is not tears but anger . We n l u ; t remember now that we are fighters , and in such incidents we must see the meaning of our struggle . We must strike back . I want each of you to round up all the members you can . We 've got to make our reply . " One of the girls was still crying piteously when they went out , but they were moving quickly . " Come on , Shirley , " they said , taking the girl from my shoulder . I tried to get in touch with headquarters , but again I was unable to reach anyone . I called the Chthonian but there was no answer . So I called a committee of the district 's leading members and we moved slowly ahead on our own . I tried to find the youth who was with Clifton , but he had disappeared . Members were set on the streets with cans to solicit funds for his burial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim his body . We distributed blackbordered leaflets , denouncing the police commissioner . Preac hers were notified to have their congregations send letters of protest to the mayor . The story spread . A photograph of Clifton was sent to the Negro papers and published . People were stirred and angry . Street meetings were organized . And , released ( by the action ) from my indecision , I threw everything I had into organizing the funeral , though moving in a kind of numb suspension . I did n't go to bell for two days and nights , but caught catnaps at my desk . I ate very little , THE funeral was arranged to attract the largest number . Instead of holding it in a church or chapel , we selected Mount Morris Park , and an appeal went out for all former members to join the funeral march . It took place on a Saturday , in the heat of the afternoon . There was a thin overcast of clouds , and hundreds of people formed for the procession . I went around giving orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe it all from off to one side .  | Brothers and sisters turned up whom I had n't seen since my return . And members from downtown and outlying districts . I watched them with surprise as they gathered and wondered at the depths of their sorrow as the lines began to form . There were half-draped flags and black banners . There were blackbordered signs that read : BROTHER TOD CLIFTON OUR HOPE SHOT DOWN There was a hired drum corps with crape-draped drums . There was a band of thirty pieces . There were no cars and very few flowers . It was a slow procession and the band played sad , romantic , military marches . And when the band was silent the drum corps beat the time on drums with muffled heads . It was hot and explosive , and delivery men avoided the district and the police details were increased in number . And up and down the streets people looked out of their apartment windows and men and boys stood on the roofs in the thinveiled sun . I marched at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march and as I looked back from time to time I could see young zoot-suiters , hep cats , and men in overalls and pool-hall gamblers stepping into the procession . Men came out of barber shops with lathered faces , their neckcloths hanging , to watch and comment in hushed voices . And I wondered , Are they all Clifton 's friends , or is it just for the spectacle , the slow-paced music ? A hot wind blew from behind me , bringing the sick sweetish odor , like the smell of some female dogs in season . I looked back . The sun shone down on a mass of unbared heads , and above flags and banners and shining horns I could see the cheap gray coffin moving high upon the shoulders of Clifton 's tallest companions , who from time to time shifted it smoothly on to others . They bore him high and they bore him proudly and there was an angry sadness in their eyes . The coffin floated like a heavily loaded ship in a channel , winding its way slowly above the bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drums with muffled snares , and all other sounds were suspended in silence . Behind , the tramp of feet ; ahead , the crowds lining the curbs for blocks . There were tears and muffled sobs and many hard , red eyes . We moved ahead . We wound through the poorer streets at first , a black image of sorrow , then turned into Seventh Avenue and down and over to  | Lenox . Then I hurried with the leading brothers to the park in a cab . A brother in the Park Department had opened the lookout tower , and a crude platform of planks and ranked saw horses had been erected beneath the black iron bell , and when the procession started into the park we were standing high above , waiting . At our signal he struck the bell , and I could feel my eardrums throbbing with the old , hollow , gut-vibrant Doom-Dong-Doom . Looking down , I could see them winding upward in a mass to the muffled sound of the drums . Children stopped their playing on the grass to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the roof to watch , their white uniforms glowing in the now unveiled sun like lilies . And crowds approached the park from all directions . The muffled drums now beating , now steadily rolling , spread a dead silence upon the air , a prayer for the unknown soldier . And looking down I felt a lostness . Why were they here ? Why had they found us ? Because they knew Clifton ? Or for the occasion his death gave them to express their protestations , a time and place to come together , to stand touching and sweating and breathing and looking in a common direction ? Was either explanation adequate in itself ? Did it signify love or politicalized hate ? And could politics ever be an expression of love ? Over the park the silence spread from the slow muffled rolling of the drums , the crunching of footsteps on the walks . Then somewhere in the procession an old , plaintive , masculine voice arose in a song , wavering , stumbling in the silence at first alone , until in the band a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , one catching and rising above the other and the other pursuing , two black pigeons rising above a skull-white barn to tumble and rise through still , blue air . And for a few bars the pure sweet tone of the horn and the old man 's husky baritone sang a duet in the hot heavy silence . " There 's Many a Thousand Gone . " And standing high up over the park something fought in my throat . It was a song from the past , the past of the campus and the still earlier past of home . And now some of the older ones in the mass were joining in . I had n't thought of it as a march ' before , but now they were marching to its slow-paced rhythm , up the hill . I looked for the euphonium player and saw a slender black man with his face turned toward the sun , singing through the upturned bells of the horn . And several yards behind , marching beside the young men floating the coffin upward , I looked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt a  | twinge of envy . It was a worn , old , yellow face and his eyes were closed and I could see a knife welt around his upturned neck as his throat threw out the song . He sang with his whole body , phrasing each verse as naturally as he walked , his voice rising above all the others , blending with that of the lucid horn . I watched him now , weteyed , the sun hot upon my head , and I felt a wonder at the singing mass . It was as though the song had been there all the time and he knew it and aroused it ; and I knew that I had known it too and had failed to release it out of a vague , nameless shame or fear . But he had known and aroused it . Even white brothers and sisters were joining in . I looked into that face , trying to plumb its secret , but it told me nothing . I looked at the coffin and the marchers , listening to them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a second I heard the shattering stroke of my heart . Something deep had shaken the crowd , and the old man and the man with the horn had done it . They had touched upon something deeper than protest , or religion ; though now images of all the church meetings of my life welled up within me with much suppressed and forgotten anger . But that was past , and too many of those now reaching the top of the mountain and spreading massed together had never shared it , and some had been born in other lands . And yet all were touched ; the song had aroused us all . It was not the words , for they were all the same old slave-borne words ; it was as though he 'd changed the emotion beneath the words while yet the old longing , resigned , transcendent emotion still sounded above , now deepened by that something for which the theory of Brotherhood had given me no name . I stood there trying to contain it as they brought Tod Clifton 's coffin into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it down upon the platform and I looked at the shape of the cheap gray coffin and all I could remember was the sound of his name . The song had ended . Now the top of the little mountain bristled with banners , horns and uplifted faces . I could look straight down Fifth Avenue to 125th Street , where policemen were lined behind an array of hot-dog wagons and Good Humor carts ; and among the carts I saw a peanut vendor standing beneath a street lamp upon which pigeons were gathered , and now I saw him stretch out his arms with his palms turned upward , and suddenly he was covered , head , shoulders and outflung arms , with fluttering , feasting birds . Someone nudged me and I started . It was time for final words . But I had no words and I 'd never been to a Brotherhood funeral and  | had no idea of a ritual . But they were waiting . I stood there alone ; there was no microphone to support me , only the coffin before me upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down into their sun-swept faces , digging for the words , and feeling a futility about it all and an anger . For this they gathered by thousands . What were they waiting to hear ? Why had they come ? For what reason that was different from that which had made the red-cheeked boy thrill at Clifton 's falling to the earth ? What did they want and what could they do ? Why had n't they come when they could have stopped it all ? " What are you waiting for me to tell you ? " I shouted suddenly , my voice strangely crisp on the windless air . " What good will it do ? What if I say that this is n't a funeral , that it 's a holiday celebration , that if you stick around the band will end up playing Damit-the-Hell the Fun 's All Over ' ? Or do you expect to see some magic , the dead rise up and walk again ? Go home , he 's as dead as he 'll ever die . That 's the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be no miracles and there 's no one here to preach a sermon . Go home , for , get him . He 's inside this box , newly dead . Go home and do n't think about him . He 's dead and you 've got all you can do to think about you . " I paused . They were whispering and looking upward . " I 've told you to go home , " I shouted , " but you keep standing there . Do n't you know it 's hot out here in the sun ? So what if you wait for what little I can tell you ? Can I say in twenty minutes what was building twenty-one years and ended in twenty seconds ? What are you waiting for , when all I can tell you is his name ? And when I tell you , what will you know that you did n't know already , except , perhaps , his name ? " They were listening intently , and as though looking not at me , but at the pattern of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do the listening in the sun and I 'll try to tell you in the sun . Then you go home and forget it . Forget it . His name was Clifton and they shot him down . His name was Clifton and he was tall and some folks thought him handsome . And though he did n't believe it , I think he was . His name was Clifton and his face was black and his hair was thick with tight-rolled curls  --  or call them naps or kinks . He 's dead , uninterested , and , except to a few young girls , it does n't matter . . . Have you got it ? Can you see him ? Think of your brother or your cousin John . His lips were thick with an upward curve at the corners . He often smiled . He had good eyes  | and a pair of fast hands , and he had a heart . He thought about things and he felt deeply . I wo n't call him noble because what 's such a word to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifton , and , like any man , he was born of woman to live awhile and fall and die . So that 's his tale to the minute . His name was Clifton and for a while he lived among us and aroused a few hopes in the young manhood of man , and we who knew him loved him and he died . So why are you waiting ? You 've heard it all . Why wait for more , when all I can do is repeat it ? " They stood ; they listened . They gave no sign . " Very well , so I 'll tell you . His name was Clifton and he was young and he was a leader and when he fell there was a hole in the heel of his sock and when he stretched forward he seemed not as tall as when he stood . So he died ; and we who loved him are gathered here to mourn him . It 's as simple as that and as short as that . His name was Clifton and he was black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell ? Is n't it all you need to know ? Is n't that enough to appease your thirst for drama and send you home to sleep it off ? Go take a drink and forget it . Or read it in The Daily News . His name was Clifton and they shot him , and I was there to see him fall . So I know it as I know it . " Here are the facts . He was standing and he fell . He fell and he kneeled . He kneeled and he bled . He bled and he died . He fell in a heap like any man and his blood spilled out like any blood ; red as any blood , wet as any blood and reflecting the sky and the buildings and birds and trees , or your face if you 'd looked into its dulling mirror  --  and it dried in the sun as blood dries . That 's all . They spilled his blood and he bled . They cut him down and he died ; the blood flowed on the walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile , became dull then dusty , then dried . That 's the story and that 's how it ended . It 's an old story and there 's been too much blood to excite you . Besides , it 's only important when it fills the veins of a living man . Are n't you tired of such stories ? Are n't you sick of the blood ? Then why listen , why do n't you go ? It 's hot out here . There 's the odor of embalming fluid . The beer is cold in the taverns , the saxophones will be mellow at the Savoy ; plenty good-laughing-lies will be told in the barber shops and beauty parlors ; and there 'll be sermons in two hundred churches in the cool of the evening , and plenty of laughs at the movies . Go listen to Amos and Andy ' and forget it . Here you have only the same old story . There 's not even a young  | wife up here in red to mourn him . There 's nothing here to pity , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that good old frightened feeling . The story 's too short and too simple . His name was Clifton , Tod Clifton , he was unarmed and his death was as senseless as his life was futile . He had struggled for Brotherhood on a hundred street corners and he thought it would make him more human , but he died like any dog in a road . " All right , all right , " I called out , feeling desperate . It was n't the way I wanted it to go , it was n't political . Brother Jack probably would n't approve of it at all , but I had to keep going as I could go . " Listen to me standing up on this so-called mountain ! " I shouted . " Let me tell it as it truly was ! His name was Tod Clifton and he was full of illusions . He thought he was a man when he was only Tod Clifton . He was shot for a simple mistake of judgment and he bled and his blood dried and shortly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake of which many are guilty : He thought he was a man and that men were not meant to be pushed around . But it was hot downtown and he forgot his history , he forgot the time and the place . He lost his hold on reality . There was a cop and a waiting audience but he was Tod Clifton and cops are everywhere . The cop ? What about him ? He was a cop . A good citizen . But this cop had an itching finger and an eager ear for a word that rhymed with trigger , ' and when Clifton fell he had found it . The Police Special spoke its lines and the rhyme was completed . Just look around you . Look at what he made , look inside you and feel his awful power . It was perfectly natural . The blood ran like blood in a comic-book killing , on a comic-book street in a comic-book town on a comic-book day in a comic-book world . " Tod Clifton 's one with the ages . But what 's that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now he 's part of history , and hr has received his true freedom . Did n't they scribble his name on a standardized pad ? His Race : colored ! Religion : unknown , probably born Baptist . Place of birth : U. S. Some southern town . Next of kin : unknown . Address : unknown . Occupation : unemployed . Cause of death ( be specific ) : resisting reality in the form of a .38 caliber revolver in the hands of the arresting officer , on Forty-second between the library and the subway in the heat of the afternoon , of gunshot wounds received from two bullets , fired at three paces , one bullet entering the right ventricle of the heart , and lodging there , the other severing the spinal ganglia traveling downward to lodge in the pelvis ,  | the other breaking through the back and traveling God knows where . " Such was the short bitter life of Brother Tod Clifton . Now he 's in this box with the bolts tightened down . He 's in the box and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this you can go . It 's dark in this box and it 's crowded . It has a cracked ceiling and a clogged-up toilet in the hall . It has rats and roaches , and it 's far , far too expensive a dwelling . The air is bad and it 'll be cold this winter . Tod Clifton is crowded and he needs the room . ' Tell them to get out of the box , ' that 's what he would say if you could hear him . ' Tell them to get out of the box and go teach the cops to forget that rhyme . Tell them to teach them that when they call you nigger to make a rhyme with trigger it makes the gun backfire . ' " So there you have it . In a few hours Tod Clifton will be cold bones in the ground . And do n't be fooled , for these bones shall not rise again . You and I will still be in the box . I do n't know if Tod Clifton had a soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , my sense of loss . I do n't know if you have a soul . I only know that you are men of flesh and blood ; and that blood will spill and flesh grow cold . I do not know if all cops are poets , but I know that all cops carry guns with triggers . And I know too how we are labeled . So in the name of Brother Clifton beware of the triggers ; go home , keep cool , stay safe away from the sun . Forget him . When he was alive he was our hope , but why worry over a hope that 's dead ? So there 's only one thing left to tell and I 've already told it . His name was Tod Clifton , he believed in Brotherhood , he aroused our hopes and he died . " I could n't go on . Below , they were waiting , hands and handkerchiefs shading their eyes . A preacher stepped up and read something out of his Bible , and I stood looking at the crowd with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from me , had been unable to bring in the political issues . And they stood there sun-beaten and sweatbathed , listening to me repeat what was known . Now the preacher had finished , and someone signaled the bandmaster and there was solemn music as the pallbearers carried the coffin down the spiraling stairs . The crowd stood still as we walked slowly through . I could feel the bigness of it and the unknownness of it and a pent-up tension  --  whether of tears or anger , I could n't tell . But as we walked through and down the hill to the hearse , I could feel it . The crowd sweated and throbbed , and though it was silent , there were many  | things directed toward me through its eyes . At the curb were the hearse and a few cars , and in a few minutes they were lauded and the crowd was still standing , looking on as we carried Tod Clifton away . And as I took one last look I saw not a crowd but the set faces of individual men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped moving there was a grave and we placed him in it . The gravediggers sweated heavily and knew their business and their brogue was Irish . They filled the grave quickly and we left . Tod Clifton was underground . I returned through the streets as tired as though I 'd dug the grave myself alone . I felt confused and listless moving through the crowds that seemed to boil along in a kind of mist , as though the thin humid clouds had thickened and settled directly above our heads . I wanted to go somewhere , to some cool place to rest without thinking , but there was still too much to be done ; plans had to be made ; the crowd 's emotion had to be organized . I crept along , walking a southern walk in southern weather , closing my eyes from time to time against the dazzling reds , yellows and greens of cheap sport shirts and summer dresses . The crowd boiled , sweated , heaved ; women with shopping bags , men with highly polished shoes . Even down South they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoed shines , " it rang in my head . In Eighth Avenue the market carts were parked hub to hub along the curb , improvised canopies shading the withering fruits and vegetables . I could smell the stench of decaying cabbage . A watermelon huckster stood in the shade beside his truck , holding up a long slice of orange-meated melon , crying his wares with hoarse appeals to nostalgia , memories of childhood , green shade and summer coolness . Oranges , cocoanuts and alligator pears lay in neat piles on little tables . I passed , winding my way through the slowly moving crowd . Stale and wilted flowers , rejected downtown , blazed feverishly on a cart , like glamorous rags festering ; beneath a futile spray from a punctured fruit juice can . The crowd were boiling figures seen through steaming glass from inside a washing machine ; and in the streets the mounted police detail stood looking on , their eyes " noncommittal beneath the short polished visors of their caps , their bodies slanting forward , reins slackly alert , men and horses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tod , I thought . The hucksters cried above the traffic sounds and I seemed to hear them from a distance , unsure of what they said . In a side  | street children with warped tricycles were parading along the walk carrying one of the signs , BROTHER TOD CLIFTON , OUR HOPE SHOT DOWN . And through the haze I again felt the tension . There was no denying it ; it was there and something had to be done before it simmered away in the heat .  | CHAPTER 22 WHEN I saw them sitting in their shirtsleeves , leaning forward , gripping their crossed knees with their hands , I was n't surprised . I 'm glad it 's you , I thought , this will be business without tears . It was as though I had expected to find them there , just as in those dreams in which I encountered my grandfather looking at me from across the dimensionless space of a dream-room . I looked back without surprise or emotion , although I knew even in the dream that surprise was the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrusted , a warning . I stood just inside the room , watching them as I slipped off my jacket , seeing them grouped around a small table upon which there rested a pitcher of water , a glass and a couple of smoking ash trays . One half of the room was dark and only one light burned , directly above the table . They regarded me silently , Brother Jack with a smile that went no deeper than his lips , his head cocked to one side , studying me with his penetrating eyes ; the others blank-faced , looking out of eyes that were meant to reveal nothing and to stir profound uncertainty . The smoke rose in spirals from their cigarettes as they sat perfectly contained , waiting . So you came , after all , I thought , going over and dropping into one of the chairs . I rested my arm on the table , noticing its coolness . " Well , how did it go ? " Brother Jack said , extending his clasped hands across the table and looking at me with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " We finally got them out . " " No , we did not see the crowd . How was it ? " " They were moved , " I said , " a great number of them . But beyond that I do n't know . They were with us , but how far I do n't  |  know ... " And for a moment I could hear my own voice in the quiet of the high-ceilinged hall . " S000 ! Is that all the great tactician has to tell us ? " Brother Tobitt said . " In what direction were they moved ? " I looked at him , aware of the numbness of my emotions ; they had flowed in one channel too long and too deeply . " That 's for the committee to decide . They were aroused , that was all we could do . We tried again and again to reach the committee for guidance but we could n't . " " So ? " " So we went ahead on my personal responsibility . " Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Your what ? " " My personal responsibility , " I said . " His personal responsibility , " Brother Jack said . " Did you hear that , Brothers ? Did I hear him correctly ? Where did you get it , Brother ? " he said . " This is astounding , where did you get it ? " " From your ma ? " I started and caught myself in time . " From the committee , " I said . There was a pause . I looked at him , his face reddening , as I tried to get my bearings . A nerve trembled in the center of my stomach . " Everyone came out , " I said , trying to fill it in . " We saw the opportunity and the community agreed with us . It 's too bad you missed it . . " You see , he 's sorry we missed it , " Brother Jack said . He held up his hand . I could see the deeply etched lines in his palm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does n't he see how I feel , I thought , ca n't he see why I did it ? What 's he trying to do ? Tobitt 's a fool , but why is he taking it up ? " You could have taken the next step , " I said , forcing the words . " We went as far as we could ... " " On your personal re-spon-si-bility , " Brother Jack said , bowing his head in time with the words . I looked at him steadily now . " I was told to win back our following , so I tried . The only way I knew how . What 's your criticism ? What 's wrong ? " " So now , " he said , rubbing his eye with a delicate circular movement of his fist , " the great tactician asks what 's wrong . Is it possible that something could be wrong ? Do you hear him , Brothers ? " There was a cough . Someone poured a glass of water and I could  | hear it fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final drops dripping from the pitcher-lip into the glass . I looked at him , my mind trying to bring things into focus . " You mean he admits the possibility of being incorrect ? " ' I'obitt said . " Sheer modesty , Brother . The sheerest modesty . We have here an extraordinary tactician , a Napoleon of strategy and personal responsibility . ' Strike while the iron is hot ' is his motto . Seize the instance by its throat , " Shoot at the whites of their eyes , " Give ' em the ax , the ax , the ax , ' and so forth . " I stood up . " I do n't know what this is all about , Brother . What are you trying to say ? " " Now there is a good question , Brothers . Sit down , please , it 's hot . He wants to know what we 're trying to say . We have here not only an extraordinary tactician , but one who has an appreciation for subtleties of expression . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " And for discipline ? Sit down , please , it 's hot . . . " " And for discipline . And for orders and consultation when it 's possible to have them , " I said . Brother Jack grinned . " Sit down , sit down ? And for patience ? " " When I 'm not sleepy and exhausted , " I said , " and not overheated as I am just now . " " You 'll learn , " he said . " You 'll learn and you 'll surrender yourself to it even under such conditions . Especially under such conditions ; that 's its value . That makes it patience . " " Yes , I guess I 'm learning now , " I said . " Right now . " " Brother , " he said drily , " you have no idea how much you 're learning ? Please sit down . " " All right , " I said , sitting down again . " But while ignoring my personal education for a second I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us these days . We could use this time more profitably . " " And I could tell you that politicians are not personal persons , " Brother Jack said , " but I wo n't . How could we use it more profit-ably ? " " By organizing their anger . " " So again our great tactician has relieved himself . Today he 's a busy man . First an oration over the body of Brutus , and now a lecture on the patience of the Negro people . "  | Tobitt was enjoying himself . I could see his cigarette tremble in his lips as he struck a match to light it . " I move we issue his remarks in a pamphlet , " he said , running his finger over his chin . " They should create a natural phenomenon . . . " This had better stop right here , I thought . My head was getting lighter and my chest felt tight . " Look , " I said , " an unarmed man was killed . A brother , a leading member shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community . I saw the chance to rally the people , so I acted . If that was incorrect , then I did wrong , so say it straight without this crap . It 'll take more than sarcasm to deal with that crowd out there . " Brother Jack reddened ; the others exchanged glances . " He has n't read the newspapers , " someone said . " You forget , " Brother Jack said , " it was n't necessary ; he was there . " " Yes , I was there , " I said . " If you 're referring to the killing . " " There , you see , " Brother Jack said . " He was on the scene . " Brother Tobitt pushed the table edge with his palms . " And still you organized that side show of a funeral ! " My nose twitched . I turned toward him deliberately , forcing a grin . " How could there be a side show without you as the star attraction ; who 'd draw the two bits admission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Now we 're making progress , " Brother Jack said , straddling his chair . " The strategist has raised a very interesting question . What 's wrong , he asks . All right , I 'll answer . Under your leadership , a traitorous merchant of vile instruments of anti-Negro , anti-minority racist bigotry has received the funeral of a hero . Do you still ask what 's wrong ? " " But nothing was done about a traitor , " I said . He half-stood , gripping the back of his chair . " We all heard you admit it . " . " We dramatized the shooting down of an unarmed black man . " He threw up his hands . To hell with you , I thought . To hell with you . He was a man ! " That black man , as you call him , was a traitor , " Brother Jack said . " A traitor ! " " What is a traitor , Brother ? " I asked , feeling an angry amusement  | as I counted on my fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tnan and brother ; a man and a traitor , as you say ; then he was a dead man , and alive or dead he was jam-full of contradictions . So full that he attracted half of Harlem to come out and stand in the sun in answcr to our call . So what is a traitor ? " " So now he retreats , " Brother Jack said . " Observe him , Brothers . After putting the movement in the position of forcing a traitor down the throats of the Negroes he asks what a traitor is . " " Yes , " I said . " Yes , and , as you say , it 's a fair question , Brother . Some folks call me traitor because I 've been working downtown ; some would call me a traitor if I was in Civil Service and others if I simply sat in my corner and kept quiet . Sure , I considered what Clifton did ? " " And you defend him ! " " Not for that . I was as disgusted as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unarmed man of more importance politically than the fact that he sold obscene dolls ? " " So you exercised your personal responsibility , " Jack said . " That 's all I had to go on . I was n't called to the strategy meeting , remember . " " Did n't you see what you were playing with ? " Tobitt said . " Have you no respect for your people ? " " It was a dangerous mistake to give you the opportunity , " one of the others said . I looked across at him . " The committee can take it away , if it wishes . But meantime , why is everyone so upset ? If even one-tenth of the people looked at the dolls as we do , our work would be a lot easier . The dolls are nothing . " " Nothing , " Jack said . " That nothing that might explode in our face . " I sighed . " Your faces are safe , Brother , " I said . " Ca n't you see that they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the new program would n't have flopped . The Brotherhood is n't the Negro people ; no organization is . All you see in Clifton 's death is that it might harm the prestige of the Brotherhood . You see him only as a traitor . But Harlem does n't react that way . " " Now he 's lecturing us on the conditioned reflexes of the Negro people , " Tobitt said . I looked at him . I was very tired . " And what is the source of your great contributions to the movement , Brother ? A career in burlesque ?  | And of your profound knowledge of Negroes ? Are you from an old plantation-owning family ? Does your black mammy shuffle nightly through your dreams ? " He opened his mouth and closed it like a fish . " I 'll have you know that I 'm married to a fine , intelligent Negro girl , " he said . So that 's what makes you so cocky , I thought , seeing now how the light struck him at an angle and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . . . and how did I guess there was a woman in it ? " Brother , I apologize , " I said . " I misjudged you . You have our number . In fact , you must be practically a Negro yourself . Was it by immersion or injection ? " " Now see here , " he said , pushing back his chair . Come on , I thought , just make a move . Just another little move . " Brothers , " Jack said , his eyes on me . " Let 's stick to the discussion . I 'm intrigued . You were saying ? " I watched Tobitt . He glared . I grinned . " I was saying that up here we know that the policemen did n't care about Clifton 's ideas . He was shot because he was black and because he resisted . Mainly because he was black . " Brother Jack frowned . " You 're riding race ' again . But how do they feel about the dolls ? " " I 'm riding the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And as for the dolls , they know that as far as the cops were concerned Clifton could have been selling song sheets . Bibles , matzos . If he 'd been white , he 'd be alive . Or if he 'd accepted being pushed around . . . " " Black and white , white and black , " Tobitt said . " Must we listen to this racist nonsense ? " " You do n't , Brother Negro , " I said . " You get your own information straight from the source . Is it a mulatto source , Brother ? Do n't answer  --  the only thing wrong is that your source is too narrow . You do n't really think that crowd turned out today because Clifton was a member of the Brotherhood ? " " And why did they turn out ? " Jack said , getting set as if to pounce forward . " Because we gave them the opportunity to express their feelings , to affirm themselves . " Brother Jack rubbed his eye . " Do you know that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You astound me . " " I doubt that , Brother , but there 's nothing like isolating a man to make him think , " I said .  | " Yes , that 's true ; some of our best ideas have been thought in prison . Only , you have n't been in prison , Brother , and you were not hired to think . Had you forgotten that ? If so , listen to me : You were not hired to think . " He was speaking very deliberately and I thought , So . . . So here it is , naked and old and rotten . So now it 's out in the open .. . " So now I know where I am , " I said , " and with whom ? " " Do n't twist my meaning . For all of us , the committee does the thinking . For all of us . And you were hired to talk . " " That 's right , I was hired . Things have been so brotherly I had forgotten my place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We furnish all ideas . We have some acute ones . Ideas are part of our apparatus . Only the correct ideas for the correct occasion . " " And suppose you misjudge the occasion ? " " Should that ever happen , you keep quiet . " " Even though I am correct ? " " You say nothing unless it is passed by the committee . Otherwise I suggest you keep saying the last thing you were told . " " And when my people demand that I speak ? " " The committee will have an answer ! " I looked at him . The room was hot , quiet , smoky . The others looked at me strangely . I heard the nervous sound of someone mashing out a cigarette in a glass ash tray . I pushed back my chair , breathing deeply , controlled . I was on a dangerous road and I thought of Clifton and tried to get off of it . I said nothing . Suddenly Jack smiled and slipped back into his fatherly role . " Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " We are experienced . We 're graduates and while you are a smart beginner you skipped several grades . But they were important grades , especially for gaining strategical knowledge . For such it is necessary to see the overall picture . More is involved than meets the eye . With the long view and the short view and the overall view mastered , perhaps you wo n't slander the political consciousness of the people of Harlem . " Ca n't he see I 'm trying to tell them what 's real , I thought . Does my membership stop me from feeling Harlem ? " All right , " I said . " Have it your way , Brother ; only the political consciousness of Harlem is exactly a thing I know something about . That 's one class they would n't let me skip . I 'm describing a part of reality which I know . " " And that is the most questionable statement of all , " Tobitt said .  | " I know , " I said , running my thumb along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you differently . History 's made at night , eh , Brother ? " " I 've warned you , " Tobitt said . " Brother to brother , Brother , " I said , " try getting around more . You might learn that today was the first time that they 've listened to our appeals in weeks . And I 'll tell you something else : If we do n't follow through on what was done today , this might be the last . . . " " So , he 's finally gotten around to predicting the future , " Brother Jack said . " It 's possible . . . though I hope not . " " He 's in touch with God , " Tobitt said , " The black God . " I looked at him and grinned . He had gray eyes and his irises were very wide , the muscles ridged out on his jaws . I had his guard down and he was swinging wild . " Not with God , nor with your wife , Brother , " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've worked among the people up here . Ask your wife to_the take you around to the gin mills and the barber shops and the juke joints and the churches , Brother . Yes , and the beauty parlors on Saturdays when they 're frying hair . A whole unrecorded history is , spoken then , Brother . You would n't believe it but it 's true . Tell her to take you to stand in the areaway of a cheap tenement at night and listen to what is said . Put her out on the corner , let her tell you what 's being put down . You 'll learn that a lot of people are angry because we failed to lead them in action . I 'll stand on that as I stand on what I see and feel and on what I 've heard , and what I know . " " No , " Brother Jack said , getting to his feet , " you 'll stand on the decision of the committee . We 've had enough of this . The committee makes your decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance to the mistaken notions of the people . What 's happened to your discipline ? " " I 'm not arguing against discipline . I 'm trying to be useful . I 'm trying to point out a part of reality which the committee seems to have missed . With just one demonstration we could ? " " The committee has decided against such demonstrations , " Brother Jack said . " Such methods are no longer effective . " Something seemed to move out from under me , and out of the corner of my eye I was suddenly aware of objects on the dark side of the hall . " But did n't anyone see what happened today ? " I said . " What was that , a dream ? What was ineffective about that crowd ? "  | " Such crowds are only our raw materials , one of the raw materials to be shaped to our program . " I looked around the table and shook my head . " No wonder they insult me and accuse us of betraying them . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brother Jack shouted , stepping forward . " It 's true , I 'll repeat it . Until this afternoon they 've been saying that the Brotherhood betrayed them . I 'm telling you what 's been said to me , and that is why Brother Clifton disappeared . " " That 's an indefensible lie , " Brother Jack said . And I looked at him slowly now , thinking , If this is it , this is it . .. " Do n't call me that , " I said softly . " Do n't ever call me that , none of you . I 've told you what I 've heard . " My hand was in my pocket now , Brother Tarp 's leg chain around my knuckles . I looked at each of them individually , trying to hold myself back and yet feeling it getting away from me . My head was whirling as though I were riding a supersonic merry-go-round . Jack looked at me , a new interest behind his eyes , leaned forward . " So you 've heard it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear this : We do not shape our policies to the mistaken and infantile notions of the man in the street . Our job is not to ask them what they think but to tell them ! " " You 've said that , " I said , " and that 's one thing you can tell them yourself . Who are you , anyway , the great white father ? " " Not their father , their leader . And your leader . And do n't forget it . " " My leader sure , but what 's your exact relationship to them ? " His red head bristled . " The leader . As leader of the Brotherhood , I am their leader . " " But are you sure you are n't their great white father ? " I said , watching him closely , aware of the hot silence and feeling tension race from my toes to my legs as I drew my feet quickly beneath me . " Would n't it be better if they called you Marse Jack ? " " Now see here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the table , and I spun my chair half around on its hind legs as he came between me and the light , gripping the edge of the table , spluttering and lapsing into a foreign language , choking and coughing and shaking his head as I balanced on my toes now , set to propel tnyself forward ; seeing him above me and the others behind him as suddenly something seemed to erupt out of his face . You 're seeing things , I thought , hearing it strike sharply against the table and roll as his  | arm shot out and snatched an object the size of a large marble and dropped it , plop ! into his glass , and I could see the water shooting up in a ragged , light-breaking pattern to spring in swift droplets across the oiled table top . The room seemed to flatten . I shot to a high plateau above them and down , feeling the jolt on the end of my spine as the chair legs struck the floor . The merry-go-round had speeded up , I heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , seeing how the light shone through , throwing a transparent , precisely fluted shadow against the dark grain of the table , and there on the bottom of the glass lay an eye . A glass eye . A buttermilk white eye distorted by the light rays . An eye staring fixedly at me as from the dark waters of a well . Then I was looking at him standing above me , outlined by the light against the darkened half of the hall . " . .. You must accept discipline . Either you accept decisions or you get out ... ' I stared into his face , feeling a sense of outrage . His left eye had collapsed , a line of raw redness showing where the lid refused to close , and his gaze had lost its command . I looked from his face to the glass , thinking , he 's disemboweled himself just in order to confound me . . . And the others had known it all along . They are n't even surprised . I stared at the eye , aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you following me ? " He stopped , squinting at me with Cyclopean irritation , " What is the matter ? " I stared up at him , unable to answer . Then he understood and approached the table , smiling maliciously . " So that 's it . So it makes you uncomfortable , does it ? You 're a sentimentalist , " he said , sweeping up the glass and causing the eye to turn over in the water so that now it seemed to peer down at me from the ringed bottom of the glass . He smiled , holding the tumbler level with his empty socket , swirling the glass . " You did n't know about this ? " " No , and I did n't want to know . " Someone laughed . " See , that demonstrates how long you 've been with us . " He lowered the glass . " I lost my eye ' in the line of duty . What do you think of that ? " he said with a pride that made me all the angrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost it as long as you keep it hidden . " " That is because you do n't appreciate the meaning of sacrifice . I  | was ordered to carry through an objective and I carried it through . Understand ? Even though I had to lose my eye to do it . . . " He was gloating now , holding up the eye in the glass as though it were a medal of merit . " Not much like that traitor Clifton , is it ? " Tobitt said . The others were amused . " All right , " I said . " All right ! It was a heroic act . It saved the world , now hide the bleeding wound ! " " Do n't overevaluate it , " Jack said , quieter now . " The heroes are those who die . This was nothing  --  after it happened . A minor lesson in discipline . And do you know what discipline is , Brother Personal Responsibility ? It 's sacrifice , saca.if ce , SACPJFtcr : ! " He slammed the glass upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . I shook like a leaf . So that is the meaning of discipline , I thought , sacrifice . . . yes , and blindness ; he dogsn t see rnw . U , e .. es n't even see me . Am I about to strangle him ? I do not know . He can not possibly . I still do not know . See ! Discipline is sacrifice . Yes , and blindness . Yes . And me sitting here while he tries to intimidate me . That 's it , with his goddam blind glass eye . . . Should you show him you get it ? Should n't you ? Should n't he know it ? Hurry ! Should n't you ? Look at it there , a good job , an almost perfect imitation that seemed alive . . . Should you , should n't you ? Maybe he got it where he learned that language he lapsed into . Should n't you ? Make him speak the unknown tongue , the language of the future . What 's mattering with you ? Discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I stand ? You 're sitting here , ai n't I ? You 're holding on , ai n't I ? He said you 'd learn so you 're learning , so he saw it all the time . He 's a riddler , should n't we show him ? So sit still is the way , and learn , never mind the eye , it 's dead . . . All right now , look at him , see him turning now , left , right , coming short-legged toward you . See him , hep ! hep ! the one-eyed beacon . All right , all right . . . Hep , hep ! The short-legged deacon . All right ! Nail him ! The shortchanging dialectical deacon . . . All right . There , so now you 're learning . . . Get it under control . . . Patience . . . Yes . . . I looked at him again as for the first time , seeing a little bantam rooster of a man with a high-domed forehead and ) a raw eye-socket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him carefully now with some of the red spots fading and with the feeling that I was just awakening from a dream . I had boomeranged around . " I realize how you feel , " he said , becoming an actor who 'd just  | finished a part in a play and was speaking again in his natural voice . " I remember the first time I saw myself this way and it was n't pleasant . And do n't think I would n't rather have my old one back . " He felt in the water for his eye now , and I could see its smooth halfspherical , half-amorphous form slip between his two fingers and spurt around the glass as though looking for a way to break out . Then he had it , shaking off the water and breathing upon it as he walked across to the dark side of the room . " But who knows , Brothers , " he said , with his back turned , " perhaps if we do our work successfully the new society will provide me with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all fantastic , although I 've been with ( mine for quite a while ... What time is it , by the way ? " But what , . Ind of society will make him see me , I thought , hearing Tobitt answer , " Six-fifteen . " " Then we 'd better leave immediately , we 've got a long way to travel , " he said , coming across the floor . He had his eye in place now and he was smiling . " How 's that ? " he asked me . I nodded , I was very tired . I simply nodded . " Good , " he said . " I sincerely hope it never happens to you . Sincerely . " " If it should , maybe you 'll recommend me to your oculist , " I said , " then I may not-see myself as others see-me-not . " He looked at me oddly then laughed . " See , Brothers , he 's joking . He feels brotherly again . But just the same , I hope you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hambro . He 'll outline the program and give you the instructions . As for today , just let things float . It is a development that is important only if we make it so . Otherwise it will be forgotten , " he said , getting into his jacket . " And you 'll see that it 's best . The Brotherhood must act as a co-ordinated unit . " I looked at him . I was becoming aware of smells again and I needed a bath . The others were standing now and moving toward the door . I stood up , feeling the shirt sticking to my back . " One last thing , " Jack said , placing his hand on my shoulder and speaking quietly . ' Watch that temper , that 's discipline , too . Learn to demolish your brotherly opponents with ideas , with polemical skill . The other is for our enemies . Save it for them . And go get some rest . " I was beginning to tremble . His face seemed to advance and recede , recede and advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know how you feel , " he said . " And it 's too bad all that effort was for nothing . But that in itself is a kind of discipline . I speak to you of what I have learned and I 'm a great deal older than you . Good night . " I looked at his eye . So he knows how I feel . Which eye is really the blind one ? ' Good night , " I said . " Good night , Brother , " they all except Tobitt said . It 'll be night , but it wo n't be good , I thought , calling a final " Good night . " They left and I took my jacket and went and sat at my desk . I heard them passing down the stairs and the closing of the door below . I felt as though I 'd been watching a bad comedy . Only it was real and'I was living it and it was the only historically meaningful life that I could live . If I left it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningless as Clifton . I felt for the doll in the shadow and dropped it on the desk . He was did all right , and nothing would come of his death now . He was useless even for a scavenger action . He had waited too long , the directives had changed on him . He 'd barely gotten by with a funeral . And that was all . It was only a matter of a few days , but he had missed and there was nothing I could do . But at least he was dead and out of it . I sat there a while , growing wilder and fighting against it . I could n't leave and I had to keep contact in order to fight . But I would never be the same . Never . After tonight I would n't ever look the same , or feel the same . Just what I 'd be , I did n't know ; I could n't go back to what I was  --  which was n't much  --  but I 'd lost too much to be what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died with Tod Clifton . So I would see Hambro , for whatever it was worth . I got up and went out into the hall . The glass was still on the table and I swept it across the room , hearing it rumble and roll in the dark . Then I went downstairs .  | CHAPTER 19 THE BAR downstairs was hot and crowded and there was a heated argument in progress over Clifton 's shooting . I stood near the door and ordered a bourbon . Then someone noticed me , and they tried to draw me in . " Please , not tonight , " I said . " He was one of my best friends . " " Oh , sure , " they said , and I had another bourbon and left . When I reached 125th Street , I was approached by a group of civil-liberties workers circulating a petition demanding the dismissal of the guilty policeman , and a block further on even the familiar woman street preacher was shouting a sermon about the slaughter of the innocents . A much broader group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good , I thought , perhaps it wo n't die down after all . Maybe I 'd better see Hambro tonight . Little groups were all along the street , and I moved with increasing speed until suddenly I had reached Seventh Avenue , and there beneath a street lamp with the largest crowd around him was Ras the Exhorter  --  the last man in the world I wanted to see . And I had just turned back when I saw him lean down between his flags , shouting , " Look , look , Black ladies and gentlemahn ! There goes the representative of the Brotherhood . Does Ras see correctly ? Is that gentlemahn trying to pass us unnoticed ? Ask him about it . What are you people waiting for , sir ? What are you doing about our black youth shot down beca'se of your deceitful organization ? " They turned , looking at me , closing in . Some came up behind me and tried to push me further into the crowd . The Exhorter leaned down , pointing at me , beneath the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , ladies and gentlemahn.  | Are they afraid  --  or are the white folks and their black stooges sticking together to betray us ? " " Get your hands off me , " I shouted as someone reached around and seized my arm . I heard a voice cursing me softly . " Give the brother a chance to answer ! " someone said . Their faces pressed in upon me . I wanted to laugh , for suddenly I realized that I did n't know whether I had been part of a sellout or not . But they were in no mood for laughter . " Ladies ands gentlemen , brothers and sisters , " I said , " I disdain to answer such an attack . Since you all know me and my work , I do n't think it 's necessary . But it seems highly dishonorable to use the unfortunate death of one of our most promising young men as an excuse for attacking an organization that has worked to bring an end to such outrages . Who was the first organization to act against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arouse the people ? The Brotherhood ! Who will always be the first to advance the cause of the people ? Again the Brotherhood ! " We acted and we shall always act , I assure you . But in our own disciplined way . And we 'll act positively . We refuse to waste our energies and yours in premature and ill-considered actions . We are Americans , all of us , whether black or white , regardless of what the man on the ladder there tells you , Americans . And we leave it to the gentleman up there to abuse the name of the dead . The Brotherhood grieves and feels deeply the loss of its brother . And we are determined that his death shall be the beginning of profound and lasting changes . It 's easy enough to wait around for the minute a man is safely buried and then stand on a ladder and smear the memory of everything he believed in . But to create something lasting of his death takes time and careful planning ? " " Gentlemahn , " Ras shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering my question . What are you doing about the shooting ? " I moved toward the edge of the crowd . If this went any further , it could be disastrous . " Stop abusing the dead for your own selfish ends , " I said . " Let him rest in peace . Quit mangling his corpse ! " I pushed away as he raged , hearing shouts of , " Tell him about it ! " " Grave robber ! " The Exhorter waved his arms and pointed , shouting , " That mahn is a paid stooge of the white enslaver ! Wheere has he been for the  | last few months when our black babies and women have been suffer-ing " Let the dead rest in peace , " I shouted , hearing someone call " Aw man , go back to Africa . Everybody knows the brother . " Good , I thought , good . Then there was a scuffle behind me and I whirled to see two men stop short . They were Ras 's men . " Listen , mister , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's good for you , you 'll call off your goons . Two of them seem to want to follow me . " " And that is a dahm lie ! " he shouted . " There are witnesses if anything should happen to me . A man who 'll dig up the dead hardly before he 's buried will try anything , but I warn you ? " There were angry shouts from some of the crowd and I saw the men continue past me with hate in their eyes , leaving the crowd to disappear around the corner . Ras was attacking the Brotherhood now and others were answering him from the audience , and I went on , moving back toward Lenox , moving past a movie house when they grabbed me and started punching . But this time they 'd picked the wrong spot , and the movie doorman intervened and they ran back toward Ras 's street meeting . I thanked the doorman and went on . I had been lucky ; they had n't hurt me , but Ras was becoming bold again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . Reaching the Avenue I stepped to the curb and signaled a cab , seeing it sail by . An ambulance went past , then another cab with its flag down . I looked back . I felt that they were watching me from somewhere up the street but I could n't see them . Why did n't a taxi come ! Then three men in natty cream-colored summer suits came to stand near me at the curb , and something about them struck me like a hammer . They were all wearing dark glasses . I had seen it thousands of times , but suddenly what I had considered an empty imitation of a Hollywood fad was flooded with personal significance . Why not , I thought , why not , and shot across the street and into the air-conditioned chill of a drugstore . I saw them on a case strewn with sun visors , hair nets , rubber gloves , a card of false eyelashes , and seized the darkest lenses I could find . They were of a green glass so dark that it appeared black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness and moving outside . I could barely see ; it was almost dark now , and the streets swarmed in a green vagueness . I moved slowLv across to stand near the subway  | and wait for my eyes to adjust . A strange wave of excitement boiled within me as I peered out at the sinister light . And now through the hot gusts from the underground people were emerging and I ( mild feel the trains vibrating the walk . A cab rolled up to discharge a passenger and I was about to take it when the woman came up the stairs and stopped before me , smiling . Now what , I thought , seeing her standing there , smiling in her tight-fitting summer dress ; a large young woman who reeked with Christmas Night perfume who now came close . " Rinehart , baby , is that you ? " she said . Rinehart , I thought . So it works . She had her hand on my arm and faster than I thought I heard myself answer , " Is that you , baby ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for once you 're on time , " she said . " But what you doing bareheaded , where 's your new hat I bought you ? " I wanted to laugh . The scent of Christmas Night was enfolding me now and I saw her face draw closer , her eyes widening . " Say , you ai n't Rinehart , man . What you trying to do ? You do n't even talk like Rine . What 's your story ? " I laughed , backing away . " I guess we were both mistaken , " I said . She stepped backward clutching her bag , watching me , confused . " I really meant no harm , " I said . " I 'm sorry . Who was it you mistook me for ? " " Rinehart , and you 'd better not let him catch you pretending to be him . " " No , " I said . " But you seemed so pleased to see him that I could n't resist it . He 's really a lucky man . " " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from here before you get me in trouble , " she said , moving aside , and I left . It was very strange . But that about the hat was a good idea , I thought , hurrying along now and looking out for Ras 's men . 1 was wasting time . At the first hat shop I went in and bought the widest hat in'stock and put it on . With this , I thought , I should be seen even in a snowstorm  --  only they 'd think I was someone else . Then I was back in the street and moving toward the subway . My eyes adjusted quickly ; the world took on a dark-green intensity , the lights of cars glowed like stars , faces were a mysterious blur ; the garish signs of movie houses muted down to a soft sinister glowing . I headed back for Ras 's meeting with a bold swagger . This was the real test , if it worked I would go on to Hambro 's without further trouble . In the angry period to come I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men approached , eating up the walk with long jaunty strides that caused their heavy silk sport shirts to flounce rhythmically upon their bodies . They too wore dark glasses , their hats were set high upon their heads , the brims turned down . A couple of hipsters , I thought , just as they spoke . " What you sayin ' , daddy-o , " they said . " Rinehart , poppa , tell us what you putting down , " they said . Oh , hell , they 're probably his friends , I thought , waving and moving on . " We know what you 're doing , Rinehart , " one of them called . " Play it cool , ole man , play it cool ! " I waved again as though in on the joke . They laughed behind me . I was nearing the end of the block now , wet with sweat . Who was this Rinehart and what was he putting down ? I 'd have to learn more about him to avoid further misidentifications .. . A car passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exhorter barking harshly to the crowd . Then I was moving close , and coming to a stop conspicuously in the space left for pedestrians to pass through the crowd . To the rear they were lined up two deep before the store windows . Before me the listeners merged in a greentinted gloom . The Exhorter gestured violently , blasting the Brotherhood . " The time for ahction is here . We mahst chase them out of Harlem , " he cried . And for a second I thought he had caught me in the sweep of his eyes , and tensed . " Ras said chase them ! It is time Ras the Exhorter become Ras the DESTROYER ! " Shouts of agreement arose and I looked behind me , seeing the men who had followed me and thinking , What did he mean , de-stroyer ? " I repeat , black ladies and gentlemahn , the time has come for ahction ! I , Ras the Destroyer , repeat , the time has come ! " I trembled with excitement ; they had n't recognized me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not me . There is a magic in it . It hides me right in front of their eyes . . . But suddenly I was n't sure . With Ras calling for the destruction of everything white in Harlem , who could notice me ? I needed a better test . If I was to carry ont my plan . . . What plan ? Hell , I do n't know , come on . . . I weaved out of the crowd and left , heading for Hambro 's . A group of zoot-suiters greeted me in passing . " Hey now , daddy-o , " they called . " Hey now ! "  | " Hey now ! " I said . It was as though by dressing and walking in a certain way I had enlisted in a fraternity in which I was recognized at a glance not by features , but by clothes , by uniform , by gait . But this gave rise to another uncertainty . I was not a zoot-suiter , but a kind of politician . Or was I ? What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd been so insulting at the Jolly Dollar ? I was halfway across Eighth Avenue at the thought and retraced my steps , running for an uptown bus . There were many of the regular customers draped around the bar . The room was crowded and Barrelhouse was on duty . I could feel the frame of the glasses cutting into the ridge of my nose as I tilted my hat and squeezed up to the bar . Barrelhouse looked at me roughly , his lips pushed out . " What brand you drinking tonight , Poppa-stopper ? " he said . " Make it Ballantine 's , " I said in my natural voice . I watched his eyes as he set the beer before me and slapped the bar with his enormous hand for his money . Then , my heart beating faster , I made my old gesture of payment , spinning the coin upon the bar and waited . The coin disappeared into his fist . " Thanks , pops , " he said , moving on and leaving me puzzled . For there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Ile never called me " pops " or " poppa-stopper . " It 's working , I thought , perhaps it 's working very well . Certainly something was working on me , and profoundly . Still I was relieved . It was hot . Perhaps that was it . I drank the cold beer , looking back to the rear of the room to the booths . A crowd of men and women moiled like nightmare figures in the smoke-green haze . The juke box was dinning and it was like looking into the depths of a murky cave . And now someone moved aside and looking down along the curve of the bar past the bobbing heads and shoulders I saw the juke box , lit up like a bad dream of the Fiery Furnace , shouting : Jelly , Jelly Jelly , All night long . And yet , I thought , watching a numbers runner paying off a bet , this is one place that the Brotherhood definitely penetrated . Let Hambro explain that , too , along with all the rest he 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , when there across a t the  | lunch counter I saw Brother Maceo . I moved impulsively , forgetting my disguise until almost upon him , then checked myself and put my disguise once more to a test . Reaching roughly across his shoulder I picked up a greasy menu that rested between the sugar shaker and l the hot-sauce bottle and pretended to read it through my dark lenses . " How 're the ribs , pops ? " I said . " Fine , least these here I 'm eatin ' is . " " Yeah ? How much you know about ribs ? " He raised his head slowly , looking across at the spitted chickens revolving before the low blue rotisserie flames . " I reckon I know as much about ' em as you , " he said , " and probably more , since I probably been eatin " em a few years longer than you , and in a few more places . What makes you think you kin come in here messing with me anyhow ? " He turned , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very game and I wanted to laugh . " Oh , take it easy , " I growled . " A man can ask a question , ca n't he ? " " You got your answer , " he said , turning completely around on the stool . " So now I guess you ready to pull your knife . " " Knife ? " I said , wanting to laugh . " Who said anything about a knife ? " " That 's what you thinking about . Somebody say something you do n't like and you kinda fellows pull your switch blades . So all right , go ahead and pull it . I 'm as ready to die as I 'm gon ' ever be . Let 's see you , go ahead ! " He reached for the sugar shaker now , and I stood there feeling suddenly that the old man before me was not Brother Maceo at all , but someone else disguised to confuse me . The glasses were working too well . He 's a game old brother , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plate . " I asked you about the ribs , " I said , " not your ribs . Who said anything about a knife ? " " Never mind that , just go on and pull it , " he said . " Let 's see you . Or is you waiting for me to turn my back . All right , here it is , here 's my back , " he said , turning swiftly on the stool and around again , his arm set to throw the shaker . Customers were turning to look , were moving clear . " What 's the matter , Maceo ? " someone said . " Nothing I caint handle ; this confidencing sonofabitch come in here bluffing ? "  | " You take it easy , old man , " I said . " Do n't let your mouth get your head in trouble , " thinking , Why am I talking like this ? " You do n't have to worry about that , sonofabitch , pull your switch blade ! " " Give it to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of the voice by ear now , turning so that I could see Maceo , the agitator , and the customers blocking the door . Even the juke box had stopped and I could feel the danger mounting so swiftly that I moved without thinking , bounding over quickly and sweeping up a beer bottle , my body trembling . " All right , " I said , " if that 's the way you want it , all right ! The next one who talks out of turn gets this ! " Maceo moved and I feinted with the bottle , seeing him dodge , his arm set to throw and held only because I was crowding him ; a dark old man in overalls and a gray long-billed cloth cap , who looked dreamlike through the green glasses . " Throw it , " I said . " Go on , " overcome with the madness of the thing . Here I 'd set out to test a disguise on a friend and now I was ready to beat him to his knees  --  not because I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay , it was absurd and yet real and dangerous and if he moved , I 'd let him have it as brutally as possible . To protect myself I 'd have to , or the drunks would gang me . Macco was set , looking at me coldly , and suddenly I heard a voice boom out , " Ai n't going to be no fighting in my joint ! " It was Barrelhouse . " Put them things down y'all , they cost money . " " Hell , Barrelhouse , let ' em fight ! " " They can fight in the streets , not in here ? Hey , y'all , " he called , " look over here . . . " I saw him now , leaning forward with a pistol in his huge fist , resting it steady upon the bar . " Now put ' em down y'all , " he said mournfully . " I done ask you to put my property down . " Brother Maceo looked from me to Barrelhouse . " Put it down , old man , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride when this is not really me ? " You put yourn down , " he said . " Both of y'all put ' em down ; and you , Rinehart , " Barrelhouse said , gesturing at me with the pistol , " you get out of my joint and stay out . We do n't need your money in here . " I started to protest , but he held up his palm .  | " Now you all right with me , Rinehart , do n't get me wrong . But I just ca n't stand trouble , " Barrelhouse said . Brother Maceo had replaced the shaker now and I put my bottle down and backed to the door . " And Rine , " Barrelhouse said , " do n't go try to pull no pistol neither , ' cause this here one is loaded and I got a permit . " I backed to the door , my scalp prickling , watching them both . " Next time do n't ask no questions you do n't want answered , " Maceo called . " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right here . " I felt the outside air explode around me and I stood just beyond the door laughing with the sudden relief of the joke restored , looking back at the defiant old man in his long-billed cap and the confounded eyes of the crowd . Rinehart , Rinehart , I thought , what kind of man is Rinehart ? I was still chuckling when , in the next block , I waited for the traffic lights near a group of men who stood on the corner passing a bottle of cheap wine between them as they discussed Clifton 's murder . " What we need is some guns , " one of them said . " An eye for an eye . " " Hell yes , machine guns . Pass me the sneakypete , Muckleroy . " " Was n't for that Sullivan Law this here New York would n't be nothing but a shooting gallery , " another man said . " Here 's the sneakypete , and do n't try to find no home in that bottle . " " It 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that away from me ? " " Man , drink up and pass the damn bottle . " I started around them , hearing one of them say , " What you saying , Mr. Rinehart , how 's your hammer hanging ? " Even up here , I thought , beginning to hurry . " Heavy , man , " I said , knowing the answer to that one , " very heavy . " They laughed . " Well , it 'll be lighter by morning . " " Say , look ahere , Mr. Rinehart , how about giving me a job ? " one of them said , approaching me , and I waved and crossed the street , walking rapidly down Eighth toward the next bus stop . The shops and groceries were dark now , and children were running and yelling along the walks , dodging in and out among the  | adults . I walked , struck by the merging fluidity of forms seen through the lenses . Could this be the way the world appeared to Rinehart ? All the dark-glass boys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then ? but then ? " I could n't remember the rest . She was carrying a shopping bag and moved gingerly on her feet . Until she touched my arm I thought that she was talking to herself . " I say , pardon me , son , look like you trying to pass on by me tonight . What 's the final figger ? " " Figure ? What figure ? " " Now you know what I mean , " she said , her voice rising as she put her hands on her hips and looked forward . " I mean today 's last number . Ai n't you Rine the runner ? " " Rine the runner ? " " Yas , Rinehart the number man . Who you trying to fool ? " " But that 's not my name , madame , " I said , speaking as precisely as I could and stepping away from her . " You 've made a mistake . " Her mouth fell wide . " You ai n't ? Well , why you look so much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , ai n't this here something . Let me get on home ; if my dream come out , I'm-a have to go look that rascal up . And here I needs that money too . " " I hope you won , " I said , straining to see her clearly , " and I hope he pays off . " " Thanks , son , but he 'll pay off all right . I can see you ai n't Rinehart now though . I 'm sorry for stopping you . " " It 's all right , " I said . " If I 'd looked at your shoes I woulda known ? " " Why ? " " ' Cause Rine the runner is known for them knobtoed kind . " I watched her limp away , rocking like the Old Ship of Zion . No wonder everyone knows him , I thought , in that racket you have to get around . I was aware of my black-and-white shoes for the first time since the day of Clifton 's shooting . When the squad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me I knew what was coming before the cop opened his mouth . " That you , Rinehart , my man ? " the cop who-was not driving said . He was white . I could see the shield gleaming on his cap but the number was vague . " Not this time , officer , " I said . " The hell you say ; what 're you trying to pull ? Is this a holdout ? "  | " You 're making a mistake , " I said . " I 'm not Rinehart . " The car stopped , a flashlight beamed in my green-lensed eyes . He spat into the street . " Well , you better be by morning , " he said , " and you better have our cut in the regular place . Who the hell you think you are ? " he called as the car speeded up and away . And before I could turn a crowd of men ran up from the corner pool hall . One of them carried an automatic in his hand . " What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It was nothing , they thought I was someone else . " " Who 'd they take you for ? " I looked at them  --  were they criminals or simply men who were worked up over the shooting ? " Some guy named Rinehart , " I said . " Rinehart ? Hey , y'all hear that ? " snorted the fellow with the gun . " Rinehart ! Them paddies must be going stone blind . Anybody can see you ai n't Rinehart . " " But he do look like Rine , " another man said , staring at me with his hands in his trousers pockets . " Like hell he does . " " Hell , man , Rinehart would be driving that Cadillac this time of night . What the hell you talking about ? " " Listen , Jack , " the fellow with the gun said , " do n't let nobody make you act like Rinehart . You got to have a smooth tongue , a heartless heart and be ready to do anything . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We aim to stop some of this headwhupping they been doing . " " Sure , " I said . " Rinehart , " he said again . " Ai n't that a bitch ? " They turned and went arguing back to the pool hall and I hurried out of the neighborhood . Having forgotten Hambro for the moment I walked east instead of west . I wanted to remove the glasses but decided against it . Ras 's men might still be on the prowl . It was quieter now . No one paid me any special attention , although the street was alive with pedestrians , all moiling along in the mysterious tint of green . Perhaps I 'm out of his territory at last , I thought and began trying to place Rinehart in the scheme of things . He 's been around all the while , but I have been looking in another direction . He was around and others like him , but I had looked past him  | until Clifton 's death ( or was it Ras ? ) had made me aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? If dark glasses and a white hat could blot out my identity so quickly , who actually wa7 who ? The perfume was exotic and seemed to roll up the walk behind me as I became aware of a woman strolling casually behind me . " I 've been waiting for you to recognize me , daddy , " a voice said . " I 've been waiting for you a long time . " It was a pleasant voice with a slightly husky edge and plenty of sleep in it . " Do n't you hear me , daddy ? " she said . And I started to look around , hearing , " No , daddy , do n't look back ; my old man might be cold trailing me . Just walk along beside me while I tell you where to meet me . I swear I thought you 'd never come . Will you be able to see me tonight ? " She had moved close to me now and suddenly I felt a hand fumbling at my jacket pocket . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , here it is ; now will you see me ? " I stopped dead , grabbing her hand and looking at her , an exotic girl even through the green glasses , looking at me with a smile that suddenly broke . " Rinehart , daddy , what 's the matter ? " So here it goes again , I thought , holding her tightly . " I 'm not Rinehart , Miss , " I said . " And for the first time tonight I 'm truly sorry . " " But Bliss , daddy  --  Rinehart ! You 're not trying to put your baby down ? Daddy , what did I do ? " She seized my arm and we were poised face to face in the middle of the walk . And suddenly she screamed , " O000000h ! You really are n't ! And me trying to give you his money . Get away from me , you dumb John . Get away from me ! " I backed off . Her face was distorted as she stamped her high heels and screamed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was that ? " followed by the sound of running feet as I shot off and around the corner away from her screams . That lovely girl , I thought , that lovely girl . - Several blocks away I stopped , out of breath . And both pleased and angry . How stupid could people be ? Was everyone suddenly nuts ? I looked about me . It was a bright street , the walks full of  | people . I stood at the curb trying to breathe . Up the street a sign with a cross glowed above the walk : HOLY WAY STATION BEHOLD THE LIVING GOD The letters glowed dark green and I wondered if it were from the lenses or the actual color of the neon tubes . A couple of drunks stumbled past . I headed for Hambro 's , passing a man sitting on the curb with his head bent over his knees . Cars passed . I went on . Two solemn-faced children came passing out handbills which first I refused , then went back and took . After all , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took the bill and stepped close to the street light , reading . Behold the Invisible Thy will be done 0 Lord ! I See all , Know all , Tell all , Cure all . You shall see the unknown wonders . - REV . B. P. RINEHART , Spiritual Technologist . The old is ever new Way Stations in New Orleans , the home of mystery , Birmingham , New York , Chicago , Detroit and L. A. No Problem too Hard for God . Come to the Way Station . BEHOLD THE INVISIBLE ! Attend our services , prayer meetings Thrice weekly Join us in the NEW REVELATION of the OLD TIME RELIGION ! BEHOLD THE SEEN UNSEEN BEHOLD TEE INVISIBLE YE WHO ARE WEARY COME HOME ! I DO WHAT YOU WANT DONE ! DO N'T WAIT ! I dropped the leaflet into the gutter and moved on . I walked slowly , my breath still coming hard . Could it be ? Soon I reached the sign . It hung above a store that had been converted into a church , and I stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind me I heard the rise and fall of an old-fashioned  | prayer such as I had n't heard since leaving the campus ; and then only when visiting country preachers were asked to pray . The voice rose and fell in a rhythmical , dreamlike recital  --  part enumeration of earthly trials undergone by the congregation , part rapt display of vocal virtuosity , part appeal to God . I was still wiping my face and squinting at crude Biblical scenes painted on the windows when two old ladies came up to me . " Even ' , Rever'n Rinehart , " one of them said . " How 's our dear pastor this warm evening ? " Oh , no , I thought , but perhaps agreeing will cause less trouble than denying , and I said , " Good evening , sisters , " muffling my voice with my handkerchief and catching the odor of the girl 's perfume from my hand . " This here 's Sister Harris , Rever'n . She come to join our little band . " " God bless you , Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , Rever'n , I once heard you preach years ago . You was just a lil ' ole twelve-year-ole boy , back in Virginia . And here I come North and find you , praise God , still preaching the gospel , doing the Lord 's work . Still preaching the ole time religion here in this wicked city ? " " Er , Sister Harris , " the other sister said , " we better get on in and find our seats . Besides , the pastor 's kind of got things to do . Though you are here a little early , are n't you , Rever'n ? " " Yes , " I said , dabbing my mouth with my handkerchief . They were motherly old women of the southern type and I suddenly felt a nameless despair . I wanted to tell them that Rinehart was a fraud , but now there came a shout from inside the church and I heard a burst of music . " Just lissen to it , Sister Harris . That 's the new kind of guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't it heavenly ? " " Praise God , " Sister Harris said . " Praise God ! " " Excuse us , Rever'n , I have to see Sister Judkins about the money she collected for the building fund . And , Rever'n , last night I sold ten recordings of your inspiring sermon . Even sold one to the white lady I work for . " " Bless you , " I found myself saying in a voice heavy with despair , " bless you , bless you . " Then the door opened and I looked past their heads into a small crowded room of men and women sitting in folding chairs , to the  | front where a slender woman in a rusty black robe played passionate boogie-woogie on an upright piano along with a young man wearing a skull cap who struck righteous riffs from an electric guitar which was connected to an amplifier that hung from the ceiling above a gleaming white and gold pulpit . A man in an elegant red cardinal 's robe and a high lace collar stood resting against an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the congregation shouted in the unknown tongue . And back and high on the wall above him there arched the words in letters of gold : LET THERE BE LIGHT ! The whole scene quivered vague and mysterious in the green light , then the door closed and the sound muted down . It was too much for me . I removed my glasses and tucked the white hat carefully beneath my arm and walked away . Can it be , I thought , can it actually be ? And I knew that it was . I had heard of it before but I 'd never come so close . Still , could he be all of them : Rine the runner and Rine the gambler and Rine the briber and Rine the lover and Rinehart the Reverend ? Could he himself be both rind and heart ? What is real anyway ? But how could I doubt it ? He was a broad man , a man of parts who got around . Rinehart the rounder . It was true as I was true . His world was possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I was a fool . I must have been crazy and blind . The world in which we lived was without boundaries . A vast seething , hot world of fluidity , and Rine the rascal was at home . Perhaps only Rine the rascal was at home in it . It was unbelievable , but perhaps only the unbelievable could be believed . Perhaps the truth was always a lie . Perhaps , I thought , the whole thing should roll off me like drops of water rolling off Jack 's glass eye . I should search out the proper political classification , label Rinehart and his situation and quickly forget it . I hurried away from the church so swiftly that I found myself back at the office before I remembered that I was going to Hambro 's . I was both depressed and fascinated . I wanted to . know Rinehart and yet , I thought , I 'm upset because I know I do n't have to know him , that simply becoming aware of his existence , being mistaken for him , is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be , but it is . And it can be , is , simply because it 's unknown . Jack would n't dream of such a possibility , nor Tobitt , who think he 's so  | close . Too little was known , too much was in the dark . I thought of Clifton and of Jack himself ; how much was really known about either of them ? How much was known about me ? Who from my old life had challenged me ? And after all this time I had just discovered Jack 's missing eye . My entire body started to itch , as though I had just been removed from a plaster cast and was unused to the new freedom of movement . In the South everyone knew you , but coming North was a jump into the unknown . How many days could you walk the streets of the big city without encountering anyone who knew you , and how many nights ? You could actually make yourself anew . The notion was frightening , for now the world seemed to flow before my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognition of necessity , it was the recognition of possibility . And sitting there trembling I caught a brief glimpse of the possibilities posed by Rinehart 's multiple personalities and turned away . It was too vast and confusing to contemplate . Then I looked at the polished lenses of the glasses and laughed . I had been trying simply to turn them into a disguise but they had become a political instrument instead ; for if Rinehart could use them in his work , no doubt I could use them in mine . It was too simple , and yet they had already opened up a new section of reality for me . What would the committee say about that ? What did their theory tell them of such a world ? I recalled a report of a shoeshine boy who had encountered the best treatment in the South simply by wearing a white turban instead of his usual Dobbs or Stetson , and I fell into a fit of laughing . Jack would be outraged at the very suggestion of such a state of things . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos which he thought he was describing  --  so long ago it seemed now . . . Outside the Brotherhood we were outside history ; but inside of it they did n't see us . It was a hell of a state of affairs , we were nowhere . I wanted to back away from it , but still I wanted to discuss it , to consult someone who 'd tell me it was only a brief , emotional illusion . I wanted the props put back beneath the world . So now I had a real need to see Hambro . Getting up to go , I looked at the wall map and laughed at Columbus . What an India he 'd found ! I was almost across the hall when I remembered and came back and put on the hat and glasses . I 'd need them to carry me through the streets . I took a cab . Hambro lived in the West Eighties , and once in the vestibule I tucked the hat under my arm and put the glasses in my  | pocket along with Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket was getting overloaded . I was shown into a small , book-lined study by Hambro himself . From another part of the apartment came a child 's voice singing Humpty Dumpty , awakening humiliating memories of my first Easter program during which I had stood before the church audience and forgotten the words .. . " My kid , " Hambro said , " filibustering against going to bed . A real sea lawyer , that kid . " The child was singing Hickory Dickory Dock , very fast , as Hambro shut the door . He was saying something about the child and I looked at him with sudden irritation . With Rinehart on my mind , why had I come here ? Hambro was so tall that when he crossed his legs both feet touched the floor . He had been my teacher during my period of indoctrination and now I realized that I should n't have come . Hambro 's lawyer 's mind was too narrowly logical . He 'd see Rinehart simply as a criminal , my obsession as a fall into pure mysticism . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see it , I thought . Then I decided to ask him about conditions uptown and leave .. . " Look , Brother Hambro , " I said , " what 's to be done about my district ? " He looked at me with a dry smile . " Have I become one of those bores who talk too much about their children ? " " Oh , no , it 's not that , " I said . " I 've had a hard day . I 'm nervous . With Clifton 's death and things in the district so bad , I guess . . . " Of course , " he said , still smiling , " but why are you worried about the district ? " " Because things are getting out of hand . Ras 's men tried to rough me up tonight and our strength is steadily going to hell . " " That 's regrettable , " he said , " but there 's nothing to be done about it that would n't upset the larger plan . It 's unfortunate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The distant child had stopped singing now , and it was dead quiet . I looked at the angular composure of his face searching for the sincerity in his words . I could feel some deep change . It was as though my discovery of Rinehart had opened a gulf between us over which , though we sat within touching distance , our voices barely carried and then fell flat , without an echo . I tried to shake it away , but still the distance , so great that neither could grasp the emotional tone of the other , remained .  | " Sacrifice ? " my voice said . " You say that very easily . " " Just the same , though , all who leave must be considered expendable . The new directives must be followed rigidly . " It sounded unreal , an antiphonal game . " But why ? " I said . " Why must the directives be changed in my district when the old methods are needed  --  especially now ? " Somehow I could n't get the needed urgency into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , darted just beneath the surface of my mind ; something that had to do v ith me intimately . " It 's simple , Brother , " Hambro was saying . " We are making temporary alliances with other political groups and the interests of one group of brothers must be sacrificed to that of the whole . " " Why was n't I told of this ? " I said . " You will be , in time , by the committee ? Sacrifice is necessary now ? " " But should n't sacrifice be made willingly by those who know what they are doing ? My people do n't understand why they 're being sacrificed . They do n't even know they 're being sacrificed  --  at least not by us . . . " But what , my mind went on , if they 're as willing to be duped by the Brotherhood as by Rinehart ? I sat up at the thought and there must have been an odd expression on my face , for Hambro , who was resting his elbows upon the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyebrows as though expecting me to continue . Then he said , " The disciplined members will understand . " I pulled Tarp 's leg chain from my pocket and slipped it over my knuckles . He did n't notice . " Do n't you realize that we have only a handful of disciplined members left ? Today the funeral brought out hundreds who 'll drop away as soon as they see we 're not following through . And now we 're being attacked on the streets . Ca n't you understand ? Other groups are circulating petitions , Ras is calling for violence . The committee is mistaken if they think this is going to die down . " He shrugged . " It 's a risk which we must take . All of us must sacrifice for the good of the whole . Change is achieved through sacrifice . We follow the laws of reality , so we make sacrifices . " " But the community is demanding equality of sacrifice , " I said . " We 've never asked for special treatment . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have to protect our gains . It 's inevitable that some must make greater sacrifices than others ... "
