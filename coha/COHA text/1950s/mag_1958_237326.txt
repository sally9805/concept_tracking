FLASHES IN THE NIGHT , edited by William Juhasz and Abraham Rothberg ( 87 pp. ; Random House ; $2.50 ) , is a collection of seven short stories by Hungarian writers . Some of the authors took part in the recent revolt and wound up in jail . Some , not all , were Communist Party members , and some stood high in the esteem of their masters . Yet all are aware , in varying degrees , that they and their countrymen are living falsely because they are not living freely . Not all of these stories are good and no one of them is first rate , yet they are pathetically moving because their authors can be felt , and almost seen , each in the tricky situation of one who must tell a necessary truth and may forever lose his right to speak if he tells it . <P> The best two stories are by Tibor Dery. and his theme is the facelessness of oppression in totalitarian life .

And when his wife comes home from work and his son from school , there is a moving confrontation that shows how the faceless horror can beat upon yet not crush out the deepest feelings of its victims . Tibor Dery 's Behind the Brick Wall tells a story in which impoverished factory workmen are forced to steal , workers ' " trials " force pathetic culprits into suicide , and decent men in positions of power are made literally sick by the actions they must take . No one can read it without briefly sharing the sickness . <P> CHEZ PA VAN , by Richard Llewellyn ( 527 pp. ; Doubleday ; $4.95 ) , is one of those literary stews that have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets of a snobbish Parisian hotel promise more than enough meat for a pungent bestseller .
