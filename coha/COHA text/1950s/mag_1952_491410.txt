I WAS THE WITNESS By WHITTAKER CHAMBERS THE BACKGROUND HITTAKER CHAMBERS , who was instrumental in bringing Alger Hiss to trial in one of the most sensational communist cases of our times , joined the Communist 1939 joinedin 1925 . He quit the party in 1938 , and Fri becoming joined the staff of Time magazine , ultimately ' ' ecoming a senior editor of that publication . During his years as an active communist , Cham- , iers served on the editorial staff of the Daily Worker , ' coding communist publication in this country , and was editor of the New Masses , the communist magazine . In the early days of the New Deal , he was a courier for the communist underground . In this capacity , he received confidential State Department information and documents from Alger " lag , who was a secret party member , and trans ( - .

In 1939 , when the second World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his story of the espionage network in the heart of Government to A. A. Berle , then Assistant Secretary of State in Charge of Security . The report was presented to President Roosevelt , who , it is said , laughed it off . The matter then languished until 1948 , when Chambers , testifying before the House Committee on Un-American Activities , accused Hiss of party membership . Hiss denied the charge . Later , appearing before the grand jury , Chambers accused Hiss of espionage in turning over to him confidential State Department materials . Hiss , before the same grand jury , denied having given Chambers the materials and also denied knowing Chambers after 1937 . On these two points the grand jury indicted Hiss for perjury , the statuteof limitations having precluded prosecution for his espionage activities . At the time Hiss was indicted , he was forty-four and president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Behind him lay eleven years of influential service in the State Department . He had been in some of its inner councils and executive secretary of the Dumbarton Oaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous Yalta Conference , and had served as secretary-general of the San Francisco meeting at which the United Nations was born . With Chambers as the chief prosecution witness , Hiss was tried before a jury in New York and convicted . The Court of Appeals for the Second District upheld the verdict , and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to review the case . Hiss is now serving his five-year term in the Federal penitentiary at Lewisburg , Pennsylvania . ELOVED Children : I am sitting in the kitchen of the little house at Medfield , our second farm , which is cut off by the ridge and a quarter mile across the fields from our home place , where you are . I am writing a book . In it , I am speaking to you . But I am also speaking to the world . To both of you I owe an accounting . My accounting is a terrible book which I am writing for the American people . It is terrible in what it tells about men . If anything , it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live . It isabout what the world calls the Hiss-Chambers Case , or even more simply , the Hiss Case . It is about a spy case . All the props of an espionage case are there  --  foreign agents , household traitors , stolen documents , microfilm , furtive meetings , secret hideaways , phony names , an informer , investigations , trials , official justice . But if the Hiss Case were only this , it would not be worth my writing about or your reading about . It would he another fat folder in the sad files of the police , another crime drama in which the props would he mistaken for the play ( as many people have consistently mistaken them ) . The case , however , was more than human tragedy . Much more than Alger Hiss or Whittaker Chambers was on trial in the trials of Alger Hiss . Two faiths were on trial . Human societies , like human beings , live by faith and die when faith dies . At issue in the I-liss Case was the question whether this sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its extremity still cast up a man whose faith ? in it was so great that he would voluntarily abandon those things which men hold good , including life , to defend it . At issue was the question whether this man 's faith could prevail against a man whose equal faith it was that this society is sick beyond saving , and that mercy itself pleads for its swift extinction and replacement by another . At issue was the question whether , in this desperately divided society , there still remained the will to recognize the issues . At heart , the Great Case was this critical conflict of faiths ; that is why it was a great case . On a scale personal enough to be felt by all , but big enough to be symbolic , the two irreconcilable faiths of our time ? Communism and Freedom  --  came to grips in the persons of two resolute men . Indeed , it would have been hard to find two other men who knew the meaning of the issues so clearly . Roth had been schooled in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained by the same party in the same selfless , semi-soldierly discipline . Neither would or could yield without betraying , not himself , but his faith ; and the different character of these faiths was shown by the different conduct of the two men toward each other throughout the struggle . For , with dark certitude , both knew , almost from the beginning , that the Great Case could end only in the destruction of one or both of the contending figures , just as the history of our times  --  so both men had been taught  --  can end only in the destruction of one or both of the contending forces . But this destruction is not the tragedy . The nature of tragedy is itself misunderstood . Part of the World supposes that the tragedy in the Hiss Case Iles in the acts of disloyalty that were revealed . Part believes that the tragedy lies in the fact that an able , intelligent man , Alger Hiss , was cut short in the course of a brilliant public career . Some find it tragic that Whittaker Chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and a secure future to haunt for the rest of his days the ruins of his own life . These are shocking facts , criminal facts , disturbing facts ; they are not tragic . Crime , violence , infamy are not tragedy . Tragedy occurs when a human soul awakes and seeks , in suffering and pain , to free itself from crime , violence and infamy , even at the cost of life . The struggle is the tragedy ? not defeat or death . That is why the spectacle of tragedy has always filled men , not with despair , but with a sense of hope and exaltation . That is why this terrible book is also a book of hope . For it is about the struggle of the human soul  --  of more than one human soul . It is in this sense that the Riga Case is a tragedy . This is its meaning beyond the headlines , the revelations , the shame and suffering of the people involved . The Historic Ordeal of Our Times B UT this tragedy will have been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the world takes hope and heart to begin its own tragic struggle with the evil that besets it from within and from without ; unless it realizes that this case has turned a finger of fierce light into the suddenly opened and reeking body of our time . My children , as long as you live , the shadow of the Hiss Case will brush you . In every pair of eyes that rests on you , you will see pass , like a cloud passing behind a woods in winter , the memory of your father  --  dissembled in friendly eyes , lurking in unfriendly eyes . Sometimes you will wonder which is harder to bear : friendly forgiveness or forthright hate . In time , therefore , when the sum of your exPerience of life gives you authority , you will ask Yourselves the question : What was my father ? I will give you an answer : I was a witness . I do not mean a witness for the Government or against Alger Hiss and the others . Nor do I mean the short , squat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public buildings to testify before congressional committees , grand juries , loyalty boards , courts of law . A man is not primarily a witness against something . That is only incidental to the fact that he is a witness for something . A witness , in the sense that I am using the word , is a man whose life and faith are so completely one that when the challenge comes to step out and testify for his faith , he does so , disregarding all risks , accepting all consequences . It was my fate to be , in turn , a witness to each of the two great faiths of our time . And so we come to the terrible word , communism . My very dear children , nothing in all these pages will be written so much for you , though it is Ho unlike anything you Would want to read . In nothing shall I be so much a witness , in no way am I so much called upon to fulfill My task , as in trying to make clear to you  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of its power , which was the cause of my ordeal as a man , and remains the historic ordeal of the world in the twentieth century . For in this century , within the next decades , will he decided for generations whether all mankind is to become communist , whether the whole world is to become free , or whether , in the struggle , civilization , as We know it , is to be completely destroyed or completely changed . It is our fate to live upon that turning point in history . The world has reached that turning point by the steep stages of a crisis mounting for generations . Few men are so dull that they do not know that the crisis exists and that it threatens their lives at every point . It is popular to call it a social crisis . It is in fact a total crisis ? religious , moral , intellectual , social , political , economic . Communism , which claims to be a solution of the crisis , is itself a symptom and an irritant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of science and technology upon mankind which , neither socially nor morally , has caught up with the problems posed by that impact . In part , it is caused by men 's efforts to solve those problems . World wars are the military expression of the crisis . World-wide depressions are its economic expression . Universal desperation is its spiritual climate . This is the climate of communism . I see in communism the focus of the concentrated evil of our time . You will ask : Why , then , do men become communists ? How did it happen that you , our loved father , were once a communist ? Were you simply stupid ? No , I was not stupid . Were youmorally depraved ? No , I was not morally depraved . Indeed , educated men become communists chiefly for moral reasons . Did you not know that the crimes and horrors of communism are inherent in communism ? Yes , I knew that fact . Then why did you become a communist ? It would help more to ask : How did it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcasts , became this immense force that now contests the mastery of mankind ? Even when all the chances and mistakes of history are allowed for , the answer must be : Communism makes some profound appeal to the human mind . You will not find out what it is by calling communism names . That will not help much to explain why communism , whose horrors on a scale unparalleled in history are now public knowledge , still recruits its thousands and holds its millions  --  among them some of the best minds alive . Look at Klaus Fuchs , standing in the London dock , quiet , doomed , destroyed , and say whether it is possible to answer in that way the simple question : Why ? // First , let me try to say what communism is not . It is not simply a vicious plot hatched by wicked men in a sub-cellar . It is not just the writings of Marx and Lenin , dialectical materialism , the Politburo , the labor theory of value , the theory of the general strike , the Red Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictatorship of the proletariat , the technique of the coup d'itat . It is not even those chanting , bannered millions that stream periodically , like disorganized armies , through the heart of the world 's capitals : Moscow , New York , Tokyo , Paris , Rome . These are expressions of communism , but they are not what communism is about . In the Hiss trials , where communism was a haunting specter , but which did little or nothing to explain communism , communists were assumed to be criminals , pariahs , clandestine men who lead double lives under false names , travel on false passports ; who deny traditional religion , morality and the sanctity of oaths ; who preach violence and practice treason . These things are true about communists , but they are not what communism is about . The revolutionary heart of communism is not the theatrical appeal : " Workers of the world , unite . You have nothing to lose but your chains . You have a world to gain . " What , then , is it ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy use : " Philosophers have explained the world ; it is necessary to change the world . " Communists are hound together by no secret oath . The tie that binds them across the frontiers of nations , across barriers of language and differences of class and education , in defiance of religion , morality , truth , law , honor , the weaknesses of the body and the irresolutions of the mind , even unto death , is a simple conviction : It is necessary now to change the world . Their power , whose nature baffles the rest of the world , because in a large measure the rest of the world has lost February 9 , 1952 that power , is the power to hold convictions and to act upon them . Communists are that part of mankind which has recovered the power to live or die  --  to bear witness  --  for its faith . Like all powerful faiths , its force derives from a simple vision . Other ages have had great visions . But they have always been different versions of the same vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . The communist vision is the vision of Man without God . It is the vision of man 's mind displacing God as the creative intelligence of the world . It is the vision of man 's liberated mind , by the sole force of its rational intelligence , redirecting man 's destiny and reorganizing man 's life and the world . The vision is a challenge , and it implies a threat . It challenges man to prove by his acts that he is the masterwork of the Creation . It challenges him to prove it by reducing the meaningless chaos of nature , by imposing on it his rational will to order , . abundance , security and peace . It is the vision of materialism . But it threatens , if man 's mind is unequal to the problems of man 's progress , that he will sink back into savagery . It is an intensely practical vision . The tools to turn it into reality are at hand ? science and technology , whose traditional method , the rigorous exclusion of all supernatural factors in solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vision flourishes , just as they have contributed to the crisis in which communism thrives . For the vision is shared by millions who are not communists , and they are part of communism 's secret strength . Hence the Communist Party is quite justified in calling itself the most revolutionary party in history . It has posed in practical form the most revolutionary question in history : God or Man ? This , then , is communism 's moral sanction , which is twofold : Its vision points the way to the future ; its faith labors to turn the future into present reality . It says to every man who joins it : the vision is a practical problem of history ; the way to achibve it is a practical problem of politics , which is the present tense of history . Have you the moral strength to take upon yourself the crimes of history so that man at last may close his chronicle of age-old , senseless suffering , and replace it with purpose and a plan ? The answer a man makes to this question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals , fellow travelers , unclassified progressives and men of good will , all of whom share the same vision , but do not share the faith ? because they will not take upon themselves the penalties of the faith . You will ask : Why , then , do men cease to be communists ? One answer is : Very few do . Thirty years after the Russian Revolution , after the known atrocities , the purges , the revelations and the jolting zigzags of communist politics , there is only a handful of ex-communists in the whole world . By ex-communists I do not mean those who break with communism over differences of strategy and tactics ( as did Trotsky ) or of organization ( as did Tito ) . Those breaks are merely quarrels over a road map by people all of whom are in a hurry to get to the same place . Nor , by ex-communists , do I mean those thousands who continually drift into the Communist Party and out again . These are the spiritual vagrants of our time whose traditional faith has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for an intellectual night 's lodging . By an ex-communist , I mean a man who knew clearly why he became a communist , who served communism devotedly and knew why he served it. ; who broke with communism unconditionally and knew why he broke with it . Of these there are very few  --  an index to the power of communism and the power of the crisis . It is also a fact that a man can join the Communist Party and can be very active in it for years , without completely understanding the nature of communism or the political methods that follow inevitably from its vision . One day such incomplete communists discover that the Communist Party is not what they thought it was . They break with it and turn on it with the rage of an honest dupe , a dupe who has given a part of his life to a swindle . Often they forget that it takes two to make a swindle . Others remain communists for years , warmed by the light of its vision , firmly closing their eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day they have to face the facts . They are appalled at what they have abetted . They spend the rest of their days trying to explain , usually without great success , the dark clue to their complicity . As their understanding of communism was incomplete and led them to a dead end , their understanding of breaking with it is incomplete and leads them to a dead end . Their pathos is that not even the communist ordeal could teach them that man without God is just what communism said he was  --  the most intelligent of the animals ; that man without God is a beast , never more beastly than when he is most intelligent about his beastliness . Not grasping the source of the evil they sincerely hate , such ex-communists in general make ineffectual witnesses against it . They are witnesses against something ; they have ceased to be witnesses for anything . Yet , there is one experience which most sincere ex-communists share , even though they go only part way to the end of the question it poses . The daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain to me why her father , who , as an enlightened modern man , had been extremely procommunist , had become an implacable anticommunist . It was hard for her because she shared the communist vision without being a communist . But she loved her father , and the irrationality of his defection embarrassed her . " He was immensely pro-Soviet , " she said , " and then  --  you will laugh at me , but you must not laugh at my father  --  and then ? one night in Moscow ? he heard screams . That 's all . Simply one night he heard screams . " A child of Reason and the twentieth century , she knew that there is a logic of the mind . She did not know that the soul has a logic that may be more compelling than the mind 's . What communist has not heard those screams ? They come from husbands torn forever from their wives in midnight arrests . They come , muffled , from the execution cellars of the secret police , from the torture chambers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching from Berlin to Canton . They come from those freight cars loaded with men , women and children , the enemies of the communist state , locked in , packed in , left on remote sidings to freeze to death at night in the Russian winter . They come from minds driven mad by the horrors of mass starvation ordered , and enforced , as a policy of the communist state . They come from the starved skeletons , worked to death , or flogged to death ? as an example to others  --  in the freezing filth of subarctic labor camps . They come from children whose parents are suddenly , inexplicably , taken away from them  --  parents they will never see again . What communist has not heard those screams ? Execution , says the communist code , is the highest measure of social protection . What man can call himself a communist who has not accepted the fact that . Terror is an instrument of policy ? Those screams have reached every communist 's mind . Usually they stop there . But one day the communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine party tasks . He is lifting a dripping reel of microfilm from a developing tank . He is justifying to a communist fraction in a trade-union an extremely unwelcome directive of the Central Committee . He is receiving from a trusted superior an order to go to another country and , in a designated hotel , at a designated hour , meet a man whose name he will never know , but who will give him a package whose contents he will never learn . Suddenly there closes around that communist a separating silence , and in that silence he hears screams . They pierce to his soul . Why does the communist ever hear them ? Because in the end there persists in every man , however he may deny it , a scrap of soul . The communist who suffers this singular experience then says to himself : " What is happening to me ? I must be sick . " If he does not instantly stifle that scrap of soul , he is lost . If the party senses his weakness , and the party is peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , degrade him , condemn him , expel him . If it can , it will destroy him . What ex-communist has not suffered this experience in one form or another , to one degree or another ? 66 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 9 , 1952 you knew only the peace of a home governed by a father and mother whose marriage the years had deepened into the perfect love that enveloped you . Mother was a slight , overalled figure forever working for you in the house or beside you in the barns and gardens . Papa was a squat , overalled figure , who taught John , at nine , the man-size glory of driving the tractor ; or sat beside Ellen at the wheel of the truck , an embodiment of security and power , as we drove loads of cattle through the night . On summer Sundays , you sat between papa and mamma in the Quaker meetinghouse . Through the open doors , as you tried not to twist and turn in the long silence , you could see the far , blue Maryland hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . Only Ellen had vague , troubled recollection of another time and another image of papa . Then ? it was during the years 1938 and 1939 after he had deserted from communism  --  if for any reason she pattered down the hail at night , she would find papa , with the light on , writing , with a revolver on the table or a gun against the chair . She knew that there were people who wanted to kill papa and who might try to kidnap her . But a wide sea of sunlight and of time lay between that puzzling recollection and the farm . The farm was your kingdom , and the world lay far beyond the protecting walls thrown up by work and love . It is true that comic strips were not encouraged , comic books were banned , the radio could be turned on only by permission , which was seldom given ? or asked  --  and you saw few movies . But you grew in the presence of eternal wonders . There was the birth of lambs and calves . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and painful  --  nothing is more constant on a farm than death . Sometimes , of a spring evening , papa would hear that distant honking that always makes his scalp tingle , and we would all rush out to see the wild geese , in lines of hundreds , steer up from the southwest , turn over the barn as over a landmark , and head into the north . Or on autumn nights of sudden cold , papa would call you out of the house to stand with him in the now-celebrated pumpkin patch and watch the northern lights flicker in electric clouds on the horizon , mount , die down , fade and mount again till they filled the whole northern sky with ghostly light in motion . Thus , as children , you experienced two of the most important things men ever knew  --  the wonder of life and the wonder of the universe . I have watched greatness touch you in another way . I have seen you sit , uninvited and unforced , listening in complete silence to the third movement of the Ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children can , when I told you that that music was the moment at which Beethoven finally passed beyond the suffering of his life on earth and reached for the hand of God , as God reaches for the hand of Adam in Michelangelo 's vision of the Creation . And once , in place of a bedtime story , I was reading Shakespeare to John  --  at his own request , for I never forced such things on you . I came to that passage in which Macbeth , having murdered Duncan , realizes what he has done to his own soul , and asks if all the water in the world can ever wash the blood from his hand , or will it not rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine ? At that line , John 's whole body twitched . I gave great silent thanks to God . For I knew that if , as children , you could thus feel in your souls the reverence and awe for life and the world , which is the ultimate meaning of Beethoven and Shakespeare , as men and women you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great faith that sooner or later you would understand what I once told you , not because I expected you to understand it then , but because I hoped that you would remember it later : " True wisdom comes from the overcoming of suffering and sin . All true wisdom is therefore touched with sadness . " If all this sounds unduly solemn , you know that our lives were not ; that all of us suffer from an incurable itch to puncture false solemnity . In our daily lives , we were fun-loving and gay . For those who have solemnity in their souls generally have enough of it there , and do not need to force it into their faces . Then , on August 3 , 1948 , you learned for the first time that your father had once been a communist , that he had worked in something called " the underground , " that it was shameful , and that for some reason he was in Washington telling the world about it . While he was in the underground , he testified , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was a man with the odd name of Alger Hiss . Later , Alger Hiss denied the allegation . Thus the Great Case began , and with it our lives were changed forever . One evening during the first year of the case we had been doing the milking together . For us , one of the few happy results of the case was that at last I could be home with you most of the time ? in life these good things usually come too little or too late . I was washing and disinfecting the cows , and putting on and taking off the milkers . You were stripping after me . I waited until the last cow was stripped and the last can lifted into the cooler . Then I stole into the upper barn and out into the apple orchard . It was a very dark night . The stars were large and cold . This cold was one with the coldness in myself . In the quiet , there suddenly swept over my mind a clear realization of our true position  --  obscure , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line-up of the most powerful groups and men , in the country , the bitterly hostile reaction of much of the press , the smiling skepticism of much of the public , the venomous calumnies of the Hiss forces , the all but universal failure to understand the real meaning of the case or my real purpose . A sense of the enormous futility of my effort and my own inadequacy drowned me . I felt a physical cold creep through me , settle around my heart and freeze any pulse of hope . The sight of you children , guiltless and defenseless , was more than I could hear . I was alone against the world ; my longing was to be left completely alone , or not to be at all . It was that death of the will which communism , with great cunning , always tries to induce in its victims . My children , when you were little , we used sometimes to go for walks in our pine woods . In the open fields , you would run along by yourselves . But you used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , where it was darker , lonelier , and in the stillness our voices sounded loud and frightening . In this book I am again giving you my hands . I am leading you , not through cool pine woods , but up and up a narrow defile between bare and steep rocks from which in shadow things uncoil and slither away . It will be dark . Before you understand the meaning of the journey , I may not be there , my hands may have slipped from yours . It will not matter . For when you understand what you see , you will no longer be children . You will know that life is pain , that each of us hangs always upon the cross of himself . And when you know that this is true of every man , woman and child on earth , you will be wise . YOUR FATHER Having spoken to his children , and through them to all of us , Whittaker Chambers begins the story of the Hiss Case and the strange and often tragic events of his life which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Sunday , August 1 , 1948 , I was sitting in my office on the twenty-ninth floor of the Time and Life Building when the telephone rang . Washington was calling and I was told that David Sentner , of Hearst 's Washington Bureau , wanted to speak with me . I had not heard that name in many years . But I remembered Sentner . When I had been a student at Columbia University , trying to write poetry , I had once been introduced to him . To me , the introduction had been awesome . Sentner was then a student in the School of Journalism . He was a veteran of the first World War . He not only wrote poetry ; he got it published in the campus magazines . To me , he was the symbol of worldly experience and literary success . He , of course , knew nothing of my thoughts  --  we so seldom know what is passing behind the eyes that rest on us . This flash back , which took only an instant , was the first wrench , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of recollection that was to last the better part of two years and to amount almost to a total recall of my whole life . Sentner did not remember me . " Are you the Time editor , " he asked , " who has just been subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities ? " I said that I did not know . From the sudden silence , I realized that Sentner thought that I did know . It was the first flick of that universal disbelief that was to envelop me for more than two years . Later , the New York Journal-American called and asked the same question . I still did not know the answer . Karl Marx wrote that the great scenes of history are always enacted twice  --  the first time as tragedy , the second time as comedy . The Hiss Case reversed the Marxian order . The comedy with Sentner and the press occurred because the committee , without notifying me that a subpoena was coming , had already released the news to the press in Washington . " Is Chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the committee 's chief investigator . Stripling hemmed , and said that he did not know . Possibly he did not . It is nearly incredible , but it seems to be quite true , that at that time few members of the committee had more than a vague inkling of what I might testify to , or even if they could get me to testify at all . Thus , the Great Case began ? with a flourish of that showmanship which has dogged the committee all its days , and which has been played up and exaggerated by countless enemies in the press and public life . Yet showmanship was almost the only weapon the committee possessed . Without that flair for showmanship , which was the peculiar talent of Chief Investigator Stripling , the extremely important work which the committee has done in exposing the communist conspiracy would have been reduced to a nullity . I do not mean to give the impression that I did not know that I might sometime be subpoenaed . On pleasant mornings , after the barn work is done on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down our long lane to get the daily mail . This little walk is one of our brief breathers , when we relax and look around us , note the growth of things that we have planted and the dozens of jobs to be done . It is our quiet time in the sun . One July morning , less than a month before the committee issued its subpoena , I drew the local paper out of the mailbox and saw that Elizabeth Bentley was to testify in Washington . I guessed that she was the former underground worker . I showed the story to
