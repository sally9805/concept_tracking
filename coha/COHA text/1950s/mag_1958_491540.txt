My Life With Seven Skunks By ERA ZISTEL it did n't really start with Baby Jake . It began , actually , with Jake , the skunk , a whole year before . Or you might even say it began with the beginning of the raccoons , which was two years before that . At first there was only one raccoon . We saw her in the back yard one night and put out food for her . In time she became so tame that she accepted the food from our hands  --  or our pockets , or our outdoor icebox if we forgot to close the door tight  --  and then she became so tame she demanded it , Finally this particular raccoon had babies , and brought them around to see us . So wr bought still more food  --  bread and oatmeal and peanuts  --  and gave them almost all they wanted . There 's no such thing as giving raccoons all they want , because their stomachs seem to be bottomless . In due time the babieshad babies and we had quite a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oatmeal in the biggest cartons and peanuts by the t wen ty-five-pound sack . Pretty soon , every night when I fed the raccoons , this Jake would come horning in  --  not unpleasantly , you understand , but just quietly working his way through the crowd to pick up as much as he could . As I did n't know him then , but thought I knew plenty about skunks  --  all bad  --  the moment he came / left in a hurry . That is , until I started taking pictures . With a camera in my hands I 'm stubborn . And that was how we finally got acquainted  --  Jake and 1 ? through the camera 's eye , so to speak . He was really a very decent fellow . He did n't mind my taking pictures . He did n't mind when , in barking up to get a shot , Istepped on his tail , or when I tripped over him in the dark . Fortunately . With the first light snowfall , the raccoons got that faraway look in their eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bottomless bellies close to the ground , and did not come back again . Jake stayed on a little longer . That was how we got still better acquainted . just because the raccoons had departed for their winter sleep was no good reason to leave poor Jake in the lurch . So I sat on the back steps and chucked pieces of bread to him . He ate daintily and finally trusted me enough to come snuffling around my feet , with his tail down instead of up and his body going all one way instead of twisted around at the back to show me the weapon he carried there . In other words , we had become friends . Then the snow got deeper and he did n't come around any more either , and we bought loaves of bread and pounds of oatmeal and big chunks of suet to feed the birds instead . I had forgotten about Jake  --  such is the inconstancy of hunt:ins  --  when one night , early in March it must have been , I heard a rustling as I stepped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skunk dancing around rne . The first thing I thought of , foolishly , was rabies . But as I stood there , afraid to move , and the skunk continued to dip in : mil out and circle about my feet , I realized that the dance was a joyous expression of reunion . It was my old friend , , Jake , and he had n't forgotten me . Having awakened to greet the spring , he was back and was now telling me how glad he was to see mc . Especially since he was very hungry , So we took up where we had left off . I sat on the back steps , handing out bread to him . Since his stomach fortunately had a bottom , he ate until he 'd had enough and then went quietly away , making a funny little tracery of pudgy skunk tracks in the snow . It took me some time to realize that the wandering , crisscrossing tracks led invariably to the goat shed , under which the wood rats hadtunneled and lived during the winter . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed the rats ' tunnel had been considerably enlarged . In spite of all the books I 've read on the subject , I did not then know That , whew rats go , skunks follow ; where rats live , skunks soon take tip residenue , rind Where skunks are , rats eventually cease 10 exist . Finally there was no mistaking the fact that Jake had taken over the rals ' quarters . A mound of earth , two feet high and two feet across , appeared at the entrance to the tunnel ; also an assortment of dishes the rats had swiped and hidden under the shed . Then things began to disappear : burlap bags , string , a quantity of loose hay , bits of cloth , an old mop and even a piece of plastic glass . Here my reading had actually led me astray . Books  --  all those I 've seen , anyway  --  say skunks do n't build their own homes or make nests . They bunk in with woodchucks or crawl into abandoned rabbit burrows and are satisfied to leave things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc wrong or Jake was exceptional . Judging from what appeared and disappeared , I 'd say he had done considerable renovating . Once , in one of the dishes he returned mi. , there was even an old earth-Harkened nickel . It pleased me to think of it as it tip for good service , Toward the middle of May the raccoons woke up and came back , their little bottomless bellies all shrunk from their winter 's fasting , and poor Jake , when he came for his evening handout , was jostled and shoved aside . He hovered on the outskirts of the snatching , noisy horde , managing to pick up a small morsel now and then , only to have a robber hand pluck it from his very mouth . Although the provocation was enormous , he remained a gentleman and never once used the weapon he carried under his tail . But I felt sorry for him and found another way to provide him with his dinner . From then on , quite early in the evening I would go to the entrance of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jake ! " Soon a sleepy little black-and-white head would poke out , with its mouth open wide ; I 'd shove a slice of bread into it . the head and bread would slowly recede into the depths of the tunnel , and that would be that . Jake would be fed . Sometimes , instead of bread , I 'd offer him a small plate of leftovers . He 'd take the dish between his teeth and pull it into the tunnel , and a day or Iwo later , apparently when he did his housecleaning , it would be returned all washed and polished . That 's how Jake got twisted around and became a day instead of a night animal . Each evening . it seemed , his stomach woke up a little earlier . First , on my way from that chore to this , I 'd sec his head poked out of the tunnel , his shiny black eyes following mc wherever I went , so I 'd stop what I was doing to get him a snack . Then he took to standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , with the sun still shining , he was following mc around , frequently accompanied by several of our cats , also hungry . Soon , when I prepared food for the cats , I put some of it in a dish for Jake . Often the cats preferred to cat with him instead of with one another . One of them , a little female named Spook , found Jake a most enjoyable companion . While Jake wandered around following me , Spook wandered around following Jake . her purpose being to pounce on his delightfully feathery tail . Again , Jake was a gentleman . For days he allowed the game to be played , until the time when Spook , becoming careless , let her sharp little claws rake across the tender part of the skunk 's anatomy where the weapon is located . Jake gasped and growled and his reflexes functioned perfectly . It was only a small sample of his ire he gave the cat . but it was enough to send her off , straight as an arrow and almost as fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened to her . For an hour or two the air around our house smoldered until Spook , with a desperate tongue , washed away the stench of her misadventure . From then on , she found it preferable to play with ordinary cats ' tails , even her own , if no other was available . It must have been toward the end of May that Jake began acting peculiarly  --  downright unfriendly , even . He stopped following me around . At feeding time he would barely stick his head out of the tunnel and , with a whuffing sound distressingly close to a snarl , grab the plate of food I offered and drag it inside , so that I could not watch him cat . The cats dared not keep him company , either . Then I began to hear strange noises  --  small cries , like little animals being done to death . After a few days I noticed that these sounds reached a crescendo whenever Jake hauled the plate of food into his tunnel . And a few days after that I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel with Jake 's supper and called as usual , a head appeared as usual  --  only it was n't Jake 's . It was a bright , new , pert , tiny replica of Jake 's head . Jake had become a mother ! The head remained visible for only an instant before it was jerked back into the tunnel , to be replaced immediately by Jake 's , wearing a most unfriendly expression . First she snarled into the tunnel : then she snarled at me . Then she took the plate between her teeth and dragged it inside , and at once the noises began , and I knew what they were  --  not cries of distress , but of baby skunks squabbling over the food . The next evening Jakc appeared when I called , but just as she was about to take the plate . she received a nudge from behind that dunked her nose into it . Furious , she looked back and growled , then seemed to go through a strange upheaval , and two tiny skunks wormed their way from underneath her belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel with her nose , but the moment she turned her hack they were Out again . Finally she gave up and allowed them to come squealing around the plate . But she made it clear that my presence was unwanted , by twisting her body around to show me her weapon . I took the hint and left . When I returned , some time later , the thrcc of them were gone , and so was the plate . And underneath the shed all was quiet . The following evening when I called , Jake and the two babies appeared at once . Then another little head emerged , and another , and another . Six there were , in all . And what a gathering there was around the food dish , and what a chorus of cries , and what lovely shifting patterns of black and white as they exchanged places in their hunt for choice morsels ! After this , Jake no longer resented my 57 presence , and the babies showed toward me the complete trust that is common to all infancy . Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to permit , the babies to precede her . When they took small bites of meat from the palm of my hand , she observed and took some also . When they crawled confidently up on my lap , she crawled on it also . But when they allowed inc to stroke their fur , she watched  --  but ducked as the hand was slipped over her back . That far she would not go . This was the nicest time for all of us , I think , when the bithies were still dependent , and their world was 110 larger than the area underneath the goat shed and a few feet beyond . Immediately after has mg dined . they retired . and to secure was their retreat that neither Jake in her nocturnal wanderings nor I in the security of my own house needed to have the slightest worry about them . Oddly enough , it was Jake herself who brought an end to this ideal arrangement . No doubt she was thinking of her offspring 's future . One day  --  the sun was still quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off into the woods , and just behind her , bustling along in exactly the same way . one on each side , so close that their noses were tucked into the fur of her haunches , were two of the babies . I called to them hut , if anything , it only increased their speed away from mc . A little later the scene was repeated . And later still it was enacted a third time , and I knew what it meant . Jake had moved her babies , making three trips down the hill , taking them by twos . That night no one emerged from the tunnel when I called , and Jake 's food remained untouched until after dark , when the raccoons dug their greedy little fingers into it . was disappointed . I had wanted to take pictures of them and had delayed . Now it was too late . But I was wrong . The next day , at about the same time , there were Jake and two babies trudging up the hill . They went directly to the goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Jake emerged , alone . I watched her go down the hill and disappear into the woods , and after quite a long wait saw her return with two more babies . Directly into the tunnel they went , and again Jake came out alone to make the final trip for the last two of her family . This really set me to thinking . How did the babies know they were to go two by two ? How was it established which two were to go ? How did those that were left know they must stay where they were and wait for Jake to return ? And , most puzzling of all , how did those that had been delivered into the tunnel know they must stay there instead of following her down the hill again ? I never discovered the answers to these questions . But I saw the performance repeated often enough . Sometimes Jake and her babies would be " at home " under the goat shed . Sometimes they would be away for a day , or two or three . ! stopped worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was doing . But I was curious . So , one day when I saw a hurrying threesome start down the bill , 1 followed discreetly . Years ago , when I had gone walking through the woods where this hill levels off about a quarter of a mile away , 1 had suddenly lost my footing and fallen . The reason for this was that one leg had gone down into a hole , which 1 had not seen because it was covered with leaves . A little investigation disclosed that there were three holes , rather widely separated , all of them invisible under the heavy blanket of old leaves . Here , once , when the land below had been cow pasture , a woodchuck had used . At the time 1 found the den it was abandoned , but later there was evidence that a fox had taken up residence there . He must have stayed a year before he departed . Next came a wildcat that made the place his home for close to two years . After he disappeared , it remained vacant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing smell lingered . But now one of the tunnels to the underground chamber had been cleared , just enough to permit the entrance of a small skunk and her six babies , and into it Jake and Iwo of them vanished . Wise Jake ! From here she could take them foraging in the woods , teaching them how to dig up grubs , how to catch snakes and hum mice and rats . Living tinder the goat shed , they would he foreser dependent upon me and my bounty , and somehow she knew that the human hand , no matter how lavish and kindly , is impermanent , and therefore an untrustworthy source of supply . She preferred to put her trust in nature , which offered hardship and danger but was immortal . Nevertheless . it was nulure that brought tragedy to the family . For three days it rained . These three days Jake and her babies stayed away . I did n't worry about them . They would he quite snug in their house in the woods , I thought . Then , the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook that flows across our land between the house and the woods , usually no more than a meekly chuckling glitter in the sunlight , easily forded here and there by means of steppingstones , became a snarling torrent . Toward afternoon it began to overflow its banks . Runnels started trickling down the hill . Soon the runnels became small streams , and these began to increase in size and merged to form larger streams . Here and there on the hill the white head of a miniature waterfall appeared . Looking out of the window on this wild scene , 1 suddenly caught sight of Jake toiling up the hill . No doubt she was searching for higher ground because her home down below had been flooded . She had all six babies with her this time . Her movements were uncertain and jerky . She went here , there . running swiftly , then backtracking when she came to high water , always going up , but having to make wide detours to avoid the newly created streams . And whichever way she went , the six babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They looked so frightened , and were all so wet and muddy . that I went out into the rain in an effort to help them . While they went from one fording place to another , finding each place where they hail been accustomed to cross the brook now under deep water , 1 slogged around , testing and discarding pieces of lumber until I found two that were wide enough to be safe  --  so thought  --  and long enough to bridge the hrook . These l carried to a section where the banks were high and level , and placed them side by side , with their ends resting on the banks . Underneath , the water boiled , and just beyond , smashed against a large rock , throwing spray high in the air . But the bridge looked sturdy enough . I walked across it to test it , then returned to the house to get a handful of raw meat , which Jake loves and apparently can smell a mile against the wind . Two little balls of it I placed on the far bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the planks themselves . Then I stood and watched Jake . While I had been working on the bridge , she had gone downstream and was now on her way up again , occasionally jumping over subsidiary streams , with all her babies behind her jumping over them in turn . When she came to what had been a fording place , she would go close to the water and dip her paws in it , searching for the way to cross . The babies would go close , too , and dip their paws in also , and then she would seize the one closest to her , taking its whole head in her mouth , to drag it away . After that they would he cuffed indiscriminately and driven back , and she would lead them on again . Finally they reached the spot where I had laid the planks . Jake sniffed at the meat and turned away from it . Each of the babies sniffed and turned away also . She put two paws on the bridge , hesitated , crawled up on it . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few steps , came to another ball of meat and passed it . The baby behind her followed close , and the others began to climb on the bridge . I watched with growing excitement . It was going to work ! Then Jake caught sight of mc . She stared for a moment , turned to look at her babies , and in sudden panic drove them off the bridge and scrambled off herself . Her reasoning Mil clear enough . Since all the world about her had changed , since she could no longer trust this very ground on which she had walked so safely for so long . could I not have changed and become untrustworthy also ? I took a last look at the seven of them milling around and went away , back into the house . After I had dripped a fair-sized pool on the floor next to the stove , I went out again , lake was near the entrance to her tunnel under the goat shed , and five of the babies were with her . gave them a good portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the planks were laid . I looked all over , but could find no trace of the sixth baby . suppose by that time its body had been washed quite far downstream . Toward the middle of the summer the family began to split up . They still lived together , but not in such a tight little group . Sometimes Jake would come to dinner with only two babies , sometimes all five babies would be there , but not Jake . Occasionally the babies , out foraging on their own or bustling down the hill to their other residence , would meet Jake going in the opposite direction . They would pause , greet each other . and continue on their separate ways . When the nights began to turn cold , I saw less and less of them and frequently was not sure which one I saw . Finally there was only one . He came to dinner quite regularly , and the first snow established that he had taken over the old family home under the goat shed as his winter abode . Somewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of them slept now , rousing on some of the warmer nights to do a little hunting , but spending most of the time in deep sleep . Not so with Baby Jake . He remained active all winter , and my relationship with him became much as it had been with Jake . 1 would go to his tunnel and call , and soon a sleepy head would pop out to accept graciously the food I offered . It was quite an ideal life he had , and I was pleased , for there is nothing quite so gratifying as the knowledge that , in providing for another creature , no matter how small or insignificant , one has attained something close to perfection . Baby Jake had a warm , dry house , plenty of bedding  --  I frequently put an armful of hay near his tunnel and was amused to watch it slowly disappear  --  regular meals and , moreover , food of excellent quality ; for since there was now only one , I could afford to give him what he liked most , raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life to last . One exceptionally warm night that had the smell of spring in it I went outside and heard something come rustling toward me  --  and there was Jake at my feet . hopping around in her spring dance of reunion . I gave her food , she ate and departed . The next night , at about the same time , the stillness was shattered by a sudden hubbub  --  it sounded like a pack of rats squealing , and it came From under the goat shed . Just as 1 arrived on the scene , to investigate , out of the tunnel shot Baby Jake , and following him , in a nauseating wave , came a tremendous stench that rose and spread , swiftly engulfing the goat shed and me and the surrounding territory . And following that came Jake . What had happened was pretty obvious . Jake had returned to her summer home . After having Ix:curled it all winter , Baby Jake had just been dispowv.ed . Thai night , miserable and stinking , he W11111siered around forlornly , and where Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not 1.11m . Hut I soon found out . I . ale the nest JAN we heard mysterious humping n , . elder our house , which does not to. , - ' . .1 cellar . but only a foundation of fieldstone . In the evening Baby Jake appeared for dinner as usual , looking quite satisfied with life . He did n't even mind sharing his food with the recently returned Jake . The following morning we learned why . At the side of our house was quite large mound of earth , and under the foundation was a recently dug tunnel . Baby Jake had secured ; ten better quarters than the old home under the goat shed . Well , having a skunk living in the apartment below you would be all right , I suppose , if he were a nice , quiet , well-behoved gentleman . Baby Jake is a gentleman , to be sure , but unfortunately a convivial one . He likes to invite friends in of an evening and throw a really big party every once in a while , And whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had one living on the floor below . What a gabbling ! It wakes us up in the middle of the night , We pound on the floor with the heel of it shoe , and for a few minutes all is quiet ; then it starts up again , no more than a whisper at first , but swiftly increasing in volume . Moreover , all too often the party ends up in a fight , and the smell of this seeps up through the floor . Then , along with Baby Jake 's departing guests , we must vacate the building also , Hence our war with Baby Jake . During the day , we spend maybe up to in hour carting stones to the house to plug up Baby Jake 's tunnel . During the night , Baby Jake spends perhaps a couple of hours digging a new one , no doubt aided by his friends . And when it is finished , like as not he 'll reward them by tossing another party which , like as riot , will end up in another light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each day my husband and I perform with less enthusiasm our task of filling last night 's tunnel , and assure each other that this will surely be the last time . Obviously Baby Jake means to stay , and nothing will discourage him . For when we have gone once around the house , plugging tunnels , and there seems to be no spot left where he can dig , he tunnels under the boulders we have placed in the old ones . And this , of course , can go on indefinitely , unless we are lucky enough to hit hardpan somewhere not too close to China . In the meantime , Jake has had her new litter of babies under the goat shed . A few nights ago I saw the first little head appear briefly at the tunnel 's entrance . Soon they will all he coming out with her to gather around the dinner plate . I wonder how many there art . Also , where are they going to live when they grow up ? There is something else bothering me a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to think about it . But we made a mistake when we named Jake . Could we have made another in naming Baby Jake ? It seems to me he has become suspiciously quiet lately . I do n't think we 've had to leave the house because of one of his parties in the last couple of weeks . Is it possible those parties were of a different nature than we 'd thought , and as a result of them there arc some Little Baby Jakes in the apartment downstairs ? In that case , perhaps we 'd better not plug up the latest tunnel . And it might not be a bad idea to start looking for a house somewhere on the other side of the village .
