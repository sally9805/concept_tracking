John Roosevelt , youngest ( 38 ) of the Roosevelt boys and the only Republican among them , turned up in Washington to plead for election of a Republican Congress . John , now a California-New York businessman ( cosmetics , packaging ) , told the Citizens for Eisenhower that he would " go to hell " for Ike . He reported that he had asked his " favorite Democrat " - his mother-how to get Democratic support for G.O.P. congressional candidates this fall . " Her reply , " he said , " was hardly suitable for this meeting . "
