A terse little paragraph on the back page of Pravda disclosed last week that " Army General Ivan Aleksandrovich Serov has been released from his duties as chairman of the State Security Committee in connection with his transfer to other duties . " The announcement , which was not even repeated on the Soviet radio , was as brusque as it was brief . Just as in the case of the disgraced war hero , Marshal Georgy Zhukov , it failed to say what the general 's new duties would be-and Zhukov has yet to turn up in another post . <P> Thus Nikita Khrushchev fired his secret police chief , one of the last and most bloodstained survivors of the Stalin tyranny-a shadowy , trim little man and a gumshoe general who won his highest promotions and decorations in the " Great Patriotic War " leading grisly campaigns not against the Germans but against his own Soviet people . <P> Bloody Past . Trained at Moscow 's Frunze Military Academy to be a professional soldier , Serov was assigned on graduation to the NKVD .

When World War II began , Serov , an equal in bloodstained iniquity to Nazi Germany 's Himmler , specialized in genocide and in exterminating " anti-Soviet elements " in the new Soviet Polish and Baltic lands . <P> He supervised the Katyn Forest massacre of 4,000 Polish officers . The monstrous secret order No. 001223 , outlining procedures to be followed for executions and deportations in the Baltic states ( an estimated 1,420,000 ) , was signed by him . He shot or shipped away whole Soviet nationalities-the Crimean Tartars ( 200,000 ) , the Volga Germans ( 500,000 ) , the Chechen-Ingush ( 410,000 ) of the Caucasus . When the Red army rolled back the Germans , Serov crushed resisters behind the lines .

The " collective leadership " of the day wanted to downgrade the police , and Serov knew how to make himself inconspicuous . But Western eyes saw the sandy-haired little man snapping his fingers to summon a Soviet ambassador during B. and K. 's visit to India ( TIME , Dec. 19 , 1955 ) . When he appeared in Britain in 1956 to prepare security measures there for the touring pair , the British press denounced him so vehemently as " Ivan the Terrible " and " Butcher Serov " that he was left behind on the actual tour . <P> In the Hungarian revolution , it was Serov who broke into a peace parley between Red army generals and Hungarian freedom fighters , to treacherously seize the Hungarian commander , General Pal Maleter , who was later executed .
