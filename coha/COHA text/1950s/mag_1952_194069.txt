When Coach Lynn ( " Pappy " ) Waldorf took over the University of California football team in 1947 , the job held no great promise of security . Of his 21 predecessors , ten had coached for one season . But Pappy is still at California . In five seasons , his teams have won 46 games , tied one , lost six games ( not including three Rose Bowl contests ) . <P> Pappy has no truck with razzle-dazzle football ; his style of play is a combination of plain percentages and horse sense . In a new book called This Game of Football ( McGraw-Hill ; $4 ) , Pappy gives away his trade secret : winning teams are the product of practice , sweat and Spartan training . <P> There is no such animal as a 60-minute player , says Pappy-and never was . " The ball is in play only about twelve minutes out of 60 . " From there , Pappy counts on his players having the ball 13 times during a game , getting 65 chances to advance it , punting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quarterbacks not to worry if they have one out of nine or ten passes intercepted ( normal : 1.8 interceptions per game ) , but if the defense snares " one pass in six or seven . . . we will probably lose the game on that factor alone . " <P> Pappy keeps his attacking game simple . California uses only 13 basic running plays and eight basic pass plays , and sometimes the coach thinks " even that . . . is too many . " He is content to let the opposing team learn a staggering 80 or 100 plays , then never get a chance to use most of them . <P> Because Saturday 's millions would rather roar over touchdowns than goal-line stands , " defense is something of a stepchild in today 's football . " Present rules give the offense a slight edge over the defense , and the two-platoon system also makes the offense relatively stronger . <P> Old Rockne fans may still believe in pep talks , but Strategist Waldorf , no orator , says that " the day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins his hopes on " long hours of hard work on the practice field .
