The big white-dominated lands of southern Africa would soon look north on a solid girdle of independent black states stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean . In some parts of Middle Africa , colonialism was retreating in good order , leaving a promise , or at least hope , of peace in the transition to government by black men . In others , the process was jerky , confused and reluctant . <P> In Tanganyika , due south of Kenya , Britain 's Governor Sir Richard Turnbull announced constitutional changes giving Africans virtual home rule by late next year .

Blessed with a sensible African leader in a territory with no large white settler population , Britain was happy to make Tanganyika its first testing ground for self-rule in East Africa .
