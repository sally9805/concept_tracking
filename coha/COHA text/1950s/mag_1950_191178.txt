People who live near Muroc , Calif. are used to seeing strange sights in the sky as test pilots from Edwards Air Force Base put new planes through their paces . For the past month they have seen a fearsome thing : roaring yellow flames streaking across the night , sometimes rocketing upward to mingle with the stars . <P> The flames over Muroc come from " afterburners " on Lockheed F94 all-weather fighters that are being service-tested to determine their capabilities under simulated combat conditions . Soon such flames will be common wherever jet planes need to use their full power . Developed only a few years ago , the afterburner has proved itself a dependable source of extra power for climbing or combat . <P> In principle , the afterburner is as simple as ABC . The tailpipe of an ordinary turbojet engine is lengthened and inside its throat is placed a grid of hollow , perforated cross-pieces . When maximum power is needed , fuel is squirted into the stream of hot gas racing out of the tailpipe . There is plenty of heat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So a vast yellow flame bursts out of the pipe , and the plane gets a mighty shove forward . <P> The actual performance figures of up-to-date afterburners are secret . The great flames are probably inefficient , using floods of fuel . But they will toss a fighter up to 40,000 feet in half the time that would be needed without them . For an interceptor like the F-94 , a few minutes saved in climbing might mean success in downing an enemy bomber .
