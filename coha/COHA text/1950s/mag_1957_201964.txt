Crisis , which loves a vacuum , hovered last week over the kingdom of Jordan , a desolate desert nation of 1,500,000 Bedouins and Palestine refugees , broke and adrift now that its imperial British creators have left . Last week , seeing his country beset from within and without , Jordan 's young ( 21 ) King Hussein bravely grabbed power for himself to save his crumbling country from crackup . <P> Chaos confronted him . His rabble-rousing Arab Nationalist Premier Suleiman Nabulsi had been openly negotiating federation with Syria-which would mean the end of Jordan 's independence . The Saudis in the south and the Syrians in the north had used the Middle East crisis to send in troops ; the Iraqis were poised , ready to intervene , in the northeast ; the Israelis eyed that part of the kingdom lying west of the River Jordan . <P> The deal by which three Arab nations - Syria , Egypt and Saudi Arabia-undertook to replace Jordan 's $36 million-a-year British subsidy was proving largely a desert mirage . Syria 's first remittance turned out to be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan by Syrian army units stationed in Jordan since last fall 's Suez invasion . Desperately convinced that Jordan 's only way to survive as a kingdom was to qualify for U.S. Eisenhower plan aid , the young King publicly denounced Communist influence in the country and set out to purge the Nabulsi Cabinet of its three most blatantly pro-Communist members . <P> Swearing on the Koran . He began by sending off his court minister with letters telling his allies , Nasser , Saud and the Syrian President , what he meant to do . ( Saud 's generous reply : " You will always find me on your side in person and with my forces . " ) The Jordanian Cabinet 's taunting response was to propose establishing diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia . For the young King , the moment had come . First summoning 50 top army officers to the palace and exacting loyalty pledges , he demanded the Cabinet 's resignation . Nabulsi , a left-wing and anti-Western economist ( educated at the American University of Beirut ) , submitted his resignation but confidently expected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of seats in Jordan 's Parliament ; the explosive street crowds of Jordan were on his side , and his policies were in cahoots with Egypt and the ruling leftists in neighboring Syria . Nabulsi also could apparently count on the decisive support of opportunistic Army Chief Ali Abu Nuwar , 34 , even though the soldier had just sworn loyalty to the King on the Koran . <P> General Abu Nuwar , a shifty-eyed playboy with little command experience , is a crony of Syria 's pro-Soviet strongman , Colonel Abdel Hamid Serraj . They had met when they were fellow military attachs in Paris , now talked daily by telephone . Against this impressive lineup , the young King could count only on loyal forces inside the army and the support of Bedouin chiefs .
