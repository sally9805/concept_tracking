Nine months ago , the editors of the Marine Corps Gazette set their goal . To help mark the Corps ' 17 5th anniversary this week , they planned " to produce an accurate , concise and readable history of the Marine Corps that would definitely establish some of the word-of-mouth history and tradition . " Last week , in a special , 136-page anniversary issue priced at $1 ( regular price : 30 ) , the Gazette published a " readable history " that was also a gusty , colorful explanation of the unique esprit de corps that distinguishes the U.S. Marines from other U.S. armed services . <P> Like the Corps , the monthly Gazette has earned a solid reputation of its own . Started in 1916 as a semiofficial organ , the magazine 's circulation has climbed from 744 in 1932 to its present 18,000 , now numbers among its subscribers 28 foreign governments , including the Soviet Union ( six copies ) . A rotating board of editors , all Marine officers , gives its articles on battle tactics , training methods and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is wholly selfsupporting , also plays an important role in the continuous indoctrination of Marines , never lets them forget their blood &; glory-starred history . Some of it , as recounted in the anniversary issue : <P> When a Navy officer insulted a Marine , William Ward Burrows , first official commandant of the Marines , wrote to his Marine officer : " . . . Do n't let me see you ' till you have wiped away this disgrace . It is my duty to support my officers and I will do it with my life , but they must deserve it . " In 1836 , when Commandant Archibald <P> Henderson headed for battle with 700 Marines ( half the entire Corps ) , he tacked a laconic sign on his office door : " Gone to Florida to fight the Indians . Will be back when the war is over . " When Henderson retired after 38 years as commandant , he was so accustomed to living in the commandant 's house that he tried to will it to his heirs . <P> At Belleau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Medal of Honor* ( Boxer Rebellion and Haiti ) , was reported to have said : " Come on , you sons of bitches ! Do you want to live forever ? " But profane old Dan Daly shaken by reports that the Corps was going to be politer grimly insisted that what he said was : " For goodness sake , you chaps , let us advance against the foe ! " Col. Frederic W. Wise ( who claimed that during World War I he had originated the phrase : " Retreat , hell-we just got here ! " ) once heard his men had coined a nickname for him . He lined them up and shouted : " I hear you so-and-sos have taken to calling me ' Dopey . ' All right ; only do n't forget that I 'm also Wise ' . " The late Major General Smedley D. Butler , made a captain at 19 for bravery during the Boxer Rebellion , once walked alone into a rebel camp during a Nicaraguan revolution , seized the rebel general by his mustache , and ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproar over his burning criticisms of Mussolini , he wrote an article for Liberty entitled " To Hell with the Admirals .
