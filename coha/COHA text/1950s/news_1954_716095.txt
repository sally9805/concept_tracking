txt Whether the Eisenhower administration was well-advised in avoiding a showdown with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy ( R ) of Wisconsin in the Peress affair is a question hotly debated in Washington . Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens , the man with the strongly built-in sense of loyalty to the officers under him , has sought a session with President Eisenhower to find out whether it was necessary to capitulate to Senator McCarthy 's demands and make all officers available for questioning ? " for the sake of future politics . " Secretary Stevens was reported to be seeking a public expression of support from President Eisenhower and to be prepared to resign if he does n't get it , the Associated Press says . Mr. Stevens denied the report , but the Associated Press says it came from someone close to him , in a position to know what had gone on behin the scenes . His showdown question  --  one widely echoed among departments into which the Wisconsin senator 's investigating committee had reached ? was precisely how far the administration would go to support a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Army officers . Damage to GOP Seen The " Peress case " had ballooned up to the point where , if Senator McCarthy and Mr. Stevens had confronted each other Feb. 25 as planned , before television cameras and radio microphones , the explosive , divisive outcome would , in the opinion of high Republican officials , have been of benefit only to the Democrats . This was the viewpoint which prevailed in persuading Mr. Stevens to agree ? at a luncheon session Feb. 24 with Republican members of the McCarthy subcommittee ? to permit any and all Army officers to appear before the subcommittee ? an agreement viewed in Pentagon quarters as a complete and discouraging " capitulation " by the Army . But the verdict of those less directly and understandably concerned was that the high-policy decision not to stand and fight on the " Peress case " was determined by one simple point : It was not a strong enough case . The Army had been admittedly lax in allowing an alleged Communist , Dr. Irving Peress , to move from captain to major and then obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly ordered a thorough investigation of the " routine " procedures which could allow this to happen , and had made certain that it could not happen again , was a mitigating circumstance . Army Laxity Charged But the Army had not got rid , of Major Peress very quickly . And Senator McCarthy had been able  --  even as the big confrontation day approached  --  to headline still another instance of Army laxity : An alleged Communist who was allowed until Feb. 3 to work in Pentagon code rooms ( though the woman handled nothing but unintelligible cipher ) . The consensus within the administration itself was that , when you do battle With Senator McCarthy you had better have a crystal-clear case all around , and be sure of victory at the all-important bar of public opinion .. A second and equally persuasiv e constitutional point was that the Congress historically has the right to summon executive officials  --  including officers  --  before its investigating committees for questioning . It is done every week . And while Mr. Stevens could have substituted himself for a lower-level Army source before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testify was something which would not permanently stand up under the careful balance of powers between the executive and legislative departments . Capitulation ? Did the Secretary of the Army capitulate ? At his luncheon session with Republican members of the Senate subcommittee Feb. 24 , it was agreed that : 1 . Communism must be rooted out of the armed services . 2 . The investigation of the Peress case begun Feb. 3 will continue rapidly , and the names of all responsible for handling the Peress promotion and discharge will be given to the Senate committee , and they will be " available " for committee questioning . 3 . Until Senator W. Stuart Symington ( D ) of Missouri , a committee member , returns from Europe , General Zwicker will not be called , but thereafter he , too , will be available . To most observers , including Pentagon and State Department officials with past experience in dealing with the Wisconsin senator , this looked like pretty complete surrender .                @ @ @ @ @
