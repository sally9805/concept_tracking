@#  | Through Darkest Middle Age With Failing Memory We were sitting around at the neighbors ' the other week , and included in the company was a very nice couple , new to us , who had brought with them their very nice fourteen-year-old girl . I had been teasing the girl . Why ? Because she was fourteen years old and reacted splendidly . Among her burning curiosities was the age of all us dodderers ? most particularly , the age of her mother . It was a few minutes later that , in a lull , her mother was heard to say , " Was I ever tired the other day . " I thought it was time , after being mean to this pleasant child , to be on her side . I told her that here was a beginning , here was at least one infallible rule . Anyone who ever begins a sentence with " Was I ever " is over forty years old . The afternoon proceeded .
