Japan 's long-distance scientific atom-bomb watchers ( TIME , March 12 et seq. ) were convinced that a nuclear weapon fired by the U.S. July 3 over Bikini was carried by a rocket , not an airplane , and that it exploded at a height of at least 22 miles . <P> Kameo Ito , chief of the government 's Yamagata meteorological observatory , bases his theory on a close study of the air waves from U.S. and Soviet tests . When a bomb is exploded on the ground or near it , says Ito , the shock waves spreading upward into the lower stratosphere are lengthened and delayed by air conditions there . Eventually they are refracted downward and reach microbarographs in Japan a few minutes behind the shorter waves that have passed directly through the lower atmosphere . <P> Tell-tale Pattern . The waves from earlier U.S. and Soviet tests followed this pattern . But during this summer 's tests , Japan 's microbarographs showed a difference . With each explosion ( the U.S. has announced only one ) , the initial , shortwave phase decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher in the atmosphere . On July 3 , the Japanese picked up a wave pattern " that had almost no short waves . Ito thinks this proves that the explosion took place above 22 miles . If it did , Ito reasons , the bomb must have been carried by a rocket . No existing bomber can fly so high . <P> Testing weapons systems instead of isolated " nuclear devices " is one of the announced purposes of the U.S. tests at Bikini . One of the systems that needs testing most is the atom-armed antimissile rocket that both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are believed to be developing . To protect a target city from a long-range missile , this weapon must attack its quarry high above the atmosphere . <P> Unrestrained Fireball . Shooting it up to the proper height is not much of a problem , but no one knows how its nuclear warhead will behave when it is exploded in the near-vacuum of the upper atmosphere . With little air to resist its expansion , the unrestrained fireball may grow to enormous size . Atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be flung far enough to do damage at a considerable distance . <P> If the U.S. 's July 3 test bomb was really exploded 22 miles above the earth , it should yield valuable information in another way too . One of the toughest problems for the designers of long-range ballistic missiles is " re-entry " : i.e. , how to get the missile 's warhead down through the lower atmosphere at meteor speed without having it burn up like a meteor . If the July 3 test showed that a nuclear warhead achieves " good " effects on ground targets , even when exploded 20 miles above the surface , most of the re-entry problem will have been eliminated .
