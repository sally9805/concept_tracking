Hancock or Sam Adams . No , Dr. Powers : you 're our candidate for dove of peace . You can never be accused of self-interest . " " Senor Pollock is right , " said de Galvez . " Naturally , there is no reason why you should refer to any reward I promised you . " " No reward was mentioned , besides your gratitude , " said John . " Or should I include the happy fact that my own neck is still un-stretched ? " " Frankly , Dr. Powers , I wished to secure your help before bringingso mundane a subject as money into our conference . But His Catholic Majesty is prepared to pay you liberally . If Natchez is still neutral when peace is signed , I 'll present you with a thousand-acreland grant  --  and a substantial loan to put that land to work . You may choose your acres near either New Orleans or Natchez . Both cities have their greatest years before them . " John swallowed hard . The Governor was certainly not ungenerous .

You could become the richest doctor in the province . " " I 'm afraid your offer is out of all proportion to any service I can render , " said John  --  feeling the stiffness of his disclaimer even as he uttered it . " By no means , " said de Galvez . " I shall put it in writing , and include it with the dossier I 'll send you tomorrow . Memorize it , Doctor  --  and hold it before you as an incentive . It may give you some notion of your value to our cause . " There was more , but John remembered but little of it when he stood or . the steps of the palacio and breathed deep of the humid night breeze from the levee . His brain was whirlingp101with a dozen contrary impulses ; when he glanced at his watch in the light spill from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an hour had passed since he left the tavern . He had entered the Governor 's mansion , certain that he would emerge in irons  --  if he emerged at all . Yet he had no real sense of freedom as he took the first turning to the Place d'Armes . He was his own man again  --  with a sloop to take him upriver and a clear path to Stella Wright . Why , when the most powerful man in Louisiana had lifted the last bar , did he feel an irrational urge to hold back ? On his way to the inn , he was aware that his white-uniformed bodyguard was still three paces in his rear . He heard the click of flintlocks as they passed a cafe , and knew that a brace of footpads , intent on trailing him to the darkness of the next crossing , had slunk back to the bar . Again , at the entrance to the inn , he saw one of the guards spring forward and deflect a great , hulking fellowat bayonet point , just as the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might never have survived . The perils of the polyglot town held his attention but lightly . New Orleans was already behind him now , no less firmly than Mobile and Pensacola . His mind was riveted on a frontier outpost far upriver , and what awaited him there . The two infantrymen presented arms smartly at the stairway to his suite . He watched them take up their vigil in the courtyard ; it was only right that he should be under surveillance . Not that Bernardo de Galvez feared he would break his promise . Those two long-legged soldiers ( who resembled a pair of mournful wading birds as they paced the court ) were his guard of honor . A candle still burned in the parlor of the suite . He was a little startled to observe that the door to the bedroom was now open wide . The question answered itself when he picked up the square of note paper propped against the candlestick . Dearest : I 'll try to wait up for you.  |p102He  read the note twice before he grasped its full import . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a prelude to serious trouble ) was covering his tracks , in the event his rooms were searched in his absence ? Or was that veiled invitation all it implied  --  a summons to make this wedding masquerade real ? Pondering this second possibility , he slowly burned the note in the candle flame . The hammer blows of his pulse sounded their own warning : once he stepped across that bedroom threshold , he might no longer be the master of his desire . Remembering the kiss they had shared , he could understand Faith 's train of thought perfectly . An honest partner to the end , she had regretted her frightened withdrawal . Understanding his yearnings accurately enough , she was offering herself on his terms . He sighed deeply : it was a sigh that came from the heart . Movingon tiptoe lest he waken her , he closed the bedroom door firmly , and sought the spartan comfort of the settee.  |p105Dawn  had broken behind the bluff on the river 's eastern bank . On the western shore , where the sloop darted like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the mist in the cypress hammock that fringed the bank . Standing in the bow with a grains-pole , testing the bottom as Yulee managed the tiller , John Powers continued his search for an observation point , now that another morning was about to spread across the Mississippi . He turned to smile at Faith , poised with a foot on the gunwale , her fingers gripping the sheets . In doeskin breeches and shirt , a man 's slouch hat level with her eyes , she could have passed for a boy in that uncertain light . " Hard larboard , skipper ! Dry land ahead ! " " Hard larboard it is , sir . " Yulee 's answering shout , delivered in a clipped British accent , would not have disgraced the quarter-deck of an English manof-war . The sloop , taking the easy water under the bank , continued to play the homing swallow , there in the shadow of the cypress . Then , as the bottom lands receded downstream , a high , deep-wooded point lifted from the mists ahead . Faith dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riding smoothly behind the tug of the jib , the vessel plunged straight for the land . Just in time , Yulee brought the bowspritinto the wind . The anchor dropped in shoal water , holding the sloop steady until John could complete the mooring by lashing the painter to the first convenient tree . At that precise instant , the sun lifted above the bluff on thep106far shore . In a twinkling , the Mississippi changed from slate-gray to a rich golden-brown ; the channel danced with a hundred whitecaps , where the wind roiled its surface at the bend upstream . John shaded his eyes against the glare . He felt his spirits lift as he picked out the silhouette of the man-made palisade against the sunrise . " Fort Panmure , Doctor , " said Yulee . " The town itself lies under the bluff . You will see it plainly , once the sun has lifted . " The half-breed leaped ashore , and offered Faith his hand . The trio climbed the shore line , through a dense growth of dog fennel and water oak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yulee , John gathered , had chosen this mooring with care . Cautious to the end , he had brought his sloop upstream in the shadows of dawn , to a spot where they could study their destinationin safety . The precision of today 's mooring was part of the routine that had featured their voyage . Veteran of a hundred similar journeysupstream , Yulee had timed the laps perfectly . They had made camp each sundown on a towhead , or an islet that was both dry and deserted . Shunning the bivouacs of the riverside trails , the half-breed had spared his passengers all contact with the ruffians who frequented such spots , ready to relieve unwary voyagers of purse and life . Each night , Yulee had built a sapling framework as a foundation for their camp . Here , he spread an extra sailcloth to make a tent for Faith ; he and John slept before the coals of the campfire , wrapped to the eyes in their blankets as a protection against the insect hordes . Each dawn , the half-breed had wakened them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon broiled in the skillet , along with corn cakes and catfish fresh from the river.  |p107John  had hoped to find Faith adjusted to the rough-and-ready tempo of this voyage . Not even in his most sanguine dreams had he expected her to become part of the boat from the first day . When Yulee rested for an hour at midmorning , she had handled the tiller as easily as he . When they camped at sunset , she had hunted at John 's side  --  and shown herself equally adept at bringing in a rabbit or a wild turkey for the skillet . There had been a special enchantment in those sorties among the moss-draped oaks of some island  --  or into the woods beyond the bank , on the rare occasions when they camped on the mainland . It was a magic John had never dared to break with such intrusionsas queries on their future . Here in the wilderness , with the river as their only adversary , it had been a simple matter to still the ghost of passion  --  and easier still to forget the note he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Faith had wonderedat his withdrawal she did not betray her pique . Had she been , in truth , the slender boy she resembled , their voyage upriver could not have been more innocent . As for Yulee , if he was puzzled by the fact that Faith slept alone in that canvas shelter , he made no mention of it . The courtesy he showed both passengers was a constant thing  --  and it seemed untroubled by curiosity . From the first day , he had been Faith 's friend as well as John 's . This , too , had seemed natural , once they had adjusted to the close quarters aboard the sloop . Yulee was both Negro and Indian  --  in a land where such breeds were generallyregarded as inferior . Yet he was as free as the passengers he served with such quiet devotion ; he had never presumed on the relationship , though both treated him as an equal , Last night , they had camped on an island thick with willows . A light drizzle had tapered off at midnight , promising a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken camp before sunrise , taking to the river the moment there was light enough to mark the channel . Yulee had set his course along the western bank ; thanks to the bend upstream , the current followed the bluffs on the other shore.  |p108They  had moved upstream rapidly in the sluggish shallows . Now , staring across the whitecaps on the Father of Waters , markingthe exact shape of Natchez for the first time , John knew their arrivalcould not have been better planned . Sunrise was the proper moment to view a strange land . Any mystery , however deep , must inevitably seem clearer in the first flush of morning . He saw that Fort Panmure was strategically placed . Known as Fort Rosalie in the days of the French occupation , rechristened when the British took over that hank of the Mississippi , it seemed ridiculously small at that distance . John could understand why de Galvez had not troubled to change its name when a force of Spanishrangers had captured it , remounted its gun swivels , and settledbehind its palisade to await the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunports on the riverside . Save for the snouts of the battery , there was no sign of human occupancy . The main gate ( which opened direct to a rough corduroy road that snaked down the bluff to the river 's edge ) seemed to stand a trifle ajar . The flagstaff , thrust against the sunrise from a corner sentry box , was bare of its standard . Expecting the sound of a Spanish bugle at reveille , John wondered at the laxity of the commandant  --  thenshrugged off the question as he turned to examine the town itself , clustered on the riverbank almost in the fort 's shadow . Founded no more than a generation ago by the French , drenched in blood after Indian raids , Natchez was more village than town . Most of the houses clustered thickly below the bluff , where a few jerry-built wharves thrust into the suck of the river . John could see that these dwellings were little more than foursquarelog cabins . Some of them were clay-chinked and whitewashed ; all were blank-walled save for loopholes beneath their eaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian reprisal had receded years ago . Yet even in this straggling community , it was possible to read the future of Natchez as well as the past . Situated at a strategicp109point , surrounded by the richest farmlands in all the Mississippi Valley , the town could not help but prosper when the swords of three hostile powers were sheathed . Here and there along the bluff , vast stretches had already been cleared to make way for plantations-to-be ; while most of the land thus exposed was a wilderness of stumps , other areas were green with fresh cotton . Despite the early hour , John could pick out slave gangs at work in these prosperous furrows . Farther back from the sharp-etched silhouette of the bluff , he could see the roofs of houses that would have ornamented the demesne of any Eastern squire . These , he gathered , were the dwellings of Loyalists from the seaboard colonies ; many had floeked here with their families at the outbreak of the revolution . Faith 's voice broke his inventory . " Are you disappointed , John ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you expect another New Orleans ? " He turned as Yulee , crouched in the fork of a tree behind them , gave a sharp exclamation of surprise . " Look again at the fort , Doctor . They are watching the boats coming downriver  --  but they do not show themselves . " John swung his eyes upstream . Intent on the town and the land above the bluff , he had forgotten the river that was the genesisof Natchez . A group of flatboats , rounding the mile-long bend with the current behind them , were just drawing within gun range of the fort . The muzzles of the cannon seemed to converge on the little water caravan as stealthily as though the unseen gunners were crouched in some monster duckblind . " What do you make of it , Yulee ? " The half-breed stripped a handful of leaves from the nearest wild grape , rolled them into a tight funnel , and handed it to John . " The Indians use this when no spyglass is handy , " he said . " See for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the flatboats ; it was astonishinghow clearly the boatmen sprang into focus , now that he could concentrate his vision on a single area . Even without the sun-faded deerskins and biblical beards that muffled theirp110faces to the eyes , those lanky river rats bore the mark of Kentucky . The tarpaulin-lashed barrels amidships could contain nothing but salt meat for the New Orleans market . The cargo in the snug afterhouseswere pelts from backwoods trap lines , destined for skyrocketingmarkets abroad . " Study the fort again , Doctor , " said Yulee . His words were punctuated by the boom of a swivel gun . The cannon of Fort Panmure fired singly rather than in salvo . Round shot , falling in midstream , made a neat pattern of waterspouts , each a trifle closer to the flotilla . The meaning of the threat was unmistakable . Deep-loaded as they were , these clumsy log rafts had no choice but to run with the current , in the very shadow of the bluff . A second volley , dropped as precisely as the first , could send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatmen scurried to raise a white flag . As though in response to this signal , a broad-shouldered figure leaped into view on the ramparts . A sword flashed in the morning sun , pointing imperiously to the docks below the rampart . One by one , the flatboats snubbed in at the bank , where a score of figures were already dancing in triumph . The whole maneuver had had a ghostly quality , now that the boom of the cannon had died . A Louisiana heron , which had risen from its perch with a guttural scream , settled in the ambush of another treetop . As the first flatboat came to rest on the far bank , a flag whipped into view at last above the sentry box of the fort . It was the ensign of England , proud as a bugle call against the morning sky.  |p111John  returned to the realities of his own position when he felt Faith 's hand on his arm . Natchez " What 's happening over there , John ? Why are they firing on the boats ? " He passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost the Battle of Natchez . " The broad-shouldered figure was capering wildly on the ramparts ; even at that distance , there was something familiar about the man that John could not pin down . But the central situation was evident . The Loyalists of Natchez , by whatever stratagem , had already taken possession of Fort Panmure  --  and had just offeredgraphic proof that the guns of that tiny bastion could control the river below them . When Faith returned the telescope , he swept the eastern bank more carefully . At least a score of flatboats and bateaux were alreadymoored there , beside the most recent arrivals . " I still do n't understand , " said Faith . " Is your mission over here before it began ? " " What else ? " The trio scrambled down from the knoll in sober silence . The sloop was still at its mooring , but a visitor had gone aboard  --  a long-legged visitor in butternut homespuns , with an even longer rifle cradled in one arm . John 's hand closed on Yulee 's wrist as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk warily , until this situation was clarified . Three other men emerged from a canebrake with rifles alert . Like the man on the sloop , they wore homemade trousers , butternutshirts , and snakeproof hoots  --  the universal garb of the riverman . And yet , they had more than a semblance of military authority about them . All were obviously awaiting orders from the man on deck , whose lopsided grin seemed oddly friendly , when measured against those leveled guns . " Just drop your fowling piece , mister , " he called . " And tell your boy to do the same . That way , no one 's likely to get hurt . " " Who are you ? " " I 'll ask the questions . You 're doing the visiting . " John spoke loudly enough for all four captors to hear . " I 'm Dr.p112John Powers . These are my wife and boatman . I 'm en route to Natchez to call on Dr. Evan Wright . " " Are you , now ? Is he expecting you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Major Ned Beasley , Doc . Militia commander of the forces of King George . " " I thought the only troops here were Spanish . " " If you were spying from that knoll , you 'll know different now . " John kept voice and temper level . " We ran upriver to approach with the current , " he said . " We were taking a bearing on the town . " The lanky countryman shrugged . " Best tell that story to the colonel first . I 'll send word to Dr. Wright that you 've arrived safe and sound . " " As you like , " said John . He stepped aboard the sloop , and gave his hand to Faith . " Come , my dear . We must satisfy the military that we 're honest . Can we ferry you across , Major ? " " Sure can , Doc . The boys will follow us . " Yulee was already at the sheets without awaiting orders . They slipped from the mooring ahead of a freshening breeze , with Beasley nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short distance in their own craft  --  a dugout canoe , fitted with a crude sail , which had been nested in the canebrake . Running upstream in the slack water along the bank , Yulee took his vessel into a sharp tack , to enter the river channel at a point above the bluff . John felt the worst of his fears dissolve when the butternut major , stretching his legs , began to chat as easily as though they had been friends of long standing . The fort had fallen to the English two days ago  --  just how , it seemed , was a military miracle not even the major had grasped too firmly . Their commanding officer had arrived but recently from Pensacola . He had taken a firm hand with the secretly armed forces in Natchez : with Dr. Wright 's permission , he had driven the Spaniards from their bastion with only negligible casualties . Now , acting as representative of his King , this wily warrior wasp113halting all flatboats at cannon point , with the hope of cutting off supplies to New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beasley conceded , was now in Whig hands ( this , as John knew , was the usual label for rebels in Tory areas ) . So far as Beasley was concerned , the enemy might consolidate his conquest and keep the Atlantic seaboard as well , providing the valley stayed English . Eventually , he felt sure , the forces of the rebel General Clark would give up all attempts to maintain a supply line to New Orleans . With the coming of peace , Natchez would be in a position to establish herself as a river queen without rival , including the upstart city to the south . .. . Now and again , as this recital continued , John stole a glance at Faith . It was reassuring to find that the girl was listening with an interest that matched his own . He had suspected that she would face most emergencies with that same aplomb . " Tell me this , Major , " he said , " why were you on the west bank this morning ? " " Routine patrol . Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . Our job 's to make sure they 're collared . " " What of the Spanish garrison at the fort ? Did you make them prisoners too ? " John noted a gleam of caution in Beasley 's eye . " Guess that 's the colonel 's story . " " And who is this paragon from Pensacola ? " Again , the major had the look of a solemn boy guarding a militarysecret . " I 'll let him introduce himself , Doc . " On that note , Beasley composed himself in the bow and looked up proudly at the hill of Natchez  --  a two-hundred-foot bluff , shiningwith burgeoning wild grape and white bursts of dogwood . Already , this massif had begun to cast its shadow on the smooth flow of the river . At closer view , the tumbled roofs of the shacks along the water were even less imposing than they had seemed from the western bank ; Natchez was revealed as an outsize village thatp114had somehow managed to cling to this muddy lip of land , despite the threat of flood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its summit , the bluff seemed untouched by human hand . It made a bizarre naturalmonument in the flatlands that surrounded it ; from this angle , it was impossible to pick out the plantation rooftrees that had stood out so boldly at a distance . Only the frowning palisade of the fort was visible , and the black-nosed cannon wailing to challengethe next flatboat that swept into their sights . Evidently their coming had been witnessed . John observed a corporal 's guard awaiting them  --  a half-dozen men in homespuns whose discipline was in startling contrast to their garb . Beasley accepted their present arms with an acceptable salute and stepped up to the rickety pier he had selected as a mooring . With John in the van , and Faith clinging to his arm , the processionbegan the steep climb to the fort . " Do n't worry , Faith , " he whispered . " These fellows must play hero until the novelty wears off . We 've a straight story , and nothing to hide . " " Do I look afraid ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enjoying this . " Fort Panmure was a primitive bastion indeed . A palisade of pine and cedar logs , vaguely circular in shape , was buttressed by a terreplein for the gun mounts . The terreplein sloped to a constrictedparade , flanked by barracks and the commandant 's quarters . These were mere log cabins , cheerful with cook fires and the rough male laughter of farmer militia . Yet discipline seemed sharp , for all the horseplay . The sentries that patrolled the riverside were alert as hawks as they scanned the Mississippi for fresh plunder . The guards at the commandant 's doorsill crossed muskets with a precision worthy of the London Horse Guards . Major Beasley emerged in a moment with a beetle-browed aide in tow , and presented the latter with a flourish . " Colonel Larkin , Doctor . " The newcomer was a humpbacked giant in a uniform thatp115strained at every button . Both the once bright tunic and its wearer had an air of costume about them . John suspected that Larkin was a relic of England 's last long conflict with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed him in a parade-ground bellow grown rusty from disuse . " You 'll forgive us if this detention is unwarranted , Doctor  --  and my best compliments to your lady . But I need n't remind you that England 's at war . " Larkin frowned but briefly at the passport John offered , though his eyebrows lifted as he noted the New Orleans custom stamp . Nor did he seem to listen with more than half an ear as John detailedthe story of their upriver journey , and his intention to visit the Wrights . " Stay a moment more  --  I 'll see if our commandant can give you an audience , " he said . " Ned , get the lady a chair . " Beasley had barely time to carry out this request when Larkin was back . Whatever had transpired inside the cabin was clearly in John 's favor . Larkin all but swept the dust with his moldy tricorneas he stepped aside to let him enter . " The commandant will talk to you now . Colonel Martin , may I present Dr. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with maps and papers . He was wearing a new officer 's coat with the double epaulettesof a colonel ; even without this item of apparel , John would have recognized the man who had capered so gleefully on the ramparts . The coat was open to the last button , revealing the wearer 's magnificent , bull-like chest  --  and the fact that he wore nothing beneath it , save a pair of farmer 's breeches . But there was no escaping the former sutler 's authority . The bark he offeredp116Larkin was enough to send that aged warrior scurrying , in his eagerness to leave the two men alone . " Welcome to Natchez , Doc , " said Chris . " I sort of figured you 'd turn up here in time . " Ever since he had quitted Pensacola , John had forgotten the sutler 's existence entirely  --  along with the sly offer he had made there . Now that they stood facing each other in Fort Panmure , he could still hardly believe what he saw . " Do n't tell me you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complete with commission , " said Chris genially . " Like to read it ? " John glanced at the sheet of foolscap the sutler tossed across the desk . He had examined a hundred such documents , and knew it was genuine enough . The Great Seal of Britain embossed the signature of Brigadier General Campbell , the representative of His Majesty in West Florida . With the usual rhetorical flourish , the paper informed all and sundry that Christopher Martin was hereby appointed colonel and leader of such volunteer inhabitants as he could procure to serve under his command . " Did General Campbell send you here ? " " That he did . He figured a ruckus in de Galvez 's back yard was just what this war needed . I know the Creek country , so he made me his courier . " Chris had been sent from Pensacola , then ( probably at the moment the town was put under siege ) , to deliver commissions to all those in Natchez loyal to King George . At least it explained Beasley 's shambling but effective force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell himself had signed the order elevating Chris to command  --  though it seemed far more likely that Chris had forged his own commission during his journey . But John kept this surmise to himself . " You 've done well as a soldier , " he observed . " Well enough , " said the brand-new colonel . " If you were capturedby Beasley , you 'll have the story . He 's gabby enough . "  | " I 'd rather listen to your version , Chris . How did you reach Natchez ? " " Campbell sent me to the mouth of the Pearl River in a fast sloop . The Indians paddled me upstream to Red Bluff  --  and I cut across country from there . " John nodded . Such a journey , while hazardous , was feasible enough for a trained woodsman . " I gather it 's you who trained the militia ? " " I 'll take most of the credit . Old Larkin helped . So did Doc Wright . " " Who persuaded the fort to surrender ? " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the dons had been chewing their cuds here  --  with the Wrights ' militia gettingmeaner each day . Second , I had a piece of luck on the trail . Picked up a Choctaw chief I know  --  fellow named Red Shoes , with a fair-size hunting party , heading home for the Yazoo country . Persuaded ' em to camp under the bluff awhile , and make a powwow --  " Again , John found he was nodding in grudging admiration . " Do n't tell me you used Indian allies ? " " Not all the way . Those powwow drums were enough . All that time , you understand , we were deploying around the fort , and bringing up fieldpieces . Two days ago , I figured we sounded mad enough . So I sent in a message , saying we 'd tunneled through the bluff , and were ready to blow the palisade to hell  --  before I sent in two hundred braves with tomahawks . " " And they believed you ? " " They 'd been penned in a long time  --  and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a few shots  --  but my boys had picked off a dozen of their sentries , neat as squirrels . A bit of cannonading from the woods finished the persuasion . " Chris chuckled at the picture he was drawing . " ' Course I turned generous when they asked for surrender terms . Let ' em march out with their colors , once they 'd stacked their arms . I even gave ' emp118the first batch of flatboats we captured , so they could go cry on the Governor 's shoulder . " The stratagem was complete now . In his mind 's eye , John could see the defeated garrison slinking downstream in the dark ; he could hear de Galvez 's bellow when he learned of the shabby but effective ruse that had forced his troops to surrender . As an item in the grand pattern of frontier war , such a defeat could prove decisive . It might even permit Campbell to strike at New Orleans , in conjunction with British forces already in Georgia and the Carolinas . Yet John 's mind refused to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force that had seized it , were problems the Spanish Governor would settle later . " You might congratulate me , Doc . " John came back to Chris Martin with a frown . The story of the Battle of Natchez was clear enough . But he could not yet believe the part the ex-sutler had played . " One question more , " he said . " What 's your profit in this busi-ness ? " " Look over that parapet , Doc . Count the flatboats we 've bagged . I 've two warehouses splitting their sides with plunder , and more to come each day . So far , we 're calling it the spoils of war . But do n't tell me the citizens of Natchez wo n't vote me my cut . " " What happens when Pensacola falls ? " " Doc Wright is willing to take that gamble . Why should n't I go along ? " " Knowing you , I can see no reason at all . " " What d' you mean by that ? " For the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembered , all too vividly , that Chris Martin was in absolute command here . Clearly ( since Chris had the power to smash him beyond repair , with a single order ) he could be goaded just so far . " Keep your temper , " he told the sutler . " I 'm neither a spy nor an informer . I do n't belittle your military genius for a moment . But I do happen to be fresh from New Orleans . My information 's more complete than yours . "  |p119Chris  listened in a kind of sullen aloofness while John told the story of his meeting with de Galvez and the message he had brought . " Sorry , Doe , " he growled . " I do n't scare that easy . " " Do you object to my delivering this threat to Dr. Wright ? " " Say what you like . You 'll find him twice as brave as me . But I 'd advise you to hold your tongue . You 've a good reason for cominghere . Keep your mouth shut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sutler was still scowling , but John risked another prod . " Be honest , Chris . Do you think Natchez can hold out ? " " We can last until Pensacola falls . By that time , anything can happen . Clinton and Campbell may move in from the east . We could take New Orleans together . " " Perhaps you can sell that brand of opium to the Wrights . But you must know you ca n't wound a Spaniard in his pride and sur-vive . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " It 's only a question of time before de Galvez comes upriver for his revenge . When that happens , it 'll be easy enough for you to fade from the picture . What happens to the Wrights  --  and the others who have roots here ? " " Damn it all , they asked me to take the fort . Doc Wright blessed the attack --  " " I 'm not reproaching you . Just answer my question . " " Roots or no roots , " said Chris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you do believe me ? " " ' Course I do . I do n't doubt de Galvez will stage a lynching bee here , if he 's able . He 's well within his rights . " " And yet you picked off his sentries , and took the fort . " Chris shrugged . " All right , Doc , " he said belligerently . " I 'm here to line my pockets  --  and there 's many another on both sides who 'll do the same . But you need n't call me a coward ; I 'm taking my chances , too , along with this clutch of Britishers . And I 'll tell you more . If the Governor does come calling , I 'll lead ' em to safety . Can I say it fairer than that ? "  |p120There  was something disarming about Chris Martin , even when the scoundrel was closest to the surface . " That 'll do nicely , for now , " John told him . " Do I have your permission to call on the Wrights ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just do n't upset the old man with too many cold facts . Remember he 's a real patriot . The genuine article , if I make myself clear . " John could not avoid smiling , as he paused in the doorway . " And how would you define the genuine article , Colonel ? " " A man who wo n't let go till it thunders , " said Chris . " A man who wo n't surrender , never mind the odds . In this war , you 'll find most of that breed are Whigs . This one 's a Tory , more 's the Pity . " The sandy Trace , winding north and east from- the Natchez bluff , seemed more a prehistoric ditch than a formal road , though the light gig in which they were riding bounced easily along the ruts . Notched into the verdant forest that hemmed it , muflled in cascading masses of laurel and wild grapevine , it had a strange beauty of its own . John could almost believe that it had been carved here by some superhuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major Beasley ( flicking a lazy whip as the gig eased downhill toward open farmland ) was explaining that this portion of the Trace had once been a buffalo wallow , then an Indian trail . At present , it marked the beginning of the only well-marked path across the virgin wilderness . Its other terminus was Nashville , and the settlements on the Ohio . Generations of flatboatmen had used it as a practical , if highly dangerous , route for their homeward journey , once they had left their cargoes at Natchez or New Orleans.  |p121Faith  and John , seated beside their garrulous driver , were quite content to let his voice drone on . Yulee followed them in a buckboard , with their portmanteaux and other gear . " You 'll see Trail 's End in a moment , Doc . It 's a sight worth waiting for . " " Trail 's End ? " said Faith . " Surely that 's a rather special name for a plantation house . " " Blame it on Mrs. Wright , " said Beasley with a grin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Tis n't just because the Wrights ' land marks the end of the Trace , more or less . She was hoping the doctor had seen the end of their own wanderings when they built here . " " How long have they lived in Natchez ? " " More than ten years now , if I remember rightly . Leastways , it was the year I brought my own brood out of Carolina . Larl:in 's been here almost that long ; so have a few others you 'll be meeting . Those are the nabobs  --  though it 'd be fair to call ' em pioneers too , since they came in on the heels of the French . Most of ' em had land grants straight from London . All of ' em are rich enough to keep slaves . " John glanced at the plowmen working a strip of cleared land beside the Trace . To his surprise , they were white , to the last man  --  lanky fellows of Beasley 's own cut , who raised a shout of greeting as the gig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes and no . Some of ' em have a few acres . Mostly they 're farmerswho moved west ahead of the rebel armies . Those you just saw are ' croppers , breaking ground for the Wrights . The old doctor'sgiven ' em asylum till the war 's over . " " Dr. Wright sounds like a good Samaritan . " " He 's that , all right , " Beasley said heartily . " And a Croesus to boot , I might add . Enough in London to outlast any wind that blows . Land in East Florida , and land in the Old Dominion . ' Course the Whigs have taken most of that  --  but there 's plenty left.  |p122He  's lived in all those spots I mentioned , until he could n't stand the politics . They say he came here for his health . " With each turn of the wheels , the road was opening to bright vistas of cotton fields , foaming with the green of spring . At first glance , the Wrights ' land seemed to sweep nearly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than a few acres had actually been cleared for planting ; but it was apparent from the fire lanes in the encroaching forest that Evan Wright had staked out a vast preserve as his own . His home , rising on a hill in the very center of this domain , gave the scene its focus and its gracious meaning . Trail 's End , John saw , was a classic plantation house  --  redbrick , hip-roofed , with a two-story portico on its western face , framed in square white columns . Yet there was nothing formidable about this pleasant abode . Trail 's End was simply a part of that landscape , like the camellia bushes that softened the long rectangleof its eastern wing , the massed scarlets of the azaleas along its driveway . The house belonged to these rich acres , as inevitablyas the slaves in the rose garden that dropped in gentle'terracesto a pond reflecting the bright blue of the Natchez sky . Red brick was an almost unheard-of luxury three hundred river miles north of New Orleans  --  hut Trail 's End was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan boldly : his house was a visible proof of the enterprise that had put those fields to cotton , a crop that was only beginning to prove its value in the world market . Yet Trail 's End was down-to-earth , for all its aura . As the gig rolled up the drive , John saw that each window was fitted with its iron shutter ; behind the kitchen wing , the whitewashed quarters of the slaves were bricked as solidly as the main dwelling . Natchez ( expanding in the sun like a confident giant ) was still mindful of its last Indian attack  --  and stood ready to repel invaders . Beasley 's whip pointed to the forest-bound horizon . " Yonder 's the Rodell chimneys  --  Alvin Rodell put down his foundations the year after the Wrights . And that 's Poling Hall on the next rise.  |p123You  wo n't see many mansions , this far upriver : the war 's slowed down building , but these folks will own the world , when Natchez comes into its own . " " Providing they 've bet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that again , Doc ? " " Did these neighbors join the attack on the fort ? " " That they did n't , now you mention it  --  and more 's the pity . Both families boarded up solid , and took off for other parts . " Beasley gave a short and bitter laugh . " If you ask me , they 're lucky not to be burned to the ground . " John heard this news with no real surprise : from the oldest street in Boston to the farthest limits of the backwoods , the American rebellion had set brother against brother , clan against clan . Though Natchez was a Loyalist hotbed , he could well believe that there were dissenters here as well  --  malcontents who would gladly cheer any blow against British power , or plain do-nothings who refused to risk their whole future on a concept as nebulous as King George and England . " Where are they now  --  stirring up trouble in New Orleans ? " " Not Alvin , Doc  --  he 's too good a businessman to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit as shrewd . My guess is they 're holed up in some backwoods cabin  --  trusting de Galvez will hear they were n't on hand when the fight started . " Though his manner was still cheerful , there was a furrow in the butternut major 's brow when he tossed his reins to a house slave . " Reckon I 'm giving you folks too many facts , " he said . " You 'll find the old doe 's a better explainer . You can go straight through to the back gallery ; he 'll be waiting for you there . " Faith glanced down at her boyish garb , as though her surroundingshad shocked her back to a sense of propriety . " If you do n't mind , John , " she said , " I 'll face no more strangers until I 've changed my clothes . " A black major-domo was already bowing them up to the portico . From the corner of his eye , John saw that a pair of house slaves ,  |p124in  the same canary-yellow livery , had come forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me we 're staying here , Major ? " Beasley laughed aloud . " The Wrights wo n't let you stay anywhere else . Your room 's been ready , ever since I sent word from the fort . " " In that case , " said Faith , " I 'll go up and change . My husband will explain to Dr. Wright , I 'm sure " Even in her incongruous garb , she managed to look every inch the lady as she swept through the tall , plain-paneled doorway and ascended the spiral of stair well beyond . The Wrights ' butler led the way with episcopal dignity ; the house slaves followed with the baggage . John , since he had no choice , walked with Beasley down the long , sun-shot hallway that divided the formal rooms of Trail 's End into two equal segments . The proportions of the interior were designed to soothe both eye and spirit . A magnificent Adam mirror welcomed the visitor from an overmantel of fruited Italian marble . Ancestors , in ritual poses , looked down from cool wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of a baronial library . To the right , an archway opened to a double parlor with recessed window boxes and furniture that could have come only from Paris . John could picture the labor required to bring those mahogany pieces from the New Orleans levee after their Atlantic voyage , the bribes that had changed hands before that marble could leave its Italian hillside . It was evident that the Wrights felt the bribes well spent  --  if only to prove that civilization could plant its banner on the Natchez bluff . He discovered his host on the rear gallery of the house . Evan Wright sat in an old-fashioned horsehair rocker , with his eyes on a cherry laurel that had just burst into bloom on the lawn . Viewed against that background , the master of Trail 's End seemed secure as time : only the blanket that covered his knees and the cameosharpprofile of the man himself suggested his frailty . John neededp125but a glance at his host 's almost translucent skin , the spots of red on each cheekbone , to divine the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that sun-warmed gallery , no hint of weakness in Evan Wright himself . The hand he offered John was firm with purpose . The eyes were bright with a spirit that transcended the fever within . " This is a pleasure too long deferred , Dr. Powers . Wo n't you sit here beside me ? Ned wo n't mind ringing for London . " Settled in an armchair , feeling the benison of the river breeze , John fought hard against an irrational conviction that this wisp of humanity was already a friend of long standing . Evan Wright is like his wife , he thought  --  serene in his belief that most men are brothers , positive of his own essential rightness . A nabob and a gentleman , in short  --  rolled into one neat package . . . . John smiled inwardly at the conceit . He had met his share of purseproudaristocrats ; he had known gentlemen in both rags and satin . This was his first encounter with wealth and humility , in the same person . " I hope you 've come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your interview in Pensacola . " " I 've yet to settle anywhere for long , Dr. Wright . " " Yet you 've come to us , just as we hoped you would . With a bride on your arm , to make sure you 'll put down roots . " London ( the major-domo who had admitted them ) had already appeared with brandy and Madeira , and a cedar box fragrant with Havana segars  --  a luxury John had first sampled on his arrivalin West Florida .. A draught from a decanter , joined to the aroma of the well-cured leaf , helped to bring his situation into perspective  --  including the picture of Natchez , which his host continued to paint in glowing colors . " Believe me , Dr. Powers , this river valley is the land of tomorrow ; with England behind us , we ca n't fail to prosper here . We 'd only wither under the hand of Spain ; that 's why we 've risked everything to take the fort --  " The elder doctor had half risen from his chair , only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coughing . " Once more , you must forgive me for not rising . I 've had a rather protracted siege of illness this spring . But I did want to indicate the extent of my landhold . It will help to drive home my point . " " I 've already seen much of your estate , sir . " " The view is better from this gallery . Show him , Ned . You know the landmarks . " John moved to the rail with Beasley : Evan Wright continued to speak from the armchair , as though he were consulting a map he knew by heart . " To the north , beyond that clump of cedars , my grant adjoins the Polings ' . Now , if you 'll count five fire lanes to the south , you 'll see where it ends . To the west , it extends to the bluff . Twelve thousand acres in all  --  the gift of my sovereign . Can I do less than save it for England ? " " Are you the largest landholder in Natchez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan Wright . " At the moment , I 'm the largest in residence . Most of our plantations have gone fallow until the political situation resolves itself . Not all of the larger owners have cared to share the burden we assumed when we captured Fort Panmure . " John settled on the veranda rail , and stared down at his brandy . " I gather you felt the burden worth assuming ? " " It was a time for boldness , Dr. Powers  --  and we were fortunate in our field commander . Colonel Martin assures me that we can hold our position , until General Campbell sends help . " This , John noted , was a somewhat different version of the story Chris had told at the fort . He continued to hold his tongue , unwilling , as yet , to spoil the ambitious picture his host was drawing . " I gather that Colonel Martin has been most resourceful ? " " He has indeed , Dr. Powers . I ca n't honor him too highly . " " May I ask how this attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is composed of King 's men . Are all of them in your employ ? " " In a sense , I suppose . Look a bit farther  --  across that gully , between the stand of cypress and the bluff . You 'll see another thousand acres of the finest bottom land in North America . That , too ,  |p127was  part of my grant from England . I 've parceled it among lit IN sharecroppers and their families  --  on condition they help clear my own land , and assist in my experiments with cotton and other staples . Naturally , they form the nucleus of our militia , and 1 undertook to supply them with arms . " " Are all these tenant farms the same ? " " Some are larger than others , depending on the family 's size . Ned here has already bought back his land , and added more . So has my old friend and pensioner , Colonel Larkin . But even the smallest of my tenants can hope to be a prosperous landlord tomorrow  --  whenNatchez is really England 's . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't too sanguine a dream ? " " So was the conquest of this continent , Dr. Powers . Surely we 've the right to keep what we won ? " Moses , thought John , could have spoken no more ardently on his descent from Sinai ; in the case of Evan Wright , the promised land was already attained . In every war , it seemed , there were prophets to spell out salvation  --  and others to lead the faithful to their doom . . . . He felt a premonitory chill as he weighed the possibilities before him . It was now all too evident that Chris Martin had fanned an incipient hostility into flame , for purely selfish reasons . It seemed certain that retribution would strike at almost any hour . John shook off the mesmerism of Evan Wright 's rhetoric and spoke out at last , without measuring the effect of his words . " ColonelMartin advised me not to mention this , " he said , " but I feel I must . I bring a warning from Bernardo de Galvez --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " A rather definite warning , I 'm afraid . Will you listen with an open mind ? " Evan Wright smiled . " We 'll do our best , Doctor . " The gallery was still when John had told his story of the meeting in the Governor 's house in New Orleans  --  so still , that the suddensong of a mockingbird seemed an intrusion far beyond itsp128size . Yet Evan Wright 's voice was firm as ever when he spoke again . " Do I take it I 've signed my death warrant , in the Governor 's book ? " " Not only you , Doctor  --  your whole militia company . " " We 're over a hundred strong . Would he damn all of us ? " " I 'm afraid that 's just what he 's done . " " The fort was never really attacked . Colonel Martin captured it by a ruse . " " It was still a military action ; sentries were killed before the surrender . Did the whole command participate ? " " I 'm afraid so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vicinity to supply a list of names ? " " A few  --  more 's the pity . " " Then it 's my duty to repeat the warning : you 'll be hounded to the last man . " " It 's our hope the Spaniards will never return to Natchez . " " What if that hope is mistaken ? " Evan Wright studied the pattern of the blanket across his knees . When he looked up again , his eyes were clear and unafraid . " Would n't you say that was the threat of a desperate man , Dr. Powers ? " " I 'm sure that Governor de Galvez meant every word . What 's more , he 'll be twice as vengeful , now you 've tricked him . " " Colonel Martin thinks differently . " " Colonel Martin is acting under orders . He was sent here to create a diversion . Naturally , he 's done all he could to make the diversion a success . But it 's only a temporary triumph ; Natchez will never stand against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed as well . " " You 're a gloomy prophet , Doctor . " Evan Wright turned to Beasley with the gentlest of smiles . " Do you agree with our visitor , Ned ? "  | " It could happen , just like he says . Remember Bloody O'Reilly in New Orleans ? " Glancing at Beasley , John saw that his story had struck home . The major was pale under his turkey-red tan ; his eyes , rolling uneasily toward the river , seemed to vision a Spanish vanguard , intent on his personal extinction . The farmer turned warrior , it seemed , had a rude grasp of the verities which the doctor-philosopherlacked . " Perhaps it 's unfortunate you did n't arrive earlier , Dr. Powers , " said Evan Wright dryly . " Though I 'm sure none of us would have listened  --  including Ned . " " Fair enough , gentlemen , " said Beasley . " I 'll admit I was hellbentfor a fight , same as the others . I 'll also admit I 'm scared blue today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are your plans ? " " Most of us crossed over from the Carolinas to get here , " said the major . " Reckon we can cross back , if we 're warned in time . Nobody 's neck is itching for a rope . " " And you , Dr. Wright ? " " As the instigator of this affair , I should take my punishment . " " The people would never stand for that , " said Beasley . " If it comes to flight , you 'll go along . Even if we have to hog-tie and carry you . " Evan Wright held up a soothing palm . " Are n't we crossing a great many bridges prematurely , gentlemen ? We 've friends in New Orleans , ready to warn us if Pensacola falls . Until then , I suggest we take what pleasure we can in the conclusion of our little war . " John got to his feet with a sudden resolve filling his brain ; while it lasted , the sense of release was like a weight lifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he agreed . " I 'm sorry if I 've spoiled that pleasure . " " You have n't , Doctor , I assure you . I shall continue to hope our good fortune is permanent . "  | " As you wish . I still felt I should deliver the Governor 's warning . If you 'll excuse me now , I 'll return downriver . " " But you 've only just arrived , " Evan Wright protested . " Now you 're here , we wo n't surrender you so easily . " " As the bearer of bad tidings , I must n't wear my welcome out . Will you convey my compliments to your wife ? " " Why not convey them yourself , Doctor ? " John turned in time to see Stella Wright emerge from the rose garden , with a flower basket on one arm . Behind her , a slave trundled a barrow overflowing with azaleas . The smile she offered them began and ended in her wide blue eyes ; it made him welcome , before she could speak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile ; the greeting she offered him could not be said to go beyond her gracious role as chatelaine of Trail 's End . And yet , John felt a strange surge of emotion as their hands met , a bondage he would never put into words . " So you 've joined us at last , Dr. Powers , " she said . " Do n't think 1 'd lost hope  --  but it 's been a long time . " " Too long , " he said  --  and felt the silken net tighten . It was a pleasant bondage , he reflected , part and parcel of this charming scene , of the peace that enveloped this house and garden like an invisible mantle . Try as he might , he could not avoid a sense of home-coming  --  as though he had been destined to walk into Stella Wright 's world on just such a morning . " You arrived opportunely , my dear , " said Evan Wright . " Already , he 's talking of returning downriver . " " That I 'll not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride . I 've just looked in on her , Doctor  --  and insisted on an extended visit . May I congratulate you on your good fortune ? " John accepted the compliment with a wordless bow . The urge toward flight had been real enough just now . With one gesture of welcome , Stella Wright had made it seem ridiculous  --  the impulse of a schoolboy to avoid an authority greater than his own will . Evan Wright was chuckling in the background . " It seems thep131ladies have mapped out your immediate future , Dr. Powers . It 's a way ladies have . " " Of course he must stay awhile , " said Stella . " In Pensacola , I told him something of what Natchez has to offer a physician . He must see I spoke the truth . " " I can see that now , Mrs. Wright , " said John . " As it happens , I 'm here for another reason . " " Your wife explained that too , " said Stella . " An ultimatum from de Galvez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered , you can think of other things . For example , the soiree I 've planned in your honor . " " Hospitality 's a sacred word here , " said Evan Wright . " The momentwe 'd heard of your arrival , Stella sent notes to a dozen neighbors . Tonight , they 're dining here especially to meet you . Forgive my bluntness , Doctor , but your hands are tied . " " Quite firmly , " said Stella . " And I 'm in no hurry to loosen the knot . Nor is Mrs. Powers . " " Do n't tease him any longer , my dear , " said her husband . " You 'll find him a willing captive , I 'm sure . Especially when he 's gone the rounds with me tomorrow , and seen the medical problems I 'm facing . " Stella had already moved to her husband 's chair ; she let an affectionate hand rest on his shoulder . " Evan tries to do too much . He needs help badly . But I explained that in Pensacola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John over Evan Wright 's shoulder , renewing her welcome with no further need of words . He permitted that unspoken bond to tighten still further . Already , he was beginning to understand her a little . The affection she was giving him now ( and affection was hardly too strong a term ) was part of her love for all the world . Like her husband 's acceptance , it offered the home and hearth he had never known , the chance to find himself on his own terms . It was a far cry , he thought , from the dark compulsionsthat had brought him here : only a boor could fail to meet such warmth halfway.  | " I 'd be glad to  --  make the rounds , " he said slowly . " In that case , Evan , " said Stella , " I 'll rest on my laurels . If you gentlemen will excuse me , I 'll arrange the flowers . " She bestowed a final smile on John as she beckoned to the waiting slave . " Trail 's End is prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special occasion . " " Faith studied her face in the huge oval mirror above the dressing table , and treated her red-brown tresses to a dusting from the atomizer she had bought in New Orleans . The silk print she was wearing ( a watermelon green , with an overlay of gold net ) had come from a boutique in that same town . So had the hoop earrings and the high-heeled silver slippers , already tapping impatientlyin response to the harp music that had begun to drift up the stair well . Watching her preen herself , John continued totake his ease the chaise longue across the room . He could enyiythe. lu. of a thoughtful pause before launching into his argument anew . A measure of calm had descended on his mind after a long siesta . Now , stretching in the comfort of the cushions , he could tell himself that he had been overstrained this morning  --  that his encounter with the Wrights had never really gone beyond the bounds of hospitality , the genius for welcome for which the South was famous . True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he could still depart when he chose . . . . Faith 's problem , of course , was quite different  --  and he meant to solve it tonight . " Even if I should stay awhile to help Dr. Wright , " he said , " you 'd be safer in New Orleans . " " I feel safe here , John . Safe enough to suit me , at any rate . " " I 've said we could divide our cash . Yulee will stay on as yourp133personal servant , after he 's sailed you downriver . You can wait out the war in comfort ; afterward , you can do as you like . " " But I 'm doing what I like right now . " He kept his temper : he had expected her to be stubborn . " I 've told you what will happen here , when Pensacola falls . " " You could be wrong . " " It is n't like you , Faith  --  refusing to face facts . " " Natchez does n't seem in danger now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Martin for a brassbound adventurer ! " He found that he had just escaped shouting , and lowered his voice . " And a special damnation for all visionaries who dream of Utopia . " " That 's a poor way to speak of Dr. Wright . You just said he 's one of the finest men you know . " " He 's also an idealist who 's been taken in rather badly . And I 'll never prove I 'm right until it 's too late . When that time comes , I want you out of harm 's way . " " Stella is n't afraid , " said Faith . She opened her jewel case and clamped on a bracelet blazing with paste diamonds . " Why should I turn tail , just because you 've moved the Spanish my into the Wrights ' back yard ? " " Believe me , Faith , that 's just where they 'll be . " " Suppose you 're wrong ? You 'd make me look like a coward . If you 're right , our hosts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped on pillows , John continued to study Faith in the mirror . This was not the first time he had been shocked by her prescience . He was glad now that she had not witnessed his reunionwith Stella . " Very well , " he said . " Suppose I do remain here  --  serve as Dr. Wright 's assistant while his illness lasts --  " " You know he 's dying of consumption . " " It 's all too likely , I 'm afraid . Still , he might rally . " " But he wo n't be active much longer . You can be the first doctorin Natchez . Is n't that what you 're really after ? " Faith 's voice had been innocent as her manner  --  but John was134certain that the appraisal in the mirror was a two-way game . He took one of Evan Wright 's segars to the tall French window that opened directly to the upstairs gallery . " Naturally it 's an attractive prospect , " he admitted . " It 's also a hopeless dream  --  if the Spaniardstake Natchez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands will be clean . You can still practicehere . " " These people are now open enemies of Spain . The moment de Galvez moves upriver , they must run for their lives . " " And what if they do , John ? You 'll be in no more danger than the back-country Whigs  --  or the ones who stood aside . " " You 're suggesting I settle here as Dr. Wright 's assistant , " he said stiffly . " If I decide on that course , I can hardly help taking sides . " " " Sympathy for a business partner is one thing , " said Faith . " Riskingyour life for him is quite another . " " Did n't you just say the Wrights would need friends , if trouble comes to Natchez ? " Still at the mirror , Faith lifted nut-brown shoulders in a philosophicalshrug , and pinned a brilliant to her decolletage . " I 've admitted I make friends easily . Just because I 'd like to help the Wrights does n't mean you must play follow the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetuous gesture , letting his fingers caress her shoulders as he met her eyes in the mirror . " I 'm afraid that 's just what I 'd do , Faith , " he said . " If I linger beyond tonight , that is . Once I sign on with Evan Wright , I 'll probably stay to the end . " " Then we 're in this together , " she said . " Were you testing me just now , by any chance ? " he asked , with a rueful grin . " Of course . May I add that you passed my first test with flying colors ? " " Will there be others ? " " Of course there will . Shall we go downstairs before dinner is served ? " Natchez 135 " Tell me what you mean . " " I could n't , so soon . Ask me tonight , when the party 's over . " She rose from the dressing table on that , and left the room  --  so quickly that he was forced to lengthen his stride to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw at once that they had lingered too long over their dressing . The hallway below was filled with guests . Some of the visitors had already begun to sample the prodigal buffet over which a half-dozen aproned house slaves presided . Knowing that eyes were upon them , he produced his husbandly smile . Colonel Larkin , wearing a frogged dress coat of the British Army , strutted forward to escort them to the front parlor , where the Wrights were still receiving latecomers . It was easy enough to drop back a pace , while Faith and that slightly fustian warrior conversedamiably . It was easier still to let his mind slip into a pleasantbut dangerous reverie  --  the Whigs ' rebellion ended , Natchez still firmly in Loyalist hands , and Stella Wright 's husband already in a hero 's grave . . . . The unworthy fancy died when he glimpsed his host , receiving his guests from an armchair , with an urbanity that transcended his illness . Bending above Stella 's hand in apologyfor his tardiness , he could wonder why Faith had planted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater tests to come . Receiving introductions right and left , accepting the welcome of the good Englishmen of Natchez with a heartiness he knew was adequate , John took command of his vagrant fancies . For this evening , at least , he would only observe . Later , he could plot his future course  --  and Faith 's . To keep his defenses steady , he plunged deliberately into a discussion of the force at Chris Martin 's disposal : his informants were Captains Page Hammond and Ralph Otis , a pair of dashing uniformedfigures tonight , but Natchez planters in less martial times . As he had surmised , the former sutler had little more than a hundred men under his command . Larkin was rated officially as his adjutant . Ned Beasley ( with a foot in both the slave-owning and the tenant-farmer worlds ) had been a natural choice as battalionAdp136major . So far , the battalion contained but two full companies , underHammond and Otis . There were other plantation owners , he learned , eager to commanda company ( most of them , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a would-be officer drilled in the ranks , if only to swell the two companies to full strength . There was no doubting the fiery loyalty of each guest at Trail 's End . But it was just as true ( from what John learned ) that the turnout of King 's men in the Natchez country had been far below expectation . Chris Martin himself ( and John noted this fact with wry detachment ) was conspicuously absent tonight ; duties at the fort prohibitedhis attendance at the gala welcome of a new doctor to Natchez . There was no mistaking the fact that these duties were genuine . Outside , the whole valley was bathed in moonlight . From time to time , the boom of cannon from the bluff was a reminder that the commandant was taking full advantage of good hunting weather . Faith , laughing on Colonel Larkin 's arm , seemed to be enjoying herself thoroughly ; when the first cotillion was formed after supper , no lady in that long double parlor was more graceful than she . The cotillion was followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after that dance ended , there was a general exodus to the lower gallery , where fruit punch was being poured . Beyond , the moonlight created its own magic above the rose gardenand the file of cherry laurels . It seemed oddly natural to be strolling here with Stella Wright . " Be honest , Doctor . You know you 're here to stay . " " You 're a persuasive planner , Mrs. Wright , " he said . " Do all your plans come true ? " " Call me Stella , now you 've gone in with Evan . " " But I have n't , yet . " " You will , John . You ca n't help yourself . He needs someone likeyou so badly . And there 's no limit to what Natchez can offer you . " For another dangerous moment , he let the reverie that hadp137claimed his mind in the drawing room return once more . It was much easier to believe with Stella beside him , wide blue eyes pleading , lips soft with concern . " Faith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  or me ? " " What can I say but yes , Stella ? " he asked with a smile . " You promise readily , John Powers . Do you mean it ? " Was she more than her husband 's advocate at this moment ? Until today , the revenge he had planned in Pensacola had been his evil star ; the thought that it might be effected more easily than he had dared to hope would have brought a surge of satisfaction . Stella Wright was far younger than her husband  --  and an invalidwas no proper mate for a woman in full flower . Yet he could take no joy tonight in the conviction that this flower was his for the taking . " Please , John  --  do n't disappoint us . " " I trust I 'll never disappoint you , Stella . " He looked deep into her eyes , hoping that the words expressed his real meaning . Someone was calling his name from the gallery , and he heard himself answer the hail . Stella laughed gaily , and tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming you for the next reel , " she said . " She 'll complete my persuasion . " " I 'm sure she will , " he replied  --  and led his hostess toward the music with something akin to relief . John remembered little more of the evening  --  the badinagewith other partners , the solemn toasts he drank to the Englishcause as the uniformed squires called for horses and carriages , and lifted a stirrup cup before riding forth in the moonlight . Evan Wright had retired early , before the slaves began to snuff out thep138downstairs candles ; Stella , after saying good night to the last of her guests , had slipped away to attend her husband , without furtherteasing . He smoked another of his host 's segars in the gallery after Faith had gone upstairs , to give her time to undress  --  but she was still in the closet behind the mirrored doors of her armoire when he entered their bedroom . " I 'll be ready in a moment , " she called . " Smoke if you like ; there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final segar , he put it down unlighted . When Faith emerged from the dressing room , demure as ever in her quilted peignoir , he was lying on the chaise longue , still fully dressed . " Well , my dear ? " he asked . " Is Natchez all you hoped ? " " Natchez is everything I hoped for , " she said quietly . " So was the Wrights ' party . " " You acquitted yourself well . " " Perhaps that was because I enjoyed it so thoroughly , " she told him , in that same light tone . " I wish I could say as much for you . " The thrust brought him bolt upright on the settee . " What do you mean ? " " You 're still troubled by something , John . Whatever it is , I wish I could help . " " You could go downriver , as I suggested . " " It has nothing to do with me . Why pretend it does ? " " Ca n't I be concerned for your welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mirror . Now she turned to face him . " Stella told me something I did n't know until tonight . About her brother in Pensacola . The one who prosecuted you at your trial . " " Must we talk of him now ? " " He won the money from the man who was really guilty , did n't he ? " " He did , Faith . But it 's something I ca n't prove  --  something I 've put behind me now . " " Are you so sure of that ? "  |p139He  stretched full length on the settee again , if only to avoid meeting her eyes : he knew how clearly they could see , when she was in a divining mood . " I 'm sure now , Faith , " he said . " In New Orleans , I guessed that something besides the need for work was driving you to Natchez . Was n't it really a desire for revenge  --  in some way involving Stella Wright ? " " It 's your story , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand at finishing it . " " No one can help you , if you wo n't help yourself , " she said . He risked a glance at her then . All at once , he understood the real reason for his fear . This was no longer the scared girl he had faced in Mobile . Somewhere along the way , she had lost the dewy innocence that is the hallmark of youth . Tonight , a lovely , selfpossessedwoman had taken the place of the upcountry jenny  --  a woman who could dance and flirt with Natchez ' finest  --  a woman whose Buick , darting mind was far too nimble to suit his selfesteem . " Be curious if you must , " he said . " You 've every right . " " Not curious , John  --  concerned . " " About yourself ? Did n't I offer to send you to safety , with half of everything I own ? " " About you , my dear . After that night in New Orleans , you must know why . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't deserve it . " " But you do know I 'm in love with you ? " " Not too deeply , I hope . " " Deeply enough to stop you from hurting Stella Wright  --  if I can . " " Are n't you assuming a great deal ? " His voice was harsh , but his anger was more for himself than her . As always , she had put her finger squarely on the cause of his discontent . " Ca n't you see that you must n't , John ? That you 'd only end by hurting yourself ? " Had she been the voice of his own conscience , she could not have stated his plight more clearly . He could not quite force him/self to meet her eyes . He spoke regardless , lest his silence damn him beyond repair . " Have n't I told you that I 'd do my best to help both Dr. Wright and Stella ? " " Is that because you 've given up your revenge ? Or are you already in love with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , " he said . " It is n't hard to love her a little in return . " " Is it possible to love a little , John ? You ca n't move into love by degrees . The water 's too deep for that . Deep and cold and frightening  --  if you must swim there alone . " He saw that she was crying quietly , as she continued to brush her hair with long , rhythmic strokes ; no matter what the risk , he felt an irresistible urge to comfort her . Before the urge left him , he yielded to it  --  moving to stand behind her as she continued to sit before the mirror , and drawing her into a light embrace . Though she neither resisted nor yielded , Faith seemed to melt in his arms . Then , with a sudden , impulsive motion , she freed herselfand moved to the open French window , to stare down at the Mississippi  --  beginning to cloud , now , with the promise of rain . " Think your future through , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . He told me as much tonight at dinner . Already , you 've won his confidence , and Stella 's . If you take over his practice and care for him in his last years , you 'll be his logical heir . Why should n't Stella marry you one day ? " " So that 's my story , " he said . " Complete with happy ending . What 's yours ? " " I do n't know , John , " she said quietly . " Perhaps I was a fool to come this far . And a greater fool to stay a moment more . But I refuse to leave until you 've made up your mind , once and for all . " " Do n't look too far into the future , " he warned her . " It is n't alwayswise . " " You 're right , of course , " she said . " Not when the picture 's so clear  --  and so logical . "  |p141All  of his anger was gone now . He could only feel sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice her own happiness for his . Of course , there was a simple answer to her reproaches , and it was on the tip of his tongue to make it now . He had only to offer to take her before a Natchez magistrate in the morning  --  to make the fiction of their marriage real . It was no more than such loyalty deserved . At least it would put an end to his own doubting . He had half turned , with the avowal already on his lips , when Faith spoke again . " Do n't say it , John --  " " Can you read my mind tonight ? " " I can read it well enough , " she said . " Whatever I may want from you , it is n't pity . And I wo n't be an escape  --  for something you do n't want to face . " " But , Faith --  " " We 've said too much now , " she told him . " There 's no need to say more . But I think we understand one another  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that , to go into the dressing closet ; though she closed the door firmly behind her , there was no hint of rage in the gesture . For an instant he stood staring at his face in the mirroredsurface , while he fought down the urge to continue an argument he had already lost . Faith , as usual , was right , to the last syllable . Only he could write finis to the dilemma he had so far refused to face . She had every right to be present at that moment of decision . Ten minutes later , he was still pacing the carpet of the bedroom  --  and still wondering if Faith was dissolved in tears behind that mirrored panel . He could not deny that the knock on the hall door came as a welcome interruption . Or that he had all but bolted from the room at Major Beasley 's news that he was needed at Fort Panmure for an emergency case.  |p142In  the surgery at the fort , four fish-oil lamps bathed the trestle table in a garish but adequate light . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey between deep-fetched groans , seemed more bear than human at first view  --  a somewhat aged bear , John thought , with a fleck of gray about the muzzle , but a world of power in those long , hair-matted arms . Tossing his cloak aside , he approached the table confidently . He had dealt with men like this in more than one language , and understood them well enough . " Good evening , stranger . Do n't you know better than to argue with a British battery ? " " You need n't have hurried , Doc , " said the riverman . His voice was thick with alcohol , but cheerful enough . " This ai n't the first time I stopped lead . " Once he had stripped aside the rude dressing plastered to the man 's left shoulder , John could see the clean puncture of the bullet , the pump of blood in the depths of the wound . " How did it happen ? " " We come to the bank when they challenged us , meek as lambs . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Colonel Martin , he calls himself . I said he was no better'n a pirate  --  and he drills me . Is that a nice way to run a war ? " John frowned as he turned aside to lay out his instruments . He had left Chris Martin a moment ago , too steeped in brandy to give a coherent account of his latest capture . It was not too difficult to imagine his hair-triggered burst of wrath . " No one else hurt ? " " You bet there was n't , Doc . Word 's already come upriver that they shoot first at Natchez nowadays  --  and argue later . The dons were more polite , once we 'd worked out our bribes . "  |p143John  selected a porcelain-tipped probe from his case , and called Beasley into the room . " Better take another pull on that jug , my friend . Do they have your name at the adjutant 's ? " " Not yet , they have n't : we ai n't on speaking terms . Name 's Hurt . Obadiah Hurt . I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So far , they had been talking around a problem they shared  --  the fact that a leaden pellet , embedded somewhere in the muscle of Obadiah Hurt 's shoulder , must be probed for and extracted at once , if his arm was to be saved . The Kentuckian 's progress towardoblivion was only a means to that end ; John 's banter , so far , had been just as automatic . " Next time , you 'll know better than to run an English gauntlet , " he said . " Stay with that jug . This is going to be painful . " A forcep was ready on the table , in case he found the bullet on the first try ; beside it was a curved elevator , honed almost to the sharpness of a knife , in case the lead had found lodgment in a bone . Known as a " spud " in army surgeries , this useful instrumenthad saved dozens of limbs in John 's medical career . He nodded to Beasley , who moved forward to anchor the patient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soothing hand on the Kentuckian 's arm . " How do you feel now , Obadiah ? " " Drunker'n a owl , Doc . " " Fair enough . Get hold of yourself . " The probe slipped gently into the puckered red mouth of the wound . Working it downward , along the course the bullet had taken , John saw at once that his objective had lodged in bone , or near it , complicating a technique already difficult enough . If only to be sure , he eased the probe even deeper : the porcelain tip grated on lead at last , a solid , jarring sound that made its picture , as accurately as though muscle had been laid bare to the scapula . " Touched it that time , all right , " murmured Obadiah sleepily . " I 'm moving around it now . Steady does it . "  |p144The  porcelain-tipped steel , defining the lodgment of the bullet with a slow , circular motion , might have been an extension of John 's fingertips . On the off-chance that the leaden pellet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wound . The jaws penetrated easily enough , but the bullet refused to budge , since it was impossible to close them firmly . " We 'll have to use the spud , Major . Anchor him as best you can . " The slender arc of metal , entering the wound in its turn , grated upon the bullet  --  a sound that rasped on John 's nerves like the screech of chalk on a blackboard . Sweat beaded his forehead as he strove to dislodge an enemy he could not even see , but he pressed on with all his strength ; Obadiah might have stopped lead before , but this particular threat must be dislodged if the riverman intended to keep his arm . With an abruptness that brought a gasp of relief to the surgeon 's lips , the battered leaden pellet popped into view , like a watermelonseed shot from a child 's fingers . There was a fresh spurt of bleeding , but no real threat of hemorrhage . " ' Bout finished , Doc ? " He came back to the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entire being had been concentrated on the wound and the threat lurking in its depths . Smiling down at Obadiah , John felt a sudden rush of friendship for this man from the other side . True , the operation had been only a routine affair  --  but it had done much to restore his sense of self-respect . Here , at least , he had been master of a situation . " Stay with that bottle , " he advised . " The worst is over . I 'm just making sure that ball did n't carry part of your shirt with it . " Experiencehad taught him long ago that leaving a bit of cloth in a bullet 's track was sometimes as dangerous as leaving the missile itself . With a clean wound , and Hurt 's reservoir of vitality , there would be little chance of pus  --  or the mysterious , stinking-green suppuration that so often followed in the wake of such injuries . John needed only a short exploration to be sure no cloth or buckskin had entered the wound . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly enough to shake the table . Standing back to check his handiwork , the surgeon noddedto Beasley , who relaxed his grip at last . " He 'll sleep till morning , Major . Kentucky whiskey 's a sovereign specific . " " I 'll put the surgery under guard . " John frowned . " Has Colonel Martin made him a prisoner ? " " Those were his orders when we brought him in . Beasley took up his raincape . " The colonel was pretty riled tonight , Doc . Just before he nailed this fellow , a whole flotilla slipped by us , when the moon went under . " " I 'll want him moved to a hospital in the morning  --  if you have one in Natchez . " " We 've got one all right . Made-over farmhouse , on the Trace . I 'll see he 's taken there myself . " Acknowledging the militiaman 's salute outside the surgery , they ran together to the major 's gig . Rain , still pelting heavily from a leaden sky , showed no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gig , laboring in the wet sand of the Trace , seemed forever in reaching the gateposts of Trail 's End . John was about to step out to the columned portico ( where a night light glowed dimly above the doorway ) when Beasley leveled his whip into the streaming darkness . " What d' you know ? The Polings are back . Their place is lighted like a Christmas tree . " John 's gaze followed the pointing whip . The manor house ( withdrawnin its grove of live oaks ) had seemed empty as some abandonedmausoleum when they drove to the fort . Now , a dozen windows blazed with candles  --  a garish glow that seemed all the more bizarre at that hour . Even from the distance , John could make out the silhouettes of the house slaves , as they bustled to make Poling Flail habitable again . " Is it a good sign , Major  --  or a bad one ? " " Too soon to guess , Doe . But if you ask me , they figure the war 's ended  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one foot already on the driveway . The rain beat its mournful tattoo on his cape , but he was oblivious of that chill discomfort . A deeper cold had invaded his blood stream as he weighed the import of Beasley 's words . " Have they returned to count heads for de Galvez ? " " Could be . Or they might have had late word from Orleans  --  and figured it was safe to take down their shutters . " John stared hard at those bright rectangles of light  --  and the windows glared back at him through the rain . Perhaps it was the lateness of the hour , as much as the tensions of this long day . But he had never felt more deeply alone  --  or more uncertain of his next move . The lighted casements of Poling Hall were only an added threat  --  a reminder that forces beyond his control were even now on the move , ready to dictate his future beyond all doubling . " Good night to you , Major , " he said . " Let 's hope their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Beasley , as he drove off into the darkness . Ascending the stairway of Trail 's End , John had expected to drag his feet : he had hardly looked forward to his return to the bedroom he shared with Faith . Strangely enough , he found that he was turning the knob of his door almost willingly . As he had expected , the bed curtains were drawn tightly : Faith 's gentle breathing told him that she was deep in slumber . Tonight , at least , he would have given a great deal for the right to join her there , to lose the worst of his doubts in the haven of her arms . Yet he could still take comfort in her nearness as he lay down on yet another settee to seek what sleep he could . Already , the loneliness that had seemed beyond enduring had vanished , as quietly as a ghost at cockcrow . Give the devil his due , he thought drowsily . I may be trapped between two women  --  and enjoying my captivity . I may find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . There can be no retreating now . Faith and I are part of Natchez.  |p149As  fortnights went , the next interval was the lull before the lightning stroke . Recognizing it for what it was , John found that he could move through the days with no real sense of strain . There was much to occupy him in that time of waiting , once he had taken the load from Evan Wright 's shoulders . Like all settlementsin these latitudes , Natchez had its share of ague and fever in warm weather . In addition , the fort sent a flow of patients to the hospital on the Trace  --  aftermaths of Chris Martin 's piracies , for the most part , plus a few bitings and gougings from the barracks . Most of these cases were salvaged as readily as John had saved Obadiah Hurt . Others died under his knife , or babbled their way to eternity in a fog of opium . The fortunes of war had their ruthless percentages , even at Fort Panmure . Because of these heavy duties , John had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stella were brief indeed , his visits with Faith confined to drowsy talks ( and an occasional spirited argument ) at day 's end . In a way , he welcomed this state of limbo , precarious though he knew it to be . Faith had diagnosed his situationaccurately enough , but there was no need of definite action now . Meanwhile , he waited  --  as did everyone in Natchez  --  for the next move in the chess game downriver . Whatever gambit de Galvez might choose , he would play it in his own fashion , at a time and place of his choosing . John was not sorry when a patient called him to some distant landhold ( on occasion , no more than a clearing in the virgin forestp150that boxed the Natchez bluff ) . Often he took the excuse to make a shakedown bed beside the hearth . If these absences resulted in another sleepless night , he had only himself to blame . Events beyond his control would shape his destiny . There seemed no point in belaboring the question now . Obadiah Hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when he was well enough to ride , he insisted on accompanying John to the backwoods . The Kentuckian soon proved himself a friend , as well as a philosopher of sorts . He had followed most of the trails around Natchez ; between trips to New Orleans , he had kept himself informed on the fast-changing polities of the frontier . After a talk with Obadiah , John could not help feeling that Evan Wright , for all his burnished mind , was a spokesman for yesterday . Obadiah was surely the voice of the future . " It 's our time , Doe , not theirs , " said the Kentuckian . " General Clark holds the west for the Whigs , give or take a few corners . Clinton 's whipped in the East . Lord Cornwallis is sweating every day of the week , and twice as hard on Sundays --  " " Surely England can hold the Floridas . " " East Florida , maybe  --  just to keep a pawn for the peace table . West Florida will belong to Spain when de Galvez puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dons will get the whole thing when the smoke has settled  --  and this river valley , clear to the spot we 're tramping now . " " Do n't say that out loud in Natchez . " " Never you fear . But has n't de Galvez earned as much , after his job of back-stabbing ? " " And what becomes of the Wrights ? " " I could n't say . Would the old doe settle for a nice , dry cell in the Cabildo ? " " De Galvez promised to hang him  --  in my hearing . " " Then he 'll hang  --  if he does n't head for the canebrakes . " " Must you put it so bluntly ? " " A Spaniard 's a Spaniard , Doc . And a King 's man 's , a Tory . How else can I put it ? "  |p151John  shrugged off the query ; in this time of waiting , he could hardly question such earthy wisdom . English pride would never strike its flag to Spain  --  nor would English caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untenable , there was no choice but retreat or death . Augusta ( far upriver on the Savannah ) was the nearest sanctuary  --  and at least five hundred wilderness miles separated that haven from Natchez . Evan Wright grew weaker as the days went by ; John found that he was handling most of the calls that came to Trail 's End . These included appeals for medical aid from Poling Hall  --  or from Rodell 's Bluff , the handsome river plantation that was the Wrights ' southern neighbor . Both houses blazed with light each evening  --  though the owners themselves held aloof . John was positive now that many eyes were fastened on Trail 's End , while Natchez awaited word from New Orleans . He had no doubt whatever that the news would be bad . Why else would these cautious straddlers open their blinds ? More than once ( when he was lancing a boil in the quarters , or setting an arm in the overseer 's house at Poling Hall ) , he all but yielded to the impulse to storm into the mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , common sense had intervened . These prudent landowners were as ignorant of events as he -- though they were convinced the insurgents had lost their gamble . Until that conviction was verified , he would hold aloof  --  serving both camps with what skill he had , and giving homage to neither . When the news came at last , it was no less unsettling , for all the portents that had preceded it . John had been upriver for three days , in Yulee 's sloop , to performa difficult amputation ; until the worst of the aftermath was over , he had not dared to leave the patient . Warping into the pierp152at Rodell 's Bluff ( which served as a landing for Trail 's End ) , he had sensed the change of air before the dock boy could catch his painter . Avoiding the manor house itself , he could feel the stir of defiance within , though the windows were eyeless as ever in the declining day . Obadiah , riding in from the fort when John and Yulee reached the crossroads , brought the latest bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New Orleans via the river trail had reached Evan Wright only a few hours after John 's departure . Already , every Loyalist home on the bluff was astir with preparations for departure as fearful portents wafted upriver . De Galvez , it was said , had assembled a punitive force three thousand strong , using an armada of keelboats and sloops as his transport . Only yesterday , he had been reported at Baton Rouge . A second report ( an hour old ) announced that he was camped a mile downstream , ready to pounce on Fort Panmure . Regardless of his exact whereabouts , there was no doubt that Loyalist heads would soon be falling . A manifesto had announced as much , in blood-chilling terms . ( No one could produce this broadsheet  --  but there were dozens who could quote it verbatim . ) " The old doc is waiting for you now , " said the Kentuckian . " Been asking for you , ever since this song-and-dance began . " " It 's true , then ? " " Pensacola 's gone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't rightly say if the dons have moved their army , so far . But it 's only a question of days before they send callingcards . The Wrights wo n't be here to receive ' em  --  you can lay to that . " So Evan Wright was resigned to the inevitable . John felt a strange pang at his heart . In the old doctor 's book , England had planted her standard on the Mississippi for all time  --  with Natchez as the inevitable nerve center . It had been a stubborn dream , and he had clung to it beyond the bounds of reason . " Take my horse , " said Obadiah . " You 'll find him in his office . " John remembered little of that headlong gallop to Trail 's End.  |p153He  needed only a glance at the faces of the house slaves to catch the note of disaster . Bales and trunks were stacked in the corridors , as though the owners , no longer in residence , had abandonedtheir possessions wholesale . Stripped of their carpets , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already meshed above the tall window frames  --  and ghostly mice dared to squeak behind the baseboards . . . . Though he had spent but little time in the house , John had loved its dignified repose . Today'sdesolation was ominous proof that an era had ended here . He found Evan Wright in his study , at a desk piled high with ledgers , in the act of signing a sheet of foolscap . London stood by to receive this document ; he left on the run , the moment the ink was sanded . The elder doctor offered John no formal greeting ; his voice was as composed as his manner . " Another bill of sale , " he said . " This time , I 'm disposing of the slaves  --  and such gear as Sam Poling will find useful . " John fumbled for words of sympathy that did not come . He had not expected the Wrights to dispose of their Negroes ; the casual announcement had shocked him deeply . " Do n't think I 'm unfeeling , " said the elder doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'm putting their welfare above my own sentiments . Sam will make an excellent master . In my place , would you expose them to the hardships I 'll be facing ? " " You 're selling all of them ? " " All but London . He 's spent his lifetime in my service , and refusesto leave my side . " The master of Trail 's End smiled wanly as he made an entry in the debit column of a ledger . " In the circumstances , I think Sam gave me a fair recompense . Naturally , he wanted the bill of sale in hand at once . " " If Poling is taking your Negroes , why could n't he close the deal himself ? " Evan Wright put down his pen . Though his eyes were kind enough , his voice was wintry . For no valid reason , John felt he was back in Pensacola again , facing a court-martial  --  and a sentencecouched in a tongue he would never really comprehend.  | " Englishmen perform most transactions in the open , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The transfer of my slaves is one of them . " " I 'm afraid I 'm still confused , sir --  " " It 's simple enough , John . I am now persona non grata in Natchez  --  a fugitive , in fact , who must leave the bluff before his neck is stretched . In such circumstances , one does n't meet his neighbors directly . It 's just possible they 'd absorb the taint . " " There must be some way to come to terms with de Galvez . What if you struck your colors ? Or asked for a truce ? " " It 's a bit late for that , I 'm afraid . I 'm cutting my losses , and leaving Trail 's End . " Evan Wright could not have spoken more casually had he been discussing current prices on the New Orleans levee . " Do I gather you can absorb the blow , sir ? " " I 'll tell you a secret , John . Ever since you brought me the Governor 's ultimatum , I 've prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house at an hour 's notice . " " What of the others ? " " Most members of our faction have managed to sell out too . We 're marching at dawn tomorrow  --  with Colonel Martin to guide us . " May I ask your plan ? " " I 've stated it . We must run for our lives . " " Without a formal threat from New Orleans ? " " You 've delivered that threat , John . It is n't your fault that I would n't listen . " " You wo n't consider a white flag ? Or a plea for mercy ? " Evan Wright got to his feet . John was vastly heartened by the spring in the old doctor 's step . Here , surmounting its fragile outer shell , was the spirit that had planted Britain 's banner in every corner of the globe . " I 've found that there are Englishmen willing to live under a different king , " he said . " Whigs are English too , I 'm afraid  --  and I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmanp155with just one sovereign . I 'd die rather than take orders from an-other . " " That 's still your privilege , sir . " " I hope you 're right , John . I must move fast , if I mean to exerciseit . " " You 've arranged for an adequate guard , I trust ? " " A hundred and fifty of us will move out together . It will be a long journey . At least we 'll protect one another . " . The simplicity of the declaration gave it added impact . Though he had realized the extent of the revolt , John had not visioned so large a migration . It was an impressive tribute to the Wrights . " You 've chosen your route ? " " Indeed yes . We 've done some rapid planning since you went upriver . Our first thought was to cut across country and take the Creeks ' Lower Path --  " " The Lower Path would be the shortest march , " John agreed warily . Eager to know if Chris Martin had endorsed the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was with the maps that linked these backlands with the Mississippi , he knew the dangers of this particular trail . " Even the Lower Path seemed long enough , " said Evan Wright . " At the best , we 're facing a hard test . Most of us will be traveling by families  --  groups that came here at my urging . I tell myself I 'm thinking of them  --  not of my own fate . " John nodded soberly . Like a patriarch of old , Dr. Wright had led his people into the wilderness ; he had seen it blossom under their hands . It was a cruel stroke of fate that he must now lead them out again , before the first real fruits could be harvested . " I gather you hope to survive this journey , sir ? " " I think it 's reasonable to expect as much . There are few venturesI would n't face with Stella beside me . Of course I 'd never last without her . " " Where do you plan to settle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually , I suppose , we 'll go on to East Florida . I 've extensive holdings there , in Stella'sp156name . " The elder doctor closed the last of his ledgers . " Waste no tears upon us , John . We plan to reach our goal . " " By the Lower Path ? " " That was my original plan  --  but Colonel Martin vetoed it . The route strikes east and south , across the headwaters of the Pearl River . The land is swampy , and apt to be treacherous in this sea-son . " For once , thought John , Chris Martin had been honest . As chief architect of the Natchez war , it was imperative that he make good his escape . Evidently he had decided that his salvation lay with the migrants . If this assumption was correct , Chris could be invaluableto the Wright party , since he knew the country thoroughly , and had a large acquaintance among the Creeks and the lower Choctaw tribes . " Did Chris suggest another route ? " " He felt we should move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then take the Middle Path . It 's farther , of course . But we 'd end among what the Creeks call their Upper Towns . And the going will be easier . " It was an excellent suggestion . So excellent , in fact , that John found himself examining it warily . " Yulee will be a great help in the back country , " he said . " So will Obadiah Hurt . They 've both volunteered as outriders . " " Why should they concern themselves with our problems , John ? " " Call us a team , if you like . Where one goes , the others follow . " " Does that mean you 're joining us ? " " We 're a team , Doctor , " said John steadily . " Unless you feel you wo n't need me . " " Your presence would be invaluable , of course ; but I 've no right to ask such a sacrifice . You came here to establish a practice  --  and you 've a wife to support . " The old doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely you 've nothing to fear from de Calvez ? " " In New Orleans , he offered me Spanish citizenship and a land grant  --  if I persuaded you to spare the fort . " John found he could smile , not too ruefully , at this glittering might-have-been . " Prob/ably I can still count on his patronage . I 'm afraid I would never accept it on his terms . " " Stay on  --  make sure . " " I 'm sure of that much now . " " Do n't pretend you 're ready to call yourself a Tory . " " Perhaps I ca n't go that far . I 'm still an ally of the Wrights . " The old doctor stacked his ledgers precisely , and began to stow them in a pair of saddlebags . He seemed hard put to control himself when he spoke again . " I must admit this makes me easier in my mind , " he said . " Both for myself and for Stella . Naturally , I hoped you 'd east your lot with us -- even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , did Faith . " " Would you repeat that , sir ? " This time , Evan Wright 's smile had all its old warmth . " She 's upstairs now , fitting Stella to a suit of buckskins  --  and designing one of her own . " " Perhaps I should thank her  --  for knowing me so well . " " Clambering over the boxes that encumbered the stair well , John was glad of this excuse to cut short the old doctor 's thanks . In the upper hall , he paused for breath before the door of his bedroom and listened to Stella and Faith chattering inside . Try as he might , he could catch no note of false courage in the women 's laughter . Lifting his hand to knock , he let it drop to his side : this was no time for a formal expression of gratitude . He had always realized that Faith would stand by the Wrights . His own decision to join them had been just as inevitable . We 'll each have our task on this migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve her husband 's life during the rigors of the journey . As for Faith , she would remain at his side , whatever the perils , until he made his final choice ... . Your own task , he added grimly , is the simplest of all  --  to watch Chris Martin like a patient hawk , until Chris has proved himself by deed as well as word.  |p158Later  , when he looked back on the beginning of that exodus , it was the silence he remembered most vividly . He had scarcely expected Godspeed from those who remained ; he had realized that the fugitives themselves would be muted to the point of tears . But he had been unprepared for the stony emptinessof Natchez itself , when the straggling cavalcade wound down from the bluff in the dawn , on its way to the Trace . That morning , the settlement might have been a deserted village . No children played under the fresh-leaved umbrella trees in the yards . There was no bustle of slaves in the breezeways , no chatter at the kitchen doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though it clung stubbornly to its rejection of these infidels , Natchez was ashamed to show its face today ; it would wait for the dust of their passing to settle before it came alive . " The way of the exile is hard , " said Evan Wright . " Perhaps this is the proper time to remind ourselves that trouble brings wisdom . It 's a poor consolation now . It may be worth remembering later . " He drew off beside the trail , where John and Chris Martin had reined in , while the latter re-formed the long line of travelers . Watching him narrowly , John saw that no cavalryman could have sat more firmly in his saddle ; even in the full light of morning , the old doctor seemed sturdy as the horse he rode . He guessed that Evan Wright had drawn unexpected strength from the challengeconfronting him  --  to say nothing of the loyalty be read in the honest English faces that streamed past this vantage point , like a homespun army in review . It had been decided that Chris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day . Next came Colonel Kirby , also on horseback  --  the leader of the first group of migrants . Majorp159Beasley led the second group , at the same brisk pace . Page llammondand Ralph Otis rode as rear guard , to cover a string of pack horses . Yulee and Obadiah Hurt covered the expedition as outriders  --  exploringthe flanks of the Trace for possible enemies , or cantering ahead to report on the state of a road that was , in places , no more than a game trail . Stella and Faith , in new buckskin kirtles , marched with the family groups that made up the bulk of the procession . As John had noted instantly , most of the company were sturdy , back-countryfolk , long since inured to the hardships of the wilderness . From the oldest paterfamilias to the smallest toddler , Evan Wright 's cavalcade was seasoned for the task ahead . All in all , the old doctor had reason for his quiet pride , as the last marcher filed past the clearing . Chris Martin had planned his expedition well ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to give the ex-sutler his due . Marching in two compact groups , with outriders on each flankand a musket on each man 's shoulder , the migrants were well protected from assault , immune to the marauding bands that had alwaysroved the Trace . Thanks to that long string of horses , the women and children could ride in turn ; the youngest could be nested among the packs , or ride pickaback among the small groups of slaves who had joined in the exodus . Most of the travelers were leaving Natchez richer than they had entered it , thanks to the largess of the Wrights . Shrewd bargains had been driven by those who remained : slaves had gone for but a fraction of their value , and those who had disposed of homes and land had been forced to accept the buyer 's price . But the brief period of English triumph at Fort Panmure had paid handsomely : a fortune in pelts rode among the packs that followed the marchers . A second fortune jingled in Evan Wright 's saddle bags  --  the product of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divide among each family to reach Augusta , share and share alike . John bad expected Chris Martin to cry out against this arrange/ment . To his surprise , the sutler had applauded Dr. Wright 's decision to share both the booty and the cash . A common misfortune , said Chris glibly , had drawn this group together : there was nothing like a common reward to insure its success . For his part , Chris wanted no more than the others . He had gambled and lost at Fort Panmure : he was eager to use his woodsman 's skill to lead them all to Augusta . .. . Today , riding side by side with John , easing his mount a little to give Dr. Wright the honor of setting the pace , Chris offered his familiar , crooked smile . They had crossed swords more than once while final plans were settled . John had probed their selfelectedleader as skillfully as he could  --  if only to assure himself that the real Chris Martin , and the wilderness guide who jogged beside him , were one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final prod . " We 'll have few chances to be alone , " he said . " Is n't it time you explained why you 're here ? " " Misery makes strange trail mates , Doc . " " Do you expect me to believe you 're guiding us to Augusta for unselfish motives ? " " ' Course I do n't . I 'll take my share when this picnic 's over . Right now , I 'm in good company , and safe from de Galvez " " This is n't going to be exactly a picnic , you know . " The sutler 's grin broadened . " Now you mention it , we may run into a mite of trouble . But we 're long on grub and gumption . Most of us are trail-wise . Just you believe in me , Doc , and follow my blaze marks . You may sweat blood before you 're through . You may be hungry enough to eat your moccasins . But I 'll take you to the Savannah River . " John could only mutter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow continued to hang over his mind , deepening with each word Chris uttered . " Why did you let me come along ? " he asked dourly . " Are n't you afraid I 'll spoil your game ? " " For the last time , there 's no game to spoil . Now you 've raised the subject though  --  just why did you join us ? "  | " Maybe to keep an eye on you . " For an instant a flash of anger wiped the grin from the sutler 's lips . " Seems like you and I 'll never cotton to each other  --  do n't it , now ? We can at least pretend to , so long as we 're on trail to-gether . " What Chris had just said was reasonable enough : there was no room for personal dislike at a campfire . And yet , as he admitted this obvious fact , John 's doubting persisted . " Frankly , I 'd have been happier if you 'd just cut and run , " he admitted . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may even shake hands with you , if we reach Augusta . But do n't expect it now . " He rode back down the Trace , telling himself that his words had been both churlish and unfair . It was a relief to put the sutler from his mind as Stella Wright came into view in the line of march . No man , unless made of stone , could have failed to enjoy the sight of her . With her head thrown back proudly and the green , filtered sunlight gleaming on her blond hair , she might have been a Viking from a simpler age , marching toward a battle still unjoined . Knowing she was aware of his eyes , John did not prolong his staring . Instead , he dropped to the ground just before she could draw abreast  --  and , seizing her elbows , lifted her to the saddle in his stead , " Your husband insists you join him for a while , " he said . " I 've never ridden astride , John . " " That 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal . " Stella looked down at him from her unaccustomed elevation . For that instant , at least , they were cut off from the dusty world about them  --  a dangerous isolation which John broke promptly by handing her the reins . " Anchor yourself to those stirrups , and guide him with your knees , " he advised . " You 'll find it 's far easier than sidesaddle . " " I can see that now . But I do n't deserve to ride so soon . " " Others will take their turn later . The Wrights should lead us to our first camp . " Stella did not look back : he guessed that perhaps she , too , hadp162felt the danger when their hands had touched . Now that her back was turned , he dared to admire her without fear of detection  --  noting the patrician way she handled the ancient plow horse , her serene unawareness of the glances she drew from other women in the cavalcade . " Walk with us awhile , John ? " He turned to find himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long-legged grace , and matching the two lanky Hammond girls stride for stride . " Tess asked if we 'd stop for a nooning , " she told him . " I said we ca n't lose a moment of daylight . Not while we 're on the Trace . " He fell into step beside them , and smiled at Tess Hammond  --  wishing that he could enjoy this adventure with her lighthearted acceptance . " Anyone who gets hungry can ask for molasses and corn pone , " he said . " But you must walk while you eat . Colonel Martin wo n't have stragglers . " " I can wait until camp , Dr. Powers , " said the girl . " That 's my sister 's stomach you hear growling , not mine . " Sarah Hammond replied with an insult that was just as spirited . Hearing his own laughter mingle with Faith 's , John could not help wondering if jokes would come as easily after a month on trail . He put the worry aside instantly : Tess and Sarah Hammond were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be trusted to keep their nerve . He was glad when the girls scampered on to join a game of touch-tag . There were questions to put to Faith : it hardly matteredif they were the same queries that had plagued him since that strange , almost clairvoyant midnight at Trail 's End . Somehow , Faith seemed far closer , now that they were really marching out the first lap of this grueling journey . He made a cautious start , if only to test the depth of that new understanding . " Have we been walking together three minutes or forever ? " She flashed him a loyal smile . " You were giving Stella her lessonjust now . Shall I give you one in turn ? "  | " You 'll find me a willing pupil , " he told her . " Forget about time , John : time is a dream on the Trace . Today is all that matters . Tomorrow , you 'll think you 've been born here . " " Now that we 've settled with the calendar , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ? " " You answered that in Natchez . " " Speak for yourself , then . At least you 're a free agent . " " These people call me Mrs. John Powers , " she said proudly . " You may not realize it , but that 's a rather important title . Would they trust you , if I 'd turned coward and stayed behind ? " " Is that your only reason ? " " Of course it is n't . I 'd have joined this march without you  --  and you know it . The Wrights can use all sorts of help . " " Let 's forget the Wrights a moment  --  and talk about us . " " We ca n't , John . Us means everyone now , not you and I " Shewas still smiling , but he saw that her eyes were grave enough . " Ofcourse that 's lesson number two . You 'll find it a bit harder . " " Are n't you putting things rather bleakly ? " " Perhaps it 's the very lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living from day to day , with no John Powers to trouble you . Settlingeach crisis as it comes  --  and never mind tomorrow . " He glanced down the long , dust-caked column , and began to see her meaning dimly . Would it really be possible to draw this wildernessabout him like a cloak , shutting out a future that seemed insoluble ? When the one real problem was survival , would those other dilemmas drop into perspective at last ? " Thanks for the lesson , " he said . " I 'll begin studying it at once . " " See that you do , " she said , with those same grave eyes . " There 'll be others as we go along . " " May I say I 'm fortunate in my teacher ? " " I 'll accept the compliment , " said Faith Gordon . " After all , you 've just walked into my world . I know the landmarks . " Her hand closed on his , as a song moved down the marching column . With no sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others.  |p164One  morning , one morning The weather being f airA mother and a daughter Went out to take the airAnd as they went a-walking I heard the daughter vowI must and will get married I 'm in the notion now . It was a melody from English hedgerows , rich with Anglo-Saxon melancholy . But these migrants did not sing it sadly as they swung along the Trace . Feeling his own heart lift , John saw that shared courage could be a real and vital thing  --  that these sturdy marchers , who had already tamed the Mississippi wilderness , could face a second wilderness unafraid . Swinging into the next chorus , he knew that he had begun to learn Faith 's second lesson . Suppose you were to try it And could not find a man ? Oh , never mind , dear mother , For there is miller Sam And there is Jack the farmer A-whistling at his plow I must and will get married I 'm in the notion now . They camped that first night in a pine grove , a spot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of aromatic needles made a natural mattress for weary bodies . They had come less than twenty miles from Natchez , but it seemed well to test their muscle by degrees , until they grew hardened to the march.  |p165The  outriders had each brought in a deer , which they had butcheredbefore the arrival of the main party . A feast of venison , augmentedwith stores from the packs , gave those first campfires a gala air  --  as though this were a bizarre outing , with home and hearth over the next bend in the trail . Listening to the twang of a guitar on the grassy plot before the cook fires , and the shouts of laughter and song that passed from tent to tent , John told himself that the migration was off to a good start . True , they had done no more than break into the routine of the trail , but the cavalcade was now fairly launched . Chris had announced a thirty-mile goal for tomorrow , and these hardy folk had taken the order without a murmur of protest . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg of their march . As the crow flew , Augusta was perhaps five hundred miles distantfrom tonight 's encampment . But these trampers knew ( almost to the last child ) that the actual journey would be far longer . Worn down by generations of boatmen , this portion of the Trace was simple enough to follow . Once they struck east , into the virginforest of the Middle Path ( which was no path at all , but a dimly blazed Indian trail ) , they would often count themselves lucky if they averaged ten miles each day . As the camp settled slowly for the night , John moved from fire to fire , spreading what cheer he could while he checked on the health of his charges . Save for a case of ague in the Otis brood , a sprain or two among overeager young marchers , and a few blisters , there was no work for a doctor tonight . Yet he could feel that his presence spread assurance among the tents that had mushroomed here beneath the pines . For all the surface bravado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds had begun to turn back to a past forsakenforever , or fumbled , just as vainly , at a future shrouded by doubt . It was good to have a man of medicine here tonight . Though John realized that his potions would never be as popular as those of Chris Martin ( circulating with a jug in each fist and ap166laughing word for everyone ) , he was sure they were valued none the less . There was time for a visit with Evan Wright , though he was careful not to prolong it . So far as he could judge , the old doctor had come through the day in excellent spirits . Preparing to sample the comfort of a folding camp cot , he protested but mildly when Stella insisted on making her own bed in a nest of blankets at his feet . " When I brought my wife to Natchez , " he told John , " Trail 's End was ready to receive her , down to the last teacup . Tonight , she chooses a couch of pine needles . How can she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I 'm just as contented , " said Stella . She was spreading a quilt across her husband 's cot : as always , she managed to efface herself deftly while he was speaking . " She even has a reason for her contentment , " said the elder doctor . " The fact that I 'm doing what I think is right --  " " Perhaps you 've a wife in a million , " said John . " It 's a fact that few husbands recognize . " " This husband is keenly aware of his blessings , " said Evan Wright . " I hope you will say as much for your own campfire , John . While you were playing the healing shepherd among my flock , your wife was pitching your tent without help . " " We offered to send London , " said Stella . " But Faith wanted to prove she could do everything herself . " Understanding that impulse perfectly , John moved across the camp to find that Faith had raised their canvas abode beneath a cedar tree , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal bivouac  --  with a double shelter from the drenching dews that would fall before morning , a fire banked expertly to burn through the hours of darkness . The canvas overhead was familiar : he recognized the extra sail from Yulee 's sloop , which had served Faith as a tent on their voyage upriver . Tonight , the bivouac was constructed for two . Faith herself , bundledto the eyes in a Spanish serape , was already asleep ; a similar bedroll at her side awaited his occupancy , With eyes still uponp167him , he had no choice but to roll into his own poncho . Faith , it seemed , had taken her declaration of the afternoon quite literally . Already , she was an integral part of the camp , submerging her own problems in the greater needs of the many ; secure in her knowledge that she had proved herself as adept as any woodsman , she could sleep the sleep of the just . Reminding himself to complimenther in the morning , he found he could drop into a repose as dreamless as her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle tug at his ankle was repeated : he recognized the silhouette of Yulee , crouched between the shelter and the glow of the fire . Moving cautiously so as not to waken Faith , he joined the half-breed in the outer circle of tents . With Yulee 's hand at his elbow , he moved beyond the camp , still deep in sleep , and wrapped in a silence broken only by the pawing of the tethered pack horses , an occasionalbasso-profundo snore . " Senor Hurt is on sentry duty , " said the half-breed . " He felt I should waken you . " " Is something wrong ? " " We are not quite sure , jef e . " Yulee was speaking a quick , pidgin Spanish now . " Colonel Martin has been gone since midnight . He slipped past his own pickets like a snake . " " You followed him ? " " Naturalmente , Senor Medico  --  as you ordered . " Yulee 's voice dropped to a whisper . " He has only now returned to his shelter . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yulee . " " Colonel Martin was searching for something he did not find . Mostly , he moved up the Trace itself . Twice , he scouted the brush to the east , He discovered nothing . " " You 're sure of that ? " Yulee 's teeth flashed in a smile . " Colonel Martin can see in the dark , fete : but I have trailed his kind before . I think he searched for Indian sign . " John nodded soberly as he led the way toward the central camp/fire : the sentries that Chris Martin had posted so importantly last night had begun to return to the camp , shaking the dew from their ponchos . Already , figures were moving quietly among the tents , to begin preparation for the communal breakfast : the snore that issuedfrom the ex-sutler 's shelter was most convincing  --  and John avoided it by instinct to seek out Obadiah . He found the Kentuckian seated on a pile of saddlecloths beside his own fire , gnawing a cold venison steak . His calm reception of the half-breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that Obadiah could face most brands of skulduggery with detachment . " Answer me this , Doc . Did you ever meet a sutler you could trust ? " " What 's he after ? " " We 'll know soon enough , I reckon . If I was you , I 'd try to find out even sooner . " " Chris plans to meet Red Shoes later , to arrange for guides across the Middle Path : he announced that much in open meeting . " So he did , now you mention it . They do n't come slicker than Chris Martin . " " Do you think it was a blind ? " " Call it dust in our eyes , " said Obadiah . " He knows that Yulee and I will pick up Indian sign any day now ; if we do , he wants us to think it 's honest Indian . " " The Choctaws helped capture Fort Panmure ; they 're supposed to be allies of England . " " Not Red Shoes , Doc . I 've brushed with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glove with the traders , but he 's more wildcat than sachem . I doubt if he 's sat at a council fire for years . " " Surely he wo n't risk attacking us . " " I would n't put it past him  --  if Chris do n't give hire his reward for that hoax at the fort . " Obadiah considered his next words carefully . " ' Course , I could be dead wrong ; it takes all kinds of In/dians to make a wilderness . But if I was you , I 'd keep Yulee on that sutler 's tail . " " Perhaps we should consult Dr. Wright on this . He 's the leader of this group . " " The old dot 's a fine man , " said the Kentuckian . " But it happenshe lives inside his head . Turn him loose in these woods  --  he 'd walk in circles till he died . " " I 'd call him a fair judge of men . " " And so he is  --  to a point . He let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's a just man , too . That 's why he paid Yulee full value for his sloop , and gave us a bonus for working as his outriders . Trouble is , he 's apt to fall over backward being fair to everyone . Chris Martin plain do n't rate the job of captain . By rights , you should be giving the orders . " " He 's still a hero to these people . " " So he is  --  for now . Ai n't that why we 're here ? To prove he 's a stinkard too ? " There was no time for more , since the camp was now astir : Chris Martin himself had come yawning from his tent to give his first commands of the day . Despite his conviction that the man was a potential traitor in their midst , John could not help admiring his assurance as he whipped the cavalcade through breakfast . The pines of their campsite were still misted with dawn when they entered the Trace again , determined to break their first day 's record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plodded northeast along a deep-notched trail , with no pause for the traditional nooning . Old and young alike were given rides on a turnabout basis ; Hammond and Otis , riding a patient rear guard , had no need to report stragglers today . When the sun had moved to the west , the road turned sharply at last , carrying the cavalcade into a region of dense canebrakes , broken by rust-colored sloughs and alive with the mournful arguments of bird life . More than once , it was necessary to drive snakes from the path  --  cottonmouths for the most part ,  |p170with  an occasional diamondback that continued to rattle defiance from the shrub . Just before the trail lifted to high ground again , Obadiah planted a musket ball between the eyes of a young alligator , as the saurian rose from its nap on a mudflat . The creature 's powerful tail , cut from a still-twitching carcass , was added to the larder as a piece de resistance for tonight 's menu . ' Gator tail ( as Obadiah explained to the skeptical John ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bed of lightwood coals . Shortly after midday , Chris had ridden ahead quite openly . On the surface , there had been nothing unusual about that departure . Obadiah , who knew the Trace blindfolded , had been assigned to lead the marchers in the other 's absence ; Evan Wright , still riding proudly at the head of his band of pilgrims , continued to set the pace . " Chris is getting bolder , " said the Kentuckian , in an aside to John , after Yulee had quietly picked up the ex-sutler 's trail . " Mind you , I 'm not ready to accuse him of planning an ambush . But it does hurt my feelings a mite that he should think we 're so blind . " John glanced down the trail . Faith , taking her turn on horsebacktoday , was carrying the Beasley baby in her arms . Far back in the steadily moving file , Stella was leading the others in a revivalhymn , a sovereign spirit-lifter in the hot , midafternoon drowse . Viewed from this angle , the emigres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure far removed from the evil designs of man . It was hard to believe that death might be lurking behind a crossbow in the next thicket , or waiting to pounce from those mossed limbs that hung above the trail . " Should I speak to Dr. Wright now ? " " Leave Chris to Yulee , Doc , just like I said . If he 's that careless , it means he 'll trip himself in time . "  |p171In  the midmorning of the third day , the wisdom of Obadiah'sadvice was brought home to John with stunning force  --  and , like so many crises , almost without warning . Chris Martin had gone cantering ahead once again , with the excuse that he must test the trail  --  and Yulee had ghosted into the brush , at a nod from Obadiah , to keep him in view . John himself had served as outrider that day , in the hope of flushing another deer for the larder  --  and had just reined in his horse at the top of a long , steep rise . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a warning that they must soon leave the comparativeease of the Trace for the rigors of the Middle Path . Drowsing a little in his saddle , aware of no real sensation beyond the beat of sunlight on his bared head , John was only mildly surprised to mark a spurt of dust ahead . Even before the rider himself came into view , he guessed that it was Yulee , returning with another report . Steeped as he was in the gentle melancholy of solitude , he merely raised one hand in greeting as the half-breed pulled his mount into an awkward , four-footed stop . His mind reacted but tardily to his scout 's first breathless words  --  that Chris had found Red Shoes at last . " Did n't Colonel Martin say they 'd meet ? " " You must come quickly  --  and see for yourself . Dr. Wright might not believe , if I am the only witness . " John was alert now . Yulee would know at once the difference between a casual contact with the Choctaw leader  --  and something far more sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Yulee wheeled back into the Trace . " You saw the meeting yourself ? " " It is a powwow , Doctor  --  with a war party "  |p172So  their long-nagging suspicions had borne fruit at last . " Should n't we warn the others ? " " There is no time . You must see and decide . " Yulee did not speak again : there was no further need for words as they drove down the trail . Riding Indian-fashion , with both fists in his horse 's mane , the half-breed continued to outdistance John , who was forced to dodge more than one branch in his effort to keep his companion in view . When they had covered some four miles , Yulee swung to the right , and vaulted to the ground , in the shelter of a palmetto thicket . Beyond , in a clearing , a tethered horse cropped at the sun-bitten grass . The musket thrust muzzle down in the saddle boot was evidence enough that Chris considered himself secure while be made rendezvous with the Choctaws . " Where 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f e . " In his excitement , Yulee had slipped back to Spanish . " Hate prisa , I beg of you . Already , we may be too late . " " Is it safe to come this close ? " " Follow me , Senor Medico . I will show you how . " John turned sharply , to find that Yulee had vanished . The halfbreed'svoice , ghosting from a dense mass of dog fennel , pulled him into the green ambush beside him . Dodging from tree to tree , nursing every scrap of cover , Yulee led the way to a steep downslope , masked in a tangle of palmetto scrub . When they had covered some two hundred yards of this difficult approach , the half-breed pulled back abruptly , on the lip of the ravine itself . Here , he parted the screen of leaves , with the gesture of a mathematician completing a demonstfation in geometry . " See for yourself , Doctor , " he whispered . " There is no danger  --  these dogs feel they are safe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . Perhaps a half-hundred braves were gathered here , in the ritualistic pattern of the war camp . In the precise center of the grassy plot , ap173fire burned . The warriors sat in two tight circles , feet pointed toward the flames , their guns and powder gourds suspended on forked sticks behind them . Each man was naked save for an apron of otter skin , decorated profusely with bird feathers . There were crane feathers in their scalp locks , and their glistening , copper-red bodies were daubed with white hieroglyphs . Around each mouth was the characteristicblue tattoo of the Choctaw  --  or , rather , that part of the nation whose hunting ground embraced the delta formed by the Yazoo and the Mississippi . The fact that this party had strayed from its traditional preserve told its own story instantly . Red Shoes and his braves , having played their part as English allies at Fort Panmure , had returned as simple marauders . The chief himself sat before the fire , his shaven skull decorated with a barbaric headdress of egret feathers . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silver on his chest . John would have recognized him even without the bright vermilion moccasins . Red Shoes was a head taller than his tallestwarrior . The deference of his four captains ( whose ornaments were only a shade less magnificent than their leader 's ) set him apart instantly . At the moment , he was in the act of passing a calabash pipe to Chris Martin . The sutler , who sat cross-legged before the fire , seemed entirely at home : his arrogance was a match for Red Shoes ' cold-lidded stare . Only the quick dart of his eyes betrayed an inner agitation . John could understand that fear when Red Shoes took up a tomahawk and whirled it about Chris Martin 's head . The circle burst into a roar of primitive laughter . " What are they saying , Yulee ? " John asked in a whisper . " Red Shoes is telling Colonel Martin how they treat enemies . " " Can you hear more ? " " Not at this distance . I will go closer . You must return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let you take that risk . "  | " There will be little risk . Colonel Martin brought two jugs to the council . Most of them are drunk as goats . " Once again , only the whisper marked the spot where the halfbreedhad rested ; the faintest of ripples in the dog fennel told John that Yulee had begun to move toward the outer circumferenceof the powwow . Since he had no other choice , he dropped to hands and knees , and began to retrace his own route to the clearing where Chris Martin 's horse was tethered . His mind still whirling , he could welcome the absolute concentrationneeded to cover his progress . Though he could never equal Yulee , his return journey was a respectable achievement . Moving in a wide circle to take full advantage of the patches of dog fennel , he needed a good twenty minutes to reach the clearing . When he tumbled into it at last , be was still breathless , and his mind continued to recoil from conscious planning . Yulee had not yet returned . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both their horses deeper into the scrub and tethered them on short ropes , where the sounds of their grazing would not betray their presence . Back at the clearing , he checked the sutler 's saddlebags for possible clues to his intentions . The search uncoverednothing but a pint of whiskey , and a few rounds of ammunitionfor the musket , still upended insolently in the saddle boot . John 's hand had just closed on the stock when a familiar voice addressedhim from the palmettos . " That gun 's hair-triggered , Doc . Would n't play with it , if I were you , , , Chris Martin lurched rather than walked into the clearing . Preoccupiedas he was , John had not heard his approach through the yielding curtain of dog fennel . He stared at him now , across the horse 's flank , and cursed himself for his neglect . As a cadet of the Pennsylvania Rangers , he had learned long since that a man 's life could hang on small things -- the snap of a twig , the sixth sense that anticipates destruction before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had tossed his own life away in a matter of seconds , as casually as though the knife ( now balanced on the sutler 's palm ) was already quivering in his throat . " Lift up your hands , Doc , " said Chris . " And keep facing me . Wo n't help to back up , ' cause you 're in my sights right now . " The boast , John saw , was justified . Drunk though he was , Chris was quite steady . The hand that held the dagger seemed carved in stone as it half lifted above his head , then hung there motionless . All too vividly , John remembered how the sutler had split playing cards at ten paces in the taproom of the Royal George , after hours of wassail . " Why should you want to kill me ? " he asked  --  and knew , even before the words were out , how grotesque the question was . Chris Martin had meant to destroy him for a long time . He had only awaited the proper moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sutler . " You know all about me now , and why I came this far . That 's more'n I could allow even my best friend . " " Are n't you going to ask how I got here ? " " Does n't matter now , " said Chris . " You came to spy , and I 've caught you . That 's what counts --  " So Yulee had been trapped on the lip of the ravine  --  and Chris had come here for his revenge . Perhaps his red allies were closing in now . The threat of the knife might be only a blind  --  an anticipationof more ingenious torture . John heard his voice force the issue . The hoarse croaking seemed to come from a great distance . " Ca n't you get it over with ? " " Sure , Doe . Whenever I like . " The sutler 's feet were uncertain in the sandy clearing , but his knife hand was still motionless overhead . " Just thought you 'd like the whole story first  --  so you 'd have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take many forms . Listening to the sutler 's plans , as Chris outlined them step by step , he could grasp the man 's almost fiendish thoroughness . Save for Yulee 's skill as a trailer , the trap might well have been sprung on the Natchez migrants without a hitch . . . . Then he remembered that Yulee'sp176discovery ( like his own intervention ) had come too late . It would be easy for Chris to return to camp that evening and put his ruse in motion . Easier still to shrug off the disappearance of a pair of scouts who had ridden too far , too fast . " Never mind the rest , Chris ! " he half shouted . " You knew I 'd expose you , if I could . Why let me live this long ? " " Maybe I did miss a trick there . But I figured you were too lovesick to pay me much mind . " Even with the shadow of eternity upon him , John felt his throat swell with rage . " You do n't overlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still alive . Tell me this , Doc . Which one of the girls will miss you more ? " John flung himself at his tormentor  --  though a good three yards of sand still parted them . Strangely enough , Chris Martin made no move to hurl the knife . The smile on those full lips seemed frozen ; the hand bent backward above his head ( with death 's messenger balanced on the palm ) remained as strangely immobile . It was only when he heard the bowstring 's twang ( a splitsecondafter the thudding impact of the arrow ) that John saw why . For that small segment of time , Chris himself seemed frozen in mid-air . The snout of the arrow , winking blood-red in the sun , had smashed through his chest wall from behind , driven at pointblankrange from the dog fennel . Then the knife hand crumpled ; the blade slid smoothly from the inert palm , to sink haft-deep in the sandy loam . Chris coughed just once as he pitched face forward . Save for the deep , soft-plucked note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clearing . Yulee emerged from the thicket on silent feet , unlimbering the six-foot longbow as he advanced to gentle the sutler 's mount , which showed unmistakable signs of bolting from the presence of death . He knelt briefly to snap the feathered shaft of the arrow before he tossed the body over one shoulder , carried it to the horse , and tumbled it across the saddle . " They were really drunk as goats , " he said . " It was an easy matter to steal a bow . "  | " Did you  --  follow him here ? " Too amazed , for the time being , at finding himself alive , John could hardly stammer out the question . He was still on hands and knees , where he had flung himself by instinct to avoid Chris Martin 's knife . " Of course , Doctor . What else ? It was time for this man to die . A time when an arrow was better than lead . " The half-breed 's voice was dead calm , but his eyes were bitter with controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struck . It seemed best to let him speak  --  to reveal his own plan . " John laughed softly , but his laughter still held a note of hysteria . " You mean you  --  stalked him ? As you 'd  --  stalk a deer ? " The words came in short , breathless bursts . The voice was not yet his own . " When a man digs his own grave , it is best that he dig deep . " Yulee glanced contemptuously at the body that lay across the saddle . " Not that this carrion is worth burial . We can dispose of it along the Trace . " John staggered to his feet at last . It was good to be alive  --  and he would savor his reprieve in a moment . For the present , it was simpler to stumble in Yulee 's tracks  --  and to accept the halfbreed'shand at his elbow , while he lifted himself to the saddle of his own mount . " Did I  --  remember to thank you , Yulee ? " " There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is much to do . " Neither of them spoke again as they cantered into the Trace , with Yulee in the lead . Little by little , John could feel his mind edge back toward reality . He had joined the cavalcade with just one purpose  --  to challenge the sutler 's shoddy claim to leadership . Today ( to put things bluntly ) he had come forward to prove himself the better man . . .. True , he had just escaped a fatal blunder  --  but the chance to prove himself was still there . His vision had cleared completely now : he could ride as bravely as Yulee in their headlong dash to rejoin the marching column . It was only when they had driven a good two miles down the Tracep178that the memory of Chris Martin 's last taunt exploded like a delayedrocket in his brain . Somehow , the sutler had plumbed his deepest secret  --  the desiresJohn had not admitted fully , even to himself . It was the crowning irony that Chris , of all people , should force him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dashing hell-for-leather to save the lives of the Natchez migrants . Just in time , he remembered Faith and her hard-won wisdom . In the wilderness , he reflected , a man solved each problem as it arose . At the moment , simple survival was all that mattered . Tomorrow , or the day after , he would attack this other problem and surmount it . He was not the first male in history who had been tempted by two women , and could settle on neither . Evan Wright heard them out in silence . Obadiah Hurt , holding his mount on a tight rein , emitted a few back-country oaths as John and Yulee finished their macabre recital . The empty saddle on Chris Martin 's horse was a potent reminder of the tragedy that had just missed striking a death blow at the cavalcade . It might still strike , if the leaders of today 's march could not devise a plan to meet it . The Kentuckian spat a final curse . " Where 's the carcass ? " " In a slough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wo n't the Indians spook , when they find he 's gone ? " " The powwow was over when Colonel Martin left , " said Yulee . " Red Shoes did not expect him to return . " " How do we account for his absence here ? " " Chris spent most of his time scouting , " said John . " No one will be troubled , if he does n't appear tonight . " " You intend to march straight on ? " " It 's a chance we 'll have to take . "  | " I still think it 's suicide to pass the war camp , " said Obadiah . " How can we be sure they have n't set an ambush ? " " It 's high noon , " said John , glancing up at the sun . " Every man in our column is armed . Not that we 'll be trading shots on the Trace . Yulee says that Red Shoes and his braves are too drunk to leave camp before dark . Besides , it 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright spoke in a voice that seemed oddly remote from the business at hand . " I still ca n't believe it --  " " Yulee heard the whole plan , sir . " " Tell it to me again , John . Not that I care for details  --  but I must get it in my mind . " John glanced at Obadiah , who gave a wordless shrug . Both of them understood the older doctor 's hesitation . To the idealists of this world , it is a bitter shock to discover that some men are purely evil . So far , Evan Wright 's mind refused to grasp the fact that Chris Martin had plotted the death of one hundred and fifty persons , solely for his personal gain . " Chris was to direct us to a campsite where the Trace joins the Middle Path , " John said . " At dawn , he would have called in the pickets : that was to be Red Shoes ' signal to attack . Naturally , they 'd have to butcher the lot of us : Chris could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choctaws would claim the pelts , and such gear as they fancied . Chris would have taken the cash in your saddlebags  --  and a free path to the Savannah . " Obadiah cut in , with just a hint of impatience , " Then so far as Red Shoes knows , Chris is still alive ? And the trap 's to be sprung on schedule ? " " That 's our trump card , " said John . " I 'm afraid we must play it . " " Why not take fifty men , and bottle ' em in that ravine ? If they 're as drunk as Yulee says , we could bag the lot . " " Not in cold blood , " said Evan Wright quickly . " I could never sanction that . " " They 'd do it to us soon enough . "  | " I agree with Dr. Wright , " said John . " We must let Red Shoes make the first hostile move . " " Have it your way , gentlemen , " said the Kentuckian . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just like Chris planned . We 'll never get the chance again . " " Obadiah 's right , sir , " said John , as Dr. Wright covered his eyes with his hand . " You know what chance we 'd have in a running battle with fifty Indians . " " Very well , John . Let 's say we make camp  --  and lie in wait . How can you be sure we 'd survive ? " " We outgun ' ern , almost two to one , " said Obadiah . " Give us a few hours to dig in , and place our rifles . They 'll never know what slapped ' em down . " " What of the women and children ? " " Sorry to put it that rough , but they 're part of the bait . Right again , Doc ? " " That 's only the beginning , " said John . " We must keep this to ourselves until the last moment . At the very least , until we 're in camp tonight . " Evan Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid I 'm not that finished a performer . " " Then you must stay at the head of the column and speak to no one . " John 's voice was intentionally blunt ; he could see that the older man 's eyes were still clouded with doubt . " It 's easy for you to be a realist , John . You almost lost your life . But I ca n't assent to wholesale killing so readily  --  even if it 's a mortal enemy . " Again , Obadiah and John exchanged glances . " Do n't make us put it to the vote , sir , " said the Kentuckian . " You know what the result would be . " " There 's no need for a vote , " said Dr. Wright . " You and John are the natural leaders now . The most I can call myself is a . spiritualmainspring . If we 're alive tomorrow , I 'd suggest that one of you be named our captain . "  | " Doc Powers is my boy , " said Obadiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll lay odds the camp picks him too . " Evan Wright smiled wanly  --  for the first time since his shoulders had sagged under the weight of John 's report . " May I make the vote unanimous ? " John spoke with his eyes on the trail ahead . " It 's a post I wo n't take willingly , " he said . " Consider yourself elected as of now . What 's your first order ? " " To keep marching as before , " John told him . " With a song or two , if possible . I 'll see to that now . " A dozen times in the long , hot day , he rode down the column to make sure that there was no slackening of the pace . The spot Chris had chosen for a camp was far along the Trace , and it was essential they arrive there in good time . It was quite as essential that the faces of the marchers reflect no change from their prevailingmood . Yulee had assured him that the war party would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Red Shoes had posted spies along the route  --  so they must act as if they suspectednothing . John needed all his discipline to play the part of a happy outrider , with time for a laugh and joke for everyone . He had no doubt that his performance was convincing  --  indeed , there was too much at stake for it to be otherwise . Stella and Faith , with whom he paused for extended chats , seemed taken in by his chaffing , and responded in kind . Without seeming obvious , he took care to ride close to both of them while the cavalcade wound past the little clearing where Yulee 's arrow had found its target . Already , it seemed incredible that he had escaped death there ; it was hard to picture a half-hundred Choctaws , bedded in a ravine a scant half mile to the south and dreaming of scalps and glory . " You are in good spirits , John , " said Stella , when Faith had dropped back to help amuse the children . " Why did you laugh just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must we always have a reason for happiness ? "  | " No , my friend , " she said , with lowered eyes . " But it helps  --  does n't it ? " " I 'll tell you mine , since you insist , " he said . " I 'm learning to live on trail . Or should I say , to live in the present  --  and to rejoice in it ? Right now , I 've just one responsibility  --  to make camp safely tonight . Beyond that , I refuse to look ; only this afternoon is real . " " Would you object if I let my imagination stray a bit farther ? " " Do n't , Stella , I beg of you . Think only of the corn pone and venison awaiting you at sundown . We 'll be in Augusta soon enough . " " Are n't you looking forward to Augusta , John ? " " No . Are you ? " " Why not , if we can take up our lives there ? " " Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this . Do n't forget we 'll be saying our goodbyes in Augusta . " " Must it be goodbye , John ? " " You and your husband will be going on to St. Augustine --  " " So will you  --  I hope . " " I 'm told that East Florida is full of fundless Tories . There will hardly be room for me . " " Evan will need a long rest to regain his health --  " If he ever regains it , thought John . Their eyes had dueled briefly on that ; he knew that she had shared the unspoken thought . " He 'll rest easier if he knew you were helping me . " " And how could I help in Augustine ? " " We 've estates to stake out  --  a whole new life to build . Eventually , you could both go into practice again . " " I 'm not sure Faith would care to live there . " Stella offered him a slow , revealing smile : once more , her eyes said more than her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last time you were upriver . You 've been more than chivalrous , caring for her as you have . Surely it need n't go on forever . " So the offer is definite , he thought  --  and she 's making it from the kindness of her heart . A new life in British Florida , now that Natchez was behind them . A chance to prove himself , as her coun/selor and friend  --  and , eventually , the chance to take Evan Wright 's place entirely , when the disease that wracked his body had claimed him . No one , he felt sure , would be happier at such a consummation than the old doctor himself . Stella was beautiful , she was gracious , and she was rich . And , as Faith had said , he was at least half in love with her . " Let 's not confuse tomorrow with today , Stella , " he said quietly . " We 've enough dangers to face now . " He left her on that , with a quick , laughing salute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew , was worse than no answer at all  --  but he had none . Thanks to the driving pace he set , the long line of fugitives reached Chris Martin 's chosen campsite a good hour before sunset . There was no mistaking that depression on the hillside where the two trails met . It was only when the night had settled in the forest behind them that John cupped his hands to call for general attention . Obadiah and a picked squad of helpers had worked busily to raise a low breastworks at the circumference of the hollow , and to level the palmetto scrub that lay , like a dusty green wall , between the campfires and the Trace . Using the palmetto fronds to mask their rude defenses , the Kentuckian had further strengthenedhis position by sinking rifle pits on the flanks of the western redoubt , which would surely absorb the first shock of the Choctaw onslaught . It was not the first time the camp had dug in for the night  --  and John knew it would not be the last . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never forget that moment of revelation  --  the tightpackedcircle of faces , the gleam of firelight on a hundred staring eyes , the soft-voiced wailing that broke out among the women when the news sank home . For that instant , he feared that panic would sweep the camp . Then , as the low murmur died , he was shamed by his own doubting . There was no real fear in those staring eyes  --  only a stubborn will to live . Faith summed up for the others , when her voice rose in thep184hush . " Most of us have fought Indians , " she said . " We 'll handle them tomorrow . " " We 'll handle them , my dear , " said John . " You 'll be where you belong  --  with the other ladies , in the precise center of camp . " " I can load a rifle as well as any man . So can other women among us . " And fire one too , if need be , thought John . " If you really want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Dr. Wright 's nurse . He 'll be setting up his surgery between those two cabbage palms , in case one is needed . If we can believe Obadiah Hurt , no enemy will cross his breastworks  --  but there 's no stopping their bullets . They 're armed with muskets . " " English muskets , at that , " said Colonel Larkin . " The Choctaws are supposed to side with us , same as the Creeks . " " These stinkards are more renegade than Choctaw , " put in Obadiah . Framed in firelight as he leaned on his long-barreled fowling piece , he seemed a tower of strength in that muted babble . " I 'm mighty proud to see that no one 's afraid . There 's no reason to be . Not if we keep our heads , and hug the ground . " " Obadiah is in command , " said John . " Beginning now , no one stirs without his orders . Is that clear ? " Dr. Wright spoke for the first time . " How can we be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's one good thing about an Indian , " said Beasley . " He 'll trail and steal by night  --  but he wo n't kill or be killed before sunrise , if he can help it . Seems he 's afraid of losing his way to the Happy Hunting Grounds , if he takes off in the dark . " " Then I 'd suggest a good night 's rest , if such a thing is possible , " said the elder doctor . " Naturally , we 'll keep our sentries at full strength until morning . Red Shoes will be expecting that . " John was glad to observe that his colleague 's tone was now quite composed . " For all we know , he may be listening out there now , " he said . " A few songs might not be amiss  --  if someone will lead us . " Stella rose from her place at her husband 's side , and took thep185guitar that Page Hammond offered . Watching her narrowly , John was sure that she was facing the coming crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatic overtone , he could understand that too . Like the new soldier about to smell powder for the first time , she was determined to appear more casual than the most grizzled Indian fighter . As though by common consent , she was allowed to sing the first verse of her song alone . Her clear soprano , floating into the void of the wilderness , should have seemed lost and alone . Insteadher voice laughed back at the night  --  mocking its terrors , until they dissolved clean away , and only the warm , vibrating melody had meaning . O f are you well , my own true love O fare you well awhileI 'm going away , but I 'm coming back If I go ten thousand mile . Faith 's contralto came in on the second verse . One by one , the women at the campfires joined in  --  hesitant , at first , to pour out unspoken fears in song , yet oddly cheerful , once they had found the pitch . O do n't you see yon pretty girl A-spinning at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like she feels . The men were singing now , a deep , crashing chorus that built its own barrier against loneliness and despair . On the third verse , one hundred and fifty English voices cast their defiance against the treacheries of the night  --  with a childish treble tossed in here and there , as the children of the Natchez cavalcade rocked into slumber in their mothers ' arms . John , singing as lustily as the rest , could only pray that the song had reached the Choctaw camp.  |p186That  night , the women and children slept in the first circle of tents  --  deep in the hollow that Chris Martin had chosen as their final resting place . In the outer circle of canvas and tarpaulin , seventy-odd riflemen composed themselves to uneasy rest , while they awaited the spring dawn . Beyond the camp , the sentries made their rounds , eyes glued on the dark forest mass that hemmed them , ears tuned to catch the first bird song  --  or the first hoot of an all too human owl . Despite Obadiah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentry duty . " Sleep while you can , Doc . You 'll soon be busy enough . " " Could you sleep , if someone else was doing your job ? " " ' Tai n't the same . I can smell a Choctaw before I hear him . So can Yulee . Do n't you fret  --  we 'll wake you in time for the show . " " I 'll still feel happier on my feet . " Occupied as he was , Obadiah had offered no further protest . All through the night ( as he paced his rounds on the edge of that grassy hollow ) John knew that the Kentuckian was in ceaseless motion about the camp , counting noses by touch rather than sight . At three o'clock , when the forest was still cloaked in black , he began to place his riflemen , using infinite care to move each unit of his command in utter silence . John , returning from his tour of duty , stumbled on a palmetto root and found himself gripped instantly in Obadiah 's arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carotid artery in the second before he was recognized . " See what I mean ? " the Kentuckian whispered . " You'd. be safer behind a log . " " Did you think I was Red Shoes ? "  | " Why not ? They 're thick as lice in August , and they 're closing in . " How can you be sure ? " " Ask any trapper , and he 'll admit he does n't rightly know . But I can feel ' em , inside my nose . They 're holding back , so far . Nary a man amongst ' em will raise a war whoop , until he can see the next one 's topknot . When they come , they 'll come fast as thun-der . " " Did you warn the women ? " " Just passed the word . They 're to lie flat and bite grass . " Obadiah met John 's eyes as they crouched in the graying light . The dimensions of the camp were small ; it was easy to imagine the destruction a few tomahawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd be happier , if you 'd order Faith and Mrs. Wright to join the others . " " So would I , Doc . But there 's a pair of ladies who wo n't take orders . They aim to be useful in this hoe-down , or die frying . " John glanced toward the far side of the camp . The light was changing from gray to pearl . He could make out the contours of two stumpy palms , midway of the northern and eastern breastworks . It had seemed the best spot for a field surgery ; he hoped it would not be caught in a cross fire . He considered checking on that fear ; instead he took up a short-barreled shotgun , and found his place in a rifle pit . Stella and Faith would insist on taking their risks with the others . The other sentries had begun to return to camp , as the silhouettesof the lightwoods took shape against the dawn . John was glad to note that they moved casually , without so much as a final glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush would have guessed that this huddled group of tents was staring wide awake . Obadiah moved down the breastworks on hands and knees to whisper final instructions . " You may be Tories , " he said , " but this time I want you to fight like Whigs on Bunker Hill . Do n't shootp188until you see the white of a Choctaw eyeball  --  and I 'd squeeze my trigger even then . If you hold your fire , we 'll drop half of ' em on the first volley . The fellows with shotguns can take the rest . " There were a few murmurs of assent . Hefting his own shotgun , careful to keep his head below the shelter of the palmetto fans , John drew a bead on an imaginary enemy . The tops of the pines had caught the sunrise now  --  but the underbrush at their base still held the night in a firm embrace , and the mist that had begun to spiral up from the bottom lands obscured the vision still more . The open space between the camp and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack before it overflowed the last tent ? " They are moving , Doctor . " It was Yulee , speaking at his side : John had noticed long ago that the half-breed 's vision was far keener than his own . Obadiah had just whispered the same comment . Try as he might , John could discern no movement in the underbrush beyond camp . " Sure there were n't more'n fifty , Doc ? " " Yulee 's count tallied with mine . " " They 're fixing to jump us from the west , like we hoped . Check your priming , boys  --  and stop breathing , if you can . " John took a second sight along the barrel of his shotgun . Loaded with a double charge of powder , it would be a deadly weapon at this range . His finger had crept under the trigger guard before he remembered that he must hold his fire until the second volley . The ragged curtain of mist had lifted a little  --  light had begun to invade the forest floor . Now , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already noted  --  patches of darker shadow , hunching into human form , to scuttle from bush to bush , to vanish and reappear again in the shelter of tree trunks . A muted bird call , picked up instantly from a thicket a scant hundred yards from camp , seemed the signal for a general advance , though John had yet to glimpse the face of the enemy . Save for those matched bird notes , the woods were silent . Evenp189the forest denizens seemed to feel a battle in the making  --  and waited breathless for the outcome . For all his choked-down fear , John could admire the precision of Red Shoes ' maneuver . Though the advance was concerted , it was impossible to pick out individuals in that dark , slow-moving mass . It was as though the night itself had risen on two legs , to ghost from ambush for a life-and-death struggle with day . Would the Choctaws move into the open at last and overwhelm the camp ? Red Shoes could still scent the trap , and recoil  --  though there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masse , with a battery of rifles primed and ready . It was almost a relief to see the first paint-smeared face lift above the grass . A dozen others burst into view at once  --  until the whole space before the camp swarmed with copper-red bodies , inching forward at an unhurried pace and flairing the morning breeze like so many hounds . John saw at once that the Indians were totally unaware of the reception that awaited them . If they still moved warily , it was only the caution of the hunter , approaching his kill on silent feet . They were near enough to count now , as the last of the war party wriggled into view from the farthest thicket . John felt the pressure inside his skull relax a trifle when he saw that the renegades had committed their entire force to a single assault . Believing that Chris Martin was within the camp , that the migrants were sleepingsave for a few drowsy sentries , Red Shoes had counted on surprise to sweep the field . For the last time , John glanced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheek to stock , eyes riveted on their sights , each man in that company had picked his target . Immobile as wooden carvings , they awaited the crack of Obadiah 's rifle , which would signal their first volley . He saw Red Shoes at last , at one wing of his force , his shoulders humped as he waddled toward his objective . Ungainly though he seemed on hands and knees , the Choctaw 's threat was real enough . John found himself fingering his musket a second time : the corn/mand to fire seemed forever in coming . True , the enemy were still elusive targets , while they crept from hummock to hummock . Yet he could pin Red Shoes , cleanly in his sights : the savage seemed near enough to touch . A bird call sounded from the far wing of the Indian advance  --  so naturally that John would have sworn a lark had just risen to try its wings in the sunrise . He saw the chief 's lips shape an answer to the call , watched his arch enemy rise to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of the camp . All down the line , the Choctaws popped into view . Red Shoes lifted his rifle high . The bird call changed to a war whoop , a high-pitched scream that poured like ice water down John 's spine . Moving in a tight arc , their feathers brave against the sunlight , the Indians charged the camp , hatchets and rifles at the ready . Obadiah held his fire even now . When the tension seemed beyondenduring , his rifle barked its signal  --  a short , decisive bark , followed by the thud of lead against flesh . John saw a brave tumble headfirst with the bullet in his heart , as the slamming volley and the great whorl of smoke from seventy gun barrels blotted the enemy from his musket . The second volley , fired from another rifle pit the instant the smoke had cleared , seemed to blunt the echo of the first and choked the last war whoop into silence . Staring up at the faltering red tide , feeling a strange detachment from the others , John saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Choctaw had been a standing target , and virtually every bullet had scored . Pinned to the lip of the hollow where they had expected to reap scalps and plunder , the survivors ' , paused just long enough to collect their wits . Then , as rapidly as at had advanced , the attack broke and fled . Of the original advance , only Red Shoes and a subchief still hung above the breastworks  --  and , even as he watched , John saw the second warrior go down like a squirrel before another rifle crack . The crash of twenty shotguns , fired point-blank at the retreat , blazed a finale to the Choctaw debacle . In all , less than a dozenp191Indians escaped the field ; several of these were dragging wounded limbs as they scrambled for the thickets . Bemused as he was by the smashing triumph of the defense , John had made no attempt to join that final volley . He could hardly believe his eyes when he saw Red Shoes come raging through the smoke to leap the breastworks . Driven by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the attack preferred death to dishonor . The tomahawk flashed in the sunlight , with John 's head as the target . His vital forces rose to the emergency , shifting the musket to his shoulder . There was no sound beyond a faint click when the hammer fell . Rolling desperately with the threat of death upon him , he knew that the flint had missed fire . A great roaring filled his ears . Choked by the blast of gunpowder , he watched the tomahawk falter in its descent , caught the look of stunned surprise in the Choctaw 's face as his knees buckled . Spread-eagled in the palmettos , with a full charge of buckshot in his chest , Red Shoes made a last , angry effort to rise . With the death rattle in his throat , he was still the epitome of his race , still eager for a white victim . John 's heel ground the tomahawk into the earth as his enemy gave a last , convulsive shudder . Faith , kneeling on the edge of the rifle pit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , though her cheeks were pale enough . " I told you I could load as well as any man , " she said . Still on one knee , with the wood-smoke stench of the dead Indian in his nostrils , John continued to stare open-mouthed . " How did you get here ? " " I can crawl like an Indian too , " she said . " Are n't you glad I joined you ? " " You might have been killed , Faith --  " " So might you . In fact , that hatchet missed your head by inches . " He got to his feet to stare wildly at the battlefield . Smoke still hung above the breastworks , but the riflemen had moved into the open . John had a glimpse of Obadiah , in the act of lifting enemyp192hair ; he saw Colonel Larkin , a clubbed rifle in his fists , go charging into a thicket to smash the skull of another would-be murderer . Turning aside with no desire to complete the ghastly inventory , he put out a hesitant hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not quite believe she was real . Or that she had knelt there , just behind him , at the moment he needed her most . " First Yulee , now you , " he said . " It 's more than I deserve . " " Why should n't I save your life , John ? " she asked . " Is n't that what wives are for ? " Perhaps she had n't lifted her lips for that reason , but it seemed perfectly natural to kiss her . The moment cried out for jubilation . Faith rested but an instant in his arms before she moved toward the inner circle of tents  --  alive with children 's wailings , now that the threat of doom had receded . Falling into step beside her , John gave her hand a final , grateful pressure . Someday , he would thank her as she deserved  --  he had no words this morning . Certainlythis was not the time or place to confess that she might have saved him for another woman.  |p196Ax  and machete had carved their path through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those same trail breakers in the densely forested lowlands that spread , like an endless apron , from the flanks of the mountain wall to the north . It had been a hardslogging , backbreaking month  --  an interval when the mind was too numbed by distance to think beyond the next bend in the trail , the next brambled hillside . They had crossed gullies and ravines where the brush was thick enough to shut out the sky , and the markings of the Middle Path were almost too faint to follow ; they had wallowed through bogs where only the compass enabled them to tell north from south , where quicksands bubbled beside the trail and leeches by the dozens fastened to their flesh . For three blessed days they had marched through a great , park-like glade that , Obadiah insisted , marked the dividing line between Choctaw and Creek , a neutral ground untouched by Indian moccasin . Here , they had dared to steal a short rest while the stock was watered and childrenromped . Finally , as the second month of their pilgrimage began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves looking down on a brown prairie , already sere in the June sunlight . Behindthem , to the northeast , the outposts of the great Appalachianchain were only blue mirages . Ahead , the pine barrens seemed to stretch into a dusty infinity , until they merged with the heat haze on the eastern horizon . Riding a bit ahead of the cavalcade , with Yulee and Obadiahp196on either side , John eased his mount to a stop and opened the map case on his pommel . He had reined in by design , for there was no real need to halt . The Path was in plain view on the flank of the hillside . Still , it had seemed a natural spot to pause , now that another phase of their journey lay before them . Without glancingback , he knew that the marchers had settled to the earth , glad of this short respite . The Romans map on his knee was a memory book of sorts  --  as accurate as the log Evan Wright had kept so meticulously in his leather-bound diary . For no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already covered , rather than the unknownhazards ahead . Here ( for a starter ) was the neat red cross that marked their short and bloody meeting with the Choctaw marauders . He needed only to close his eyes to see that field again , strewn with windrows of Indian dead , and the breastworks where Red Shoes lay tumbled , as grotesquely as a broken toy . In a very real sense that would-he massacre had marked the start of their journey . It had been followed by his election as leader ; the load that had settled on his shoulders that day had been a tangible thing . . . . It had also marked the division of the company , since nearly fifty members of their group ( shaken to their souls by the Indian attack and visioning worse dangers ahead ) had chosen to turn back to Natchez and throw themselves on the mercy of the Spaniards . As Obadiah had said , it was a crisis that occurred in every wildernesscamp , a time when the men are separated from the boys . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen captain these thirty days were the stuff o which empire-builders are made . It was strange that this flight from Natchez was retracing its footsteps , as it were , to wind back through the wilderness to an older , safer world . Now that they had been tested by the trail , John felt that his companions could have marched to the Pacific , had they so willed . It was doubly strange that he ( of all possiblep197leaders ) should head this column today . Or that he should have found his dedication there , his reason for being . He glanced back just once before he returned to the map , and his usual conference with Obadiah . There was Faith ( in the vanguard , as always ) chatting with the Beasleys  --  Faith , who had saved his life in the Choctaw attack and had preserved his sanity no less surely in the days that followed . Though she did not look up , he could tell that she felt his eyes ; he looked away with a feeling akin to guilt . With a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face each problem as it arose on this endless journey ; he had learned that most problems could be solved , once they were tackled squarely . The problem of Faith herself , when they found that all journeys had an ending , was another matter . Stella , he saw , was marching with the Hammonds today ; at the moment , she was charming the two Hammond girls with some fanciful tale that had already sent them into gales of laughter . Now that the migrants had turned southward , both Stella and Faith had discarded their buckskin kirtles in favor of cooler homespuns ; thanks to the merciless sun , Stella had long since tanned as darkly as Faith . Still , there was no mistaking that patrician figure in the cluster of sunbonnets beside the Middle Path . A stranger blunderinginto their midst would have guessed instantly that this was a queen in transit , for all her dust-caked garb  --  a queen who gave few commands , yet expected them to be obeyed . John began to check distances on the map , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as he could judge , they had covered more than half the distance to their first objective , the Creek town of Talassee , where he hoped to find an ally in the person of the nation 's king , Alexander McGillivray . Once at Tal/assee , he told himself solemnly , his obligation to these migrants would end . If McGillivray 's people proved friendly ( as they must ) , there would be guides and horses to take them on the last lap of their journey to Augusta or East Florida . What came after , when he had resigned his post as trail captain , was something he would face when the time arrived . Today , he could only be thankful for the responsibilities of leadership , for the endless details of the march that combined to shut out all thoughts of the future . While they were still deep in the barrens of the Middle Path , with survival itself in doubt , he could refuse to concern himself with tomorrow , or any reality more distant than their next bivouac . True , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear . Indians had skulked on their flanks , while they worked out of Bed Shoes ' country ; but these had been mere shadowy pilferers , not daring to show their faces by daylight . When they reached the glade that divided the two nations , even this petty marauding had ceased . Now , more than ever , John was convinced that Red Shoes had been no more than a maverick , disowned by the responsible chieftains of his tribe . Like Chris Martin , there had been no one who cared to avenge his demise . The expected threat of sickness had also failed to materialize , beyond the inevitable aches and pains of a long journey . Ralph Otis had suffered a broken arm after the Indian attack , but the bone had knit snugly . Old Amos Dexter ( who had been the Wrights ' overseer at Trail 's End ) had pulled a tendon on their last climb down from the mountain country ; he rode on horseback today , beside Hal Duffy and the younger Borland bo ' ; , whose teeth still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these had been the only casualties . The most trying problem in the past few days had been a persistentshortage of water  --  and , as an inevitable corollary , a scarcity of game . The easy days of the Trace , when the outriders had never failed to bring in deer or partridge at day 's end , seemed remote as Eden now . Thanks to this early-summer drought , mostp199of the game had retreated to the coolness of the mountains ; the water holes Obadiah remembered from former trips through this region had been bone-dry . Even the upper branches of the Tombigbee ( which he recalled as roaring freshets ) had been reduced to mere muddy trickles . Thirst was never far from them , the need to find water a sharper goad than any fear of a second Indian attack . They had marched on short rations all of yesterday  --  and the vista ahead was hardly encouraging , though the sight of open country was a welcome change after their weeks in the piedmont . John looked up from his musings as he heard Obadiah stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had covered close to three hundred miles in that long ( and sometimes heartbreaking ) month , perhaps half their total journey . Yet other tests awaited them before they could set foot on the track to Talassee . He could understand why the Kentuckian was anxious to put that sun-bitten plain behind them . " How far to the Tombigbee ? " " Three days , at the outside , " said Obadiah . " That is , if the fine weather holds  --  and our tongues ai n't dragging in the dust . I would n't have prayed for rain in the hills , but I 'll put in a request right now for an old-fashioned cloudburst . This neck of the woods could do with a soaking , same as us . " John nodded sober agreement . The fine summer weather had been a blessing in the hills , so long as springs were abundant ; even on the hottest days , it had been possible to water the stock adequatelyat each campsite . Now , with a three days ' drive in prospect before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had encountered since the Mississippi ) , the threat of drought was ominously real . " Any chance of finding a spring before sunset ? " " You wo n't believe it , Doc , but we 'll turn up water by nightfall . See that line of trees  --  yonder to the right ? I 've camped there more'n once , when I was hunting in these foothills . It 's a prime spot for game , when the fens still hold the rain . "  | " They 'll be powder-dry now . " " An all-weather spring feeds down to that hammock from higher ground . You 'll see it plain enough , once the trail has crossed the next hump . What say we head out and prove I 'm right ? " John lifted his hand to signal the resumption of the march before he followed the Kentuckian over the last ridge of the foothills . Yulee wheeled in at the head of the column , which heaved up from the grass with a precision that was almost military . These weeks on trail had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long practice in surmounting the perils of the MiddlePath had given each member the precision of a puppet . Faces were haggard with fatigue today , and dust lay thick on every shoulder when the column snaked out into the plain . But there was no word of complaint to cloud the purpose of that final , drivingpace . The migrants had long since learned to conserve their breath for the last , bone-shaking hour before making camp . Obadiah and John reached their selected bivouac just before sunset . As the Kentuckian had promised , there was abundant grass in this cleft ; thanks to the all-weather spring which bubbled in a rocky cup , the vale had been spared from the parching heat of the barrens that surrounded it . It was a blessed relief to unsaddle both mounts , and watch them roll beside the spring  --  to stretch one 's own limbs before preparing cook fires , and staking out tent sites against the arrival of the main column . There was time to splash naked in a pool below the spring , while the dust cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions . Lolling in the delicious coolness of the water , John felt his mind drift back to quieter times . . . The b ek gardenof his home in Germantown , filled with the murmur of bees and the whisper of the brook that ran through his father 's apple orchard . The Schuylkill in the rain , after a day 's fishing in his brothers ' skiff : he could still remember their boyish shouts of glee , as they had lifted their faces to that refreshment , after hours of parching heat . . . . Were those brothers still alive today  --  and had the war they had fought so valiantly ended at last ? It seemed un/likely that their paths would cross again . But he no longer felt an uneasy stir of shame when he thought back to the adventures they had shared . He , too , had earned his victories ; they would have no right to reproach him now . " I 'll give odds it rains by morning , " said Obadiah , as they sunned themselves dry on the grassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barometer says . Did you know I carry one in my carcass ? " " Do n't tell me I overlooked a bit of lead at Fort Panmure . " " This is a bullet in my right shin  --  a present from a Shawnee . Never know it 's there , until the weather changes . Then it starts teasing the bone a mite . Right now , it 's talking of thunderstorms . " John smiled drowsily at the news . Evan Wright 's glass had fallen several points since morning ; it was good to find that a human barometer had registered the same change . Stretching mightily before he donned his clothes , he offered the Kentuckian the last of his Havana segars ; they had been husbanded rigorously for this moment of repose at the end of a long day 's drive . Obadiah had already poured two pannikins of his favorite potion from a jug in his saddlebags . " Here 's to the Tombigbee  --  and a safe crossing . " " Ca n't ask for everything , Doc . If it rains here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be lucky if that river 's inside its banks when we fetch it . " The Kentuckian continued to grin , despite the gloom of his prediction . " Reckon we can swim as good as we can walk ? " " Right now , I 'd call it a welcome change . Still , I would n't frighten the others until we 're sure . " " Believe me , it 'd take a lot to spook these folks now . They 've turned into first-rate trail beaters . They 'll more'n likely be good mud turtles too . " Obadiah 's rain had not come when the camp settled for the night , a scant half-hour after sundown . At each bivouac , it seemed , the tents were up faster than before , the last fire lighted in record time . But the near-picnic mood of the Trace had long since been replaced by a harsher reality . There was no singing tonight , andp202even the pre-supper games of the children were muted by weariness . In a matter of minutes , it seemed , the tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its blanket of oblivion ; the footfalls of the pickets ( pacing the higher ground to the north , the lip of green earth where dale and prairie met ) were the only sound to break the repose of the summer night . John had long since trained himself to plummet into sleep the moment he had murmured a good night to Faith . Tonight , he was more angered than startled to find himself wide awake , a few hours after he had slipped under his poncho . He knew instantly that a far-off crash of thunder had roused him , though the distantbooming had not intruded on Faith 's repose . The thunder repeated as he raised on one elbow . Apparently the storm was building in the mountains , for the thrust of the hillock above the camp had blacked out the glimmer of the lightning . Only a spatter of rain had touched them so far , stirring an acrid odor of dust in the bone-dry ground outside the camp . It was quite possible that the rain would skirt this area entirely , to follow one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothills of whose southern terminus lay a little to the north . Cursing the vagaries of weather , John prepared to compose himself for sleep again , when he saw that Obadiah had jr t come into camp . There was no mistaking his tall , stooped figure ' as he paused before the central fire , then moved toward John 's own tent . " Hoped that , thunder had wakened you , Doc . Better come to the hilltop ; there 's something I 'd like you to see . " Knuckling the sleep from his eyes , John stumbled along in the Kentuckian 's wake . When they stood together on the spine of the ridge that fenced their camp to the north and west , he rubbed hisp203eyes a second time to wipe out the unwanted vision . The solid wall of flame was still there when he looked again  --  a towering red wall that seemed to rumble closer with each breath , to lift and rear until the sky itself was part of its almost incandescent glow . He had seen other forest fires blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had watched from a place of safety , where he could savor the infernal drama . Tonight , with the breeze from the north and the fire raging on the last slopes of the foothills , he saw that the slash pines on the prairie itself would soon ignite . Standing here on the ridge , with the bushy green sea of the barrens before him , he could feel the breath of that distant blaze  --  as though some demon from the underworld was pumpinga monster bellows , and chuckling darkly at his work . " Any idea how it started ? " " Must have been the storm . Was n't enough rain to taste down here , but there were lightning bolts to spare . One bolt in a dead tree would spark that sort of tinder . " " Any chance it may pass us by ? " " Not if that breeze holds . Once the pine woods catch , they 'll burn like torches . " " No use to break camp and try outrunning it ? " Obadiah shook his head . " Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little green wood around us . Not that it 'll stay green for long , if there ai n't some rain mixed with that wind . " John 's mind , shocked wide awake by this not unexpected threat , had already jumped ahead of the Kentuckian 's whispered estimate . The cordon of live oaks surrounding their camp was still green enough to resist that fearful heat , if the fire itself could somehow be deflected from the ravine . But if it rolled unimpeded to the edge of camp , it would devour them as casually as so many spitted birds before an open furnace . " There 's one chance left , " John said . " Well have to backfire . " " Wind 's right powerful , Doc . What if the main blaze catches up ? "  | " We 'll burn the underbrush in strips . The first fire can start at the top of the ravine . Are you afraid to try it ? " " Not me , " said the Kentuckian . " Just wanted to make sure you saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasting ? " " Go rouse the camp , " said Obadiah promptly . He was already kneeling beside a clump of dry grass , to pour out a pinch of powder from his horn . Shielding the area with his body , he struck the barrel of his rifle a quick , glancing blow with his hunting knife . Sparks leaped into the windy air ; on the secondtry , the powder flared , igniting a ready-made torch , which the Kentuckian plucked from the earth . " Bring out your firemen , Doc . We 'll need ' em in the next hour . " John did not pause to watch Obadiah range down the curve of the ravine , setting a man-made conflagration as he ran . There was no time to break the news gently to the camp below . Indeed , more than one tent was now astir , as sleeping migrants began to flair the smoke . A dozen men were running to help the Kentuckian before John could bark his first orders . The spout of flames , as the fat lightwoods just outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already rivaled the howling menace to the north . It was John 's plan to set his first fires not more than fifteen feet apart . Thanks to the organization of the camp ( which had lived and worked by groups since the first day ) , it was easy to assign men to these separate tasks . The older boys were sent to gentle the pack horses . It was too much to hope that they could avoid a stampede if the fire really entered the camp  --  hut John meant to salvage what he could of the string . jRacing to the top of the ravine again , he had a glimpse of Faith , already wide awake and calling orders of her own to the boys . He had assumed that she would take over the leadership of that area . The children of the camp were used to following her , however much they might wish to join the men on the fire lanes . A band of flame several yards wide was already crackling at thep205top of the ridge . Beyond , where the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizzling into combustion . John had forgotten how solidly a pine tree could burn , once it was fairly ignited . It was as though the core of fire , blooming like a bloodredrose in the tree 's heart , had waited until the last possible instant before exploding into a geyser of sparks and hissing coals . Not all the trees had caught . here and there , a gaunt sentinel remained . But their margin of safety was widening fast , as new backfires were laid clown in ever-widening half-circles . At the same time , another group of torchbearers , working in a broad Vpatternon both sides of the ravine , were establishing a second barrier . In the next half-hour , the entire company was soot-blackened to the eyes . Women and children , working within the camp itself , dampened the grass along the ravine and stood ready to snuff out wind-blown sparks . The wide , free-burning V 's , arrowing away to the south , were laying down their own paths of destruction in the piney woods below the camp , but they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The critical point was still the head of the ravine , which would receive the full onslaught of the flames . John and his cohorts had now established a backfire perhaps two hundreds yards in depth  --  a roaring threat of its own that all but invaded the camp at times . A few clumps of bushes , ignited by spontaneous combustion within the ravine , were allowed to burn themselves out , thus increasing the area of scorched earth . Once the main blaze was upon them , everything burnable within that green hollow would be a deadly threat . The men on the outer circles worked for the most part in sweatingsilence . The only sound to lift above the roar of that holocaust to the north was the scream of a horse , signaling that yet another animal had broken the cordon and charged into the night . Now and again , John had a glimpse of Faith  --  a soot-blackened Amazon , her voice raised in a warning to her youthful charges . Oddly enough , he had no thought that she might be in danger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know when anp206animal could be roped into submission  --  and when it was impossible to stop another charge into the red-rimmed dark . Stella had joined the fire fighters at the northern end of camp  --  where it was difficult , at times , to distinguish the backfires from the bubbling hell-broth beyond . If Faith seemed a bit larger than life tonight , Evan Wright 's wife was insubstantial as a wraith as she hurried to do her part . But there was no mistaking Stella 's dogged courage  --  or the fury with which she charged upon each fresh tongue of flame . More than once , in that panting half-hour , John found an excuse to cross her path , while he hurried to fulfill his own tasks . There was no time to speak , or even to advertise his presence ; but he knew she had been lifted up with the others , in that communal drive toward survival . The main blaze was marching upon them with terrible speed  --  exploding the piney woods tree by tree , raging across the swampland , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a war beyond mortal ken . The backfire still seemed a pitiful obstacle in the face of that red juggernaut . Working in the last of the burned-over bands , with Ned Beasley at his side , Obadiah ranging to the other flank , and Yulee behind him , John saw that they had accomplished what they could . He cupped his hands in an order to retire ; it was time to gain their defenses ( such as they were ) or risk blundering into a trap withoutan exit . Obadiah echoed the order from his own singed whiskers . The air was full of shouted curses , all but drowned by the detonations of the blaze , as the men yielded their posts one by one in the general retreat to the ravine . Calling for Beasley to follow , John turned back with the others . He had run perhaps fifty yards with the pressure of the holocaust like an incubus on his shoulders , before he realized that he was alone . " Where are you , Ned ? " There was no answer when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a groan , somewhere in the sooty darkness behind him . Despite the glare , it was hard to see clearly , because ofp207the billows of greasy smoke that had begun to roll before the blast . There was no mistaking the groan when it came again , though he could not locate it precisely . From that distance , it resembledthe cry of a wounded animal . All kinds of game had coursed through their backfire in the past hour  --  deer , rabbits , woodchucks , a pugnacious hog or two . " Are you there , Ned ? " John called again . This time , the groan seemed to rise from the ground at his feet . He stumbled into the path of the fire , and all but tripped on Beasley 's body . The man was sprawled beside a stumphole  --  one of those treacherous , rotted-out pits impossible to avoid in the dark . Stunned by the violence of his fall , the major did no more than moan faintly as John knelt to examine him . Ned 's foot had evidently crashed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ankle . " Up you come . We 'll have to move fast . " Despite his thin frame , Beasley was a dead weight in his arms as John struggled to lift him on one shoulder . He forced himself to kneel there in the soot , while Ned 's mind groped back to consciousness : without an effort on his part as well , they would both perish . " Leave me lay , Doe . You 'll never make it . " " We 're making it together , Ned . " Beasley struggled feebly , and managed to raise himself on his good leg , until his body was draped over John 's shoulder , and one fist had anchored in John 's belt . It took a bone-cracking effort , but John managed to stagger to his feet . Already the smoke was so thick it was impossible to pick out landmarks : he could only guess at the location of the camp . But there was no time to seek out directions now : the roaring wall of destruction behind them took care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than once ( as he stumbled there , ankle-deep in soot and glowing cinders ) John found himself teetering on the brink of other stumpholes , or recoilingfrom thickets that still made minor holocausts of their own.  |p208The  hell-mouth of the major conflagration sucked at his heels with a thousand tongues . He felt his shirt catch fire , and knew that Ned was doing his poor best to beat out the blaze . For one dreadful moment , John was sure he had circled the ravine , only to blunder into the flaming cul-de-sac to the south . Then he stumbled in earnest , and knew he had reached the grassy margin of the camp . Willing hands relieved him of his burden , and with no sense of transition he somehow managed to limp across the rim of the ravine , where he pitched into Faith Gordon 's arms . The roaring of the fire was still in his ears as he slipped gently into limbo . He was aware of voices and bustle all around him and knew he had not quite fainted , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank gratefully and looked up into Faith 's begrimed face . Her eyes , he saw , were red from smoke , her hair wild as that of some Valkyrie fresh from combat . " They reached you just in time , " she said . " Ned Beasley 's clothes were already burning . " " He beat out mine-when they caught . Is he -- - ? " " They carried him to the spring . Obadiah said he 'd be all right . " Faith looked up when a figure John dimly recognized as Colonel Larkin loomed above them . " What about Dr. Wright ? " she asked , in a quick whisper . " We got him back , " Larkin said hoarsely . " A little singed , that 's all . " John attempted to sit up , but his head began to swim , so violentlyhe was grateful for the cradle of Faith 's arms . " What happened to Dr. Wright ? " " He heard that you and the major were still out there  --  and tried to find you . The others stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed nearer than ever now . John could feel its deep , panting breath in the air above him , and understood the stormy heaving of the bosom where his head was pillowed . Like himself , Faith was finding it hard to breathe in the partial vacuum created by the back draft of the blaze . He tried to sit uprightp209again , but the wave of dizziness returned . He was glad to let her restrain him with arms that seemed , for the moment , far stronger than his will . " I must see about Dr. Wright and Ned . " " You 've been hero enough for one night , " said Faith brusquely . " If you 'd swallowed a bit more smoke , they 'd never have found you . " What about the fire ? " " It 's passing around the ravine now . " He found that he could lift his head enough to observe the solid ring of men along the sides of the ravine , with pails and dampened blankets poised , ready to beat down the showers of sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . Even from where he lay , it was apparent that the blaze had exhausted itself , on the threshold of the backfire they had carved out with such backbreaking toil . Already , the core of the holocaust had moved down the long arrows of the Vs they had burned on the ravine 's flanks . " Yulee was on his way to rescue Ned , " said Faith , still with more than a hint of anger in her voice . " Why did you have to outrun him ? " Before he could frame an answer , Stella Wright came into his fast-clearing vision . She knelt on the bank beside him , her face white and her eyes bright with concern . " Evan sent me , Faith , " she said . " To see how he was . " John stirred in Faith 's tight embrace and felt her arms relax at last . This time , he found he could sit up after a fashion . " There 's nothing wrong with him that a good dose of fresh air wo n't cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense . " He saw the two women 's glances meet . Had his thoughts been clearer , he might have understood the smile that passed between them for what it really was . " Now we 're on the subject , " he said , as he got to his feet , " 1 ' 11 have a look at Dr. Wright myself . " With Faith steadying his arm and Stella close on the other side ,  |p210he  circled the spring to where Ned Beasley and the old doctor lay . Ned 's ankle was a clean break , as he had hoped  --  the kind of fracturethat could be held easily with splints to insure a good union of the bone . Evan Wright lay propped up against a saddle , with a pad of blankets under his shoulders . His lips were bloodless and his face devoid of color , but his eyes were brightly alert . John grinned as he knelt to examine his colleague . " They tell me you made a hero of yourself , sir , " he said . Dr. Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out there with the major , I seem to have lost my head . Still , my impulse was sound . These people could hardly go on without their leader . " Faces were thick about them now , as the fire fighters drew back from their work : John spoke for their benefit as well as Evan always need you far more than me . " " It 's good of you to say that , John , but --  " " No buts , sir . People need strong hearts as well as bodies on a march like this . I 'll do my best to guide their feet , but you must give them heart . That 's why you 've got to take a little better care of : ' ourself . " A rumble of thunder , followed by a quick spurt of rain , wrote its own signature to the moment . Stella bent quickly to help her husband to their tent . As john called for men to move Ned Beasley , he saw Faith stoop forward to assist the old doctor too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand to their own shelter , but they could still join in the cheers that rose on all sides at this timely intervention of the elements . Once it was under way , Obadiah 's downpour proved worthy of the name . Rain was still pelting from a darkened skyp211when the migrants took to the trail in the dawn . Ned Beasley , with his splinted ankle in a sling hooked to his saddle horn , rode in the vanguard today , between the Kentuckian and Yulee ; Evan Wright came next , his white warlock lifted to the deluge , his voice raised bravely in a hymn of thanksgiving the whole cavalcade was singing from overflowing hearts . With each step the marchers took , the miracle of their survival was more apparent . The wide swathe of the fire , reduced long since to sodden ashes , had spent its force in the hammocks to the south . As far as the eye could reach , the rain-wearied landscape resembled nothing so much as a colossal frying pan , neglected too long by some drunken cook . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay on trail , resembled a file of gnomes before the first hour 's march was behind them . Like underground demons , they seemed to walk in a gray-green gloom that was neither earth nor water , though it partook of the worst features of both . It was only with afternoon that the humid half-light dissolved a bit along the horizon 's rim , and Obadiah was able to take his bearings . So far as they could judge , they had waded a bare dozen miles from their campsite . The compass told them that they were still working their way south by east , in the general direction of the Tombigbee . In the aftermath of last night 's disaster , one mile was much like another . Even when they paused at last to gnaw on a makeshift meal of corn pone and jerked venison , it was impossible to believe that they would outmarch the fire 's fury on the morrow . More than half of their pack horses had been lost at the ravine  --  and they had been forced to abandon much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough mounts for the sick and wounded . Essential articles , such as sacks of flour and the powder and shot that would be invaluable when they had outmarched the region of drought and found game again , were carried by human pack horses now . The hard cash they had brought from the Mississippi still jingled in Evan Wright 's saddlebags ; the men of the party shoulderedp212their share of pelts , grievous though the burden was . Once they had crossed the Tombigbee , it was John 's plan to head straight for the next river on the map , the Tascaloosa . Here , it might be possible to raft their burdens downstream to the junction with the Koosah , near whose bank Talassee stood . Long before they gained this objective , he hoped to replenish their stores , and to buy fresh pack animals in one of the Indian towns of that region . Rain had been still pelting down when they took to the trail , after their dreary encampment . It was falling when they climbed to higher ground , and left the ravages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Path ( though it had long since ceased to deservethe name ) was now a mere muddy trough in the forest bed . At times , it threatened to dissolve entirely , and change into anotherof those deep-walled creeks that flowed to join the Tombigbee . At least they were making progress of a sort  --  or so John reasoned , as he rode back from scouting the country ahead , and surrenderedhis horse to a foot-weary marcher . Chins were still held high , and there was no audible murmur of complaint , beyond the wailing of tired children , or the sigh of exhaustion that escaped some ancient for whom no horse was now available . It was good to hear the shout of joy that ran down the cavalcade when the sun broke through at day 's end , revealing another stretch of open country at the top of the long rise . Next morning the trail was well marked again , the march easy  --  but it was four days , not three , before they began their actual approach to the river . The Tombigbee 's current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing of the downpOur that had deluged its own valley . Thanks to the bluffs that confined it at this point , it had yet to overflow its bed , but the ford marked on the map had long since been covered . John needed but a glance at the heavily forested banks to realize that it would be necessary to spend a day in camp , while the party was rafted through that turbulent current , and the horses swum across . With woodsmen by the dozens in their ranks , it was no problemp213to construct a floating platform large enough to accommodate twenty-odd passengers . Built of halved timbers , with a lashing of dry logs beneath , their raft was hardly a thing of beauty  --  and , despite the number of willing hands , it had taken a long , sunburnedday to convince Yulee and Obadiah that it would prove seaworthy . Both of these rivermen agreed that the actual crossingshould wait until the clear light of morning . Since several trips would be required to transport the party and its gear , it was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the cavalcade could enjoy a well-earned rest . " Let 's hope this is the last big leapfrog , " said the Kentuckian . " Country 's easy enough beyond , until we hit the Tascaloosa . Indiansshould be friendly , too , once they 've found this is an English party on its way to the Savannah . " " Friendly enough to sell us horses and provisions ? " " Why not , when you were asked by McGillivray to be head doctorto the nation ? " John sighed wearily , as he stepped aboard the raft to test its balance , there in the heavy current . " I hope you 're right , Obadiah , " he said . " Now that I look back , my talk with McGillivray seems to belong in another world . Right now , I ca n't push my mind beyondtomorrow 's crossing . " " A good leader wins his battles one at a time , " said the Kentuckian . " The one we 'll fight tomorrow may be worse than it looks from here . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing now . " With a cheering audience to mark their progress , Obadiah and the half-breed stripped to the waist and spurred two pack horses down the steep descent to the raft . Forcing their mounts to wallowinto deep water , they kicked free of their saddles and swam side by side with the animals , guiding them as best they could to the far bank . Viewed from this angle , the crossing seemed easy enough , if one discounted a moment in midstream , where the horses seemed all but helpless in the spin of the current . John could well understand the excitement among the younger membersof the cavalcade , to whom a tussle with the Tombigbeep214seemed a welcome change from the dust of the trail . For his part , he slept uneasily that night , wishing that the ordeal of the raft was behind them . Men and gear made the first crossing on the raft next morning , with Yulee leaning on one of the guide poles and John himself snubbing hard with another . By giving their vessel its head in midstream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slackened , then spin the rocking platform into quiet water along the eastern shore . Here , by leaning on the poles , a landing was managed , on a gently shelving beach that gave , in turn , to a meadow deep in summer grass . John breathed a sigh of profound relief , now that his own trial run was behind him . The scene ahead was a peaceful one . Several of their pack animals ( swum across by Yulee and his wranglers just after dawn ) were grazing in the fetlock-deep grass , and axes rang cheerfully in a bower of live oaks . Walking into cool shade after the unloading , John saw that the early arrivals had staked out a perfect campsite  --  an amphitheater perhaps two hundred yards in diameter , framed in mossy greenery and cheerful with the bubblingof a spring . It seemed a good augury for the days ahead that they should have blundered into this pleasant glade . Perhaps it was the refreshment of that glimpse , joined to the intense activity of the next two hours  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four trips were needed to transport the men of the party . Though the children begged to come aboard each time , John forced himself to refuse their pleas , until he felt more adept at this cumbersome ferry service . All but two of the horses were swum across in the raft 's wake . Before noon , their new camp was a solid reality . Only the women of the party and a dozen young ones now remained on the western side of the river . The fifth and sixth ferry ride brought the mothers safely across , leaving Stella and Faith with the restless children , and a rider for each of the two horses . John gave Evan Wright a reassuring salute as he stood knee deep in the shallows , to help ease the raft into the Tombigbee forp215its final crossing . A towpath of sorts had long since been hacked out along the bank , permitting the two boatmen to jockey the ferry upstream for its return . Here , the old doctor paused briefly , with one hand lifted to shield his eyes from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought Stella and Faith on that last trip , John . " " They refused to leave the nursery . The children will be quieter if they 're aboard . " " You take account of everything , my boy . " " Not quite everything , sir . It was Faith 's idea to wait for the final crossing , not mine . " On the east bank , a dozen small fry swarmed aboard with eager shouts , almost before Yulee could step ashore to help . After he had given a hand to Faith and Stella , John placed his passengers with care . Compared with their earlier trips , the raft seemed underladenfor this final duel with the Tombigbee : it was necessary to place stones on the platform to trim ship , and the children were ordered to remain in the center , with folded arms . Easing into the current one more time , with the two horses blowing noisily in their wake , John felt the pole in his fists lose contact with the bottom , and set himself for the moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river . What happened next came too fast for conscious thought . He had not realized that one of the horses had lost its head in that plunge for deep water , or that it had shaken free of its rider . Beforeeither he or Yulee could brace themselves , the fear-crazed animal had come abreast of the raft with forefeet raised . With a high , banshee whinny , its hoofs crashed down upon the platform , missing the half-breed by inches , and sending their ballast to the bottom . The sudden pressure , combined with the loss of their ballast , had thrown the raft into a near-fatal yaw . Yulee , dropping his pole , spread arms and legs in time to save the children from pitching into the river . John , by leaning hard on the far side ,  |p216managed  to right the platform after a fashion , until they were drifting toward shore again . He saw that the discarded rider , swimming far astern , could never come to their assistance . The second horseman had dropped even farther behind , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching the maddened horse prepare to charge again , John knew there would be no way to keep the raft from capsizing . A shout rose from the bank ; he felt the raft bound beneath him and realized Faith had plunged overside , that she was swimming in the path of those lethal hoofs . He saw the russet head submerge in time to dodge the expected blow , watched it pop into view again , on the animal 's flank . With that maneuver , Faith had somehow knotted the reins in one fist . The first toss of the horse 's head almost lifted her clear of the river ; on the second toss , both animal and girl vanished briefly in a welter of foam  --  but the strip of water between raft and animal was steadily widened . On the third try , Faith jerked the horse 's head below surface and forced him to change course . One foot was in a stirrup now , a free fist knotted in the mane . With an incredulous gasp , John saw that she had lifted a leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back . For an instant more she clung to her dangerous perch , whispering into the cocked-back ears , controlling the horse 's efforts to buck free with the knees of the born rider . Then , permittingthe head to lift again , she drifted into slack water , where mount and rider swam calmly to the bank . Half waiting for the expected cheer from shore , John was startled to hear a babble of advice instead . He under'stood when he heard a faint cry from midstream and saw that Stella had somehowbeen pitched into the Tombigbee at the same moment that Faith had made her dive . Now , clinging to a bit of driftwood that had spun within her reach , she seemed unable to quarter into the current , or even to lift above the swirling surface . " Steady the raft , Yulee ! I 'm going after her . " John plunged as he spoke , a long , raking dive that carried himp217free of the raft  --  just before that clumsy vessel , turning in a last , crazy spin , slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he swam downstream and saw that Faith had already dismountedand was wading hip-deep in the eddies to help with the landing : a dozen others had followed promptly to lift the children ashore . Then he kicked off his boots and began swimming after Stella , with all his remaining strength . Afterward , he would remember that he had gone overside with only a passing thought for the safety of his remaining passengers . He would reproach himself bitterly for clinging to the raft when Faith had plunged to save them all  --  only to leave it , like a copybooklifeguard , to help Stella Wright ashore . And only a deeper probe of his emotions would reveal his assurance , even then , that Faith was fitted instinctively ( by both inheritance and training ) to rise to such an emergency , while Stella was not . At the moment , it mattered little to him by what means tragedy had been turned aside ; there was even a comic element in his haste to reach Stella , to steer her impromptu buoy ashore . Hero and Leander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand in his brain . Only this is the Tombigbee , not the Hellespont  --  and neither of us is likely to drown today. 5He swam to the downstream end of the sandbar where the log had stranded at last , careful to stay clear lest it contain quicksand . At first glance , he was sure that Stella had fainted , though she still clung to the driftwood : thanks to that boisterous current , it had been a long and arduous pursuit . Then , as he was about to call her name , she lifted her head and gave him a smile that was half ashamed  --  and totally unafraid . " Just hold on as you 're doing , " he told her . " I 'll work the log ashore . "  |p218Making  sure that she was still tightly anchored , he freed the driftwood from its lodgment , and eased it into the current again . At this point , the eastern bank was too high to make a landing feasible ; he quartered gently toward shore , until he could round the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a crescent of sandy beach . Once he had rounded this promontory , it was a simple matter to trap the log in the backwater at its foot . The log was now far easier to manage ; after a few thrashing kicks , he felt solid bottom under his toes . Stella had continued to cling to the log without attempting to speak while they worked inshore . Now , she lifted her face in anothertremulous smile  --  and swooned dead away , as he rose in waist-deep water and lifted her clear of the river . Her faint , after all , was but a natural reaction to her ordeal ; he knew that she would soon emerge from it . It was only a short walk to dry land , and the sun-warmed beach was clear of debris . A small watercourse , tumbling down a gully to join the Tombigbee , made a cheerful murmur in the background . he placed his burden on the sand , and went to fetch water in a twist of wild grape leaf . Stella opened her eyes before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must look a fright , " she said drowsily . " You never looked lovelier . " It was a compliment from the heart . Disheveled though she was , with daubs of river mud on cheeks and hair , Stella Wright was simply a woman today , a beautiful and desirable woman who bore only a faint resemblance to the mistress of Trail 's End . The eyes that looked up to him now were warm with gratitude  --  and the laughter they were already sharing . " Do you mean that , John ? " " Of course I mean it . " " Then why must I nearly drown myself to be alone with you ? " He knew that much of this was the product of near-hysteria , yet he could not keep down his own response . " For the time being , " he said , " we 've this part of the world to ourselves . Do you mind ? " " Not if we can stay awhile . "  | " I 'm afraid we ca n't linger long . They 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch that log , " she said  --  just a bit too quickly . " Everyone saw you swim after me . " " So they did , " he said , in the same tone of forced lightness . " Should n't we prove their confidence is deserved ? " " How far did we drift ? " " Two miles , at least . " His arm was still beneath her head as he held the water to her lips ; now she put the leafy cup aside to look at him directly . Her eyes were warm , but with an emotion that went far beyond gratitude . " I almost wish it could have been farther , John . What if they never found us ? " He made no attempt to answer her with words . Being no more than human , he could not help being stirred by the eagerness in her eyes , the softness of her half-parted lips  --  and the promise of surrender they offered . And yet , he somehow managed to hold his desire in check  --  for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , " she said . " No one can drift forever . We must go hack . " " Back to camp and the Middle Path , Stella . On to the Koosah and Talassee  --  and what comes after . " " What will come after , John ? " " I do n't know . " " Ca n't I help you to decide ? " She had pulled his head down to hers before he quite realized what the words implied . This time , he could not have resisted her had he tried . The mouth that met his own was warmly demanding  --  and as sweetly eager as he had pictured it . For a moment he returned Stella 's kiss  --  and the steel of his resolve floated away like chaff in the wind . The harsh , laughing cry of a blue jay broke the spell in time . He stared up resentfullyat the bird on a tree branch overhead . The beady , cynical eyes were fixed upon him , for all the world like a sardonic incarnationof conscience . Stella 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of that interruption well enough . It was not integrity that had come between them  --  or the thought of the frail , half-dying husband who awaited her so anxiously upstream . Happenstance alone had kept him from possessing her completely , there on the bank of the Tombigbee . " I suppose we should be starting back to camp , " she said  --  and her tone could not have been more composed , had the whole wide river flowed between them . And yet , for all her apparent poise , she made no move to leave his arms . The blue jay had taken flight long since , but not his conscience . Even now she was daring him to finish what she had begun so recklessly  --  though she knew , in her heart , that their moment of abandon had somehow escaped them . " I suppose we should , " he said . " After all , we 'll both be needed there . " He lifted her in his arms before she could speak again , and carried her along the slope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter how he prolonged them , he knew that each step he took forward was a stride away from temptation . " It 's good to be needed , John , " she said at last . " At times , it can be a burden too . " He set her on her feet at the forest 's edge , where the tangle of water oaks opened to a wide vista of grasslands . " Can you walk , Stella ? " She swayed against him , and he saw the sparkle of tears in her eyes . " Yes , John , " she said . " Too well , perhaps . " He put down his desire , though it took his last shred of will . " Integrity can be a burden too , " he told her . " It 's ore you ca n't surrender . I know you too well for that . " " You 're right , of course , " she said . " We must both bear it  --  for a time . " So her offer was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her arms stole about his neck again . The kiss she had given him beside the river had been born of passion . This time , her lips were more a pledge to the future than an invitation to surrender.  |p221They  were still locked there in each other 's arms when the drum of horses ' hoofs brought them back to the present . At first , it seemed no more than a distant echo from another world . Then , as John stepped from their leafy bower , he saw Faith , riding at a hard gallop across a stretch of grassy prairie to the south . A short distance behind her , Obadiah Hurt was thundering down the edge of the bluff at the same gait . " So they found you at last . I knew they would . " Evan Wright smiled up at them from his vigil at the edge of the camp . Behind him , the migrants stood on the slope of the natural amphitheater , like a group of pilgrims fresh from prayer . The Bible in the old doctor 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went up as John dismounted and lifted Stella down to her husband 's arms . " Faith swore she 'd bring you both back . But we passed an anxioushour , just the same . " Withdrawing a little from the general rejoicing , John could only marvel at his own glib response . " We stranded some two miles downstream , sir . It took them awhile to find us . " Faith had tossed her own bridle to Yulee ; she moved now to join the group . " Usually I 'm a better beagle , " she said . " So , for that matter , is Obadiah . But we knew they were safe ; we saw John steer the log ashore . " John would recall that casual attitude later , along with the look Faith turned in his direction as she settled on a stump and started fanning her brow with the slouch hat she had worn to their rescue . The look spoke a language of its own , had he known it  --  an assurance that she was prepared to accept today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , my dear , " said Evan Wright . " You did bring them safely here again . At least John 's score is perfect now . " " My score , sir ? " John heard his voice enter the discussion . He had meant to hold aloof , as befitted a hero in the making . A hero in name only , he added silently  --  wondering what Evan Wright 's reaction would be , if he knew the facts of that hour downstream . " Do n't you realize you 've brought us through flood and fire and Indian attack without a single casualty  --  if you 'll overlook a broken bone or two , and a few cases of ague ? " John moved to the stump where Faith sat , and grinned solemnly as he knocked wood . " Our journey is n't ended , " he said . " I 'll save my rejoicing for later . " He raised his voice for the benefit of the others , still grouped on the slope above the half-made camp . " In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentries , while daylight 's on our side . " " There 's time to spare for that , " said the old doctor mildly . " We were awaiting your return to hold a service of thanksgiving to God for bringing us safely across the river . Now we have added reason to be thankful . " It was John 's turn to yield , as it were , to an authority higher than his own . He remembered agreeing to Dr. Wright 's suggestion that they open this camp with a prayer . The wish seemed all the more fitting now . Eminently fitting , he thought ( as he knelt with the others ) , in view of the temptation he had just resisted beside the Tombigbee . " With the company 's indulgence , " said Evan Wright , " I will read the Twenty-third Psalm . " John took a quick glance around the circle before h bowed his head . Faith knelt at his side ; Stella knelt just beyon as submissivelyas he , There was no trace of guilt about her , ho hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trail beneath half-lowered eyelids . Larkin and Hammond and Otis with their sunbonneted wives and their young ; the Borland boys and Hal Duffy ; Beasley and his overflowing brood ; the turtle-like solemnity of Amos Dexter ; Yulee 's proud and impassivep223profile ; the solidity of Obadiah Hurt , who clung to his longbarreledflintlock , even in prayer . . .. These are your people , John told himself ; this is the flock you must guard with life itself . Until you 've led them into Talassee , you ca n't forget them for a moment . The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . He leadeth me beside the still waters ! The well-remembered thanksgiving flowed through his mind like a litany , as his lips repeated it , along with a hundred others . Thanks to the alembic of prayer , he could feel himself lifted above the tyranny of self ; for this moment , at least , he could believe that the miracle of their survival would continue to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a miracle was the only way to explain their presence here , without a single death to mark the long flight from Natchez . How else could one justify their escape from the Choctaw tomahawks , their survival in a ring of fire , the rescue of the raft ? How else could he account for the sudden , unreasoning impulse that had made him refuse Stella 's offer of surrender ? How , above all , could he dare to ask for absolution now  --  unless he knelt with the others and knew he came with clean hands ? Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life And I shall dwell in the house of the Lard forever . Faith 's eyes , he saw , were closed tightly ; she was drinking in each word the old doctor was speaking , as he told of the perils they had faced on the trail  --  and gave thanks to an all-wise Power that had granted them safe-conduct . His glance moved on to Stella , in time to see a tear slide down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as he understood Faith 's quiet strength and trust . It was Faith , far more than he , who had helped to bring this cavalcade to safety , he admitted now . From the start , she had putp224the welfare of the group above her own . If she had twice saved his life between Natchez and the Tombigbee , it was to preserve the symbol of the leader , the rallying point . Somehow , he must learn to be worthy of that title  --  though a demon in his soul still reproached him for the opportunity he had lost beside the river.  |p227Seven  days later , traveling by forced marches that began at dawn , they reached the west bank of the Tascaloosa , not too far above the falls . They camped here beside a ford , within sound of the cascade ; the Middle Path was now a well-marked trail , and both Obadiah and Yulee were confident that the Upper Towns of the Creek nation must lie on both banks of the river . It was agreed that John and the Kentuckian would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime , hunters could bring in game to replenish a larder long since reduced to the danger point . The two scouts had departed from camp while the migrants were still plunged in the deep repose that exhaustion brings . It had been an effort for John to wrench himself from his blankets when a sentry called him a half-hour before sunrise ; it had taken courage to wade into a waist-deep stream in the dark , with the thunder of a waterfall not too far below . But he knew that it was necessary to strike qut boldly at this point ; both supplies and transportwere essential , before the cavalcade ventured farther . As Obadiah had expected , they came upon a Creek village below the falls , a silent circle of huts with fish weirs in the pool below the cascade , and acres of cultivated land along the riverbank . The settlement appeared empty , though it was hard to be sure in the darkness . It was often the custom for a village to move en masse , for no reason visible to white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular village should be deserted with corn tall in the furrows , and several canoes at the landing.  |p228Neither  John nor Obadiah were in the mood to complain at this last bit of good fortune as they selected the lightest of the craft for their trip downstream . They could pay for its use later , if the Indians returned . Meanwhile , skimming southward with a breakfastof corn pone and venison under their belts , it had seemed easier to move with the current , and hope that the Creeks would show their faces later . Yawning prodigiously as he studied the riverbank in the sunrise , the Kentuckian had voiced only a mild concern . " ' Course we 're only borrowing this dugout . If the varmints come back unexpected , they might call that a fancy name for stealing . " " Yulee knows the Creek tongue . He 'll explain why we 're camped at the ford . " " Maybe we should have waited for sunup and explored a little . But I reckon you 're still itching to reach the Koosah . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made sure he 'll help us . Our luck wo n't last forever , Obadiah . " " Have it your way , Doc . I 'm not arguing . But there were still fish in those weirs  --  and their corn was waist-high . Why did them Indians move out so fast , along with their dogs ? " 2The mystery was still unsolved in the later afternoon , when the lodge poles of another village showed above the brush . Viewed in broad daylight , the lodges themselves were typically Creek  --  square or rectangular in shape , and constructed of willow withes plastered with the red clay of the region , which had long since dried to the hardness of brick . The roofs were thatched with sun-faded grass , giving the lodges an odd resemblance to crofters ' cottages in Britain . Only the painted birchbark scrolls that framed the doorway of the chief 's hut , and the talking gourds that madep229their own mournful music on the lodge poles , reminded John that this was the dwelling place of a savage people . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in haste . The keel marks of many canoes were visible along the bank , and the lodges had been stripped of their last sleeping mat . John turned to Obadiah for enlightenment , but his companion merely snorted and moved on to explore the perimeter of the town . While he waited for the Kentuckian 's return John continued to circle the hard-packed earth and peered into the empty huts again while he fought down a rising sense of dread . His memories of the Creeks were still fresh ; he had expected a far different receptionin this neatly built village  --  which must have resounded only yesterday to the shouts of naked children sporting at the river 's edge and the slow , even throb of the council drum . Here was the platform where headmen had deliberated from dawn to dark  --  slow-voiced arguments that grew more animated as gourds of the " black drink " circulated , a frothy , aromatic mixture brewed from the cassina shrub , which a visitor sampled at his peril . Here , before a dozen cook fires , squaws had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .. . Did he hear an echo of that laughter from the gourds overhead , or was it only the cry of a nesting heron ? In the past , it had been good to discover that the Indians were a gay and forthright people , when left to their own devices ; he had been proud to share in the Creeks ' games and laughter , since it proved that they had acceptedhim as a brother . He had hoped for such an acceptance today  --  or at least something besides this oppressive silence . Obadiah stalked back to the council ground . " They sure left for keeps , Doc . Any guesses why ? " " Perhaps there 's a powwow at the Hickory Ground . That 's their meeting place on the Koosah . These are summer towns , you know ; the nation generally moves south ahead of bad weather . They could have moved early this year . " " You mean  --  because something besides weather ran ' em out ?  |p230Cherokees  , maybe ? Or Whigs from Georgia ? But there ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been Cherokees , they 'd have burned the town . " " What 's the answer , then ? " " Doc , there 's just one thing that 'll make a whole village hit the trail and leave good food behind . That 's disease . " " You mean , an epidemic ? " " White man 's disease , they call it . Indians think it floats in like fog , and puts a spell on every lodge . I 've seen ' em move out from under that fog overnight . Fact is , they usually go in the dark , so it ca n't follow . " " Have you any evidence to prove that theory ? " " Plenty . And you better hold your nose . " " Half guessing what Obadiah had found , John followed him to a path that led upward from the village . His companion set a brisk pace until they reached the summit of a low ridge . Here , in a clearing open to the four winds , stood a high , stoutly built trestle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before the river breeze had brought to him the sick-sweet odor of death . He needed only a glance at the dozen bodies , tumbled grotesquely on that platform , to see that Obadiah 's proof was definiteindeed . " The ones that lived skedaddled fast , " said his companion . " No wampum or food for the Hunting Grounds ; not even a blanket for the long sleep . Shall I say what killed ' em ? " John shook his head . Only smallpox could strike with such fearfulaftermath . No other disease left those white crusted elevationsas its hallmark . " I 've seen it take whole towns on the Ohio , " said the Kentuckian . " How could it come this far ? " " Traders , maybe . Plenty of ' em work these valleys in summer . Do n't heed but one spark to start that kind of fire . " They had already quitted the place of the dead ; by common consent , they circled the village until they reached their canoe.  |p231John  permitted himself a real breath only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he had been inoculated against this menace while still a student in Edinburgh . " Did you ever take the disease , Obadiah ? " " Had it when I was still a boy . You 'd see the marks , if ' twas n't for these whiskers . That puts me on the safe list , do n't it ? " " By all the rules we know . " " What about yourself ? " " I 'm safe too . I had a mild case in Scotland years ago . " John was still rejoicing at the disastrous threat the migrants had avoided  --  including his choice of Obadiah as a companion on this scout , rather than a possible victim . He could hardly pause to explain the mysteries of inoculation now . The Kentuckian chuckled as he lifted his paddle . He had not quite risked a backward glance at the village ; but he seemed his old self again , now they were in midstream . " Guess the folks in camp are luckier than they know . Leastways , we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We wo n't bring guides or canoes either . " " Look at it this way , Doc . Wherever the disease hit first , it 's moved downriver . Why do n't we march upstream instead of down ? Trail 's broken both ways ; we can dicker for horses instead of boats , and go overland to Talassee  --  or straight for the Savannah . Might be an easier trip at that . It stands to reason it 'd he shorter . " John found that he , too , was more cheerful now . He had looked death in the face , and knew it had many forms ; smallpox , after all , was a more fearful end than most only because the scourge had the power to strike so mysteriously . As Obadiah had said , they had uncovered the threat in time , at no personal risk ; from the migrants ' viewpoint , the epidemic downriver could be a blessingin disguise , if it shortened their journey . Now , more than ever , John would not draw a really tranquil breath again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an islet in midstream ; all the next day , they drove hard for the falls , hoping to reach the camp while daylight lasted . Dusk was falling on the misty pool below the cataract when they sighted the lodge poles of the first deserted village . On this stretch of the Tascaloosa , it was possible to skirt a long stretch of swampland on the eastern bank and avoid the channel entirely . John had just taken his turn at the bow paddle when he heard a shout from his right . To his astonishment , he saw Yulee , waist-deep in the darkening water , in the act of impaling a frog on a homemade spear . On his left shoulder , the half-breed carried a sack heavy with similar prizes ; he deposited his last catch of the day as he waded toward the canoe . " I 've been gigging all afternoon , " he explained . " Dr. Wright is fond of frogs ' legs . " John lifted his paddle , to permit Obadiah to snub the dugout against the swampy bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sun almost down ? " " By no means , je f e . The camp has moved below the falls . " " What are you saying , man ? " John managed to keep his voice calm , though the stab of panic at his vitals was real enough . " Dr. Wright had a slight setback . The hunters had already found a village . It seemed best to Mrs. Wright to put a roof over his head , and post a lookout for your return . " " Get in the canoe , Yulee . We 'll go to him at once . " " He is much better now , Doctor  --  after a day 's rest in bed . " The half-breed tossed his sack over the gunwale , and took the bow paddle from John 's willing hands . " Mrs. Wright hoped to surprise him with a dish of frogs ' legs tonight . She is a fine nurse . " " Did you say bed rest ? " " We carried him across the ford at noon yesterday , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me put your gear in the next lodge . " So the migrants had taken over the deserted village to the last hut . No impulse could have been more natural ; even without Evan Wright 's illness , John could understand the urge that had led them down the path below the falls . After weeks in the wilderness , a Creek lodge would resemble a palace to their tired eyes . The fresh vegetables from those garden patches , the corn in the fields , and the fish weirs below the cascade must have been welcome supplements to the dry rations of the trail . " No sign of the Creeks so far ? " " We found their trail above the falls , sir . It seems they marched overland toward the Hickory Ground . Colonel Larkin is sure they 've gone to a summer powwow . " Clearly , he could not pause to curse the colonel 's error  --  or give way to the tide of panic that had chilled him to the finger ends . Instead , John kept his voice level  --  and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falls . " I hope you 've put out pickets ? " " Of course , Senor Medico . " Yulee sounded faintly hurt . " We were aware that the Creeks might return at any time . Dr. Wright feels that they will be friendly , when they find we can pay well for food and shelter . " The village was in clear view now , its circle of lodges lighted by the flames of cook fires . Despite the fast-fading light , children were swimming in the warm , bubbling pool below the falls  --  whooping with laughter when the thrust of the current sent them tumbling , ignoring calls to supper until the last possible moment . The cavalcade could hardly have looked more settled had it built this village from the first twist of willow withes . Leaping from the canoe before it could ground in the shallows , John felt a deep surge of pity for them all : there was something infinitely touching about that fumble toward hearth and rooftree , after their weeks of sun-bitten marching . He picked out the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried toward it withp234long strides . Greetings were shouted from all sides , but he contented himself with a quick wave of the hand  --  hoping that his face was an adequate mask for his gnawing fear . Stella was seated on the platform before her lodge . A glance across her shoulder told him that Evan Wright was dozing on a pallet of blankets just inside the door . The scene had a domestic note that was oddly restful ; no matter how rude her bivouac on the trail , Stella had always managed somehow to give it the color of home . Mounting the ladder that led to her door , offering a formal salute with the eyes of the camp upon him , John managed a smile , despite his sense of apprehension . " I hear our patient 's better . " " Much , John . Did you have a good trip downriver ? " " That can wait , " he said quietly . " I 'm camp doctor first  --  and then explorer . " Evan Wright came out of his drowse as John knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast but weak , and the older doctor'sskin seemed more transparent than before . But John could see that the setback was not serious . With extended rest , and a nurse like Stella , his colleague was in no real danger at the moment . Whether he would escape the scourge that threatened the whole camp ( if John 's fears were justified ) was a question he could not face as yet . " Is anything wrong , John ? " " Not with you , Doctor . You 're doing famously . " " I feel guilty for making this move without consulting you . Still , it 's done us all a world of good to sleep under a roof again . " " We wo n't argue that , " said John . " Do you mind if I check tonight'spickets before we talk about our scout downriver ? " " There 's something on your mind , " said Stella quickly . " Ca n't you tell us now ? " " Just give me time to make my rounds . I 'll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fumbled for a more reassuring exit.  | " It 's  --  a danger I ca n't explain adequately now . Bear with me  --  I do n't mean to be cryptic . " A little pale afterglow lingered among the pines that bordered the village . John needed only a cursory inspection to make sure that his sentries were well posted ; from the corner of his eye , he saw that Obadiah was conducting a similar check at the far side of camp . At least there was no smell of death about this village ; when he skirted the burial ground ( on a bit of high ground to the north ) he found that the platform was empty of bodies . He could even allow hope to rise that his fears were groundless . It would take no more than a rumor of smallpox downstream to send this village to the bush . " Anything amiss , Obadiah ? " he asked , when the two met in the thickening dusk , just beyond that tenantless place of the dead . " Not so far , Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John nodded , even as he suppressed a groan ; he had forgotten the single hut that was an integral part of these Indian towns , the place of banishment for those beyond help . Obadiah had already taken a path that led into the dense scrub to the north . " Pray God it 's empty . " The lazarette stood in a wide clearing ; even here , it was necessary to give the spirits of the dying room to escape . Above the loweaveddoorway , a torch smoldered in the dusk . The sight of that winking flame ( like a demon 's eye framed in beetling brows ) was enough to confirm his worst doubts . " Do n't tell me they left a medicine man ? " " Yulee said the village was empty , " growled the Kentuckian . " Reckon he did n't scout this far . " John moved forward , snapping a dry branch to make a second torch . Both men recoiled a little when they found themselves facingFaith Gordon  --  a pale , disheveled Faith , whose eyes answered their question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found them yesterday , " she said . " I made him promisenot to tell . " " Stand back , Faith ! "  | " It 's a bit late for that order , John . I had already done what I could to help before I found what was wrong . " She did not add what he knew was true  --  that she would not have run away , even then . John lifted his improvised torch , and stepped under the low roof of the lazarette . Prepared though he was for the sight that met his eyes , he could hardly keep from retching a little  --  though the horror that twisted his heart was for Faith 's sake , not his own . Two Indians ( both so ancient it was hard to tell their sex at first glance ) lay side by side on a pine trestle . Both were skeleton thin ; their eyes were muddy with fever , their skin parchmentyellowrather than red . From forehead to toe , their bodies were almost solidly stippled with the kind of festering sores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evidently they were in the final stages of the disease  --  too weak , in fact , to utter anything beyond the feeblest of moans when the torch struck their faces . " You know what this is , of course ? " " I 've seen smallpox on the Perdido , John . " " And yet you nursed them ? " " They 'd been left here to die . " " It 's the Indian custom , Faith . " " I  --  did n't touch them , or stay inside the hut . All I did was bring them food and water . " " No one knows of this but Yulee ? " " He 's been in charge of the sentries : they were posted outside that thicket . The others were too busy settling in the lodges to explore this far . " From the darkness outside , John heard Obadiah fetch a deep groan . Both of them had noted how thoroughly the migrants had taken over the village . Some had brought food from the storage houses beside the river ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearths , and the bed skins the Indians had discarded in their headlong departure . All of them had bathed in the pool before the village , and drunk from the spring that gushed from a rocky outcrop near the falls . Whether the pox came from an in/visible miasma or bodily contact , they had blundered into a death trap with no visible exit . " What will we do now , John ? " It was Faith 's voice , raised in a cry of despair . He stepped quickly from the hut and put his arm about her ; it gave him a strange thrill of pride to realize that she had called on him for help at last . " First we must talk with Dr. Wright and Stella . Then we 'll call a council . " " Do you have a plan ? " " A definite plan . If it succeeds , I 've you to thank . " " I do n't understand , John . " He kissed her gently . " If it were n't for you , those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when a live Indian 's worth more than a dead one . " " Do you mean they 're part of your plan ? " " A definite part . But I 'll do my explaining to Dr. Wright , if you do n't mind . " He had made his tone light to reassure her , but he knew that no danger they had faced so far could approach this hideous threat . This was an enemy that could not be conquered with guns ; the weapon he must use was more bizarre than the most ancient amulet in the witch doctor 's hag . Yet nothing else could save them now . Evan Wright and his wife heard John out with only a few whispered interruptions . It was clear that the older doctor had grasped the terrible problem that faced them all . As for Stella , she continued to sit unstirring at her husband 's side . John had no way of translating the meaning of her withdrawal  --  but he suspected that it went far deeper than personal fear.  | " It 's my fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his grisly story . " I insisted that Evan be brought to the village . " " Do n't reproach yourself , " said her husband . " I was as eager to settle here as anyone . " " You were too feverish to think clearly , " said Stella . " The fault was mine . We should have followed John 's orders , and stayed above the falls . " " Does that matter now ? The important thing is to hear his plan  --  if he has one . " " John always has a plan , " said Faith . Like Stella , she had sat quietly  --  in the doorframe of the lodge , with her hands folded on one knee . Somehow , that air of confidence had heartened John for the difficult task he faced . " Let me say this , first of all , " he told them quietly . " If Faith had n't saved those Creeks from starvation , we 'd be really help-less . " " Few of us would have had her courage , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost hope I 've misunderstood your mean-ing . " " You have n't , sir . What I propose is wholesale inoculation of our whole group  --  using the two Creeks as a source for the ma-terial . " " Is such a procedure feasible ? " " When I was a medical student in Edinburgh , it was already widely used in Scotland . I 've a scar on my arm to prove it can succeed . " " Surely it 's too late to be effective here . " " I think not . Smallpox rarely develops less than ten days after exposure . The inoculation practiced by Dr. Dimsdale runs its course in seven days  --  sometimes less . " " Can Dirnsdale account for the difference in time ? " " Not precisely . But it seems evident that the introduction of matter from a smallpox pustule directly into the patient 's skin hastens the development of resist-wee to the disease itself . " John paused as he saw Stella Wright shiver . He had not meantp239to draw so graphic a picture . " Believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added quickly . " There 's usually only local inflammationover that seven-day interval . Sometimes there 's fever  --  but it breaks in a day or so . And when the fever has run its course the patient is well again  --  and immune to the disease thereafter . " " You make it sound simple enough , John , " said Evan Wright . " But there 's tremendous opposition to the Dimsdale method in America . " " Perhaps the doctors here feel it 's still too experimental , " said John . " Or should I say too risky ? " " Does real smallpox ever develop from this inoculation ? " Stella asked . " Cases have been reported , " John admitted . " I 've never witnessedone . " Stella shuddered again , but her chin lifted . " And you feel it 's our only chance , John ? " " Without it , our whole party could be wiped out , save for the few of us who are immune . Those it spared might be too weak to reach civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes moved from face to face in the lodge . " As I said , it 's sheer good fortune that we 've the means at hand , and time on our side . I think we should take the risk . " John 's glance returned anxiously to Evan Wright , who was still lost in thought on his camp bed . " What 's your opinion , sir ? " " I 'm no longer the leader of this party , John . It must be your decision . " " I 'd like your opinion , Doctor . " " It 's a difficult thing to decide . I had a mild case of smallpox as a boy  --  so I wo n't be in personal danger . But I 'd do a great deal to spare Stella . " I 'll take my chance , if it 's what John wants , " said Stella . " Make up your mind to that , Evan . " " I was sure you would , my dear . Give us your orders , John  --  we 'll follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote ? " said Faith suddenly . " We should all have a voice in something so important . " " An excellent idea , " said Evan Wright . " With John 's permission . " John nodded a grateful assent ; the suggestion had lifted a heavy weight from his mind . " Will you call a meeting , sir ? " " Now , or tomorrow ? " " At once . If we decide to carry out inoculation , I propose to complete it tonight . Every hour that we delay is dangerous . " " As you wish , John . " The old doctor raised himself on one elbow to survey the scene before him . " It seems we 've a ready-made council ground  --  and a platform for your speech . " " The people should hear from their real leader , sir , " John said simply . " If you 're well enough to speak , of course . " Evan Wright smiled wanly . " I can always talk , John . Especiallyif I 'm speaking in your behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must take charge . " Supper was over now , and most of the migrants were gossipingabout their new-won firesides . It took no more than a double blast on an empty powder horn to bring them clustering around the chief 's lodge . John put down a deep sense of foreboding as he heard their carefree bursts of laughter , and the easy hum of talk that spelled contentment . Clearly , the camp expected an encouragingreport on his scout downstream  --  perhaps even the news that a flotilla of canoes was on its way to transport them to the sanctuary of Talassee . The cheer that went up when he stepped to the platform ( with Evan Wright leaning on his arm ) did little to raise his spirits . Falling back a pace to permit the older doctor to open the meeting , John fumbled over the words he must force himself to speak . These were frontier folk : all of them had seen the ravages ofp241smallpox in some form . He would need no special eloquence to convince them of their peril . Would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy they might not even understand  --  and would surely suspect ? Clearly , this was the acid test of his leadership . He bowed his head as Evan Wright ( with one hand anchored to the lodge pole ) began to speak in a clear , firm tone . " My friends and neighbors , " said the old doctor , we have called you together tonight to discuss a grave threat that confronts us all --  " The cough that shook Evan Wright 's slender frame was in no sense a rhetorical pause , though it served the same purpose . The blank silence that clamped down on the council ground was followed by a rising murmur ; Dr. Wright stilled it with a peremptory spread of his hands , as he seemed to lift himself from that spasm of pain by will power alone . " Dr. Powers is ready to describe that threat  --  and the means we have chosen to combat it , It rests with you to endorse or reject that choice . I will say that I accept his proposal wholeheartedly . We 've no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the camp chair that Stella had brought from the house . John found himself meeting familiar eyes as he moved to the front of the platform . But they were happy no longer : the faces lifted to catch his first words were blank with dread . Yet he could sense that the crowd was on his side ; thanks to past performance , it might well continue to follow his lead . But if he dared presume on that blind urge to obedience , he must be sure of the rightness of what he proposed . " I 've no speech to make tonight , " he said  --  and dropped to one knee , that he might be nearer that intent circle . " With your permission , I 'll speak to you as a doctor . " No one stirred while he described his discoveries downriver . When he had told of the ghastly presences in the sick-house , a woman 's voice lifted from the silence in a thin and piercing wail.  | " My father died of the pox  --  and my two brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It will kill just as fast on the trail , " said John , in a shout that topped hysteria in the making . " I tell you there 's a chance , if we keep our heads . Will you trust me to do what I can to stop an epidemic ? " The offer quieted the wailing for a moment . Ned Beasley ( his broken ankle propped on a crutch ) hobbled forward to lift his voice . " Give us Beasleys our orders , Doc . You saved my life once ; I reckon you 'll save it again . My family will do what you say . " " And mine , " shouted Colonel Larkin . A dozen others took up the chant , until John was forced to shout for quiet . Warming though the response had been , he realized that he must spell out the peril . " This is a drastic remedy for a drastic situation . How many of you have had smallpox ? " Seven hands in all went up around the circle . " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assume you 're protected . The disease rarely strikes twice . Has anyone here been inoculated ? " No one spoke for an instant : John could see that the word itself was strange to his listeners . Then , to his relief , a small , broadshoulderedScot came forward , fingers hooked in belt , to stare up at the platform with a certain defiance . " Is that where they make a little slit in your hide and rub in pus ? " " That 's the treatment . Have you taken it ? " " Ten years ago , Doc , in Glasgow . " " Can you remember what happened ? " " Felt a mite anguished for a few days . My arm was sore where they cut me , but that was all . And I never took the pox . " " You 've heard what Will Cronin said . " Again , John raised his voice to still a rising babble . " Inoculation caused him no harm  --  and he 's been immune ever since . It 's my plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the war of tongues seemed to cut in many directions . It was Beasley 's turn to still the murmur as he hobbled up to stand below the platform . " Do n't want to sound gloomy , Doc . But you said this business was drastic . Can you tell us more about it ? " " I did n't mean it 's painful or dangerous . Sometimes , 1 ' 11 grant you , the treatment brings on real smallpox . But such cases are rare . " He was glad he had put the threat into words before it occurred to someone in the crowd to raise the query . Now that he held their attention , he felt he should complete the pattern quickly . " Will Cronin has already described the inoculation , " he said . " If you 're still willing , I intend to scratch every arm in this camp , and rub the matter from an active smallpox sore into the cut --  " " From the Indians in the sick-house ? " It was Colonel Larkin who bayed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exudate from a living victim must be used . " " Will that make me part Creek ? " The whoop of laughter that rose from the council ground told John the worst of his trial was over . " Many of us are already blood brother with some friendly Indian , " he said . " Why should n't they help us tonight ? " " D' you guarantee this cure , Doc ? " asked Beasley . " That 's something no doctor can do as yet , " John admitted . " You see , Ned , it 's more protection than cure . I wo n't deny that there are risks involved , but it 's our only way out tonight . " He had al ready shucked his jacket , making it a simple matter to bare his left arm to the shoulder . " As you can see , I took the inoculation myself , years ago . Here 's the scar . I was none the worse for it  --  and I 'm safe from smallpox now . " The sharp intake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display had brought his point home : if the medicine had saved the physician , how could it fail the patient ? John pressed his advantage swiftly . " I can begin these treat/ments in a few minutes , " he said . " I wo n't stress the importance of time . Nor will I remind you that we must rest here until we 're sure our remedy is successful . Once you 've submitted to inoculation , this village becomes a hospital . Obadiah and I will help nurse if we 're needed ; Dr. Wright will assist us later . Others who are immune will serve as hunters and cooks . Is that agreeable ? " " You 're still the doctor , " said a voice , far back in the crowd . This time , the cheer that followed was convincing enough . John lifted his voice above it . " We 've not put this to a vote  --  but we will , if anyone wishes . " When no such proposal was made , he looked out across the wide circle of faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll proceedat once , then . Yulee will bring torches to this platform , and a worktable . You can form in line , and file past me , one by one . I 'll go now and prepare . " He jumped down from the platform , sensing the hesitation even before his feet touched the ground . It had been easy enough for the crowd to endorse his medical opinion . It was another matter to form in single file , for a treatment that might endanger all their lives . He started to speak again , but realized that no words from him could break this natural inertia , now that he stood eye to eye with his patients . Then , as he hesitated in turn , a voice rose out of the silence to wipe the last doubt away . " I 'll be the first , John . " Without turning to look , he knew that Faith had spoken . He stood aside to let Faith take her place beside the ladder , and watched her bare her left arm to the shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women moved forward to line up behind her , or turned to the lodges to rout out their offspring . John made no attempt to thank Faith as he movedp245on , though his eyes spoke his gratitude feelingly enough . Some how it was fitting that she should have been the first to step fur ward ; he had expected it from the start . At the lazarette , he found Obadiah ( a vinegar-soaked rug pressed to his nostrils ) fanning the two sweating patients on the trestle bed . With the aid of the torches , John allowed himself time for a thorough examination , which convinced him that both Indians , despite their advanced years , had broken through the crisis of the illness . Though their bodies would be pitted with a thousand crater scars to remind them of their ordeal , there was a better than even chance that they would rise from this bed again . This , too , seemed a fitting aftermath , in view of the help he would ask from them now . " It 's in the declining phase , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell me here awhile longer ? " " I 'll be honest , Doc , " said the Kentuckian . " Squaws have nursed me through breakbone fever on the Ohio : I reckon this is only turnabout . " Obadiah listened with sagging jaw , as John outlined the procedurehe intended to follow . He was still staring when John bent above the shoulder of a comatose ancient , lifted the depressed crust from the largest crater he could find , and scooped out the whitish material beneath . A half-teaspoon of this noxious exudate , collected in a pannikin , was more than sufficient ; he took a trifle more , if only to dumbfound the Kentuckian further . " Speaking of medicine gourds and shamans , Doc --  " " The first rule of nursing , " said John , " is to hold one 's tongue while the doctor 's working . Call me at once if they look worse . I 've a busy night ahead . " Returning to the council ground with his precious toxin , john rehearsed his textbook memory of the Dimsdale method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare his ( patients carefully . Nine days of fasting usually preceded inoculations ; the formidable medicines administered during this time included a concoction of calomel , tartar emetic , and ground crabs ' claws ,  |p246which  was followed by a titanic dosage of Glauber 's salt . John had often wondered if such progressive weakening of the system was advisable . As a military surgeon , he had observed that such standardremedies as bloodletting and massive purgation could both kill and cure . Obviously , no such regimen could be followed here . Returning to the chief 's hut , he observed that Yulee had already set up a table on the platform and opened his medical bag . He selected two scalpels and brought forth a bottle of brandy as well , in case of fainting fits . Massed torches in the wall brackets behind him threw the scene into strong relief . I3e was aware of Evan Wright , sitting bolt upright on his pallet , of Stella 's anxious eyes as she hovered at her husband 's side  --  but there was no time for further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he summoned Faith to the platform . She joined him without a word , and laid her bare arm across the table . With a knife balanced in his palm , he stared down at her warm brown skin , and felt a great reluctance to mar it , howeverslightly . " Do n't be afraid , John , " she whispered . " I 'm not . " It was all he needed to break the inertia. ' he scalpel moved as fluently as though the steel were controlled by a force outside himself . He watched the point prick Faith 's skin , so delicately that it showed only a thread of blood at the depths of the tiny wound . A second cut was repeated , a few inches above the first : the fingers of his left hand tensed the skin between , so the two small incisions opened wide . Using the second scalpel , he lifted a droplet of the whitish exudate and touched it to each wound , turning the blade slightly to press the toxic liquid into the tissue . Thanks to the skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds . Faith , smiling down at the waiting line below , announced that it had been quite painless . " Does it need a dressing ? " she asked . " The incisions can remain exposed . Just be careful not to rub or wash them right away . "  |p247He  let Faith step back , now that their instant of personal contacthad passed . For the next two hours , he was far too busy to ponder on risks . Now that she had helped him over that first flash of indecision , he was only a hard-working doctor , absorbed in the task at hand . The migrants shuffled past his table in seemingly endless line . Though he read terror in many eyes , there was no real hesitation  --  save when the inevitable fainting occurred at the sight of blood . As always ( John noted , with a certain grim humor ) , it was the most stalwart males among his patients who collapsed under the flick of the knife . The women in the cavalcade accepted their inoculations with an almost stoical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimpers , turned out to be good soldiers . Stella was the last to bare her arm for the knife . He looked at her out of weary eyes as he rubbed the whitish exudate into her skin . She had winced under the scalpel . Now her lips drew down in another grimace that had no relation to that all but imaginary stab of pain . " At least I 'm glad you and Evan will be spared , " she whispered . " What are you saying ? " " I feel this was my fault , John . You might call it a judgment of God . " He put away his scalpels , conscious of the fact that they stood alone on the platform . He had known that his patients would hasten to their lodges , where they would lie in the dark through a sleepless night , waiting for symptoms that could never develop in so short a time span . On his couch behind the open doorway of the hut , Dr. Wright had dropped into slumber , wearied by the tensions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own concentration , John studied Stella with real concern . " Call it a mistake , if you insist , " , he said . " You must n't blame yourself . " " Walk with me to the falls , " she whispered . " Tell me I do n't deserve to die . "  |p248The  council ground was deserted when they stepped down from the platform ; the lodges that ringed it seemed empty as the day he had gone downriver with Obadiah . Save for the sleepy cry of a child , and the glowing embers of a few cook fires , there was no hint of human tenancy . Death might have put his seal on each doorsill , before moving on to other matters . At the river 's edge , they paused with fingers laced and stared upstream at the misting of the falls . The mutter of the cascade seemed an ideal obbligato for the moment . " I need your help tonight , John , " she said . " For a week now , I 've been struggling with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the Tombigbee ? " " Since the Tombigbee . " " We could n't help wanting each other that afternoon . " " It was more than wanting , John . So much more . That afternoon in your arms -- I was completely happy , for the first time . " " So was I , Stella . " " Perhaps it 's wrong , to steal that kind of happiness , " she said . " This may be God 's way of reminding me . " " Not even an Old Testament Jehovah would take a hundred lives for what we 've done , " he told her quietly . When she spoke again , her voice was so low he could barely hear it above the pulsing beat of the waterfall . " Do n't you see , John ? I 'm the only one who should die . It would be my atone-ment . " " Atonement ? For a sin you did n't commit ? " " I tried to give myself to you , " she whispered . " Can you deny it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weeping quietly now , but her voice had steadied a little . " We ca n't go on this way , John  --  half in love , not daring to he alone together for a moment . And yet I know I would n't send you away at Talassee ; I could n't face the thought of losing you entirely . WouId n't it be simpler if I was the one to go ? To leave both you and Evan --  ? "  |p249He  could tell that she was near hysteria ; the pressure of desire joined to the long anxieties of the trail , had simply burst all bonds . It was quite like Stella Wright to insist that she , and she alone . must shoulder a burden of guilt too great for one mortal to bear . It was even more in character that she should face this motional impasse clearly . Hypocrisy was not among this warmhearted woman 's vices . Here in the wilderness , at long last , she too had matured  --  enough to give her passion its right name . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it --  " " Tell me what to do , John , " she said . " I 'll try to follow orders . " " You must live for his sake  --  as well as mine . " " That 's how I 'd planned it . I meant to bring Evan safely to East Florida . I hoped you 'd wait there for me  --  until he died . After what happened on the Tombigbee , I 'm afraid we could n't wait at all --  " Her voice was trailing into hysteria again , but she controlledit with an effort . " Unless you could be strong for us both  --  as you were that afternoon --  " " I can try , Stella . " " Suppose you 're right  --  about this inoculation ? Suppose we 're all spared , and reach Talassee . Will you promise to be wise ? Enough to save all of us  --  from too much unhappiness ? " " I 'll do my best , Stella . " " That 's enough for now , " she said . " You keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 'll keep this one , " she said . " I 'll go back to Evan now . You need n't be afraid , John . I wo n't behave badly again . " If Stella had placed her future in his care that night beside the falls , he soon realized that the whole cavalcade had done likewise . The fact that they had accepted his judgment in the matter of the inoculation was a measure of their trust . In the twop250weeks that followed , their eagerness to believe in his therapy was , at times , a little frightening . At the end of that first week ( or , at the outside , ten days ) he had hoped for the classic aftermath  --  in effect , a mild case of the disease , with fever and a rash , but few if any pustules or scars . This was the usual sequence , when inoculation was a complete success . Almost invariably , the patient recovered quickly , with none of the severe symptoms that would occur with smallpox itself . It was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild attack seemed to confer upon the sufferer a degree of resistanceto the disease itself sufficient to offer permanent protection . To John 's surprise and dismay , however , his cases did not followthis pattern . By the third day , he could see that nearly all of them were developing a definite pustule at one or both of the spots where he had scratched their arms . Each day thereafter , these spots grew larger and more virulent  --  though there was , as yet , no sign of rash elsewhere , and little if any fever . As for the two Indians in the lazarette , their recovery was little short of amazing . Faith had insisted on doing her share of nursing , and John had yielded to her pleas after a prolonged argument : he was sure that her care , and the nourishing broths she provided , speeded their convalescence . At the week 's end , both ancients were as good as well , though their bodies were hideously pitted . It hardly surprised him when they slipped into the forest  --  taking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filched from one of the lodges . He was sure they would join their people in time , to boast of the white man 's cure . A story of this sort , howevergarbled , would stand him in good stead later . On the eighth day , the casebook recorded fever cases by the dozens  --  enough to keep John furiously busy in an effort to reduce the discomfort of patients of all ages . A precise diagnosis was of course impossible under these conditions . He could not even be sure if the fevers sprang from an entirely different cause  --  or if they were , indeed , an overture to a genuine case of smallpox , inducedp251by the inoculation itself . As he brooded on these imponderables , he was glad that the two Creeks had taken themselves elsewhere . Their gaunt , near-naked frames , deep-pitted as some lunar landscape , had been a hideous reminder of what might happen to the others if his gamble failed  --  and to Faith in particular . Faith , he discovered , exemplified the direction of this strange course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her arm were larger , the inflammation that ringed them more pronounced . So far , she had failed to develop a fever  --  and he could only pray that his suspicions would prove unjustified . He could not yet know if he had erred in permitting her to continuenursing , when she was herself a walking reservoir of the very disease she had defeated in the lazarette . On the ninth night , he remained with the worst of his patients until dawn , dosing them with Peruvian bark and waiting fearfully for the first telltale eruption that would spell out an answer to his doubts . The sun had already risen above the live oaks on the bank when he stumbled to his own lodge . Faith was tossing restlessly in her sleep , and he felt sure that she murmured his name as he parted the grass matting across the door . The pustule around each of the two wounds , he noted , was now larger than a good-sized pea . The adjacent skin was a deep , taut red for a circular area of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole upperarm . He touched her forehead gently , finding it hot and dry with fever . When he took his hand away , he saw that her eyes were open . Her lips shaped his name , but she did not smile . " Did you have a good night , my dear ? " " I think so , John . But I have a headache  --  and I feel a hit chilly --  " Her tone was strangely light , the words slurred . John pretended to sort the contents of his medical kit , so that she would not see the fear in his eyes . " So you 've caught up with the others at last , " he said . " I 've been hoping for that . "  | " What does it mean ? That I 'll be feverish later ? " " Yes , Faith . It 's what we 've been waiting for . " " Could n't it also mean I 'm getting smallpox ? " He forced himself to look into her face as he spoke : lies would be wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are others in camp with fever . And there 's been no eruption so far , beyond the point of entry . " " How is Stella ? " The abruptness of the query startled him . " Stella 's fever broke yesterday , " he said . " She 's up and around again . So are more than half the others . " " Then the treatment was a success , John . " " Not until you 're well too . " " No doctor can win every case . You must n't be too downcast if you 've guessed wrong with me . " " You 're going to get well , " he said . " I 'll see to that . " " Will it matter too much if I do n't ? You can still take these people to Talassee . Eventually , I suppose , you can marry Stella  --  if marriage is what she wants from you now . " He stared at her without speaking . There had been no accusationin her tone , and no hint of tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . He felt that he could do no less than match her honesty , however he might bungle the effort . " You asked me that same question in Natchez  --  remember ? " " Can you answer it today ? " Her voice was still dead calm , for all the lightness of her tongue . Knowing the depths of her feeling , he could draw but one conclusion . Faith Gordon was facing death this morning  --  and settling her account with life , while she held the adversary at bay . " She wants me to go on to East Florida , " he said . " To set up a practice there with Dr. Wright --  " " Will you go with them ? " " Would you hate me , if I did ? " " I 've no right to hate you , John  --  when you 've done so much for me. "  | " You must hate me a little , " he said . " How can you help yourself ? It 's thanks to me you 're here . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind that now , " she whispered . " It was a  --  labor of love . " He sensed that her mind had already begun to spin down the long vortex to delirium . Taking her in his arms , rocking her there as he might rock a child , he knew there was little he could say to comfort her , though he made the effort . " Do you think I 'd let you die  --  after what you 've done for me ? " " Some of us must die  --  on every journey . " Her whisper was so faint he could hardly catch the words . " Not on this one , Faith . We 've a special providence that decrees otherwise . " " Do n't ask too much of providence , John . It is n't fair . " She seemed to be reasoning aloud now , as though she were only half conscious of his presence . " Some of us must die  --  that others may live . That 's my last lesson . I ca n't teach you another --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death as an escape from a dilemma she was powerless to solve . Faith , like a true philosopher , was accepting the fact of death , as the end product of all men 's strivings . Not that she welcomed it ; she would fight that ancient enemy to her last anguished breath . It was her resignation that moved him most of all . She would go beyond the brink -- if she were indeed fated to make that journey  --  as bravely as she had lived . You 're much too young to talk of death , " he said . " I 'll pull you through this business . Rely on that . " " Perhaps you will . " Her eyes could tease him even now , clouded though they were with fever . " You 've always had your way . " " Promise you wo n't stop fighting . This fever may be worse beforeits better . " " I want to live , John . Have I ever stopped fighting  --  for what I want ? " " We 're both in this battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose it . We 've come too far together . "  | " Much too far , " she said drowsily . " Even if I had no right to intrudeon the journey . " Her voice trailed off on that , though she cried out now and again , from the fog in which her mind wandered . All that morning , while she slept , he remained at her side  --  though he knew he was urgently needed elsewhere . She had saved his life more than once . Her resourcefulness and her example had kept these migrantson the trail . Had he repaid her devotion to them all by dooming her to extinction  --  or , perhaps , to a mutilation worse than death itself ? All through that day , and the one that followed , he carried that agonizing question in his mind , without daring to frame an answer . When twelve full days had passed since the fugitives ' first exposure to smallpox , he risked recording his first faint hope of success in his casebook . Elsewhere in camp , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of rash , save at the point of inoculation . On the dawn of the thirteenth day , Faith gave a great cry in her sleep , and half started from her brushwood bed . He took her in his arms to restrain her  --  and tears of joy blurred his eyes when he found that her body , like the others ' , was bathed in sweat . The worst of her delirium , he knew now , was behind her . Fourteen days from the first exposure , he told himself with a kind of fierce pride , was the maximum for the development of smallpox . On the fourteenth morning , he noted that the pustules on his patients ' arms , without exception , had begun to shrivel away . Fever was nonexistent in every lodge , and there was still no trace of rash . True , the whole cycle of preventive treatment had been unusual . But he was sure that his hundred-odd charges were out of danger . Faith , who had suffered the most violent reaction , smiled up at him faintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , blessedly unmarked body in a fresh blanket , and poured out her medicine.  | " Sleep , my dear , " he advised her . " Sleep the clock around , if you can . I 've given you a double potion of laudanum . " " I  --  almost disgraced you , did n't I , John ? " " You could n't if you tried . " " Suppose I 'd died  --  and spoiled your record ? " " Do n't mention that word again . " " Was I terribly sick ? " " You had a high fever . But it 's gone now . " " I wo n't get smallpox ? " He laughed aloud , for the first time in weeks . " No , Faith . That 's one thing we can be sure of . " Her hand closed on his , and her eyes searched his face anxiously . " Tell me one thing more . Was I  --  out of my head ? " " For a day or so . " " I ca n't remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He kissed her eyelids shut without speaking ; though her head seemed clear enough today , she was not quite in command of her tongue . Still , he could understand this urge to think aloud , now that the dread weight of her sickness had lifted . " Of course you 'll never tell me , " she said . " A doctor must have some secrets from his patient . " " I 'll be honest , " he told her . " You talked a great deal  --  but I could n't understand a word . " As white lies go , he thought , yours has a large grain of truth . The Faith who had bowed her head to death , however briefly , was not the Faith he knew . That Faith would never surrender him willingly to Stella Wright  --  even on the edge of doom  |p259Though  he was positive his ex-patients were sound enough to travel , John held the cavalcade two precautionary days beside ' lie Tascaloosa , while stores were replenished . It proved lucky halt . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an eight-mule pack train and a store of gossip from the Creeks ' Upper Towns . The story Jeff Cowert told was vastly reassuring . There had been no smallpox along the higher reaches of the stream -- and though Jeff himself was an avowed Whig , the Indians had been receptive enough . Rumors were afoot among the Creeks that the war on the Atlantic seaboard would soon be ending and they had been eager for the trader 's report . The only real hostility he had encountered had come from certain sachems who suspected hint to be an advance scout for invasion . " You folks are safe here , if you 're really King 's men , " Covert assured them . " Specially if the doe 's a friend of McGillivray 's . " " Any idea of Colonel McGillivray 's whereabouts at the moment ? " asked John . " He 's generally at the Long House in Talassee until harvest time , " said Cowert . " And Talassee 's only a few miles Iron ) the Hickory Ground . If you want my advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask his help . " " Would you care to guide us ? " So far , the talk with Cowert had been conducted at the river 's edge , with Obadiah the only listener . I ) r . Wright had been restingat the chief 's hut , and John had his own reasons for keepingp260this part of their conversation secret . The trader 's news about the war might be only unfounded rumor : he had no desire to depress the old doctor needlessly . " You wo n't need a guide , Doc , " said Cowert . " Once you clear the valley on the Tascaloosa , the Indian trail 's plain as a road . You 'll cross two little rivers , the Cabo and the Ampohla , but they 'll make no trouble for you . With any push at all , you should be at the Koosah in ten days ' time . " " We 'd make it even sooner , with those pack mules , " said Obadiah . " What 's your idea of a fair price ? " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it developed that the peddler was glad to part with his mules for a reasonable sum  --  along with what trade goods remained in his packs . Convincedthat the war 's end was imminent , he intended to strike south to Mobile , to be on time for the jubilation . At John 's request , he had kept these reasons to himself when he was presented to Evan Wright , and the agreed-on sum paid out of the doctor 's saddlebags . Even if Cowert 's beliefs were verified , there would still be a water route open to East Florida and St. Augustine  --  and an asylum of sorts for the Wrights , during the inevitablepourparlers abroad that must precede a formal peace . These rumors from the outside world ( to which the cavalcade had so long remained strangers ) seemed unimportant indeed when measured against the fact that they could finish their march to Talassee without hardship . Thanks to Cowert 's mules , it was now possible to relieve some fifty human porters of the load of pelts they had transported intactfrom Natchez . The packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part , with a few packs of salt and a jug or two of mountain whiskey ) were taken as added insurance , if the migrants should need proof of good intentions before reaching McGillivray . Their rest beside the falls , the medical legerdemain that had preserved them from the scourge of smallpox , and this final stroke of good fortune were enough to send the fugitives on trail againp261in the best of spirits . Heading the marchers one more time , watching the cavalcade fall into position like a seasoned army that has survived most hazards of the field , John could cross his fingers in silent hope . Luck ( or was it the grace of the Almighty ? ) had brought them this far , without a single grave to mark their progress . Now that a hard-packed trail had opened beside the riverbank , now that they had food and mounts in plenty , it seemed that they would finish this wilderness march precisely as they had planned . Yet John did not unlatch his fingers until the last migrant had quitted the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard until he stood in the Long House at Talassee , face to face with the king of the Creeks . Jeff Cowert had given them precise directions to the Hickory Ground , along with the opinion that they would arrive there at the time of the late summer powwow . As john had hoped , the Romans map he had used ( which had proved so accurate duringtheir long pilgrimage ) confirmed the trader 's estimates , almost to the mile . Nine days after they left the village , they stood on the banks of the Koosah  --  or the Alabahma , as it was also called on the chart  --  secure in the knowledge that the great council ground of the nation was only a short march to the northeast . Another day was needed to build rafts to ferry the cavalcade across the Koosah . This time , the crossing was made without mishap ; the river was broad and placid at this point , with gentle banks ; the meadow on its eastern shore proved an adequate campsite . John ordered the tents raised at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accurate , and the Indians were assembled in force , he had no intention of bringing a hundredwhite marchers to the Hickory Ground without warning.
