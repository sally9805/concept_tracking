Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> After 73 days of marriage but little bliss , Five &; Dime Store Heiress Barbara Hutton and Dominican Playboy-Diplomat Porfirio Rubirosa " mutually decided that it is wisest for us to separate . " The honeymoon had been a mishmash of thrills ( Rubi finished second in the Sebring twelve-hour sports-car endurance race ) , spills ( Babs broke an ankle in her Manhattan bathroom ) , and finally chills ( Babs left Rubirosa in their Palm Beach mansion last week and moved in with her aunt ) . For all of Porfirio 's junior standing ( he has racked up four marriages to Barbara 's five ) , the round was clearly his . Although he renounced all claims to share Babs 's money , he collected a handsome dowry while the getting was good . Reported items : a $200,000 airplane , a string of blue-blooded polo ponies , $800,000 worth of other knickknacks . <P> In Manhattan , Author Marion ( See Here , Private Hargrove ) Hargrove , 34 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 ( after three children ) , announced that this week he will marry Robin Edwards Roosevelt , 25 , who got a Juarez divorce ( after one child ) last week from F.D.R. 's onetime favorite White House romper and grandson , Curtis ( " Buzzie " Dall ) Roosevelt. * <P> Cinemactor Lex ( Tarzan ) Barker , 34 , confided to a reporter how his marriage to Cinemactress Lana Turner , 34 , has converted them both into plain old homebodies : " We just have dinner at home , and never go any place . She owes me a fortune in gin rummy . " Lana , said Lex , lets him hang his trophies on the wall . " Some women might stick up their noses at my African shields and my helmets and swords , but Lana 's cute about it . She tries on the helmets . " <P> Nervously pulling at his pipe , the Duke of Windsor fidgeted on the first tee of a Cuban golf course , was photographed just before he smacked out a drive in the opening round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Country Club . <P> Greek-born Shipping Tycoon Aristotle Socrates Onassis , 48 , who is under indictment on a charge of conspiring to gyp the U.S. in some postwar deals to buy surplus ships ( TIME , Feb. 15 ) , waited for delivery of one of the fanciest yachts to sail since Financier J. P. Morgan 's Corsair churned the seagoing carriage-trade routes . In the North German port of Kiel , a 325-ft. frigate is being converted into the Christina , a floating pleasure dome which will be the flagship of Onassis ' cargo and tanker fleet . Trimmed in marble , mosaics and lapis lazuli ( cost : $3.50 per square inch ) , the yacht will have a top speed of 18 knots , will tote- among other frills-a doctor 's operating room , sailboat , speedboat and amphibian airplane . When he has nothing else to do ( such as dropping in at Monte Carlo 's famed Casino , which he owns , crap tables and all ) , Onassis will rough it on the Christina and use her for an office .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
