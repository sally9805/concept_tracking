txt Letters to The Times Mastering Geography Grasp of Facts Deemed Essential for Understanding World Affairs To THE EDITOR OP THE NEW YORK TIME You have rendered a great public service in presenting the results of the " Geography Survey " prepared by Dr. Samuel Van Valkenburg . While we suspect that these results will shock many of your readers , they come as no surprise to those of us who are , or have been , teachers of the subject . You can not eliminate geography from the high school curriculum for thirty years without producing a generation of geographical illiterates . Of course there are some who would argue that it does ncii much matter whether or not a student knows the population of the United States to the nearest hundred million , that atlases exist for the purpose of relieving a man of the responsibility of carrying a visual picture of Yugoslavia in his head ; that good citizenship does not need to be predicated upon sound knowledge of time zones and great circle routes ; that these and all other specialized pieces of geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pass their days on Capitol Hill and in the federal departments . But is there any assurance that the " experts " are always so much better informed than the college student , or the laity in general ? Some time ago the word " Azerbaijan " was shown to 500 people in Washington : 484 declared they had never seen it before , sixteen gave partially correct but vague answers , and not one gave a completely correct answer  --  and this notwithstanding the fact that in 1945 we narrowly missed being plunged into a third world war over a clash of AngloAmerican and Russian policies in Azerbaijan . Political Significance If ignorance of mere place names is so widespread , then it is obvious that ignorance of the political , economic and strategic significance of such places , and the merits of conflicting claims to their resources , must be almost universal . At times we are sorely tempted to wonder how much the members of our Legislatures and the men who formulate our foreign policy and international trade agreements know f about the dozens of places all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be jeopardized  --  even lost ? by reason of irrational behavior springing from such ignorance . Fortunately , in the Azerbaijan instance our ignorance did not prove expensive . But it may not always be so . The British were not so lucky with their peanut scheme in Tanganyika which has already cost ? 36,000,000 and will cost many more before the British housewife derives an ounce of margarine from the undertaking . And why ? Because the scheme was utopian ? Poorly administered ? Inadequately staffed ? By no means . The real trouble is that not enough was known about the character of the terrain to be cultivated , the vagaries of the climate , the constitution of the soil , the moisture requirements of the crop or even the working habits of the local African tribes . In a word , not enough was known of its essential geography . And what of this country ? There are many geographers who would contend that the same criticisms could be leveled against some of the spectacular social engineering projects to which we have committed ourselves both at home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be that as it may , we can not escape the fact that wherever we turn today we are faced with problems involving the unequal distribution of man , space and resources  --  problems that have their roots in the earth and man 's use or abuse of it , and can only be solved by men and women who have learned how to assess the importance of those facts of environment that are operative in human affairs and are then prepared to use the knowledge acquired by their studies . To Acquire Knowledge Such knowledge , however , is hardly won , It is not to be had by an overnight stay in a foreign capital , or by an exchange of letters , or the reading of official releases , let alone the occasional viewing of colored travelogues . It is only to be attained by a longcontinued educational program , wisely administered and supported by all the agencies of popular communication currently at our command . Here , surely , is a task that needs to be embarked upon without delay and for no less a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . It is also a task that the American Geographical Society , with its century-old reputation for disinterested research along the frontiers of geography , has deeply at heart and upon which it has now set its sights . GEORGE H. T. KIMBLE , Director , American Geographical Society . New York , June 12 , 1951 . Dealing With the Narcotics Problem To THE EDITOR OP THE New YORK TIMES : There may be a considerable discrepancy among the various journalistic reports on the extent of juvenile narcotic addiction and those reports which emanate from official sources ; the unalterable fact remains that this menace lurks unabated in the midst of our community and that only an aroused public opinion may check it . No one will deny that the correct and ultimate solution to this problem lies in the removal of the causes which , in the large measure , predispose to the spread of the vice , such as overcrowded alums , lack of playgrounds and other sociological delinquencies . This , however , would be taking a long view of a serious emergency which demands irp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the crime of the narcoosid ring which smuggles the drugs into this country and initiates their circulation a ghastly felony . Denial of bail and the threat of life imprisonment may have the desired sobering effect upon those who direct the narcotic traffic . There are *vital and official agencies whose work in combating the nal% cotio evil deserves public praise . I wonder if these agencies ever contemplated the medium of colored picture posters to state their case ? The subject is so replete with human misery , that the pictorial approach to the ! masts , ination of the youngster as yet une touched by the drug habit can be dramatized more profoundly than by public lecture or individual instruction ; Picture posters warning the teen-ago children to keep out of the reach of the villainous dope peddler , depicting the inevitable disaster resulting from a drug habit , with captions and legends printed in several languages and posted wherever children congregate , will , in my opinion , go a long way to bring the grim realities to the mind of the youngster . RALPH L. DOURMASHKIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suspension of Party Lines Less Emotion and Politics Advocated for Good of Country TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEN11 The attitude of some Congressmen regarding the current investigation of the Administration 's global and Far Eastern policies is most interesting indeed . I suspect that voters who do not cast ballots according to party lines are ins dined to believe that not a few of the lawmakers are men of closed minds . Those representatives who do not wish to be convinced seem determined not to be convinced regardless of the testimony . The political lines that were drawn before the start of the investigation appear to be as secure as ever. , It is easy to appreciate the ovcrwhelming desire of the opposition party to assume control of the Government . But it is to he fervently hoped that the Republican members of Congress will ever put the good of the country and its people as a whole in the forefront of their thinking . Could it be that some of our Representatives and Senators do not feel the sense of responsibility commensurate with their positions as members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder to these men is quite in order . Democrats and Republicans alike are in the service of the nation just as arm the men in Korea , Europe and elsewhere . Any policy instituted and cars Tied out in the interest of the American people deserves the full understanding and backing of all our elected representatives . A policy initiated and executed by the Administration is not necessarily unwise because it meets with opposition . In disapproving a Government policy an intelligent opposition must have a concrete plan to offer in its stead .. Otherwise we have opposition for the sake of opposition  --  a situation which can lead to little if any good . A dispassionate approach to the problems before the nation is a much needed requisite . Less emotion and party politics need to be supplanted with a healthy application of good old American common sense . Confidence in the Republican members of the Congress is just as important and necessary as confidence in the Democratic members . Much of the uninspirational political maneuverings we have witnessed of late is hardly conducive to either trust or respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Forest Hills , N. Y. , June 7 , 1951 , Dangers for Pedestrians To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW Yoluc Tams : A recent letter in THE TIMES calls attention to traffic dangers in Columbus Circle . Another place where people can be killed or seriously injured under present conditions is at the intersection of Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue at Seventy-second Street . People coming out of the subway station who want to reach the northeast corner of Broadway take %pat seems at first glance the one and only way to do this . But without knowing it , they are crossing diagonally . Because the subway structure shuts out the view , they can not see the cars which have the green light going north . The proper way to cross is to do the thing in two steps instead of using the diagonal . A simple way to prevent the harm would be to paint arrows on the pavement pointing out the proper method .
