The taxpayers got a look last week at the gigantic new wind tunnel ( cost : $33 million ) at the propulsion laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at Cleveland . It has been abuilding since 1952 , and so far as the Western world knows , it is the most powerful in operation . Engines up to 5 ft. in diameter can be tested in its 10 ft. - by- 10 ft. throat , fed with air rushing past at Mach 3.5 ( 1,800 m.p.h . ) . To move so much air at this speed requires monstrous fans that soak up 250,000 h.p . <P> When a passive model is being tested , the air in the tunnel is sent around a circuit and used repeatedly , but jet engines or ram-jets poison the air with their exhaust gases . New air must be taken from the atmosphere , and its excess moisture eliminated . So the tunnel is provided with a monstrous air dryer stocked with 1,890 tons of activated alumina , which soaks up 1.5 tons ( ten bathtubs ) of water per minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried out after two hours , and this takes enough gas burners to keep the whole city of Berea , Ohio ( pop . 13,200 ) warm in winter . The air in the tunnel must be cooled , and the job is done by cooling apparatus equivalent to 250,000 household air conditioners . <P> An important part of the new tunnel is an automatic system for making sense out of the flood of information that streams from it . Eighty thousand separate measurements may be made in a single day . The figures are first put on magnetic tape , then worked over by an electronic computer that reduces them quickly to curves and tables . In old-style wind-tunnel setups , most of this job was done by hand and often took several weeks . <P> Many a Clevelander was apprehensive while the new tunnel was under construction . Lesser tunnels at the same site jangled nerves with their dreadful racket . This tunnel has an enormous muffler in which even the loudest sounds get lost . A screaming siren can be carried into the muffler and become inaudible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its noise is reduced to levels acceptable at least to N.A.C.A. 's hardened neighbors . The tunnel works-late at night only , so its inordinate thirst for electricity will not slow the city of Cleveland ( pop . 935,000 ) .
