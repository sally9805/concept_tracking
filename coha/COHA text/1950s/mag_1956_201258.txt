BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY ( 243 pp. ) - Mark Harris-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> It was Ring Lardner who made the first serious attempt in fiction to find out if baseball players are people . His answer in the You Know Me , Al stories could be boiled down to yes , with reservations . Now , 40 years later , both sportswriters and novelists seem to have fewer reservations . In Bernard Malamud 's The Natural ( TIME , Sept. 8 , 1952 ) , there was the mystical intimation that major-leaguers might even have souls . In Bang the Drum Slowly , Novelist Mark ( The Southpaw ) Harris modestly stays closer to the bag . Look , he says , they are human , and their hearts can hurt as much as a spiked foot . <P> The man whose plight uncovers compassion in Bang the Drum Slowly is Catcher Bruce Pearson . He is a baseball and football tramp . His near illiteracy was no handicap at a Southern university , but with the Mammoths , one of the New York big league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive handicap to the pitcher , endowed only with a real passion for pasting the ball . Next to visiting prostitutes , Bruce 's favorite off-diamond pastime is sitting at hotel windows and spitting into the street . What fascinates Bruce is the fact that , when spitting from on high , he can put a curve on it . <P> Bruce is more victim than hero , the means whereby Pitcher Henry Wiggen , the narrator of Bang , can make his point that ballplayers belong to the fraternity of men . Bruce has Hodgkin 's disease , and any moment may be his last . That is why Ace Pitcher Wiggen makes it part of his contract that Bruce must be kept on with the Mammoths as long as he is . That is why the players who had got their kicks out of riding the dumb catcher suddenly expose hidden reserves of tenderness and simple decency . There is one bad apple , and that is Katie , the beautiful prostitute with whom Catcher Bruce is in love . Unlike the cliche harlot of fiction , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only when she learns that he is dying will she agree to marry him , and then only on condition that she become the beneficiary of Bruce 's insurance policy . As the catcher 's insurance agent as well as his friend ( Wiggen 's off-season job is selling policies ) , the pitcher foils Katie . <P> Catcher Pearson dies , but by that time Narrator Wiggen and Author Harris have made their point : scratch a ballplayer and you find a human being , a taxpayer , a batter in the game of life whose exhilaration at pitching a shutout or swatting a homer with the bases full is apt to be balanced at any time by an ignominious strikeout or a sad walk to the showers . As the theme of a novel , this carries its own banality if only because no decent reader would want to quarrel with it . What makes Bang the Drum Slowly unique in current fiction is Author Harris ' mastery of his offbeat scene . His charr:ters all talk alike , and so the dialogue begins to sound monotonous , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earthiness and more than a touch of locker-room obscenity . If the characters are no more than onedimensional , it is a dimension that Harris has measured with his heart as well as his eye and ear . It is true that Author Harris ' major success lies in stirring up reminders of Ring Lardner , but it is equally true that not many people now writing can do that much .
