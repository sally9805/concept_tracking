I AM writing the article for which you asked with the greatest reluctance . In the first place , it may already be too late to speak about the chances of peace . Further , I can speak only for myself , as a citizen . of a nation that has lost the initiative in international politics . If in this period of crisis I reply to your invi  --  tation , it is principally because I promised you the reply in somewhat less gloomy times . But it is also because you have a right to know the opinions of Frenchmen , though I am only one among forty million . How many Frenchmen think as I do I can not say ; but I know they are many . You will no doubt take me to task for saying that " the United States should do this or that " and never that " Russia should . " For one thing I am voicing a wish and not giving advice ; for another , if in this article I treat the Soviet Union as the fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely because some American journalists are eager to hear European opin  --  ions , and Soviet journalists are not . This is an advantage which the United States still has over the Soviet Union . And if I have nothing agreeable to say to you , that shows Europe still believes it possible to say in the American press what one believes to be the truth , even when the truth is not pleasant . You ask on what conditions Russia and the United States can transform the present cold or lukewarm war into lasting peace . It seems to me that the first of these conditions is to want peace ; this alone is not sufficient , but it is an essential ? I am well aware that each opponent is convinced he seeks peace , while the other wants war . But you must remember that in France we are in the zone both of Soviet influence ( as your Burnham has said ) and of American influence ( as Ehrenburg claims ) . We hear the hour strike on both clocks ; we know both arguments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not think Europeans have snap answers to these questions . Of the U. S. S. R. we only know what it allows us to know . But neither is American policy easy for us to understand . We read , in our papers and in yours , the most conflict  --  ing statements , some of them attributed to leading figures in your government . For instance , on Feb ruary 17 , 1950 , Dean Rusk , testifying before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , affirmed that " the American government was ready to discuss all problems with the U. S. S. R. and was leaving every door open for an exchange of views . " And on February 23 Mr. Acheson , in a speech released on March 10 , said , " We are engaged in a decisive struggle ; the fate of mankind is at stake exactly as in the war against Nazism . " So far as one can judge from this distance , the Re  --  publican Party , or certain sections of it , favors a policy of force to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this policy can be carried out only if supported by American public opinion . Propa  --  ganda has therefore been utilized to foster an anti-Communist " climate . " Now your anti-communism is much more dangerous than ours  --  for a strange reason : that you have no Communists . Frenchmen who hate Communists or fervently condemn Soviet policy meet Communists every day and everywhere . Thus , how  --  ever violent their antipathy , they have to recognize that their opponents are men and not devils ; they know that it is possible to talk to a Communist . It is diffi  --  cult and irritating and does not always give results , but it is possible . In short , for French anti-Communists , Communists are a civilian adversary . For Americans they are already a military enemy . And because the enemy is unseen and unknown , he is the devil and must be fought to the death . Moreover , he appears to be everywhere , just because he can not be pinned down in a definite place ; suspicion grows , infects everybody . Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With us , if a man belongs to the party , we think him perhaps a fanatic ; with you he is of necessity a traitor , because by definition he is ranged on the enemy side . And since communism is evil , all that is evil is Communist . In that way we try to explain the paradox that the United States , which has virtually no Communists and where there is not the slightest danger of a red revolution , is obsessed by fear of communism . It is ' because it fears treason much more than revolution . The American public , it appears to us , has been so blinded and exacerbated that it has gradually acquired a war mentality . The members of your government , al  --  though they belong to the Democratic Party , seem ter  --  rorized by this attitude and are driven into applying a sort of exaggerated Republican policy . I know nothing more dangerous for a government than to pursue the policy of its opponents ; it always makes it lose the game . If everyone agrees upon Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not vote Republican ? Moreover , an unwill  --  ing government applies a policy now softly , now fiercely ; the brakes scream , there are sudden skids . Finally the opposition interferes , raises the bid , makes absurd pro  --  posals knowing it is not responsible . Is this the goal of the reaction ? In any case , in an atmosphere of hysteria liberties are increasingly restricted . TOUR Manicheism leads you to divide people into two groups : everywhere , in France , in Italy , in the Far East , you find the good and the bad . The good are those who take your side , the wicked those who do not , or only partially . But those who are on your side , even in countries where Communists really exist , reach that pitch of hysteria to which the absence of Communists brought you , and become the wildest reactionaries and even fascists . Citizens of the United States find in them a violence of feeling like their own , but that is the only common ground . These people are opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , hostile to the American spirit ; among them are Greek monarchists , Chiang Kai-shek 's corrupt minions , Franco 's Falange . Your ethics are generous and puritanical , but you pursue a policy which contradicts them . Unfortunately , Soviet cunning leaves you no support but that of oppressive minorities . The Communists everywhere defend the ex  --  ploited and oppressed  --  though they feel free to abandon them if Russian interest demands it . To this you answer , and you are right , that in Rus  --  sia there is a concentration-camp government . But what do starving Korean peasants care about the Russian penal system ? Or even undernourished French workers , when their just strike is being supported by the Communist Party ? You can not persuade people whose opinion is already formed . As a result , the U. S. S. R. without mak  --  ing any overt move , without compromising its posi  --  tion , can touch off or support uprisings , revolutions , or civil wars wherever it wishes . In many countries com  --  munism has won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sympathizers are not numer  --  ous enough and are often not strong enough to defend themselves ; they depend on your aid , and you can only help them by open intervention . If Franco is admitted to the United Nations and if the Spaniards try to over  --  turn him , what will you do ? Will you go so far as to defend him ? This brings us back to the war . Because you lack an aggressive and dynamic doctrine , and allies capable of self-defense , you are forced against your better judg  --  ment to threaten to use the only weapon you really have at your disposal  --  the atomic bomb . But that is too much or not enough . It is too much , because you can  --  not use it without starting a world war ; it is not enough , because the enemy knows very well that millions of peo  --  ple in your country and among your allies will protest697 its use . He can in consequence go a long way before you will carry out your threats . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time the most pacific nation in the world . The Russians , on the other hand , are pacific neither by tradition nor by doc  --  trine . Thus it is a surprising reversal to find the United States beating the war drums and the Soviet Union talking peace . I know that this is a Russian maneuver , that the Stockholm peace pledge and the peace con  --  gresses are weapons . Yet the fact that the Soviet govern  --  ment never needs to intervene directly permits it to rally the pacifists ; whereas the United States has never been able to use its own social progress and desire for peace as offensive weap  --  ons in the cold war . Many of us here ask ourselves whether the Soviet attitude makes war inevitable . But what matters today is not what we think but what you think . And that , I believe , is why so many Ameri  --  cans who want peace are deeply troubled when your press sometimes un  --  derestimates and some  --  times exaggerates the industrial , military , and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pear that in general you have tended to under  --  estimate the military po tential of the Russians , who at present have the best army in the world , and to overestimate the power of the atomic bomb . China does not seem a good target , and the Soviet industries are difficult to reach . If Russia invaded Europe and took over our armament industry , would you not be forced , by public opinion and the ultimate necessities of war , to bomb us ? On the other hand , Americans have been asking anxiously whether the concentration of industry in the United States does not make their own country the most vul  --  nerable . All this you know far better than I , and that gives me hope . In view of the cleavages among the Atlantic Pact nations , European mobilization is extremely doubtful , especially if one remembers that it would take place under the threat of twenty-five fully armed Russian divi  --  sions stationed in Germany . Later , if we should be occupied , an organized resistance would accomplish lit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German oc  --  cupation 90 per cent of the population was for the Resistance or , at worst , was neutral . But if new Ameri  --  can landings were attempted , the resistance of the Euro  --  pean Communists might prove very effective . In any case , you are perfectly aware that Europe is in no posi  --  tion to oppose a Russian invasion , since you have re  --  peatedly said that it would take several years to fit a European army for the field . Surely , then , you do not want to wage war tomorrow , since the immediate result would be to weld into one vast continent the Soviet Union , Asia , and an occupied and exploited Europe . This , ironically , is exactly the result that the bellicose wish to avoid by war . So why reproach your European allies for their defeatism , their cowardice ? To declare war today on China would practically be to abandon Europe to a Russian occupation . When you now ask US to follow your lead  --  at the very moment that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined for us  --  are you not really asking us , not to fight at your side , but to resign ourselves to the occu  --  pation from which you claimed you would save us ? And afterward ? Afterward it will be a long while before you can land an army on this immense con  --  tinent . At the moment to go to war means only to declare it , to let Europe be invaded , and to carry out a few bombardments which will certainly not succeed in un  --  dermining Russian morale . I comfort myself with the thought that you want peace , you can only want peace . And yet THOSE among you who believe war can be won by air power are the ones who say that war is necessary . They say that time fights for the U. S. S. R. , which amounts to saying : if we do not begin hostilities , the Rus  --  sians will , in their own good time . But what do you really know about it ? We Europeans have only signs to go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways according to our interests or our animosities . Are you better informed than we ? President Truman re  --  ferred to the existence of a peace party in Russia in 1948 and let it be understood that Stalin-was anxious for bet  --  ter international relations and was a " prisoner of the Politburo . " What has happened to this peace party ? It is no longer mentioned . Was the President mistaken ? One could cite a hundred examples to show that two interpretations of Soviet policy have always been made in official American circles . In Roosevelt 's opinion , Stalin 's reiterated declarations that the capitalist and Communist systems could coexist in peace were to be taken seriously . Others have believed , according to the Associated Press , that " every Russian attempt to arrive at a truce in the cold war must be considered a maneuver to gain time for a new offensive . " How to decide , who is to decide , between these two views so long as the general settle  --  ment by the Big Four or Five , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did the Russians unleash the North Koreans on the South Koreans , or did they simply do nothing to prevent the conflict from breaking out ? Could they have pre  --  vented it without compromising their position in Asia ? If the Soviet Union had opposed the Korean attempt , would not its Chinese partner have regarded such in  --  tervention as a white attempt to meddle in affairs which are the concern only of the yellow races ? I must confess that I can not find proof of a Soviet intrigue . On the con  --  trary , I note that the Soviet press has shown relative moderation throughout the Korean campaign , and that Russia soft-pedaled the affair of the Soviet plane downed by American planes . General MacArthur 's armies crossed the Thirty-eighth Parallel regardless of Chinese warnings . President Tru  --  man 's advisers found no merit in Great Britain 's pro  --  posal to halt the advance . Was no one aware of the importance China attached to Korea ? Was China ex  --  pected to be satisfied with a few assurances ? How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was excluded from the U. N. ? These are ample grounds for Mao Tse-tung 's decision to intervene . Yet in your opinion it is the Soviet Union that is to blame . The only way to counter such an interpretation of the situation  --  which , if not false , is at least unproved  --  is to try to arrive at a general settlement of international problems , if there is still time . This brings up the ques  --  tion : Suppose Russia is not determined upon war , is it possible to find bases for agreement ? Are not its inter  --  ests and ours everywhere opposed ? This war toward which we are heading presents a very different aspect from other wars . Ordinarily a con  --  flict of interests is disguised as an ideological dispute . This time opposed ideologies will be disguised as con  --  flicting interests . Since the cold war has achieved the division of the world into two autarchic systems both of which manage to function , their coexistence in peace must also be possible . When you say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you mean that they are not inevitably driven to this imperialism by their economy . Thus your own arguments prove that basically you believe what you so often deny : that the two economic systems can coexist . Your policy is inspired by an emotional and abstract idealism rather than by a realistic awareness of your interests . When the United States backed Chiang Kai-shek , nothing could have been more natural , more realistic , more in conformity with its traditional policy . Yet you did not like the policy of Chiang Kai-shek , or his advisers , or the corruption of his officials , or his vaguely dictatorial ideology . The same realism should oblige you to approach Mao Tse-tung , although you like neither his ideology nor his social reforms . Your con  --  tinued support of Chiang Kai-shek is an example of your anti-Communist psychosis and shows how a purely nega December 30 , 1950 tive policy can shrivel to a mere abstraction . The only intelligent China policy would have been that which the Soviet Union  --  for its own reasons  --  wished you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissuade you from complying . It would have been better to abandon all illusions , and to understand that recogni  --  tion of the Peking government was the only way left to you to remain in Asia . Your Russian policy should have been inspired by the realistic and concrete principle that one might as well give , even to an opponent , what it is to one 's interest to give him , and that it is foolish to risk doing oneself an injury by refusing him something which later must be abandoned to him . Russia would not have been weak  --  ened had you received Mao Tse-tung into the U. N. , but Chinese-American relations would have been im  --  proved , and the Korean war might not have occurred . W OULD you like other examples of your abstract approach ? Consider the Atlantic Pact , or German rearmament . Here as elsewhere the oppositions disap  --  pear as soon as the concrete aspects of the situation are examined . In the last analysis the Atlantic Pact is an abstraction , and as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed . If war broke out tomorrow , its only result would be , as Forrestal said , to " enrich the aggressor with the booty of northern Italy , the Ruhr , Sweden , and France . " Meanwhile the pact irritates the Russians more than it worries them . It has aroused the insurmountable opposition of all the Communist parties of Europe and driven them to block European recon  --  struction in every possible way ; and it has ranged the people of all the Western democracies  --  except England ? in two camps , ready , in the event of war , to tear them  --  selves to pieces . Everyone of these nations has become , instead of a cushion against war , a danger spot . Western Europe can serve as a buffer zone between America and Russia only if it belongs to neither . Act  --  ing in good faith , the two powers could aid in the renaissance of an independent Europe , principally on the basis of a social program . It may be said that this solution favors the U. S. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country . But once more the objection is abstract , since these Communist parties already exist and can not be rooted out by ter  --  ror and since they are , in the main , identified with the proletariat . At the present time the nervous , hesitating anti-communism on which you lean does not even have the strength which would be derived from your unquali  --  fied support , though it may be strong enough to touch off civil war . Over here , you know , German rearmament and the Korean war , at least in their latest develop  --  ments , have almost succeeded in awakening doubt and anxiety among your own supporters . In the last few months your generosity , which a short while ago aroused our enthusiasm , has seldom appeared disinterested enough to be owed unmixed gratitude . The moment that you cease to regard us as soldiers , you will redis  --  cover us as friends . As neutrals but determined to resist every aggression , we shall be more useful to the cause of peace than we could be to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off our old Socialist parties . A lasting clgtente would permit them to be re  --  constituted in a new form . They could then fight against the Communist parties , not from above , by vainly trying to disband them , but on the working-class and peasant level , by a democratic policy of social reform . And Germany ? Is not its division into zones an ab  --  straction ? Is not the project of rearming half a nation to fight the other half mere abstract theory ? What is it you fear ? You have said often enough that there was almost universal opposition to the Communist regime in the Russian zone , and that only the presence of the Red Army prevented its expression . Does realism consist in prolonging an occupation that incites each half of Germany against the other and against the occupying power ? This in itself renders the withdrawal of Alliedtroops daily more difficult . With a general settlement in view , should not the date and terms of the evacuation of Germany by all the armies of occupation be discussed ? Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of future German elections ? I have only tried to give examples . I have no au  --  thority to present a general plan ; indeed , it might seem comic for me to do so . But everyone has a right to make clear the spirit in which he hopes negotiations will be undertaken . If you resolve to work for peace and to believe in it , if you renew your confidence in democracy , in social progress at home and abroad , if you every  --  where support , not the narrowest anti-communism , but progressive and democratic forces , there will be a mil  --  lion-to-one chance of peace . The choice between you and the Russians is one be  --  tween cynics and madmen . But there is still among you a powerful minority which believes democratic ideology is not played out but will have the strength to make headway if it can find a way to adapt itself to new condi  --  tions . If this minority could become the majority for a single day , the whole world would renew its faith in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated risk " policy , risking not war but peace . That is what many Frenchmen and Europeans wish ; that is what they never get a chance to say to Americans . I believe that they will be grateful to The Nation for having allowed one of them to express his views . These contacts , these free discussions , if multiplied , might also increase the chance of peace . DOROTHY S.
