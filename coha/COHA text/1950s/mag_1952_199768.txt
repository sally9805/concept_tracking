When Rudolf Bing ends his third season as general manager of the Metropolitan Opera next spring , he will have completely restyled twelve operas and achieved a good part of what he was hired to do , i.e. , make Met productions a consistent pleasure to the eye as well as the ear . He has not been able to cure the Met 's chronic deficits ( last year 's : about $475,000 ) , but the directors are content . Last week , to nobody 's surprise , they signed Bing up for another three years .
