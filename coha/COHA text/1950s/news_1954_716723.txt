txt How would a 3 per cent sales tax affect various family groups in Massachusetts ? Organized labor and other groups have long opposed a sales tax on the ground that it would weigh heaviest on persons least able to pay . On the other hand . advocates of a sales tax which exempts food for home consumption , and items already hit with excise taxes such as gasoline , liquor and cigarettes , and prescription drugs , have disputed the claim . Apparently both are right to a degree , according to a report by the Special Commission on Taxation . This report is receiving renewed attention as a result of last week 's recommendation by the Fiscal Survey Commission for a 3 per cent sales tax to produce $100,000,000 additional revenue to solve pressing state and municipal financial problems . Returns Estimated According to the taxation commission , a 2 per cent sales tax , with food for home consumption and prescription drugs exempt , would take $10.83 a year from a four-person city family with a $2,000-a-year income , $18.42 from such a family with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $36.80 for the $5,000 group , $46.65 for the $6,000-a-year family , and $82.98 for the family with a $10,000 income . The corresponding figures for a 3 per cent sales tax are $16.25 , $27.63 , $39.53 , $55.20 , $99.98 , and $129.47 . Thus the proponents of a sales tax score a point in their claim that there is an element of progressivity in a sales tax , with higher income groups paying a bigger tax total . However , the commission points out that the percentage of income spent for sales-taxed items would range only from .54 per cent for the family with a $2,000 annual income to .83 per cent for the $10,000-a-year family , a spread of less than 3/10ths of 1 per cent . Results Surveyed As a result of these figures , the Special Commission on Taxation , concluded that : " First , although a retail sales tax containing the exemptions indicated would have a progressive effect on the groups studied , this effect is minor when compared with the progression exhibited by the exist ing Massachusetts and New York income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were adopted in substitution for the Massachusetts income tax , the tax incidence would be shifted considerably to those in the lower income groups . However , while a particular tax may be considered progressive or regressive , its over-all effect must be measured in terms of the effect of such a tax on the progressivity or regressivity of the entire tax structure . " The taxation commission pointed out that the Massachusetts income-tax burden progresses from .24 per cent for the S4,000-a-year income group to 1.65 per cent for the $10,000-a-year family . In New York the range for the same groups goes from .14 per cent to 1.87 per cent.1 Higher Yield Seen While the Fiscal Survey Commission estimates the sales tax yield at about $33,000,000 for each 1 per cent tax , the Special Commission on Taxation estimates the yield at $34,000,000 for each 1 per cent tax . However , other estimates have placed the revenue yield at up to $45,000,000 for each 1 per cent tax . While the Fiscal Survey Commission sales-tax plan calls for distribution of $30,000,000 of the $100,000,000 estimated annual revenue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate , the Special Commission on Taxation report indicates that the average homeowner actually would pay more in total taxes under a sales tax program than before . The taxation commission said : " It is difficult to show conclusively the effect of the imposition of a state sales tax upon local property rates . The assumption is that in instances where the state distributed additional aid to local governments from sales tax revenues , the result was a lower property tax . " Meanwhile , the Massachusetts Federation of Labor has started a counteroffensive against the sales-tax proposal . Kenneth J. Kelley , **31;565;TOOLONG agent of the federation , which has long advocated a graduated state income tax , announced formation of a special committee to propose interim taxes to provide additional revenue until a graduated tax can be adopted . To put through a graduated tax would require a state constitutional amendment , a task which would take at least until 1960 to complete .
