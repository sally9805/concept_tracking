On the wall of the public registrar 's office in the village of Campogalliano ( 5 miles off the main road from Modena to Bologna ) , hangs a large portrait of Garibaldi . From under beetling brows , the old revolutionary soldier looks down on two municipal workers : Ostilio Iotti , 26 , whose wife is rich but not pretty , and Santina Caffani , a widow of 30 or more . Together they keep the village records and accounts . Last summer a rumor sprang up that Ostilio and Santina were more to each other than coworkers ; the sofa in the registrar 's office was often mentioned in these rumors . <P> " A Strange Twinkle . " Ostilio and Santina are Christian Democrats . The village mayor , councillors and all the other officials are Communists . They decided to get rid of Ostilio and Santina . A few weeks ago the Communists brought from Modena the official party photographer , Mario Botti . He set up his camera in the room adjoining the registrar 's office , drilled a hole through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered through Garibaldi 's eye . <P> After three days of waiting , Photographer Botti got what he had been told to get , or so he said . A click of the camera caused Ostilio to look up . He noticed what he later described as " a strange twinkle in Garibaldi 's eye . " Ostilio and Santina rushed into the next room , as the photographer and two town councillors fled . <P> The town councillors delivered their negatives to Communist Mayor Guido Gialdi as " evidence . " Gialdi suspended Ostilio and Santina , and forwarded prints of the negatives with a report to the provincial prefect . The prefect , an appointee of Italy 's Christian Democratic government , ordered Ostilio and Santina reinstated until a formal hearing could be held . Ostilio and Santina filed a suit against the mayor for " defamation and slander . " <P> Overtime for the Mayor . Campogalliano buzzed . Ostilio , said neighbors , had been beaten with a matterello ( rolling pin ) by his wife , who greatly outweighs him , and confined to his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . Said Ostilio : " She 's just an office colleague . " Said Santina of Ostilio : " Among other things , I do n't like his mustache . " Santina opened a counteroffensive . Said she : " I could tell you a few things about the mayor . He often got me to work overtime in his office , and he has a pair of very long hands indeed . " <P> Any compromising photographs , the bookkeepers maintained , could only be a clever photomontage . Photographer Botti told the police he had been hired by Mayor Gialdi , paid 4,000 lire , plus expenses , by a town councillor . Said he : " Professional secrecy prohibits me from describing the pictures of the love scenes . " Mayor Gialdi said that two of the shots were " definitely compromising. "
