txt A dime-size piece of germanium metal that changes alternating into direct electric current was announced here . Six of these would change all the current in the average-size home . The added wiring needed by each makes it about as big as a piece of lump sugar . The usual devices of equal power now in use by industry are about the size of a case of ginger ale . The announcement was made to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers by E. A. Harty of the Lynn , Mass. , works of the General Electric Company . This germanium metal is queer about clectric , ity . It will transmit current in only one direction . The dime is sandwiched into the common alternating current circuit . The current going in one direction passes through , but ' current in the opposite direction is stopped . The result is current flowing only in one direction on the far side of the dime . A strange fact is that there is hardly any power loss . The dime has a secret process . It is made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is melted so that it forms a single crystal in the shape of a rod a foot long and big around as your finger . The pieces are sliced from this rod .
