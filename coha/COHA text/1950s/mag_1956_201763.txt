THE Chicago that Boston-born Louis Sullivan first saw as a fledgling draftsman of 17 was a vast expanse of gutted ruins , the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1871 . Sidewalks were temporary wooden structures ; pavements oozed mud . But for Sullivan it was love at first sight . He could foresee that up from the ruins would burgeon a new city . <P> Chicago was reborn during two drama-packed decades of engineering breakthroughs ( hydraulic elevators , fireproof hollow tile , new foundation planning , and the first steel skeleton construction-the Home Insurance Building ) that set the stage for the major U.S. contribution to architecture : the skyscraper . And in this new Chicago it was to be Louis Sullivan who first gave the soaring office building its logical and definitive form . To mark the tooth anniversary of Sullivan 's birth , Chicago architects last week were sponsoring a dazzling roundup of his work in Chicago 's Art Institute . Based largely on huge blowups from a photo essay by Photographer John Szarkowski ( The Idea of Louis Sullivan ; University of Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan , the man his old pupil , Frank Lloyd Wright , still refers to as Lieber Meister , as the first U.S. poet of the skyscraper . <P> " Form Follows Function . " Architect Sullivan had already put in a year at M.I.T. ( he entered at 16 ) and two years at Paris ' Ecole des Beaux Arts before he was taken on in 1880 as partner by one of Chicago 's top engineers , Dankmar Adler . During the 15 years-the two men worked together , they drafted plans for more than 100 buildings , including Chicago 's Auditorium Building , Stock Exchange and a score of office buildings that set trends throughout the Midwest . <P> Sullivan 's major contribution was to establish the skyscraper as an architectural form in its own right . One of his best is Buffalo 's Guaranty ( now Prudential ) Building ( left ) , finished in 1895 at the peak of Sullivan 's powers , just before his partnership with Adler broke up . In designing it Sullivan broke away from the neoclassic-temple design that obsessed his contemporaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he created instead a building that clearly expressed its own purpose : a foundation of ground display shops , a center block of identical office floors and a crowning attic with a handsome cornice . <P> <P> Imperative Emotion . But for Sullivan , " function " was not bare-boned utilitarianism . Once the problem is analyzed , he insisted , " We must heed the imperative voice of emotion . " This meant exalting the loftiness of the building as " the very open organ-tone of its appeal . " For Sullivan , the organ-tone required its grace notes as well : the wrought-iron and terracotta decoration he lavished on his buildings , inside and out ( opposite ) . <P> Sullivan 's exuberant geometric and floral motifs are now long out of fashion . But for the present generation of modern architects too long imprisoned in a strait-jacket of glassy steel and aluminum purism , his concern for structure , color and decoration today places Sullivan , who died almost forgotten in 1924 , once again at the center of tomorrow 's architectural aspirations .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
