txt Seldom , if ever , has an American President-elect faced more complex and urgent problems , both domestic and foreign , than await Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , now preparing to get his first briefing from President Truman . In addition to taking over the reins of American foreign policy on the far-flung front , the President-elect has the immediate and urgent task of bringing together in working unity the two extreme wings of the Republican Party . In order to make his party strong and control it . he must reconcile such . divergent leaders as Gov . Thomas E. Dewey of New York and Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , or at least find a compromise between them . Governor Dewey now has made it clear that he will not be a candidate for the cabinet , at least until his present term as Governor is up .

It is believed that if anyone can accomplish this feat , it is the persuasive general who has had such success in the past in getting teamwork out of the divergent European camps . That he intends to approach this task tactfully with an ear to both sides is seen in the advisers he brought together in Georgia and in the fact that he is conferring with both Governor Dewey and Senator Taft before he leaves for Korea . That for his part Governor Dewey feels he will be most useful and influential for a time , at least , behind the scenes is spelled out clearly in General Eisenhower 's announcement following his conference with the Governor . to whom he obviously had offered a Cabinet post .
