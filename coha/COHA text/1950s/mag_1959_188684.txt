Glaring in the darkness like some colossal firework , a 98-ft. rocket blasted off a launching pad at Cape Canaveral , Fla. one night last week . As it zoomed skyward , trailing a gaudy glow of reds and greens , a watcher in the Canaveral blockhouse gasped out an awed , unscientific tribute : " Is n't she beautiful ? " <P> The biggest rocket the U.S. had ever launched , a three-stage Atlas-Able , was off on the U.S. 's most ambitious space shot so far . The mission : to send an intricate , 372-lb. payload of instruments into the vicinity of the moon-and if all went well , into orbit around the moon . The rocket also carried a weighty cargo of hope and national pride : Nikita Khrushchev had kicked off his trip to the U.S. with the Russian moon shot ; a U.S. answer exploded on the pad while he was in the U.S. Here , on the eve of the President 's grand tour , was the U.S. 's chance to catch up . <P> Into the Sea . Some 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell off the rocket and hurtled into the sea . " I 've never seen this before , " growled a watching Air Force officer . " We 're in trouble . We 're in trouble . I 'm sure we are . " The rocket kept soaring until it disappeared from sight out over the Atlantic . But an hour later Program Director Adolph K. Thiel , somber and red-eyed , told waiting newsmen the unhappy news : " We did n't make it . Something happened . We do n't know what . " <P> By piecing together radar and telemetry data , film sequences and fragments of wreckage dipped from the shallow waters off the cape , missilemen managed to figure out what went wrong : the loft . long fiber glass " nose fairing " that was supposed to protect the third stage and payload from air friction and buffeting in the upper atmosphere fell off prematurely , after 40 seconds instead of the programed 4 minutes . Then the fierce drag of the atmosphere wrenched the payload-carrying third stage loose , made the second stage malfunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an adequate space program , the next step would be to remedy the trouble with the nose fairing and try again . But the shocking fact is that the U.S. has no more Atlas-Able rockets available for trying again . All the Atlases allotted to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have already been assigned to other urgent space programs , and NASA has no spare funds to order additional Atlases . The bigger space vehicles that NASA has under development will not be ready for launching for more than a year : Vega ( Atlas plus upper stages ) in 1961 , Centaur ( Atlas plus more powerful upper stages ) in 1962 , Saturn ( eight Jupiters clustered together ) in 1963 , Nova ( giant single-chamber rocket ) in the mid-1960s . <P> NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan complains about Congress ' " crippling " cuts in NASA funds . But in fact Congress trimmed NASA funds in the current fiscal year by less than 6%-from $530 million to $500 million-and Glennan helped bring on that cut himself when he argued at a congressional hearing that extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
