( See Cover ) Not since Henry Ford put the nation on wheels with his model T has such a great and sweeping change hit the auto industry . Out from Detroit and into 7,200 Chevrolet showrooms this week rolled the radically designed Corvair , first of the Big Three 's new generation of compact cars . Smaller and simpler than Detroit 's chromespun standards , the Corvair is like no other model ever mass-produced in the U.S. ; its engine is made of aluminum and cooled by air , and it is mounted in the rear . To Chevrolet 's folksy , brilliant General Manager Edward N. Cole , 50 , who is as square and compact ( 195 Ibs. , 5 ft. 9 in. ) as a Corvair , the new car marks the fulfillment of a 15-year dream ; for that long , off and on , he has been trying to produce a rear-engine car . Says Ed Cole jubilantly : " If I felt any better about our Chevy Corvair , I think I 'd blow up . " <P> Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Chevrolet announced the Corvair than it began to write orders . Hertz Rent-A-Car signed up for 3,000 . Chicago Dealer Zollie Frank wanted 10,000 , but Chevy turned him down to spread the supply . St. Louis Dealer Gene Jantzen has a unique ringside seat in the small-car derby ; his showroom is right across from a Chevy assembly plant . Says he : " People toured that plant and peeked through the knotholes at the Corvair . Some even climbed atop their cars outside the plant to get a look . Then they came over to our place and ordered a Corvair . " So far , Chevy has totted up 33,000 Corvair orders . <P> " The Most Interesting Year . " The other Detroit compact cars are also firing up great expectations in the marketplace . Next week Ford , rushing up its introduction by two months to catch Corvair , brings out its front-engine Falcon . Late this month Chrysler , advancing its debut from February 1960 , bows with its front-engine Valiant . <P> This is just a prelude . Next spring Ford will roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buick , Oldsmobile and Pontiac will come in both compact and regular sizes . All told , Detroit is betting $700 million on these cars-about $150 million on the Corvair , $100 million each for Falcon and Valiant , $350 million for the " bigger " compacts . How well this huge gamble pays off will affect not only Detroit , but automakers and buyers round the world . Says West Germany 's Heinz Nordhoff , president of Volkswagen , with some understatement : " 1960 will be the most interesting year in the history of the U.S. automobile industry . " <P> Chevy 's Ed Cole predicts that the 1960 compact cars will ring up 1,100,000 sales , lead the industry to within a bumper 's reach of a 7,000,000-car year , the second biggest ( first : 1955 ) in U.S. history . " A market of this size , " says Cole , " should see sales of 300,000 Corvairs , 250,000 Falcons , 150,000 Valiants , 400,000 Studebaker Larks and American Ramblers , not counting bigger Rambler Ambassadors .
