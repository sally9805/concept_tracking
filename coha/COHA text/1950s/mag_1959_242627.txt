THE MAN FROM KANGAROO LAND IS STILL HOPPING ALONG . <P> SAM ROWLEY KIND REGARDS TO ALL FRIENDS . <P> AUSTRALIA 'S LITTLE COMEDIAN . <P> A COMEDIAN WITH A BIG VOICE . <P> DIRECT FROM THE ANTIPODES . <P> - Variety , Nov. 23 , 1907 The personal squibs that once filled pages of the self-styled " Bible of Show Business " also filled a real need : without them a performer might be forgotten . <P> Today the battle for bookings is usually fought on other fronts , but self-advertise ment in Variety and other trade papers survives , a kind of tribal custom to which just about everybody in the business succumbs at least once a year . And it still fills a real need : without it the trade papers might go broke . <P> Last week that ancient advertising rite was celebrated in Variety 's 53rd annual anniversary issue , a hefty ( 2 lbs. , 6 oz. ) , 290-page publishing phenomenon ( 457 different ads ) representing the combined efforts of ten operatives who spent a hectic six weeks putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin 's " best wishes " and signature on an other wise white page ( price : $500 ) to a fifth-of-a-page , rear-end view of Actress Shirley MacLaine ( $110 ) . <P> <P> Bulletin Board . The anniversary issue was hardly must reading on Broadway ( as weekly Variety usually is ) , even for the advertisers who had subsidized it . In Hollywood , just a few months before , many of them had felt a similar bite for the 28th anniversary issue of the Hollywood Reporter ( 384 pp. ) and the silver jubilee issue of Daily Variety ( 436 pp . ) . Some of them were beginning to wonder if the publicity was worth the price . Purred Actress Faye Emerson : " Whenever I open in anything , the very next day a woman calls from Variety and says . ' Did you see our nice review ? Oh , by the way , we have a special edition coming up . Would n't you like to take an ad ? ' Usually I can think of ways I 'd much rather spend my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't read Variety . I 'm not all that interested in all the economic stuff they run . It 's a kind of a weekly bulletin board where they put up who 's doing what and where you leave messages . Besides , it rubs off on white gloves . " <P> Despite such occasional complaints , no one seriously suggests that placing an ad or failing to place one can influence Variety 's reviews . For the most part , the paper 's salesmen run into surprisingly little sales resistance . In the old days , before the show-business community decided that honest sheets such as Variety deserved a little support , Variety salesmen were forced to practice the hard-sell , often found it even harder to collect . Many a buck-and-wing team was trailed from Times Square to Peoria before its bill was paid . <P> Bread &; Butter . Speaking for the large majority of those who willingly shelled out , Musicman Meredith Willson ( full-page picture , no name ) explained : " I shudder to think of the hole in show-business life if there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denver , what hotel my people are staying in , when they are coming in where , how the competition is in New Haven , the ratings of my songs . My bread and butter is all right there , and this is my way of saying ' Thanks . ' "
