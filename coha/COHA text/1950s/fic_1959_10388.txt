" But when he weighed all consequences he apparently decided against this , for he suddenly turned to his burly executionerand said softly , " Tomorrow I do n't want you at any time to stand either near the king or near Teroro . Keep completely away . You , Rere-ao , " and he addressed his spy , " are you as swift of club as you once were ? " " I am .

" " Do I wait for a signal from you ? " Rere-ao asked . " No , but as you strike I will point at him , and his dead body will be sacred to Oro .

" The High Priest concluded his meeting with a long prayer to Oro , at the end of which he told his men , " One way or another , tomorrow will see Bora Bora finally delivered to Oro . The old gods are dead . Oro lives . " His assistant priests breathed deeply with excitement , for their struggle to implant their new god on the backs of Tane and Ta'aroa had not been easy , and for several months they had longed for some positive event of magnitude to assure them that they had won . Their leader , sensing this desire for the spectacular , cautioned them : " There are many roads to ultimate victory , my brothers . Oro has many paths by which he can travel to triumph . Tomorrow one of them will result in his final capture of Bora Bora , but you must not anticipate which one . That is up to Oro . " With this the High Priest folded his hands , took off his skullcap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oro . His fellow priests did likewise , and in the deep silence of the night , dimly lit by distant fires and the glow of shimmering stars , the holy men prayed to their allpowerfulgod . It was a solemn moment at the end of an exciting day , a moment sweet and meaningful , with the essence of immortality hovering above the assembly , the sacrifices in place , great Oro brooding over his faithful , and all the world subdued in silent reverence to him . At such a moment , with the greatness of Oro pulsing in the night and throbbing in the veins more powerfully than the beat of a drum , it was incomprehensible to the priests that anyone should cling to old gods when the new deity was so powerful , so rational and so benevolent . Next morning Hiro the steersman was up early , and with a sharp rock hidden in tapa he slashed several of the sennit strands that bound **29;1454;TOOLONG , shuddering with regret as he did so , thenburying the rock and hurrying to the priest in charge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral . " The priest hurried to the canoe , which rested under the surveillance of the dead crewman lashed to the stern , and studied the broken sennit . " It can be mended with fresh cord , " he said , hoping to get the accident repaired before the High Priest blamed him for it . " Yes , " the crewman agreed , " and we ought to do it while we are all under the protection of Oro . " Such sentiment charmed the priest , and he was therefore receptive when Hiro suggested , " Would n't it be easier to drag the canoe out here , where the sun can tighten the new sennit ? " And they edged the canoe into the exact position Teroro required . " Will the mending take long ? " the priest asked . " No , " Hiro assured him . " I must n't miss the convocation of Oro . " " You must not , " the priest agreed , recalling the High Priest 's assurancesof the night before that on this day Oro would consolidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omen that Hiro , one of Teroro 's prominent supporters , had thus voluntarily signified his affection for Oro . The convocation began with a startling scene , so that all who later reviewed the day agreed that it had been doomed from the beginning , although at the time that was not apparent , since the priests had quickly converted an error into a blessing . The assembly had seated itself on rocks stretching out from the main altar , and the first two pigs were being disemboweled when a boy of seven came running into the temple , crying for his father who sat near the altar . " Father ! " the lost little child shouted . The man , a lesser chief of Havaiki , looked in horror at the approach of his son , for the boy had committed so vast a sin that no excuse could pardon it . No woman , or child , or animal had ever strayed into the temple , and the father 's arms trembled as he gathered the handsome little fellow to his heart . " I was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In austere silence the priests at the altar , their sacrifices to Oro interrupted , stared at the offending child . His father , aware of the tabu his family had broken , rose haltingly with the boy still in his arms . Suddenly , in an act of total dedication , he thrust his son toward the altar , the child 's hair falling over his father 's strong left arm . With anguished but unfaltering conviction the man spoke : " Take this child and sacrifice him to Oro ! For the consecration of the temple has been broken by him , the thread of our union with Oro has been entangled . He is my son . I begat him . But I do not weep in losing him , for he has outraged Oro . " At first the priests ignored the man and left him standing with the boyHAWAII 42in his arms while with haughty indifference they finished slaughtering the pigs . Then , with fresh blood for Oro on their hands , two priests picked up a pair of stout bamboo rods . Holding one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formed a giant pincers which they deftly dropped over the child 's head , one bamboo catching him at the nape of the neck , the other across the throat . With remorseless force they closed the pincers and held the little boy aloft until he strangled . Then , with one swift slash , the High Priest laid open the child 's stomach and ripped out the entrails , placing the body reverently on the highest altar , between the pigs . " This father does well , " the priest droned . " All do well who honor Oro . Great Oro , bringer of peace . " The incident unnerved Teroro , because he recognized it as an omen for this faithful day , but how to interpret it was beyond him , and for a moment in his perplexity he forgot his brother whom he had come to protect . " What could such an omen signify ? " he asked stubbornly , but no answer was forthcoming , so he breathed deeply and attended to his business ; yet when he looked across the temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position , he came upon a second omen which had to be interpreted as ominous : the present steersman sat directly under the swaying body of the earlier steersman who had been killed at the whim of the High Priest , and the corpse 's distended belly , already disintegrating in the tropical heat , hung heavy over Teroro 's accomplice , In confusion Teroro dismissed all omens and watched first the High Priest and then the king , for he was totally resolved to defy Oro , even if it had to be done in the very seat of the red god 's omnipotence . But he was not prepared for the High Priest 's strategy , for while Teroro was anticipating an entirely different tactic , the priest suddenly whirled and pointed his staff at one of the least offensive members of Teroro 's crew , and one of the finest warriors . " He ate of the sacred pig of Oro ! " the accuser shouted , but the young chief did not know why he died , for the burly executioner had anticipatedthe charge and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands , gratified that Oro was being protected from apostasy , chanted : " All-powerful is Oro , the peace-giver , Oro of the united islands . " As they continued their droning , Teroro sat stunned . The young chief had been his special friend , an unassuming warrior who could not possibly have eaten sacred pig . Why had he been sacrificed ? Teroro could not focus upon the problem . He had a fine plan to protect King Tamatoa , and he knew that if he himself were menaced , Mato would save him . But he had not foreseen the High Priest 's clever assault upon lesser members of the Bora Bora community . In dismay Teroro looked at the steersman , who stared with equal dismayat him . No answer was available there , so Teroro tried to catch the eyes of Mato and Pa , at the exit , but they were obsessed by the altar , 43 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonwhere the body of their companion now lay . The other members of Teroro 's plot were equally stunned , and in mounting confusion their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which they had convened . Of the Bora Bora contingent , only one man saw clearly in these awful moments . Tamatoa , like many successful kings , was gifted not with marked intellectual ability but with a powerful , stolid insight ; and he realized that the High Priest had determined not to assassinate Tamatoa and his brother , but to drive them from the islands by irresistible pressure , constantly applied . " He will avoid a direct confrontation , " the king reasoned . " There will be no battle . Patiently and with cunning he will alienate and terrify my people , and we will have to go . " Tamatoa was confirmed in his analysis when the High Priest whirled his staff of death at another member of Teroro 's crew , and the terrible club of death descended once more . Sick at heart , King Tamatoa looked at his younger brother and saw Teroro befuddled and distraught . The king thought : " He probably had some grandiose plan to save my life today , and probably the High Priest had spies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In his compassion , the king kept his eyes fixed on his brother until , bedazed , the latter looked up . Almost imperceptibly the older man shook his head , cautioning his brother not to act , not in any way . Teroro , catching the message , sat numb in fury . It was at this moment , in the sacred temple of Oro , with the bodies of his finest men dangling before him and strewn upon the altar , that King Tamatoa whispered in his heart : " Oro , you have triumphed . You are the ultimate god , and I am powerless to oppose you . " When he had said these words of contrition , a great peace came over him and he saw , as if in a revealing vision , how foolish he had been to combat the will of the inevitable . New gods were being born , and new gods conquer ; but what Tamatoa did not realize was that the contentment of soul which his confessioninduced was merely the prerequisite for a decision toward which he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hitherto retreated . Now that he had accepted the obvious  --  that Oro had conquered  --  the next obvious conclusion was easy to reach , and in the stillness of the morning Tamatoa said the fatal words for the first time , and in uttering them an enormous burden was lifted from his heart : " We will depart from Bora Bora and leave it to you , Oro . We will go upon the sea and find other islands where we can worship our own gods . " During the rest of the convocation , King Tamatoa did not confide his decision to anyone , not even to Teroro . In fact , he avoided his hotheadedyounger brother , but he did summon Mato , to whom he spoke harshly : " I hold you responsible for my brother 's life , Mato . If he has plots afoot , I am sure you are part of them . He must not die , even if you have to tie him to the canoe . He must not die . I need him now more than ever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun-Swept LagoonSo when Teroro convened his bewildered companions to dream up some new fantasy , Mato spoke first : " We must go back to Bora Bora and plan our revenge . " " We 'll go back and work out a plan , " shark-faced Pa seconded . With the decision taken from his hands Teroro could only mutter , " We will have revenge ! That we will have ! " and thinking only of some utter destruction and disaster , he bided his time . WHEN A CONVOCATION ended , the priests wisely withdrew and encouraged the population to release its tensions in a wild , spontaneous celebration that sometimes lasted for three days . Now women were free to join their men , and musicians crowded the night with echoes . Beautiful girls , flashing bits of brown radiance dressed in skirts of aromatic leaves , swept into the mad hula of Havaiki and danced provocatively before the visitors of other islands , as if to challenge : " Do the women of Tahiti have soft breasts like ours ? Can they move their knees to music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances and muttered to himself , " May the women of Havaiki be damned . " Teroro would take no part in the celebration . Neither the magic hammering of the excited drums , nor the sweet voices of older women chanting love songs , nor the beauty of the girls enticed him to join the dancers . When special beauties , their bodies illuminated by palm-frond torches and etched in smoke from the fires where pigs roasted , danced past him in direct invitation , he would look at the ground and mutter to himself , " I will destroy this island . I will kill every priest of Oro . I will desolate . . . " His men could not maintain such powerful resolve . One by one the young chiefs threw aside their spears , wiped their hands on their bare chests and leaped into the dancing circle , shouting and entering into the wild gyrations of the Havaiki hula . When they had driven themselves into an ecstasy , they would leap high into the air , slap their thighs and prance for a moment before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the other , and break into laughter , whereupon the girl would unconcernedly start to walk idly toward the shadows , her partner following with equal unconcern until at the last they gave a cry and rushed together to the seclusion of some protected glade . As they disappeared , old women in the chanting circle were free to hoot encouragement , usually of the grossest kind , at which the general audience roared with approval . " He 'll be tired before she is ! " one old woman predicted . " Show him what Havaiki 's famous for , Rere , " another screamed . " Do n't let him stop till he begs for mercy , " the first added . " Auwe ! " another cried . " Make the moon hide its face for shame ! " " Remember what I taught you , Rere ! " the first chanter shouted . " Do n't make him do all the work . " When the advice became almost unbearably clinical , the general audiencecollapsed into gales of merriment , the music halted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight the wildness of sex brought with it . Then the tiniest drum  --  no more than eight inches of hollowed-out branch beaten with a wand  --  would begin a wild , high rhythm that could almost compel a man to dance , and larger drums would pick it up , and soon some other of Teroro 's men would begin dancing with a dark Havaiki girl , and they too would go into the shadowsaccompanied by ribald advice from the lusty old women , for an island hula was meaningless unless at its climactic moment a man and woman so desired each other that they were propelled explosively into fulfillment . Teroro alone was not captured by the mystery and joy of this night . He did not even look up when the leading heckler shouted , " I always thought there was something wrong with the men of Bora Bora . Tetua , dance over there and tell me if he 's capable ! " A marvelous young girl of fifteen danced almost on Teroro 's toes , flashing her body very close to his . When he ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firerimmedcircle and shouted , " He ca n't do ! " The old woman cackled above the drums , " I keep wondering how they have babies on Bora Bora . Men from Havaiki must swim over at night ! " At this sally Teroro had to look up , and against his will he had to smile at the raucous old woman , for islanders loved wit and liked to acknowledge it , even when directed against themselves . The old chanter , seeing that she had pierced Teroro 's indifference , cried passionately . " Auwe ! If I were only twenty years younger , I 'd explain to you what men were made for ! " When the crowd roared she shouted , " I can even yet ! " And she started an outrageous hula , moving toward Teroro with her white hair dancing in the night and the memory of great sexual feats animating her hips . She was prepared to make a great fool of Teroro , but at this moment a famous chief of Havaiki , fat Tatai who guarded the temple , appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat with us , Teroro . " And he led the young chief away from the fires , but not away from the old woman 's biting tongue , for as the two men disappeared she screamed , " Oh , now I understand . It 's men he likes . " Fat Tatai laughed and said , " Only death will silence that one 's tongue . " He led Teroro to the outskirts of the village , where his imposing family grounds had for centuries been enclosed on three sides by a rock wall head-high , the fourth side free to open on the ocean . As he entered the enclosure , Teroro saw dimly eight or nine grass houses and he could identify each : the main sleeping hall , the women 's hall , the women 's cook house , and the separate houses for each of Tatars favorite wivesHAWAII 46 47 From the Sun-Swept LagoonIt was to the men 's area that fat Tatai took his guest , and there , in moonlight and to the music of waves , the feast was spread . Teroro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when to the west of the compound a tiny drum , beaten frantically with a length of wood , began its persuasive chatter , followed by the steadier throbbing of several big drums as the musicians entered . " I wonder why Tatai bothered to set such a feast for me ? " Teroro mused , pushing away the food . He wandered to a group seated by a fire and watched casually the figures that began to materialize from the night 's soft shadows . They were the women of the Havaiki chiefs , and in tones less raucous than Teroro had recently heard in the village square , they began the hauntingstrains of old island love songs , and the bitterness went out of his heart : " When the rolling surf And the rising moon And the swaying palm And the high white bird And the lazy fishAll speak of love , I cry in the night : Where are you , love ? " It was to the strains of this languorous island song that Teroro saw approaching him , in the gentle rhythms of a chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight-black hair that fell to her knees . She swayed delicately , her dark eyes fixed on the ground , but when the plaintive old song ended , she raised her right finger about two inches from the fall of her ti-leaf skirt , shimmering in the flares , and indicated a swifter beat , which the drums initiated . Now she danced on her toes , her knees and elbows out in an excitingly awkward position , with the fronds of her ti-leaf skirt whirling about her handsome legs . In this dance she allowed her face to show , and it was remarkably beautiful , and she brought it close to Teroro 's , her full young breasts almost brushing his hands . Against his will Teroro gazed back at her dark eyes and for a moment was inspired to leap to his feet and join her in the dance ; but he felt that he must ignore Havaiki women , since he would one day destroy this evil place . He felt no burning sexual desire , for on Bora Bora he had always been allowed almost any girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been handed over to an older woman who had instructed him long and intimately in the proper behavior of men and what pleases women , and it was this preceptor who had selected his first four partners . Later , after long consultations with a genealogist , the instructress had decided that moon-faced Marama was the girl he must marry . " She will fit you appropriately in all ways , " the older woman had decided , and she was right . His subsequent girls Teroro had picked for himself , andsex had been as natural to him as swimming , so that now he was constrained to ignore the dancing girl before him , except that when he saw the look of intense disappointment on her face he felt ashamed , and against his better judgment , looked at her and smiled . And in that instant he saw her framed against palm trees , with long black tresses glistening in the fires , and on some surging impulse he leaped to his feet , whirled into the dancing area and positioned himself before her , swinging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bora Bora hula . Now the beautiful young girl acted as if she had never seen her new partner before . Dancing impersonally , her eyes far away , she led the drums to faster rhythms until in mounting fire her entire body quivered and a soft glow of perspiration reflected from every angle of her golden brown skin . She bent her knees and danced close to the ground . Then , in the most characteristic passage of the Havaiki hula , she spread her knees as if entertaining a man in love , whereupon the drums retarded their beat to allow her movements to become slow and madly provocative . She closed her dark eyes and held her head far back . With one hand she caught the ends of her hair and passed them between her teeth . Over her a savagely aroused Teroro danced until with a fiery leap he sprang high into the air , descending with his toes not inches front hers . He now bent his body , spreading his knees , and for at least a minute the two bronzed bodies swayed until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums rose to new violence and the dancers entered upon the final wild gyrations . Then , magically , everything stopped . There was dead silence , and the young girl , walking slowly like a sea goddess come ashore , moved demurelytoward the shadows that marked the sleeping areas of the compound . When she had vanished , Teroro with maximum indifference stooped to throw a driftwood brand into the fire . Then tardily , like a boy summoned to a temple , he started edging toward the shadows , but this was too much for one of the chief 's women , and she called in a wild , penetrating voice , " Take your skirt off , Tehani , I ca n't make you an-other . " He found her waiting for him in the far corner of the compound , before a small house which her family had reserved for her on her thirteenthbirthday , for island parents encouraged their daughters to experiment with many young men and to learn the ways of love , since potential husbands did not like to marry any girl who had not already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house , " she said simply . " What is your name ? " " I am Tehani , Chief Tatai 's daughter . " " Tehani , " Teroro interpreted . " The little darling . " The girl laughed nervously and replied , " My mother was beautiful . " With a swift passage of his arm about her hair-hidden waist , Teroro swept Tehani into the air and carried her into her house . Happily , shetwisted her long tresses about his face and pressed her lips to his . When he had placed her on the soft pandanus mats she pulled away her skirt of ti leaves and said , " It was my mother who warned me not to tear the skirt . " And she pulled Teroro onto her and wrapped her arms about him , twisted and sought him , pressing him ever more strongly to her . But later , as he lay in the starlight that drifted in through the doorway , he swore to himself : " I will destroy this compound . . . this whole island . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's house , where his adventure with Tehani occasioned no comment , he returned to the girl 's secluded house , and after a while the two lovers began idly toying with the famous Havaiki slapping game , wherein to an ancient chant each gently tapped the other 's finger tips , then shoulders , then sides , then thighs ; as the game progressed the slaps grew in intensity , until perversely they dropped away to the tenderest of caresses , so that a gesture which started as a quick slap might end as a long embrace . At last Tehani lingered so gently over one slap , that Teroro caught her skirt and pulled it from her . Completely naked , she continued the game , chanting a few haphazard bars and attempting a few more desultory slaps , now grown breathless and passionate , until with a cry of soft triumph she surrenderedthe game and rolled into Teroro 's arms , pushing him back onto the matting . Later she whispered , " This is the way we fight on Havaiki . " When Teroro laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their men like this ? " Teroro was not pleased with the question , and although Tehanisensed his irritation she nevertheless pursued : " Is it true that on tiny Bora Bora you still pray to Tane ? " The manner in which she pronouncedtiny and Tane betrayed the contempt with which people of her island had always regarded Bora Bora . Teroro did not rise to the insult . With studied courtesy he said , " We pray to Oro , which is why , even though we are so small , we invariably defeat Havaiki in war . " Tehani blushed at the memory of her island 's humiliations and asked , " Did you wonder why my father came for you last night ? And why I danced for you ? " " I thought about it . It looked planned . " " And why I brought you here ? " " At first love-making a man sometimes wonders , " Teroro said . " At the second he no longer bothers . " " And at the third , " Tehani whispered , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make his home here . . . to become a man of Havaiki . " Teroro pulled away and said , " For a warrior there is only one home , Bora Bora . " It was an ancient island custom that high-born women could seek their husbands , and Tehani now did so . " I plead with you , Teroro . Stay here with me . " " If you want to be my wife , " he said , " you 'll have to come to my island . " " You already have a first wife there , Teroro . Live here , and I will be your first wife . " The young chief held the girl off and studied her marvelous face . " Why do you ask this , Tehani ? You could have any man on Havaiki . " The girl hesitated , then decided to speak the truth . " Your island is doomed , Teroro . You must escape . Come here . Be loyal to Oro . We can have a good life . " " Has your father suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he planning ? " " I dare not say , " she answered . Taking Teroro 's hands , she knelt before him and pleaded softly , " I have shown you how sweet Havaiki could be because I want to save your life . Here you can become a powerful chief . My father has many lands , and Oro is generous to warriors like you . " " I belong to Bora Bora , " Teroro said with passionate conviction . " I will never leave that island , " and he started for the canoe , but pleading Tehani caught him by the legs , and he stayed with her that second night , so that on the next morning when the conch shells told of departure , he was reluctant to go . " There are no women like you on Bora Bora , " he confessed . " Stay here with me , " she pleaded . At this moment he was almost tempted into confiding to her the revengehe had been formulating in his mind , but he fought back the impulseand said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would be my woman . A man could enjoy you . " " Come soon , Teroro , for Bora Bora is doomed . " Certainly , when the eleven visiting canoes departed the temple and stood out to sea , each breaking off from the column for its own destination , it seemed that the days of Bora Bora 's greatness had vanished , for it was a dispirited group that occupied Wait-for-the-West-Wind . King Tamatoa acknowledged that in the game of power at the temple , he had permanently lost . All strength now lay with the High Priest , and abandonmentof the island to Oro was the only sensible course . Teroro , surveyinghis depleted ranks , brooded on revenge , but had to recognize that the priest had outwitted him and had stricken down enough of his men to demoralize the rest . The crewmen sensed that their chiefs were disorganizedand that ultimate power now lay with the High Priest , but they did not know by what political contrivances the power would be transferred ; while the junior priests were so excited by the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havaiki , to assassinateboth Tamatoa and Teroro and thus to settle the island 's problems once and for all . HAWAII 50 From the Sun-Swept LagoonTo their surprise , the High Priest had not assented to this ; in fact , he had condemned his overeager assistants and had reasoned : " If we disposeof the king and his brother in this manner , the people will lament their passing and might even rise against us , but if we continue as we have been doing , then the people themselves will discover that their king is powerless against the wishes of Oro , and they will either force him to Oro 's will , or they will desert him . " " But what if the king is obstinate ? " an old priest had asked , recalling the record of Tamatoa 's father , against whom Havaiki , Tahiti and Moorea had united in war , fruitlessly . The High Priest had looked up at the sacrifices dangling in the moonlight and had observed : " Tamatoa may remain obstinate , but his people wo n't . Have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where is Teroro , their leader , right now ? Idling in the hut of Tehani ! " The old priest , not certain that Tamatoa would abdicate , had argued : " Whom shall we select to rule Bora Bora if we do depose the king ? " The High Priest had hoped that this question would not be raised , because he did not wish to stand forth among his followers as the originatorof a plan that had indeed been devised by the generality of priests , so he had equivocated and said , " Oro has chosen a successor . " " Who ? " the old man had pressed . " Oro has chosen Tehani 's father , the great chief Tatai . " There had been a long silence as the enormity of this decision struck the priests , for they were Bora Bora bred , and what was proposed was nothing less than the submission of their island to the ruling house of Havaiki , a thing never accomplished in the past by siege or war or contrivance . The High Priest had known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone could speak , he had added , " It is Oro who has chosen Tatai . " The invocation of Oro 's name among men who had only recently staked their lives on this god , effectively halted comment , and the High Priest had continued : " That is why Tatai has urged his daughter Tehani to become the wife of Teroro . He will move to Havaiki and take with him most of his vigorous supporters , and they will soon become swallowedup among the men of Havaiki . Tatai , when he becomes king of Bora Bora , has agreed to leave his wives behind and to marry our women . In this way , Oro will be supreme . " He had not added that when this was accomplished , he hoped to move his own headquarters to the great temple at Havaiki , and that at such time he would take along with him those Bora Bora subordinates who most heartily supported his master plan . But none of his listeners required to be told this , and with these exciting thoughts coursing through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surviving crewmen had few coherent thoughts . Theyhad watched , helpless , while their original number was decimated by the power of Oro , and they had shared their leaders ' confusion . Contrary to what the High Priest believed , they were gratified rather than disturbed by the fact that Teroro had spent his time with Tehani , for Mato had spread the news that Teroro must be got back to Bora Bora alive . They suspected that King Tamatoa had some solid plan of revenge , and they hoped to be a part of it . But beyond animal revenge they could not see . There was one emotion which all in the boat shared , for at the end of the day , just before entering the home lagoon , the travelers saw the sun sink toward the west , throwing rich golden lights upon their magic island , and each man , no matter what his plots , instinctively felt : " This is the beautiful island . This is the land upon which the gods have spent particular care . " For to see Bora Bora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peaks , with dark night drifting in upon the valleys , and with sea birds winging homeward ; to see the red line of sunset climbing the mountain faces until the top was reached , and darkness , and to cry , " Hold ! Hold ! Let it remain day until I touch the shore ! " and to catch within the lagoonthe sounds of children at play and the echoes of home , while outside the reef the ocean roared  --  to have known Bora Bora at such a moment was to have known beauty . It was with enhanced regret , therefore , that King Tamatoa led his brother to the palace and bade him recline on the pandanus mats , whereupon the king carefully lowered the matting walls , and when he was thus protected from spies , lay down facing Teroro . Secretly and in a low voice he delivered the striking words : " I have decided that we must leave Bora Bora . " Teroro was stunned . He had never even contemplated such a retreat , for he still did not appreciate the untenable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why should we leave ? " he gasped . " There is no place for us here any longer . " " We can fight ! We can kill . . . " " Whom shall we fight ? The people ? The other islands ? " " We could . . . " " We can do nothing , Teroro . " " But where can we go ? " " To the north . " This simple phrase carried implications that were difficult for Teroro to digest , and as the idea climbed from one level of his consciousness to another he could only repeat his brother 's startling words . " To the north ? " He recalled that other canoes had left for the north centuries before , legendary canoes which had never returned . There existed , however , a mysterious old chant which purported to give sailing directions to a distant land that lay under the Seven Little Eyes , the holy constellaHAWAII 52 11 53 Fromthe Sun-Swept Lagoontion whose rising launched the new year , and some said that this chant implied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and words from the chant came to his mind : Sail to the Seven Little Eyes , To the land guarded by Little Eyes . But as soon as he spoke the words he grew angry , for they conjured up a picture of him fleeing Bora Bora . " Why should we go ? " he blustered . " Do n't take refuge in empty words , Teroro , " the king snapped im- patiently . " When you sailed to Nuku Hiva , did you find any certain knowledge of any of the canoes that have sailed to the north ? " " No. , , " I understand there 's an old sailing chant . " " No one knows for sure where it came from . " " What does it say ? " " If I remember , it says to sail until you come to land that lies under the Seven Little Eyes . " " How many days ? " " Some men say thirty , some say fifty . " " Teroro , if we decided to sail with the next big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people could we carry on our canoe ? " " Would they let us take Wait-for-the-West-Wind ? " " If not , we would have to fight for it . " " Good ! " Teroro grunted , for now he could begin to see specific action . " How many men ? " Tamatoa pressed . " About sixty . " " And all supplies ? " " Everything . " " And a house for our gods ? " " Yes . " The brothers lay on the matting with their faces at arm 's length apart , whispering , and finally Tamatoa asked , " Who should join us ? " Teroro quickly rattled off the names of many warriors : " Hiro , Mato , Pa . . " We are n't going to battle , " Tamatoa corrected . " We are going to the north . . . forever . " In the hushed room the word overcame Teroro . " Leave Bora Bora forever ? " He leaped to his feet and cried , " We 'll kill the High Priest tonight ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the matting . " We are concerned with a great voyage , not revenge . " But Teroro cried , " At the convocation I and my men were ready to fight all the islands if anyone touched you , Tamatoa . We would have strewn the temple with bodies . We feel the same way now . " Tamatoa smiled and said , " But the High Priest outsmarted you , did n't he ? " Teroro pressed his fingers into a tight knot and mumbled , " How did it happen ? Our plan was so good . " " Oro has triumphed , " the king said sadly . " We had better take our gods and go . " Teroro growled , " I should like to be set free on Havaiki one night beforewe go . They 'd never put out the fires . " " Is there anyone on Bora Bora who knows the directions north ? " " Our uncle . It was Tupuna who taught them to me . " " Is he loyal to Oro ? " Tamatoa asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Impossible , " Tamatoa objected . " For wise old men like Tupuna , many things are possible , " Teroro laughed . " Do you want me to call him ? " " Wait . Wo n't he be in session with the others ? " " They do n't pay much attention to him , " Teroro explained . " They suspect lie 's loyal to you . " " We would n't dare take so long a voyage without a priest , " Tamatoa said gravely . " To be alone on the ocean for fifty days . . . " " I would want a priest along , " Teroro agreed . " Who would read the omens ? " And he sent a messenger to fetch old Tupuna . In the interim the brothers resumed their positions and their planning . " Can we gather all we need ? " the king asked . " We can get spears and helmets . . . " " Brother ! " Tamatoa cried impatiently . " For the last time , we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you get breadfruit shoots that will survive ? Seed coconuts ? Bred sows ? And some good eating dogs ? We would need a thousand fishhooks and two thousand lengths of sennit . Can you get those things ? " " I 'll get them , " Teroro said . " Keep thinking about whom we shall take with us . " Again Teroro rattled off the easy names and again the king interrupted : " Find a man who can make knives , one who can strip pandanus , a good fishhook man . " " Well , if we take sixty men it ought to be easy . . . " " I 've been counting the spaces in my mind , " Tamatoa reflected . " We can take only thirty-seven men , six slaves , and fifteen women . " " Women , " Teroro gasped . " Suppose the land to the north is empty , " Tamatoa mused . " Suppose there are no women . We would watch our friends set their feet upon the rainbow , one by one , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no children . " " Will you take a wife ? " Teroro asked . " I will take none of my present wives , " the king replied . " I 'll tak atabu , so that we can have royal children . " EIAWAII 54 55 From the Sun-Swept Lagoon " I 'll take Marama . " The king hesitated , then took his brother by the hands . " Marama may not go , " he said gravely . " We will take only women who can bear children . " " I would not want to go without Marama , " the younger man said . " She is my wisdom . " " I am sorry , brother , " the king said with complete finality . " Only women who can bear children . " " Then I wo n't go , " Teroro said flatly . " I need you , " the king replied . " Do n't you know any young girl to take ? " Before Teroro could reply , the flaps parted and his uncle , old Tupuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the palace . He was nearly seventy , a remarkable age in the islands , where a man of thirty-three like the king was already an elder , so he spoke with exceptional authority . " I come to my brother 's sons , " he said gravely , taking a seat on the matting near them . " 1 come to my own children . " The king studied the old man carefully , and then said in a low voice , " Uncle , we place our safety in your hands . " In a striking voice mellowed by years and wisdom Tupuna said , " You 're planning to leave Bora Bora and want me to join you . " The brothers gasped and looked about lest any spies should have lingered , but the old man reassured them . " All the priests know you 're planning to leave , " he said benevolently . " We 've just been discussing it . " " But we did n't know ourselves until we entered this room an hour ago , " Teroro protested . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out . " Will you join us ? " Tamatoa asked directly . " Yes . I told the priests I was loyal to Oro , but I could not let my family depart without an intercessor with the gods . " " We could n't go without you , " Teroro said . " Will they let us take Wait-for-the-West-Wind ? " the king asked . " Yes , " the old man replied . " I pleaded for that in particular , because when I was younger I helped consecrate the trees that built this canoe . I shall be happy to have it my grave . " " Your grave ? " Teroro asked . " I expect to reach land ! Somewhere ! " " All men who set forth in canoes expect to reach land , " the old man laughed indulgently . " But of all who leave , none ever return . " " Teroro just told me that you knew sailing directions , " the king protested . " Somebody must have returned . " " There are sailing directions , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from ? Are they a dream ? They tell us only to sail to land guarded by the Seven Little Eyes . Perhaps the chant refers only to the dream of all men that there must be a better land somewhere . " " Then we know nothing about this journey ? " Tamatoa interrupted . " Nothing , " Tupuna replied . Then he corrected himself . " We do know one thing . It 's better than staying here . " There was silence , and then Teroro surprised the king by asking , " Have they agreed to let us take our gods , Tane and Ta'aroa ? " " Yes , " the old man said . " I am glad , " Teroro said . " When a man gets right down to the ocean 's edge . . . when he is really starting on a voyage like this . . . " He did not finish , but Tupuna spoke for him . He said , in a deep propheticvoice , " Are there people where we go ? No one knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find coconuts and taro and breadfruitand fat pigs ? Will we even find land ? All that we know , sons of my brother , sons of my heart , is that if we are in the hands of the gods , even if we perish on the great ocean , we will not die unnoticed . " " And we know one thing more , " the king added . " If we stay here we shall slowly , one by one , be sacrificed , and all our family and all our friends . Oro has ordained it . He has triumphed . " " May I tell the High Priest that ? It will make our departure easier . " In complete humbleness of spirit , King Tamatoa replied , " You may tell him . " At this moment there came from the beach a sound which thrilled the three plotters , converting them at once from mature men into the childrenthat they essentially were ; and as each heard the exciting message , his eyes widened with joy and he threw off whatever badges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace door , looking out into the starry darkness with the same pulsating thrill he had known as a boy . For there along the waterfront , in the midnight hour , the citizens of Bora Bora , without king or priest , had assembled with drums and nose flutes for a night of wild merriment . The apprehensions of the convocationwere ended and childish revelry was again in command . Therefore , with only the rank of commoners , Tamatoa , Tupuna and Teroro hurried eagerly to the beach . A raucous old woman was yelling , as they carne , " Let me show you how our great helmsman Hiro steers a canoe ! " And in superb mimicry she became not an old woman with few teeth , but a malicious lampoon of young Hiro steering his canoe ; in a dozen ways she caught his mannerisms : the way he looked out to sea , and his swagger ; but what she steered was not the canoe 's tiller but the makebelievemale genitals of another old woman who was playing the part of the canoe . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's very smart , Hiro ! " The crowd bellowed , particularly when they saw Teroro applauding the vicious mimicry of his helmsman . " I 'll bet she really could steer a canoe ! " he shouted . " You 'd be surprised at what I could do ! " the lascivious old womanHAWAII 56 57 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonreplied . But the crowd left her antics and started to applaud as blunt Malo , from the other side of the island , suddenly wrapped a bit of yellow tapa about his shoulders and made believe he was fat Tatai of Havaiki , executing ridiculous steps to the music and lampooning that chief 's pompous ways . To the great joy of the assembly , King Tamatoa nimbly leaped into the smoky arena and took his place beside Malo , and both imitated Tatai , each more foolishly than his competitor , until at last it was difficult to say which was Malo and which the king . The foolish little dance ended with Tamatoa sitting exhausted in the dust , laughing madly as if he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for shark-faced Pa had grabbed a leaf-skirt and was crying in a shrill high voice , " Call me Tehani ! " And he pirouetted grotesquely but with uncanny skill , evoking the Havaiki girl , until Teroro asked himself , " How could he have seen her dance ? " But his preoccupation with Pa was broken when he saw his own wife , Marama , leap into the dance in hilarious burlesque of her husband . " It 's Teroro ! " the crowd applauded as the skilled woman ridiculed her man , gently and with love , but also with keenest perception . As she danced Teroro wondered : " Who told her about Tehani ? " Marama and the shark-faced man were the night 's success . Pa was so ugly and his features so preposterous that he could make them seem like those of any man ; and he could be both gentle , as in his mimicry of Tehani , and savage , as in his next burlesque of the High Priest . With a bit of black tapa for a wig and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demented manner , whirling about and pointing his stick at first one islander and then another . As he did so , Marama , dancing behind with a feather bag , played the burly executioner , clubbingdown one victim after another . Finally , in mock frenzy , the crazy dancer Pa gyrated directly up to King Tamatoa and pointed his stick at him , whereupon Marama rushed along , swung her feather bag , and brought it within an inch of the king 's face . The victim fell as if his skull had been crushed , and lay in the sand , laughing , laughing . As the long wild night progressed , every item of island life was brought under ridicule , with chinless Pa as the ringleader . He possessed what islanders loved : a child 's sense of fairy tale , and to watch his amazing pointed face move from one characterization to the next was endless joy . Toward dawn , when the fears and repressions of the past weeks were dissipated , a group of old women approached King Tamatoa and began pleading with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until at last he gave assent , whereupon the delegation 's leader leaped withered-legged into the center of the crowd , screaming the good news : " Our great king says tonight we play the gourd game ! " With hushed excitement the men and women separated into facing groups as King Tamatoa ceremoniously tossed toward the men a feathered gourd which glistened in the firelight . A chief reached out and caught it , danced a few ritual steps , then pitched it in a high , shimmering arc towardthe eager women . A young girl who had long lusted after this man leaped into the air , snatched the gourd and dashed with it to the man who had thrown it . Clutching him by the waist , she rushed him passionately into the shadows , while the feathered gourd flew back and forth , determining the sleeping partners for that wild night . Teroro , although he had the island to choose from , elected his own wife , Marama , the penetrating clown , and as they lay quietly in the grayand-silverdawn , with the timeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud revelry , Teroro confided , " Tamatoa has decided to leave the islands . " " I suspected he had reached some grave decision , " Marama said . " He was so eager to laugh . " " What I do n't understand is , the High Priest has agreed to let Tupunajoin us . And also to let us take Wait-for-the-West-Wind . " Marama explained : " He 's wise . He knows that islanders like to avoid direct conflicts that humiliate others . It 's good procedure . " Her words were so in conflict with his plans for revenge that he asked , " What about the humiliation we suffered at Havaiki ? Would you forget that , too ? " " I would , " she said firmly . " When we 're safe on some other island we can afford to forget Havaiki . " He started to explain that she would not be going on the voyage , but he could find no words to do so gracefully ; in cowardice he fell asleep , but after a while he half-woke and mumbled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really wonderful . " W HEN THE DECISION to depart from Bora Bora was whisperedfrom one village to the next , the island became a curious place , because no one admitted officially that the king was leaving . The High Priest continued to pay public deference to Tamatoa , and old Tupuna officiated at daily prayers to Oro . Young chiefs who had determined to join the expedition embraced wives who were obviouslygoing to be left behind ; but under this surface of indifference , all were preoccupied with one job : loading a canoe for an unknown voyage . Particular care was given to food supplies . It was relatively easy to prepare food that was to be consumed on the voyage ; it was dried in the sun and compacted into small bundles tied with ti leaves . What required special thought was the selection of roots and saplings for a new land . Experts sought taro roots that would produce the gray-blue tuber which made the best poi , and coconuts that came from the strongest trees , and breadfruit that did not grow too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glutinous sap . White-haired Tupuna spent three days selecting chickens that would yield meat and dogs that would bake well , HAWAII 58 59 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonfor he constantly reminded his charges that they were heading for land that might be very spare , indeed . Then came the day when departure could no longer be politely masked , for with a saw made from a large sea shell , Teroro boldly cut eleven feet from each of the canoe 's high sterns . " We can not risk such high adornment on a long trip , " he explained . " Auwe ! " cried men and women along the shore . " The great canoe of Bora Bora is being desecrated . " Gently Teroro handed down the god- carved sterns , and priests bore them to the temple . The crowd watched while he used dried shark 's skin to smooth the ends of the truncated stern , and he kept his back to the watchers as he worked , for he was praying , " Wait-for-the-West-Wind , forgive me for this mutilation , " and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe , an obsessive rage was generated which was to make his departure from Bora Bora an event ever to be remembered in the islands . His rage increased when he left his deformed canoe and went to his own hut , where he threw himself on the floor and hammered the pan- danus mats . Marama came to sit with him and assured him : " When we have found a new home we will find big trees and we can make new pillars for our canoe . " " No ! They 'll remain as they are ! A signal of our shame . " " You talk like a boy , " the placid-faced woman chided . " When I was a boy , " he corrected , " if anyone insulted me , I beat him on the head . But now I 'm a man , and Havaiki insults me without risks . " " Teroro , " his wife pleaded . " Look at it sensibly . What has Havaiki really done ? They 've invented a new god , and the world seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teroro grasped his wife by the arm . " Have n't you heard the whis- pers ? " he asked bitterly . " When Tamatoa goes , who is to be the new king ? Fat Tatai of Havaiki . " Marama gasped . " Have they gone so far ? " she asked . " Yes ! " Teroro snapped . " And do you know what they had the inso- lence to do ? They proposed that I desert my brother and leave Bora Bora . I was to marry Tatars daughter . . . trade places with him ! " " Why did n't you tell me this ? " " It was only now that I figured it out , " he replied sheepishly . And as always , when he felt humiliated , he decided upon a plan of swift action . " Marama , " he said hurriedly , " go across the mountain and assemble all who have agreed to paddle the canoe . " " What are you planning ? " she asked suspiciously . " To take West Wind for a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern works . Tell anyone who asks , that 's what we 're doing . But whisper to each man that he must also bring his best war club . " " No , Teroro ! " " Do you want us to creep away , unavenged ? " " Yes . There 's no dishonor in that . " " Not for a woman , perhaps , " Teroro said . Marama considered what was involved , the possibility of death and the chance that Havaiki might send canoes in retaliation , thus ending escape to the north , but after she had considered for a long time she said , " Since men are what they are , Teroro , you ought not to go unavenged . May the gods protect you . " So , toward midafternoon two days before the intended departure for Nuku Hiva , and while a good wind blew from the west , promising a later storm of some dimensions , thirty determined paddlers , plus the steersmanHiro and the navigator Teroro , set forth from Bora Bora to test their canoe . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stoutly into the dark waters of the outer ocean , already whipped by the wind into sturdy waves . The canoe moved back and forth in speed tests , then hoisted sail and darted into a long leg down wind . When it had left the lee of the island Teroro asked , " Are we agreed ? " " We are , " Mato said , pulling his war club into position . " To Havaiki ! " Teroro shouted to the steersman , and West Wind tore into the waves and its paddlers strained as darkness fell over the impartialsea . For generations out of mind Bora Bora had been known among the islands as the land of the muffled paddles , for since it was the smallest of the major islands , its men were required to practice added caution . Now , with the dying moon not yet risen , they paused to wrap their paddle handles in tapa , so that they could creep silently , leaving barely a ripple on the sea , toward the hallowed landing of Oro , where only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gently , the double canoe was beached before any outlook spotted it , and thirty resolute men , leaving two to guard the canoe , slipped into the night toward the village where fat Tatai , the intended king of Bora Bora , slept . The avengers had almost reached the village when a dog barked , causing a woman to cry , " Who 's stealing breadfruit ? " She sounded an alarm , but before effective action could be taken , Teroro and his men had fallen upon the village and were seeking out all who had insulted them , and most particularly fat Tatai , the nominatedking . It was Teroro who led the avengers to Tatars compound . There he and shark-faced Pa swept into the main hut , smashing and crashing all they encountered . A girl 's voice , soft and petulant , whispered , " He is not here , Teroro ! " Then she screamed in pain , for Pa 's great club struck her , and from the floor she whimpered , " He is not here . " Pa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with his left hand dragged her to safety . From a flare set ablaze by the frugal woman who was determined to protect her breadfruit , Teroro saw that Tehani was naked except for a hastily grabbed skirt which she heldH A W A I I 60 61 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonbefore her , and he rediscovered her spectacular beauty . From a distance came his brother 's voice : " Do n't you know any young girl ? " and on the impulse of the moment he brought Tehani 's face to his and rasped , " Will you go north with me ? " " Yes . " " Are you hurt ? " " My shoulder . " " Broken ? " " No . " " Wait for me at the canoe . " He thrust her toward the shore and then caught her again , muttering , " We have come to kill your father . Do you still want to go ? " " I 'll wait at the canoe , " she said . Now he heard Mato shout , " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teroro pleaded , swinging his club , but when he reached the prostrate figure of Tatai he saw that Pa had already killed him . Grabbing a handful of thatch from a roof he spread it about the dead man 's head . " The new king of Bora Bora ! " he cried derisively . " To the canoe ! " the steersman shouted . " Not before we destroy this place ! " Teroro cried , and grabbing from the woman 's hand the brand by which she was inspecting her breadfruit , he swept it along the thatch of a nearby house ; the rising wind ripped the flames along , and soon the sacred channel of Oro and the environs of his temple were ablaze . In this light , the men of Bora Bora retreated . At the canoe a battle raged , only prompt reinforcement saved the craft , for one of the guardians was already dead and the other was badly wounded . As the Bora Borans drove back the attackers and leaped into the truncated canoe , Tehani ran from a clump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Traitor ! " the defeated Havaiki warriors cried , already inventing an explanation that would excuse their defeat . They launched their spears and in their frustration would have killed her , except that Teroro left the canoe , leaped into the surf , and ran back to rescue her . " We are in danger ! " the steersman warned , standing the canoe out into the channel . But Teroro continued running until he intercepted the girl and swept her into his arms . Then , dodging shears , he dashed for the beach and into the surf . He might not have made the canoe , except that Mato dived into the channel and took the girl , whose shoulder was so damaged that she could not swim . Together they lifted her into the canoe and set their course for Bora Bora , but before they had left the shadow of Havaiki , Teroro said to the girl , " We found your father . " She replied , " I know . " The return trip was one of intense excitement , marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the just punishmentof a stranger who had presumed to rule Bora Bora . And there was the ironic joy of knowing that before Havaiki could retaliate  --  if indeed they ever dared try  --  all involved would be on the open sea , far from Bora Bora . But above all , there was great animal joy in realizing that during the strike at Havaiki , the promised storm had actually formed and that it now blew with real force , for although the unexpected strength of the westerly made the journey back to Bora Bora difficult , it also meant that the one essential requirement for a long journey to the north was at hand . " This storm will blow for days ! " Teroro assured his men . At daybreak it became possible to turn and run before the wind safely into the lagoon , and as they reached its protection Teroro drilled his men in the story they must tell : " We took West Wind for a trial . The storm came up . We saw we could n't get back . So we laid over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence and added , " In this storm no one from Havaiki would dare come here with the true story . " " What about the girl ? " Pa asked . Everyone looked at Tehani , huddling wet in the hull , and it was immediatelyapparent. especially to Tehani , that the simplest solution to the difficulty she presented would be to knock her on the head and throw her into the storm . Pa was ready to do this , but Teroro stopped him . " She 's my girl , " he said bluntly . " We 'll take her to my house . " " She 'll betray us . " " She wo n't . We 'll say that while we were in the channel I went ashore to get her for the journey north . " " Do you intend taking her ? " Mato asked . " Yes . She 's my girl . " " What about your wife Marama ? " " She ca n't bear children . She ca n't go . " " This one will betray us ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled Tehani to her feet . Thrusting his face into hers he said , " Until we leave Bora Bora you will speak to no one about this night . No one . " " I understand , " she said , sinking back into the canoe . " It is you I will take north , " Teroro promised her . As the canoe neared shore , Mato cried , " What a storm ! We went all the way to Havaiki . " Of all the listeners , only Marama knew the full significance of this statement : that some great revenge had been carried out . Swiftly she counted the canoe and saw that the young chief Tami had been lost . " Where is Tami ? " she called . " He was lost reefing sail in the storm , " Pa lied . A man called , " Why did you go all the way to Havaiki ? " Pa answered , " Teroro went to fetch the girl he will take north with him . " HAWAII 62 63 From the Sun-Swept LagoonFrom the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tehani slowly rose , and it was in this way , with the west wind of the storm beating in her face , that Marama learned she would not be accompanying Teroro to the north . No sound escaped her lips . She stood in the wind with both hands pressed against her sides , her hair whipping about her shoulders , her great placid face , handsome as a moon on the thirteenth night , staring at the stranger in the canoe . She thought : " A man is dead . Some dreadful event has occurred that will contaminate the islands for years . Brave stupid men like my husbandhave gained their revenge , for what it matters . And a young stranger takes my place in the canoe . " Patiently she studied the newcoinerand thought : " She is beautiful and her body is well formed . Perhapsshe can have children . Perhaps it 's better . " But then she looked at Feroro , and her heart broke . Hiding her tears she turned to go home , but her degradation was not completed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the canoe and he said , " Take Tehani home , " and Marama reached down and took the girl 's hand and led her home . In its second night the storm rose to an intensity that quite precluded any departure on the day planned , and as the winds howled , those responsiblefor the voyage had a few last hours free for dreaming . The visions of Teroro were agitated , and toward dawn he saw two women standing by West Wind , and the canoe had no mast on which to hang its sail . He awoke in fright , shook his head vigorously , and realized that the two women were merely Marama and Tehani and their standing by the canoe signified only that each wanted to go north with him , so he wakened Marama , explaining , " The king will allow only one woman to go , Marama , and he insisted that I take a younger . " " I understand , " she said dully . " It is n't that I 've grown tired of you , " he whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You understand how it is ? " he pleaded . " I understand that I have given you no children . " " You 've been a good wife , Marama , but the king . . . " He fell asleep , but before the birds had wakened , he dreamed again and saw his canoe with no mast , and this time the two women spoke , Marama in a deep voice crying , " I am Tane ! " and Tehani singing in a lilting voice , " I am Ta'aroa ! " Teroro woke trembling and cried , " Why should the gods speak to me on such a night ? " And for a long time he tried to decipher the dream , for he knew that before a voyage each dream meant something , but he could not find the key . So he rose in the gray light of dawn , while winds howled and drove rain across the island , and hurried , almost naked , to the hut of old Tupuna . " What did such a dream mean ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods ? " the bearded old man queried . " No , they were women 's voices , and yet Tane 's was deep as it should be , and Ta'aroa 's was high and piercing like his voice in a storm . " The old priest sat gathering his wisdom and listened to the roaring wind that must take them on their way . Finally he announced : " It is very clear , Teroro . Tane and Ta'aroa speak most forcefully when they speak in the wind . You must obey them . " " What do they want me to do ? " " There was no mast in your dream canoe , and no sail ? " " None . " " Then it 's simple . The gods wish you to take down your single mast and to raise instead two masts , one in each hull . " It was such an obvious explanation that Teroro laughed . " I 've seen canoes like that . One came to Nuku Hiva from the south . " " It 's natural , " Tupuna explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ta'aroa , who rules the sea , speak to a navigator in unison , they must be referring to the element that they rule together , the wind . They want you to erect two sails so that you can catch the wind better . " " I will do so , " Teroro said , and forthwith he called his men together , and even though departure could not be far off , he ripped down the mast , found a matching tree , and erected one in the right hull , which he named Tane , and the other in the left , which he called Ta'aroa . Then he lashed each with sennit shrouds , so that by nightfall a man could climb to the top of either and not tear it loose . It would have been unthinkablefor a navigator not to obey the gods . On the third night of the storm it was the king 's turn to dream , and he witnessed a fearful sight : two planets in the western sky at sunset , fighting with the sun and pushing it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other roamed north and south . This dream was so ominous that the king summoned his uncle immediately and lay facing him in dead of night , imploring counsel . " Does it mean that we are doomed ? " Tamatoa asked in distress . " Which of the wandering stars went searching east and west ? " Tupuna inquired . " The great star of evening . " " And they were both searching ? " " Like a dog combing the beach or a woman seeking a lost tapa . " " This is not a good omen , " Tupuna said gravely . " Could it mean . . . " the king began , but the concept was too forebodingto be put into words . " Failure ? " Tupuna asked bluntly . " You think it means that our canoe will wander north and south , east and west , until we perish ? " " Yes , " Tamatoa answered weakly . H A W A I I 64 65 From the Sun-Swept Lagoon " It can not mean that , " Tupuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Teroro last night , and he governs the canoe . " The king was not relieved , for he confided : " My other thought is just as bad . " " What is it ? " the old man asked . " I wonder if the two stars do not represent Tane and Ta'aroa , and the thing they are looking for is Oro . I wonder if they acknowledge Oro as supreme and do not want to go in our canoe unless he goes along ? " He dropped his head and muttered , " Uncle , I am sick with fear that we are doing something wrong . " " No , " Tupuna assured him , " I 've studied every omen . There is no indication of failure . Remember that Tane and Ta'aroa brought us significant advice , the need for two masts . Would they trifle with us ? " " But these searching stars ? " " I 'll confess , not a good omen .

" " You must unpack everything and then repack it , and when you have accomplished this , you will know what oversight has displeased the gods . " And so , on the third day of the storm , King Tamatoa did an unprecedentedthing : he threw open his tabu palace to the boat 's crew , and they assembled , on mats which the day before it would have been death to touch , each item that was to go north , and before the king 's careful eye they unwrapped and repacked their treasures . " Have we our tools ? " Tamatoa inquired , and his men brought forth the basalt stones used for cooking , and the sand . They produced bundles of sticks , some hard , some pithy , for making fire . Fishlines of sennit , fishhooksof pearl , nets and spears for sharks , all were in order . There were bluish-green adzes , stone chisels , pounders for crushing taro and others for making cloth . Some chiefs produced digging sticks , harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in planting taro . There were gourds and calabashes and cups for cooking . Men hauled in bows and arrows , and slingshots with pouches of special stones . There was a long pole with sticky gum for catching birds , a conch shell for calling to prayer , and four heavy stones to serve as sea anchors . The women who had been designated to go , proudly presented fine mats , tight in structure and waterproof . There were bailers to keep the canoe dry , paddles to speed it forward , and extra mats to use as sails . During the passage of a thousand years these wandering island people had , without the assistance of any metal or clay , perfected an intricate civilization and its tools . In one double canoe they were now ready to establish that culture on a distant island . The king was satisfied . " Have we cared for the plants and animals ? " he next inquired . Tenderly , the farmers from the group unwrapped the seed-things that would , in time , sustain life in new lands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until such time as they could be plunged into soft , wet mud for a new harvest . Banana shoots , on which the voyagers must depend for quick crops , were wrapped in damp leaves and kept cool , while choice coconuts , their eyes unopened , had to be kept dry lest they launch their shoots . Sugar cane , which all loved , had been cut into joints and was kept alive inside dark bundles made of leaves . " Where is the breadfruit ? " Tamatoa asked , and four men dragged onto the mat large bundles swathed in leaves and mud . These contained the breadfruit shoots , most delicate of the cargo , whose fruit was so loved by the islanders . When the shoots lay exposed , the king called for his uncle to bless them anew , and the group prayed for their safe transit . Men now hauled two squealing sows into the palace . " Have they been bred ? " the king asked . " To our best boar , " the men replied , hauling into the august presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch dogs and a male , two chickens and a rooster . " Have we feed for these animals ? " the king inquired , and he was shown bags of dried coconut , mashed sweet potatoes and dried fish . " Place these living things before me , and their food , " Tamatoa commanded , and when the assemblage was completed he cried in terrifying voice , " These are tabu ! These are tabu ! These are tabu ! " In solemn chant the witnesses repeated , " These are tabu ! " Then Tupunablessed them with long prayers of fertility , ending with his own warning : " These are tabu ! " It was not just a word that was being used ; it was a divine inhibition , and it signified that a man on this trip could see his woman die of starvation , but he could not hand her one morsel of the tabu food , nor eat any himself , for without this seed even those who did reach land would perish . Teroro now brought in the rations : breadfruit partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by baking and grating the untasty fruit , just barely palatable but useful on long trips ; dried sweet potatoes , shellfish , coconut meat , bonito hard as rock ; more than eighty drinking coconuts ; three dozen lengths of watertight bamboo filled with clear water . When the food was assembled all could see that it did not bulk large , and Tamatoa studied it with apprehension . " Have we enough ? " he asked . " Our people have been starving themselves for weeks , " Teroro replied . " We can live on nothing . " " And have they been drinking little ? " " Barely a cupful a day . " " Are your fishermen prepared to catch us extra food along the way ? " " They have prayed to Ta'aroa . There will be fish . " " Then let us bless this food , " Tamatoa said , and Tupuna recited the long chant which dedicated these rations to the gods . He hoped that the deities would allow his companions to eat the food while searching forHAWAII 66 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found , the gods would be rewarded with an endless supply of pigs . " Let us check the canoe , " the king said , and he led his subjects into the storm , where they went over each portion of Wait-for-the-West-Wind . The two hulls were not made from single hollowed-out trees , but were built up by butting together three separate sections , each about twentyfivefeet long . This meant that the canoe had to be tied together at the joints , and it was here that Bora Bora 's skill with sennit showed itself to greatest advantage , for the huge canoe was as rigid as if carved from a single log , yet it was composed of many pieces , lashed intricately together , and it was these joints that the king now inspected . They leaked , of course , and without constant bailing the canoe would sink , but they did not leak much . The strakes which formed the sides of the two hulls were also lashed on , and were also nearly watertight . The two halves of the canoe were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout beams that passed through the inside wall of each hull , and were again bound by powerful sennit , while to them was lashed the long , solid platformupon which the passengers and the gods would ride . This left , in each hull , a narrow space between the edge of the platform and the outer edge of the hull , where the paddlers sat on small movable seats which they shifted back and forth until they found a place amid the cargo where their feet could reach the bottom of the hull . " The canoe is fine , " Teroro assured his brother , and the crowd waited in silence while the two brothers and their uncle studied the storm . FinallyTamatoa said , " If the omens are good , we will leave tomorrow at dusk . We must be at sea when the stars rise . " When the others had gone , Tamatoa led Tupuna back to the palace and sat disconsolately upon the matting . " What have we overlooked ? " he fretted . " I saw nothing missing , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , Tupuna ? " " Nothing that is apparent . " " What does it mean ? " the king cried in deep perplexity . " I have tried so desperately to arrange this correctly . Where have I failed ? " His uncle said quietly , " I noticed that as we inspected the goods , when we were through , each man tied his bundles up a little more tightly . At the canoe they fastened the sennit just a bit more strongly . Perhaps that is what the gods wanted us not to forget . The last effort that insures success . " " You think it could have been that ? " Tamatoa asked eagerly . " It 's been a long day , " Tupuna evaded . " Let us all dream one more night , and if the omens are good , that must have been the meaning . " So on the fourth night of the storm all men who would make the voyageassembled at the temple according to ancient custom , there to acquire their last flow of mana and to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Once more Teroro dreamed of his canoe , and again Marama called that she was Tane and again Tehani was Ta'aroa , and just before he wakened , each woman was transformed into a mast , so that the omen was obviously hopeful . Teroro was so pleased that he risked a powerful tabu and crept out of the temple and went to the bed of Marama , lying with her for the last time and assuring her that it was only the king 's command that kept him from taking her , and in the last stormy darkness , she wept . He consoled her by taking from his pouch the length of sennit that he had picked up at the temple in Havaiki , and taking Marama out into the storm , he upturned a large rock and carefullyplaced the sennit under it . " When I have gone for a year , turn the rock aside and you 'll know whether I survived , " for if the sennit still lay clean and straight , the canoe had reached land ; but if it were twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat his matting with fists of joy , for incredible as it seemed , he had seen the Seven Little Eyes . He had seen them ! They had actually hung over Bora Bora and moved off with the canoe . " Oh , blessed Tane ! " the king cried in ecstasy . And for the rest of the night he did not sleep , but stood in the doorway of the temple surveying the storm , with the rain in his face , and in those solemn hours he knew an abiding content : " Our boat is well loaded . We have good men . My brother knows the sea and my uncle knows the chants . On this day we shall set forth . " But the dream that actually launched the voyage occurred in the hut of old Tupuna , for he saw in dream-spun heavens a rainbow standing directly in the path the canoe must take , and a worse omen than this there could not have been , but as he watched , Tane and Ta'aroa lifted the rainbow and placed it abaft the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The omen was so auspicious , evil changing to positive good by the action of gods , that the old man did not even wake to record his dream . In the morning he was suffused with delight and told the king , " Some wonderfully good thing took place last night . I forget what it was , but we will sail tonight . " He went directly to the altar and took down the final precious essentialsfor the journey : one stone was black and white with flecks of yellow , and round , the size of a fist  --  it was Tane ; the other stone was long and thin and greenish  --  it was Ta'aroa , god of the oceans on whom they must now depend . Tupuna wrapped each in a small cloth made of yellow feathers , and bearing his deities , he went to the canoe . In a small grass hut erected on the platform just abaft the masts , he placed Tane toward the right mast and Ta'aroa toward the left . The canoe could now be loaded . Aft of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tupunawould occupy during the entire voyage , tending the deities . Behind him was sleeping space for those members of the crew who were not paddling , and behind them a large grass hut for the twelve women who had been chosen to accompany the crew . Aft of them sat Natabu , silentHAWAII 68 59 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonand sacred , the wife of Tamatoa , accompanied by red-eyed Teura , the wife of Tupuna and seer of the voyage ; it was her duty to read omens . At the rear of the house , alone , sat Tamatoa beside a small doorway leading aft , from which he could watch the stars and check the steersman . The captaincy of the canoe lay with Teroro , who stood farthest forward with Tehani at his side ; but the actual life and death of this bold adventurerested with the king . Only he could say turn or stay . As the stormy day progressed it seemed inconceivable that any sensibleman would venture outside the reef , but all knew that only in such a westerly gale could a canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds kept strong , so did the hearts of the voyagers . They spent the day in prayer and in stowing the canoe . The slaves , the animals and the heavier bundles went into the left-hand hull , whose lead paddler would be Mato , upon whom the beat and rhythm would depend . Into the right-hand went the food , the trees and the extra mats . This would be headed by Pa . At the rear of this hull , cornerwise from Mato , the steersman Hiro would stand . The afternoon wore on and the crew said good-bye to wives they could not take , and to their children . Teroro went for the last time to see grave Marama in the little house where they had been so happy . She was dressed in her finest tapa , yards and yards of it about her handsome body , and her hair was marked with flowers . " Guide the canoe well , Teroro , " she said softly . " I shall pray for you . " " You will always be in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected . " When you are gone you must forget me . It would not be fair to Tehani . " " You are my wisdom , Marama , " he said sorrowfully . " When I see things clearly it is always because you showed me the way . I need you so much . " " Be quiet , Teroro , " she said , and as they sat on the matting for the last time she tried to share with him all the things she had forgotten to tell him . " Never go against the counsel of Mato . He sometimes seems stupid because he comes from the north side of the island , but trust him . If you get into a fight , rely on Pa . I like Pa . The man you prefer is Hiro . He 's fun , but can you trust him in an emergency ? Listen to your uncle Tupuna . His teeth are yellow with wisdom . And , Teroro , never again go on a journey of simple vengeance . " " Would you have had us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she admitted , " one can never defeat Havaiki enough . " She caught her breath and confided , " It would have been unbearable to have a Havaiki man for king . " Then she added quickly , " But mere revenge , especially when the king does not give consent . That must be past . " For the last time she talked with her man , and as the time came when he was forced to go she thought : " There is so much more he needs to know . " When he took his first step toward the door she fell on the mattingand kissed his ankles , and heard him say haltingly , " Marama , whenwe sail , please do n't come on shore . I could not bear it , " at which she rose full height and cried sharply , " Me ! Stay hidden indoors when my canoe is leaving ? It is my canoe . I am the spirit of the sails and the strength of the paddlers . I will take you to land , Teroro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men climbed aboard Wait-for-the-West-Wind , Marama , with her beautiful hair in the storm , guided them with her spirit and blessed them , and said to young Tehani , " Take care of our husband . Fill him with love . " But at the last minute she was thrust aside by a most unexpected arrival . It was the High Priest , come down to the launching with a long retinue of assistants , and he went to the canoe and cried , " Great Oro bids you safe journey ! " Grabbing hold of the bowsprit , he stepped aboard , clutching the mast Tane as he did so . Kneeling before the gods ' house , he pushed aside the grass door and deposited inside a sanctified statue of Oro , made of sacred sennit woven with his own hands and clothed in feathers . In haunting voice he cried into the storm , " Great Oro , bless this canoe ! " And as he stepped ashore , Teroro saw that a smile of enormous relief had come upon the face of his new wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas with strange gods , but now that Oro was with her , she knew the journey would succeed . And so the double canoe , Wait-for-the-West-Wind , loaded and creakingwith king and slave , with contradictory gods and pigs , with hope and fear , set forth upon the unknown . At the prow stood Teroro , ill-named the wise one , but at this fateful moment he was wise enough not to look back at Bora Bora , for that would have been not only an evil omen , but folly as well , for he would have seen Marama , and that sight he could not have borne . When West Wind reached the reef , and stood for a moment in its last stretch of easily navigable water , all in the canoe experienced a moment of awful dread , for outside the coral barrier roared the storm on slashing waves and tremendous deeps . Just for an instant Mato , lead paddle on the left , whispered , " Great Tane ! Such waves ! " But with prodigious force he led the paddlers into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm . The canoe rose high in the sea , teetered a moment with its shrouds whistling , then ripped down , down into the valley of the waves . Spray dashed across all heads and the two halves seemed as if they must tear apart . Pigs squealed in terror and dogs barked , while in the flooded grass house women thought : " This is death . " But instantly the powerful canoe cut into the waves , found itself , and rode high onto the crest of the ocean , away from Bora Bora of the muffledpaddles , away from the comforting lagoon and onto the highway that led to nothingness. 70 71 From the Sun-Swept LagoonI N SUCH WEATHER King Tamatoa led his people into exile . They did not go in triumph or with banners flying ; they fled at night , with no drums beating . They did not leave with riches and in panoply ; they were rudely elbowed off their island with only enough food to sustainthem precariously . Had they been more clever , they would have held their homeland ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had they perceived the deeper nature of gods , they would never have fallen prey to a savage deity who tormented them ; but they were stubborn rather than wise , and the false god expelled them . Later ages would depict these men as all-wise and heroic , great venturersseeking bright new lands ; but such myths would be in error , for no man leaves where he is and seeks a distant place unless he is in some respect a failure ; but having failed in one location and having been ejected , it is possible that in the next he will be a little wiser . There was , however , one overriding characteristic that marked these defeated people as they swept into the storm : they did have courage . Only if they had been craven could they have swallowed their humiliation and remained on Bora Bora ; this they would not do . It is true that they fled into the dusk , but each man carried as his most prized possession his own personal god of courage . For Teroro it was the mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Tamatoa it was the wind that spoke to him in tempests . For Tupuna it was the spirit of the lagoon that brought fish . And for his ancient bleary-eyed wife , Teura , the keeper of omens , it was a god so powerful that she scarcely dared mention its name . But it followed her in the ocean , her great and sweet and powerful deity , her courage in the unknown . When they had reached , more swiftly than ever before , a point off the north coast of Havaiki , Teroro crawled over to where Mato paddled and said , " I am going to speak with the king about our feeling . Promise me that you will support me . " " I promise , " Mato said . " Even if it means death ? " " Even then . " Precariously , Teroro made his way aft to consult with his brother , laying bare a wish that startled the king : " I can not sail with Oro in this canoe . Let us throw him into the ocean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . " Tamatoa summoned old Tupuna , who struggled aft with difficulty and sat with the brothers . " Teroro wants to throw Oro into the ocean , " Tamatoaexplained . The thought was even more repulsive to the old man than it had been to the king , and he warned in powerful voice that such a thing had neverbeen done . But Teroro was adamant : " We have suffered enough from Oro . My men can not sail this canoe with such a burden . " " If we were on land . . . " Tupuna protested . " No ! " the king said firmly . " It is impossible . " But Teroro would not surrender . He shouted forward for Mato , who soon appeared . Tamatoa was grave and said , " Teroro wants to throw the god Oro into the ocean . " " It must not be done ! " Tupuna warned . " Let Mato speak ! " Teroro demanded . " Teroro is right , " the stocky warrior said . " We have known only terrorfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he is a god ! " Tupuna protested . " We must not carry such poison to a new land , " Mato insisted . Tupuna warned : " If you do such a thing , the winds will tear this canoe apart . The ocean will open to its depth and swallow us . Seaweed will grow in our hair . " " I would rather be dead , " Mato shouted back , " than to install Oro in a new land . " At this point Teroro faced Tupuna and cried , " You say Oro will punishus ? I say this to Oro . " And he flung his head back , howling into the wind , " Oro , by your sacred pig , by your length of banana shoot , by the bodies of all men sacrificed to you , I condemn you and declare you nothing . I curse you and revile you and cast excrement in your face . Now strike me down . If you control the storm , raise your bloodstained hands and strike me down . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When nothing happened he fell to his knees and whispered , just loud enough for the others to hear , " But , gentle Tane , if you guide this canoe , and powerful Ta'aroa , if you control this storm , forgive me for what I have just said . Forgive me especially for what I am about to do . But I can not go forward with Oro as a passenger in this canoe . " He rose like a man in a dream , bowed low to his brother , and made dutiful obeisance to the priest . " Forgive me , " he said in a choking voice . " If in the next moment we are swept to death , forgive me . " He stumbled forward in the storm , but when he reached the gods ' house itself he was powerless to open the rain-sodden door . Inherited fear of gods , plus what he remembered of his early training when it was hoped he would become a priest , rendered him incapable of action and he returned to the rear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he confessed . " You are my king . " Tamatoa cried , " We shall be lost if we destroy a god . " Teroro fell on the platform and clutched his brother 's feet . " Commandme to destroy this evil thing . " " Do n't do it , Tamatoa ! " his uncle warned . In this moment of indecision , when the ultimate values of the canoe were laid open on the stormy deck , it was tough Mato who acted . HefHAWAII 72 73 F- ? the Sun-Swept Lagoonshouted , " King Tamatoa , if we take Oro with us , when you land you kill more people to show him gratitude , just in case it was he who brought us there . And once started , we will kill more , and more . You , Tupuna , you love gods , but we must save you from the temptation of growing to love this one ! " And he rushed to the gods ' house , uncovered the sennit-and-feather form of the avenging god and raised it high into the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he shouted . " We do n't want you . You 've eaten our men . You 've driven us from the home of our ancestors . Go away ! " And with a vast sweep of his arm , Mato threw the god far out to sea . But winds caught at the feathers and for an awful moment held the god aloft , so that it kept pace with the canoe . " Auwe ! " shrieked the priest . " Auwe ! See , Oro follows us ! " King Tamatoa , perceiving this miracle , fell to the platform in prayer , but Teroro , awakened from his indecision , grabbed a spear and with fury launched it at the god . It missed , but the shaft brushed the feathers and deflected the deity into the turbulent deep . Calmly , he turned to the prostrate king and said , " I have killed the god . You may do with me as you wish . " " Go to your post , " the king mumbled , stricken with fear . As Teroro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had helped diminish , he felt his craft sweep into the storm with new vigor ; the stays sang a sweeter song ; and he could see from their smiles that his men were assured . But when he passed the gods ' house and recalledhow powerless he had been at the vital moment , he looked across to where Mato sat , stubbornly paddling to keep the canoe right with the storm , and he wanted to clasp the man in brotherhood , but only Mato 's shoulders were free , and no man would dare touch another 's shoulders , for they were reserved for the personal god to perch on when he inspired a man with courage ; so Teroro merely whispered into the storm , " You were the brave one , Mato , " and the sturdy paddler replied , " The canoe feels lighter . " When Teroro recovered his post he found Tehani , the daughter of Oro , weeping . He knelt beside her and said , " You must try to forgive me , Tehani . I killed your father and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hands and swore : " I will never offend you again . " The dazzling girl , storm upon her face , looked up . She was bereft of the very foundations of her being , and although she tried to speak she could say nothing ; but from then on Teroro treated her with extra kindness . It was at this moment , when the captains of the canoe were most agitated , that Tane and Ta'aroa conspired to present them with an omen that erased from all hearts memories of what had just happened . The rain came heavily for about fifteen minutes , followed by strong winds that blew clouds scudding ahead in darkness until the clouds parted and the fine stars of heaven were momentarily revealed . Then it was that the wisdom of Tupuna in setting forth at dusk on the new day of the month became apparent , for there , rising in the eastern sky and with no bright moon in competition , sparkled the Seven Little Eyes . It was their first twilight appearance of the year , their reassuring return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve more months . With what extraordinary joy the voyagers greeted the Little Eyes . From the grass house women came forth and filled their hearts with comfort . Those crew members who had to keep the canoe headed with the wind found new resilience in their tired muscles , and Teroro knew that he was on course . Then , the miracle vouchsafed , Tane drew the clouds once more across the heavens and the storm continued , but contentment beyond measure settled upon the canoe , for it was at last apparent that the company moved in accordance with divine laws . How sweet the roar of the wind that bore them on , how consoling the motion of the waves that carried them into the unknown ; how appropriate the world , how well ordered and secure the heavens . On the canoe , that daring and insignificant bundle of wood lashed together by sennit and men 's wills , all hearts were deep in peace , and the onwardness of their journey sang contentedly in all parts of the craft , so that when old Tupuna crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he called softly to Teroro ahead , " The king is content . The omen proves that Oro was caught by Ta'aroa and conveyed safely to Havaiki . All is well . " And the canoe moved on . The most critical part of any twenty-four-hour period came in the half hour just before dawn , for unless the navigator could catch a glimpse of some known star and thus check course he would have to proceed through an entire day with only the unreliable sun to steer by ; for while it was true that master astronomers like Teroro and Tupuna could followeach movement of the sun and take from it their heading , they could not use it to determine their latitude . For that they depended upon the stars ; their sailing directions reminded them which stars culminated over which islands , and to pass the last moments of night without seeing any constellations was not only an omen of bad luck in the future , it was also proof of present difficulty , which , if it persisted for several days , might develop into catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seven Little Eyes , Teroro and his uncle had waited anxiously for Three-in-a-Row , which other astronomers then living in distant deserts had already named Orion 's Belt , for the sailing directions said that these stars hung over Nuku Hiva , their replenishment point . But Three-in-a-Row had not appearedduring the night watch and Teroro had been unable to determine his latitude . Now the conspicuous stars were setting without having been seen , and the navigator was worried . He had , however , observed on earlier trips that it was a peculiarity of his ocean that in the last few minutes of morning twilight , some star , as if determined to aid mariners , pushed clouds aside and showed itself , and he thought there was still time for this to happen . " Three-in-a-Row will appear there , " Tupuna announced confidently , but Teroro wondered if the night 's strong wind might not have blown the canoe rather farther north than his uncle suspected . " Maybe they will be closer to that cloud , " Teroro suggested . The difference of opinion was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the west to meet the sun rising on the other side of the ocean . On this day dawn was neither inspiring nor refreshing , for the sun straggled reluctantly up behind many layers of cloud , half illuminated the ocean with dull gray and proved to the voyagers that they did not know where they were . Teroro and Tupuna , having accomplished all they could , fell into immediate sleep in the stormy daylight ; and it was then that the latter 's wife , wizened , red-eyed old Teura , paid for her passage . She climbed out of the grass house , splattered sea water over her wrinkled face , rubbed her bleary eyes , threw her head back and started studying the omens . In nearly two thirds of a century of living with the gods , she had unraveledmany of their tricky ways . Now she watched how Ta'aroa moved the waves , how the spume rose , how the tips fell away and in what mannerthey tumbled back into the troughs . She marked the color of the sea and the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midmorning she saw a land bird , possibly from Bora Bora itself , winging its way out to sea , and from its flight she was able to determine the bird 's estimate of how long the storm would continue , and it confirmedher own . A bit of bark , washed out to sea days before from Havaiki , was of particular interest to the old woman , for it proved that the ocean had a northerly set , which was not apparent from the wind , which blew more toward the northeast . But most of all the rheumy-eyed old seer studied the sun , for although it was well masked behind layers of cloud , her practiced eye could mark its motion . " Star men like Tupuna and Teroro do n't think much of the sun , " she snorted , but when she placed her observations of its course beside the deductions she had made from earlier omens she concluded : " Those men do n't know where they are ! We 're far to the north of our course ! " But what Teura particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the knowing . For example , an albatross , not large and of no possible importance as food , happened to fly past the canoe and she saw with gratification that he kept to the left , or Ta'aroa 's side , and since the albatross was known to be a creatureof that god 's , this was a refreshing omen ; but when the bird insisted upon returning to the canoe , also from the left side , and finally perched on the mast of Ta'aroa , the coincidence could no longer be termed an omen . It was a definite message that the god of the oceans had personallysent to an old woman who had long honored him , and Teura looked at the sea with new love , and sang : " 0 , Ta'aroa , god of the boundless deep , Ta'aroa of the mighty wavesAnd the troughs that lead down to blackness , We place our canoe in your hands , In your hands we place our lives . " Contentedly , the old woman gathered her many omens , and they were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the stars remain hidden , and the storm continue , but Ta'aroa was with them and all was well . In the late afternoon , Tupuna and Teroro , before resuming their duties , came aft to find out from Teura where they were , and she advised them that they rode much farther north than even Teroro had suspected . " No , " the men reasoned . " We 've been to Nuku Hiva . Directions do n't call for a turn yet . " " Head for the pit from which Three-in-a-Row climbs , " she warned with stubborn finality , " or you 'll miss Nuku Hiva . " " You wait till the stars come out , " Teroro challenged . " You 'll see we 're on course . " Teura would not argue . For her any problem was simple : either the gods spoke or they did n't , and if they did , it was useless to try to explain to someone else how the message was delivered . " We are far to the north , " she snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " Teroro pleaded . " The gods said so , " she muttered and went to bed . When she was gone , the two men reviewed her various omens , but the only one upon which they were willing to place much reliance was the albatross . " You ca n't have a much better omen than an albatross , " Tupuna reasoned . " If Ta'aroa is with us , " Teroro concluded , " we must be on the right course . " From the grass house old Teura stuck out her head and snapped , " I 've noticed that Ta'aroa stays with a canoe only as long as its men keep it on course . Turn . " That night it could not be proved that Teura was either right or wrong , for no stars appeared , neither in the darkness of midnight nor in the anxiousdawn , and Teroro steered solely by running directly before the wind , with only a small section of sail out , trusting that the storm was steady and not blowing in circles . On the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real danger , Teroro reached a major decision . While consulting with Tupuna he said , " We 've got to believe that the storm is blowing true . " " Arrival of the albatross is best proof of that , " Tupuna pointed out . " Then I think we 'd better take full advantage of it . " HAWAII 76 " You intend hoisting the sails to the peak ? " " Yes . If it is the gods who are sending us , we ought to go forward as fast as we can . " When they presented their proposal to King Tamatoa , he showed his disturbance over the lack of stars and pointed out that the night crew 's estimate of position did not jibe with that of the old woman , but he also appreciated the good sense of his brother 's proposal . " I am much impressed by that albatross , " Tamatoa reasoned . " Teura confided one fact to me that she did n't tell you . When the bird came back the second time to land on the mast of Ta'aroa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The astronomers whistled , for this was a most propitious omen , since it confirmed the leftness of the bird 's intentions and its peculiar inclinationtoward the mast of Ta'aroa . " I can only conclude , " the king reasoned , " that Ta'aroa , for some reason of his own , has sent us this unusual storm . I agree with Teroro . Hoist the sails . " So Teroro sent Mato and Pa up the masts , and in complete darkness , while the canoe was already speeding forward into deep swells , the two young chiefs lashed fast the sturdy matting sails and with shouts of accomplishmentslid down and began to play out the sails until they trapped the wind and whipped the canoe forward . Through the rest of the night and into the third disappointing dawn the canoe raced ahead on a course no man knew , for King Tamatoa realized that there came a time on any voyage when a man and his canoe had to trust the gods and to run forward , satisfied that the sails had been well set and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to disclose known marks , it was obligatory to ride the storm . At daylight , gnawed by uncertainty , the men went to sleep and old Teura came forth to gather omens . A white-bellied petrel wheeled in the sky but said nothing . Fishermen forward caught bonito , which helped conserve food but told nothing about position , and several fine squalls deposited calabashes full of sweet water trapped by the sails . At noon when Teura advised the king that things were going well , he shrewdly asked , " Any omens of position ? " " None , " she replied . " How is the ocean running ? " " No signs of land , no islands ahead , the storm will blow for five more days . " In such brief report she summed up two thousand years of study by her ancestors , and had she been required to explain why she knew that there was no land ahead , she would have been unable to do so . But there was none , and of this she was absolutely certain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No omens , " she repeated . It was now seven days since the storm had risen on the night of Bora Bora 's revenge against Havaiki , and three complete days that the canoe had been at sea , but true to Teura 's prediction and to the amazement of77 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonall , the gale continued , and when the evening watch took over , Teura and the king wondered if the sails should not be lowered , for there were not going to be any stars that night , either . But in the consultation Teroro said , " I am convinced we are going forward , " and since there was no one with superior knowledge to contradict him , Tamatoa asked , " You are willing to keep the sails aloft tonight ? " " We must , " Teroro said . And through that starless night and into the starless dawn , he ran with the storm , insisting upon this because of his canoe 's name . More than a century ago a wise man had named the predecessorof the predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borans went forth driven by the westernhurricane , they went well . And until the stars had a chance to prove the contrary , Teroro was willing to abide by this ancient wisdom . He was somewhat shaken however on the fifth night when Tupuna crept up to the prow and whispered , " I have never known a storm from the west to blow so long . We are entering the ninth night . It surely must have veered . " There was a long pause in the darkness and Teroro looked down at the slim body of his wife , curled against the mast . He wondered what she would say to this problem , but she was not like Marama ; she had no ideas . So he wrestled with the alternatives alone and felt irritated when Tupuna pressed him : " Can you recall a constant wind of such duration ? " " No , " Teroro snapped , and the two men parted . But toward dawn of the fifth day , when it seemed probable that no stars would show , Tupuna became frightened : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where we are . " He insisted upon a conference with the king and Teura , which producedthree voices against Teroro , for it was obvious that the canoe was lost and that to persevere blindly without some confirmation from the stars would be folly . But Teroro could not accept this reasoning . " Of course we 're lost , " he confessed . " But Ta'aroa sent his bird to us in the storm , did n't he ? " " Yes , " they had to agree . " This is n't an ordinary storm , " he argued . " This is an unheard-of gale sent to the canoe of Bora Bora . From the oldest days , what has been the name of our canoe ? " " But we are lost ! " the king reasoned . " We were lost from the moment we set forth , " Teroro cried . " No ! " Tamatoa cried , refusing to be enticed by his brother 's rhetoric . " We were headed for Nuku Hiva . For fresh water and new supplies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chants , " Tupuna added cautiously . " We must lie to , " the king announced firmly . " Then , when we catch a glimpse of Three-in-a-Row , we will know where Nuku Hiva is . " It was under this pressure that Teroro broached his bold plan . HeH A W A I I 78spoke quietly and without gestures , saying , " I am not lost , brother , because I am riding with the desires of Ta'aroa . I am heading with a great storm , and I am content to ride that storm . " " Do you know how to get to Nuku Hiva ? " Teroro looked at each of his companions and replied , " If we are concernedonly with Nuku Hiva , I am lost . If we are going to Nuku Hiva only to get additional food and water , I am lost . But in all sense , brother , do we need to go to Nuku Hiva ? " He waited for these strong words to sink into the hearts of his seafaring companions , and he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , " What is there for us in Nuku Hiva ? To get water we have to fight with those who live there , and some of us will be killed . Do we need water ? To get food we must take great risks , and if we are captured , we are cooked alive and eaten . Do we need food ? Has n't Ta'aroa sent us fresh fish in abundance ? Have we not disciplined ourselves as men have never done before so that each eats only a shred each day ? Brother Tamatoa , if the storm is with us , what extra things do we need ? " Tamatoa resisted his brother 's eloquence and asked , " Then you are lost . You ca n't take us to Nuku Hiva ? " " I can not take you to Nuku Hiva , but I can take you to the north . " As if in support of his bold plan , a sudden force of wind ripped across the waves and spilled into the sails , whipping the canoe along in a burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blotting out the stars and all certainknowledge , came upon the men of Bora Bora . " We are alone on the sea , " Teroro said solemnly . " We are engaged in a special voyage , and if it takes us past Nuku Hiva , then I say good , for we are doubtless being sped by the gods on some great mission . Brother , I beg you , let us keep the sails aloft . " The king would not present this dangerous request to the opinion of the group , for he knew that the old people , Tupuna and Teura , would insist upon caution , and he suspected that perhaps now was a time when caution was not required . Weighing all possibilities , he sided with his brother and said , " We should get some sleep . " So for two more nights , the sixth and seventh of the voyage , the canoe sped on , safe in the mighty arms of Ta'aroa , and in those somber , critical days , all eyes were kept on the left mast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the god Ta'aroa was in command of this canoe . And then , on the late afternoon of the seventh day , red-eyed Teura spotted an omen . On the left side of the canoe came five dolphin , a propitious number in itself , followed by an albatross of some size . The creatures of Ta'aroa had come to celebrate the deliverance of this canoe from the storm , but before Teura could alert her companions to this fine intelligence , an event of transcendent importance occurred . A shark appeared not far from the canoe and followed it lazily for a moment , trying to79 From the Sun-Swept Lagoon catch Teura 's attention , and when she saw it her heart cried with joy , for this great blue beast of the sea had long been her personal god ; and now , while the others were blind with their work , it swam along the left side of the canoe , its blue head above the waves . " Are you lost , Teura ? " it inquired softly . " Yes , Mano , " she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for Nuku Hiva ? " the shark asked . " Yes . I have said that it was . . . " " You will not see Nuku Hiva , " the great blue shark advised . " It is far to the south . " " What shall we do , Mano ? " " Tonight there will be stars , Teura , " the shark whispered . " All the stars that you require . " In perfect contentment the old woman closed her tired red eyes . " Ihave waited for you for many days , " she said softly . " But I did not feel completely lost , Mano , for I knew you must be watching us . " " I 've been following , " the shark said . " Your men were brave , Teura , to keep the sails aloft like that . " Teura opened her eyes and smiled at the shark . " I am ashamed to tell you that I argued against it . " " We all make mistakes , " the blue beast said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see when the stars come out . " And with this consoling assurance , he turned away from the canoe . " There 's a shark out there ! " a sailor cried . " Is that a good omen , Teura ? " " Tarnatoa , " the old woman said quietly , " tonight there will be stars . " And as she spoke two land birds with brown-tipped wings flew purposefullytoward the south and Tamatoa saw them and asked , " Does that mean that our land is far to the south ? " " We shall never see it , Tamatoa , for we are safe on a new heading . " " Are you sure ? " " You will see when the stars come out . " With what excited apprehension Tupuna and Teroro waited for the dusk . They knew that when the Seven Little Eyes peeked above the easternhorizon , the canoe 's course would be apparent ; and when Three-ina-Rowappeared , they could deduce where Nuku Hiva lay . With what apprehensionthey waited . Exactly as Teura had predicted , toward dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it sank , a tremendous exhilaration filled the canoe , for trailing the sun was the bright star of evening , visible even in twilight and soon accompanied by a second wandering star of great brilliance , and like the two gods on whom the canoe depended , the starsmarched grandly toward the rim of the ocean and vanished in their appointedpits of heaven . On the platform old Tupuna called all passengers to silence as he threw81 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonthem tonight than we had a right to expect . If we do not eat too much ... " Even though Tamatoa had given permission to keep the sails aloft , and even though he had known that the canoe thus ran the risk of missing Nuku Hiva , he had nevertheless hoped that they would stumble upon that known island , and perhaps find it congenial , and possibly establish homes there . Now he was committed to the greater journey , and he was fearful . " We could still alter course and find Nuku Hiva , " he suggested . Teroro remained silent and allowed old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well on our way . " " But to where ? " Tupuna repeated the only chant he had ever memorized for sailing to the north . In effect it said : " Keep the canoe headed with the storm until the winds cease completely . Then turn into the dead sea where bones rot with heat and no wind blows . Paddle to the new star , and when winds strike from the east , ride with them westward until land beneath the Seven Little Eyes is found . " The king , himself an adequate astronomer , pointed due north and asked , " Then the lands we seek are there ? " " Yes , " Tupuna agreed . " But we go this way ? " and he pointed eastward , where the winds of the dying storm were driving them . " Yes . " The course seemed so improbable , to head for a promised land by fleeing it , that the king cried , " Can we be sure that this is the way ? " " No , " the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then why . . . " " Because the only knowledge we have says that this is the way to do it . " The king , ever mindful of the fact that fifty-seven people were in his care , grasped Tupuna by the shoulders and asked bluntly , " What do you honestly think about the land that is supposed to be under the Little 11 Eyes ? " The old man replied , " I think that many canoes have left these waters , some blown by storms , others like us in exile , and no man has ever re- turned . Whether these canoes reached land or not , we do not know . But some man , with a vision of what might be , composed that chant . " " Then we are sailing with a dream for our guide ? " Tamatoa asked . " Yes , " the priest answered . Gloom was not allowed to capture the canoe , for the reappearance of the stars had excited the paddlers and the women , so that even while the astronomers were consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grabbed a length of tapa which he had wrapped around his shoulders , masking his head . Now imitating a very fat man , he pranced up and down the platform , shouting , " Who am I ? " " He 's the headless king of Bora Bora ! " Mato cried . " Look at fat Tatai coming to be our king , with his head knocked off ! " back his white head and intoned a prayer : " Oh , Tane , in our preoccupation with the storm of your brother Ta'aroa we have not thought of you as often as we should . Forgive us , benevolent Tane , for we have been fighting to stay alive . Now that the heavens are restored to remind us of your all-seeing kindness , we implore you to look with favor upon us . Great Tane , light the heavens that we may see . Great Tane , show us the way . " And all prayed to Tane and felt his benevolence descend upon them from the nearer heavens . Then , as darkness deepened over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the gallant outstretched sails , the stars began to appear ; first the mighty golden stars of the south , those warm familiar beacons that showed the way to Tahiti , followed by the cold blue stars of the north , scintillating in their accustomed places and competing with the quarter moon . As each star took its position , its friends in the canoe greeted it with cries of recognition , and an assurance that had been absent for many days returned . The critical stars had not yet risen , so that in spite of their joy , men could not suppress the questions that often assailed voyagers : " What if we have sailed away from heavens we knew ? What if the Little Eyes do not rise here ? " Then slowly and uncertainly , for they were not brilliant stars , the sacred group arose , precisely where it should have been , climbingup out of its appropriate pit . " The Little Eyes are still with us ! " Tupuna shotit.ed , and the king raised his head to offer a prayer to the guardians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were built . The astronomers then met to read the signs , and they concluded that the storm had blown fairly steadily from the west , but apparently there had been , as Teura had guessed , a definite drift of the sea northward , for the Little Eyes were going to culminate much higher in the heavens than would be proper were the canoe on course to Nuku Hiva ; but to say specifically how serious the drift had been , the navigators would have to wait until Three-in-a-Row appeared , which would not be for another two hours . So the three plotters waited , and when Three-in-a-Row was well up into the heavens it became self-evident that the canoe was far , far north of the course to Nuku Hiva and was thus committed to an unknown ocean with no opportunity to replenish stores . It was therefore a solemn group that went aft to report to the king : " The storm has carried us even more swiftly than Teroro imagined . " The king 's face showed his distress . " Are we lost ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiva and will see no land we know . " " Then we are lost ? " the king pressed . " No , nephew , we are not , " Tupuna said carefully . " It is true that we have been carried into far regions , but they are not off our course . We seek lands which lie beneath the Seven Little Eyes , and we are nearer toHAWAII 82 83 From the Sun-Swept LagoonIn wild burlesque , Pa ridiculed the coronation of the headless wouldbeking . Paddlers stopped and began to beat rhythms on the canoe , and a woman produced a little drum with a high , almost metallic sound , and the night 's revelry was launched . " What is this new dance ? " Tamatoa inquired . " I 've never seen it before , " Tupuna replied . " Do you know what he 's doing ? " the king asked Teroro . " Yes , " the younger man said hesitantly . " Pa is . . . Well , Tamatoa , some of us heard that fat Tatai was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Tamatoa looked at the headless dancer and asked , " So you sneaked over to Havaiki . . . some of you . . . " " Yes . " " And now Tatai has no head . " " Well . . . yes . You see , we felt . " " You could have ruined the entire voyage , could n't you ? " " We could have , but we figured that Tatai 's village would n't come over to Bora Bora very soon . . . " " Why not ? " " Well , when we left there was n't any village . " In the light of the quarter moon King Tamatoa looked at his daring young brother , and there was much that he would have said , but the sound of ancient drumming stifled his logical thoughts , and with a stirring leap he whirled forward to where Pa was dancing and entered into the ritual dance of the kings of Bora Bora . Like a boy , he gestured and posturedand told forgotten stories , until toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and did the now popular dance of the headless king from Havaiki . When the drums had reached a crescendo he threw off the tapa , stood very straight in the night wind , and exulted : " We did not go like cowards ! I , the king , was afraid to strike at those evil worms , those faces of excrement , those vile and awful dead fish of the stinking lagoon . I was afraid to endanger the coming voyage . But Pa here was not afraid . And Mato was not afraid . And my brother . . . " In gratitude Tamatoa looked aft to where Teroro stood in darkness . The king did not finish his sentence . With demonic energy he leaped into a dance of victory , shouting , " I dance in honor of brave men ! Let 's have the celebration you were denied ! " And he ordered extra rations of food to be broken out , and more drums , and all the water anyone wanted . Like children careless of the dawn , they reveled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on food that should have been conserved . It was a wild , wonderful night of victory , and each half hour someone shouted , " Pa ! Do the dance of the headless king ! " Then , one by one , in savage triumph , they rose and screamed classic island insults at the vanquished . " Havaiki is the strong scent of spoiled meat ! " " The worthless trash of Havaiki take pleasure in their shame . " " Fat Tatai trembles in fear . The hair on his head trembles . He crawls away and hides like a hen in a secret place . " " The warriors of Havaiki are the froth of water , boys playing with mud balls . " Teroro , succumbing to the excitement , shouted , " Fat Tatai is a sneakinglittle dog , excrement of excrement . " But as his voice shrieked in the wind , he happened to look forward to where beautiful Tehani huddled against the masts , weeping as her father was reviled . Then he also saw Mato , from the left hull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the way of victory . You must forgive us . " From the rear new voices rose with foul invective , and the drums beat on . In the rainy dawn , of course , King Tamatoa took gloomy stock of what the celebration had cost and for a moment he thought : " We are children . We discover we 're lost and half an hour later we eat enough food for a week . " Contritely , he issued stringent orders that what had been wasted must be made up by austere rationing . " Even though we have plenty of water , " he warned , " each must drink only a cupful a day . " So , with the remnants of the tempest at their back and with victory in their hearts , the voyagers sailed eastward for the ninth night , and the tenth , and the fifteenth . Their swift canoe , fleetest large craft that ever up to then had plied the oceans of the world , averaged two hundred miles a day , better than eight miles an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lands where Aztecs were building mighty temples , and well onto the approaches of the northern land where Cheyennes and Apaches built nothing . In the direction they were then headed they could encounter no land until they struck the continent itself ; but before that happened they would have perished of thirst and starvation in the doldrums . Nevertheless , they carried on , according to Teroro 's plan . There was fear each dawn when the sun rose ; there was momentary joy each night when the stars reappeared to tell their progress ; for day was the enemy , crowded with uncertainty and the hourly acknowledgment of their forlorn position ; but night was consolation and the spiritual assuranceof known stars , and the waxing of the fat moon through its many stages , and the soft cries of birds at dusk . How tremendous an experience this was , at the end of a long day which had provided only the unstable sun , to watch the return of night and to discover , there in the west where the sun went down , the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastness to see the Little Eyes come peeping with their message : " You are coming closer to the land we guard . " How marvelous , how marvelous the night ! 84 85 From the Sun-Swept LagoonS THE CANOE REACHED EASTWARD and the storm abated , the daily routine became more settled . Each dawn the six slavesstopped bailing and cleaned out the canoe , while farmers moved among the animals and fed them , giving the pigs and dogs fish caught in the early hours , plus some mashed sweet potatoes and fresh water trapped in the sails . The chickens got dried coconut and a fish to pick at , but if they lagged in eating , a slim , dark object darted out from among the freight and grabbed the food away , unseen by the slaves , for as on all such trips , some rats had stowed aboard , and if the voyage turned out badly , they would be the last to die . . . would indeed sustain themselves for many drifting days on those who had already perished . After the women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move inside , throw out the slops and do the other necessary chores . Particularly , they kept clean that corner of the hut which had been cut off by lengths of tapa and reserved for those women who were experiencing their monthly sickness , for it was a tabu entailing death for there to be any communication between men and women at such time . In general , however , the tabus which were rigidly enforced on land had to be suspended aboard a crowded canoe . For example , had any of the rowers while ashore come as near the king as all now were , or had they stepped upon his shadow , or even the shadow of his cape , they would have been killed instantly , but in the canoe the tabu was suspended , and sometimes when the king moved , men actually touched him . They recoiled as if doomed , but he ignored the insult . The tabus which centered upon eating were also held in abeyance , for there was no one aboard of sufficient status to prepare the king 's food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king 's toilet pot come on the journey , so that a slave , terrified at the task , had to throw into the sea the kingly bowel movements , rather than follow the required custom of burying them secretly in a sacred grove , lest enemies find them and with evil spells conjure the king to death . Women upon such a trip did not fare well . Obviously , the food had to be reserved for men who did the hard work of paddling . The pigs and dogs also had to be kept alive to stock the new land , which left little for the women . That was why , at every opportunity , they set fishing lines and tended them carefully . The first fish they caught went to the king and Teroro , the next to Tupuna and his old wife , the next four to the paddlers , the seventh and eighth to the pigs , the ninth to the dogs , the tenth to the chickens and the rats . If there were more , the women could eat . With great niggardliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , but when they were distributed , how good they tasted . A man would get his stick of hard and sour breadfruit , and as he chewed on it he would recall the wasteful feasts he had once held , when abundantbreadfruit , fresh and sweet , had been thrown to animals . But the food that gave most pleasure , the master food of the islands , came when the king directed that one of the bamboo lengths of dried poi be opened , and then the rich purplish starch would be handed out , and as it grew sticky in the mouth , men would smile with pleasure . But soon the poi was finished and the bundles of dried breadfruit diminished . Even the abundant rain ceased and King Tamatoa had to reduce his rations still further , until the crew were getting only two mouthfuls of solid food , two small portions of water . Women and slaves got half as much , so that unless the fishermen could land bonito , or trap water in the sails , all existed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Teroro made one discovery , a tormenting and frustrating one made by all similar voyagers : when the tongue was parched and the body scorched with heat , when one 's whole being craved only water , an unexpected squall often passed a mile to the left or right , dumping untold quantities of water upon the sea , just out of reach , but it was no use paddling furiously to overtake the squall , for by the time the canoe reached the spot where the rain had been falling , the squall had moved on , leaving all hands hotter and thirstier than before . Not even an expert navigator like Teroro could anticipate the vagariesof a rain squall and intercept it ; all one could do was to plod patientlyon , his lips burning with desire and his eyes aflame , trying to ignore the cascades of water that were being dumped out of reach ; but one could also pray that if one did continue purposefully , in a seamanlikemanner , sooner or later some squall would have to strike the canoe . On a voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this did not keep the king from gazing often at his stately wife Natabu ; and old Tupuna saw to it that Teura got some of his food ; and in the heat of day Tehani would dip a length of tapa into the sea , cool it , and press it over her husband 's sleeping form . At night , when the stars were known and the course set , the navigator would often sit quietly beside the vivaciousgirl he had brought with him and talk with her of Havaiki , or of his youth on Bora Bora , and although she rarely had anything sensible to say in reply , the two did grow to respect and treasure each other . But the most curious thoughts between men and women involved the twelve unassigned women and the thirty-four unattached men . Perhaps the word unassigned is not completely accurate to describe the women , because some of them in Bora Bora had been specific wives of individual men , but on such an expedition it was understood that upon landing , any such woman would accept as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no wives , and no one considered this strange . So on the long voyage men with no women began cautiously to do two things : to form close friendships with men who had women , establishing a congenialgroup of three or four who would later share one woman as their common wife ; or to study the unmarried women in an effort to decide which one could most satisfactorily be shared with one 's group ; so thatHAWAII 86 87 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonbefore the voyage had consumed even fifteen days , groups had begun to crystallize , and without anything definite having been said , it was remarkablywell understood that this woman and these three men would build a house for themselves and raise common children , or that that husband and wife would accept those two friends of the man into complete and intimate harmony , thus populating the new land . It was further understood that each woman , until she reached the age when children no longer came , would be kept continuously pregnant . The same , of course , was true of the sows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to populate an empty , new land . On the eleventh night occurred an event which , in its emotional impact upon a people who lived by the stars , had no equal on this voyage . Even the abandonment of Oro had failed to generate the excitement caused by this phenomenon . As the West Wind crept constantly northward it became obvious to the astronomers on board that they must lose , and forever , many old familiar stars which lay below what astronomers would later call the Southern Cross . It was with sorrow , and even occasionally with tears , that Tupuna would follow some particular star which as a boy he had loved , and watch it vanish into the perpetual pit of the sky from which stars no more rise . Whole constellations were washed into the sea , never to be seen again . Although this was cause for regret , it did not occasion alarm , for the men of Bora Bora were exceptional astronomers . They had developed , from careful observation , a year of 365 days , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to keep the seasons aligned . Their ritual life was organized around a moon-month of twenty-nine and a half days , which is the easy way to build a calendar ; but their year of twelve months was founded on the sun , which is the right way . They could predict with accuracy the new appearance and subsequent motion of the wandering stars , while the merest glimpse of the moon told them in what phase it stood , for each night of the moon-month bore its own special name , derived from the progress of the moon through its cycle . Men like Tupuna and Teroro even knew , by counting ahead six months , in what constellation the sun stood ; so they were prepared , as they sailed north , to lose some of their familiar stars ; conversely , they knew that they would come upon new stars , and it was with the joy of discovery that they identified the hitherto unseen stars of the north . But in all their wisdom , they were not prepared for what they discovered on the eleventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern heavens when the old man saw , bobbing above the waves , a new star , not of maximum brightness like the vast beacons of the south  --  for the voyagers found the northern stars rather disappointing in brilliance in comparison with theirs  --  but nevertheless an interesting newcomer . " See how it lies in a direct line from the two stars in Bird-with-aLong-Neck , " Tupuna pointed out , referring to stars which others called the Big Dipper . At first Teroro could not catch the bright star , for it danced up and down on the horizon , now visible above the waves , now lost . Then he saw it , a bright , clean , cold star , well marked in an empty space of the sky . Speaking as a navigator he said , " That would be a strong star to steer by . . . when it rises a little higher . " Tupuna observed , " We must watch carefully , the next few nights , to see which pit of heaven it goes into . " So on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as dawn appeared each was afraid to tell the other what he had seen , for each realized that he had stumbled upon an omen of such magnitude that it did not bear speaking of . Each keeping his own counsel , the two astronomers spent the last minutes of darkness watching the new star with an apprehension that bordered upon panic , and when daylight ended their vigil , they licked their dry lips and went to their beds knowing they would not sleep . It was no more than midafternoon on the following day when the two men took their positions to study the heavens . " Stars wo n't be out for many hours , " Tupuna said warily . " I 'm watching the sun , " Teroro lied , and when Tehani brought him his water and stood smiling by the mast of Tane , her preoccupied husband did not bother to smile back , so she went aft with the women . Swiftly , at six in the evening , and not lingeringly as at Bora Bora , the sun left the sky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LittleEyes , blessing the canoe , and later Three-in-a-Row , now well to the south , and the very bright stars of Tahiti ; but what the men watched was only the strange new star . There it was , and for nine hours the two astronomersstudied it , unwilling to come to the conclusion that was inescapable . But when they had triangulated the sky in every known way , when they had proved their frightening thesis beyond doubt , they were forced , each working by himself , to the terrifying conclusion . It was Tupuna who put it into words : " The new star does not move . " " It is fixed , " Teroro agreed . The two men used these words in a new meaning ; they had always spoken of the bright wandering stars that moved in and out of the constellationslike beautiful girls at a dance ; and they had contrasted these with the stars of fixed position ; but they realized that in a grand sense the latter also moved , rising out of pits in the east and falling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Southern Cross , rose from one pit and quickly dropped into another , and there were even a few that never disappeared below the waves ; but all moved through the heavens . The new star did not . " We had better consult with the king , " Tupuna advised , but when they went aft they found Tamatoa sleeping , and no man would dareHAWAII 88 89 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonwaken another suddenly , lest the sleeper 's spirit be out wandering and have no time to slip back in through the corner of the eye . A man without a spirit would go mad , but Tamatoa slept soundly and his uncle grew nervous , holding as he did the news of the ominous fixed star . " Could you cough ? " he asked Teroro . The navigator did , but with no results . " What would let him know we are waiting ? " Tupuna asked petulantly . He went outside the grass house , took a paddle and tapped the side of the canoe , whereupon the king , like any captain who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cleared his throat and gave his wandering spirit ample time to climb back into his eye . " What 's happening ? " " An omen of terrible significance , " Tupuna whispered . They showed Tamatoa the new star and said , " It does not move . " Anxiously , the three watched for an hour and then summoned old Teura , advising her : " Tane has set a star in the heavens which does not move . What can it signify ? " The old woman insisted upon an hour in which to study the phenomenonfor herself , at the end of which she decided that the men were correct . The star did not move , but how should such an omen be read ? She said , haltingly , " Tane is the keeper of the stars . If he has placed this miracle before us , it is because he wishes to speak to us . " " What is his message ? " the king asked apprehensively . " I have never seen such an omen , " Teura parried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and immovable , before us ? " Tamatoa asked , for it was his responsibility to keep the voyage harmonious with the will of the gods . Others could afford to misinterpret omens , but not he . " It would seem so , " Teura said . " Else why would the star be set there , like a rock ? " Apprehension gripped them , for if Tane was against this voyage , all must perish . They could not go back now . " And yet , " Tupuna recalled , " the chant says that when the west wind dies , we are to paddle across the sea of no wind toward the new star . Is this not the new star , fixed there for us to use ? " For many minutes the group discussed this hopeful concept and concluded that it might have merit . They decided , therefore , that this should be done : continue for the coming day along the course set by the westerly wind and consult again at dusk , weighing all omens . The four went to their appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainingmoments of the night Teroro stood alone in the prow studying the new star , and gradually a new idea germinated in his brain , tentatively at first , like a drum beating in the far distance , and then with compellingintensity . He began softly : " If this new star is fixed . . . Suppose it actually does hang there night after night and at all hours . . . Let 's say thatevery star in the new heavens can be associated with it in known patterns . . . " He lost the thread of some compelling thought and started over again . " If this star is immovable , it must hang at a known distance above the horizon . . . No , that 's not right . What I mean is , for every island , this fixed star must hang at a known distance . . . Start with Tahiti . We know exactly what stars hang directly over Tahiti at each hour of the night for each night of the year . Now if this fixed star . . . " Again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he sensed that some grand design of the gods was making itself manifest , so he wrapped one arm around the mast of Tane and concentrated his entire being upon the new star . " If it hangs there forever , then every island must stand in some relationship to it . Therefore , once you see how high that star is , you know exactly how far north or south you must sail in order to find your island . If you can see the star , you will know ! You will know ! " Suddenly , and with dazzling clarity , Teroro saw an entirely new system of navigation based on Tane 's gift , the fixed star , and he thought : " Life must be sweet indeed for sailors in these waters ! " For he knew that northern sailors had what southerners did not : a star which could tell them , at a single glance , their latitude . " The heavens are fixed ! " he cried to himself . " And I shall be free to move beneath them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked at him prior to dawn , and he whispered to them , " The new land you lead us to must be sweet indeed if it exists in such an ordered ocean beneath such an ordered sky . " And for the rest of the voyage , through the terrible days that lay ahead , Teroro alone , of all the canoe , knew no fear . He was sure . He was secure in his conviction that Tane would not have hung that fixed star where it was except for no one cause to think that he merited his name , the Brain ; certainly he could never be a knowledgeable priest like his uncle Tupuna , and that was a pity , for priests were needed . Nor had he wisdom in political counsels like his brother ; but on this night he proved that he could do something that none of his companions could : he could look at the evidence planted in the universe and from it derive a new concept , and a greater thing than this no mind can accomplish . On what Teroro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built and their location in the ocean determined . In his joy of discoveryTeroro wanted to sing , but he was not a poet . Yet in his very moment of triumph , he experienced an emptiness that had been with him for many days and which apparently was not going to dissipate . When he finally grasped the significance of the fixed star , he wanted to discuss his concept with Marama , but she was absent and there was not much use talking about a thing like this with Tehani , for whereas Marama would have grasped the idea at once , beautiful little Tehani would have looked at the heavens and asked , " What star ? " It was curiousHAWAII 90 91 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonthe way in which Marama 's last cry persisted in Teroro 's ears : " I am the canoe ! " In a most strange way , she was , for she was the on-going spirit of the canoe ; it was her grave face that Teroro often saw ahead of him on the waves , and when Wait-for-the-West-Wind in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the canoe swept past , and Teroro felt that all was well . Into the arid heat of the doldrums they plunged . The sun beat upon them by day and the rainless stars mocked them at night . Now not even distant squalls passed with the tantalizing hope that rain might come . They knew it would not . Teroro planned so that Mato and Pa , the two sturdiest paddlers , would not work at the same time ; also , after an hour 's stint in the right hull , which tore the muscles of the left shoulder , the paddlers would shift sides and wear out their right shoulders . At each shift six men would drop out and rest . But onward the canoe went , constantly . From time to time the stronger women would take paddles , whereupon the shift was shortened to half an hour ; while in the bottom of each hull the artisans and the slaves worked constantly baling the water that seeped in through the calked cracks where the pieces of log which formed the hull had been tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all , that in the storm when fresh water was plentiful , the sails did most of the work , whereas now , when men sweated and strained endlessly with the paddles , there was no water . The king ordered it to be doled out in ever-decreasing portions , so that the harder the men worked , the less they had to drink . The women , with scarcely any water , suffered miserably , while the slaves were near death . The farmers had an especially cruel task . Tenderlythey would hold open the mouth of a pig and drop water inside to keep the animal alive , whereas they needed the fluid more than the animal ; but the death of a farmer could be tolerated ; the death of a pig would have been catastrophe . Still the canoe bore on . At night Teroro , with his lips burning , would place on the platform near the prow a half coconut , filled with placid sea water , and in it he would catch the reflection of the fixed star , and by keeping this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At daybreak , red-eyed Teura would sit in the blazing heat , her old body almost desiccated by the sun , and speculate upon the omens . Hour after hour she muttered , " What will bring rain ? " The flight of birds might indicate where islands were , and water , but no birds flew . " Red clouds in patches in the eastern sky bring rain , for certain , " she recalled , but there were no clouds . At night the moon was full , brilliant as a disk of polished Tridacna , but when she studied the moon she found no ring around it , no omen of storm . " If there were a wind , " she muttered , " it might bring us to a storm , " but there was no wind . Repeatedly shechanted : " Stand up , stand up , the big wave from Tahiti . Blow down , blow down , the great wind from Moorea . " But in these new seas her invocationswere powerless . Day followed day of remorseless heat , worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth day one of the women died , and as her body was plunged into the perpetual care of Ta'aroa , god of the mysterious deep , the men who were to have been her husbands wept , and through the entire canoe there was a longing for rain and the cool valleys of Bora Bora , and it was not surprising that many began to deplore having come upon this voyage . Hot nights were followed by blazing days , and the only thing that seemed to live in the canoe was the dancing new star as it leaped about in the coconut cup which Teroro studied ; and then late one night as the navigator watched his star , he saw on the horizon , lighted by the moon , a breath of storm . It was small at first , and wavering , and Mato whispered , " Is that rain ? " At first Teroro would not reply , and then , with a mighty shout , he roared into the night , " Rain ! " The grass house emptied . The sleeping paddlers wakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind rose , and a light capping of the sea could be seen in starlight . It must be a substantial storm , and not a passing squall . It was worth pursuing , and everyone began to paddle furiously . Those with no paddles used their hands , and even the king , distraughtwith hope , grabbed a bailing bucket from a slave and paddled with it . How desperately they worked , and how tantalizingly the storm eluded them . Through the remaining portion of the night , the canoe sped on , its men collapsing with thirst and exhaustion , in pursuit of the storm . They did not catch it , and as the blazing day came upon them , driving the clouds back to the horizon , and then beyond , an awful misery settled upon the canoe . The paddlers , their strength exhausted in the fruitless quest , lay listless and allowed the sun to beat upon them . Teroro was of no use . Old Tupuna was near death , and the pigs wept protestingly in the waterless heat . Only the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceaselessly . " Great Tane , you have always been generous to us in the past , " he cajoled . " You have given us taro and breadfruit in abundance . You brought our pigs to fatness and birds to our traps . I am grateful to you , Tane . I am loyal to you . I prefer you above all other gods . " He continued in this way for many minutes , hot sweat upon his face , remindingthe deity of their close and profitable relationships in the past . Then , from the depth of his despair , he pleaded : " Tane , bring us rain . " From a short distance forward , red-eyed Teura heard the king praying and crept back to him , but she brought him terror , not assurance , for she whispered , " The fault is mine , nephew . " " What have you done ? " the king asked in spittle-dry tones . " Two nights before we left Bora Bora I had a dream and I ignored it . A voice came to me crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " the king rasped , catching his aunt 's withered arm . " That was my dream . " " A voice crying , You have forgotten me ! ' Was that your dream , too ? " " No , " the king replied in ashen tones . " Two stars , combing the heavens , looking for something I had forgotten to put into the canoe . " " Was that why you unpacked everything at the last ? " Teura asked . " Yes . " " And you discovered no lack ? " " Nothing . " The two wise people , on whom the success of this voyage now depended , sat despondent . " What have we forgotten ? " They could find no answer , but they knew , each now fortified with substantiation from the other , that this voyage was conducted under an evil omen . " What have we forgotten ? " they pleaded . In bleak despair they stared at each other and found no answer , so Teura , her eyes already inflamed from watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed for omens , and as she gave her whole being to this duty , the great blue shark came beside the canoe and whispered , " Are you afraid that you will die , Teura ? " " Not for myself , " she replied calmly . " I 'm an old woman . But my twonephews . . . Is n't there anything you can do for them , Mano ? " " You have n't been watching the horizon , " the shark admonished . " Where ? " " To the left . " And as she looked , she saw a cloud , and then a disturbance ruffling the ashen sea , and then the movement of a storm , and rain . " Oh , Mano , " she whispered , afraid to believe . " Is the rain coming toward us ? " " Look , Teura , " the great blue shark laughed . " Once before it looked the same , " she whispered . " This time follow me , " the blue beast cried , and with a shimmering leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her salvation . With a wild scream she cried , " Rain ! Rain ! " And all rushed out from the house , and dead sleepers wakened to find a storm bearing down upon them . " Rain ! " they mumbled as it marched across the ocean nearer and nearer . " It 's coming ! " Tamatoa shouted . " Our prayers are answered . " But old Teura , laughing madly as the benign water struck her face , saw in the heart of the storm her own god , Mano , his blue fin cutting the waves . Almost as if by command , the near-dying voyagers began to throw off their clothes , their tapa and their shells , until each stood naked in the divine storm , drinking it into their eyes and their blistering armpits and their parched mouths . The winds rose , and the rains increased , but the naked men and women of Bora Bora continued their revel in the slashingwaves . The sails came down and the mast of Ta'aroa was almost carried away , and the dogs whined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their mouths and embraced each other . Into the night the storm continued , and it seemed as if the sections of the canoe must break apart , but no one called for the storm to abate . They fought it and drank it and washed their aching bodies with it , and sailed into the heart of it , and toward morning , exhausted in sheer joy , they watched as the clouds parted and they saw that they were almost under the path of the Seven Little Eyes , and they knew that they must ride with the easterly wind that had brought the storm . Their destination lay somewhere to the west . I T WAS A LONG leg to windward they took . For nearly two thousandmiles they ran before the easterlies , covering most days more than a hundred and fifty miles . Now the fixed star remained at about the same height above the horizon , on their right , and they followed close to the path of Little Eyes . At sunset Teroro would tilt his coconut cup backward to catch the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east . Later , as the constellation which men in the deserts had named the Eagle sank into the west , he would steer by its bright star , shifting back and forth between it ahead and Little Eyes to the rear , thus keeping always on course . It was on this long westward leg that King Tamatoa 's earlier insistence on discipline preserved the voyage , for now food had run perilously low and for some perverse reason the numerous fish in these strange waters would not bite ; Tupuna explained that it was because they lived under the influence of the fixed star and that the Bora Bora fishhooks had not been adjusted to this new consideration . Every woman and all men who were not paddling kept lines , long and short , in the sea , but to no avail . There was a little coconut left and a small amount of breadfruit , but no taro . Even the pigs , absolutely essential to the success of the journey , were famishing . But in this extremity the thirty paddlers , who worked constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard little fists , shrunk to nothing under tight belly muscles . Their strong shoulders , devoid of even a trace of fat after nearly a month 's steady work , seemed able to generate energy from nothing . With neither food nor adequate water , the men sweated little ; through sunreddenedeyes they constantly scanned the horizon for omens . It was old Teura , however , who saw the first substantial sign ; on the twenty-seventh morning she saw a small piece of driftwood , torn away from some distant tree , and Teroro avidly directed the canoe toward it . When it was pulled aboard it was found to contain four land worms , which were fed to the astonished chickens . El A W A I I 94 95 From the Sun-Swept Lagoon " It has been in the ocean less than ten days , " Teura announced . Since the canoe could travel five or six times faster than a drifting branch , it seemed likely that land lay somewhere near ; and old Teura entered into a period of intense concentration , clutching at omens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But West Wind was not to be saved by incantations . It was Mato , a trained sailor , who late one afternoon saw in the distance a flock of birds flying with determination on a set course westward . " There 's land ahead . They 're heading for it , " he cried . Tupuna and Teroro agreed , and when , a few hours later , the stars rose , it was reassuring to see that the Seven Little Eyes confirmed that they were near the end of their journey . " A few more days , " Teroro announced hopefully . And two days later , aching with hunger , Mato again spotted a bird , and this one was of special significance , for it was a gannet , poised seventy feet in the air ; suddenly it raised its wings , dropped its head toward the waves , and plunged like a thrown rock deep into the ocean . It looked as if it must have split its skull on impact , but by some mysterious trick , it had not , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deftly it flipped the food into its gullet , then plunged again with head-splitting force . " We are surely approaching land ! " Mato cried . But many on the plat- form thought of the gannet not as a harbinger of land , but rather as a lucky bird that knew how to fish . In the early morning of the twenty-ninth day a group of eleven long black birds with handsome cleft tails flew by on a foraging trip from their home island , which lay somewhere beyond the horizon , and Teroro noted with keen pleasure that their heading , reversed , was his , and while he watched he saw these intent birds come upon a group of diving gannets , and when those skilled fishers rose into the air with their catch , the fork- tailed birds swept down upon them , attacked them , and forced them to drop the fish , whereupon the foragers caught the morsels in mid-air and flew away . From their presence it could be deduced that land was not more than sixty miles distant , a fact which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected in the waves of the sea a pecul- iar pattern which indicated that in the near distance the profound west- erly set of the ocean was impounding upon a reef , which shot back echo waves that cut across the normal motion of the sea ; but unfortunately a heavy bank of cloud obscured the western horizon , reaching even to the sea , and none could detect exactly where the island lay . " Do n't worry ! " Teura reassured everyone . " When the clouds do lift , watch their undersides carefully . At sunset you 'll see them turn green over the island . Reflections from the lagoon . " And so convinced was Teura that they were approaching some small island like Bora Bora with a lagoon , that she chose the spot from which the wave echoes seemed to be generating and stared fixedly at it . As she had hoped , toward dusk the clouds began to dissipate , and it was Teura who first saw the new island looming ahead . Gasping , she cried , " Oh , great Tane ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shouted Teroro . And there before them , rearing from the sea like an undreamed-of monster , rose a tremendous mountain more massive than they had ever imagined , crowned in strange white and soaring majestically into the evening sunset . " What a land we have found ! " Teroro whispered . " It is the land of Tane ! " King Tamatoa announced in a hushed whisper . " It reaches to heaven itself . " And all in the canoe , seeing this clean and wonderful mountain , fell silent and did it reverence , until Pa cried , " Look ! It is smoking ! " And as night fell , the last sight the men of Bora Bora had was of a gigantic mountain , hung in the heavens , sending fumes from its peak . The vision haunted the voyagers , for they knew it must be an omen of some proportions , and in the quiet hours of the night old Teura dreamed and woke screaming . The king hurried to her side , and she whispered , " 1 know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew , to where no one could hear , and she confided : " The same dream returned . I heard this voice crying , You have forgotten me . ' But this time I recognized the voice . We have left behind a goddess whom we should have brought . " King Tamatoa felt a sick quaking near his heart and asked , " What goddess ? " for he knew that if a goddess felt insulted , there was no restrictionon the steps she might take in exacting revenge ; her capacity was limitless . " It is the voice of Pere , the ancient goddess of Bora Bora , " the old woman replied . " Tell me , nephew , when your wandering stars were searching the heavens , were they not attended by specks of fire ? " The king tried to recall his haunting premonitory dream and was able , with extraordinary clarity , to conjure it , and he agreed : " There were specks of fire . Among the northern stars . " They summoned Tupuna and told him the burden of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the goddess Pere who had wanted to come on the voyage , whereupon his nephew asked , " But who is Pere ? " " In ancient days on Bora Bora , " the old man explained as the thinhornedcurve of the dying moon rose in the east , " our island had mountains that smoked , and Pere was the goddess of flame who directed our lives . But the flame died away and we supposed that Pere had left us , and we no longer worshiped the red-colored rock that stood in the temple . " " I had forgotten Pere , " Teura confessed . " Otherwise I would have recognized her voice . But tonight , seeing the smoking mountain , I re-membered . " H A W A I I 96 97 From the Sun-Swept Lagoon " And she is angry with us ? " the king asked . " Yes , " Teura replied . " But Tane and Ta'aroa are with us , and they will protect us . " The old seers went back to their places , and the king was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now barely visible in the misty moonlight . He was disturbed that a man could take so much care to satisfy the gods , and that he could nevertheless fail . He could study the omens , bend his will to them , and live only at the gods ' commands ; but always some small thing intruded ; an old woman fails to recognize the voice of a goddess and disaster impinges upon an entire venture . He knew the rock of Pere ; it had been retained in the temple for no known reason , both its name and its properties forgotten ; it was no longer even dressed in feathers . It would have been so simple to have brought that rock , but the facts had eluded him and now he felt at the mercy of a revengeful goddess who had been deeply insulted , the more so because she had taken the trouble to warn him . He beat his hands against the poles of the grass hut and cried , " Why can we never do anything right ? " If the king was perplexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other passengers who were terrified . In the rear of the left hull , the slaves huddled in darkness , whispering . The four men were telling the two women that they had loved them and that they hoped the women were pregnant and that they would bear children , even though those children would be slaves . They recalled the few good days they had known on Bora Bora , the memorable days when they had chanced upon one of the king 's stray pigs and had eaten it surreptitiously , for to have done so openly would have meant immediate death , or the days when the high nobles were absent from the island and they had been free to breathe . In the fading darkness of the night , for a day of great terror was about to dawn , they whispered of love , of human affection and of lost hopes ; for the four men knew that when the canoe landed , a temple would be built , and when the four corner post holes had been dug , deep and sound , one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit would foreverhold the temple securely aloft , and the doomed men could already feel the taste of earth in their nostrils ; they could feel the pressure of the sacred post upon their vitals ; and they knew death . Their two women , soon to be abandoned , could taste worse punishment , for they had come to love these four men ; they knew how gentle they were , how kind to children and how alert to the world 's beauty . Soon , for no ascertainable reason , the men would be sacrificed , and then the women would live on the edge of their community , and if they were already pregnant , and if their children were sons , they would be thrown under the prows of canoes to bless the wood and to be torn in shreds by it . Then when they were not pregnant , on strange nights men of the crew , their faces masked , would rudely force their way into the slave compartments , lie with the women , and go away , for if it were known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be punished ; but all had such contact . And when the children of these unions were born , they would be slaves ; and if they grew to manhood , they would be ripped to pieces under canoes or hung about the altars of gods ; and if they grew to comely womanhood , they would be ravished at night by men they never knew . And the cycle would go on through all eternity , for they were slaves . In the early light of morning it became apparent that the smoking mountain and its supporting island lay much farther away than had at first been supposed , and a final day of hunger and work faced the paddlers ; but the visible presence of their goal spurred the famished men so that by nightfall it was certain that next morning the long voyage would end . Through the last soft tropical night , with the luminous mountainahead , the crew of the West Wind followed their rhythmic , steady beat . As they approached the end of a trek nearly five thousand miles long , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other parts of the world were doing . In the Mediterranean , descendants of once-proud Phoenicians , who even in their moments of glory had rarely ventured out of sight of land , now coasted along establishedshores and occasionally , with what was counted bravery , actually cut across the trivial sea in voyages covering perhaps two hundred miles . In Portugal men were beginning to accumulate substantial bodies of information about the ocean , but to probe it they were not yet ready , and it would be six hundred more years before even near-at-hand islands like Madeira and the Azores would be found . Ships had coasted the shores of Africa , but it was known that crossing the equator and thus losing sight of the North Star meant boiling death , or falling off the edge of the world , or both . On the other side of the earth , Chinese junks had coasted Asia and in the southern oceans had moved from one visible island to the next , termingthe act heroism . From Arabia and India , merchants had undertaken considerable voyages , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continents to the west of Europe , no men left the land . Only in the north of Europe did the Vikings display enterprise even remotely comparable to that of the men of Bora Bora ; but even they had not yet begun their long voyages , though they had at their disposal metals , large ships , woven sails , books and maps . It was left to the men of the Pacific , men like cautious Tamatoa and energetic Teroro , to meet an ocean on its own terms and to conquer it . Lacking both metals and maps , sailing with only the stars and a few lengths of sennit , some dried taro and positive faith in their gods , these men accomplished miracles . It would be another seven centuries before an Italian navigator , sailing under the flag of Spain and fortified by allII AWAII 98 99 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonthe appurtenances of an advanced community , would dare , in three large and commodious ships well nailed together , to set forth upon a voyage not quite so far and only half as dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the southeastern shore of the vast volcanic island that rose from the southeast end of the rupture in the ocean floor . When the shoreline became visible , the voyagershad many thoughts . Teroro reflected in some disappointment : " It 's all rocks . Where are the coconuts ? Where 's the water ? " Mato , who paddledin the hull nearest the land , thought : " No breadfruit . " But King Tamatoa mused : " It is the land Tane brought us to . It must be good . " Only Tupuna appreciated the profound problems which the next few hours would bring . In trembling apprehension he thought : " The children of my brothers are about to step upon new land . Everything depends on the next minutes , for this island is obviously filled with strange gods , and we must do nothing to offend them . But will I be able to placate them all ? " So he moved with agitation about the canoe , endeavoring to arrange things so that the unknown gods would be offended as little as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he warned . " Do n't break a branch or eat a shellfish . " Then he went to the gods ' house and called Pa to his side , handing him a square of flat stone . " You will follow me , " he said , " because you are extremely brave . " He adjusted the king 's feather cape , handed Teroro a spear , and lifted into his own shaking hands the two gods , Tane and Ta'aroa . " Now ! " he cried , and the canoe touched land . First to disembark was Tamatoa , and as soon as he had made one footprintin the sand , he stopped , kneeled down , and took that earth into his hands , bringing it to his lips , where he kissed it many times . " This is the land , " he chanted gravely . " This is a man 's home . This is good land to settle upon , a good land on which to have children . Here we shall bring our ancestors . Here we bring our gods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood Tupuna , his face upraised . " Tane , we thank you for the safe voyage , " he whispered . Then , in penetrating voice , he called , " You unknown gods ! You brave and gentle gods who hold this island ! You fine and generous gods of the smoking mountain ! You forty gods , you forty thousand gods , you forty million gods ! Allow us to land . Allow us to share your treasures , and we will honor you . " He was about to step ashore with his own gods , but the idea of invading a new land was too overpowering , so he shouted once more , " Terrible , all-seeing gods , may I please land ? " He stepped upon the land , expecting some awful omen , but none came and he told Pa , " You may bring the rock of Bora Bora onto its new home , " and the shark-faced warrior leaped ashore with the only lasting memorial of home : a square of rock . When he stood beside the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spear . " But when it came time for Teroro to Ieave the canoe , he did not worry about new gods . He placed his two hands on the prow of Wait-for-theWest-Windand whispered , as gently as if he were speaking to Marama , " Beautiful , lovely ship . Forgive me for cutting away your glory . You are the queen of the ocean . " And he leaped ashore to guard his brother in the next fateful moments . Tupuna left three warriors at the canoe to guard it , while the others strung out in line and formed the solemn procession that would invade the island . At the head of his nervous column marched Tupuna , and whenever he came to a large rock , he begged the god of that rock to let him pass . When he came to a grove of trees he cried , " God of these trees , we come in friendship . " They had gone only a short distance inland when a passing cloud dropped misty rain upon them , and Tupuna shouted , " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the rainbow ends ! " It was Pa , holding the stone of Bora Bora , who saw the arc come to earth , and Tupuna cried , " There will be our temple ! " And he hurried to the spot , crying , " Any evil that is here , Tane , push it aside , for this is to be your temple ! " The foot of the rainbow had fallen on an inviting plateau overlooking the ocean , and Tamatoa said , " This is a good omen indeed . " Then he and his white-bearded uncle began their search for a high male rock , for both knew that the earth itself was female , and therefore polluted , but that solid rocks of impermeable stone were male , and therefore uncontaminated , and after a long search he found a large protrusion of male rock coming erect out of fine reddish soil , and when Tupuna saw it he said , " A perfect site for an altar . " So Pa placed upon this male rock his slab of Bora Bora stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for upon the flat stone Tupuna reverently placed the fine old gods Tane and Ta'aroa . Then he climbed back to the sea with a coconut cup which he filled with water , and this he sprinkled over the temple area , over the gods , and over every human being who had come in the canoe , flicking it into their faces with the long finger of his right hand . " Now let us purify ourselves , " he said , leading every living thing into the ocean : king , warrior , pig , chicken and breadfruit bundle . In the cool sea the voyagers replenished themselves and a canny woman cried , as soon as the job was done , " Do you know what I stood on ? Hundreds of shellfish ! " And all who were purified fell back into waves and began routing out succulent shellfish . Prying the sweet snails loose , they popped them into their mouths and grinned . When they were satiated , Tupuna announced , " Now we must design the temple , " and the slaves began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plateau , and while they watched , he and Tamatoa laid out the four sacred corners of the temple , and large piles of rock were collected about deep holes which the farmers dug . The king signaled his warriors to bury the four quaking slaves , butH A W A I I 100 101 From the Sun-Swept LagoonTeroro prevented the sacrifice . Placing himself before the slaves , he pleaded : " Brother , let us not launch our new island by more killing . " Tamatoa , astonished , explained : " But the temple must be upheld ! " " Tane does n't require that ! " Teroro argued . " But we have always done so . " " Is n't that why we left Havaiki and red Oro ? " " But that was Oro , " the king rationalized . " This is Tane . " " Brother ! I beg you ! Do n't start this killing ! " Then , remembering how his best men had been sacrificed , he pleaded : " Ask the men ! " But this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It concerned his relationship to the gods ; perhaps the entire fortune of the voyage depended on these next few minutes . " Your words are ill timed , " he said stubbornly . Tupuna supported him , grumbling petulantly , " From the beginning of time , temples have been held up by men . " " Bury the slaves ! " Tamatoa ordered . But again Teroro spread his arms before them and cried , " Brother , do n't do this thing ! " Then an idea came to him and he pleaded , " If we must sacrifice to Tane , let us sacrifice the male pig . " For a moment the idea was appealing ; all knew that Tane loved pig sacrifices more than any other . But Tupuna killed the suggestion . " We must keep the boar to breed more pigs , " he said flatly , and all agreed . But Teroro , impassioned by his desire to start the colony correctly , cried , " Wait ! Long ago when we had no pigs , we gave Tane ulua , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation , the old man nodded . " The gods are pleased with man-of-the-sea , " he admitted . " Give me half an hour , " Teroro pleaded , and he took six of his best fishermen , and they waded onto the reef and cast their lines and Teroro prayed , " Ta'aroa , god of the sea and of the fish that live therein , send us ulua to save men 's lives . " And when they had caught eight , two for each corner , they returned to the plateau , and Tamatoa looked at the big handsome fish and said , " For three of the corners we will use the man-of-the-sea . But for the essential corner we will use a man . " " Please . . . " Teroro began , but the king roared in anger , " Silence ! You are in command of the canoe , but I am in command of the temple . What would Tane say if we begrudged him his due ? " So , in anxiety of spirit , Teroro left the scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occur , and if the priest and the king conspired to kill him for his offense , he did not care . He sat on a distant rock and thought : " We flee an evil , but we bring it with us , " and he knew bitterness . When he was gone the king said to Mato , " Bury the fish , " and they were placed in three of the holes . Then he directed : " Mato , bring us one , of the slaves . " And the warrior went to the six who huddled apart andsaid bluntly : " I am sent by the king to select one of you to be the spirit for the temple . " Although the slaves were gratified that only one had to die , they were anguished that the choice of that one was forced on them . Looking at one another , they asked , " Which of us shall go to die for our masters ? " The six wept , and one who had a position of leadership finally pointed and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steeled himself for his ordeal . First he moved to the leader who had named him and rubbed noses with him , signifying that he went to his death with no hatred . Then he rubbed noses with the other two men , saying to each , " It is better that of the two of us I should die . Between you and me , good friend , it shall be I. " Butwhen he came to the second woman , whom he loved , and when he rubbed noses with her for the last mournful time , he could not speak , and he marched from her to the pit , where he was thrown in , with the stones crushed down upon him , and where earth was pounded about him and over him , and where in silence he met dark death . When the consecration of the temple was completed , and when mana had again begun to flow from the gods into King Tamatoa , so that he could function as king , Tupuna organized his second expedition , and with all save four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper into the unknown in search of food . It was not a productive journey , for there was almost no food available . They did come upon a fern whose inner core was just barely edible , and to the fern Tupuna said , " Oh , secret god of this sweet fern , we are hungry . Allow us to borrowyour trunk , and we will leave the roots so that you will grow again . " 1They came upon a taller tree than any they had known in Bora Bora , and Pa observed : " One tree like that would build a house , " so Tupuna reverently prayed , " Mighty tree , we need your wood to build a house . Please let us borrow your strength . See , I plant at your roots a rich ulua for you to eat , and when you are finished , may we come and use your wood ? " If they did not find food , they did come upon something almost as good : a cave well up from the reach of the sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ulua and prayed : " Gods of this cave , please take away any dark things you have left hiding here . Allow me to sprinkle holy water that this place may be sanctified . " Then he entered and called back : " This will be our home . " At this point there came a shout of laughter from the shore , where the pigs had been turned loose , and it was obvious that the old boar still had sea legs , for he would take a few steps , wait for the canoe to surge beneathhim , adjust his legs to meet it , and then fall snout-first into the sand . Looking dazed , he would grunt loudly and adjust his wobbly legs for the next roll , only to fall on his face again . The watchers roared with glee and forgot the haunting uncertainties that perplexed them , for the infuriated hog brought them the therapy of laughter . so that when Tupunai , lH A W A I I 102 103 From the Sun-Swept Lagooncried , " Move everything to the cave ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , threatening all of them , that in their new home there might be no food . But when they got to the cave with their burdens , two farmers reported : " There are many birds on this island , good ones , " and as if to prove this claim , overhead flew a line of terns , which ate clean fresh fish , so that when baked they tasted like delicious chicken and bonito , mixed . Tamatoa , looking at the terns , said , " Tane would never have brought us here if there were no food . It may not be the food we have known , but it 's here . Our job is to find it . " Now , with the temple established and the gods at home , with the great canoe properly beached , and all treasures stowed in the cave , the hungry men who had completed this long voyage began to look at their women , and one by one the emaciated but handsome girls of the long black hair were led into the bushes and cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was launched on the island . But of the women , the fairest could not find her man , for Teroro was brooding by the sea , reflecting on the sacrifice of the slave and its dark portent for the new homeland , so Tehani left the cave and walked down to the sea , crying in vain , " Teroro , Teroro ! " until Mato , who so far had no woman of his own and who had sat close to Tehani all the way north , thus seeing her in many lights and appreciating her quality , heard her and ran through the woods until he could , as if by accident , encounter her along the shore . " Ca n't you find Teroro ? " he asked casually . " No . " " Perhaps he has important business , " Mato suggested . " Where ? " Tehani asked . " I do n't know . Maybe . . . " He took Tehani 's hand and tried to lead her back into the trees through which he had just run , but she pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a chief 's daughter and a chief 's wife . " " Are you Teroro 's wife ? " Mato chided . " What do you mean ? " she demanded , her long hair flashing across her delicate breasts as she turned her head sharply . " I sat very near you on the trip , Tehani , " Mato explained . " It did n't look to me as if Teroro thought of you as his wife . " " I was tabu , " she explained . " But thinking of you was n't tabu , " Mato said . " Teroro never thought of you , Tehani . I did . " He took her hand again , and this time she held on to the rugged young chief , because she knew that what he said was true . " I am very alone , " she confessed . " Do you know what I think , Tehani ? I think you will never be Teroro 's wife . I think he is hungry for his old wife Marama . " Since Tehani shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly drawn toward Mato and allowed him to pull her into the dark glade away from the shore , and to slip her leafy skirt from her , until in her nakedness she looked at him and realized how desperately she wanted this young man who did not reject her ; and he , looking for the first time at her exquisite beauty , diminished though it had been by the voyage , felt a pang of sorrow that such a girl should have been given to a man who did not want her . Gathering her in his arms he whispered , " You are my woman , Tehani . " But when she actually felt his body against hers , and when she heard his words , she grew afraid , for she knew that she was not his woman , and she broke away and ran back to the beach , adjusting her skirt as she went . Before Mato could overtake her she saw Teroro and ran up to him , crying nervously , " You must make peace with your brother . " And she led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mato stood bitterly watching her , and onto the plateau where King Tamatoa surveyed the rude temple . At first neither man spoke , but Teroro , looking over his brother 's shoulder , could see the ominous stones resting on fresh earth . He was dismayed but said grudgingly , " This is an appropriate temple , brother . Later we will build a better . " The king nodded , and it was then that Tehani of the long tresses and the flashing eyes led her bewildered husband into the darkness , knowing in her heart that it was another who should have accompanied her . The sexual life of the king was much too important to be conducted in darkness and hidden glades , so on the next day , after the fishermen had brought in their first substantial catch and women had boiled their unpromising pandanus drupes , Tupuna announced that his wife Teura had ascertained that the time of the month was propitious and that their king , Tamatoa , would that afternoon lie with his wife Natabu . That grave and stately woman was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been secluded , and a temporary shelter , made of cut saplings stuck into the ground and covered with the most consecrated tapas , was erected according to ancient custom . When the tent was completed , sedate Natabu , who rarely spoke and who was , by a peculiar combination of omens and good circumstances , the most holy of all the voyagers , was blessed by Tupuna and led into the nuptial area and placed according to ancient custom upon the woven mats . The king was then blessed , and the entire company , includingeven the five slaves , surrounded the tapa house and chanted , Then , with the prayers and blessings of all the community , the king was taken to the sanctified house , placed inside by the priest , and hidden by the lowered tapa . At this point the prayers mounted in frenzy . The woman with whom the king lay was his sister Natabu . It had been discovered anciently in the islands that for a king to breed a proper heir to the throne , one who would combine the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his full-blood sister , H A W A I I 104 105 From the Sun-Swept Lagoonand although both Tamatoa and his sister Natabu might later take other spouses , their principal obligation was the production  --  under circumstances of the most intricate propriety , and under the surveillance of the entire community  --  of royal descendants . " May the union be fruitful , " old Teura chanted as her niece and nephew lay inside the tapa tent . " May it produce strong kings and princessesblessed with godlike blood . " The crowd prayed : " May this union produce for us a king , " and although they had prayed thus on occasion in the past , when the nuptial tent had been raised over Tamatoa in hopes of breeding an heir , they had never prayed with equal fervor , for it was apparent that in a strange land an heir of the most impeccable lineage was essential , for who else could represent them before the gods if Tamatoa died . In the late afternoon , when the king and his sister left the rude tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chants continued , and all prayed that a good thing had been accomplished on that auspicious day . When the nuptial tent was taken down and all omens pertaining to it examined , King Tamatoa faced another major obligation , for he was led by Tupuna to a field into which the farmers had diverted a small stream . This would become the taro bed upon which the community would dependfor its basic food , and already the mud walls surrounding it imprisoneda foot of water , making the bottom of the field a deep , soft mass of mud . Standing at the edge , where the stream entered , Tamatoa cried , " May the mana of my body pass through my feet and bless this field ! " Whereupon he stepped knee-deep into the muddy water and began trampling the bed . He was joined by Tupuna , Teroro , Mato and Pa , the men with most mana , and for hours they passed back and forth over every inch of the taro patch , hammering the mud into a watertight basin , sealing it with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May this bed be forever sealed . Now plant the taro ! " And according to customs more than two thousand years old , the people planted not only the taro , but the breadfruit and the bananas and the pandanus ; but for no crop were they as fearful of failure as when they planted coconuts , for to a large extent their entire manner of life was intertwined with this extraordinary tree . When the nuts were young they gave delicious water ; when old , a precious oil or a sweet milk . Palms from the coconut thatched many of the houses ; hard shells formed cups and utensils , fibers from the husks yielded sennit . Timber from the trunk was used for building and for carving gods ; the wiry fiber that grew in the crown was woven into fabric ; ribs of the fronds when dried were suitable for starting fires , and sharper ribs , from the leaves , were used in making darts . But most of all , the coconut gave food , and the vocabulary of these people contained twenty-eight different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the time when it contained a just-formed , jelly-like substance eaten with scoops by the old or ill to the day when it was a firm , sweet nut . Therefore , when a coconut was planted , the people placed about the nut a baby octopus to hold the resulting tree erect and prayed : " May the king have done a good job this day . " When the crops were planted , a question arose as to what the island should be named , and the warriors , who knew little of omens , agreed that it ought properly to be called Bora Bora ; but a great surprise was in store for them , for when Tupuna of the ancient mane heard the report he was outraged . " There is only one name for our island , " he announced stubbornly . " What ? " the warriors asked . " Havaiki , " he replied . The settlers were aghast at this suggestion and began to swear that the hated name Havaiki would never exist in their new-found refuge ; and both King Tamatoa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard long and blowing in the breeze , began the most ancient chant of his people , and no interruption of the king could stay him until he had explained , in words more precious than coconuts , for they summarized it the race-experience of his people , and were its soul , who the settlers were : " In ancient times , when great Tane lay with a goddess , the people of the swift canoes were born . They lived then in Havaiki , but it was not the Havaiki we know . It was **25;1485;TOOLONG , and fromthere King Tamatoa 's father 's father 's father , back to forty generations , 11111 led his people in a canoe , and they went to **37;1512;TOOLONG , and there they lived for many generations , until King Tamatoa 's father 's father 's father , back to thirty generations , led his people in canoes to **27;1551;TOOLONG . . . " And in a wild soaring voice he recalled the search of his people , wandering from one land to another , always seeking an island where they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they landed with their burning hopes , they called their new home Havaiki , and if the new Havaiki treated them badly , it was appropriate that they set forth in search of a better , as their parents had done from time immemorial . Thus , in parables , he spoke of the migration of his ancestors from the interior of Asia , to the north coast of New Guinea , through the Samoan islands and out to distant Tahiti ; later men , reconstructing the voyages , would discovermore than a dozen Havaikis , but none closer to the ancient dream than the island about to be dedicated . " For us there is only one name , " the old man insisted in a burst of rhetoric . " Havaiki of the manifold riches , Havaiki of the brave canoes , Havaiki of Qstrong gods , and courageous men and beautiful women , Havaikiof the dreams that led us across the endless oceans , Havaiki that has lived in our hearts for forty and fifty and sixty generations . This is the island of Havaiki ! " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own history , spoke solemnly : " This will be the island of Havaiki , and if youhave evil memories of old Havaiki let it be remembered asHavaiki-ofothers , and it was finally decided that they should , so they went first to old , red-eyed Teura and said , " In the trees we met a strange woman with different hair . . Before they could finish , the old woman burst into a long wail , " Auwe , auwe ! It is Pere ! She has come to destroy us . " The old woman 's husband hurried in and she announced : " They have seen Pere , of the burning fire ! " And when the king arrived at the commotionshe warned him : " The forgotten one has come to punish us . " " Auwe ! " the king mourned , for he perhaps best of all understood the unforgivable error they had committed in abandoning a goddess who had warned them beforehand that she wished to accompany them , and he decided that the entire community must assemble at the temple to pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not uttered , for at this moment the earth began to shake violently . In a manner unknown to the strangers , the red earth of Havaiki rose and fell , twisted and heaved , and cracks appeared through the heart of the settlement , and pigs squealed . " Oh , Pere ! " the king cried in terror . " Spare us ! " And his prayer must have had power , for the trembling stopped , and the horrified voyagers huddled together to decipher this mighty omen . They did not succeed , for a much greater was about to envelop them . From the mountain that reached high above their heads volumes of fire began to erupt , and rocks were thrown far into the air . Scattered ash fell back onto the earth and settled on the king 's head and on the newly planted banana shoots . All day the fires continued , and into the night , so that the undersides of the clouds that hung over the islands shone red , as if even they were ablaze . It was a night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . The settlers gathered at the shore and hovered near West Wind , thinking that if the land caught fire , they might escape in it , and when the eruptions grew worse , Tupuna insisted that the king and Natabu , at least , be sent out to the safety of the sea , and it was because of this foresightthat the colony was saved , for Teroro dispatched Hiro and Pa with the canoe , and when it was a mile out to sea , lighted by the blazing mountain , a great ocean wave sped toward shore , and if the canoe had not already reached the sea , its appropriate element , the onrushing wave would have destroyed it . As it was , the water swept far inland , and tore down the temple and uprooted many of the crops . In its swirling return to the sea , it dragged with it one of the pigs , most of the bananas and old , red-eyed Teura . The goddess had warned her , but she had failed to interpret the dream correctly , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , twisting her this way and that , she was not afraid . Committing herself entirelyto the gods , she whispered into the engulfing waves , " Great Ta ' - aroa , keeper of the sea , you have come for me and I am ready . " As she was dragged across the reef , the green water rushing over her , sheEIAWA . I IFrom the Sun-Swept LagoonRed-Oro , but our land is Havaiki-of-the-North . " So the island was named Havaiki , the last successor in a mighty chain . It was only when Teroro , accompanied by Mato , Pa and three others , had sailed completely around Havaiki , requiring four days for the ex- ploration , that the settlers appreciated what a magnificent island they had found . " There are two mountains , not one , " Teroro explained , " and many cliffs , and birds of endless number . Rivers come down into the sea , and some of the bays are as inviting as Bora Bora 's lagoon . " But it was blunt Pa who summed up what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had picked our cave on the worst land in Havaiki . " Gloomily , Mato agreed ; but King Tamatoa and his aunt and uncle looked at the newly planted crops and at the temple and said stubbornly , " This is where we have established our home " ; but Mato and Pa thought : " If anything should happen , we know where the good land is . " And then the forgotten one appeared . It was on a hot , dusty after- noon when Teroro had gone into the forest seeking birds , that he turned to avoid a tree and found a strange woman confronting him . She was handsome in figure , dressed in a fabric he had not seen before , and her hair , of a strange material that glistened in the sun , stood out like wild grass . She was of his race , yet she was not . With most mournful and condemning eyes she stared at Teroro until he felt his head swimming , but she did not speak . When , in unaccustomed fright , he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped , she stopped ; but always when he paused , she stared at him in reproach . Finally , she departed in silence , whereupon Teroro regained some of his bravery and ran after her , but she had disappeared . When he returned to the settlement , he was shivering , but for some reason which he could not explain he did not confide his experience to anyone ; but sleep did not come to him that night , for he could see the deep-set , fanatic eyes of the woman staring at him in the darkness , so that on the next morning he took Mato aside and said , " I have found some birds . Let 's go into the woods , " and the two young chiefs moved through the trees , and Mato asked , " Where are the birds ? " And suddenly the gaunt , distracted woman stood before them . " Who is this ? " Mato asked , astonished . " She came to me yesterday . I think she wants to speak . " But the woman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wild stare , so that Teroro said to his companion , " When we move , she will move with us . " And certainly , when the war- riors started walking under the trees , she walked with them , her garments disheveled and her strange hair glistening in the sun . Then , as they watched , she vanished . " Where did she go ? " Mato cried . " Woman ! Woman ! " Teroro called , vainly . The two young men consulted as to whether they should advise the H A W A I IFrom the Sun-Swept Lagoonsmiled and was relaxed , for she was certain that somewhere out beyond the coral she would encounter her personal god , Mano , the wild blue shark . " Mano ! " she cried at last . " I am coming to talk with you ! " And she was carried far from land . When dawn rose , accompanied by new explosions of ash and flame , King Tamatoa studied his stricken community , and he could explain the ravages , especially the fallen temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted alive at three of the corners , but Teroro would not tolerate such reasoning . " We are punished because we forgot our most ancient goddess , and because we built in the wrong place , " he insisted . How wrong the place was would now be proved , for Mato came running with the news that up on the side of the mountain a creeping wall of fire was slowly descending toward the settlement . A dozen men went back into the trees and climbed toward where Mato had pointed , and they saw a fearful thing : above them , and marching over all obstacles on its way to the sea , came a relentless wall of fiery rock and molten lava , turning over and over upon itself , devouring trees and rocks and valleys . Its ugly snout , thirty feet high , was not ablaze and seemed dead , until it struck a dried tree , whereupon flames leaped mysteriously into the air . At intervals long tongues of molten rock spurted through the ominously creeping front and spread out like water . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It will be upon us by tomorrow , " the men calculated . When he was satisfied with the news , King Tamatoa reacted without fear , for his brother 's bold words had strengthened him . He commanded : " We will first pray for the old woman Teura , " and he blessed her to the gods . When this was finished he said calmly , " All planted things will be dug up immediately and wrapped carefully , even if you must use your own clothes . " Then he showed the slaves how to load the canoe , and when , at a distance of less than three miles , the molten lava began pouring over a low cliff , like a flaming waterfall , he studied it for a long time . Then he said , " We will stay ashore tonight and get all things ready . In the morning we will leave this place . Pa says he has found a promising land to the west . " Through the night the settlers worked , seeing one another in the dim flares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go . They had recovered much of their seed , and had saved their gods , their pigs and their canoe . With these they escaped , but when they were safe at sea , they saw the vast , fiery front of the lava break through onto their plateau , where it ate its way impersonally across all things . The temple site was burned away in a flash ; the fields where crops had rested were gone ; the taro patch was filled with fire ; and the cave disappeared behind a wall of flame . From the plateau , the cascade of fire found a valley leading down into the sea , and after building its strength aloft , it plungeddown this avenue and poured into the ocean . When it struck the water it hissed and groaned ; it threw columns of steam into the air and explodedthe waves ; it sent noisy reports of its triumph and filled the sky with ash ; and then , conquered by the patient and accommodating ocean , ; t fell silently into dark caverns , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men of Havaiki , seeing for the first time the incredible fury of which their new land was capable , sat awestruck in their canoe and watched for a long time the cataclysm that had destroyed their home ; but a gust of wind , stronger than the rest , carried down from the crest of the volcano a wisp of hair , spun by the breezes from the molten lava , and Teroro caught the hair and held it aloft , where the sun played on it , and he saw that it was the hair which the strange woman in the forest had worn , and he announced : " It was the goddess Pere . She came not to frighten us but to warn us . We did not understand . " His words gave the people in the canoe great hope , for if the goddess had thought enough of her erring people to warn them , she must retain some love for them ; and all was not lost . The hair of Pere was given to the king as an omen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sow , because if this animal did not live and deliver her litter it would be as bad an omen as the volcano . In this manner , but bearing only half the cargo with which they had arrived , and a bred sow clothed in Pere 's hair , the voyagers started for a new home ; and Pa and Mato had chosen wisely , for they led their companionsaround the southern tip of the island and up the western coast until they found fine land , with soil that could be tilled , and water , and it was here that the settlement of Havaiki began in earnest , with new fields and a new temple built without sacrifices . When the sow threw her litter , the king himself watched over the young pigs , and when the largest and strongest reached a size at which he could have been eaten  --  and mouths had begun to water for the taste of roast pig  --  the king and old Tupuna carried the pig reverently to the new temple and sacrificed it to ' lane . From then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tupuna took the . steps which were to give it the characteristics which marked it permanently . He said one day to the king , " Soon I shall follow Teura , but before I go upon the rainbow , we ought to protect the life of  --  ur people . It is not good that men roam freely everywhere , and live ithout restraint . " Teroro , listening , argued : " We had too many restraints in Havaiki-ofRed-Oro . Here we ought to be free . I like our life the way it is . " H A W A l l 110 111 From the Sun-Swept Lagoon " For a few months , perhaps , " the priest argued . " But as the years pass , unless a community has fixed laws , and patterns which bind people into their appointed place , life is no good . " " But this is a new land , " Teroro reasoned . " It is in a new land that customs are most necessary , " the priest warned , and the king supported him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each man lives between an upper , which gives mana , and a lower , which drains mana from him , " Tupuna explained in words that would never be forgotten . " Therefore a man must plead with the upper to send him mana and must protect himself from the lower , which steals mana from him . That is why no man should permit a slave to touch him , or to pass upon his shadow , or to see his food , for a slave can drain away a man 's entire mana in an instant , for a slave has no mana . " The way for a man to obtain mana is to obey his king , for it is the king alone who can bring us mana directly from the gods . Therefore no man may touch the king , or the garment of the king , or the shadow of the king , or in any way steal his mana . To break this tabu is death . " Tupuna then enumerated more than five dozen additional tabus which protected the king in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spittle may not be touched ; his excrement must be buried at night in a secret place ; his food must be prepared only by chiefs ; his reservoir of mana must be protected ; he is tabu , he is tabu . Men with mana required protection from defilement by women , who usually had none . Since men were of the light , and women of darkness ; since men were outgoing and strong , and women intaking and weak ; since men were clean and women impure ; since it was nightly proved that even the strongest man could be slyly drained of his power by a clever woman , dreadful tabus were set about the latter . They must never eat with men , nor see men eating , nor touch food intended for men , on pain of death . Each month they must spend the moon-days locked up in a tiny room , on pain of death . They must eat none of the good foods required to keep men strong : no pig , no sweet fish , no coconuts , on pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been created by the gods to represent man 's fertility , " Tupuna wailed , " no woman may even touch a banana , on pain of instant strangulation . " The days of the moon , the turning of the season and the planting of crops were all placed under tabu . So were laughing at improper moments , certain sex habits , the eating of certain fish and the ridicule of either gods or nobles . Tabu was the temple , tabu were the rock-gods , tabu was the hair of Pere , tabu was the growing coconut tree . At some seasons , even the ocean itself was tabu , on pain of death . In this manner , and with the approval of the people , who wanted to be organized within established levels , the tabus were promulgated and patterns were developed whereby each man would know his level and none would transgress . What had been a free volcanic island , explosivewith force , now became a rigidly determined island , and all men liked it better , for the unknown was made known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were content . One was not . Teroro , as the king 's younger brother , was the logical man to become priest when old Tupuna died . He had inherited great sanctity and was growing into an able if not a clever man ; there was no greater astronomer than he , and it was tacitly understood that he would in time become guardian of the tabus . But he was far from the dedication required for this exacting job . Instead of the equanimity that marked the king , Teroro was torn with uncertainties , and they centered upon women . Day after day , when he wandered in the woods , he would come upon Pere , her shining hair disheveled and her eyes deep-sunk . She said nothing , but walked with him as a woman walks with a man she loves . Often , after her appearance , the volcano would erupt , but what lava flows there were , went down the other side of the mountain and did not endanger the growing settlement , where many pigs roamed , and chickens , and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work well and had produced a son . Only Teroro did not prosper ; often he would turn the corner of a wellknownfootpath , and there would be silent Pere , hurt , condemnatory and yet speaking her love for her troubled young chief . Always , in the background of his mind , there was Pere . Yet his real agony concerned not a shadowy goddess , but a substantial woman , and this was Marama , his wife whom he had abandoned in flora Bora . He thought : " How wise of her to speak as she did on that last day ! " For he could hear her voice as clear as it had been a year ago : " I am the canoe ! " It seemed to him almost godlike wisdom on Marama 's part to have used that idiom ; for she was the canoe . Her placid face and sweet wisdom had been the continuing thread of his life ; over all the waves and through the storms she had indeed been the canoe . And for the first time , here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can remember a strong , placid , wise woman whom he had known before . She was the symbol of earth , the movement of waves , the song at night . Hers was the weight that rested in memory ; her words were recalled . He could see the movement of her skirts , and the way she wore her hair ; once on Bora Bora when he had been sick she had washed his fever and he could recall her cool hands . In consternation he remembered that on the canoe young Tehani had done the same ; but it was different . He had never known with older Marama one fifth of the sexual excitement he had experienced with Tehani ; and yet his mind was tormented by his wife . He would see her at night when he returned from his silent walks with Pere . In his dreams he would hear Marama speak . And whenever he saw Wait-for-the-WestWind , that perfect canoe , he would see Marama , for she had said , " I am the canoe ! " And she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this mood that one morning he dashed from his thatched hut where Tehani slept and ran to Mato , at the fishing grounds . Grabbing the surprised chief by the hand he dragged him to the hut , and jerked Tehani to her feet . " She is your woman , Mato , " he shouted with unnecessaryforce . " Teroro ! " the young girl cried . " You are no longer my woman ! " Teroro shouted . " I watched you on the canoe . Mato never took his eyes from you . All right , Mato , now she is yours . " And he stalked from the scene . That afternoon , in torment of spirit , he sought out his brother and said simply , " I shall go back to Bora Bora . " The king was not surprised , for he had been watching his brother and news of his rejection of Tehani had been discussed with old Tupuna , who had said that Teroro was ill in spirit . " Why will you go ? " Tamatoa asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We need more breadfruit , more dogs , everything . We need more people . " A council was held and all agreed that a trip south could prove helpful , especially if foodstuffs were brought back . " But who can be spared for such a long voyage ? " Tupuna asked , and Teroro replied that he could sail West Wind to Bora Bora with only six men , if Pa and Hiro were two of them . " I 'll go , " Mato insisted , but Teroro growled , " We have treated Tehani badly . You stay with her . " And he would not take Mato , his greatest friend . So the return trip was authorized , and the community began assemblingits pitiful stores of spare food . This time there was no dried taro , no coconut , no breadfruit , no bamboo lengths to carry water . There were , fortunately , some bananas , but they did not dry and carry well . Dried fish there was in plenty , and on this the men would exist . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drawing a rough pattern of the trip north , he pointed out that the canoe had sailed far east , then north , then far west . With a bold line in the sand he cut across this pattern and said , " We will sail directly south , and we will find the island . " " There will be no storm winds to aid you , " Tupuna warned . " We will ride with the currents , " Teroro replied , " and we will paddle . " On the last day before departure , Teroro was sitting alone when one of the village women came to him and said plaintively , " On the return , if there is room in the canoe , will you please bring one thing for me ? " " What ? " Teroro asked . " A child , " the woman said . " Whose child ? " he inquired . " Any child , " the woman replied , adding softly , " It is woeful to be in a land where there are no children . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teroro said so , and dismissed the woman , but in a little while another came to him , saying , " Why should you bring pigs and breadfruit , Teroro ? What our heart ache for is children . " And he sent her away . But the women came again , and while they did not weep , there were tears in their throats as they spoke : " We are growing older , all of us . You and the king and Tupuna and all of us . There are babies , to be sure , but we need children . " " There are no children playing along the shore , " another said . " Do you remember how they played in our lagoon ? " And suddenly Teroro could see the lagoon at Bora Bora with hundreds of brown , naked children in the green waters , and he realized why Havaiki-of-the-North had seemed so barren . " Please , " the women pleaded , " bring us back some children . " Then , on the night of departure , for Teroro insisted upon leaving when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am not going solely for Marama . I am going to bring back the stone of Pere . I think an island should have not only men gods , but women , too . " On the long voyage south , while his men starved and grew parched in the doldrums , Teroro put together the rough chant that would be remembered in the islands for generations after his death and which served to guide subsequent canoes from Tahiti to the new Havaiki : Wait for the west wind , wait for the west wind ! Then sail to Nuku Hiva of the dark bays To find the constant star . Hold to it , hold to it , Though the eyes grow dim with heat . Hold to it , hold to it , Till wild Ta'aroa sends the winds . Then speed to the clouds where Pere waits . Watch for her flames , the flames of Pere , Till great Tane brings the land , Brings Havaiki-of-the-North , Sleeping beneath the Little Eyes . But when the chant was finished , Teroro realized with some dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , and he missed them altogether at first , feaching all the way down to Tahiti before he discovered where he was . Then , beating his way back north , he found avaiki-of-Red-Oro , and there at sea , in the gently rolling swells , the ven men held a council of war . Teroro posed the problem simple : " If we sail into Bora Bora without a plan , the High Priest , who must know about our attack on Oro , will command his men to kill us . " " We 've got to risk it , " Pa growled . El AWAII 114 1 ' From the Sun-Swept Lagoon " We are very weak , " Teroro pointed out . " We can still fight , " Pa insisted . " There is a better way , " Teroro argued , and with a newly developing sense of guile he reasoned : " Since we 're not strong enough to fight the High Priest , we must outsmart him . " And he suggested a way , but his men thought of other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bora Bora and the wild cliffs dropping away to the lagoon . Pa muttered , " We must have been insane to leave this place for Havaiki-of-the-North . " And each man in the canoe acknowledged the fact that he had surrendered earth 's paradise in exchange for a harsh new land . As soon as Wait-for-the-West-Wind was spotted standing off the westernentrance into the lagoon , the residents of its home port began to line the shores and shout with joy at the return of their people . It was this joy that Teroro counted upon to give him ten minutes ' respite to develop his plan , because he believed that the islanders ' spontaneous acceptance of the canoe would prevent the High Priest from ordering the crew 's immediatedeath , and in that interval Teroro would have time to accomplishhis mission . As the canoe neared land he warned his men again : " I 'll talk , but you must look pious . " And promptly the bow of the canoe struck land , he leaped ashore and cried , " We seek the High Priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn , with flecks of white in his beard , approached , Teroro made deep obeisance and cried for all to hear , " We come as servants of Oro , seeking another god for our distant land . Bless us , august one , and send us another god . " The plea took the High Priest so by surprise , coming as it did even before any narration of the journey , that he was unable to mask his pleasure , and the staff with which he could have directed the sacrifice of the crew remained rooted in the ground , and he listened as Teroro spoke rapidly : " Under Oro we have prospered , august one , and our communitygrows . But life is difficult and we live scattered . That is why your servant old Tupuna requires additional gods . When we have borrowed them from you , we will depart . " The High Priest listened , and then stood aside as the new king of Bora Bora appeared , and Teroro saw with intense pleasure that the man was not from Havaiki , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried , " forgive us for our midnight assault on Havaiki before our departure . We did this thing not to dishonor great Oro , but to prevent a Havaiki man from becoming king of Bora Bora . Forgive us . " And Teroro was so weak , and so urgently in need of food and help , that he kneeled in the dust , and prostrated himself before the king , and then before the High Priest , and to his deep satisfaction he heard from the canoe the pious voice of Pa intoning : " Now let us go to the temple of Oro and give thanks for our safe voyage . " But as the men marched , Teroro caught sight of a woman at the edge of the crowd , a tall , solemn , patient woman with a face like a moon , and he thought no more of gods or kings or priests , for the woman was Marama , and solely by looking at each other , intently and with the love that consumes two thousand miles of ocean , she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while he prayed to a god whom he detested , she went to her grass house and started packing . When the prayers were over he joined her there , and they sat in silence , profound communion passing between them , and she was both forgiving and consoling in the disappointing moments when they found him too exhausted with famine even to make love with her . She laughed softly and said , from the edge of the house , " See what happened on the last night we made love . " And she took from a maid 's arms a boy nearly a year old , with wide eyes and dark hair like his father 's . Teroro looked at his son , and at the wife he had left behind because she could bear no children , and in his embarrassment he began to laugh . Marama laughed too , and teased : " You looked so ridiculous out there , praying to Oro . And Pa putting on that long face ! Now let us go to the temple of Oro ! ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . " " What do you mean ? " " Have n't you noticed how much older the High Priest looks ? He has been very badly treated . " " That 's good news . How ? " " After all his scheming to banish you and Tamatoa , so that he could become the chief priest at Havaiki . . . " " You mean , they were just using him ? To subdue Bora Bora ? " " Yes . They had no intention of making him chief priest . After you killed your wife 's father . . . " " She 's not my wife . I gave her to Mato . " Marama paused for a moment and looked at the floor . Quietly , she added , " The men of Havaiki tried to give us a new king , but we fought . " " Then why do you keep the High Priest ? " " We need a priest , " she said simply . " Every island needs a priest . " And they fell silent , listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Teroro said , " You must find a dozen women who will go with us . It 's a hard journey . " Then he added , " And this time we 'll take some children with us . " His voice brightened . " We 'll take the little fellow . " " No , " Marama said . " He 's too young . We 'll trade him for an oleic ! . boy , " and in the island tradition she went from house to house , until she found an eight-year-old boy she liked , and to his willing mother she gave her son . When Teroro saw the new boy , he liked him too , and after the child was sent away to wait for the canoe 's departure , he took his wife in his arms and whispered , " You are the canoe of my life , Marama . In you I make my voyage . " HAWAII 116 117 From the Sun-Swept LagoonAt the consecration of the new idol of Oro , the High Priest insisted upon killing a slave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his men knew that once the reef was breasted , the idol would pitch into the sea , so that when the High Priest delivered the god to the becomingpriestTeroro , the latter took it gravely , not as an idol but as a symbol of the needless death of a man ; and whether he or the crew liked the statue or not , it had somehow become a thing of sanctification , and Teroro treated it as such , for it spoke to him of blood . At the same time it reminded him of the difficulty which now faced him : he had to get the red-rock statue of the goddess Pere from the temple without excitingthe High Priest 's suspicion that that had been the real reason for the return . In secrecy he held council with Pa and Hiro to canvass the ways by which Pere might be kidnaped . Pa suggested : " You fooled the priests with your talk of Oro . Fool them again . " " No , " Teroro replied . " We were able to fool them about Oro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess like Pere would arouse their suspicions . " " Could we steal it ? " Hiro proposed . " Who knows where it is ? " Teroro countered . They discussed other possibilities and agreed upon only one thing : to return to **26;1580;TOOLONG Pere would be insane , for since she had warned them once with such a disastrous wall of fire , the next time she would obliterate them altogether . It was then that Teroro proposed : " I shall talk with Marama . She is a very wise woman . " And it was Marama who devised the plan . " The island knows that you have come back for me , " she pointed out , " and they recall that my ancestors were priests . When the women for our voyage have been gathered , two of us will go to the High Priest and tell him that we want to take one of the ancient Bora Bora gods with us . " " Will he allow it ? " Teroro asked suspiciously . " He is a priest of Oro , " Marama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borah , and he will understand our love of this island . " It worked exactly as she planned , but when the time came for deliveringthe feather-draped red rock of Pere , the High Priest could not bring himself to place such treasure in the hands of a woman , insisting upon transferring the goddess directly to Teroro , and when the latter at last had the soul of Pere in his possession , the wild , passionate soul of the fire goddess , the mother of volcanoes , he wanted to shout in triumph , but instead he lay it aside as if it were only a woman 's god , a whim of his wife 's , and the High Priest thought the same . The men were fattened and the food was packed . Twelve women were selected and put on starvation diets to prepare them for the voyage . King Tamatoa 's favorite wife was included , for everyone agreed that since their king had produced with his sister a royal heir of greatest sanctity , he should be encouraged to import at least one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bananas and breadfruit . " How we yearn for sweet breadfruit , " they explained . When all was ready , Teroro was startled to see Marama lugging toward the canoe a large bundle wrapped in leaves . " What 's that ? " he cried . " Flowers , " his wife replied . " What do we want with flowers ? " Teroro protested . " I asked Pa and he said there were no flowers . " Teroro looked at the other crew members , and they realized for the first time that Havaiki-ofthe-Northowned no natural blooms . Even so , the bundle seemed excessivelylarge . " You simply ca n't take that much , Marama , " he protested . " The gods like flowers , " she replied . " Throw out one of the pigs . " The idea was so offensive that the crew would not consider it , but they did compromise on this : they would put back one of the smaller breadfruit , but they all considered Teroro 's woman demented . Then came the task , most joyous and exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to take only girls , while the women wished only boys , so that the compromise of half and half pleased no one but did have certain sense to commend it . The ten children selected ranged from four years old to twelve : dark-haired , deep-eyed , grinning . whitetoothedchildren . Their very presence made the canoe lighter . But when all had stepped aboard , Teroro was unaccountably depressedby the gravity of the task he had undertaken , and this time with no guile he went gravely to the High Priest and pleaded : " Bless our journey . Establish the tabus . " And the High Priest arranged the gods on the side of the voyagers and cried in a high voice , touching the food for the animals , " This is tabu ! This is tabu ! " And when he had finished , the canoe somehow seemed safer , and it set forth for the long voyage north . It had barely escaped from the lagoon when Pa , the shark-faced , went for the offensive statue of Oro , to throw it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " It is a god ! We will place it reverently on the shore of Havaiki-of-Red-Oro , " and when he had led the canoe to that once-hated island , slipping ashore where no lookouts could intercept him , he placed Oro in a sheltered position among rocks , and built a palm-leaf canopy ; and he was overcome with the awareness that never again would he see Havaiki , from which he had sprung , and while the canoe waited , he stood on the shore of the ancestral island and chanted the story of the brave , lost people of Havaiki-in-Asia , who had set out upon innumerable voyages , never to return . This was his land , his home , and he would know it no more . Pa and his rugged crew were further surprised when it came time to set the course back to Havaiki-of-the-North . This time Teroro would not permit them to follow his earlier reckless path far out to sea ; he required them to take the cautious route to Nuku Hiva , where in all prudencethey replenished their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate food and water , especially for the children , who suffered intensely in the heat , for try as they might , they could not make their stomachs into tight hard knots . They were hungry and they said so . At last the stars of the Little Eyes were overhead , and the canoe turned joyously westward before the wind . Now Teroro conducted daily lessons for every man and boy aboard the canoe : " You know the island lies ahead . What signals will prove the fact ? " And every male above the age of six became a navigator , and Marama , taking the place of old redeyedTeura , became the seer , collecting omens ; and one day a boy spotted a black fork-tailed bird attacking a gannet , who had caught a fish ; and Teroro showed all how to read the wave echoes as they bounced back from unseen Havaiki ; but the most solemn moment came when Marama , reading her clouds , saw fire upon them , and she knew that the goddess Pere had lighted a beacon for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Teroro directed his canoe . As the craft neared shore Teroro faced one last odious job , but he discharged it . Moving among the men and women he told each : " The children are no longer yours . They must be shared with those on shore , and each child shall have many mothers . " Immediately a wailing set up , for on the long voyage men and women in the canoe had grown inordinately attached to the children , and the wild young things had found mothers and fathers whom they liked . " He is more than my son ! " a woman cried , holding to her breast a nine-yearoldboy with a broken tooth . " No , " Teroro said firmly . " If it had not been for the women on shore , pleading for children , I would not have thought to bring any . They must have their share . It is only just . " So when the canoe landed , there was a moment of intense anguish as the women from shore , too long without the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly by the mast and the little girls holding onto men 's hands . The women on shore could not see the new pigs or the promising breadfruit or the bananas . All they could see were the children , and when the first child stepped ashore , a woman ran frenziedly to him with food , but the child drew back . It was in this manner that Teroro , bearing in his hands the rock of Pere , stepped ashore to become the compassionate and judicious priest of Havaiki , with his gentle wife Marama as associate and seer , and with the volcano goddess as his special mentor . The pigs and the breadfruit and the children increased . Marama 's flowers burst into brilliance . And the island prospered .

He could hear his grandpa cursing fearfully in his pain , the curses intermingling with the labored breathing and the snores. chapter 6Lilian Price drove her son to college , a distance of one hundred fifty miles , in the Model-A Ford . Craig Price was nearly sixteen years old , and was wearing brown knickerbockers and white tennis shoes . In his pocket was an old , heavy-gold , hunting-case watch , the only legacy that old Sam Price left . His cowlicked brown hair fell over his right eye , and he had not quite lost his baby fat . But he smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted his first real drink of whisky that summer , at the beach . He had fallen in love three times that summer , with girls named Mary , Fuzzy , and Helen . He had thrown up front the whisky , and had been regarded as a child by girls named Mary , Fuzzy , and Helen . His sacred love , Jane , nearly ten years older , had married an elderly gentleman who was at least thirty-five years old . Since he had been unsuccessful with three profane loves and one sacred love Craig Price was off women permanently . Girls , he reckoned , were no damned good , and that included his mother , Lilian , who was saying as she deposited the boy in front of the Administration Build-ing : " You 're on your own , now , son . The tuition is paid for the firstquarter , and you 've got fifty dollars cash money . We 'll have to figureout something for next quarter . Maybe your daddy can make a turn . But I have to go back to Kensington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss was succinct , as one shakes hands politely with a stranger. 40Mother Lilian wheeled the Ford around on the loose gravel and went away to  --  what ? Craig looked after the departing car with a feeling of relief . There would be , now , no more lectures on the horrors of sex . He felt himself born again , free at last , with his one jazzy college suit of long pants for Sundays only , his one other pair of shoes , his BlueblackedSpeller that old Sam Price had bought him , his gold watch , his half-dozen shirts and a sweater , his razor for the already-heavy beard , and his tragic emotional past behind him . He sighed deeply and looked around him at The University . The University sat on a high plateau in the center of the state , and it was the oldest State University in America . It was located in a place called Chapel Hill , North Carolina , stretched somewhere between Durham , where Duke University is , and Greensboro , where all the pretty girls were .

The trees were turning , but the enormous sward of grass was still green . The mellowed stoneand-brickbuildings and the sharp white of the fraternity houses , with their Doric and Corinthian colonnades , dominated a town which owned one main street and was dedicated simply to education and its by-products . Mr. Botts , the bootlegger , had not yet been discovered by Craig , Russ Columbo had not yet shot himself in an accident , and Mr. Crosby was just beginning to give " Where the Blue of the Night Meets the Gold of the Day " a real thrashing on a radio program which professedto sell a cigar in which human saliva was not a principal ingredient . " Love for Sale " had just been banned from the air as indecent , and Nancy Carroll was the prettiest thing in show business . It was the fall of 1931 , when nobody in the world seemed to have any money . At the time Craig Price had not heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Babe Ruth , and Russ Columbo . He knew the son and daughter of the former President of the University , Harry Chase , because they had summered in his precinct , but the new president , Frank Graham , was as unknown to Craig as Einstein . All Craig Price knew was that he was at a strange stage in his life called College , and that his mother had left in a graveling flurry of wheels , his grandpa was dead , and his father was broke . And that he , Craig Price , Captain-Admiral of the Ocean Sea , was in a very strange Ocean Sea . He signed the necessary papers and received the necessary instructions for a week-long matriculation , and passed through a pleasantly green quadrangle where some overdeveloped youths were playing touch football , and entered his dormitory , a huge , **32;1637;TOOLONG , which smelled rather like a locker room , where he was41directed to Room 112 . The dormitory contained a miniature post office , a sort of commissary where candy bars , Cokes , peanuts , and chocolate milk were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right to play games and who were employed to salve the conscienceof the people who were working off the mortgage on the stadium . The room contained a table , two beds , no bath , two straight chairs , and a madman . The madman was more or less seven feet high , a burly fellow of pleasant aspect . If you had to pick a roommate , Craig thought immediately , this is the kind you 'd look for . The man was blond , sunburned , with ingenuous blue eyes , and short-cropped hair . He was tremendously thewed . He smiled , showing an expanse of very white teeth . He shook hands cordially and announced himself as one Brown . " Come in , " he said . " Looks like the registrar has stuck us into this hole together . I 'm George Brown . I flunked out of divinity school in another college , but I am one hell of a line basketball player .

' Where 'll I stow my gear ? " " Stow your gear ? " " Put my stuff . " " Over there . In that closet . You have n't got very much , have you ? " " I got enough . " Brown got up and snapped the bolt on the door . Ile watched Craig unpack his sparse belongings . Then he jumped up on one of the beds , and his head nearly touched the ceiling . " Where do you come from ? " he asked . " The coast . Kensington , down on the east coast . Where do you come from ? " Brown 's pleasant , healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guess , " he said .

" From up there . I 'm here on a Mission . You do n't really know Who I am ? " " Brown , you said , " Craig answered , completely bewildered . " That 's who you said you were .

From time to time I am God Almighty , so I have the power to change Me into other people .

My Father 's house has many mansions , and my Father 's face has many forms . Today I am Abraham . The burning bush has told me so . " He jumped off the bed and stalked the boy . His hands were hooked , held low , and white showed over his pupils . Saliva dripped from his mouth , and he worked his lips as if savoring a delicious morsel of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Abraham , benched !

The boy and the man circled the room , the man now reaching out his hands in the same leisurely fashion in which he would seek a savory he is as yet unwilling to eat , saving the best for last . The boy continued to scream , while staying just away from the groping hands . As Craig darted away from the hands he shoved the closed window with his shoulder , breaking the glass , and screamed louder . " Help ! " he y tiled , his newly found man 's voice breaking into falsetto . " Help ! He 's trying to kill me ! Help ! Help ! " He scuttled round the room , dodging , once kicking out at Brown 's legs , another time feeling his shirt rip as the hands groped almost blindly at him , and the maniac'svoice suddenly turned bland , soothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the voice said .

" There was a thunder of feet outside . Shoulders hit the door . Craig continued to circle , and continued to scream . More shoulders hit the door , which burst inward just as the maniac had the boy penned in a corner of the room . Half a dozen burly men leaped on Brown and knocked him to the floor , where the madman thrashed enormously until someone kicked him in the head . He lay , his lips froth-bubbling. his great chest panting sobbingly . Four men sat on him . One looked up . " Who 're you , kid ? " " Craig Price . I 'm his roommate . He 's crazy .

I always knew this guy was nuts , " nodding at Brown . Brown raised his head . " Bust him , " the man said . " What with ? " one of the other men said . " Christ , Webster 's Dictionary , your foot , anything ! We ca n't sit on him all day ! " " Hold him down a minute , " one of the men said . " You got anything heavy , kid ? " " No , " Craig said . " Not that I can think of . " The man looked around the room . There was a flashlight on Brown 's table . " He wo n't need this where he 's going , " the man said . " They ai n't allowed in Dix Hill . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struck the maniac repeatedly at the base of the skull . The maniac slumped . " Drag him out , " the man said . " Somebody call the cops , and somebodyelse call the Dean 's Office , and sombody else call the coach . You all right , kid ? " " I guess so , " Craig said . " Is this guy really crazy ? " " IIc 'll do , " the man said . " He 'll do . My name 's Jimmy Wilbur . Most people call me Moose . I got a spare bunk in my room . You want to come spend the night with people who ai n't God ? " " No , thanks , " Craig said . " I think this semester I 'll maybe room by myself , but thanks all the same . " The man smiled . He was a tall , redheaded , compact man , with friendly gray eyes . His nose had been broken more than once , and his hips were so slim that his shoulders seemed deformed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . But if you have any more trouble , half the jockstrapscholarships of this school live down the hall from you . I run the store , and we got credit , when needed . Now let 's get this son of a bitch out of here , " he jerked his head toward the unconscious man . Then he smiled again . " How old are you , kid ? " " Fifteen , " Craig said , and suddenly squared his shoulders . " Going on sixteen . " " I think you 'll make it , " the big , lean , compact man said . " If you need any help , just holler . " " What did you say your name was again ? " Craig almost blushed . " This was sort of mixed up . " " Wilbur . Jimmy Wilbur . Moose Wilbur . " " Oh , my Lord , " Craig said . " You 're not the . . . the All-American ? " 44 " So says Grantland Rice , " the big man said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else , yell , because all us animals are right down the hall in this zoo . But what a hell of a way to start off a college career . Worse than mine . " " Where did you start yours ? " Craig murmured , feeling suddenly very faint . " In a coal mine outside Scranton , Pennsylvania , " Jimmy Wilbur said . " And my last name ai n't Wilbur . It 's a name with a lot of z 's in it . Good night , kid . Come on , you guys , " he said , " let 's get this nutty professionalathlete out of here and let the kid get some sleep . " They dragged the still-unconscious Brown out of the door . Craig closed and bolted the door , and then he lay down on the bed and really began to sob . Grandpa Sam Price seemed a dreadful distance away , as far as heaven , as long as eternity . He went to the closet , took the watch out of his pants ' pocket , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him wet-faced off to sleep . The next day he got up and went to the gymnasium to register , at the same time his first roommate was being taken in a strait jacket to the insane asylum in Raleigh . And that night , after the sweltering sign-posted registration day in the Tin Can , he had a fresh roommate , newly in from Paris . The roommatewas wearing a furry fedora hat , and his name was Philip . Philip had a rather small , heart-shaped face , with a tiny rosebud mouth and an air of great sophistication . his clothes differed from the popular John Held , Jr . model , which embraced twenty-four-inch trouser cuffs , peaked lapels on a bottom-freezing jacket , a shirt dragged down past the Adam 's apple and anchored by an enormous lump of necktie . At a time when young bloods wore painted slickers and drove raddled jalopies with slogans such as " flit Me Easy , I 'm Getting Old " on the back , young M. Philippe duFresne 's fuzzy Italian fedora , black corduroy suit with narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , coming just after the madman 's introduction of Craig to College Life . " Moi , je m'appelle Philippe duFresne , et je viens de Paris . Zut , alors . Excusez-moi . " He smiled winningly . " I find it so difficult not to speak in French . I have spent the entire summer in Paris , France , avec ma mere . With my mother . My home is in Charleston , South Carolina . We live on The Battery . " He pronounced it " Bottery , " and seemed to expect applause . " My name 's Price  --  Craig Price . I come from not so far from you . Kensington , North Carolina . But we do n't speak much French there . " " My mother is a widow , and very rich , " Philippe duFresne said . " And the most beautiful woman in the world . " " That 's nice . My mother ai n't very pretty and we 're as poor as church mice . " " Quel dommage , " Philippe said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " 45 " No . I 've never been anywhere . Is it nice ? " Phillippe rolled his eyes ecstatically . " Magnifique . But wonderful . The women  --  ahh . Magnifique . I caught the clap in Paris , " this with great pride . " You caught the clap ? " " Alors , oui . It was nothing . No worse than a bad cold . We say in Charleston a man is not a man until he has caught the clap , screwed a nigger , and gone with a woman who is having a monthly . " Craig was aghast . " H-how old are you ? " he asked timidly . " I am nearly eighteen , " said M. Philippe duFresne of Charleston , South Carolina , and Paris , France . " Also I am a man . The lady who gave me the dose was not French , however . She was English , and her name was Iris March . I shall never forget her . She always wore a green hat . She has given me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " " A writer ? " Craig was overawed  --  overawed by the extreme age of his new roommate . " What have you written ? " " Oh , little things  --  les petites c  --  hose 's . But I am working on a novel now , a novel called Barbellion . I have the title from two words  --  barbarianand rebellion . Which bed is mine ? I must stay in this beastly place until I am chosen for a fraternity . Stupid rules . " " Over there  --  unless you 'd prefer the one I slept in last night ? " " ' To a man a bed is a bed . It is only who occupies the bed with you that is important . Excuse me . I shall go and tell the chauffeur to bring my bags . " The grand stranger departed , and Craig shook his head . A maniac and a French-speaking novelist in rapid succession were a little too rich for a country boy . Presently , Philippe returned , followed by a chauffeur carrying expensive leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all until your trunk arrives , Mr. Philip , " he said . He touched his cap . " Would you be wanting anything more ? " " No , Graves , that will be all for now . You 'd better get back to the Inn and sec if Marmot needs you for anything . " The chauffeur touched his cap again . " Thank you , Mr. Philip , " he said , and went out . " Decent chap , Graves , " Philip said , extending a package of cigarettes . " Smoke ? " " Thank you , " Craig said , taking a fat , gold-tipped cigarette from a strange box . " What are these ? " " Ahdullahs , " said the exotic stranger . " Egyptian . I never smoke anything else . " " Do you always travel with your own chauffeur ? " To Craig , a chauffeur was somebody who drove an aged banker or maybe the head of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad around . " It 's a bloody bore , really , " said Philippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . " But the mater was obsessed with the idea of seeing me installed correctly in the University . Frankly , theold girl 's between affairs right now and is rather more bored than not . " " Between affairs ? " " But of course . Since my old boy did a bunk  --  took off with some shocking tart  --  one ca n't blame poor old Mum for finding a bedfellow from time to time . The last one was a bit sticky though . An Italian . Greased his hair and wore a dreadful perfume . What the mater saw in Rafaele I ca n't say . Told her as much , and she confiscated my allowance for a month for being rude . Turned out I was right , too . Rafaele married some frightful peasant after he 'd milked poor old Mum of the best part of a year 's income . I told her I did n't mind her spending her money on her boy friends , but when she started holding up my allowance I was going to squawk to the trustees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Call me Phil . A beggar 's pittance , only until I 'm twenty-one . A lousy hundred a month  --  plus expenses , of course , But then I write checks . They are n't any good half the time , but the lawyers always make them come right somehow . Do you drink ? " " A little bit . Not much . Do you ? " " Gallons . Never travel without a flask . Here . Have yourself a tiddly . " Philippe produced a handsome pigskin flask , silver-mounted , a long , thin flask of quart capacity , from his inner breast pocket . " Had a spe- cial pocket made to hold it . It 's French cognac . Best drunk neat . " Craig tipped back his head and took a long pull at the flask . His eyes watered , but he fought down an impulse to cough . Philippe gave him a look of near admiration . " How old are you ? " " Nearly sixteen , " Craig said . " You drink like you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Craig drawled . " I was weaned on Carolina corn . I had my first suger-tit dipped in white lightnin ' . " " I think maybe you and I will get along pretty good , " Philippe said , now crossing the Atlantic and speaking a Charleston version of Eng- lish . " Look . I 've got a date "  --  he pronounced it " day-et "  --  " with the old lady . Would you like to come along and meet her at the Inn ? She 'll feed us. " " 1 'd like to , but I have n't got anything to wear . . . " " You must at least have some long pants ? " " I have . Look . " He went over to the clothes closet and took down his other suit , the Sunday one . It was the snazzy plaid number with the twenty-four inch pants cuffs , and it had cost $18.75 , tailor-made , at Solomon 's . " Jesus Christ , " Philippe said . " The old lady 'd faint if you showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're about the same size . Wear one of mine . " " I ca n't . She 'd know immediately it was one of yours . " " The hell she would . I bought a flock of stuff before we left Lon-4746don  --  not even paid for yet . She has n't seen anything in the biggest bag . Let 's look . " Craig had never seen such clothes  --  tweeds , flannels , broadcloths , sports jackets with complementing slacks . There seemed an endless family of hand-carved shoes  --  treed with oaken inserts , and Craig had never seen a shoetree before . There was a special vault for neckties , richly confected of names Craig had never heard  --  foulard , rep , pique , satin , and all the varieties of silk and wool and knit . " Good Lord , " he said in awe . " I never knew anybody had so many clothes . " " Wait'Il the trunk comes , " Philippe said . " This is just my traveling stuff . Which suit d' you fancy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would it  --  would it be all right if I wore the gray flannel ? " " It 's yours . But you better wear that maroon knit tie with it against a white shirt . And black shoes . " Craig 's eyes dropped . " I 'm afraid I 've only got brown , " he said . " Maybe I just better not go . . . Or go as I am . " " The hell with that . I would n't take you to meet a whore dressed the way you are . The old lady is awful particular . Here , try on some shoes . We 're about the same size all over . " Craig dipped into the shoe compartment , and chose a pair of black calf oxfords . He looked at the soles , and they were as pale as a Negro 's palm . " You never had these on , " he said , almost accusingly . " Never had time , " his new roommate said . " Had the British bootmakerturn out a whole litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tit you . " Craig took off his tennis shoes and tentatively inserted a foot . " Too tight , " he said . " Sorry , but they 're too tight . " " Hell 's delight , " Philippe said . " Of course they 're too tight . Those socks you 've got on weigh more than the shoes . Here . ' l'ry these socks . " He chose a pair of almost transparent black silk socks and slipped them at Craig . " French silk , " Philippe said . " Feel better than a piece of ass . " Craig slipped his feet into the socks , and the feet went into the shoes as if greased . He laced one and then the other , and stood up . " Feels like I 'm wearing gloves on my feet , " he said . " Jolly good , " Philippe said . " Long as I 'm outfitting you try one of those Italian silk shirts with that red tie . I imagine you have your own underwear ? " " Now wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ 's sake do n't be so touchy . I was just joking . All I want is for you to make a good impression on the old girl , so maybe48she 'll ask you home for the Christmas holidays . We have a lot of fun in Charleston around Christmas , and the poontang . . . ahhhh . " Philippewinked viciously . " We . got hotter pants in Charleston than in Paris . And less clap . " Craig felt vaguely uneasy . But he dressed , slowly , in his borrowed plumage , and for the first time in his life experienced the sensuality that comes with the snug of good cloth around the shoulders , the braced hang of artistically tailored trousers , the cool feel of silk on his torso , and the stroking luxury of shoes that felt lighter than socks . He walked outside to the lavatory , damped his cowlick down , and smiled at his neat maroon knitted tie . He walked back to the bedroom . " Bis , Ns ! " Philippe applauded . " Behold the boulevardier ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't they ? " " Nobody 'll mistake you for sixteen , son , " Philippe said . " You look nearer twenty-one . " " It 's my whiskers , " Craig said . " I was born with a beard . " Philippe stroked a nearly hairless face . " My one big desire is to grow a mustache . Come on , I 'll change now , and we 'll go press a call on Ma . Except we do n't call her Ma , or Mama , or Mother . We call her Julie . " " Her name 's Julie ? " Craig said , stupidly . " No , her name is not Julie , " Philippe said cheerfully , stepping out of his trousers and kicking them under the bed . " Her name is actually Henrietta . But she does n't look like a woman named Henrietta , so she settled for Julie . It 's a lovely name , and I 'm going to use it in my book , Barbellion . Julie March , after the girl friend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , exactly ? " " It 's a story about the decline of the South , everybody decadent after the Yankees took over . Then . . . hell , I do n't know what then , but I 'll have a lot of sex in it , and some misce  --  some miscegen  --  a lot of screwing between white folks and black folks in it , and one lovely mulatto woman who steals the white hero from Julie March . " " What 's his name , the white guy , I mean ? " " Lesesne  --  possibly Pierre . God knows we have enough Lesesne 's in Charleston . At least I ought to be able to borrow the name . " Philippehad just knotted a dull-gray silk tie against a white voile shirt . He inserted cuff links  --  the first Craig had ever seen , in the double-barreledcuffs  --  and shrugged himself into a dark blue double-breasted coat . " How do I look ? " " Not so good as me . " Craig grinned . " I think your tailor had me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're a fair entry , I 'd say . " Philippe reached for the flask again . " Better have another slug before we brace the Duchess . A bit of tip to you , roommate : call her Madame first , she likes it . And then , when she says : Call me Julie , ' call her Madame Julie . That 's about the time she'll49tell you to call her Julie , seriously , without the Madame , and shortly thereafter she 'll ask you to come and see us for Christmas . " Craig said : " I have n't got any money to go visiting to Charleston for Christmas . I have n't got any money at all . " " Merck alors , " Philippe said cheerfully . " She 'll send the car with the chauffeur to fetch her baby boy home safe and sound . Or better , I 'm working on her to buy me a car . When we get there it 's all on the house . I might tell you one thing else about Julie . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me early  --  and , I 'm told , she got married for cause . " It took Craig another twenty years to realize that what he had mouthed in answer was a cliche . " You mean . . . ? " " Your new roommate is a near-miss , an almost-bastard , " Philippe said gaily . " And I do n't think the man she married had anything to do with me . I look rather like a close friend of the family . My proper old man was a clot . I imagine Julie used him as a convenience . " " Well , goddamn , " Craig said . " Nobody ever told me college would be like this . Last night my first roommate went crazy on me and tried to kill me . And today I got a new roommate who is an almost-bastard and who caught the clap in Paris , France . " " And who is a liar , too , " Philippe said cheerfully . " I never caught any clap in Paris , France , or London , England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a virgin . Are you ? " " Yes , " Craig said . " I almost was n't but I am . " Technically I am . " " Maybe we can improve the score , " Phillippe said . " But in the meantime , let 's go knock up Ma . " Craig looked horrified . " What ? " " Not what you think . It 's an English expression . Let 's go and rouse out the old lady . She 'll be patting her foot . " The boys walked down the corridor and out into the street fronting on the Arboretum , heading for the Carolina Inn . They nodded courteouslyto everyone they met , and received very few nods in return . " Friendly sort of place , " Philippe said . " About as friendly as Charleston , if your blood ai n't blue . Another thing : I am not an almostbastard . My old man and Julie were engaged for eighteen months before they were married and I was n't born until fourteen months after the ceremony . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone held wonderment . " Damned if I know , it just seems to be fun . Was it true your roommatewent crazy on you last night ? " " Crazy as a bedbug , " Craig replied . " I do n't lie except when I have to . " " You 're missing a lot of fun , " Philippe said . " Hello , there 's the Deke House . I think I 'll go Deke . What are you going to pledge ? " " Nothing , " Craig said . " I have n't got the dough . Also I ai n't social from Charleston . " " Do n't let it get you down , boy , " Philippe said . " Well , here we are . Let 's go and beard the dragon . " Madame Julie duFresne was indeed patting her foot . " You 're late , " she said . Then , turning her gaze to Craig , " Who 's this ? " " Friend of mine , Julie . My new roommate . May I present Mr.Craig Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went crazy on him after only an hour . This was last night . " " He seems to be in a rut , " Madame Julie duFresne then turned a blinding smile on Craig . " This one has been trying to drive me mad for years . What was your name again ? " " Craig , ma'am , Craig Price . " " Nice name . It sounds strong . How old are you ? " " Fif  --  sixteen years old , ma'am . " " Do n't call me ma'am , for God 's sake . My name 's Julie . " " I do n't think I know you well enough to call you Julie , ma'am . " Madame Julie duFresne shot Craig a swift look . " How old did you say you were ? " " Almost sixteen , ma'am . " " How does it happen you 're in college so early ? " " I skipped some grades , ma'am . " " Look . " Philippe 's mother turned to her son . " For the love of Godexplain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's settle for something less formal . " " How about Madame Julie ? " Craig permitted himself a tiny smile . Madame duFresne looked at him sharply . " As long as you 're rooming with Philip I think that Aunt Julie might n't be too inept . " " How about Miss Julie ? " Craig smiled again . " I 'd feel easier , ma'am . " " Miss Julie it is , and no more ma'ams . You know , I think I like you , Craig Price . " " Even in your son 's suit and shoes and shirt and tie ? " Philippe made a face . He put a finger to his lips . " You did n't have to say that , " Julie duFresne said . " I had n't seen the clothes before . Why did you ? " " I do n't know . I like your son . But he 's a liar . He plays games with himself . He said you would n't like it if I came to meet you in my knickerbockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have . " " Bloody little snob , " Julie duFresne said . " So he got you to wear some of his , did he ? " " Yes , ma'am  --  yes , Miss Julie . We 're about the same size . I do n't know much about this . " 5150White showed over the top of Madame duFresne 's enormous violeteyes . She jabbed at Craig with a long , crimson fingernail . " See here , my boy , " she said harshly , " you go out and tell my chauffeurto take you back to your dormitory , and to wait while you change your clothes into what you were wearing before Maurice Chevalier here came into your life . Then you come back and we will have dinner together , Price Craig . " " Craig Price , ma'am . " " And keep calling me ma'am . I find I like it . In the meanwhile I will have a word with my child . " " Yes , ma'am . " As Craig went to look for Graves , the chauffeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philippe duFresne , was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life . It was not the severe black dress , the double strand of pearls , or the first mink coat he had ever seen . It was not the Parisian shoes or the elegant gloves . It was not even the enormous sapphire eyes in the white face , from which the straight black hair was drawn to make a bun on the nape of her slender white neck , the wide humorous red mouth , and the exquisite figure . It was not even the drawling , faintly accented voice which could sharpen from sugar into razor blades . It was the whole thing , put together perfectlyinto a package that was ready for a grown man to open . Craig wished fleetingly that he was a grown man . " Wait here , please , " Craig said to Graves . " Wait here until I change . " As he stepped out of the beautifully cut trousers and pulled on his knickers Craig Price said aloud : " One day , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one day , I 'll have me some clothes like this . " Ile pulled on a sweater . " And one day , " he said , " I 'll have me a woman like that . One day . And they 'll all be mine . Not somebody else 's . " Wearing knickers , tennis shoes , and a sweater , Craig Price went back to the waiting limousine . " The hotel , please , Graves , " he said , as he was helped into the back seat . " And one day , " he said , " I ' 11 have a better car . " 52chapter 7The trees crisped into violent scarlets and tawny golds , and the footballseason roared off with a bang . The team was good , that year , with a new coach  --  a tough , squat , serious , scholarly man who was paid to win and who won with hired material from the mining areas of Pennsylvaniaand West Virginia . There was n't a Southern accent on the first two strings . The athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig , doubtless because of the violence of his entrance into college . Moose Wilbur , the All-American , seemed especially concerned with the boy 's welfare . " Look , kid , " the athlete said , " part of this deal I got with the school is looking after the store here in Aycock . I have to go to class in the morning and practice all afternoon , and I 'm supposed to hustle a boarding house in the evenings . If you 'd take that afternoon trick in the store for . . . You have n't got any labs , have you ? " " Not until next year , " Craig said . " I 'd be glad to handle the store , Jim . " " Well , if you do , you can at least get your sandwiches and cigarettes and candy free , and maybe knock down a little on the cash . Not much , but enough for a movie . And listen , kid . It 's hard for us to do it and it 's illegal as hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of extra tickets . Good ones , down front around the fifty-yard line . There 's a lot of business to be done just at game time , if you do it right , and careful . Say I got a couple of dozen choice ducats for you every home game , if you could get rid of ' em for a jacked-up price us guys would be glad to split you fifty-fifty . Of course , if you got caught by the University cops we do n't know nothing . You just found the tickets . " " It 's kind of crooked , ai n't it ? " Craig grinned . " Not that I mind . " " It 's no more crooked than the racket we work for , " Jimmy Wilbur said . " I been going to school free ever since some scout saw me playing grammar school ball against Irontown and gave my old man a couple hundred to sign me up . You know I went to Peddle Military Academy first ? I knew every play in this school 's book before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches . " " Why do n't they just pay you a salary ? " Jimmy Wilbur spat , and ground the spittle into the concrete floor with the heel of his shoe . " We 're amateurs , " he said . " We wind the eight-day clock , and jump over the suitcase on a bet , and hustle tickets , and hustle boarding houses , and work in the Student Union , and some old grad picks up53the fraternity dues . We get our clothes free from the College Shop , and somebody like old Ellis down there is representative for Dr. Pepper , and somebody else works in the Smoke Shop , and I tend bar at the commissaryhere , and it 's all a bunch of crap . What makes it mostly crap is that all you can major in is physical education , because you got no time for real study . You got to show up three weeks early for the fall term , and after Christmas , winter practice comes , and then you got spring practice unless you 're playing baseball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a milk route or sawing logs or swinging a pick on a new highway project so you wo n't get soft . So you finally graduate and all you 're fit for is a job as assistant coach in some jerk school somewhere , with the idea that maybe one day you might make as much as $8000 a year as head coach before the alumni get sore and fire you . Amateurs , for Christ 's sake ! Bums is a better word . " He spat again and left the spittle unrubbed . " Come on down to my room , kid , " he said . " I got a bottle of shine . Every time 1 think football I feel like getting drunk . You 're a pretty good kid . Drink ? " " Not much . Some . " " Do n't let it throw you . A lot of guys get lost in the bottle . Come on , let 's go strike a blow for Alma Mater . " Seated on the bunks in Jimmy Wilbur 's room , Craig said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in training , are n't you ? Is n't it bad for you ? " Jimmy Wilbur tipped the half-gallon fruit jar of white corn into a thick water glass . He added a little Coca-Cola and drained half the glass . Then he handed the jug to Craig , before he spoke . " That 's crap , too , like the rest of it . Why would n't I drink ? I sweat enough to lose it . And I can still go on a Saturday . We got enough tame bohunks blocking for me to where I could do it on crutches . I made the official All-American last year . If I do n't look good this year they 'll just fire the coach . That , I 'd like to see . " Craig took a gulp out of his drink . " Where does this come from ? " he asked . " It 's not bad . I had worse down my way this summer . " " Guy down the pike apiece on the Durham road . Hey ! " Jimmy Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got an idea . The campus cop plays left tackle on the first string . There 's a fellow over at Duke , comes from Jersey City , got a connection in the bootlegging business . He 's a nice guy , an Irishman , and his brother is somebody in the New York-Jersey mob . How 'd it be if we sort of went in business together ? He could get the alky from up North . We could put it together here , and start an unofficial agency . You could maybe work the fraternity houses on a steady basis  --  with me for a front , 1 mean . 1 'd take you around to a few of the lodges and we 'd buy the boys a drink , and I 'd let the word drop that this could be steady service . They would n't have to go all the way out the road to pick up a jug . We 'd cut the cop in , 54see , and split the take four ways  --  me , you , the cop , and the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durham guy would have to go for half , and we 'd split the other half three ways . After all , he 's the supply . How 's it sound ? " Craig paused before he answered . He thought about his one suit and the day he borrowed clothes from Philip , his roommate . He thought about the fact that after buying books and paying a month 's board he had less than ten dollars remaining to see him into Christmas . He thought about Sam Price , dying , and what the old man had said in the cowlot . He thought about Philip 's lovely mother and of Philip 's beautiful clothes and shoes . He thought about his gold watch and how much it was likely to fetch in a Durham hock shop . " It sounds just fine , " he said . " When do we start ? But tell me somethingfirst , Jimmy , why are you guys being so nice to mc ? I ai n't any-body . " " I really do n't know , kid , " the athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you got a chance not to wind up smelling like jockstrapsand shower-rooms all your life . I do n't know . " He reached over and punched the boy roughly on the chest . " Maybe it 's just because you 're a good kid with a chance not to be a bum . By the way , how 're you getting along with that pansy roommate you 've got now ? " " All right , I guess . He 's not a bad guy . He 'll be moving out next quarter anyhow . He missed the Dekes , but the Sigma Nus pledged him . He 'll be their big glamor boy . Mama just bought him a green Pierce-Arrow . " " Oh , that 's that big can 1 saw out front . And the dame in it . That could n't have been his old lady ? " " Could , and was . Ai n't she something to have a kid in college ? " " Man . " Jimmy Wilbur 's whistle was reverent . " Why do n't I ever come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to visit them in Charleston for the Christmas holidays , " Craig said . " Mrs. duFresne asked me . She thinks I 'm a good influence on Phil . Philippe , I mean . " " Stand up , son . " Jimmy Wilbur looked at Craig keenly , and set his head to one side . " Mmmm , " he said . " You 'll owe me ten bucks if she do n't . Here 's the bet , paid now . " He handed the boy a ten-dollar bill . " What 's this for ? " Craig held the money awkwardly . He sat down . " Call it a down payment on a suit , " Jimmy Wilbur said . " I might as well pay you now , because I lost the bet . In any case you 'll level with me . " He cleared his throat . " Tell me , kid . You pledging any fraternity ? I 'm a Phi Gam . I could fix it , okay enough . And no dough . Get you something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is funny ? " " Try me and see if I think it 's funny . Shoot . " " Well , hell , Jimmy , I think this fraternity thing is a luxury you ought55to pay for . It 's not a thing you ought to earn , like waiting on tables or selling sandwiches and lemonade at night when the boys make the rounds with the baskets . I been rushed some  --  ATO 's , Pi Kaps , Phi Gams , Phi Delts , Sigma Chis , Sigma Nus  --  everything but the Dekes , the SAEs , and the Betas . But I do n't play football and I 'm not on the publicationsand my old man ai n't governor and I ai n't got a dime unless I make some . I just do n't want to do anything on a free list . Maybe next year if I got some dough . . . . But if not , the hell with it . I do n't want social charity . My old man could n't make it in the Yacht Club back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother me a damn bit , except that it does , but I wo n't let it . You understand any of that ? " " More than you know , son . I 'm on the free list in my lodge , and if they took Grantland Rice 's All-America away from me I could n't get in the door as a janitor . Have you met Brother Wilbur , the All-American ? ' " Jimmy 's voice minced . " What they are saying is that this big Polack is in here for nothing , for free , and if he breaks his leg we 'll start charging him dues . Christ Almighty . " " About the bootlegging . I do n't think 1 like that , either . I came here to learn something not to get kicked out , and we 'd he a cinch to get caught eventually . If nothing else the pros on the Durham road would hear about it and gang us . If they 're anything like the leggers in my end of the state they got a working agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How come you know so much about bootleggers and crooked cops ? A kid like you ? " " Easy enough . My grandpa was sick with cancer a long time , and he drank about a quart a day against the pain . When he got too feeble to go after his own booze 1 went . I knew every bootlegger in Niggertown , and most of the white ones , too . Seems like every time I went after a jug 1 'd run into a cop in somebody 's kitchen . Got so I was hitching rides with them . " Jimmy Wilbur laughed . " It seems to me you know an awful lot for a short-pants kid , " he said . " How about girls ? You ever sample any of that colored poon ? " Craig blushed . " I pretty near did . We had a colored gal named Iris  --  part Indian , part Negro , with a smidgen of white . What we call a Brass Ankle . She was about sixteen and pretty as a picture . This summerI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one day , when my mother went off shopping , I slipped down the stairs in my shorts with something in mind . 1 guess the old lady read it in my eyes , because she cut my trail , circled back behind me , and caught me just as I was making a grab at Iris . " " What did she do ? " " She beat hell out of me with a broom , big as I was . She said , until the day she died any time she caught any of her menfolks messing with the help she aimed to grab a broom and wear ' em out . She would , too. 56She beat me something terrible when I was a little boy for running away from a fight with another boy . She hurt me so bad I went back and beat up the other boy . " " Sounds like quite a woman , your ma . Say , we generally go over to Durham to one of the hotels on Saturday nights . There 's some pretty good gals over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to go , some Saturday ? You ca n't hang onto that cherry forever . " Craig blushed again . " I 'm in love , " he said . " I would kind of like to he true . " " Who in hell are you in love with ? You only been here a month , and there ai n't half enough girls to go around even for the society guys with cars . " " Do n't laugh , " Craig said . " Jean Harlow . " Jimmy Wilbur stared . " That 's kid stuff , that movie star business . " " Not for me it is n't . I sleep with her every night . It 's all I can do to handle her business . " " Are you nuts ? " " No , I 'm not nuts . I 've got a funny kind of brain , though . I can generallydream about what I want to , if I concentrate hard enough before I go to sleep . Ever since I saw Hell 's Angels I been concentrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning I caught her . " " Tell me more , my young friend . This is a piece of scientific knowledgeI 'd like to share . How did you get so chummy with that blond hunk of dame , at your age ? " " Well , a couple of weeks ago I dreamed I had her out in the woods near the lake . We were lying down on the pine needles , and I kissed her . Then she took her dress off . . . " " Does she wear a brassiere , at all ? " " Nope . Not a stitch under that dress . " " Not even pants ? " " Not even pants . Well , I crawled over close to her and was kissing her when the goddam alarm clock went off for my eight o'clock math class , just as I was about to . . . " " That 's a pity . What a pity . " " Wait a minute . I cut off the clock and went back to sleep . And damn ' if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I caught her and caught her good . Of course , I had to cut the class , but it was worth it . " " How often does this happen ? " " Nearly every morning . I reckon I 'll flunk math , but somehow algebrado n't seem so important . " " You telling me the truth ? " Suspiciously . " Hand to God . I 'm even getting her to where she comes to call a littleearlier every day , and I been making the math class for the last week . Not that it 'll save me from a flunk . That X plus Y to the second power do n't mean anything to me . After a session with Jean I ca n't seem to concentrate . " 57 " Boy , you are the goddamndest freshman I ever saw , " Jimmy said . " Come on , let 's have another drink , and then I got to practice . ' Practice ' what ? Something I know more about than the coach ? " " You want me to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? And remember , do n't steal much . Just movie money  --  although why you need it when you 're going steady with Jean HarlowI could n't know . " Craig laughed , throwing his head back . " Who can tell ? " he said . " Some day I may get tired of her and want a change . " Jimmy Wilbur clapped himself dramatically on the skull , and burlesqueda stagger as he tottered off to practice , reeking of moonshine whisky . That next Saturday he ran a punt back from behind his own goal line for the touchdown that beat Duke 7-0 , and also kicked the extrapoint . But when he and a few select members of the varsity went to Durham that night to get their ashes hauled , his heart was not in it . " What 's the matter with you , honey ? " the garishly cosmeticked blond with the whore 's bulging stomach asked him . " Do n't you like me any more ? " Jimmy Wilbur reached for his pants . " It is n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm in love . " " Who with ? One of the coeds , and she wo n't put out ? " " No . Jean Harlow . " The whore stared at him . " 1 think you 're getting punchy , " she said . " All you athletes leave it on the football field . " " You could be right , " Jimmy Wilbur said , making for the door . " Baby , you certainly could be right . " chapter 8Julie duFresne 's house on Charleston 's Battery overlooking the river was hidden from the world by a thick plaster wall . A niche in this wall proved to be an iron gate  --  locked  --  which was opened by a butler in striped working apron  --  an elderly white-haired man with a bulbous nose as deeply pitted as a strawberry . He looked at Philip with a servant'slofty distaste , as he produced an enormous iron key and the gate clanged on its pivot . " Hello , LeBlanc , " Philip said . " We 're home . How is Madame ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good trip ? " " That 'll be enough of that Master Philip business , LeBlanc . I 'm a big boy now . Yes , we had a nice trip . See that the car 's washed . It 's filthy . " " Oui , Monsieur duFresne . " He accented the monsieur . " Madame , votre mere , is having tea in the patio . She asks that you join her after you show your guest to his room and wash up , if you wish . How am I to call this gentleman ? " " Mister Price , " Philip said , as they moved through the formal palmstuddedfront garden , which was encumbered by so much marble statuarythat Craig was reminded of a cemetery . Craig looked at the enormoustile-roofed white house , with its lacy iron-wrought balconies and galleries , presenting a formidable prow toward the river . He wondered why there was no front porch . They moved directly into a dim , broad hall , with a staircase at the far end . A silver bowl of roses rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just past a door which probably led to the sitting room a vast carven chest held an enormous spray of some white flower with which Craig was unfamiliar . Craig 's eyes swept the length of the deep green thick-rugged hallway . At the far end a double entrance of carpeted steps led to a platform which sprouted what seemed to be a hundred yards of stairway . It had no balusters , just enormous handrails bolted against solid white paneling . Only on the next floor did the balusters begin  --  forming a squareendedhorseshoe which extended two-thirds the depth of the house  --  slim white toothpicks topped by the same graceful dark mahogany  --  to make a second hall . This hall gave the same impression of being outof-doors , since enormous earthen pots circled by delicately wrought iron frames contained enormous fleshy green-fronded plants . The walls on the second floor were white , as well , and seemed to possess an infinite selection of doors . Over the stairwell hung a brass candelabra so huge that it covered nearly the width of the hall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the staircase , Philip said : " Where is Mr. Price staying ? " " In the large guest room in Madame 's wing . It is prepared . " " Oh ? " Philip 's eyebrows lifted . He pursed his small mouth in a soundless whistle . " Well , show Mr. Price to his room . I can still find mine by myself . LeBlanc will bring your stuff , Craig . Do n't bother to unpack . He 'll do it after we 've gone to see Julie . Shake it up , son . I can do with a drink . That driving 's thirsty work . " They had come at a tremendous sustained speed in the new green Pierce-Arrow , stopping only for gasoline and a sandwich . Roaring through the countryside in the lean , rakish car was another new experience for Craig . who up to now had only driven a Model-A Ford . It was a phaeton , and the wind rushed past its open tonneau , blowing Craig 's eyelashes back . " Can you drive ? " Philip turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . " Sure . Fords , anyhow . " " This is n't a Ford , boy . This thing 's got enough power under that hood to run a battleship . Want to try her out ? " " If you do n't mind , I 'd love to . I 'll be careful . " " Do n't . It 's the most dangerous way I know to drive a car . You just point her and let her go and she 'll take care of herself . " When they stopped for gas Philip slid out from under the wheel , yawned , stretched , and lit a cigarette . " Take her , " he said . " ' Take her as far as Georgetown , and then I 'll run her on to home . You got any dough ? I do n't think I 've got enough for the gas . She drinks it like it was whisky . " " Yep . " Craig fished into his pocket and came up with a ten-dollar bill . " Here . " " Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a crap game last night and it cleaned me out , almost . " Philip paid the attendant , and absent-mindedly put the change in his pocket . Craig eased the car into gear , and the silky power of the murmuring motors urged the monster into a floating sensation on the taut ribbon of road . The dense trees rushed by and the sky was brilliant blue . His assurance gained , and he gradually let her take the bit . As the Pierce-Arrow roared through the moss-bearded , oak-rimmed road Craig felt a tremendous exultation . " I never been in an airplane , " he said , " hut I bet flying is something like this . What a wonderful car . How much do they cost ' ? " " I du n no , " Philip said , sleepily . " Three or four thousand , I guess . If you do n't mind I think I 'll grab a nap . It was real drunk out last night . " ( Three or four thousand , Craig thought . God Almighty . Just three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name . I wish he 'd have given me the change back , but how the hell can I ask him when it 's his car and his house we 're going to  --  his food and his Christmas ? What do 1 do about Christmas presents ? / got to give his mother something , and I ought to give him something . But God , what a car ! ) As the car flashed along Craig let the corners of his eyes dwell lov- ingly on the rushing scenery . This was his country now , not the high hills stuck in the sandy plains of north and northwestern Carolina , but the low , swampy coast he knew as well as he knew how to train a dog or catch a fish . Even in the wind the smell of salt and marsh ooze was strong . The live oaks and cypress and tall long-leaved pines held the road lovingly close . Only a few Negro shacks , shambling , with tar- paper roofs and sagging walls , stood by the roadside . To the left an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he wished he were going back to New Truro , except that of course he had no place to go in New Truro now that his grandpa 's house had been sold . And oddly , for a boy so young , he felt no urge to see his parents , even at Christmastime . This feeling evidently was reciprocal . When he had written his mother that he was going to Charleston with his roommate for Christmas she had merely written back : " That 's nice . Have a good time . Here 's five dollars . I wish it were more . Love . " Craig let the car out another notch and grinned at his sleeping friend . " At least , " he said to the wind , " I 'm the best-dressed pauper in the freshman class at Chapel Hill , and at this moment I 'm living high on the hog even if it ai n't my hog . " He grinned again , thinking that he sounded exactly like old Sam Price . As they approached Georgetown a small covey of quail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip came awake with a start . " Sorry , Phil , " Craig said . " But some bobwhite had the right of way . " " Where are we ? " " Just about in Georgetown . Damn , this is pretty country is n't it ? " " Too flat . Also they got a paper mill or something in Georgetown that stinks . When we get to the next filling station let 's stop and pee and have a Coke , and I 'll take her on from here . How long was I asleep ? " " ' Bout an hour . I was glad . I was having a lot of fun with this car . I did n't want to talk . " When they had finished the Coke Philip pulled a wad of bills and some silver out of his pocket to pay the attendant . He looked at the bills . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I did n't give you back your change . Why did n't you ask me ? " " I figured you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyhow , I had your car for security . " " You 're a strange one . You got any more dough ? " " Sure , I 'm nigger-rich . Let 's roll . I want to see Charleston . " " You wo n't like it , " Philip said , frowning , as they pulled out of the station . " The only reason Julie and I stay there is the trustees make us , most of the time . If it was n't for that , Julie 'd be in Paris like a flash and you would n't even see the dust . " " Maybe I 'll like it , even if you do n't . I know it 's got a port and ships and colored people and fried fish , and I was raised with ships and coloredpeople and fried fish . I can even speak a little Geechee . Boy , where you get dem rope ? ' Man , I done t'ief um off de dock , yeddy ? ' " " You 'll meet damn ' few Geechees in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as blue bloods , and blue bloods are so proud they do n't speak to each other , even when they 're married . " " I hope I do n't cause you any embarrassment , " Craig said seriously . " About what forks and things . This is my first time away from home , except school . " 60 61 " You wo n't . Julie wo n't let you . " " Excuse me , Phil . Tell me off if I 'm rude . But I get a kind of feeling that you do n't like your mother very much . I mean , you do n't love her like people are supposed to love mothers , and she does n't think of you as a son . More as a . . . a person , sort of . " Philip took his eyes off the road and shot a swift glance at Craig . " I do n't mind talking about it . Julie 's the kind of woman who ca n't let herselfbe a mother . She 's too damn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was n't in Paris or I was home from boarding school  --  to feel that being a mother sort of got in front of her social life . Like I was a nuisance  --  a load she had to carry . " He raised his voice to a mimickingfalsetto . " Poor dear Julie . Stuck first with a roaring drunk and now with that dreadful child . Do you suppose he 'll take after his father ? ' Christ . " Philip 's voice was hitter . " Do you think I like it , to know about all the men I call uncle ' ? Uncle George , the summer gentleman . Uncle Peter , the Cap d'Antibes gentleman . Uncle This and Uncle That  --  one for Easter , one for Christmas , one for Thanksgiving . Ever since the old boy died I have had a succession of uncles I never met before  --  nice slick gentlemen , mostly with mustaches , who pat you on the head and give you presents and say with their eyes that would n't it be nice if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or to Iiell . Any place , so that whatever uncle was around could get down to the business of goingto bed with Mama . " " But your father ? " " Oh he was a great one . He went to a lot of doctors about this great love he had for the jug . The doctors told him he either had to give up whisky or give up his wife . He chose the whisky . I do n't remember him very well , except that my nurse used to tell me to he very , very quiet , because my father was sick . He was sick , all right . Ile was sick all over everything in the house . You ever know a real drunk ? " " Not really . Some of the boys in Truro used to get sweet on a Saturdaybut . . . " " I mean a real drunk , the kind that messes the bed and throws up at the dinner table and falls down all the time . Papa was a real talented one . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stick . Also he had a habit of beating hell out of the old lady . He was a real fine one . And when the stupid bastard finally had sense enough to shoot himself he could n't even do that right . He messed up the job , more or less missed his head , and flopped around the floor for an hour or so before he died . The flies . . . Lovely . " Philip shuddered , and the car swerved . " I 'm sorry , " Craig said . " I did n't mean . . . " " It 's all right . Sometimes I like to talk about it . But when Julie looks at me , she sees Jean-Pierre duFresne flopping around and fouling up the rug with what few brains he had . And when I see her , all I can think of is Uncle George , the summer gentleman . He gave me a poodle62puppy once . I named him George , and I 'm afraid that when they took that puppy away from me they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure . Sorry I brought it up . " " It 's okay . But I think the reason Julie took such a shine to you is that she wished you were me , and that there was n't any me . I more or less resemble the other side of the family . " " Let 's skip it . I 'm sorry I asked . How far are we out now ? " " About half an hour . I did n't mean to saddle you with my troubles . " " Do n't let it worry you , " Craig said . " I got some troubles of myown . " The bedroom was vast . It was obviously a woman 's room . Craig whistled . " Now , I wonder why the hell she put me in here ? " he asked himself , half aloud . He looked about him keenly . It was obviously a lady 's room . An enormous canopied bed domi- nated the room , a careful exhibit of casual elegance . The walls were of a foreign-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the windows the undercurtains billowed in pale yellow silk which shed a golden quality over the room . The draperies and cornice were made of a floral print in the same scheme and were finished with a wide silk fringe . The draperies seemed to be made with white silk lin- ings and interlinings and were too thick , Craig thought . The rug was vast , a light golden carpet that felt fluffy underfoot . Craig had a long look at the bed . The canopy seemed to be very old . This bothered him for sometime until Philip told him later that it was hand-crocheted and had been in the family for umpteen generations . The bedspread followed the draperies in design , but again seemed too thick to be practical . It had been turned diagonally back for the eve- ning and disclosed a yellow silk blanket over embroidered , initialed linen sheets and pillowcases and a tiny baby pillow which seemed to have no actual function . Across from the bed there was a clothespress with two mirrored doors surrounded by intricately carved mahogany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across one wall over which was a portrait of an unsmiling female ancestor . Yellow tulips spilled out of a milk-glass bowl underneath the ancestor . Two armless chairs squatted on each side of a round table which was draped in green velvet to the floor , and whose surface contained two books , a cigarette box , a lighter , a bottle of Scotch whisky  --  the first Scotch whisky Craig had ever seen  --  and a howl of fresh fruit . Next the bed stood a tiny stool which Craig thought must have been put there to help small people jump into the bed . A commode on the other side of the bed held a brass lamp topped with an opaque glass63bowl and seemed established to provide light for the room when the two pairs of gilt sconces on opposing walls were off duty . The bedside table also contained a miniature painting of his hostess done on ivory . Craig thought again how impossibly beautiful she was to be his roommate'smother . There was a fireplace of mottled black marble with a small round opening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplacewas ever used since there were no fire tools and the opening of the fireplace was hidden by a gilt contraption that looked like an open lady 's fan . Craig leered at himself in the gilt convex mirror , which threw him and the entire room into distortion . A round , revolving , rosewood bookstandsat in front of one of the windows . There was also a sort of extra bed which some years later Craig learned was called a chaise longue . " Jesus , " Craig said aloud . " There ai n't no place here to sit down . I wonder if she thought her only child was bringing home a coed instead of me ? " The butler had arrived with Craig 's one valise . " The bath is there , " the butler said , " and if I may say so , sir , she rarely puts anyone here . Shall I run your bath now ? " " If you please , " Craig said . " May I press something for you , sir ? " the butler asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something he would really prefer not to touch . " I do n't think so , " Craig said . " But would you open it up and hang my suits in the closet , please ? " He unconsciously emulated Philip . " Very good , sir , " the butler said . " Thank you , " Craig replied , and went into the enormous bath . It was done in green and black marble , with racks of initialed towels and a tub the size of a cattle-dipping tank . " Hot diggety dog , " he said softly . " Now that is what I would call a tub . And how about me , with a butler and all ? Very good , sir . ' I bet Grandpa would blow a gasket if he knew . One day I 'll have me a butler , too , but he 'll be a damn sight cheerfuller than this one . " He soaped himself and lay in the tub for only a minute or so , and then he went over to the black marble washstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackheads , no . Pimples  --  a very few . But the beard was out again , stiff and black . Then he noticed to his horror that he was leaking water onto the marble floor . He seized a towel marked by a great black dF , and hurriedly dried himself . Then he looked quickly behind him before he swabbed up the floor with the damp towel . He peeked around the door to see if the butler had left , and walked naked back into the bedroom . The butler had opened the little canvas bag in which Craig carried his shaving gear and toothbrush , and the scant toilet articles were laid out in a primly reproving64line on the dresser . He picked up the razor , brush , and shaving cream and went back to the bath , where he noticed , for the first time , a glisteningarray of gold-stoppered flasks , labeled in scroll lettering with the names of various face creams and lotions and deodorants and perfumes . " I think I like it here , " he muttered , as he lathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorts and went to the closet . He looked intently at the clothing hanging inside . One was a gray flannel suit that smelled freshly new . One was a Tuxedo that had never been worn . One was a sports coat of cocoa-brown flannel , with fawn flannel trousers . Two pairs of shoes , with trees  --  one pair brown buck , one black  --  sat smugly on the floor . A half-dozen neckties hung from a rack and a half-dozen shirts were stacked on the shelf above the hangers . He chose the brown sports jacket with the almost matching pants . When he was dressed he looked at himself admiringly in the mirror . A man looked back at him . Not Craig Price , boy , but Craig Price , man . " Maybe someday I 'll be able to pay him back , " he said to himself , aloud . " But it 's sure nice to have athletes for friends . " " You still going home with that fancy roommate for Christmas ? " the football player , Jimmy Wilbur , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride north and come home with me for a real Polack Christmas ? My old lady is a hell of a cook . " Wilbur had come into the dormitory store to check on the cigarette supply . Craig was sitting in a straight chair trying to nuke some sense out of a trigonometry formula , and was truly pleased with the interruption . " Thanks , Moose , " he said . " That fancy roommate of mine has asked me down to Charleston to spend the holidays with his ma . Remember ? I told you . " " Yeah . I wondered if it was still on . I made you a bet . " " I still got the ten . You want it back ? And I still do n't know what the bet was all about . " " Skip it . You 'll know when you 're bigger . " He looked at Craig who was wearing his knickers and a sweater . Overnight  --  in less than three months  --  Craig had shot up suddenly . His former chubbiness was gone and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet tall . He had quit combing his hair straight back and now wore it parted on the side . What had been a cowlick was now a wave . " Kid , you 've changed a lot in a couple of months , " Wilbur said . " I did n't realize it until I looked at you in those little boy pants . You look like a grown man playing kid . " " Thanks , " Craig said . " I thought I 'd wear the knickers down to Charleston and save my good suit to impress Phil 's mama . " " What good suit ? Not that thing with the bell-bottomed trousers and65the Joe College jacket ? His old lady would like you better in short pants . God , kid , you ca n't go off to visit the quality folks dressed like you are . You need some clothes . You got any dough at all ? " " About five bucks , " Craig answered . " Plus your ten . " " Tell you what , " Wilbur said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's from my home town . We 'll go see him . Maybe we can fix a deal for some new duds . " " I ca n't pay for any new clothes , " Craig said . " I have n't got any money and I 'm not likely to have any . I do n't even know if I can get back in school next quarter , unless I can do something with the Loan Fund . I 'm busted . My folks are broke . " " The hell with it , " Wilbur said . " Let 's go talk to Shev . " Shev was an enormous blond man of about twenty-two who was playing his final year as guard on the football team . He had made a Southern Conference selection for two years , and second-string AllAmericanin his junior year . He had a wide , humorous Polish face and a broken nose . He was the campus representative for the College Shop , which sold good , stylish suits and haberdashery . He was paid a salary and a percentage on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing football . The salary was provided by one of the alumni who still had some money left from the crash . " Hi , kid , " he said to Craig . " Hi , Moose , " to Jimmy Wilbur . " Come to buy some of my fancy dress goods ? " " Maybe , " Jimmy Wilbur said . " Look , the kid here is a friend of mine . IIe needs some clothes . He ai n't got a plugged dime , but he 's got to have some clothes . " " We sell clothes for money here , " Shev said . " You play football for free , too , do n't you ? You play it because you love the game . You play for Alma Mater . That 's why you are such a good haberdashery clerk . Look . How many suits you got here ? " " I du n no . A hundred . Maybe two hundred . Who cares ? Nobody 's buying anything anyhow . " " Nobody 's going to miss one , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have some money pretty soon . Let 's say we lend him some duds , and he pays you back a little bit at a time next semester . " Wilbur winked . " I ai n't going to have any mo  --  " Wilbur kicked Craig sharply on the shin . " Shut up , " he said . " Now pick out what you need , and 1 ' 11 handle it all with Shev . Okay , Shev ? " " It 's my job if I get caught , " Shev said . " What the hell , " Wilbur said , " you 're through this year . That punt you blocked against Virginia -- which I managed to fall on , making you a cinch for All-America , I might say  --  will get you a coaching job any place . You 're only a punchy Polack anyhow , and you could n't pass a course in coed watching if you did n't have more muscles in your back than you got in your head . " 66 " Well , all right Moose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's pick out Rome stuff and get it altered . You can write me a check in front of the tailor to make it look good , and I 'll tear it up when you get the clothes . " " I have n't got a check , " Craig said . " I have n't got a bank account . That 's not honest . . . " " Shut up , stupid , " Jimmy Wilbur said . " They got blank checks here . You know the name of a bank ? Any bank ? In your home town ? " " Sure . The National . But it went busted . . . " " It 'll do . A bum check on a busted bank ai n't any worse off than a good check on a busted bank . Here . Sign there . " They walked out after the tailor had finished . They went into Ilarry 's restaurant next door . Harry was a Greek with a fine friendly reputation . He gave unlimited credit to athletes , and sometimes to their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Greek , a burlesque accent , and smeared his hair liberally with oil . Some of the campus wits occasionally remarked that Harry cooked with the same oil he used to tame his riotous hair . He was behind the service counter when Craig and Jimmy Wilbur entered . The student waiters had not yet arrived to handle the supper shift . " Hi , Moose . Hi , keed , " he said . " Wat you wan ' ? " " Two cups of Joe and a couple of slabs of pie . What you got besides oppla and peenoppla ? " " Strornberra and pits . Fresh . " " Make mine peach . You , kid ? " " Strawberry , please . " When the Greek leaned over to serve the coffee and pie Jimmy Wilbursaid quietly , " You need a new waiter . The service is terrible here . " The Greek started back and smote himself a mighty Hellenic blow on the forehead . " Me ? More waiters ? These ottletes  --  peegs  --  already they eat me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppetite like boz-zard ? " " Relax . The kid 's not an athlete . He 's a friend of mine . Come on back to the kitchen for a minute . Drink your coffee , kid , while I have a talk with Harry . " Craig was finishing his pie , wondering what it was all about , when the two men came back from the kitchen . Jimmy Wilbur had his arm around the Greek 's neck . The Greek was shaking his head . " Hokay , hokay , " he said . " So I got a new waiter . Bot maybe we all go to jail , hey ? " " Not if we run it right , " Wilbur said . " Come on , kid . You got a job starting after Christmas . Only on weekends  --  Friday through Sunday . Pays twenty-five dollars a month and your chow . You 'll probably die of ptomaine , but it 's better than starvation . Harry 'll give you an advance on your pay now . How about ten bucks , Harry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came out with a soiled ten . He looked at it sadly . " These wick , " he said . " I lose twenty bocks instead of just ten . " " You 'll get it back , baby , " Wilbur said , and handed the money to Craig . " You 'll get it back , all right . See you . " When they crossed the street and walked along the quiet campus pathway Craig took the money out of his pocket and extended it to Wil- bur . " I do n't understand any of this , " he said . " The clothes , the job , the free food . It does n't make any sense . . . " " Sure it makes sense . Look , I put through that bootlegging deal 1 told you about . We handle the retail end through Harry . I do n't trust many people , but you 're smart enough to be my boy . It works like this : The word 'll get around that you can buy a jug from Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a word to the right waiter  --  that 's you  --  and the price in advance will get you a jar of corn anywhere you want it , delivery guaranteed in the ( lark of the moon . Your job is just to take the order and grab the dough and pass the word to my messenger service . It 'll be having Cokes next door in the drugstore . " " But where is the booze ? Not in I larry 's ? " Jimmy Wilbur smiled . " No , not in Harry 's , little boy . He 's just the connection point for the weekend sports that run out of booze or ca n't get out to Botts ' . You do n't have to sec it . You do n't even need to know where it 's stashed . You 're just the middleman . It 's better if you do n't know . You ca n't get caught for just writing down a name , a fraternity house , and a figure saying " one " or " two " or " six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gross sale . Not much , but some . It 'll be good booze , because we 're making the gin ourselves , and the alky 's all right . It ought to be . " Wilbur smiled again . " Where are you getting the alcohol ? " " Ask me no questions , pal , but I can tell you this . It 's not from Dur- ham or the bootleggers in between , and it 's guaranteed not to make you go blind . We got no complications , kid . Come on . It 's one way you can stay in school with a little style . . . " " So , " Craig said , " I will be sixteen years old in less than two weeks , and I am now a bootlegger . Or at least a bootlegger 's assistant . " " That 's right , " Jimmy Wilbur said cheerfully . " It ai n't any worse to sell it than it is to buy it . If you got any moral objections look at me  --  an amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the angels ? " " Well , all right , " Craig said . " But one question I have to ask . Who are your messengers  --  your delivery boys ? " " Athletes , " Jimmy Wilbur said , and smiled dreamily again . " Mostly track stars . You see , in a way I am doing extra service for Alma Mater . Dashing all over this campus with a jug of hooch under their arms will keep them in steady training for the greater glory of the school . " Philip poked his head in the door as Craig was buttoning his new jacket . " Well , I 'll be damned , " Philip said . " Look at you . Where did you get the new duds ? " " I came into money . " Craig grinned . " How do you like it ? " " Very elegant . Who 's your tailor ? " " Credit , " Craig said . " On the cuff . Do n't you think we better go say hello to your mama ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes roved to the bottle of Scotch . " My God , boy , you struck a spark off Julie . We smuggled that stuff back from England , and it just is n't handed out to everybody . And putting you over here , in her favorite room . . . hmmm . " Ile opened the bottle and raised the neck to his mouth . " Good stuff . Not cut . " He coughed and extended the bottle to Craig . " Have some . " " I do n't think so , " Craig said . " Later maybe . But I do n't think Miss Julie would like it if we both came down smelling boozy . I 'll wait . " " Okay then , let 's go see Mama . " Philip gave " Mama " the English intonation . A large arch revealed a fresh vista of flagged hallway , as the carpetedelegance of the formal hall stopped just past the double entrance to the huge stairway . It was ceiled in a kind of festive canopy of redand-white-stripedsilk which sagged slightly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ornate tent . Again the indoor planting made him feel that he was already in a garden , and seemed not to be a house at all . The flagged hall ended in another arch , thrusting you suddenly into an enormous patio surrounded completely by the house . The secondstorygalleries were enclosed by white balustrade and the entire facade of the first floor was of glass . Here all was vast glass doors or huge sweeps of arched windows . It looked , felt , and smelt like Craig 's mental pictures of Africa or Polynesia . It was all a-jungle with tropical profusion : enormous fronds of elephant-ear or towering palms , great trees of banana , creepers twining up the purely decorative French lampposts with the octagonal glass tops . A riot of small palms , pepper trees , pomegranates was accented in a forest in which camellias peeped from plants unknown , and the entire varicolored family of roses seemed to climb the plinths with sluttish disregard of home or intent . In the middle of the jungle was Julie duFresne . She was sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavily chased silver tea service was one slim crystal vase containing one longstemmedand very elegant yellow rose . The garden was so overblown with bloom that Craig felt he was walking into a hothouse . The patio was rendered fleshly by the enormousbanana plants , sweet-sickly scented gardenias , the head-heavy roses , and the purple bougainvillia which swarmed the walls . In the tropical setting she seemed more beautiful , and much younger68 69than before . She did not rise as the boys walked into the garden , but held out one hand and offered a cheek to Philip . Then she smiled at Craig , and held out the other hand . " Come and kiss your old Auntie Julie Hello , " she said . " Let me look at you both . " Her eyes swept Craig up and down , and then turned to her son . " He does n't seem to have improved much , " she said directly to Craig . " But you seem to have become a man , and a very good-looking one , too , I might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . " She waved at two chairs , one on either side of her . " Sit down and have some tea . It 's nice to have you home again , brat . And so nice you could come , Craig . Where are the knickerbockers ? " she shot the questionsuddenly . " Upstairs , " Craig said . He smiled . " That 's a nice suit , " Julie duFresne said . " Thank you , ma'am . It 's the first time I 've had it on . " " It 's not one of mine , Julie , if that 's what you 're thinking , " her son said hurriedly . " I was thinking nothing of the sort , " she replied . " Lemon in your tea ? " " Sugar , please , " Craig said . She looked at her son . " Front the smell of you I imagine you 'd like a whisky ? " Philip blushed . " No , thanks . . . ma'am , " he said . Julie duFresne smiled at Craig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see somebody finally taught him a thing I 've failed in . Manners . " She tapped a cigarette on the table . Craig was on his feet swiftly and struck a match . Julie duFresnesmiled at him through the smoke , and raised an eyebrow . Craig sat down and picked up his teacup , and hoped to God he would n't break it . " That 's a very pretty room you 've put me in , " he said tentatively . " I never saw a room like that before . " " It 's too womanish , " Julie duFresne said . " But it 's my favorite , apart from my own . If you 're wondering why I put you there ; nstead of in with Philip , I thought you might have seen enough of each other at school in that dismal dormitory , and would want a little privacy . " She got up . " I must go and change now , " she looked at her wrist watch . " Pants are fine for daytime , but . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busily watching her face , noticedthat she was wearing slimly cut jodhpurs . It was the first time he had ever seen a woman in pants . She caught the look . " No , I do n't ride , " she said . " But for knocking about the house , I like ' cm . " She grinned and held up her hands , which seemed immaculateto Craig . " Believe it or not , I 'm a gardener , and no matter what70they say in England you ca n't garden in gloves . Maybe you boys would like a nap ? We 'll have drinks about seven . " She preceded the boys into the house , and it took a physical effort to prevent Craig from staring at her buttocks in the tight breeches . His head reminded him that this was his roommate 's mother , but the jodhpursdid fit her rather snugly . Craig had never felt so much like a fool in his short life . He had been reading quite a lot of Somerset Maugham , and he was of the impression that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip showed him briefly round the house he went to his room and laid out his " Tux " on the bed . He had never actually worn a dinner jacket , apart from the fitting , but it felt and smelt festive , like good dance musicsounded , like pretty girls looked when they got all fancied up for the Saturday night dances at the beach in the public pavilion . He also remembered how handsome the Tuxedoed old people  --  peopleof thirty or more  --  looked before the crash , when his parents had an occasional party and a small colored orchestra was brought into the living room in the big square brick house , with punch on the sideboard and folks making frequent visits outside to parked cars to return smellingslightly more fruity than the punch . He stroked the black broadcloth lovingly , and experimented with his jazzbo black tie . He laid a white stiff-fronted shirt atop the jacket , and found a wing collar and a small box which contained collar buttons and studs . He took out his new  --  unworn  --  black plain-toed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took another bath , in which he wallowed a long time , and then savagely attacked his fingernails until he had buffed them raw . He scrubbed at his teeth , shaved again , although he shaved scarcely two hours ago and his skin was as smooth as a baby 's bottom . He plastered down his unruly cowlick-turned-wavewith stickum . And then , slowly , surely , lovingly , he inserted himself gently into his shirt and pants . He had quite a bit of difficulty with the studs and with the cuff links , and also with the collar buttons , but the black jazzbo hooked on very nicely . He slipped on his shining shoes and went to the long mirror to inspect himself . He snapped back his lips in a movie actor 's smile and reflected that he , Craig Price , was one hell of a handsome fellow , with the last of his deep summer suntan making the collar whiter , his teeth whiter . " Pretty soon , " he muttered , " I think I 'll grow a mustache . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Colman . But even without it I sure do n't look sixteen . " His eye dropped to the bottle of Scotch . Craig had experimented with whisky just a little  --  an allowed toddy or eggnog at Christmastime , and last summer , after he had graduated from high school and was71playing big-for-his-age with a variety of maidens at parties and at the beach , he and some other rakehells had slipped out to take an occasionalnip , washed down with Coke , of the local corn . That stuff was clear white , burnt all the way down , and left a coating of fusel oil on the teeth . It came in half-gallon fruit jars , not in slender graceful bottles that stood on tables in a delicate room in Charleston , S. C.He decided that a man of parts such as himself  --  Beauregard Price , the well-known Charleston dandy  --  had best fortify himself with a drink before he joined the ladies . " Joined the ladies , " he said aloud . He liked the sound . " Joined the ladies , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch . He expected it to explode inside him , but it did n't . It went down as smooth as honey , as light as air , as strokingly hot as August in his stomach . He took another nip , and the glow increased . He lit a cigarette , which tasted better than any cigarette he had smoked since he first took up corn silk and rabbit tobacco when he was eight . The Scotch did something to the tobacco 's flavor . Then and there Craig Price resolved that when he was rich he would drink nothing but Scotch . He looked at his grandfather 's old hunting-case watch . It showed a five-to-seven . Craig decided to have another drink and another cigarette while he waited . His checks felt a little warm , but his courage was mounting . The suit had been expensive  --  $24.50  --  hut it was worth it , if it made you feel like this . As for the Scotch . . . ah . " Now that I 'm gon na be a bootlegger , " he said aloud again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm selling . " Just before Craig started to dress , Philip had said : " Do n't bother to wait for me . I 'm going to grab a little nap . That drive made me tired . Go on down and talk to the old lady . She 'll be in the drawing room  --  that 's the big door to the right as you came in the front  --  and do n't be very late . She 's a prompt one . Seven o'clock sharp will find her there  --  patting her foot . " Craig took another look at himself in the mirror , combed his hair again , and drew a deep breath . " Now or never , " he said , and plunged toward the staircase . Its curvingmahogany rail was satin under his hand , and its carpeted stairs were so soft he could almost feel the softness through the thin soles of his new shoes . He went out into the long hall , past the flowers he did not know , and turned left into an enormous drawing room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , striking golden sparks off the massive dog-irons and the clustered tongs , poker , and brass shovels on either side . Nobody was there , although a table next one wall was agleam with decanters and glassware . Everywhere there seemed to be flowers  --  yellow roses in flat silver bowls , something he knew as delphinium from Grandma 's garden , and enough gladioli to furnish a funeral . It was the first time Craig had ever seen what he always thought ofas a parlor with more than one sofa in it , and this one had three . Two identical small sofas faced each other on either side of the fireplace . They had curved backs and tiny legs and looked a little too frail to accommodatemore than one person . They were upholstered in some kind of funny dull green velvet stuff . The third sofa was bigger than Craig 's bed and it struck him as highly peculiar that it should be dead white . fie had never seen any white sitting-down furniture before and thought how impractical it would be if you had a houseful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a large cherrywood table in front of it , cluttered with a mess of silver pots : sugar pots , cream jugs , bonbon dishes , and other implements of internal warfare he did not recognize . The rug looked kind of faded but it was thick and silky feeling , and large clusters of pinkish flowers grew off its white surface . The walls were a nice pale green , he thought  --  like the woods looked in very early spring . Sort of like a green apple that would give you the bellyache . The two deep bay windows that you could walk right into had yards and yards of green satin drapery edged with some sort of funny fringe . It seemed like a hell of a lot of material for a window . Next to the windowpane was something he had never seen before . There were two sets of curtains , like a sissy-looking nightgown , kind of white lace , evidentlyfor the daytime , because they could be covered up at night by pulling across enough green velvet drapes to make a sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , and placed in front were matchingtables made of some sort of gold stuff with inlaid flecks of other colors . Little velvet chairs with a deep fringe all the way to the floor were flung aimlessly around , but it was the three sofas and the enormous rosewood piano which commanded his attention . A gold-framed mirror , as big and round as a cartwheel with a snottylookingeagle on top , occupied most of the wall space over the fireplace . Behind the piano there was another enormous mirror which could n't seem to make its mind up what it was , since it was framed with wood and had a crazy-monkey picture painted in the top half of it . The lamps were made out of a kind of pink glass , the exact color of the camellias that floated around in bowls , like water lilies in a pond . Most of the furniture was cluttered up with needle-point pillows , the same sort of woman-stuff that Miss Caroline used to work at for years at a time . Electricity seemed to be lacking in this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while there was a large crystal chandelier hung from the center of the room , it appeared never to have been lit . Craig had his back to the door and was studying the vast circular mirror with the eagle on top , running his fingers over the most enormouspiano he had ever seen , leaning over to sniff at a bouquet of gladioli in a large vase that rested on a strip of yellow satin flung overthe gleaming surface of the piano , when the cool , slightly accented voice said : " Hello there . You 're early , are n't you ? Where 's Philip ? " Craig whirled as if he had been caught stealing . " He  --  he told me to come on down when I dressed . . . that . . . that you liked people to be prompt . " " And so I do . " Her eyes roved briefly over his new finery , and if she was amused , she masked it admirably . One brow quirked briefly over the turquoise eyes . ( Some years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must , " he said , " have been got up like a pox doctor 's clerk . " ) She was wearing a long hostess gown  --  although Craig did n't know what to call it then  --  of a blue velvet that hugged her closely up top and flowed swiftly from her hips to the floor , so that only the shining tips of her shoes peeped from beneath the hem of the gown . The bodicewas cut to nothing in front , and she wore no necklace . The sleeves were long , and on one wrist she wore a massive bracelet in which blue and white and red stones appeared to leap out of the heavy twisted gold . She seemed all white from the bosom up until you got to the scarletslash of lips , and moved to the eyes and the tightly drawn-back hair into which , somehow , gardenias had been worked behind the tiny ears , which wore almost barbaric hoops of gold and seed pearls . " You look very handsome , Mr. Price , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better as a scared little boy in your knickers . " Craig 's tongue swelled in his mouth , making speech difficult . " I . you . . . this house . . . " He stopped . He could n't very well tell her that she was the loveliest thing he 'd ever seen . " Perhaps you 'd give me a cigarette , " she said , walking toward him . " They 're there , in that box . And would you like a drink ? Sherry , per-haps ? " Craig fumbled for the box and managed to extend it without droppingit . He could n't seem to find any fire , until she indicated a hammeredsilver lighter in the form of a swan . Craig managed to depress the little lever and produce flame without setting his hostess aflame . " Sherry , please ma'am , " he said . If she had said arsenic his answer would have been the same . She moved to the cocktail table , unstopperedone of the decanters , and poured a drink of pale amber fluid into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers . She passed it to him with a smile , poured one for herself , walked over to the fireplace , and raised the glass to Craig . " Salut , " she said . " A votre saute . " " Yes ma'am , " Craig replied , and downed the sherry in a gulp , settingthe glass down swiftly before it bit him . When he looked , Julie duFresnewas sipping her sherry and looking at him with amusement . " It 's really for sipping , " she said . " Try again . " " I 'm afraid to , " he said frankly . " I 'm bound to bust something . " " No you wo n't . Pour yourself another glass , and let 's sit down . " She isaved toward one of the two matching curved sofas in front of the fire , She gestured toward the cigarette box , and Craig took one , lighting itith trembling fingers . He sipped his sherry , and could think of nothingwhatever to say . " You 're a nice boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it rubs off on Philip . He 's rather spoiled . Will you continue to room together ? I have n't had a chance to ask him , and we do n't correspond very oftene.xceptwhen he needs money . " " It must be nice , ma'am , to be able to write when you need money . " " Please do n't think me rude . But have you any money at all ? What about your family ? " " I do n't mind a bit . What little we had we lost . My father 's been kind of rattling around from pillar to post since the crash , when all the banks closed . He had the same job for about twenty-five years , but now he seems to get this job , that job , and do n't any of ' em pay very much . They manage to eat  --  and owe money . " Craig smiled . " What are you smiling at ? " Julie duFresne leaned forward , and the boy could not resist glancing at the deep shadow her cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Me . I owe money too . But for different reasons . Except I 'll pay . My pa , he thinks that once he 's borrowed , the money belongs to him and he gets mad when somebody asks him to pay it back . He figures they 're trying to take something away from him . " " What are you talking about ? " Sharply , now . " What are you all talking about ? " Philip came into the room . He was wearing an ordinary gray flannel suit . He struck a pose , in mock horror . " My God , Julie , who 's your rich friend ? Not "  --  more drama  --  " not my roommate ? What did you do , Craig , stick up a filling station when my back was turned ? Get up and let me see that suit . Where 'd you get it ? " Craig colored . It could have been the fire and the unaccustomed alcohol . " Stole it , " he said briefly . Julie duFresne looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner in this house , " she said . " Go and change immediately , Philip . Has three months of college made you forget your upbringing ? Hurry . Dinnerwill be on in fifteen minutes . You 're already late as it is . " Philip started to speak , but his mother 's eyes closed his mouth . " Out , Alamein , " he said , and swiftly left the room . Craig looked up . His face was still red . " You did n't have to do that , " he said . " I 'm sorry . But it was new coming here and I saw you and saw Phil 's new car and heard so much . . " Hush . " Julie duFresne leaned forward , kissed her finger lightly and gently touched the end of Craig 's nose . " You 're a sweet boy with all the74right instincts , even if you are n't quite up to them yet . " Then a twinkle lit her eyes . " But tell me , please , where did you get the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig said . " I did n't steal it . I got it on credit from the College Shop because I wanted to look good when I came here . " " But how did you get it on credit if you did n't have any money ? " " I have a friend , a football player , a guy who 's kind of looked after me since I first got to college . He is going to be a bootlegger in the winterquarter . He got me a job as a waiter , and I 'm going to help him bootleg . " Craig was miserable , but he looked directly at her . " I reckon I better leave now . You would n't want a waiter or a bootlegger in this house . " Julie duFresne laughed , throwing her head back . She laughed as a man would laugh . Then she stopped laughing and took Craig 's face in both hands , and kissed him lightly on the cheek . " My dear , darling , honest boy , all flustered and ashamed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , if none so young . And I am not unmindful of the compliment implied , that you should turn to a life of crime to do me honor . I have seldom been so flattered . " Craig grinned uneasily . " Maybe you do n't mind then if I do n't know much and do the wrong things ? " " My dear boy , " Julie duFresne said , and she was quite serious . " In your life you may do a lot of bad things , but you 'll never do a wrong thing . Now , I hear my progeny 's footsteps . Will you escort me in to dinner ? " She took his arm , and as they entered the dining room Craig Price felt that he stood just about eleven feet six inches tall . He had expected the dining room to be as large as the parlor , but was surprised to find it relatively small ; not much bigger than his bedroom . From the high blue white-linteled ceiling another enormous chandelierhung directly over a smallish round mahogany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay if that thing ever came loose ' from its moorings . A whole covey of candles reached up from glass receptaclesthat looked like enormous transparent milk bottles turned upsidedown . A big silver something carved in grapes and other silver doodads stood in the center . The table was already laid for three and there was such an array of silver that he was certain he would never find out which fork to use on what , and he had no idea at all what the different-sized glasses and goblets would contain . The walls were papered a very light sky blue with a design he liked , something like white peach trees with gay birds perched on the branches , but neither the birds nor the blossoms resembled anything he , had ever seen in a fresh spring orchard around Kensington. 76Enormous gold curtains with tucks in the top surrounded two narrowwindows set into carved white frames , with little yellow sit-down things under each window . They looked like a cross between a big saddleand a cobbler 's bench . Slim-legged chairs that again seemed too fragile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with cushions to match the curtains , and the rug was the same material as the one in the parlor except that this time the big roses were yellow as well as pinkish . Craig decided that he would never feel easy enough in this room to work up an appetite in it . Philip handed his mother into her chair , and she motioned Craig into a seat on her right . The butler came in , removed the green , goldflecked plates , and placed the heavy black silver-stranded napkins to one side . Ile served a greenish soup , smoking , from a silver tureen . Craig , panicky , looked quickly to see which spoon Julie used , and dipped the same kind into the soup . He was expecting some odd delicacy like sharkfin soup from the Orient  --  Somerset Maugham again -- but was delighted with what he tasted . " Why , " he said , " it 's turtle soup ! " " Is that surprising ? " Julie duFresne asked , smiling . " In a way , " Craig mumbled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time in New Truro , when I was a boy  --  I mean when I was a kid . I sort of did n't expect to . . . " he stopped , embarrassed . " Did n't expect to find it here ? We 're a seaport town too . We 're all alike  --  Kensington , Charleston , Savannah , Jacksonville , New Orleans . Seafood until it runs out of your ears . " Philip had recovered some of his poise , momentarily lost when his mother banished him to make up for Craig 's gaffe . He was looking very handsome in a velvet smoking jacket which obviously had cost considerably more than Craig 's $28.50 splendor . " Are you boys going to any of the Christmas balls ? " Julie looked at her son . " Not unless you make us . Please , Julie . They 're still back in the Civil War , with dancing cards and a lot of dumb debutantes . Bunch of dam ' stand-arounds . If you do n't mind , we 'd rather knock around on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " Philip said hurriedly . " I ca n't say I blame you too much . I think they 're a bore . But how about our guest ? Would n't Craig like to see some of Charleston 's blue bloods whirling around in their modern pantalets ? " Craig made a clumsy attempt at gallantry . " Would n't be anybody there as pretty as you , ma'am , " he said , and blushed . " I mean . . . I would n't know what to do , and I 'd feel miserable . I mean . . . " Julie dipped her shining head in acknowledgment . " Thank you for the second compliment , " she said . She rang the bell , and the butler arrived to clear away the plates , re-77placing them with a service casserole  --  something that smelled delicious , and proved to be white slivers of trout buried in a saffron sauce which contained tiny river shrimps . He raised his eyes enquiringly . " Trout marguery , " Julie said . " It 's wonderful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's better in New Orleans , " Julie replied . " Try some of that white wine . They go well together . " Craig noticed that the butler had filled a small delicate long-stemmed glass with a faintly yellow wine , and a larger goblet with a ruby wine . He saw then that the white wine bottle peeped from an enormous ice bucket on a side table  --  a bucket flanked by a dust-crusted bottle of red wine , cradled at a forty-five degree angle in a silver holder . Conversationfaltered . " Tell me , " Julie said a little later , as the butler replaced the fish with a peculiarly sauced , broiled chicken flanked with broccoli , tiny mushrooms , and little inflated shells of Irish potatoes , with an oily green salad in a side dish . Craig observed that the butler removed the white wine glass when the chicken arrived , and that his hostess was sipping from the crimson goblet . " Tell me , " she said . " What do you plan on studying at school ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigolo , " Philip said , pushing a piece of crisp French bread around in his chicken sauce . " He 's got all the makings . " " Stop sopping your bread , Philip , and be serious . " " They do it in France , and we 're French , are n't we ? " But he stopped , nevertheless . " What do you want to be , Craig ? " he asked . " I 'll be a writer if it kills me . " " It probably will , " his mother drawled . " Or mc . But what , Craig ? " " I really do n't know , Miss Julie . I 'm awful young , and fresh out of the country . I 'd like to try to be a writer , too , or maybe an artist , but it seems to me that 's an awful tough way to make a living . It takes too long . I have n't got any talent for mathematics , or enough money to study to be a doctor or a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes too long . " " You must want to be something . " Craig grinned shyly . " Looks like right now I 'm going to be a crimi-nal . " " What are you two talking about ? " Philip said . " It 's a private joke , " his mother replied . " Nothing that concerns you . Here 's the dessert . We can talk about this some more over the coffee . The champagne now , LeBlanc . " The third , flat-topped shallow goblet suddenly contained a froth of bubbles . " What happened to the Musigny , Maman ? " Philip managed a leer . " You were awfully fond of . . . of Musigny in Paris . " 78His mother fixed him with a cold stare . To Craig : " Do you like cherriesjubilee ? " " I could n't rightly say , ma'am . I never had any before . But it looks real wonderful . " It looked wonderful and tasted better . The black clustered cherries on the special ice cream , with the butler setting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . Craig took a bite of the hot-cold dessert , and manfully reached for his champagne . The bubblesgot up his nose , tickled unbearably . He sneezed  --  a sneeze , he felt , that was the loudest sneeze ever sneezed since people started sneezing . Ile went purple and started to cough . " Do n't worry , " Philip said cheerfully , " the first time I tried champagneI threw up , cheeries jubilee and all . " " Philip , for heavens sake ! Are you all right , Craig ? " " I think so . Please excuse me , but it 's the first champagne I ever tasted . Does it always do this to you ? " " Not when you 're used to it . Personally , I prefer the still wines , like Musigny "  --  and again she fixed her son with a chill eye . " When we 've finished our dessert let 's go into the living room for coffee . " The butler or somebody had tossed a couple of fresh logs on the fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roving up the candlelit walls . It gleamed against the heavy-silver coffee service , and struck diamond splinters from the crystal decanters which held liqueursof a dozen colors . " I think we wo n't have any liqueurs with the coffee , " Julie said . " We had quite a lot of wine with the dinner . " " It was the best dinner I ever had in my life , " Craig said . " What do you call the chicken ? " " Coq au vin  --  chicken in wine with mushrooms and things . How do you have your coffee ? " Craig took a quick look at the tiny fragile shells and gambled . " Black , please ma'am , " he said . At home he had always had coffee in enormous thick cups , the coffee crinkled with cream , and at least three spoonfuls of sugar . Julie reached for the cigarette box and offered it to Craig , then to her son . Craig dived for the lighter and made a creditable effort to light his hostess ' cigarette without sweeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white divan , with a boy seated on the sofas on each side of her . " Tell me some more about what you 're going to do  --  what you want . " " Everything , " Craig said suddenly , without thinking . " Everything . First I want to travel a lot  --  I do n't know how . But I will . I want  --  I want to make lots of money . I do n't know how I 'll make it , but I will . somehow . All my people always been desperate  --  poor or middlin ' poor . I do n't like the idea for me. " 79Julie duFresne looked at him gently , and without amusement . " I somehow think you will , " she said softly . " Would you like another cup of coffee ? " " Yes , please , ma'am , " he said , and leaned back to look into the fire . He had always been able to find faces in firelight , but there were no faces there tonight . Only shadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes open . The wine , the food , the trip , the excitement seized him , and his lids drooped lower and lower . He pulled himself together with an effort . He looked across Julie duFresne at Philip , who was frankly asleep . " Some people are coming in later , " Julie said , " but they 're rather bores for you boys . I think you 'd better go and get some rest , and we 'll start it over tomorrow . That 's a very long trip from the Hill to Charleston . " She reached over and nudged her son . " Wake up , Philip , " she said . " Time you young gentlemen sought some slumber . " Philip shook himself awake . " What time is it ? " he asked , his voice blurred . " Not late , " his mother said , " but you 've had a long tiring day and I think you both need some rest . Craig 's very tired . " " No , ma'am , " Craig said earnestly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , I think I 'm drunk . " " Not off the wine , " Julie said . " Come on , off with you now , both of you . " She raised a cheek to he kissed by her son , and then turned her head to Craig , who awkwardly pecked the other side of her face . " Sleep tight , " she said . " Good night . " When they reached the top of the stairs , Craig said to Philip : " Do you always eat like this  --  live like this ? " " I suppose so . " Philip yawned hugely . " Most of the time anyhow , when we 're both home . Good night , pal . I 'm away to dreamland . I am really bushed . Tomorrow we 'll go out and sec if we ca n't rip the town apart . " As he turned to go to his room , Craig said , with slightly alcoholic gravity : " Philip , I really want to thank you for having me here to visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawned again . " Do n't bother . Hell , it really was n't so much my idea as hers . Go on to sleep now , and I 'll see you in the morning . Ring that bell by your night table , and somebody 'll bring you your breakfast . Ask for what you want . We never eat breakfast together in this joint . Nobody can stand the sight of each other in the morning . G'night . " " G'night . " Craig went to his room and saw that there was a lit lamp by his night table , and that one of his two pairs of pajamas had been laid out across the bed . He was very tired , and drunk  --  drunk in the sense that liquor will take hold of a man who comes in from the cold after a day 's hunting and who feels the alcohol seize him when he80ands before a fire . He felt more tired than if he had played four quarters of football . Ile undressed quickly , found strength to hang up his new Tuxedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pajamas . He dived into bed  --  nd went straight off to sleep without remembering to turn off the lamp . Once , early in the middle hours , he heard the sound of adult male I ughter surging up from below and knew jealousy which brought him ' L rely awake . For the first time in his life Craig Price was deeply , iously , in love , and with a woman more than twice his age . Sixteen was %ery young to be in love with any woman , especially a rich and beautiful woman twice your age . Fatigue conquered jealousy , and as Craig drifted off again he muted : " I wo n't always be this young , " and snored . Bright arrogant sun streamed through the windows when he woke , ondering briefly where he might be . He writhed under the soft sheets is a puppy might flex himself on awakening , stretched luxuriously , and looked at his bedroom again through sleep-blurred lids . Then he came fully awake , and had the momentarily horrifying thought that he might Live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bathroom , suffering his first mild but rather exhilarating hangover : His mouth felt uzzy as he brushed his teeth . He stuck out his tongue and did n't like the look of it , so he scrubbed at it with the toothbrush . He remembered then that he was to ring for his breakfast , that nobodyever went down to have breakfast with anybody else . He had put his watch on the night table : seven-thirty . Too early to disturb old whatever-his-name-was or anybody else . He decided to go back to bed and think a little bit . While he was thinking a little bit he fell asleep again and was awakened at eight-thirty by Philip banging on his door . " You had breakfast yet ? " Philip was wearing a dressing gown , pajamas , and slippers . He had n't combed his hair . It bristled like a coxcomb . His face was rumpled . " No , not yet . I woke up once but went back to sleep again . " " So did I. Say , our Julie must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke me up about one and it sounded awful party-fled . Maybe we should have stayed up and watched the fun . " " I heard them , too . But I do n't think the grownups really wanted us around . Anyhow I was awful tired . And drunk . " " Me too . I 'm hung . I feel like hell . Tell you what , let 's ring for old Applenose and we 'll have breakfast here and then go look around my unfavorite city . Not that there 's very much to see . " " Do we dress first ? Before we eat , I mean ? " " Naw . Eat as we are . Julie wo n't be stirring until lunchtime . She leaves late and gets up late . Bang on the bell . " " Before I do , can you lend me a bathrobe ? I have n't got  --  I mean I forgot to pack one . " 81 " Mais oui , mon vieux . ' Arf a mo . " Philip was being trilingual again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk dressing gown which he threw at Craig . " Now , jerk that cord . What do you want to eat ? " " Not much . Some eggs and bacon , maybe , and a cup of coffee . " " You got a better stomach than me . I 'm settling for a nip of that Scotch and a lot of coffee . Drowns the butterflies . " " Drinking before breakfast ? Ai n't that supposed to be . . . ? " " I reckon . " Philip grinned and lit a cigarette . " Everybody says 1 take after Pa . Here 's your health . " He tilted the bottle and shuddered , but looked perceptibly brighter after he stopped coughing . " One for you ? " " Great God , no . I had enough last night to last me a month . I 'm just not used to this stuff . I think I 'll take a bath instead . " " Okay . I 'll order for you . What do you want to see first  --  museums , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumter , what ? " " If you do n't mind I 'd kind of like to see the water front . I feel more at home on water fronts . Let 's go watch a ship cone in , something like that . Down at the docks . " " You know something , Craig ? I 'd really like to . I went to sea once . Here 's LeBlanc . ' Morning . Mr. Price wants . . . " The rest was drowned in the rush of Craig 's bath water . When he 'd finished bathing and shaving , Philip was back again , the better for a bath and a shave , and LeBlanc was bringing in a wheeled table with covered silver dishes which smelled delightfully . When he lifted the cover from one dish Craig saw some flaky , crisp long rolls . " What are those ? " he asked . " Croissants . French breakfast rolls . Try some with that jam there . Coffee and croissants are about all the French  --  the French in France  --  eat . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Me , I 'll still take ham and eggs . These look wonderful . " They finished their breakfast and dressed . They strolled outside in the warm winter sun . " Let 's walk down to the docks , " Craig said . " it 's too nice a day not to walk . Also I think that green steamboat of yours kind of do n't fit with stevedores . " " I would n't say that . Us blue bloods get along very well with the dockers . In a way we 're a very democratic town , Charleston . We only fight among ourselves . The blue bloods are always battling . Amalie is sore at Sophie , and Pierre has heard that Henri has told Armand . . . you know . " " This does n't seem like an American town at all . It does n't even smell American . " " It is n't . It 's one part French , one part cracker , and one part African . We rule out the crackers and so it turns out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen Algiers  --  half French , half shine. 82Its t I can tell you a funny story about how the blue bloods and the tIu. kwallopers get along . " They were strolling slowly down a narrow , cobbled street . It was not too far from Yamacraw , the Negro settlement , and Craig noticed how black  --  coal-black , almost blue-black  --  the Negroes who thronged the streets were . He had heard Grandpa Sam mention " blue-gum niggers , " but had never really seen any . These were not Negroes as he knew them , but straight West Coast Africans  --  Africans who talked the GulI . Itas their relatives a bit further south talked the Geechee . The sounds ' ere fascinating . The high-pitched babble of the unseen women in little hack courts , the deep bass voices of the men in the faded patched dun- ; pees , the distant barking dog , the squalling cat , the lonely plinking of .1 cigar-box banjo all melted into the smell of frying fish and damp mottledplaster walls that would never lose a nose-itching odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lush vegetation and rancid cookingfat and horse dung overlaid with dust  --  delved into his nostrils more deliciously than last night 's champagne . He wished Philip would shut up , but Philip rattled merrily on . " You know , " he was saying , " we got a big event once a year . The stevedores and watermen are real proud of their rowing . Once a year there is a big regatta . The towns down this way  --  Savannah , Charleston , and Norfolk  --  all enter the boat races , and for us it 's as big as a World Series or the Kentucky Derby . They do n't talk about anything else , and the main idea is that no matter what happens Charleston has just got to beat Norfolk . " So anyhow , a couple of years back they were practicing every day on the Cooper River , and about two weeks before the big event the stroke oar caught a crab and busted his arm . You can imagine what that was like . Every man jack had bet a year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shell with no stroke oar only two weeks before the big races . " " Mmhm , " Craig said . " So what did they do ? " " I told you we were a democratic city . The boys got together and had a conference . The captain of the crew said something like this : Mon , we got trouble . We got to find a new stroke oar someplace . Any you guys know a mon can row stroke ? ' " Somebody pipes up for a joke : How about young Gaston LeJeune ? Hees pretty good stroke . Win heemself big H for sweater when he row for Harvard , heem . Maybe he row stroke for us , we ask heem right . ' " Mon , hees blue blood . He won ' row with river rats . ' " You can ' tell . We don ' lose nothing if we ask heem . We sen ' three mon ask heem . Formal . Mebbe he play ball . ' " Well , " Philip said , " they went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody in town is a cousin of mine  --  and the idea amused him . There 's not much to do in Charleston and the idea that a83sang bleu would be rowing with a bunch of water rats for the honor of dear old Charleston would make a lot of party conversation for a long time . So Gaston said sure , and he went down and worked out with the boys every day . Everybody got to be fine friends . So the race is on . " I must say Cousin Gaston , apart from being a little fat and out of shape , was a pretty fancy stroke oar , and the Charleston shell jumped out ahead early and kept a good lead . But coming down the river about a thousand yards from the finish , that Norfolk shell began to creep ahead . Its bow was just coming abreast when the Charleston coxswain started to yell . " Row ! ' he hollered . Row ! Row ! Row ! Row , you dirty sons of bitches  --  and Monsieur LeJeune ! ' " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on different levels ... " They walked through a dockside warehouse , stacked high with huge crates girdled tightly with broad bands of shiny iron ribbon . Gleaming black bucks , naked to the waist , with sweat rags tied round their heads , chanted as they lifted and toted , heaved and pushed . Craig and Philip sauntered into the sunlight outside to the edge of the mooring dock , and sat down on ancient , smoothly-worn mooring bollards . A ship  --  a tired , wave-abused ship  --  was tied up ' longside . She had come a weary way . She was of the ancient cargo vintage known as Hog Islander , relict of World War I , Bowlike and ungainly , but an eminently practical beast of burden . Her rusted name plate proclaimed her Sundance , and her stack wore the colors of the South Atlantic SteamshipLine , home-based in Savannah . Abaft and above her foc'sle head and forward hatches was the wheelhouse and officers ' quarters . A ' midshipshatch separated the wheelhouse from the main deckhouse , which contained the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder led downward to another stretch of hatches , to be surmounted again by the fantail , under which the crews slept  --  deck gang starboard , black gang port . They were separated by the steering-engine room . The Sundance had evidently not enjoyed a very clement voyage . She was a fairly light ship now , although the winches still rattled as the after holds took on cargo . The red lead below her Plimsoll line was scabby and rusty-pink . Her gray paint job was scabrously eaten away , and sailors on rope-suspended stages were sloshing paint onto her gaunt sides . They had not yet painted down so far as the port which dischargedsewage bilge , and her outer skin , under this porthole , was as streaked and foul as an island inhabited by herons . Her stack was smoke-blackened , and she looked weary and very , very sad . " I think she 's beautiful , " Craig said . " I wonder where she 's been ? I wonder where she 's going ? " " Not Tahiti , if that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not this scow . This rust-bucket and all her sorry sisters make a regular run . They generally leave out of here and they go to Liverpool , and then to Rotterdam and on to Hamburg . Or they go to London , Antwerp , andHamburg . But they mostly pay off in Jacksonville , and start loading a little bit there . Then they take on a little more in Fernandina , and some more in Savannah , and they wind up here to top off the load and shove off again for Liverpool , Rotterdam , and Hamburg . The bedbugs do n't go back into the bulkhead until you 're about three or four days out and it gets cold again . Also the food stinks . So does the cargo . This one 's reversedher course . She 's doing it all assbackwards . She 'll work south and sail from Jax . " " How come you know so much about this ? " Craig was frankly astonished . Philip laughed , deprecatingly . " In my post-Boy Scout phase I took sick with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just after I was kicked out of Woodberry Forest . Last year Julie knew somebody important in Savannah and they got me a job as workaway on one of these sad scows . No pay , sleep with the ship 's carpenter  --  and what a nasty Swede he was  --  and work all day and half the night in port . Not for Philip , never no more . " " What did you carry as cargo ? " " Beautiful stuff . Sheep manure , sulphur , nails , and phosphate rock , with some logs for a deckload . All I know about going to sea was how it feels to push a broom . Julie figured the sea trip would make a man of me . It did n't . It damn ' near made a woman of me , for every old wolf on the ship had a stab at me . " " A stab at you ? What do you mean ? " " I keep forgetting how young you are , " Philip 's smile was patronizing . " My poor innocent child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of old men  --  especially engineers  --  who spend their lives at sea . To them a young boy is prettier than a woman . The same thing happens in prisons . I 'm telling you , I pretty near had to stick a cork in my behind when I went to sleep . That 's what I 'm talking about , or do I have to draw you a picture ? " " But did you  --  I mean , how did n't  --  I mean . . . " " Once . I did n't like it . It hurt . But he was a lot bigger than I was so I said , Oh , hell , go ahead . ' " " Are you lying again ? " Philip grinned sheepishly . " As a matter of fact , I am . A little bit . When it got too bad I went to see the captain and reminded him who I was , how I got on the ship , and who Julie knew . After that I did n't have any trouble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bother to make up all these lies ? Where does it get you ? Why bother ? " " I really do n't know . I like to think that it 's the novelist in me coming out , but when I look at it honestly I guess I 'm just a natural-born liar . I 've always been a liar . I never told the truth in my life except from necessity . It 's one of the reasons Julie does n't particularly adore her one and only son . She thinks I 'm weak . She may be right . " " I do n't understand it , " Craig shook his head in honest wonder . " You 've got everything . You 've got a wonderful home and a wonderful mother and plenty of money and a car and you 've been to Europe and . . . " " Maybe that 's the trouble . Maybe I do n't want a wonderful home and a wonderful mother and plenty of money and a car . None of it 's mine , including my wonderful mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a wonderful something . " " I do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , " Craig said . " But I do n't think I like it . Anyhow I do n't understand it . " He changed the subject abruptly . " Tell me , Phil , what were the foreign ports like ? London ? Antwerp ? " His change of subject sounded awkward . " I do n't know . I was so fed up with seafaring when we hit London that I cabled Julie , who was in Paris , and joined her there . I completed my summer of culture in Fontainebleau where Julie had a house . " The answer was terse . " You just quit and ran off  --  and went away from the ship ? Just like that ? " " You could hardly call it jumping ship . After all , I was just on the damn ' thing as a favor to Maman , and they were probably glad to get rid of me . I was n't much good at anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " I would n't have quit . " Then he looked up , straight at Philip . " What ? " Philip deserted the inspection of his feet . " I said : ' I would n't have quit . ' 1 would n't quit anything once I started it , not if it killed me . " " I expect you would n't . You got a streak of bulldog in you that I. have n't got . Me , I do it the easy way . " Philip went hack to inspecting his feet , as if he 'd never seen them before . Craig was silent . He was watching the men , slung over the side on the hanging scaffold , slabbering great streaks of paint on the ship 's flanks . He noticed that the paint buckets were lowered over the taffrail by a line , and that the two men on each scaffold maintained a delicate balance to keep the plank at even keel  --  that they were constantly spattered by paint , and cursed monotonously as they worked . He also noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel  --  who walked up the gangplank . Some came back immediately . Others stayed aboard . " Who are those people  --  the ones going up the gangplank ? " Craig pointed at the shabby human stream . " I was a seaman long enough to answer that one , " Philip lifted his head . " ' These are people out of work . On the beach , it 's called . Most of those guys are ex-sailors  --  masters , mates , engineers , bosuns . They 're broke and they 're going aboard to bum a free meal . If the cook 's in a86. , , tal humor he 'll give ' em a handout . If he is n't , back they go over the side again . I think there 's something called a depression on . " " There is , " Craig said . " There certainly is . " Then : " Tell me one thing , Phil . What was that business last night about the wine . Muse  --  Museen  --  Museeny or something like that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " I was having a little off-stage go at Mummy , as the British might say . Dear Old Mum had herself a big thing in Paris with one of my summer uncles . Francois , this one was . I can remember because he was just after t'harles  --  he pronounced it Sharl  --  and just before Henri . He pronouncedthat Onree . I think there was some talk of marriage , but it was all very intense . Uncle Francois particularly fancied this Musigny brand of wine , and Julie particularly fancied Uncle Francois . She still drinks Musigny , even though Uncle Francois eventually went back to Mrs. Uncle Francois , whom he had handy in the corner as an excuse all the time . I do n't really think I care for my mother very much . " His voice was suddenly soft , and very cold . " My mother 's a whore . " Craig jumped to his feet . " Now wait a minute , " he said . " You ca n't talk about your mother like that ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sadly old . " Take it easy , " he said . " She 's my mother . If I want to call her a whore , I will . 13ecause that 's what she is  --  a whore . A beautiful , spoiled , gracious , charming , intelligent  --  whore ! " Craig hit him . Philip fell sideways off the bollard , and remained on the dock . A thin stripe of blood inched from the corner of his mouth and made its wavery journey down his chin . " Get up , you bastard ! Get up and fight ! " Craig stood over Philip . " No , " Philip said , " not this boy . I like it down here on the deck . Kick me if you 'd like , if it 'll give you any pleasure . I do n't fight over whores . " Craig felt very weak and suddenly sick to his stomach . Philip cradled his head in his right hand , lazily resting on his elbow , and made no effort to wipe the creeping blood off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack Dempsey , " he said . A drop of blood left his chin and plopped onto the planks . " She 's had her eye on you from the first , young as you are . Not now  --  no , of course not , not now . But some day . You 'll keep . You 'll keep , all right . I 've seen her plant it before , and you 're on the chosen list . Even Julie has n't got bad taste enough to crawl into your bed right now , but it 's only a matter of time , my boy , merely a matter of time . Grow up and cone back . Exceptyou wo n't be here as my guest . You 'll he her guest then , in her house , in her bed . You 'll never be my guest again . You want to hit me some more ? " " No , Phil , I do n't want to hit you . But I do n't think I want anything to do with you any more either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lousiest piece of . . . you just plain stink . " 87 " You might well , very well , be right . " Philip got up and reached for a handkerchief . He dabbed at his bloody chin . " You got quite a punch . I always thought I stank . I even liked it when you socked me . I think I wanted you to hit me . Asking for it . Well . . . " He shrugged . " What now ? " Craig looked at him , and felt something writhe in his stomach . It was a feeling not unlike the one he had when first he looked at the maggots working on the defunct Bell . A sort of . . . of . . . of violent distaste , mingled with nausea . Bile rose in his throat . " My mother maybe got sick suddenly . She has n't been well lately . If I can use your phone to call Kensington I 'm almost sure she 'll be sick enough to want me to come home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head and flipped a wrist outward in total negation . " If you feel that way , okay . We 'll go hack to the house and make the call . I 'm sorry I loused up the holidays , but you did ask me about Julie , did n't you ? " Philip shrugged again . He touched a handkerchief to his mouth . It had stopped bleeding . " It 'll teach me to keep my mouth shut . I 'm sorry too , but I like your mother a lot . I like her . . . I like her a lot better than I like you . " Craig 's voice had softened . . . sorrowfully , apologetically . " That 's obvious , " Philip said . " Let 's go home and make the call . If my mother "  --  he stressed the word mother --  " is n't up yet we can just fake it . It 's only about three hours to Kensington . I could drive you ... " " No thanks . 1 ' 11 hitchhike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salty bitterness on his tongue . " I wish I 'd brought my Joe College suit . It would make it even easier . Nobody would take me for a gentleman . As it is I guess I 'll climb back into my short pants , and maybe they 'll take me for a boy . Overgrown , but a boy . " His voice hardened . " But not your kind , Philip . Never your kind . Let 's go . 1 'd like to say good-bye to your mother . " " Miss Julie , I 'm dreadful sorry , " Craig said , " but I reckon I better go home . Ever since Ma had that measles thing she 's managed to catch every cold that came down the pike , and when I talked to Pop he said it looked like pneumonia . . . bad . I better go home and see what 's going on . Christmas and all . . . and Ma sick . " " 1 understand completely , Craig . You would n't be happy here , worrying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mother wants her child at home . Even one like mine . Are you sure I ca n't have the chauffeur drive you ? " No mention at all of Philip by name . " No , thank you , Miss Julie . I 'll just grab a bus . There 's one leaving at 2:30 , and 1 ' 11 be home in time for supper . Easier that way . But it sure has been fun and I hate to spoil it . " Julie duFresne took him by the arm and walked him gently to the88ratio . Once again he was uneasily aware of the fleshiness of the banana onds , the hothouse heat of the waxy flowers. " ( ' raig ? " " Yes , ma'am ? " " Come here . " Julie took him by the shoulders and looked steadily into his eyes . " I must do something about Philip . " Now the name . " With the dentist I mean . His gums are bleeding again . " Craig looked at her and said nothing . " Craig . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me again some day ? " " If you want me to , ma'am . I 'd love to come and see you again . Ma'am . " " Why did you hit him ? " She fired the question . " Hit who ? " Craig 's eyes widened . Julie duFresne shrugged . " All right , " she said . " I hope your mother 's better when you get home . Craig . . . " " Yes , ma'am ? " " He was right . I 'm not a nice  --  . " " That bus is going to leave pretty soon , Miss Julie . I better go get my " Of course . Kiss me good-bye , Craig . " She turned a cheek . He kissed her a short , savage peck . " You know you 're always welcome in this home . " " Thank you , ma'am . I hope I can come back some day . But now I think I better leave . " " One thing . Are you really going to be a bootlegger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of staying in school . " " I would n't if I were you . You wo n't like it  --  later . Can I  --  this is hard to say  --  may I possibly help you , Craig ? " " Help Philip , " he said , roughly . " He needs it more than me . Goodbye , ma'am . And thank you for everything . " " Come back , Craig Price , " she said , and turned to walk into the house . Philip dropped Craig at the edge of town over the Cooper River bridge and in front of a shabby filling station . " You ought to be able to hook something here , " he said . " You still sure you do n't want me to drive you home ? " " Thanks again , Phil . No . Like I told your mother  --  easier this way . I 'll be home in three , four hours . " " You still sore at me ? " " Not really . Yes , I s'pose I am . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore that do n't . . . that do n't scab over . But thanks anyhow . Good-bye . " 89Philip looked at Craig , looked at him steadily as his mother had looked at Craig . " Maybe I 'll finish up at the Sorbonne , " he said . " That Chapel Hill is awful goddamned dull . I really do prefer Paris , do n't I ? " " I du n no , " Craig said , and turned away . " I do n't know what youwant . So long . See you in Chapel Hill maybe , before you head for the Sorbonne . " It was an enormous low-slung blue car , a Cord . The driver was bald and fat , not sloppy fat , but robust with the kind of fat that was neatly smoothed as by a trowel . The kind of fat that housed bursted veins in the cheeks , to make a falsely healthy flush  --  the kind of fat that was fat all over , so that the collar was too tight , the coat wrinkled behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swabbed his streamingred face with the back of his right sleeve . He got out of the low-slung Cord and said to Craig : " Fill her up . Where do you go to piss ? " " I do n't know , sir . I just got here . Back there , I reckon . " " Oh . " The fat man took a raggedly chewed cigar from his wet lips , looked at it with distaste , and flung it away . " 1 thought you were theattendant . " He looked Craig up and down . Craig was wearing his knickers again , and carrying his bag with the college sticker on it . " College boy ? " " Yessir . Freshman . I 'm hitchhiking home . " A gentle aroma of bruised corn came from the fat , flushed gentle- man . " Where you going , Buddy ? Where 's home ? " " Kensington . Home for Christmas . " " That 's where I 'm going . I live there . Can you drive ? " " Yessir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth are floatin ' . You tell the attendant to fill her up , and if you drive me home without both of us gettin ' killed , there 's ten dollars in it for you . Okay ? " " Okay . Thank you , sir . " " Polite , ai n't you ? I like polite kids . Now . . . " the fat man with theflushed , vein-burst cheeks darted around the corner of the service sta- tion just as the attendant came out . " Man says fill ' er up , " Craig said . " Did n't say , but you better look at the oil . These things drink it . " " You got one ? " the attendant asked , unscrewing the cap to the gas tank . " Not yet , " Craig said . The attendant grinned . The fat sweaty gentleman came out buttoning his fly . He had a fresh cigar clenched in his teeth . " Man , I feel ten years younger and ten pounds lighter . How much , son ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil , " the attendantsaid . " Your friend told me to check it . " " That was smart of him . Already earning your pay , hey ? " he smiled . " Let 's have a Coke before we start . You drink whisky ? " " Not when I 'm driving somebody else 's car , " Craig said . " Not a carlike this . " " Good boy . Long as I 'm the passenger I think I 'll have a snort . It 's in the bag back there . Get it out for me . " Craig opened the bag . It was filled with dirty linen in which nestled a quart bottle of corn whisky . " God , " the fat man said , as Craig handed him the bottle . " What a night . Mud in your eye . " He tossed his head back and the bottle gurgled . He coughed , and drained half a bottle of Coke as a chaser . " I needed that one , " he said . " I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sleep when I drink too much . 1 can drink and I can drive , but mixin ' ' em is too much for me . Thanks , Buddy , " as the attendant brought him his change . " Let 's roll . I think I 'll crawl in the back and grab a wink . Man , that Charleston is a town . . . Maybe New Orleans is better , but last night . . . " The fat man climbed into the car . He produced a hat from somewhere and pounded it into a pillow , wedged it into a corner , and snuggleddown . Craig eased in the clutch and the big car slid smoothly out of the filling station . " You said you live in Kensington ? " the fat man asked . " Yessir . Between there and the Sound and sometimes in New Truro . " " What 's your name ? " " Price , Craig Price . " " Any kin to Dick Price ? " " He 's my father . " The man laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school together in New Truro . I was kind of sweet on your ma , too . My name 's John Grimes . Shake . " He reached a hand over from the hack seat . " Sure . Nice to know you . " The fat man took another long pull at the bottle , and nestled his head onto the hat . " Home , James , " he said , and promptly went to sleep . He did n't wake up until they crossed the bridge over the Cape Fear River , on the outer lip of town . He took another ounce out of the bottle , and punched his hat into shape . " That was quite a nap . We kill anybody on the way ? " " Nope , " Craig smiled . " Not even a dog . " " You must drive plenty good . You still live out Market Street ? " " Nosir . Pa lost that one . We lived there for a while after , but Mother'sgot a job now down at the Sound . That hotel there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dietitian , they call her . I suppose it 's another name for cook . " The fat man looked keenly at the hack of Craig 's neck . Craig could sec hint through the rearview mirror . " You do n't let yourself up much , do you ? " The fat man was serious . " That business about your mother being the cook , I mean . " Craig stopped for a light before he answered . ' There ai n't no point to saying she 's a bank president . A cook is a cook . Where do you want to go , Mr. Grimes ? " " I got plenty time , and I 've had nearly ' bout a night 's sleep . Suppose you drive yourself home and 1 'll take over from there . " He worried at his pants pocket . " And kid . . . " " Yessir ? " " Do n't take me wrong . I know your pa and I knew your ma . Here 's your ten bucks , and Merry Christmas , and thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do that . If anything , I owe you for the free ride . I could n't . . . " " The hell you could n't . Take it and shut up . You earned it . And say . When you get out of school and maybe need a job come see me . I got a lot of irons in the fire . " " What do you do , sir ? If I come see you for a job ? " " Funny you made that crack about bank presidents . I 'm a bank president . I just bought one . The one that did n't fail . " " We had the wrong kind of bank . Thanks , Mr. Grimes . I 'll take the money . And . . . thanks . " " You 're welcome , Buddy . I got a kid about your age . A little girl . She 's getting out of high school this spring , and she 's going to St. Mary 's . She 's goin ' to be a real pretty little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look her up and take her to a movie or ask her to a dance or something . " " What 's her name ? " " Maybelle . After my two grandmothers . Matter of fact , why do n't you come by the house for some eggnog ( ' hritnmas afternoon . . . maybe . . . and maybe meet the family ? " The man seemed oddly hesitant , as if asking a tremendous favor . " We could talk . . . " " I 'd like to . Where 's your house ? " " Well , it 's . . . it 's in Delgado . You see , I own some mills , too . " " All those cotton mills ? " " Not all . " The fat man smiled now with pride . " Only the one that ai n't shut . Like the bank . The one that 's open . " He still held the money uneasily . He leaned over and shoved it in the general direction of Craig 's right hand . " Here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , hear ? " " I sure will , Mr. Grimes . Where ' bouts exactly ? " " Well . . . it ai n't exactly in the mill district . It 's in a place that ai n't really got a name yet . It 's not too far away from the new school. 92Big white house between the school and Winter Haven . Gon na have a nice name , that piece of ground . Forest Glen . " " How do you know what it 's gon na be named ? " The fat man achieved a blush . " I . . . I own that land , too , " he said , and almost added beg your pardon . " I named it . " " I was in the seventh grade at the school the first year it was built , " Craig said , suddenly finding a friend . " I know your house now . We used to go swimming in the creek behind it during lunch hour , and made the teacher awful mad . I did a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mess of quail back of the graveyard . They use there and flush into the swamp . " " Looks like you been shootin ' on my proppity , " the fat man said . " Maybe I better look me up some law . " Craig laughed delightedly . " You better be careful , " he said . " The sheriff 's a friend of mine . My huntin ' partner . Who you gon na get to arrest the sheriff ? " The fat man slapped his thigh . " I guess I 'll have to take it as high as Raleigh , " he roared with laughter . " I own most of that , too . Legislaturesdo n't cost much these days . I got me a tame one . " They were breasting the big curve that crossed Ritchie 's Creek , and led through a cathedral of oak trees down to the Sound . They passed an enormous estate , barred from the common man by a huge iron gate . " Fair Lea , " Craig said . " It sure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettier in the fall when the squirrels come out . I used to shoot a lot of squirrels out of that place . " " It 's a nice place , all right . You shot a lot of squirrels ? I thought it was posted . " " Well , it is . But there 's a way to call ' em . You snick the safety of your shotgun on and off , and it sounds like a squirrel eating hickory nuts . Then you do a ' burrrr ' sound with your tongue like this . " Craig made the burring sound horizontally across his mouth , tongue against his front teeth . " It 'll fetch ' em every time . " Mr. Grimes laughed again , very loudly . " Damn me , if I was a squirrel , I 'd come too . I knowed something was getting them squirrels , and it turned out to be you . You ai n't shot any black swans lately ? " " Nosir , they 're too pretty , I . . . " Craig stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm afraid so , son . They had a mortgage that did n't come out even . But up to now I ai n't had enough courage to live in that big old house . I think it 's haunted . I spent a couple nights in it , hunting , and it sure does squeak loud . " " I 'm sorry about the squirrels . I did n't . . . " " Hell 's horns and teeth , boy , they 're a nuisance . But the next time you want to shoot some squirrels do n't waste a lot of effort tolling them across the road . Just walk in and make yourself to home . " 93They rounded the second big curve , and the steaming marshy smell of the Sound filled Craig 's nostrils . He took a big breath , and sucked in the fat sweat of mud and sun . The water stretched ink blue before him , lightly flecked with breeze-tossed wavelets , and the few old gray , barnaclydocks looked homely and battered  --  like well-beloved friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to be back home again , " Craig said . " That first three months in college is a little lonesome . . . you know . " " I do n't know , " the fat man said . " I never finished grammar school . I never been no place much but here and up in Shelby and once in a while to Washington to straighten out some business . Raleigh , of course . " They arrived at the little hamlet , turned left , and went back up the Loop Road . " That 's home , " Craig said , pointing . " ' l'here , across the streetcar tracks . There ai n't any driveway . I 'll get out here , if you do n't mind . And thanks , Mr. Grimes . You sure you 're serious about me coming around to press a call ? " The fat , flushed man got out of the hack scat and slid himself gruntinglyunder the wheel . " Never more serious in my life . You 're a good kid , Craig Price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma . See you after dinner Christmas afternoon . " " Merry Christmas , " Craig said , and toted his baggage up the hill to the little red house which was his current home . This was that year Craig 's mother had forsaken fire insurance for a more reliable job as dietitian in a small resort hotel half a dozen miles away from Kensington . The hotel was a square yellow stucco horror that overlooked the blue sweep of the Sound , which fudged in between a distant beach and the Atlantic Ocean . Across the highway and on the other side of the streetcar tracks sat the little red cracker box which his mother and father had been able to rent so that Lilian Price could be near at all times to her kitchen in the hotel . It had seemed rather an adequate house to ( ' raig  --  comfortable enough and pleasantly placed next an orchard of fat yellow blushcheekedplums gone wild , with a black forest of pine and live oak thrusting its way almost to the back porch . Jays , brilliant blue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . Half of it was devoted to a living room with a large fireplace and the rest comprised kitchen and two bedrooms . It was furnished with other peoples ' drab remnants and there never seemed to be any one chair on friendly terms with any single table . Meals came direct from the kitchen to the living room and were eaten on two large card tables which appeared to be in a state of perpetual indecision concerning their intent to collapse . The little red house had seemed like a charming picnic site to Craig , who was rarely in it anyhow , except to sleep , since his boat claimed most of his attention . Now after a day and night in Philip duFresne 's house in Charleston it seemed a squalid horror , a ratty compromise between the solid comfort of the old but now lost big house in Kensington and a sharecropper 's shanty . His mother still had on her brown hotel kitchen uniform when Craig 's new friend , Grimes , dropped him on the road . " What are you doing back here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas in Charleston with your roommate . " Craig went up the rickety porch stairs and kissed his mother before he answered . " I decided I did n't like it much down there in Charleston , " he said . " It was a little too rich for my blood , and anyhow I have never spent a Christmas away from home "  --  he looked around him  --  " before . So I decided to come back . " " You wo n't find a whole lot of Christmas here this year , " his mother said , looking at him sharply . " You 've changed , son . I think you 've grown up . School all right ? " " All right . I made out . Where 's Dad ? " " He ought to be in any minute . " " Ma  --  a man gave me ten dollars for driving him from Charleston . Will you take it and buy you and Pa some sort of ( ' hiistmas present ? " He reached into his pocket and found the money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice man and he told me to buy myself a present with it . " Lilian Price took the money . She held it in her hand , as one might observe a rat or a moist baby bird , or possibly a snake . " He did n't try to do anything bad to you , giving you ten dollars just like that ? " " No , Ma . He was just a nice fellow . He said he knew you and Pa . He comes from New Truro . Named John Grimes . Little fat red-faced fellow . " Lilian Price put the money in her apron pocket . She went over to a chair and collapsed into it . She stretched her varicosed legs straight out in front of her , and wiggled her feet . " I could of married him , " she said . " I could of had everything he 's got now . Instead of this . " Her nostrils spread as she looked around the room . " Who is he , Ma ? He sounds awful rich . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town . He 's . . . He 's . . . He 's poor white trash from New Truro . His daddy was a cropper on your Uncle Jimmy 's farm . I used to play with John Grimes when I was a littlegirl . What does he look like now ? " " Fat . Drinks a lot of liquor . But he told me he was a bank president and he owns Fair Lea and mills in Delgado . He said . And he asked meto come over to his house after dinner Christmas . To meet his daughter . She 's going to school at Saint Mary 's in Raleigh next year . " " You go , boy . Maybe if he wants to he can help you in college . Somebody'sgoing to have to , because we can't. " " 1 do n't want anybody to help me in college . I do n't want to belong to nobody . Specially somebody I do n't know . He was just a nice man . " " l do n't reckon he 's a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't rightly know , but he could n't be a nice man to do what he 's done so fast when everybody else is broke . It 's wrong to be so rich when everybody else is poor . Wrong . Look at us . Lost everything . Sold the car  --  no . They took it back . Me working in a hotel . Your father selling insurance . Selling insurance ? Nobody can buy any insurance . Nobody can pay the Piggly-Wiggly bill . The only reason we 're making it here is I can bring back enough stuff from the hotel to keep us from starv-ing . " She flourished the ten-dollar bill . " That 's the only cash money we got in the house right now and a shirttail boy had to bring it to me . My sister 's working as a waitress , and glad to get it . Where 's our house ? This rattrap ? We used to have two cars . Your father played golf . And you  --  a shirttail boy  --  have to give me the only cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into tears . Craig felt dreadfully embarrassed , and more than faintly hostile at the display . ' Phis did not seem a necessarytime to weep . " Do n't cry , Mother , " he said . " It ai n't all that had . Things 'll get better . . . " His mother glared at him . Her tears had stopped . " Better ? Better ? How 'll it get better ? Me working in a kitchen like a nigger ? Your father peddling insurance ? Better ? " " One of these days I 'll make it get better , " Craig said . " Somehow . Somehow I 'll make it get better . " " Maybe you will , " his mother said . She sniffled into a handkerchief . " But I doubt it . You sit here and wait for your father . I got to go to work  --  in a kitchen . Like a nigger wench . Like a nigger wench . " She went out the door , but turned before she left the porch . " I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before we sold it . " " How 'd he do it , Pa ? " Craig asked , when his father came home . " How 'd he hit it ? So fast and all ? " " 1 could n't really tell you , Son , " Richard Price said . " All I know about Johnny Grimes is that nobody ever beat him in a swappin ' contest . Somehow he always wound up with the same knife and your best taw agate as well . He was a natural-born trader . " " But how , Dad , how ? " " I told you , I do n't know . We went to grade school a little bitthatwas before I came to Kensington , before your Aunt Marge mar-96Tied the schoolteacher  --  and he was a kind of dumb , fat kid . He did n't come from nowhere , his pa was a dirt farmer , and he did n't make any grades as I remember worth anything special . But he had this trader instinct . Seems to me , as I mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine trees and selling the turpentine before he was knee-high to a grasshopper . Then he did something with a ground pea crop . Then he got mixed up in cotton trading . Everything he touched turned to money . Including his wife . " " Oh ? " " Yeah . She was skinny as a rail and she was ugly . Kind of freckled , with white eyelashes . But she was the only daughter of old Holmes McCadden  --  youknow , McCadden Mills . She was the apple of the old man 's eye . I wo n't swear on the Bible that John Grimes knocked her up on purpose  --  " Richard Price stopped speaking for a moment , suddenly aware that he was talking man-to-man  --  " anyhow she got into the family way and somebody was guilty . " He looked over his shoulder . " I wish to Christ it had been me . Old McCadden took down his shotgunand went looking for his son-in-law . He found John Grimes . There was a big to-do . Old Mac was so upset he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  got born . And John Grimes wound up with a flock of mills . Turned out old Mac owned most of a bank , too . " Richard Price cleared his throat , snorted , and lit a cigarette . He spat some phlegm into the fire . " That is what is known as a success story . If you ever get a girl knocked up try to find one with a rich father . " " He seemed like a right nice man . I mean , he was nice to me . " " You can be nice when you 're rich . Why the hell would n't you be ? It 's easy . All you need is money to be nice . " " I do n't believe it , " Craig said . " I know some people got money and they ai n't very nice . " " Try it out on me someday , " his father 's answer was grim . " 1 ' 11 be the nicest son of a bitch in town if I have a little money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sweat niceness . But you need money to sweat pretty . Then it ai n't sweat and do n't stink like sweat . It 's per-fume . " He searched his pockets for another Lucky Strike . The packet was wrinkled , crumpled , and empty . " In the meantime , " he said , " I have n't got any cigarettes . " " I got some , " Craig said . " Have one of mine . " " My thanks , " his father said , sarcastically , " to my rich son . " Christmas promised poor doings . Craig went out and cut a cedar tree and his mother unearthed some battered old silver-speckled , redand-goldglass ornaments , so at least they had a tree . Lilian used the ten dollars well . She bought three cartons of cigarettes , a two-quart jugof local scuppernong wine , and a box of Christmas candy . Craig borroweda shotgun from one of his shrimp boat friends and came back with a brace of mallard ducks , which seemed obese . " Where 'd you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't look like wild ducks . " " They ai n't , exactly , " Craig said . " You could kind of call them wild ducks gone tame . " " Fair Lea ? " " I ai n't saying , Pa . But they sure are pretty , huh ? " " They 'll eat good . Count our blessings as we may . I suppose you 're big enough to have a snort ? " " I 'm a college boy now . " " Son . " Craig 's father was serious . He fidgeted , clasped and unclasped his hands . Craig noticed that the first two fingers on his father 's left hand were sallowed with nicotine . " Yessir ? " " I do n't see how you can go back to school . Seems like I just ca n't make a turn anywhere . Apart from what your ma makes right now , there just is n't any money  --  and God knows what your mother earns is n't enough . The banks . . . " Craig smiled with a confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that owns a bank . I 'm going to his house for eggnog tomorrow , after we eat his  --  after we eat these ducks . Maybe / can make a turn . I 'm going back to school , Pa , and I aim to stay in school until I get that sheepskin . Do n't matter how . I 'm going to finish college . You know something ? College is like pants . If you got ' cm you do n't miss ' em , but if you ai n't got ' em you feel awful naked . I need college . " His father shook his head , sorrowfully , and stared at his feet . " I went to the Morris Plan , to see if I could n't raise the price of your next quarter 's tuition . I heard the man say : Do n't risk it - they 're bad pay . ' I was n't always bad pay . Until just recently . Seems like it 's all changed now . I do n't know where the hell we 're headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you worry , Pa . I'II make out okay . I got me some clothes and a job , too . I 'm going to he a waiter next term . It 'll feed me and give me a little money beside . If I can arrange the tuition and dormitory rent I 'll make out fine . " " I hope so . Some of us ought to . Well , Merry Christmas , son . At least we 're eating . " Craig looked again at his father , as at a stranger . Richard Price had gone very gray , and was completely bald on the top of his skull . His gaunt face was gray , too , the whiskers greenish-gray , and the lumps around the corners of his mouth stood whitely prominent . His Adam 's apple worked nervously , and his coat sleeves were frayed at the cuffs . " Pa . " Craig spoke softly , hesitantly . " Son ? " 98 " We 're about the same size , ai n't we ? Suit size , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon . You certainly got skinny in the last three months . I suppose so . Why ? " " I 'd like to give you a Christmas present if you could see your way clear to take it . It 's a new suit . " Richard Price 's nostrils flared , and his chin tilted . " What you saying , boy ? It 's my business to buy your clothes ! I ca n't help it if I ca n't . . . " He suddenly buried his face in his hands . " Do n't take on , Pa . I got this new suit  --  by a sort of accident  --  and I got another one , too . I even got a Tux . You 'd like this suit , Pa . It 's gray  --  just your color . Like the ones you used to wear . Would you try it on , anyhow ? I sure would like you to have it . Like it was a favor  --  like it was a Christmas present to me . Will you please try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window . He looked out for quite a minute . When he turned around his eyes were level , if damp . The white lumps bulged more at the corners of his mouth . " Of course , son . Thank you for a very Merry Christmas . Where 's the suit ? " " I 'll get it . You put it on and I 'll put on my Tux , and we 'll surprise Ma . The two best-dressed gents on the Sound . " The new , unworn , gray-flannel suit fitted Richard Price very well . As he looked at himself in the bedroom mirror he said very quietly , " Christ , I wish I was dead . " Then he walked almost jauntily into the sitting room , to see Craig already dressed in his dinner jacket . " My Lord , we 're a handsome pair , " Richard Price said . " Your mother wo n't know us . That 's a good-looking Tux , and this gray suit fits like it was made for me . How 'd you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Craig grinned to take away the sting . " Naw , Pa , I got some prospects and some friends . I 'll make enough being a waiter to pay off the College Shop . " Richard Price turned bitter again . He smacked his right fist into his palm . " Do n't ever bank too much on credit , " he said . " It 's been my downfall . " Lilian Price came through the door , still wearing her brown kitchen smock . It had grease stains in the front . She looked first at Craig in his evening regalia , and then at her husband , sharply , newly resplendent in his son 's suit . She smoothed the front of her Notched uniform with nervous red hands . " I must be in the wrong house , " she said , with a forced smile . " I guess I 'm not grand enough for this kind of company . Maybe I better eat in the kitchen tonight . " " We 're just kiddin ' , Ma , " Craig said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you a glass of wine . We ai n't got much but us , but it 's Christmas and we still got us . That 's better than what most people got . " " I forgot to tell you . " Lilian Price looked at her son as if she were99asking for a favor . " I had a little time this summer and I planted someJerusalem artichokes . If you look in the kitchen cabinet you 'll find a two-quart jar of pickles . " ( ' raig walked over to give her a great smacking kiss . " If for nothing else , I 'm glad I ai n't in Charleston tonight . They eat real fancy there , but I sure did n't notice any artichoke pickles . That 's my Christmas present , Ma  --  and I ai n't going to give any of it to you and Pa . You would n't also happen to have some Brown Dogs , would you ? " Lilian Craig got up and went over to a thick-varnished , scratched sideboard . She forced a warped drawer open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sampler , and removed the top . Craig saw a neat nesting of the little brown-sugar , peanut-studded circular candy which he had eaten from Foxtown from infancy . " They are n't as good as the ones you used to get from Irey Ivin , " his mother said . " But I thought you might like some . I did the best Icould . I have n't had too much time lately . " She gestured futilely at the hotel . Craig kissed his mother again . " I bet they 're better . Can I have one now before supper ? " He made a fuss of taking a candy from the box . " Do n't eat too many . I have to go fix these ducks now . You and Dadjust sit and drink a little wine and 1 ' 11 see what I can do . Do n't drink too much , hear ? It 's a family failing . " Lilian Price went off to the kitchen . Her husband looked after her with almost a shamed distaste . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " RichardPrice said . " She 's working herself to death , and her with the bad heart and all . " " I do n't either , " Craig said . He attempted to lighten the atmosphere . " Pass the wine . And maybe I 'll give you one of my artichokes after all . " Craig got on the beach car and went as far as Winter Haven . The motorman stretched out an arm to hang the hoop neatly on the signal stand 's hook , and ground the brakes . Craig was the only passenger . Hegot out and began to walk . A big blue Cord roadster pulled to a stop beside him. " 1 kind of thought you might be on this car , " the little fat man said . " If you was n't , I was coming to fetch you . You have a good Christmas ? " " Sure did , " Craig said . " Hope y'all did too . Santa Claus treat you right nice ? " " Passin ' tolable , " Mr. Grimes said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Passin ' tolable , " Craig said . " I got what we used to make a joke of in New Truro . Little cracker kid somebody asked what he got for 100Christmas and he said : A crokernut and a ournge . ' I got some Brown Dogs and a two-quart bottle of artichoke pickles . It was kind of slim pickin 's this year . " " I seen some , " John Grimes said . " I seen some that did n't have no crokernut ' and did n't have no ournge ' , and did n't have neither no Brown Dogs nor no artichoke pickles . My God , I love them things . Funny what you like when you get older . I can afford  --  I guess  --  all the fish eggs come out of Russia , and a sirloin steak for breakfast , and all that fancy French cookin ' . But what pleasures me most is a simple dish of ham and hominy or a plate of stew . " They drew up in front of an enormous white-pillared house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . Tall pines shaded an avenue up to the porch . Just in front of the porch stood a huge living fir , gleamingly a-bristle with Christmas decoration . " We 'll turn on the lights when she gets dark , " John Grimes said . " She was something to look at last night . Well , let 's go in and see about that eggnog . " He pulled the Cord up in front of the door . Craig noticed that the crushed-shell circular drive branched off in a Y-shape to an enormous garage , which contained three big cars and space for a fourth . " You sure have got a lot of cars , " Craig said , as they got out of the Cord and walked up the broad steps . " What else besides this one ? She drives real sweet . I forgot to tell you . " " Two Caddies and a Duesenberg . Mama has one Caddie and the other belongs to my kid . It 's brand new . It 's her Christmas present . As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . l have n't got the time to teach Maybelle to drive . If you 'd give her some lessons over the holidays , if you 're not too busy , I 'd sure appreciate it . I do n't trust Mama behind the wheel very much . She drives that big caboose like she 's afraid it 'll bite her . " John Grimes chuckled . " And my garage repair bills say I 'm right . Well , here we are . " They entered an enormous room done completely in red  --  red chairs , red-figured wallpaper , red sofas , red wall-to-wall carpeting , red drapes , accented startlingly by a dead-white grand piano over which a redand-blackSpanish shawl was flung . Long-stemmed red roses flamed from silver and crystal vases . Another Christmas tree , lit , stood in one corner , and underneath its boughs the carpet was heaped with presents , half-unopened . " I like red , " John Grimes said . " I was in a fancy house one time when I was a kid and it was all over done up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama hates red . So to keep peace in the familywe done about four or five rooms like this  --  a white-and-gold one for Mama , a yellow one for Maybelle , a green one for visitors , and I forget the other color . I ai n't been in that one yet . " He grabbed a tasseledbellpull , and a Negro servant came silently into the room . Craig gaped . The servant 's face was shining black , but he was wearing awhite-powdered wig drawn back in a club and tied with a black ribbon . He wore knee breeches and a kind of cutaway coat with brass buttons , revealing a frilled shirt . Lace dripped from his cuffs . Like everything else in the room , except the piano , the uniform was red  --  a velvet so dark it was almost plum-purple . He wore silk stockings and black patentleather pumps with silver buckles . " That 's George , " Grimes said . " George , go tell Mama and Maybelle we got company . Yes , that 's George . I disremember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rig he reminded me of George Washington , so George he is . How do you like him ? " " He . . . he . . . he sure is pretty , " Craig said . " But ai n't he kind of unusual ? I mean , do most butlers dress like that ? " " Hell , no . Most butlers look like a flock of damned undertakers creeping around like they was at a funeral . I like things cheerful . Every time I see George I feel better . " He walked over to a side table on which sat a vast silver bowl . He filled two chased-silver cups with eggnog and handed one to Craig . " I would n't go too heavy on this stuff , " he said , draining his own cup and swiftly refilling it . " It 's got enough rum in it to blow up the bank . That first one was for Mama 's absent benefit . She do n't like to see me swig . So I knock off the first one and sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother and daughter entered rather hesitantly , as if they were strangers in their own domain . Mother was a head taller than John Grimes . She had a beaky nose , not much chin , and a long scrawny neck . Her blond hair was cut very short and was tightly curled . She looked rather like a turkey hen , Craig thought . She was wearing a triple strand of pearls around her neck , and her chapped hands were ringed to the knuckles with stones as big as marbles . Her dress was flapperish . Daughter was a complete carbon of Papa , except that she had more hair and less fat . She was pretty in a plump , rather vapid way , but her china blue eyes lacked Grimes ' sharp animal intelligence . Her weight was mostly baby fat , but Craig had a sudden hunch that she never would do much about losing it . " Meet the wife and daughter , " John Grimes said . " This here is Craig Price that I told you about , the kid that drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach you to drive your Christmas present . He 's a real good driver . " " Merry Christmas , " Craig said , not knowing whether to shake hands or not and finally deciding against it . " It 's nice to know you . " " Merry Christmas , " they replied , in dubious voice that suggested it might as well be New Year 's . " You want some eggnog , Mama ? How about you , Baby ? " " I do n't think so , " Mama replied in a voice that suggested her husband had invited her to share a cup of deadly nightshade. 102 " I do , " Baby said . " She 's too young , " Mama said sharply . " Aw , hell , Irma , this is Christmas , and she 's nearly ' bout grown . Come on , Maybelle , one wo n't hurt you . " He poured a cupful and handed it to his daughter . " Here , Craig , lemme full you up again . Let 's set . " They sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly upright , her knees as prim as her expression . Baby emulated Mama in a stout and ridiculous caricature of extreme propriety . She crooked her little finger as she sipped her drink . Conversation lagged . Suddenly Baby said : " Do you go to high school ? " " I did , last year , but this year I 'm in college . Carolina . I never saw you in high school , though . " " I did n't go . I went to private school . Miss Lacy 's . " " Oh . " " Next year I 'm going to St. Mary 's . In Raleigh . " " That 's nice . It 's a real pretty school . But strict , though . " Mama spoke . " That 's what makes it such a fine school for a young girl . " Papa sneaked another cup of eggnog and was observed by Mama . He hurriedly sat it down on the table . " I wish she was old enough to go to a good coed college , instead of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up if we keep shutting her up in these hen parties . " Mama glared at him and said nothing . Papa shifted his feet . Craig fidgeted . Baby wriggled . Mama got up . " If you 'll excuse me I got some things to do , and I think the menfolk have something to talk about . You 'd better come with me too , Maybelle . It was ever so nice meeting you , Mr. Craig . I do hope you 'll drop in often . " Craig stood up . " Thank you , ma'am . " He turned to the girl . " When do you want your first lesson ? " " Tomorrow afternoon ? " He glanced at her father . " Sure , " Grimes said . " Sooner the better . " " I 'll come about three , then , if that 's all right . " " Fine . Pleased to have met you . Merry Christmas . " She followed her mother out the door . John Grimes heaved a gusty sigh of relief and went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club and two glasses . " I 've had enough of that hellywash . Let 's have an honest shot before I ask you some questions . Mud in your eye . " " Mud . " They drained their glasses , and Craig managed not to cough , although his eyes watered . " I do n't want you to think I 'm nosy , Buddy , but I been asking around and I know your old man is having a rough time . We 're laying off hands at the mill , but that 's mostly sweat labor and I can always use a good office man . It wo n't pay much , but better'n he 's doing now . " 103 " Anything would be better than he 's doing now . I do n't mind telling you . " " But that still wo n't be enough to send you to school . " " 1 ' 11 make out somehow . The main thing is tuition , dormitory , books  --  things like that . I can always make out to cat . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Craig laughed  --  " that 's what they call it . " " What do you mean , that 's what they call it " ? It is or it ai n't , seems to me . " " Well , if you want the truth , Mr. Grimes , I 'm going to bootleg for a living . With some other people  --  athletes . " ( ' raig outlined his arrangement with Jimmy Wilbur . " Hell 's afire , boy , you do n't want to get mixed up with no truck like that . Best you 'll get is kicked out of school , and you might just wind up on the roads , swinging a pick for the state . And once a man 's got a recordon his back every man 's hand is agin him . Ile do n't never stand a chance no more to make an honest living . You forget that bootlegging crap , and we 'll try to figure out something else . " " 1 have been trying to figure out something else . But nothing else seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't got any kind of scholarship . There are n't any real money jobs on the campus . Just free board for washing dishes and the like of that . " " What do you figure it would cost you by the month ? " " To go to school good ? About a hundred a month . Just skin by and do some work on the side ? About fifty would do it . Take care of the fees and that sort of stuff . " Grimes poured another noggin and pointed the bottle neck at Craig . " No thanks . I do n't use it much . " " Look , son . I taken a shine to you the other day  --  I du n no why , but I did . I like your daddy and your ma , and I 'd like to help them get straightened out a little . But mainly I taken a shine to you . We never had but the one youngun , Maybelle , but I wanted a boy bad , and if we 'd of had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , I got more money than I know what to do with , but I do n't believe in flingingit around foolish . More than that , I think a man ought to earn what he gets . It ai n't worth nothing otherwise . I can throw my money like a drunk sailor now , but I earned it , and if I want to set it afire it 's my own business . I want to make you a proposition . I want to give you five hundred dollars a year until you graduate . " Craig started . He hesitated before he spoke . " I could n't do that , sir . I could n't let nobody give me anything . I 'd rather bootleg and take a chance . I 'm sorry , and I sure thank you , but I was n't raised to take nothing from nobody . Thanks just the same . " Grimes flipped an impatient hand at Craig . " Wait a minute . Do n't go off half-cocked . Do n't be so techy  --  not that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I thought I saw in you . This is a business proposition. 104Look here , I 'm a banker , ai n't I ? Do n't bankers make loans ? Ai n't that how they make their money ? I propose to make you a long-term loan . You sign a note and everything  --  the only thing is , I leave the date for repayment open . I could just as easy make it for a thousand a year , but I do n't believe in giving people luxuries . Luxuries you got to earn . But it 's damn ' foolishness to throw away a chance to make something out of yourself for the lack of a few dollars for the grits-and-gravy . " " But Mr. Grimes , I would n't know when I could pay you back . . . if I could ever pay you back . That 's two thousand whole dollars you 're talking about . . . " " Wait a minute , Buddy . I ai n't so charitable as I sound . I like a returnon my money same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is work for me summertimes , and work hard . 1 ' 11 pay you twenty-five dollars a week , and you get to keep five for spending money . I take the other twenty , and it applies against the loan . You work for me three months and I get back three times eighty dollars  --  two hundred and forty dollars . That 's half the loan , ai n't it ? So all I 'm really risking on you is a thousand bucks , which you pay back after you graduate . But you damn ' well better graduate , hear ? You do n't get the money in a lump either . I 'll send you fifty dollars the first of every month . You can take a letter from me to the school people and make your own arrangementson the fees and stuff . Okay ? " Craig stood up and rocked uncertainly on his feet . " I do n't know how to thank you , Mr. Grimes . I just do n't know what to say or how to thank you . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best I can , anyhow . " " I know it , Buddy . Tell your daddy to come see me Monday , and we 'll work out something for him . Oh , and here . This is your Christmas present . Do n't open it until you 've gone . Take the ( ' ord and drive yourselfhome . I wo n't be needing it and you can drive it hack tomorrow to give Maybelle her first lesson . So long , Buddy . See you tomorrow . " Craig almost ran out the door . He jumped into the car and eased it gently onto the road . As soon as he turned a corner he stopped and ripped open the envelope . It contained a fifty-dollar hill and a note which said : Since you made it last fall all by yourself , Buddy , I feel like I owe you a bonus . Spend it on foolishness  --  the business agreement is after New Year 's . Be careful with my little gal when you teach her to drive . Merry Christmas . J.G.Craig was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough to drive a car , big enough to go to school , big enough to have a girl . He leaned his head over the wheel and cried like a small child . He was very , very careful with the Cord as he drove home to tell his parents105the news . He did n't want anything to spoil the greatest Christmas he was ever likely to have . Things seemed altogether different when Craig returned to school after New Year 's . His father was back at steady work again . Not much of a job , perhaps , keeping books , but enough to eat on and pay the rent . Craig had Grimes ' fifty dollars in his pocket , and there was anotherfifty waiting in the Chapel Hill bank . Philip had not returned from the Christmas holidays , and since a lot of freshmen were dropping out because of the increasing stricture of hard times Craig was not assigneda new roommate . He was blissfully alone in the bleak dormitory room . He haunted the library and read enormously . He was a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the art staff of the college humor magazine . It paid him two dollars-and-a-half a month , but it published some of his cartoons and more and more people started to speak to him on the campus . Through one new acquaintance he was able to get a kind of job hustling customers for a campus boardinghouse . It paid him nothing , but took care of at least two meals a day , and he was able to supply the third with a snack of sandwiches and Coke at the dormitory store , where he still worked afternoons . He had very little more than occasional milk shake money , once fees were paid , but he did n't care . His first post-holiday conversation with Jimmy Wilbur , the football player , had been very pleasant  --  warm and easy . " Hi , kid , " Wilbur said , one evening in early January when he dropped by Craig 's room . " See you got back all right from the Christmaswars . Where 's your fancy roomie ? " " I guess he decided not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " " What happened down in Charleston with all the blue bloods ? " Wilbur flopped on a bed and shook a cigarette at Craig . " Did I win my bet ? " " lf you 'll tell me what it was I 'll tell you whether you won it or not . " " Well , it was kind of a three-way bet . One third was that you would n't like it and would go back to your own home for Christmas . Next third was that you 'd probably take a punch at that pansy roommate and have to leave . And the third was that if you did n't leave and did n't sock your boy friend then if you stayed on you 'd wind up in the hay with Mama . Maybe there was a fourth end . I bet solid that our elegant young friend would n't be back in school if any of the first three things happened . That guy 'll never finish anything he ever starts , any place , any time . " Craig flushed . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stay but a night and a day . It was too rich for my blood . I did take a swing at Philip , and left . " " What did you belt him for ? He make a pass at you ? " " Nothing like that . But he called his mother a dirty name  --  a106a whore , if you got to know , and I got mad and socked him . She 's a real nice lady , and I did not wind up in the hay with Mama . God , Moose , I 'm just a kid  --  and she 's a rich , grown woman . What would she want with a boy like me ? " " Plenty . I 'll even bet you another ten that she grabs you before you 're eighteen . That kind of rich , spoiled , traveling dame makes a pastime out of knocking off kids . " " How would you know this ? " " I 'd know it , all right . I got myself practically raped by the wife of a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't much older than you . She was collecting young halfbacks that year . I was a punk and did n't know what I had , but as I remember she was real hot stuff . " Wilbur blew a smoke ring and punched his finger through it . " Like that . " " Well , nothing happened to me so I lose the bet . " Craig reached into his pocket and drew out some bills . " Here you are . " Jimmy Wilbur laughed and shoved Craig 's hand aside . " Save it . At worst , you won three-quarters of it . I do n't need it . But you going to work for me next week when we start this racket ? " Craig was a little shamefaced . " I was going to bring that up . No , I 'm afraid not . I 'm going by Harry 's today and give him hack the money he advanced me , and pay something on the hill at the College Shop . I guess I wo n't be a bootlegger , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into a kind of lucky deal . After I socked Phil and left , 1 was hitchhiking , and this man . . . " " I think he was dead right , " Wilbur said , when ( ' raig had finished . " He sounds like a hell of a fellow . He must have taken a real shine to you . You do n't want to get mixed up in any crookedness if you do n't have to . Me , I do n't care . I 'm sprung out of here in six months anyhow , and I 'll give it a little play for road money . You 're marked for luck , kid . Tell me , how was the daughter you taught to drive her Christmas Cadillac ? Do yourself any good there ? " " I was n't monkeying with my luck . Also she ai n't much to look at , I 'm afraid . Kind of fat and freckled , with light blue eyes . The old man 's nuts about her , though . She 's all he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think the old man has much fun when he 's home . Mama do n't seem to like anything he likes . But I like him , apart from what he did for me . I 'm going to drive him around and run some errands for him this summer . He owns about everything in town . Next year he says he 's going to_the put me in the mills , and next year in the bank . Then he says he 's going to put me to work steady , doing something . " " Sounds like you got your future worked out just fine , " Jimmy Wil- bur said . " Take it easy . Oh , say . We 're having a dance at my lodge Saturday night . Nothing much  --  little music and some eats . Bring your own whisky kind of party . Like to come ? It 's formal , but I know ) ou got a new Tux . How 's about it ? " 107 " I 'd love to . Except I have n't got a girl to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bother . There 's usually a flock over from Duke or Greens- boro , and somebody always gets canned , so there 's plenty of spares . Make it about nine o'clock , hey ? " " I sure will . Thanks . Oh , Moose . . . " " Yeah ' ? " " Mind if I buy a half-gallon jar ? " Wilbur smiled . " You 've come to the right place , Sonny . That 'll be two bucks . Cash on the barrel . And I 'll give it my personal attention . " There is something magic about the second quarter of college . The frightening strangeness has gone . The professors are no longer so awe- inspiring . The basic ropes are handy  --  the terrain is familiar , faces no longer seem hostile . A man  --  for a second-term freshman is a man , having survived the stress of the unknown enemy  --  walks a little taller , holds his head a little prouder . He is lighting now on his own terms , and there is a measureless exhilaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you are n't going to lose it . This place is here for me to use , he thought , as he dressed . Craig Price had no way of knowing how a debutante must feel at her first big party , but he knew that he felt awful good , scared but scared deliciously , while still calmly certain of himself . I le tied his bow tie  --  clumsily , but he had abandoned the jazzho and had bought himself a proper untied evening tie  --  and he hummed as lie tied it . " I got money in my pocket and clothes on my hack , " he sang , think- ing all the time how wonderful it was that he had his future neatly set- tied , and smothering a nasty thought that he was already in thrall to an obligation  --  that he was buying his life on the cuff . I hat nasty intrusion was trampled under the obvious fact that Moose Wilbur liked him enough to ask him to a party at Moose 's own fraternity house , and that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the All-American football player . " By golly , I feel wonderful , " he said  --  flushed from the shower down the hall , shaven and combed and shining in his dress suit . He looked at his watch  --  eight thirty . A half an hour to kill . It would be a long , a very long , half-hour . Read ? No . Study ? Not on Saturday night . Maybe somebody was home down the hall . He walked down the dormitory hallway and rapped on Jimmy Wil- bur 's door . Wilbur was half-dressed , and he was talking to a big , raw- boned blond guy , as he fumbled with his cuff links . There was a quart jar of white whisky sitting on the table . " Gees , clock the kid . Pete  --  Pete Crane  --  this is a buddy of mine , Craig Price . He ai n't very old , but he 's awful smart . From what I know of this lad he will be president of the United States when he hits the age limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Crane got up and shook hands . " This tramp athlete was just talking about you , " he said . " Evidently you made some kind of impression on him . " His voice held a suspicion of the nasal West Country drawl . " I 'll say he made an impression on me , " Wilbur said . " He can run around a room faster than anybody I ever met . He 's the one whose roommate went crazy the first night the kid was in school . " Crane 's left eyebrow quirked . " Oh , that one ? I heard about it . Must have been pretty awful , your first night here . " " I got saved by the tramp athlete , " Craig laughed . " I 'm scared what 's going to happen to me when he graduates . I never had a nurse before , but this is a very good nurse . " " You do n't know the half about this boy , " Wilbur said . " Pour me a very little shot . I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old grads coming in and the boys at the house need some new furniture or something . No , Pete , you are looking at the only man in school who sleeps regularly with Jean Harlow . By the way , kid , how are you making out there ? " " She left me , " Craig said . " She has n't been hack since I went to Charleston . Maybe she do n't love me any more . " " She 's jealous of that Charleston rich-bitch , " Wilbur said . " You ca n't cheat on your women , Sonny , not even in a dream . Say , can anybodyfor crissake tie a tie ? " " I can , " Craig said . " I been practicing all day long . Here , hold still . " Jimmy Wilbur beamed at Pete Crane . " You see what I mean ? This is a very special kid . " " I do n't know what the hell you guys are talking about , but it would n't hold in court , " the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . Suppose you tell me for the record . " " Crane 's prelaw , " Wilbur said . " Stop jerking at the ends . It looks all right . All prelaw guys talk about records and things not holding in court . Practicing to be a shyster is a very difficult business  --  tougher than practicing to be a coach . Ah . . . perfect . You 'd make a wonderfulvalet , kid . " " What about this Jean Harlow thing ? " Wilbur sketched Craig 's vicarious amour with considerable profane embroidery . Crane laughed loudly . " We got to do something about our boy , " Wilbur said . " Apart from Miss Harlow he ai n't had no experience a-tall . What 's loose at the coed shack ? Anything noteworthy that the Dekes ai n't snapped up ? " " Not a damned thing . But there ought to be a few town gals around tonight . There 's one . . . No . I want her for me . I got seniority on that one . She 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two halves of watermelons with his hands . " Like they were cut in two and pasted on . Maybe we 'll find somebody 's sister for our young pal here . " " Not my sister ? " Wilbur threw up his hands in horror . " Not that ? " " Oh , I forgot , " Pete Crane said . " She 's still in the hospital with the Old Joe . Or was it a baby ? I guess we 'll have to send for my sister . She was cured a week ago . " " After the baby ? " " Of course after the baby . We had to get her married first . " " Who was dumb enough to marry her ? " " Me , of course . After all , she was my sister and it was my baby . " " You 're kiddin ' yourself , son . It was my baby . " " Suit yourself , " Pete Crane said . " As a matter of fact , it was twins and mine died . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sent your jug over to the house , kid . With a ribbon on it . " The conversation made no sense whatsoever to Craig , but it fused him with a wild feeling of belonging  --  to be kidded , to talk foolishness , to not be patronized , to be poked fun at  --  all this was different from the thing in Charleston , his home-corning to Kensington , his stiff afternoon at the house of John Grimes . This was the Craig Price who had a Tux , who could tie a black tic , who could listen to had jokes about nonexistentsisters , who could drink corn likker and be one of the boys , who was going to a party . . . " Where do you come from ? " he asked Pete Crane . " Little town outside of Asheville . Waynesville . Nothing you ever heard of . It 's famous for two or three things --  - my Uncle Ned who is the best square dancer in western North Carolina , the azaleas , and the drunkest Cherokee Indians known to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck of the woods a lot better . You can get mighty tired of moun-tains . " " Let 's move , " Wilbur said . " Will we take your limousine , Craig , or mine ? " " Oh , let 's everybody take his own Cadillac , " Craig said . " I prefer my horse , " Crane said . " These newfangled gasoline buggiessmell so bad . " They walked out into the crisp , star-dappled night . The winterwearybare trees stood lean like distant etchings against the winter sky , and the campus buildings bulked large , like huge friendly animals . Craig said , suddenly : " You know what I feel like tonight ? Do n't laugh . It 's the same way I used to feel when I 'd sneak out of the house in New Truro to run off to a colored camp meetin ' . Kind of a Sundaygo-to-meetin ' feeling . Like something good was going to happen but you did n't know just what . " " I know what you mean , " Pete Crane said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know much about camp meetin 's , but a square dance night is something to see . People come from all over the Smokies , and they tune up the fiddles and turn on the mountain dew . The fire 's bright and nobody 's mad at nobody . It 's like going back to the way it was when the first settlers came in . They still speak a good110part Elizabethan English , and all the square-dance songs are old Englishsongs . When I was a little kid , sort of crouched off in the corner where nobody 'd notice me , when they started a reel I kind of looked around to see if Sir Walter Raleigh had showed up yet . He never did , of course , but the feeling was like he just might if I watched real hard . " " Us Polacks ai n't so romantic , " Jimmy Wilbur laughed . " We just tie babushkas over our heads and get drunk on potato whisky and fight . Or cry . Somebody gets hold of a guitar and begins to wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before long everybody 's crying . What the hell they 're crying about I do n't know . I asked my old lady once and she said : We 're crying because we 're so happy . ' Well , here we are . Let us go and meet the noble brothers of the Phi Gamma Delta lodge . Somebody hit me if I get drunk . This is **26;1671;TOOLONG night and I would n't want the visiting grads to get the wrong idea of Brother James , otherwise known as Moose , Wilbur . That ai n't what they pay me for . " Craig felt only a moment 's shyness as they walked into the great hall . A record player was going in the next room and it was ' Fed Fiorito playing " Willow Weep for Me . " There was a scent of crushed pine needles , wood-smoke odor from the snapping blaze in the huge fireplace  --  asmell of whisky and cigarette smoke and of perfumed female flesh . It was a festive smell , mixed of music and women and whisky and clean people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughter mounted over the music , which had suddenly switched to " A Faded Summer Love . " Twenty-five years after Craig Price left the University a sudden sight , a sudden smell was able to reproduce almost to the minute some experience or person with an accompanying song . Her name was Mary Frances . She was just sixteen . She was with her brother , Mark . She had come over for the weekend from the girls ' school , Peace , in Raleigh . She was a large girl , tall , with a mature woman 's body and storm-tossed black hair . Her skin was that gardenia white only the Irish seem to achieve , with almost purple eyes and a wide , rich happy red mouth . She was dancing with her brother when the music stopped and Moose Wilbur said : " Hey , Mark I want you to meet a friend of mine . He looks mighty lak ' a pledge . Craig Price , Mark Malone . And . . . " He turned to the girl . " Hi . " Malone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Frances Malone . She 's over for the weekend . I smuggled her out of Peace , which ai n't a mean feat . Said Ma was dying . This is Moose Wilbur , our most famous brother , and Craig Price . From where ? " " Kensington . " " We are n't so far away . Goldsboro . Neighbors , practically . How ' bout a charge , Moose ? I got a jug in my room . You kids want to dance while the grownups fade away ? " " Sure , " Craig said , uneasily . " If Miss Malone . . . " 111The girl looked at Craig and smiled . " I 'd like to , " she said . " My brother 's been trying to get rid of me all night . If you do n't mind . . . " ( ' raig did n't know why he said it , but he blurted , " I 'm glad I 'm not your brother , " as she slipped into his arms . Ile would never forget that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because Miss Mary Frances Malone said : " So am I. " The evening blurred , and Craig met most of the brethren who seemed nice , and most of the alumni who seemed nice  --  and drunkand a plethora of pretty girls . Craig needed nothing more to drink , beingalready drunk with Mary Frances Malone in his arms . Their conversation was compounded of all the cliches manufactured since young love became popular . " You dance very well , Craig , " she said . " I do n't even know I 'm dancing , " ( ' raig answered . " I 'm flying . " " How old are you ? " " Sixteen . How old are you ? " " Sixteen . " " Can I please come see you on date night in Raleigh ? " " If you want to . Yes . " " Where are you going to school after you finish at Peace ? " " I want to come here . But it 'll take two more years before they let me . Also Bud  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . I would n't want to cramp his style . Having a kid sister in school would . " They danced inadvertently toward a side room , where a small fire flickered . " Let 's sit and smoke a cigarette . Do you smoke ? " Craig steered her to a sofa . " A little . But I do n't inhale . " He lit two cigarettes . " Could I get you a drink ? " " Thanks . I do n't . . . yet . Mark says it 's not nice , and the boys do n't like it . " " Then I wo n't . Look , Mary Frances , I 'm not a fraternity man , but . . . " " But that does n't make any difference . But what ? " " Would you . . . would you come over for the Spring Frolics ? Asmy girl , I mean ? I know I have n't known you very long , but I sort of feel I have and . . . " " And ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig made a swift resolution to steal a gun and stick up a bank and conquer the world , if necessary . " And there 'd be your brother . I mean for . . . to chaperone you , I mean . " Mary Frances Malone smiled , and Craig felt suddenly blinded . " I 'd love to , " she said , and held up her flower face to be kissed . 112It had come softly spring . It sneaked in as slick as a thief . One day the trees were bone-gaunt and obscenely naked . The remnants of old and coal-dusted snow filled small crevices in the wet red clay , trembling close against the clammy stones . The winds rapped impatiently , nervouslyat the door . Now the blossoms burst . The peach trees rippled with bloom , and from the Arboretum all the smells stole rides upon the gentle breeze and crept inside the nostrils . The tiny shoots , fulfilled , blurted into tenderleaves . Sap burst in jewels on the trees . Suddenly birds , long winter gone , arrived in song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , the young grass , even the feeling of the black night was green  --  not the sweaty lushness that would come with summer and its heavy smells , but the first intimation of new gentle time , as hesitantly soft as a baby 's kiss . Craig had flunked Math Two that past winter quarter . lie could not seem to focus his mind on calculus . It kept getting all confused with purple eyes and jet-black , web-soft hair , and skin so soft and white that all the sines and cosines and symbols and stuff kept merging into a simple formula : " If M to the second power equals Price , then I am in love . " There was a deep-buried intangible quality in Mary Frances  --  a quality he sought the rest of his life . She was enduringly gentle and simply loving . She was not , even at a time when young women worked at it , cute . The Irish honesty of her uncomplicated self forestalled cuteness . She practiced no wiles  --  she owned no professional woman 's tricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grail dance or around to the Zeta Beta Tau house , where he had made a great many friends . The Zetes were Jews . It had never occurred to Craig that Jews were different from anybody else . In his own home town they were portion to the aristocracy of the city . That they observed the Sabbath on Saturday did not seem unusual , nor was the presence in some houses of the milc  --  hhkedikh and fleishkedikh eating utensils , one for flesh , the other for dairy products . He loved the rich Jewish food , the noodles and the matzoth balls swimming in the chicken fat , the stuffed gefulltc fish , and the rich desserts . The word Jew meant no more to him than the word people , or that somebody was blond or brunette . He had never heard the words Kike or Sheenie until he was exposed to the Northerners who came to Chapel Hill to take advantage of the cheap tuition . Jimmy Wilbur took him over to the Zetc house one night . The Zetes were throwing a party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dormitory , sharing the corn-squeezings in Wilbur 's room . This man , Jules Francovich , was possibly the only nonprofessional athlete on the football team . He played football for fun , and was the best left end in the Southern Conference . He was a lean , savagely handsome , olive-tinted boy from New York , who moved as sleekly113purring as a cat , and whose black eyes and smooth hair gave him a Valentino stamp . He was enormously rich without making a display of it . He had a huge custom-built Auburn roadster that he very seldom bothered to drive . His father was a stockbroker in New York , and Jules ' personal headlines in the Times , when he blocked a punt or nailed a ball carrier behind the man 's own goal line , had built him into a new-god in his father 's collection of household deity . Jules met Craig in Wilbur 's room and asked him to the party . It was only a routinely quiet Saturday night , but Craig felt he had never met so many nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called King Kong , a massive man who played first-string guard  --  an impossiblyugly fellow with low-hanging arms and a gorilla 's heft , who was as gentle as a dove and who was generally besieged by the village childrenwhen he walked the streets . There was a kid of Craig 's age named Mike something , whose father was a theatrical producer . There was another named Lou , whose father was an artist . With the exception of King Kong , whose Louis Wolheim face made him almost beautiful , they composed a tribe of handsome , lithe , well brought up , genial people , and Craig immediately had a warm feeling of home-coming . They laughed easily and possessed an indolent , unstudied grace of family . Their women  --  girl friends and sisters --  -- were invariably seemly , and were fragrant with a lush Oriental opulence . ' I hey were jolly girls , possiblya little pouter-pigeon plumper than the other girls about the campus , but quicker to smile , more eager to be " nice . " There was no coquetryto combat . And the fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little short fat ones and the tall spare ones , all seemed to share an enormous sense of fun with their sons and daughters when they came calling on a weekend . They swept Craig into a blanket embrace . It was not very long before lie found himself dropping in on the Zete house at all sorts of odd hours , and he was ever welcome and he never thought of himself as " goy . " The time for Spring Frolics had nearly come . Craig went to Mark Malone and asked formal permission to bid Mary Frances for the dances . " They 're having a weekend party at the Zeta Beta Tau house , " Craig said . " The boys are all moving out . Would you mind if your sister  --  if Mary Frances  --  stayed there ? They 're . . . they 're Jews . . . " Malone grinned . He put a casual hand on Craig 's shoulder . " I 'm Irish . My old man was a hod carrier before he turned crooked and got rich . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely some of my best friends are Jews . You know who I 'm having down for the Hop ? Francovich 's sister , Sarah or I should say , Sally . If I 'm real lucky I 'll marry her . That 's if she has n't got any race prejudice about micks . Let 's see if Jules ca n't put our two girls in together , and why114do n't you come over here and stay for the weekend ? You like this kid sister of mine , huh ? " Craig smiled , almost through sudden tears . He had been meeting too many nice people lately , and still was n't quite used to it . " If I 'm lucky I 'll marry Mary Frances . That 's if she has n't got any prejudices against Protestants . " " Welcome to the lodge , " Mark Malone said . " But promise me one thing . If you ever do get married , promise me you wo n't start all the kids ' names with M. My old man 's got a phobia about M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Monte . Madeleine . Christ . If I marry Sally 1 suppose 1 ' 11 have to name the first - boy Max , just to keep the tradition going . " Mark Malone paused a thoughtful moment . He poked very gently at Craig 's chest with his right forefinger . " Price ? " " Huh ? What ? " " I 'm kind of fond of Mary F. You 're both real young kids . If you do anything at all to this kid , anything at all , I 'll kill you . Painfully as pos- sible . " " I would n't mind if you did . I 'd rate it . Or I might even save you the trouble and do it myself . " " You 're a good lad , " Mark Malone said . " The boys have been talk- ing . You like to pin yourself up Phi Gam ? They 'd like to have you . " " I ca n't this year . No dough . But there 's nothing 1 'd like better . Maybe next fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 'd make it easy for you . You could wait tables , maybe , or look after the accounting , or something like that . . . " " Thanks a hell of a lot . But I 'll come when I can pay my way like anybody else . But thank the guys , will you , and if the offer 's open next year . . . well , thanks , Mark . " In a life , of a life , there is possible perfection . Craig touched magic that weekend . Maybe there were other people around  --  at the Zete house , at the Phi Gams , in the Tin Can , necking in the Arboretum , strolling on the campus , dancing , singing , drinking milk punch at the K.A . ' s , playing records at the Sigma Chi 's , morning beer with the Phi Kaps  --  Hal Kemp playing the tea dance and nobody ( lancing but just swaying and listening . And there was always Mary Frances  --  beautiful , quiet , unaffected Mary Frances  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone for the afternoon to the big lake . The sun warmed them , sieving through the leaves , and the birds discreetly sang . They stretched , dripping from a swim , on the crisp young grass and quite suddenly fell to kissing . The salty-sweet smell of wet , sun-warmed woman suddenly got tangled with a clean cloud of black hair and wide red mouth acrid with want , with purple eyes rolled backward , with the feel of petal skin , with small pocket of purest honey where the neck115joined shoulder where all the sweetness was , the intimate delightful crook of inner elbow , the plump bulge of inner thigh , all the wondrous nooks and crannies which spelt sugar and spice . . . " I 'm sorry , " Craig said . " I did n't want . . . I mean I did n't mean to . I mean I do n't know what I mean . Except I 'll love you all my life . I . . . do you suppose we better get married and I 'll get a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pulled him down and kissed him , then turned swiftly and kissed him once again , her hair falling in a soft shower over his face . " Silly . We ca n't get married for a long time . Let 's just play like we 're married . And there wo n't be a . . . a baby . Not for the first time . You know something ? I always thought it would hurt . It did n't . It felt . . . lovely . " Craig was suddenly stricken by a fresh guilt . " I promised your brother I would n't . . . I promised him . I meant it , too . " An ancient female wisdom , and even more ancient female amusement , lit Mary Frances ' eyes . She laughed and it was a joyous laugh . " Do n't you suppose Mark and Sally are in the same sort of trouble with each other this very , very moment ? Idiot boy . ( ' ome kiss me sweet , silly , and shut up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the l'hi ( ham house , after kissinghis girl good night with a new powerful knowledge , his last thoughts before drifting into sleep were : And to think I used to be in love with Jean Harlow . I 'm only sixteen years old and I got at least fifty more to be in love with Mary Frances Malone . The jealous gods ruin happiness held firmly in the hand , lodged deeply in the heart , starkly graven in the brain . This was the reason for it . It was possibly the fault of the drunks . Craig went into the bathroom at the Inn . He had just seen Mary Frances off in her brother 's car , looking over her shoulder with a flung kiss , and he was heading back to his dormitory room to be beautifully alone with his love , to savor and caress it far from human view . He wanted nothing more than to think about the fifty years he could devoteall his time to being in love with Mary Frances Malone . He opened the door and heard a blurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rushing water , the whiskyed voice said : " I saw little Hot Pants over here . You ever try that ? You know who I mean . Mary Frances Moynihan . . . no , some other Irish name or other . . . Mulligan . No , hell , you know . Goes to Peace in Raleigh . Brother 's a Phi Gam . They tell me she . . . " " You mean the Malone girl . Her brother 's a nice guy . " " Yeah , but Ted Thompson said . . . " The voice dwindled to a hum , and again there was the sound of a flushed toilet . " But my God , she 's only a kid . " " Does n't make any difference . Ted said . . . " 116Craig turned swiftly and walked away . His first impulse to strangle both unseen voices sagged sickly in his stomach . He did not want to see their faces . He had only fifty years to be in love with Mary Frances Malone , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of a remembered face in class , on the campus , in the drugstore . It was all a lie , a filthy lie , the guys were drunk , stinking drunk , it was all a lie , a lousy lie , the guys were drunk , guys always talked , guys always bragged , guys always gossiped , it was all a lie the guys were drunk a lie drunk . . . But . She seemed to know an awful lot about what she was doing . And I did n't . I was the virgin , Craig 's head said . I was the one that did n't know what to do . The guys were drunk . Stinking drunk . Drunk guys talk a lot . All lies . Maybe they tried and could n't . You know how drunks are . You know what liars are like . Liars like Philip . Drunks lie . Drunks brag . A lie . Remember Philip and the clap he never caught ? He prowled his room in a fit of sudden rage , too long withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter inside him to compute  --  and smashed his fist into the plaster wall of his dormitory room . The wall was his enemy . He attacked the wall again , until the knuckles of both hands were battered , bleeding . Then he lay down on his bed , careless of the bloody hands , insensitiveto outside pain , his belly twisting , and did not weep . By God , they were right . Four days later he knew it . Ile had it . He had to have it . Everything his mother said had told hint he had it . What the drunks said told him he had it . There was that itching , the burning , the discharge . And she had been such a wonderful , girl , too . It could n't be possible that Mary Frances had given him  --  you had to face the dirty word  --  the clap . The plain old clap . Not that sweetly held body , not that yearning face , not those lips which blotted out all thinking . Gonorrhea ? Great God . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed . He raced to the infirmary . It was midnight , the sky brooding black , plumped with lowering clouds , a moon peeping , a flicker of heat lightning to the west . Sweat stood in little hills on his forehead . He was acutely conscious of his groin where an ache , an itch , a conscience had suddenly come to live . The night nurse was impatient . She was a horse-faced woman who looked more like a policeman than a woman . " The doctor 's asleep , " she said . " Come see him in the morning or tomorrow afternoon during his regular hours . There 's nothing wrong with you . Not that I can see . " She sniffed . She reminded Craig of Miss Caroline . " But there is , there is , " Craig said desperately . " I got to see the doctor . I got to him now . Now . " Some fierce urgency strode his voice . " Now . I got to see him now ! " " You 'll him at your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's hadthree deliveries today and an appendectomy . I would n't trust his117 " What 's your name , Doctor ? Do n't tell me . Just go ahead and screw what you can catch . If you collect a bug come see me , but do n't let it spoil the fun . I had the clap three times when I was an intern , and every time it was a nurse . Quit worrying . It wrecks the sport . That 'll be two dollars . After hours . " Craig paid him . The doctor looked at the bills as if they were a new culture under a slide . He shook his head , and handed them back to Craig . " I suggest , " he said , " that you run over to Durham and get yourselfproperly laid . Be my guest . Maybe your girl friend will like you better as a result . Good night , son . " Craig sang loud as he walked back to the dormitory , his fears assuaged , his.symptoms abated . He was singing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of a sudden he stopped in midverse . His mother 's image floated past his eyes , and behind it was a succession of lectures , a succession of glossy prints in obstetrical textbooks , an unendingflood of venereal close-ups in surgical v9lumcs . " Goddamn her , " he said softly to himself . It was the first time in his life he had ever used the words goddamn as an intended curse . And then he thought about Mary Frances Malone , sang no more , and wished he actually had the clap . It would have made the breakoff easier. chapter 9A horn tooted dah-dah-de-dah outside the dormitory , and Craig looked out the open window . The blue Cord was parked just at the corner and Mr. John Grimes of Kensington , N.C. , was leaning on the horn . Craig stuck his head out and yelled : " Do n't wear it out ! I 'll he right down ! " He rushed down the hall and took the steps three at a clip . " I sure did n't expect to see you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed immediately that John Grimes looked older , very tired , and his once smoothly distributed fat now hung on him like pods , giving him almost an appearance of skinniness surrounded by loose bunches of flesh . " Get in the car and let 's go to the Inn , " Grimes said . " I got a suite "  --  he pronounced it soot  --  " there . Wanta talk to you . I was in Raleigh119temper if you wake him . He lives next door , " she said suddenly , with a toss of the head . " Over there . " " Thank you , " Craig said , and dashed out of the door . The doctor was not pleased . Ilk hair was ruffled and his face was bloated , sleep-scarred , seamed and puffed under the eyes . He was wearing a ratty , red-flannel dressing gown over his pajamas , and his feet had been hurriedly shoved into sloppy run-over slippers . Alcohol clothed him . His name was McNab . " Do n't tell me you 're pregnant . " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in , come in , for Christ sake , come in ! Leprosyor what , at this hour ? " " Doctor , I . . . I . . . " The doctor , McNab , grinned suddenly , a foxy grin , a conspirator 's grin . " Unbutton your pants . Strange as it seems , I was young once myself . Whore ? " " No , sir . A nice girl . That 's why . . . that 's why I ca n't . . . that 's why . . " They 're all gray in the dark , me brave bucko . And the spirochete has no sense of social values . That applies to his cousin too . One lurks in the mucous , the other tackles the blood stream . I should imagine you 're fretted about the mucous . Old Charlie ( lap . What symptoms ? " Craig stammered : " Well , it hurts to . . . it hurts to . . . " " Piss ? " " Yes , sir . And it itches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice sloppy circumcision you got there . You 'll find it handy when you get older . I lmnmm . Pretend you 're a cow and milk it for me . Nothing . Nothing there . Bend over . " The doctor took off his rubber gloves . " If you want to I can run a smear on you tomorrow . But it 's a waste of time . All you got , boy , is a case of overdeveloped imagination . Where 'd you pick up all this useless knowledge of symptoms ? " " My uncle 's a doctor . My mother . . . " " Oh , one of them , hey ? " The doctor spat into the flickering fire . " All about the birds and the bees and what 'll happen if you 're a bad boy ? Christ , if I could close my fist on half-smart females the sun would rise on a womanless world . " He paused . " First time ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well then goddamitlit , marry her if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so in town , and try not to knock her up . You look a little young to be a father . " " You 're absolutely sure I 'm all right ? How about the other ? The worst one ? " The doctor put a hand on Craig 's shoulder . He was elaborately sarcastic.
