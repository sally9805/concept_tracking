A clash over " legitimate newsgathering rights " resulted last week in a decision by U.S. , Canadian and European newsreel and TV film groups to boycott the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne . The newsreelers wanted to use up to nine minutes a day of footage filmed by their own cameras . But the Australians refused , fearing that the edge would be taken off commercial resale of Olympics movies . Instead , they offered to hand out three minutes of their own film daily to all comers . The film pool resented being limited to a handout , announced that they would make no movies of the Olympics for theaters or TV.
