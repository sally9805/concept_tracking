3 ... and then I walkedand walked in the rain that turned half into snow and I was drenched and frozen ; and walked upon a park that seemed like the very pasture of Hell where there were couples whispering in the shadows , all in some plot to warm the world tonight , and I went into a public place and saw annunciations drawn and written on the walls . I came out and felt alone and lost in the world with no home to go home to and felt robbed of everything I never had but dreamt of and hoped to have ; and mocked by others ' midnight victory and my own eternalfailure , un-named by nameless agony and stripped of all my history , I was betrayed again . Yet on the walls of my brain , frescoes : the kneeling balletic Angel holding a wand of vineleaves , announcing ; the agony in the garden ; two naked lovers turned out ; and over the dome of my brain Creations and Damnations , Judgments , Hells and Paradises ( we are carriers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private walls of the skull ? ) . p 4Then I was standing against the wet , cold wall of this building in the park and I slid down against the wet wall , wanting to die , squatting there in the dark . Faces glided past me up above me under the rainstreaked moon of a streetlight like prows of safe ships with somewhere to go  --  the rain on some was beautiful  --  and all around me they were meeting in the park and walking away under the dripping trees , figures were walking up and down upon the sodden leaves , and in my spell I thought , they are all passing me by , and I sink down , way below the faces , prows of ships . And then I heard the voices again ( Come home , the light 's on , come on home , Ben Berryben . I 'll be glad when you 've had enough and will come on home again , I 'm so blue and so upset , can hardly swallow water . . . . ) ( Swimma - a- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ) ( Rescue the Perishing ! ) ( Boy , Boy , come out to the woodshed I 've got somethin to show you , by gum . . . . ) ( Draw me , draw me , I will follow . ... In all your sunshines if you can remember one day any darkness , that will be me drawing you . . . . I have left Word in the darkness for you , the Word that was my flesh ( take that Wafer ) ; all darkness proclaims my Word  --  listen in the darkness and you will hear it. ) and I melted down like the gingerbread man that ran and ran and melted as he ran . I began to name over and over in my memory every beautiful and loved image I ever had , to name and praise them over and over like a rosary , bead by bead , saying , Granny Ganchion , I touch you and name you ; Folner , I touch you and name you , p 5Aunty , Malley , Swimma , Boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was like a procession through the rooms of the house , saying , now this is the hall and there is the bottled ship and the seashell , this is the breezeway , there is the well and here is the map in the kitchen and the watery mirror in which , behold , is my face , me , my face . . . . I cried out " 0 Charity ! " , so that those who heard me might have thought I was a beggar crying ; and wanted to die . . . . p 6What is it the windseeks , sweeping among the leaves , prowling round and round this house , knocking at the doors , and wailing in the shutters ? 0 Charity ! Every frozen morning for awhile in early winter you had a thin little winter moon slung like a slice of a silver Rocky Ford cantaloupe over the sawmill ; and then I would go out to the well in the yard and snap off the silver thorns of ice from the pump muzzle and jack up the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you where you lay like a storybook town , and know that on all the little wooden roofs of houses there was a delicate trail of lacelike rime on the shingles . Then all the chickens and guineas of Charity would be crowing and calling and all the cattle lowing , and the Charity dogs barking ( all with a sound that china animals might make if they could crow or call or low ) , and in that crystal and moonhaunted moment I would stand , dazzling in the first sunray of morning , and wonder what would ever happen to us all. p 7And on a spring Saturday you would be sitting there in your place in Texas " grinnin like a Chessy Cat " as Aunty said , so happy and hopping with all the people come in from the fields and farms to handle you and claim you and gather round in you  --  there was Glee Ramey and there was Sweet Climpkins and Sing Stovall and Ola Stokes , the music teacher ( " One day a little bubble will break in your throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just wait for the little bubble . " ) , and all the Grants , who had to ford White Rock Creek to get in from their blackland farm  --  and families all standing together here and there or carrying out oats and feed and cartons of Pet 's Milk from the Commissary . And in the still , clear dusks I remember especially a voice that sounded in you , Charity , resounding as in a cistern , calling " Swimma - a- a ! Swimma - a- a- a ! Come in ' fore dark ! "  --  Aunty calling Sue Emma , my cousin and her daughter ( no voice calling this name can ever call back Sue Emma to that fallen splendid house , and it grows dark . But Sue Emma , dancing or hunching in the dark , grinding in her own glitter 's ashes , might hear a calling voice within her that does not answer back ) . All my life since , in any place and for no reason at all , sometimes at dusk I will suddenly hear a voice calling " Swimma - a- a ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and wish we were all together in Charity again . You had a little patch of woods behind the house that I remember . It had bearded trees that clicked and ticked and cracked and cheeped and twittered and 8lichen grew on an ancient fence like an old old sheep 's coat ; and stroking it with my hand once made me feel how old and lusterless and napworn you might be , Charity , and all the people in you , just as Aunty said . But to see an old live oak drop a single young little leaf twinkling to the ground was to know that there was still the shining new thing of myself in the world and I would be filled with some passion for something , bigger than Aunty 's hopelessness , bigger than Granny Ganchion 's agony , than all Charity  --  until suddenly I would hear the groaning of the cisternwheel back at the house , calling me back , and I would go . You were such a place of leaves , Charity ; and I think the first time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a deep and sad and heavy autumn . Then you seemed to have been built of leaf and twig and bark , as a bird 's nest is woven and thatched together , and had been used and used until you were withered ; then you were shaken and thrown down into these ruins . All the summer of anything that had ever touched or known you seemed despoiled and was rubble that autumn , and I suddenly knew myself as something , moving and turning among these remnants . ( Oh all the leaves I have known in you , Charity !  --  the shining leathery castorbean leaves , with the chickenscool under them in the summer or sheltered from the rain ( oh the sound of the rain on the castorbean leaves , how forever after Folner 's funeral that sound reminded me of the funeral ) . ) And the lace and grace of chinaberry leaves in a summer breeze ; and those ofp 9the vines that had a name I did not know and hung , full of bees or busy hummingbirds all after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front gallery of the house . Then of course the live-oak leaves , that were flaked over Charity Riverbottom ; and muscadine leaves and sycamore leaves and the leaves on go-to-sleep flowers . ( In the autumn of one year , every leaf that had ever hung on any Charity tree in spring and summer lay fallen upon the ground and I moved and turned through the wreckage like an unhung leaf that would not lie down nor wither . ) In you , Charity , there stands now , as in the globed world of my memory there glimmers the frosted image of it , blown by all these breaths , the fallen splendid house , sitting on the rising piece of land , out of which all who lived and lost in it have gone , being dispossessedof it : by death , by wandering , by turning away . And the house appears , now , to be an old old monumentin an agony of memory of us , its ruined friezes of remains , full of our speech , holding our things that speak out after us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us to give it back its language and so find his own . ( But I think how our worlds  --  like this house  --  hold us within them like an idea they might be having or like dreams they are dreaming , where our faces are unreal , worn blurred stone faces of ancient metopes of kin , caught in soundless shapes of tumult , wrestling with invasion of some haunted demon race , half-animal , half-angel  --  O agony of faces without features like faces in fogs of dreams of sorrow and horror , worn holes ofp 10mouths opened , calling cries that can not be heard , sayingwhat words , what choked names of breath that must be heard ) And to find out what we are , we must enter back into the ideas and the dreams of worlds that bore and dreamt us and there find , waiting within worn mouths , the speech that is ours . For now in this autumn when all the young are ceaselessly walking up and down under the falling trees , trying to make themselves real , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost claws clutching the earth that fed them , weaving and winding myself to myself , binding the lost leaf back to the tree . For all that is lost yearns to be found again , re-made and given back through the finder to itself , speech found for what is not spoken. p 11To get to the house , Charity , if I had been in town , I would just start walkingtoward the sawmill , down Main Street ( which was really only the Highway named this for the short time it ran through you and became a little piece of you ) under all the Charity trees . I would pass the only stores you had , looking across Main Street at each other ; and ahead of me would stretch the Highway , going to pretty close little towns like Lufkin and Lovelady , and behind me it wound to faraway places , huge and full of many people , like Dallas or Santone . Then I would turn off at the twisted cedar , in whose brnches I had been as often as any bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where once I slipped and hung like Absalom until Mrs. Tanner came running to save me ; then there would be the sawmill , where my father worked ( the men urinating in the lumberstacks )  --  and came home with sawdust in his pockets and shoes  --  that had a long , legged sawdust conveyor sitting like a prayingmantis . And next would come the graveyard , noth- p 12ing but names and dates and enormous grasshoppers vaulting over the graves ; and the little Negro shacks next , with black faces at the windows or some good old Negro sitting on his front gallery or calling to little Negrochildren playing in the mudpuddles , and a rooster crowing somewhere , after the rain . Finally I would take the sandy road , my feet barefooted and glad in it , stand by the Grace Methodist Church where it always seemed I could hear the voice of Brother Ramsey inside saying " Blessed are the peacemakers , for they are the children of God , " and then if I suddenly looked up , after thinking into the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at me like a face of a sleepingbird ( the cisternwheel would be its tail over it ) , and calling me back to it , home . It was a big , wide , live house with a long hall running right through the middle of it , and had many people in it , Aunty , Uncle Jimbob , Aunt Malley , Uncle Walter Warren , Christy , Granny Ganchion and all the cousins , little and big : Swimma , Follie , Berryben , Jessy , Maidie and all  --  even Miss Hattie Clegg , who came to live with us . There was always that wagon in the field ; it had lost a wheel and was standing broken at the back and wrenched to one side . A family of chipmunks lived and bred and lived on in it . Close to the outdoor well was the babybuggy , ragged and decrepit , like the sloughedoffhusk of abandoned infancy , in which many babies had been fitted and ridden round ; and later , when there were no more babies in the house , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recklessly , as if disdain-p 13ful of any infancy , until Aunty had captured it again and planted some Hen-and-Chickens in it . If it was winter , the cattle would be standing in a stare in the fields , dull and motionless ; and the ragged hens would be huddled drooping by the barn . Then it seemed that summer might not ever come again ( and Jessy played her jacks in the hall or sang for one of her sick dolls , " Mama , Mama , I am sick , run for the doctor quick quick quick ! " ; and I gazed at the picture of the sorrowfulgirl sitting playing her lyre on the side of the world ) . But summer or winter , turning and turning over it all like a blessing or a curse ( or sometimes blowing as if it were trying to blow the house down ) was the whirling wheel at the cistern . You had other places , Charity  --  the little Bijou ( said " Byejo " by everybody ) Theatre , bright and rowdy , where Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the show  --  mostly one piece called " Whispering , " over and over again . And you had the City Hotel  --  but that burned and brought all Charity to it in nightgowns and out of its wreckage they carried an old charred drummer burned in the praying shape they found him in  --  and I would never go this way to town again , to smell the rain on burnt woodash and flesh . Then there was the Postoffice , where the faces of Sam and Birdie and old Bill Grady were framed in each window like a mantel array of family photographs as I passed , going to get the mail . And there was the Racket Store and Sam Brown 's Dry Goods Store that had the smell of cretonne and gingham and Union Jack over-p 14alls in it , and old Mrs. Huffman with a pair of scissors hanging on a black ribbon round her neck saying , " Kin I hep ye , Boy Ganchion ? " . All these years , Charity , that I was in you , crystal dazzling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , reflecting everything and wondering , I never said anything , but only waited for some speech that the breath of the house was breathing into me . In memory the image of these days in you is what happenedonce on Main Street when a bunch of boys was standing round telling about things and suddenly one of them pointed out of the circle and called , " Look ! Standin there listenin with 's mouth open ! " and they all looked and laughed . It was me , suddenly aware of myselflooking , that they were pointing and laughing at ; and I went on away , then , thinking , I ' 11 go home to the house ; I have a place to go . ' For there was not a thing to say . Within the house you held , Charity , and in the hail that led to the breezeway there lay , propping open the door to the breezeway in summer and , cold to touch and of no use at all in the corner in winter , the seashell that Swimma brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil was on the property she brought it as a present from Florida to her mother , Aunty . On it was written PLAYGROUND OF THE WORLD . This was all she ever gave her mother . Summer and winter , doorstop or just seashell , it always had the little roar of the sea in it . Sometimesp 15I found Aunty sitting with it at her ear and once I saw Christy whisper into it ; and one of the few words he ever said to me was when he held it out to me once and said " Listen ! " ( One time when Swimma was in high school I saw Aunty after her because Swimma had a note in her hands that she would n't let Aunty see . They ran out of Aunty 's room through the hall and onto the breezeway , Swimma yelling , " It 's none of your business what I have or do ! " and Swimma ran to the well and threw the note in . Then she had her tantrum and ran out into the yard , chickens shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of them ; and she stayed away all afternoon . She came back late , from town where she had been , and Aunty looked out to see her coming and said , " Well yonder comes Miss Priss ; I vow to you I do n't know what we 're goin to do with her . " Swimma prissed in home , through the gate , with her lipstick on and walking as if she had on highheels , and said to Aunty on the gallery , " I hoped you 'd thought I 'd run away , is what I 'll do one day , too , sure 's Satan . " Then she came in and sat on the bench in the hall and gazed at herself in her mirror , making kissing shapes with her lipsticked lips and doing her lips around as if she were saying " 00000 ! " and rocking her head as if she were whispering " hotcha ! "  --  a word she was always saying around the house , now . She all of a sudden got mad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke it into pieces there where the seashell lay afterp 16she brought it , yelling , " ' Why do I have to have this nose as long as a pineywoods rooter 's  --  and with a possiblewart comin like Mama 's ? Dang it I wish I had the gold earrings Eulaly Sanderson has on in town today , and all the money they cost , and she was goin to have a wart on her nose ! " Aunty just got up from her chair on the gallery and said in at the front door , " Seven years bad luck little feist , " for the broken mirror . ( Oh she had it , seven and more . ) ) There also lay in the hall , close to the seashell doorstop , a pale green turpentine bottle with a perfect little ship in it that Christy made one winter ( what was this man who made it ? ) . And in the hall there hung a picture of a blinded girl with a lyre , sitting on top of a blue , rolling world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . When I looked at this picture , it seemed that some voice in me was telling out a memory of the world , as though I had always known the world , in what past of mine , what dream ? I stood and looked and heard the song of the world that told of the splendor of itself , like an object created by all that happened in it , and of what was done in it through all its years : it sang out , in a voice like Jessy 's , frail and trembling , of fallings of angels , down from a red raging heaven like falling birds or leaves or dropped flowers ; of the first man and woman naked and yawning in a garden , their flesh speaking ( 0 for some intimacy of bodies speaking top 17each other , creating a language for the first time that would be the speech of all love in all the years  --  one simple sentence of touch and burst ) a language that would create and speak out into the world all passion and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of dumbness of speech  --  where there is no love there is no speech  --  and desire like speech unheard , and ecstasy like the murmuring and pouring out of the sentence , bring body to body and start a ceaseless murmuring , the turning of the wheel of blood , yearning and tiringand yearning again , eternally rising and falling . And the song sang of kings and falls of kings , and plots of princes ; princesses in grated towers and queens in love or sending out ships or causing battles for nations , and conquests of religions and building of stained jewels of churches ; of classes , riots and clashes of classes , and systemsdiscovered by one man for all ages , and laws and pacts and edicts . The singing was of architecture of great stone buildings standing in light and throwing down their shadows across swept spacious plazas , and of figures on the capitals of columns  --  doves and granite grapes and tongued gargoyles ; of painted and striped baubles of cities , glittering with loot of robbed wealth , built over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynastic houses and fortifications and monasteries . . . And over all this tumult of concourse of men alive in the years of the world had hung the same old sky as over you , Charity , with all the stories of stars in the constellations : Orion hunting eternally through the frozenp 18wastes and ices of the bottomlands of the firmament , the lights twinkling round his loins and girdling them , Bulls ; and Fishes ; the Seven Sisters coming up , clustered , like slow shot Roman Candle stars over Rob Hill ( just over there ! ) , a thrown moon over like a gleaming skull from the graveyard of centuries of moons ( thrown by what gravedigger 's hand ? ) or sometimes like the head of a laughing boy or a luminous fingernail-end of some moving pointing finger . In the kitchen , tacked on the wall by Christy , was a map of the world . Christy often sat at night ( and I sometimes with him ) and looked and looked at the map , almost as if he were talking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into himself as he looked . Sometimes he showed me that by looking a long time at the map and then closing your eyes , you could open them again and look out into Bailey 's Pastureand see there , radiant and throbbing , the lighted shape of the world . And sometimes it seemed on the map , as we looked , that the whole world was melting down and leaving drippings of the world on the map like melting ice on a floor . Then the world was melting down into me and into Christy and we were changed into the world . In the enormous fluid of universe , ice floes of countries were broken off and floating and Christy and I were floating like separate ( but bridged by some secret underwater island ) lands . We saw togetherthe brainshaped countries and livershaped countrieswhere the whole mapped world looked likep 19blooded lights of the dissected , opened out and pinned down body of the world as if it were an enormous fowl ; and then we saw green and orange seas with pearl chains of islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nations , of colored populations inhabiting like flocks of flowers  --  yellow or black or red  --  the fields of countries ; of wars and crusades , of all the languages speaking to one another ; and we saw places with rivers and named after the rivers ; and we knew that there were many countries and lands and that some , in the running out of many years ( " The years ! the years ! " Christy would whisper ) would famish and grow so used that ancient grapevines would not give one more grape , and die  --  but that then other countries , heretofore forest full of eyes and calls and beaks against bark , and fat breasts of unshot birds , and where cones lay like fruit and spores dropped and high high grasses shone in sunlight ; and floored with fresh soil ripe for roots and seeds in fields where seeds flew in the winds or were carried on hooves or tails or manes and dropped and watered by rains , planted and cultivated by no man ; where airs were full of flying seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found ( men see them from a peak , after long guessings of travelings ; or from a wide and brimming river which they had opened like a marriage with the curved prow of their ship named after Queens and sent by Queens ) and history go on . History got onto maps , Christy 's gaze said , because men searched and because men were lonely and because men wandered and found countries and brought , like bees orp 20winds or hairy carriers , the seeds home : in a box a tender frond in its soil , to be smoked or its fruit eaten ; a leaf , a dried blossom ; or rock-embedded ores ; or in a bottle water from a lake or a spring ; or cages of colored birds , a chained , aghast black man ; or teeth or tusks ; or a purse of precious stones . Here , tacked on this wall in the kitchen of the house you held , Charity , was the world 's body showing all the life in it ; and all the life was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , that the map had stamped there , which each of us held in his hands , turning it round to find the worlds that each of us had given to the other. 20 p 21When I first discoveredyour River , Charity , I had the song of the world sung into me by the map and the picture and , looking at the river , map and picture and river were singing togetherthe same story , of beginnings , and ages , and of movement through ages towards something , towards me . You had this little river , Charity , that scalloped round your hem like a taffeta ruffle . It glided through your bottomlands ( that could be seen from the gallery of the house ) winking with minnows and riverflies and waterbugs . It was ornamented with big , drowsy snapturtlessitting like figurines on rocks ; had little jeweled perch in it and thick purple catfish shining in it and sliding cottonmouth watermoccasins . It crawled , croakingwith bullfrogs and ticking and sucking and clucking and shining , round through meadows of bottomland palmettos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in July Prayer Meeting ) , between muscadine vines that plashed up like fretted fountains ( and trailed and curled and twined over the ground and crept over p 22old stony logs and ancient saffron-golden rotted wood festered with the decoration of pink and white and azure fungusflowers , and climbed up trees and coiled round their branches and then were flung down again in tassels and sprays and thick swags over the river ) , under purple hangings of moss and under bridges of many little towns until , somewhere far away from you , Charity , in a place you did not know but only imagined , it swam into a bay . O River ! You were our Time flowing wrinkled and ceaseless over stones and roots , sliming or mossing or eroding them as Time passes over people and their houses and objects , touching them with a ghostly invisiblehand and changing them  --  see its work on the face , the hair , the body : mossing and wrinkling and eroding . You were a kind of Beulah Land for everybody : people gathered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to be treacherous after rains and in your deep places , where it was quietest , were dread suckholes sometimes marked by the warning of a whirlpool , but not always . For a fording wagon full of the Chubbs from Elmina had sunk into one of them and all were drowned and people all along in the towns of Onalaska and Pointblank and Camilla found bodies coming along , now of the baby , now of Ora Bee Chubb , now of the two boys , floating by ; and although they waited and watched for Selmers Chubb , he never passed and it was guessed that he was caught in a snag . Others drowned in you , too  --  three Charity girls almost did while wading and squealing and one of them did andp 23this was Otey Bell , rescued by Christy Ganchion , but too late . They rolled her over a log but she was drowned . You had live bodies of bathers jumping in you in the summers ; and waders ; and seiners and rowers . If somebody stood looking at his image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a black flame or a black torch , furling and unfurling . You seemed wicked , too , for once , on a fishing trip with some uncles and other men , I had lain listening all night to a conversation against the stitching call of katydids about women and certain Charity women ; and then one man had said ( it was Christy , my uncle ) while he thought I was asleep , that he wondered if I had any hairs down there yet and drank his homebrew and said let 's wake him up to see , and chuckled . I had lain trembling and waiting for them to come , knowing they would find what they came to see , quite a few , and lovely golden down , and they had been my secret ; but they never came , only made me feel a guilt for secrets . And you could make one feel terror , River ; for men , as men will in any place at times , had turned suddenly hostile towards men along your moist sides , on hunting trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunters  --  like the time of the hunting trip that I was forced to go on and was almost shot because I had cracked a pecan off to myself in the woods , standing in the lemongreen light of trees , and the hunters had crept upon me and aimed at the cracking noise I made , like a squirrel they hunted , and would have shot if I had p 24not emerged just at the moment from the thicket and looked , pitiful and pitifully , at them . Then they cursed and turned upon me and turned upon each other because they were tired and a bit drunk and the sun was hot and there was a boy who did not want to hunt , not even to shoot his niggershooter , but only crack his nuts , alone , and foil them . You had spectral pools standing still close to you , full of their secret life , like your hidden otherlife  --  ringed in November by gray , luminous trees whose wiry branches were like tangled strands of steel ; and mauve and amber and russet ferns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat haunted , colored birds . In summer the rich pond water was a vat of ripe simmeringfruit , of varnish color : golden in the sun , holdinglike a rich syrup all the stock and plankton of the woods : loam-wealth , growth richness , leaf and sap goodness , the potlikker of the secret woods  --  all untouched and rare and gamy . There lolled fat , torpid , safe fish , bobbling languorously over in the thick piny syrup , bubblingtheir rubbery globules , like plump ripe fruit in their juices . Then the summer deep green growth of enormous ferns , dropping their quiet spores beneath themselves , and brambled , locked berrybushes with swollen , flaming berries , safe again , except from beak and tooth ; and mayhaw and muscadine vines and ambushedsnakes lying hot-bodied and dozing , their fluent eyes the mirrors of berry and frond and watersparkle , or slipping through the maidenhair . There also were un-p 25anxious frogs with half-closed eyes and throbbing throats ; and the noise of the heat in the steaming woods was a kind of heart-sound or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crickets . But in the deep winter the brown Indian skin of ice lay over the pond and a bird might walk on the water like an apostle . Yet they said that the Devil walked in the bottomlands . In your bottomlands , which you kept moist and lush ( except in droughts that dried you up and shamefully showed your white fishbelly of muscled sand and your green rippled ribs of shining treeroots ) , there lived a bunch of Negroes and they were called the Riverbottom Nigras . Your Riverbottom Nigras lived in little shotgun houses with a clappety porch and a swept dirt yard and a flowerbed neat as a flowered bonnet , bordered with green and amber bottles or fruitjars . They grew some vegetables  --  one could see the tincans over the tomato plants in the spring  --  and some of them worked across at the Fuller 's Earth Mill or the women came to Charityhouses and washed and ironed the Charity clothes . But a lot of them mostly just fished in you . Nearly every year you rose up , swollen with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flood them out , ruined their vegetables and rotted their porches and twisted their steps ; but your Riverbottom Nigras waited until you shrank back into your bed , pulling their vegetables back with you and scattering the fruitjars and cans , and p 26then they went quietly back and cleaned up your rivermessand leavings and made their places nice again . Your Nigras knew your bottomlands like their own rooms , knew your good fishing places and where there was white sand and safe hiding places for escaped convictsfrom Huntsville . They knew when mosquitoes were coming , by wind or lack of wind , and when rattlesnakessloughed or were abroad . The Riverbottom Nigras had lost children in you , caught on fishhooks strange monsters from you that were sent by the Devil , bathed in you and sung along you . Lovers had met in your bottomlands , crapshooters snapped fingers around a secret fire , and killers had run to you and lain all night in some dense rushes where the Ku Klux might not find them . Yet above your bottomlands , River , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old pelt of scrub oak and crowned by burning crosses , where the Ku Klux Klan met and burned a Negro to remind them all along you that they were Negroes . You were my first river in the country of childhood and when I discovered you , from a hill in a blue , early morning , I saw you whispering along through the woods like the long and weaving Marchen of the woods murmuringhistory . Think of me then ( was what you were singing ) when I had never had a boat upon me or any net thrown or seine dipped into me , flowing only with moonlight or sunlight and all my swimming and breathingthings within my womb ( and such a thing as Char-p 27ity never existed ) ; and of my floods which I had ( and caused no dikes to be made nor any human alarm , only the terror of creatures who knew the visits , and endured them , of catastrophe and built rushnests again , afterwards , moved eggs in time or their young away ) , rolling over on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . And then when it was time , folded back again over upon myself , a shrunken , lighter lover , and fell back to my size and place and ran on again , in repose , to my bay . What I left upon the bottomlandsall could see  --  I left my sand in bars and wrote my designs and crystal shapes upon them and then birds ' feet made their marks with mine and paws of animalstheirs and snakes made smooth , crooked , wiped places with their bellies ( what man first found these and asked me what they meant ? ) and what I left on the bottomlands anyone could have ; but I fertilized the land with my sperm of fishes ' bones and algae and left crawfish and swollen rats and wooden cattle and all my lavish and manifold plankton , my mulch . Everything flows into everything and carries with it and within it all lives of its life and others ' life and all is a murmuring and whispering of things changing into each other , breeding and searching and reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over other , by boat or bridge or swimming , is to another side ; and whatever drowning is dying and sinking back into a womb , and what salvation or rescue of the perishing in waters or wickedness , dead or alive , is a union , of silence or rejoicing ; and to drop down into any of us , intop 28depths ( in river or self or well or cellar ) is to lower into sorrow and truth . But we are purged , to plunge beneath a flood is to lose all guilty stains and to rise is to be purified . And we are to keep turning the wheels we turn , we are wind we are water we are yearning ; we are to keep rising and falling , hovering at our own marks , then falling , then rising . ( Who can set a mark or measure us ? They can not name my tides or measure me by the marks drawn on a wall ; I hover . ) But let me tell you that if there is a call from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over , over ... You came , young boy from the House , to these woods with me running in them and you called out any name ( and I will never tell it ) and the woods held the name you called and trembled with the name and all the nests shook with it and berries swung with the calling like little bells , and flowers rocked the name like listening faces turning their ears to hear the name , and birds flushed up at the calling of the name ; and animals stopped where they were going and pricked their ears and heard and their ears held the name you called . You walked and thought of all those killed by their love and lovers , and you had none , of all lost causes of hunters and explorers , of all failures of men going after something , and said the words that the Mexicans say , 0 Dios , 0 Dios , 0 Dios , and wished and yearned for someone to lead you and to follow . And you knew that I , river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-p 29spread corruption and drouth , the flaccid land of the dead , and lain upon it and covered it with my sperm and brought up life from corruption ; that I crossed over my banks and went where there was nothing of me , where I was not , and left some of myself there . But there is the inevitable return , we are forever going out and coming in , joining and abandoning , alone and together . Once , when you were swimming , naked , it happened for the first time to you in me . Christy stood on the bank and told you and Berryben to jump in and touch my bottom and see who could come up to the top first ; and you were struggling to come up first , rising rising rising , faster , faster , when some marvelous thing that can happen to all of us happened to you , wound up and burst and hurt you , hurt you and you came up , changed , last to the top trembling and exhausted and sat down on my banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tried to make you jump into me again ) . You blamed it secretly on Christy , that he had made you feel like this , and were afraid of him for it . This was the way you learned what could happen to you , but not why ; like a clock that could wind up and chime in you down there . By me , in these woods , you once made up for what you never had , played your fingers over my hairy rockmossand lay against my sandstone and ached and cramped and burned and I know what happened there . Just you hard against my rock ; and in your trousers , all over you , hot and running like glue  --  you washed you inp30my waters ; and by my waters you lay down and wept , and slept , by me . From then on you were aware of the feeling water could make you have , 0 we were lovers , I had you rising and falling in me and you left something in me and it was mixed with my rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I cast your sperm mixed in my spume and sediment onto the land , the country of your beginnings , and we made it rich . ' What I taught you is that there must be a rising and a falling , a bursting and a casting out . All your family feared water , would not cross it on bridges , would not swim much in it ( but one drowned in it ) : cross it , love it , be water , you are river , I am you . And once , in my greatest flood when I was swollen huge and throbbing with all my fluid , I crept through Charity and through Bailey 's Pasture close to you and to your house and lay by you and by the house ( 0 we were joined again ) and heard within it all the murmuringsof the house , by the shuttered window , in the cellar , in the loft , in the kitchen by the map , and sang my duet with the girl on the world ; and you slipped out to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship in the bottle that I floated down and away onto the waters of the mapped world he looked at and became , and also dropped some Folner spangles and a stranger 's photograph and a string of ruby beads  --  and I received them all and mixed them in my substance , in my stuff . And I lay upon all the life of the people of the house left in the pasture : the sawdust , the bones of frozen and shot Roma the cow , the go-to-sleepp31flowers , the bitterweeds , the lost doll , the babybuggy ; I washed over all the footprints on the path of Folner and you and Berryben and Christy and Swimma ; saw Malley peeking at me through the shutter and watched all of you sitting on the front gallery together fearing me ; heard the grinding of the cisternwheel and heard the splashing of the dropped bucket in the well . And when I left the pasture you know what I left : what you left in me and I brought back to you and to your pasture , 0 we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bottomland and pasture . And I knew your agony with Christy in my woods , heard it and took the gift of birds you threw me , Christy 's yoke and your yoke and my yoke , and dissolvedthem in my substance. 0 when I rolled over onto the world in my agony and thought , lost in Charity , that I might never find my way back home to the bottomlands , I slept by you ; and in my agony I was reaching out to touch the world and I touched you when I touched the world , I touched myself that I had put in you . Reach , spread , roll out onto the world and touch , 0 Boy ! 0 River ! When Christy and I looked at the map and saw all the life of the shaped countries , our minds were blown globes like the world and within the worlds of our minds there was created , mapped and carried there our idea of World and of History , although we were of little Charity ; and our hearts , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic and lieder of blood : p 32through the corridors of our veins , singing like troubadoursand minnesingers and bards Iliads and Eddas , Odysseys and Geneses , and breaking echoes of history and time and the rabbled glory of men and life through ages in the spaces of our minds ' universe  --  and creating everything again . And hearing the blinded girl 's song of the world in the hallway , I melted into the world and changed into everything , entered into everything that had ever been created or constructed , buildings , woods , rivers , pomp , love , history ; and everything entered into me , all involved in all . You , River , then , held like a capsule of sperm the whole seed of creation ; and the house we came from , breath breathed into it , like one uttered breath all the speech and all the life of men in a world of worlds . But even a river , River , can fall to ruin ( you lie so thin and weak and old ) . In time , important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to move ; and in time the bottomlands where , it seemed , Nigras and Charity gatherers were gathered so often , like a flight of summer flies that have vanished , were cleaned smooth as desert of palmettos and muscadines , and oilwells stood up over broken yellow swords , and you were turned out of your path as though you had forgotten all the ways you had ever gone and moved farther over into Riverside , white Fuller'sEarth Mill on one side , gasping the white fogged breath ; and on the other the black towers of riggingsp 33and the scraped and bald desert of yellowgreen or black slag , ugly subterranean rocks and the thick mudflats and slues like the slime of decomposition . But across the icebound bottomlands , over the sleeted slues and the rime of the bog , with beak of horn and horned nails , chiming his terrible Midnight , stalks the bird whose ghost you are , 0 river 0 my waters . It seems , Charity , that the young ones were always packing their suitcases to come back to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waiting , taking the young ones back and keeping them as long as they could  --  they at their standoffish distance of never belongingthere or anywhere that broke the old ones ' hearts who never said a brokenhearted word  --  till they had to stand on the front porch again and watch them , the Folners and the Berrybens and the Sue Emmas and the Boys , going through the gate to the Highway with their suitcase in their hands  --  away again , who knew where . There was just no future in a little town like you for young people young and ready , they said . But the old ones sat right there with you , Charity , holding your dying hand , rocking and wailing and listening or countingtheir secret futile beads of hope. p 34YET what were the ways and roads that led me back , I whose ancestors were wheel and well and cellar and loft ? Day after day , night after night a ship plowed and plunged through the water  --  and we two were on its bow , standing together looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mine and telling , the way he told me long ago in the woods , in his way , of his life that became mine ( now I see it ) , of the roads he followed away , and of the ways back home ( " Blues " he called me instead of Christy because he said I was so sad . I had left home in you , Charity , with Clatzco Skiles , for the Merchant Marines , we had signed up at the Posto f ce , and gone away through Texis lyin in cotton , for it was pickin time , and the pickers , draggintheir long limp bags behind em across the fields , were like a pack of crawlin wounded animals with broken backs . I passed through Tennysee with niggers ' laughter over Memphis , niggers on the steps of houses in the September heat ; crossed over the catfish rivers. p 35A fall wind was already blowin in Ohio . I spit in the Beautiful Ohio for luck and good-bye . In New York I took my ship bound for Panymaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map , but they putt Clatzco on a freighter goin I do n't know where . In the ship I was lonesome and afraid , but I did my work . At night I 'd lay in my bunk and think of everthing . And then I saw a face , fair in its youngman 's bearded beauty , and so much like Follie that I almost cried out " Follie ! " I watched this face while I worked and it swam before me in my nights in my bunk . I wanted to putt my hand on this hand and hold it still under mine , made still by his made still . Oh he was bright and I was dark and I gave him all my darkness on that ship ; but we joined , for all good things in the world , and to find somethin together ; and loved , I never knew I could do it and was afraid ; and on the bow of the ship that night that he said , " What have we done Christy ? " I said , wonderin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know somethin good will come of this ... " Only sorrow came ) . Day after day , night after night , our ship plowed through the water filled with flying fishes and dolphins and the nights so blue and white , the spray flying up like feathers of white birds , and white birds following us . Some nights the water was so smooth , so quiet , and we were so quiet upon it , that the ship glided like a phantomskater ; and the moonlight would lie in the wide gleaming swath following as though the ship turnedp 36up , like a plow , moonlight . Life was in a stunning balance , timeless and directionless , and identities and names were lost . And then some watercurse fell upon us and our names were broken by the brute prow of the ship , like the waves that were broken , and we were anonymous as broken pieces that never can be mended to their whole again . This craft called Ship , this monstrousartifact of builders , held us , broken pieces , within it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the disenchantment came and the voyage ended and the others turned their backs upon the enchantmentas though it had been only joke played upon them , or dream , or charade , we , nameless pieces , pieced ourselves together into each other and went away , off the ship , into a world of magic and witchcraft whirling in the twilight glimmer of hope and hopelessness . Who were we and where had we ever come from , what had made us what we were ? Charity and the house and all the people in it had been blown away , it seemed , by my breath . Looking , as we went , toward the water that held beyondus the ship it had spawned , phantom water-egg that had borne us , we stopped ; we heard the fogbell forlornlyclanging . It had a broken sound that seemed to tell us dread , terror , loss , but some destiny . Waterborn , Glaucus and magician grass , we felt land alien . At night , in the cities , as we went , the wind was flogginga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dust fell over the cities . The moon would hang fat in the East . And looking upon it , we wished wep 37could find one word , one strong word , small but hard as a stone , that would mean our aloneness in the world , and say it in great crying voice , hurling toward the moon . On the lighted boulevards there was marching pomp and ceremony and the rattle of laughter , revel and carousal and a running . There was no name for anyoneor anything . The lonely were waiting on the corners and in most every park for someone to come  --  and they could bruise themselves against each other into at least a momentary reality upon a bed of peace . ( But if I were to speak of the loneliness within love , would anyone understand ? ) In the cities certainty was deranged and a crack and a break were in the once clear voice , a flaw in every finely woven garment . Some daemon purpose was sown all in the land . ( The only caress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a marble caress . 0 granite caress . 0 granite kiss . ) And in the desert , where we were , the bare scalp of earth stretched scabrous and feverish under the metallic light , and the wind would run its lion-toothed comb through the loose sand and sage , rend them like loose hair and scale and fling and scatter them over roof and against us going bitten and stung under the hard tile sky . Hordes of grasshoppers would ride in on the wind and shuttle together , clacking their desiccate wings . There was a steaming vapor out over the tortured desert and the light went hard and percussive so that it might ring like a copper bell if it could be struck , and the world lay brittle as bone . We felt all of bone and rockp 38and metal , we could no longer melt together but stood apart hard as bone and rock . What ruined us ? We yearned for water . Then , in a little town by water , at the Equinox , we broke ourselves against each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the waters , what was crying over the waters , what was running all through the waters , ringingthe buoys over all the waters ? Shadows on the shore , what shadow-people , worn faces like stone metopes , shadow family , shadow kin , hovering together along the shore , near me , always near me . Walking walking walking round in one 's loneliness , up and down in a town . It is cold and the wind blows ; the streets are dirty . Because of much rain the trees are green-slimed ; the slime is bright and frozen in the streetlights . Yet the beast will not come into the fold . The ultimate agony of aloneness is not to be real ; and , unreal , to demoralize love . The grinding of my feet over ice on the city pavementswas over everything frozen , yet when I walked on the pavements something in some others I passed turned a little and bowed to something in me turning ; and we greeted each other secretly by a secret turning  --  but passed on . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white face , lined and drawn like a dead man 's .... Who would turn to a dead man ? Savior , Savior , hear my humble cry ; while on others thou art calling , do not pass me by ! ( I would set in the bus stations wantin to talk to somebody , but could n't , p 39would n't . . . . I would set and , hearin the wheels of the busses crushin the ice on the pavements , goin off to home for people in them , remember the snow and sleet in the bottomlands and the feet of the birds on the icebound bottomlands . And think of in Loosiana when we went there , Mama and Malley and Lauralee and me , when Papa was workin for the rayroad and travelin out of headquarters in Shrevesport ; and how we hobbled along like cripples over the first snow in our lives , and fell down on the hard ice , alone in Shrevesport , and cryin , and homesick . And how the only thing we knew to do on Sundays was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back for a nickel . In school there I had my first music and all the songs we sang were sad : " My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean " . . . ) and think that some of us are preparations for others : that we prepare others for their life  --  and that that ought to be enough . But the wound is left . How we work on each other like chemicals , like acids and salts and sulphurs ; how like lacquer we change surfaces . . . Everything , then , working with and upon everything  --  with accompanying resistance and damage and error but turning out somethingchanged , finished , prepared to receive something more , to take in and take on something more : pain , wisdom , love . This great , mysterious chemistry going on  --  praise it . When the betrayal comes , in the season of disenchantment , my agony goes formless and flies through the world , is only felt like wind and can not be caught into any images or shaped into any meaning , but hoversp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and lulls me into a spelllikedream . What muss I do ? Then I feel I may never hold or shape a hope again . I forget everything  --  and I am demoralized and abuse those who love me and go from street to street , betrayed , wandering , drenched in rain . Who am I , bruised so unreal ?  --  what will realize me ?  --  I whirl round and bobble or stand like a statue thrown into the sticker-burrs . And then I hear the voices ( " Come home , the light 's on , come on home , Ben Berryben ... " ) ( " Swimma-a-a-a ! Swimma-a-a-a ! come in ' fore dark . . . " ) ( " Rescue the Perishing . . . " ) ( " Boy , Boy come out to the woodshed , I 've got somethin to show you , by gum . . . " ) ( " Draw me , draw me , I will follow " ) and I melt down like the gingerbread man that ran and ran and ran and melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my memory every beautiful and loved image and idea I have ever had , and praise them over and over , saying , Granny Ganchion , I touch you and name you ; Folner , I touch you and name you ; Aunty , Malley , Swimma , Christy , I touch you and name you and claim you all . It is like a procession through the rooms of this house , saying , now this is the hall and there is the bottled ship and the seashell , this is the breezeway , there is the well , here is the map in the kitchen and here is the watery mirror in which , behold , is my face , me , my face . . . That people could come into the world in a place they could not at first even name and had never known before ; and that out of a nameless and unknown placep 41they could grow and move around in it until its name they knew and called with love , and call it HOME , and put roots there and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would sing homesick songs about it and write poems of yearning for it , like a lover ; remembering the grouping of old trees , the fall of slopes and hills , the lay of fields and the running of rivers ; of animals there , and of objects lived with ; of faces , and names , all of love and belonging , and forever be returning to it or leaving it again ! Out of this suffering a vision of violence : of striking beaks of horn ; of blood upon my thigh ; of fallen and falling birds . Fallen wings of leaves ( what silent terrible flock rows over across the heavens , dropping lost wings , blood-green and yellow , lined like the palms of phantomhands , upon us ? ) drift down upon us . So it all ends , in wordlessness , and in my tears . Yet something forms within the world of a tear , shaped by the world that caused it ; something takes shape within this uttered breath that builds an image of breath : p 44wheel of the windmill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel is like an enormous metal flower blighted by rust . Bend down to touch the fallen petals and , bending , hear the grinding groan of the wheel that begins to turn again in your brain of childhood , rasping the overtone of loneliness and moaning the undertone of wonder . Remember how it rose up on long legs out of the round , deep , lidded stock tub , and remember once when the lid was left off how the child of a Negro washwoman ( recall her poking , head wrapped in a scrap of red bandanna , the steaming black iron pot full of Starnes and Ganchion clothes ) climbed up and fell into the tub and was drowned and how the cows come to drink bellowed to find its corpse . Now the wheel lies in a grotesque ruin by the rusted and empty tub , and weed grows up between its metal petals ( and sunflowers , crooking over after the sun , mock because they turn ) and rats scuttle over the wreckage . It lies like the emblazonment of a fallen house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intaglioscarved in by decay ; and , vanquished and defiled like the coat of arms of Starnes and Ganchion , it lies unturnedby the wind that brushes against it but can not turn it , useless and disempowered . ( Once its turning was like a silver burning in the autumn sunlight , flashingand turning in its gyre so that wind in it meant water and families lived by wind , as a sailed ship . And if the wind came from the direction of the sawmill it bore and scattered over the house the piney pollen of sawdust ; and if from the direction of the river bottom-p 45lands , the scents of pines glistening far from the hot inferno of kilns , and the sweet breath of the Charity Riverwoods . Often I stood , boy blown in the wind that blew upon the cisternwheel and turned it , in an autumn dusk , a big hand holding mine , and watched the whirling of the wheel . I felt myself a steady fixed point on the earth round which a whirling gathered and spun as a center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to belong to no one ( he holding my hand ) and suddenly beholding the russet light of the turning sumach tree in the pasture ( pulled down and stolen from all light by that terriblewinter 's long ropes of solid ice ) , I thought , 0 I am leaf and I am wind and I am light . Something in the world links faces and leaves and rivers and woods and wind together and makes of them a string of medallionswith all our faces on them , worn forever round our necks , kin . Dare you go into the house ? Go , entering through the back door ( out of which you used to throw the water from the washstand to the chickens gathered waiting for it . Oh the mournful mewling of Aunty 's young broilers waiting at the steps for you in the mornings or at dusks when you would wash at the washstand : they haunt you , the calls of the broilers , their plaints and plaintive whines in the yard ) which opens on the screened-in breezeway . There seems some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking your hand to lead you . On this breezeway in the summer afternoons she heldp 46the flyswatter like a scepter and Uncle Jimbob sat , poorly and silent , on a little barrel , and all of them , the Cousins and Aunts and Uncles and other kin , just sitting there with nothing to do , nowhere to go , nothing to dress up for , just sitting . And then , hearing wheels on the road and running to the kitchen window , she shouted " The gypsies ! " , and all of them gathered at the windows , watching the bright gypsies jingle down the road , bright and quick and going someplace , and none of them saying a word , all of them gathered at the windows , looking through the windows . Her drinking well was right in the house at the end of the long back porch next to the indoor privy ( there was a crooked one outside beyond the chickens , but in it were hornets ) . This was the only magic thing , the dark , enchanted well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . When you cried down , " Hello ! hello ! " , it answered back only , " O ! . . . O ! " , in a wailing young girl 's voice . When Uncle Jimbob had to clean the well he would draw out all the water and lower you down into the darkness on a little wooden sling of a seat . You dreamt of it , and of ten  --  f orever  --  ( f or you had been so bred as a well-creature , brother to the bucket , lowered empty and pulled up full and brimming clear to be drunk down by waiting thirst  --  child of wheel and cistern-child , with gift of turning ) felt the terrible descent of alienation from face and voice and light into empty , lightless loneliness ( but 0 Granny Ganchion , joined to you , below ) ; and knew , that once you were pulled up ( by whom , p 47what hand ? ) into light and warmth again , you would somewhere in you be changed by the well-terror and committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as vision , for all their sakes . For each time you ascended  --  by hard will , by choice , by courage , you had a responsibility to the vision of descent . Down on the cold sand floor of the well you crouched , cold and trembling , and heard the mysterious voices beyond the well ( as you heard them from your pallet often , whisperingin the next room ) talking in an easy summer afternoon : Aunty 's and Malley 's and Granny 's and Swimrna 's and the others ' , and wondered , alien there , if you would ever be joined to them again  --  or if you were , whether you could ever really tell them what your terror in the well had been ; or heard the voices round the blue hole far above , voices of the gathered faces round the rim calling down " Boy ! Boy ! Can you hear your name ? " ( The wheel is broken at the cistern , the rope at the well is raveled and rotten , the bucket is rusted and leaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . ) And in the front yard in the late summer afternoons when the children played barefoot upon the stickerburrs , all her kin sat rocking round her on the porch and she spat snuff into the front yard and rocked and said , " This is an old house . That was pore Mama and Papa 's room there . I remember pore Mama and Papa sleeping in that front room where Malley and Walter Warren and Jessy and Berryben live now when all of us was children . " p 48And the children in the front yard running barefootedover the stickerburrs , singing " Go in and out the windows , go in and out the windows , go in and out the windows , for we have gained this day . " Or , in the game of Statue , all the Starnes and Ganchionyoung thrown into frozen poses , bent-over mourningshapes or vain or heroic arabesques  --  so that in memorythey seem like a pavilion of ruined statuaries . ( Folnereven then would cheat a pose into some careless , blase stance , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by in front of the house and stop all rocking and any game and where , where was it going ? And who was the wild-faced man in the dirty cap who waved the gloved-black hand from the engine as it passed ? And what was he trying to say to all of them , to the children playing games in the big front yard round the speckled canna and the big ones rocking on the long gallery in the swing and wicker rockers ? Here they sat and ran as he passed , and oh who was he , this leering , magical , terrible man who waved the great gloved-black hand at them from the little engine as it passed , going where ? coming from where ? Oh they said it was going to Riverside , but that train was going everywhere . " And oh , " Aunty said , " we ai n't got a chance , we ai n't got a chance in this world .

Pore Maidie , she cries ever night for Charity and all of us in this house , and I wish she could come back , the city 's no place for Maidie , no place for pore pineywoods folks , Maidie 's no city girl , never was farther than White Rock Bridge on Fourth of July picnics before she went to Dallas . She do n't even know her neighbors , they work all day , and on Sunday she takes the children to Sunday School and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back . Some-p 53times she goes to town to Kress a little , but that 's about all . The time they made me come to Dallas to see the dentist was awful , firewagons bowfin their sheens ever minute , those streetcars grindin day and night , just could n't stand it . This town 's burnin down and they 're all killin each other , I cai n't sleep or set still and I 'm goin back home , ' I said ; and declared I uz comin back to Charity . Said I 'd order my teeth from Sears ( certainly would n't have Doctor Stokes in Charity to make my teeth , that drunkard ; he 's ruined ever mouth in Charity ) . " But pore little Maidie in that duplex in that city ; I wish she 'd come back here . Wish all of em would come on back here and we could have our reunions that we used to have when all the Starnes ud come in from the woods . Never saw so much squash and yella-legged chicken in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and the pretty , timid girls  --  where have they all gone ? I tell you the Devil walked in the riverbottoms  --  andcussed this town . " I just want to set right here in this house , do n't want to see nobody , do n't care if they all never come here again , just want to set here in this old rotten house until I die . Never had nothin , never will have nothin , none of us ever had a chance and I do n't care any more , be glad when I die , wish I 'd hurry up , then it 'll be all over with . " Oh you ai n't got a chance , you ai n't got a chance in this world . You are down in the back and got hemorrhoidsand a stone in your bladder and you ca n't car-p 54penter or work at the roundhouse and the garden 's dry and burnin up in the burnin sun and you ca n't buy feed for the cows and chickens and I do n't know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rock and spit and die one day and be buried by your poor relations . And the infernal little town dead and rottin away and all of you poor as niggers and your teeth bad and your sides hurtin day and night and no money to see a doctor in Dallas . " ( And Jimbob , Jimbob , the pigs is in the peapatch but do n't run , walk , Jimbob . Mind your back , Jimbob . My Lord guess we 'll all die in a pile right here with the pigs in the peapatch and nobody carin . ) " Nobody carin . Now a spider lives unbothered in the doormat that never knows a pawing foot upon it . There is the kitchen gathered around the great worn woodstove . A faded map is still tacked on the wall . You hear the mice kicking in the turned-over oatmeal . And you hear the wind that lopes like a spectral rider round and round the house , whirls down the flues and chutes into the woodstove and thrashes the ashes and blows a wild little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a melody from a farther room and it is the wind blowing a tune in the closed shutter in the room where Malley Ganchion lived on like a mouse in the house after all the others had gone , hoping some redemption for them all would come . Some appetite waits and lurks in the world , you re-p 55mark ; it is some great hunger , insect and rodent and decay hunger . This seems suddenly to be a law of the universe . Insect , mold , rat , rust , death  --  all wait for and get the human plunder in the end , to carry the carrion away . The vultures of this greed hover and plane over us all our lives , waiting to drop down . The leaf has its caterpillar , the stalk mildew and the worm lies crooked in the bud . And observe the little white lice , dandruff in the golden head of the marigold , the gall chancres and fistulas on the rosebush . See the shale of fly carcassesin the spiderwebs , of caught hornets and flying ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this house lie fastened in what web , stretched over what blue Kingdom ? ) , bits of wings and antennae , all debris . The dirtdobbers ' knobs of mud , lathed round and whorled smooth , hang like many lightless lanterns  --  because there is no hand to knock them down . The insects have taken over  --  we fight them back all our lives , but in the end they come victoriously in , our inheritors . Look in the corners , under things  --  find the little purewhite puffs and tents in which some whiskery thing lives , find the thousandlegs and stinkbugs and doodlebugs and Junebugs , find fantastic bugs with shielded backs and delicate marks and brilliant colors and designs . See a caught mouse in a trap  --  set by what futile , mocked hand ?  --  rotted to a frail skull and a vertebra . And see over the boards of the faded floor the Sienese lines of tracks and roads and tunnels and cross-hatched marks and trails . In the bins and cannisters are weevils ; the roaches , unmolested , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . This is the slow eating away  --  mold and canker and mildew and must , gall and parasite , lice and little speckled ticks and grooved worms . In a corner of the pantry ( where you often ran to hide from old Mr. Hare , passing in his rumbling wagon calling " paa-ahs ! paa-ahs ! " ) discover a ruined still life of left vegetables , whiskered and leprosied , and rotted fruit spotted with pustules and the stippled fuzz of fungus . ( You remember the glassy picture in the dining room , where you ate on Sundays , that was of a sad dead blue duck dangling down a golden-flecked and purple-speckledhead  --  with staring eyes that watched you eat  --  and pears and peaches round him ; and feel that picture 's ruin before you . ) And all so quiet is this eating away , except for the wind that winds a mummy cloth around the fallen splendid house delivered to its inheritors . So this is why when often as you came home to it , down the road in a mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on the most fragile web of breath and you had blown it . Then you thought it might not exist at all as built by carpenters ' hands , nor had ever ; and that it was only an idea of breath breathed out by you who , with that same breath that had blown it , could blow it all away. p 57Led by this hand you go to the well , made of stone and minaretted by a slender windlass where the rusty and battered bucket hangs like a ruined bell on a rotted and raveled rope in its tower . If I should cry down some name in this well , you think , what voice would rouse and speak out of this well to me ? You cry down the name of Sue Emma Starnes , calling " Swimma-a-a ! Swimma-a-a-a ! " ( come in ' fore dark ) and you hear the round wavering answer , like a voice heard under water , " And all the daughters of musick shall be brought low ... " And then the long story , told out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing in the wind : " Well , when Swimma finished Charity High , " the well-voice says , " she stayed around home for awhile but then got restless and packed her suitcase and went to Dallas to stay with Maidie , her sister , you know . Right away that girl blossomed out in Dallas , it was just her style. p 58 " Got her a job in J. C. Pennys sellin paints and hatchetsand hardware things , but soon they learned that Swimma Starnes did n't belong back with the hardware . She had talent at fixin and arrangin and when they saw that she was right smart at decoratin they put her in the windows , gave her the job of sprucin up the showwindows . Naturally Swimma loved to be in a showwindow , do n't you just know ? It was the Ganchion in her . " Then because she had a real cute shape , built like a carnival kewpie doll , she got this job modelin at NeimanMarcuses . This really changed Swimma , let me tell you . Got to smokin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wear her black hair ( she 's part Indian , you know ) piled up on her head one day like a African and flowin all down her back the next like a huzzy . She moved right out of her sister Maidie 's duplexinto a suite at the Stoneleigh Manor , said Maidie was an old fogy and ought to move back to the sticks , meanin Charity , and made fun of the Sunshine Boys that practiced ever Wednesday night at the duplex . " You ought a go back home and hep Mama and Papa , ' Maidie said to her , and this made Swimma so mad she had one of her tantrums , shoutin , I 'm not goin back there , it 's a cinch . Why should I go back there , that 's where you belong . I 'm not goin to wash over a rickety ole washstand covered with oilcloth and ruin my complexion with lava soap and go out through the cold and rain to the privy when I can have Princess Pat Preparations and a pink ruffled boudoir in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoneleigh . ' p 59 " Now just a word of well-wisdom here . You rememberOla Peabody 's neck  --  how it was scaly like the bark of a tree ? The end of all beauty and swank is Ola 's neck , scaly and crusted and crinkled . Josh left Ola for a twenty-two-year-old girl . His marriage to Ola was as if he had abused her and deformed her for twenty-seven years and then throwed her on a trash pile . Look what marriage does to a woman . Look what it did to poor Ola  --  a big tumor is all she has ; and gray dry hair and a scaly neck . No childrun , she could never have any . While Josh has kept himself up good , with still good teeth , never went to a dentist in his life ( except once when he thought he had pyorrheah and we nearly had to bury him because he thought all his front teeth would turn black  --  and I wish they had )  --  and a figure so straight and no pot like middle-aged men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eula Pearl and is startin his youth all over again with her . These nasty men . Men are so nasty , hair all over ' em  --  did you ever see a man that would n't scratch where it itched , I do n't care where it is ? Nasty things , that 's all they think of . I want youth and beauty , ' Josh said . Why of course , so do all of us want youth and beauty , but how can Ola have youth and beauty after being bounced around , used like a drayhorse , after liftin and scrubbin and servin him like a servant ? Josh is a big Shrine , wears that tasseled cap often as he can , laughin and struttin and bitin a cigar . I wonder if those Shrines know what he 's done in his personal life ? Ola ought to write them a good letter about him and tell them all what he has p 60done . That 's what Miz Shively did . When she found out what was goin on between Brother Shively , preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widow , she just called a meetin of the Board on Tuesdayevenin and read before them a letter about what she had found out . That was the end of Brother Shively , he was transferred to Beaumont . " But the point is that the end of all beauty is Ola 's neck , scaly and crusted and crinkled like a work-glove . " Well , anyway , at a personality contest of some kind Swimma won it and was sent to New York in a airplaneto walk up and down in some long silk dress ithoutany bosom to it , jcs straps , mind you , and nekkid as a jay half-way down to her waist . She was judged a beauty everwhere and they was a flyin her all over the country like some prize heifer to show off , even to Hawayaand everplace . " Then she went on the stage ( just like Folner Ganchion , everbody could all see it )  --  that little county girl Swimma Starnes that everbody knew in Charity Texis  --  and made a mint a money I guess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazines ithoutcomin upon Swimma Starnes smokin a cigarette or cocked up on a wall like Humpty Dumpty with her long legs bare in a bathin suit no wider than a hair ribbon . Naturally she attracted the men like flies  --  that 's what she wanted . Like her ole grandma , had to have whiskers round her , had to have a pair of pants round her noon and night . Had more men friends than you could shake a stick at , got expensive presents flung atp 61her from all of them , I know on account of I was told . " She jes disinherited all her family . While she was prancin round half-nekkid in some personality show , her pore mother Lauralee Starnes was a brushin down dirtdobbers ' nests from a outhouse in Charity Texis with a hickrystick , or spittin snuff in a tincan on the front gallry . " Then Lauralee and Jimbob Starnes got word , jes on a postcard from Miami , Florida , that Swimma had married , had married some rich man ( we think he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Swimma started havin the little babies with big heads . First one was a boy with a head big as a watermelon and shaped like one . That little freak lived and lived , head kept gettin bigger and bigger , and they would cone and measure it and measure it , but it would n't die , really got strong and healthy as an ox , and jes lay there in its bed , huge and strong and an idiot , thrashin like a whale and slobberin all over the bedclothes . The wicked have their hell right here on earth , I said . Well , that thing lived to be nine years ole and no doctor in the country could do a thing for it ; until one mornin they found it dead in its bed and that uz a blessin . " Now Swimma will really come to her senses , we all thought ; it 's taken such a tragedy to shake some sense into her head . She grieved and grieved over that little monster , had a nervous breakdown and took to heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . We thought she would divorce that rich man that people said was some big Miami gambler . But nope , she stayedp 62on with him and what do you think ? She had another bigheaded freak . Another boy . But it lived only a year . You know there 've been a lot of freaks in Charity , that Lindalou Bell had a bigheaded baby like that and they said it uz because Simp Bell had lived round among the nigras out at Grapeland when he uz buildin the Highwaythrough there . Oh there was a row over that  --  Lindalou 's famly , the Bensons ( been in Charity for years and years ) blamed it on Simp 's old daddy , Dr. Bell , a perpetual drunkard and had insanity somewhere in iz famly ; and Simp 's famly said twuz Lindalou 's fault , that she was diseased and oh I do n't know what all , it was all terrible and one of the worse scandals of Charity , the two famlies literally fightin in the street and the whole town talkin  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little deformity that the Barkers had , turned out to be real talented , went away with a carnival as a frogboy last we heard ; and the Saxton boy , blown big as a balloon , could n't walk with him n the sidewalk , he was so stout ; and those little deaf-anddumbchildren of the Royces , flashin finger language , it was so sad to see them . And there 're a lot of other Charity freaks , too , in my estimation ( but they 'll all come home ; like the cows they 'll all come home )  --  Smollett Thompson ( let 's not mention him ) and the rest  --  leave them alone and they 'll all come home , late or soon . What got into this house ? What got into this town ? Houses and towns hold their tragedies and could tell some things if they could speak . You know how Christy Ganchion left with the Skiles boy for the Mer-p 63chant Marines . Somethin happened to Christy , somewhere , that nobody 'll ever know . Christy 's quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some said ( but I do n't believe it  --  still water runs deep ) , like Thrash Clegg , they say , but you cai n't make me believe it . Anyway when he come back they had a time with him for awhile . Then you know how he married Otey Bell from up in the woods beyond the mill and what all happened , but that 's another story , do n't ask me . But anyway  --  one at a time , I 'm speakin of Swimma Starnes , now  --  after this second freak of Swimma 's died she jes went straight to the dogs , they say . She got to be jes common trash . Her rich husband divorced her , then , after he had ruint her , but still she would n't come home . " Well , and then we heard that she had gone to New Orleens and played around and drunk around and married a little ole jockey . Seen his picture once and he 's as drawn up and spiney as Ole Man Nay and looks a hundredyears old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be that little , they say , so as to be light on a racin horse . He had a lotta money , too . Swimma had always said that she was goin to find a man with lots a money and get out of this town . She sure did , too . " And then they discovered oil over round Conroe , the Miracle City . Ole Jimbob Starnes ' father had owned some land around there , and who should pop up in Charity one bright day but Miss Swimma Starnes , grinninout of furs that haltered her like a horsecollar and practically dragged the ground , and on her head a wholep 64bluebird for a hat , tail ( as long as you know what ) and all . Her wicked life had clawed deep lines all over her face as though she had been fightin wilecats and her eyes were swollen and sick lookin . Because of arthritis ( from liquor poisonin , we heard ) she dragged one leg a little , but you could n't hardly notice it if you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the way over in New Orleens she smelled it . She was all sugar and cream , bringin as a present a seashell that had written on it PLAYGROUND OF THE WORLD  --  thas all she brought , ceptin herself ; and pore ole Lauralee , sick , sweepin the floors before her  --  until Swimma found out that the Starnes had n't paid taxes on that land for years  --  now how could they ? we knew that  --  and then you shoulda beard the Princess Swimma . " You ole fogies here in Charity do n't know what the world 's like beyond the riverbottoms , sit here and shrivel up and blow away in the wind ; and why n you get a chance to make a little money and rise above all this and get some security and a little ease you lei it slip through your fingers like sawdust , letting everything rot and go to pot and seed , I 'm ashamed of all of you , have n't got any more sense than a stick of stovewood , you make me tarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York or Loosiana or Florida accent , I do n't know , I cai n't do it right , but not like Charity talks . Oh she was a devil . " Well , she went back to New Orleens  --  that little ole banty come drivin up for her in a black sedan of some kind longer'n the Katy Locomotive and they went offp 65ballin the jack in a cloud of black Charity dust . Pore ole Lauralee . " Know where she is now ? Back in Texis far 's Borger , that clost but no farther ( that little banty jockey jes flew away , do n't know where or why , guess the last racinhorseSwimma saw him on jes kept goin ) . Runs a boardin house ( and a little of everthing else ) for oilmen , hope she 's satisfied , somebody that saw her said she 'll hear a dirty joke from any roughneck that comes in and sets down with one to tell , laughin loud and slappinher thigh and talkin about anything . Has a diamon ring big as a hensegg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad ) which she says is a beautyspot . . . . Lauralee still said till she died , pore ole thing , that Swimma 'd come back home to Charity , but she did n't . But this 's not all " When they buried Christy Ganchion , who should crop up for the funeral but Miss Perfecto . ( You know they had the services in the old house , not in the church , and the casket was so big ( he was a big man ) they had to putt it through the winda under the chinaberrytree . They putt him in 's old room , kept him there for three days with always a light on ; and walkin down the road past the house you could see through the chinaberry leaves and through the winda Christy lyin there in iz box in iz room quiet as ever . ) Only the young ones was left , Starnes and Ganchion  --  Maidie ( she was there with her two boys , grown men ) and Berryben ( not there , still away somewhere ) and Swimma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her Bell'sp 66Palsy , pore ole thing , best Christian in this world , what a life she 's had . Swimma seemed the same . Said she was still lookin for a good man ( she 'd run through I do n't know how many like a pig eatin acorns ) . Anyway , turns out that when Granny Ganchion died ( finely , after livin on and on and sayin , I ' 11 live to be a hunderd just to hound you all ' ; they had her goiter taken out , said twood bring back her hearin , and some said it did , that that 's what killed her , that towards the last she heard Christy , and that when she heard the whine of the planeing mill , dyin , she said , Listen , what 's that ? I knew it ; wherever I go , above or below , there 'll be a sawmill . ' They 'd had to lock the cellardoor after she got so feeble , to keep her from goin down to the rootcellar to find somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) she 'd left a little money in a fruitjar for Christy . There uz only Christy and Malley left now an Christy left Malley in the house with the Cleggs nex door to look after her ( they come over one day , to bo ry somethinno doubt , and found Malley dead in her chair by the opened shutter . Mice had made nests in the windasillout of the gray hair she 'd combed out as she set there day in and day out , and there uz even sparrows ' nests in the shutters and dirtdobber hives . Some said she 'd opened the shutter to call out to a wagon that uz passin by ; and others that she 'd seen somebody she knew comin acrost Bailey 's Pasture  --  we 'll never know . It 's all so sad , the life of this house , and seems like nothing but deaths , but then that 's the way anything ends , finally , ai n't it ? We all have to die . . . ) and went awayp 67to Houston , nobody knew what for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they saw him wanderin in the streets lookin like a dead man , and passed him by ; others said he was sellin newspapers on a corner , and still some more said he 'd joined a Mission . Anyway it turns out that Swimma was in Houston too and that she come to Christy on the street corner and got money from him often , sayin she uz sick and broke . No wonder she come to his funeral , they had this between them . I think this death nearly killed her , but you 'd never know it , she 'd never let on she was hurt by anything , never in her life . " She jes made a list of all the old dishes after the burial and left . Maidie said she only wanted the churn that Aunty her mother had churned in . " Somethin wild and cussed in that girl  --  but somethin else , too ; cai n't put your finger on it . She 'll come to a violent end , you watch . We 'll all hear of it one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddest thing I ever heard tell of . " Pore ole Lauralee Starnes . . . " And then the well-voice dies away and somewhere in the long grownover yard you think you hear Swimma 's husky girl 's voice , crying as she flung down cousins into statues among the stickerburrs. p 68 You cry down , " Hattie , Hattie , Hattie Clegg ! " and wait ; and then you hear a faraway watery voice that rises from deep below to the surface like a bubble , bubbling and warbling , " Ho-o-o-ome  --  ho-o-o-ome , " and breaks and says like a silvery crying : " Anybody home . . . ? " and echoes " Ho-o-o-ome . . . " It is the calling voice of Hattie Clegg who lived in the crumbling house beyond this house and used to come so often to see everybody in this house , always calling at the back door " Anybody home ... ? " before she went off to louston to work for the S.P. " Nobody is at home anymore anywhere in the world . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , " Hattie , Hattie , every home in the world is no home for you and me , we are meant to go from home to home and call if they are home ( and only strangers break out through some unconsidered door like a bird out of a clock and chime terror ) and leave again , for some other door . " p 69And then Hattie speaks out of the well to you .. . " After a bizniss course at Miz Cratty 's Select Bizniss College in Palestine , where I learned Gregg Shorthand and comtometer and typin , I came to the city , got this job with the rayroad , been here twenty-five years. " 0 my folks ! Never shoulda left Charity , I guess , but helped em there , ever paycheck I got , sent a tithe of it home to em , Mama and Papa and Willadean and Gilbertand Thrash .

" Willadean 0 Willadean , I nursed you like my very own when you was little , washed you in winter by the cookstove , wiped off smut from your little hands twenty times a day , washed you and fed you and played with you under the shadetree and swang you in the tireswing , shook down pussimons and called doodlebugs and picked goobers  --  anything you wanted . Carried you on my hip round the place , day in and day out , till I pulled my side loose , made me slouched like I am today .

I could see Willadean 's fate right there , did n't have to putt no penny in no machine to ask her fate . Well , I said to myself , Hattie you 're a Christian and like a mother to Willadean , raised her from the cradle , nursed her and washed her and fed herp 71and toted her like your very own , it 's up to you to get her home and do some talkin to her .

Miss Willadean was in her glory , I could see that ; prissin in and out like a priss-ike at the tables , switchin here and there , laughin and cuttin up with the rowdies and singin right with the nickelodeon as she waited on them , Ding Dong bells are ringin , but not for me . . . .

The wind is blowing out a long long tale in the shutter ... . p 77 Here you sat , MalleyGanchion , by this old blind window that was like the closed and drooping eye of this decrepit rainwashed house , listening to this sad little tune played by the east wind in the shutter . Pieces of a broken memory drifted by in your head . What was this little lament the wind blew and blows , dipping you ( and me ) deep down like a bucket into the well of an ancient memoried self ? You did everything to stop it , because look what you did to stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed newspapers , the Charity Clarion , and the thick cardboard pages with swatches of men 's suit material from Sears ' catalogue . But nothing stopped that tune in your window when the wind was in the East coming from the Charity River , whirling the cisternwheel and filling the well . You sat and listened and lamented . . . " Oh the Charity Riverbottoms where the wind that blows this tune like some mouth on a french harp is comin from ! There in the spring the dogwood used to blossom and blow , and the redbud and yella jessmine ; p 78and the katdids ' ud bleat like the beat of an old rusty heart , and the frogs make such a husky commotion . Oh the sweet breath of the woods  --  the baby-breath fern and the little woodsviolets and the daylilies ; and on Rob 's Hill risin up beyond the old river bridge there 'd be Fire on the Mountain blazin like the burnin bushes of Moses .

Instead of all this decoration of the woods , you know what 's there now , oilwells there now , thickern flies , all along there ; and all the treefrogs and whipperwills are flown away , caint live in an oil derrick no nature left , no wonder . . . . ) Nothin is like it used to be except the wind blown from the riverbottoms into my shutter to play a tune about what has gone . ( The bottomlands are bald and have sluices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell it here when the wind 's right . That stink puts all Charity in a spell , they walla in it , it smells money . Never the sweet fresh smell of the old riverbottoms . Is this the vile oil of joy , this green and 79yellow putrid scum over the ponds ? ) The world has sold away everthing that was beautiful and as the Lord put it here to be , human beins have changed everthing into money and show . Why , out by Tomball the land is littered with oilwell riggins , and day and night the chugchug-chugand the little flickrin oil flames wavin in the night like the red flags of the Devil staked out to say he owns this infernal land ; and nigras and pore people who used to have no more'n one Jersey cow and a few Plymathrockhens got colonial homes and stationwagons . Everthing that used to be in East Texis is ruined , there 's a terrible change in the world ; and I set here left behind in this old house by all my kin and by my dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my wanderin son Berryben who 's gone away through the world and will never come back to me . " That tune ! I try to keep my faith and Job is my example ; for I have been smitten with these cataracks on my eyes to test me , it seems , on this dungpile of East Texis . But oh I think the eye of Heaven 's got a catarack on it too , gettin blinder and blinder , blinkin and blinkin , closin on the world . Soon it 'll be like the dark of the moon , no light , no sight . 0 Lord wink me over Jordan . 0 the droopin lid of the sick eye of Heaven , like my own blighted eyes .

" What is this little tune the wind blows ? Listen ! There . . . It almost played a slow Fly in the Buttermilk , Lula , Lula ! ' but not quite , just enough to torment me . How we 'd dance that tune and clap our hands ! That 's a memry ! I had a waist neat and limber as a wrist  --  and good teeth . I 've got pictures that show it , to prove it to myself ; did n't always have this bag hangin down from my left side , this tumor big as Granny Ganchion 's goiter , this windgall , this big Devil 's snuff-box . " Sometimes when I was young , in the mornins , I would come to this very shuttered window and think that if I flung it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic world I had never known before , somewhere out beyond the Katy rayroad tracks and far across Bailey'sPasture where now thee are only cows eatin the bitterweeds . Then when I 'd make a wish and open the winda wide  --  there was only the wood-roofed little shantiesof Charity across the pasture and a string of sickgreensmoke windin out of the sawmill smokestack . And at night in the summertimes the half-shutter of a small moon in the roof of the Charity sky seemed like if it t was opened , something magic and bright might fly down out of Heaven through it and rescue us all . From what ? Poverty and grievin ? Oh I do n't know , now . . . . Sometimes when Walter Warren and I would bep 81sleepin here I would suddenly be wakened by a flood of light swimmin and tremblin upon my face and it would be the bright little moon passin over this house and over us in bed in it and over Bailey 's Pasture which it turned silver and white ( I see the moon and the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ) . And I would lie next door to Walter Warren feelin haunted and full of some nightmare , fearin for all of us  --  Lauraleeand her family , Granny Ganchion and all hers , all of us in this old house . " But Walter Warren would never save me from anything of fear or any nightmare . The world he gave me was cold ; and so I waited for you , Berryben , to grow up and make the world warm and save something for me . " Walter Warren would never let me swank . When I had my hair bobbed ( was one of the first of Charity to do it , sittin on a crate on the back screenporch ) , Esther Crow came over to do it and I was so excited , trembled and giggled and I screamed so and we all got so tickled ( somethin terrible happened ) and me screamin so , Oh ! oh ! oh ! ' , that it scaired little Berryben half to death and he cried , Mama ! Mama ! ' and thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pull her away from me to protect me and Walter Warren was mad and trembled too and went away to set on the front porch sayin I 'll be damned , Malley ' ; and little Berryben ran cryin out to the chickenyard . " Then Walter Warren would grumble about my long gloves I 'd wear at nights over my coldcreamed hands and arms to keep them white  --  for him , but hep 82never cared . But he cared enough to make me have Jessy , me in my condition that never should have had another child and she was born so hard and mangled and nearly killed me ; that 's why she died so young , becauseshe never should have been born . " That 's all right , ' I would say to Walter Warren , lyin with his back to me in the night , wait till Ben grows up , we 'll never have to depend on you for any-thing . ' " And I 'd lie there and hear the tune in the shutter and feel cold and alone and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next room , sleepin with his little sickly sister Jessy . " It was waitin and waitin , through these cold years . And then , when it was time , Berryben just turned and went away and I cai n't ever call him back . It was WalterWarren drove him away , that meanness in him ; called him a scoundrel once , always criticized him and fought with him at the supper table , made him vomit up all his supper , is why he was always so thin . " Here at this very winda little Berryben stood with me once and watched the tents and folks of a circus that had crept in one night to the pasture while we all slept  --  it was like some fairytale thing ; and I wanted to go but Walter Warren would n't , so Berryben and I and Folner went and we bought a red and yellow paper bird that whistled when the wind turned him on a stick . And again one morning when I opened this very windaI discovered the big flappin tent of those Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 83night and stayed and stayed until the fool preacher was bit and killed by the sting of a diamond rattler whose poison he swore to all Charity the Lord would antidote through prayer . Then the tent was moved away . I 'd lie and hear their shoutin songs and sit and watch the cripples come on their crutches and in wheelchairs to be healed  --  and some of them were , too ; threw away their crutches and walked away . That young Jempson boy did . " Walter Warren and I strolled and courted in that very pasture and walked the rayroad ties under the moon . " Now there are only cows in the bitterweeds . " The whole time of my life has been in this house in this town . Seems I have seen my whole world through this stereoscope of a winda . Often I sat sewin and darnin here in the summers , the summer sun slantin in and lyin on my hands and gleamin the needle ( and a little golden stair of golden dust archin up and out through the winda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched through this very winda the children playin out in the pasture across the Katy tracks , chasin and cryin in their games . Berryben flew a kite there in the March winds and the sight of that little thing holdin on hard to a flyin kite with all his might is a memry of him . Or watched the children walkin the rayroad ties or swingin in and out on the iron gate ; and singin in the yard , I measure my love to show you . ' And another time a wild black bull upon a cow in the pasture and the children screamin , in No-p 84vember . Once Berryben brought me in a rain-soaked and smeared doll 's head from the pasture that he had lost and searched for there , and I made a little rag and sawdust body for it , and there it sets on that sofa to this very day , next to the pilla from Hawaya that cousin Sewall who joined the Navy sent . " But when all my sorrow came I closed this shutter and 've never opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Katy tracks and the haunted pasture beyond  --  and I feel like I do n't want to ever lay eyes on it again through this winda . Sometimes the eastern sun tries to worm through the blinds and I almost want to open them ; but then I do n't and never will again . When Berryben went out that front gate I said , It 's only for a little while and he 'll be back , do n't grieve so , Malley Ganchion . ' " I watched him walk straight across the pasture on the path to town and played like he was only goin to the store for meat and chicken feed . So straight and quick , walkin across Bailey 's Pasture , he went , with his suitcase , goin to take a temporary job in Nackadoches , he said . Little Jessy waved at the fence and I waved from this winda . Walter Warren stayed out in the patch and would not look or say good-bye . He and I was all alone together with just little sickly Jessy . Lauralee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Lauralee had her teeth pulled ( but then she died suddenly there before they could ever come back ) and Swimma had gone to Dallas , too , and started her shameful life. p 85 " Then every day I 'd set and set by this winda watching for Berryben . It was fall and the leaves and the leaves were fallin and I thought the leaves must leave their tree when it is time , how sad to see them leave the mother tree . But they will come back , too , in their right time , I said . " All the winter I waited and watched ; and the spring come quick , the way it does here , and the dogwood trail was all white again and redbud abloom by the riverbottomsand the leaves came sure enough back but not Berryben . Of course I know that that Evella Sykes had gone to him but I did n't allow what I thought to anyone , even to Walter Warren , I kept what I thought to myself . She was older than him and had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of mother to him , I know , loved him and wanted to help him all she could . He never mentioned her to me in his letters . " Then years passed , and in one of these that passed Jessy fell so quickly sick and passed on so quickly with that one year . . . . Berryben wrote a letter sayin he could n't come , on account of his bein so far away and had obligations there . " And then word come to me that Evella Sykes had gone away from Ben and that that was all over . " So quick Walter Warren passed on , going as silent to his grave as he had always been here on the place , keeping some secret to himself that he would never tell . I never knew how sick he 'd been until they said he died of a cancer . p 86 " Then Maidie wanted me to come on to Dallas and live with them ; but they had trouble enough and I did n't want to live in a city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I 've stayed . Some of the Cleggs come over once in a while to see if I am all right . That good Hattie 's been gone for years , works in Houston but comes home once in a while ; and the young ones have scattered into trouble and scandal , and only the old Cleggs live there in that house that I declare to the Lord will fall right in on them one day . " Hope the wind do n't get in the flue , cai n't stand that sound . . . . There is twilight in this house . Ought n't to be so alone , goin to get me some boarders . " That tune ! Now it sounds like pore Jessy 's voice singin like she used to  --  ' Rescue the Perishing ' ( Rescue the perishing , care for the dying , Jesus is merciful , Jesus will save ... ) at our Mason piano in the living room that was ruined by the leak in the roof over it and the rain gave it such a clinkety tune ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Warren would fuss and fume and rant so when he caught him at it that finally the little thing made a keyboard out of a cardboardand hid out in the woodshed playin cardboard music that nobody could hear ) . Pitiful little runted Jessy , stunted by what curse of the Lord ? Just too frail to live through a life , just at nineteen death took her away ( to a better land I know ) ; but oh how she lay so coppercolored in that bed for days and days , moanin and moanin , somethin like this sound in the shutter now  --  and the day she died I heard the rumblin of ap 87wagon on the road and the mournful terrible call of old Mr. Hare through his nose : paa-ahs ! paa-ahs ! ' ; and while his call was still in my head Jessy breathed so hard and died away from all of us . It was her liver . ( The children would always run and hide when old Mr. Hare would pass callin . Old Mr. Hare will get you , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Jessy , Jessy , I put out all your pictures sometimes , get a mania for em . Take spells when I jest need to see you so . Sometimes it 's a baby picture of you ' th not a hair on your little head and a little golden locket hangin round your frail little neck . Sometimes it 's that one of you and Berryben standin together by the speckled yellow canna ; then the one of you in your pale girlhood jest at sixteen in your sateen blouze that I worked orange curlimakews in for you . You looked like a little elf , never was of this world , taken from the beginnin . Then I put em all away again , back in my goods box , back with all your little clothes and Sundayschoolthings , after I get my fill of em . Those little biddy softsoled shoes ! The print of your little feet was no bigger than a mockinbird 's . Many times I think you was the only good thing sent among us , so good and frail and gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've so little now , seems like I 'm nothin at all , useless and idle and old and blind , that I have to get out signs and tokens of all I 've been and done in my life to prove that once I'uz somethin more . Then I go to the watery mirror in the hall by the hat-tree and look at myself and see my droopin cataracted eyes and it ap-p 88pears my face is all meltin down , cryin down in tears and meltin away like Epaminondas ' butter . Oh my ! How we can come to so little from so much in this life , would n't believe it if you did n't have pictures to prove it . Oh the memry of the catbrush of you and Berryben against my legs as I stood at the kitchen woodstove that I will never feel again . . . . All of it seems like a dream , like a trance , a woman old and blind as me should n't be alone so long . Sometimes I get in a spell , there 's such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin on and on and on , till it seems I do n't know any time or place or anything and even the clocks go all wrong and seem to tell no time and I feel like a cork that bobbles and drifts in a pond . And I go through room and room and say to myself what muss I do ? but what muss I do ? ' and pass like a graveyard of memry all the signs of everbody gone and all the relics of you all , and I stand by the well and look down to see my face and want to cry into the well , Who are you , can you be Malley Ganchion , who are you ? ' and pass the watery mirror that quivers my dissolving face like a face seen in the well , shimmerin and runnin together to form Berryben 's , then Jessy 's , then Lauralee 's , then even Granny 's and Folner 's faces ; and even look out the kitchen winda for somebody to pass on the road and see only one lone black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See one buzzard , do n't see two , you 'll see someone you 're not expectin ' to . ) And then paa-ahs ! paa-ahs ! ' , comes the ancient wail of old hare-lipped Mr. Hare selling pears from his wagon . And finally I endp 89up at this winda and set and remember all over againand get everthing straight and get hold of myself again . " Now the wind is Jessy 's voice just as plain . Listen . " " Hello , Mama , I 've got a little talking to do , too . " I always knew I would n't last . Know how I knew I was sick ? Had that pain always down in my side but never told about it . And lots of times , at night , I 'd lie in my bed and see a sight ; and when they were burning brush over by the river it was a signal of some kind to me ; and most of all when I sang my hymns at the piano I knew I would n't last , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever you are . From this sad world He would take you apart ; Tenderly calling : Give me thy heart ! ' ) I was always hearing the soft whisper . When I would be hiding behind the pyrocanthus bush in a game some little ticking bug would be ticking in the bush and seemed to be telling a secret time for me . Or when I would be doing my homework by the woodstove in the kitchen I would hear the little bugle blowing in the woodstove , it was a call of a faroff land , calling me ( ' Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling , Calling to you and to me , Calling Oh sinner come home . Come home , come ho-o-ome ; Ye that are weary come ho-o-ome ... ' ) " There were so many signs . At night the sight of the three black hens sitting in the beantree when I would go out to the privy with a lantern was like three black angels waiting for me . And the knocking of the fieryeyedmoths at the window , staring at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirp 90terrible burning faces  --  it seemed they wanted me and not the light . " In church the women singing in the pews , the sad strained voices and the wailing screaming voices calling , Rescue the Perishing .

Chuck Adams , will your name be written there in the Book ? ' " And the congregation trembled and somebody shouted in the silence Hep him , Lord ! ' " We all wanted our names in the Book , prayed and worshiped and tithed and took communion to get our names written there . " My special flower was the little go-to-sleep flower and I loved it most of all . I knew where a bunch of them lived in our pasture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves and put them asleep . ( And at the Chatauqua I wore my red crepepaper dress that you made for me , Mama ; and Berryben , who was some kind of clown with a pointed cap , spurted- water from a fountain on me and my dress melted down . But he did n't mean to . And at the May Fete I was a flower and Berryben a King with a silver crown and a wand and silver stars on it made out of Dennison paper . When Berryben the King wove in and out all us flowers squatting low with heads bent over , he quietly touchedp 91all the flowers with his silver wand and all the flowers lifted up and bloomed . But when he touched me I was so excited and wanted to be so ready to bloom up  --  and his touch was like an angel touching me , so gentle  --  that I felt paralyzed for a minute and could n't bloom , and then fell to the ground ; and all the people laughed . ) " I loved all the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very air round the woodshed was stained and flushed golden by all the yellow roses .

If I 'd have lived , I 'd a had a wart on my nose , anyway , and it would a sprouted a bristle like all the Ganchion women have . ) I wanted to go to Heaven , to the city Foursquare and paved with gold that we sang about in church and that Brother Ramsey told us over and over again about ; to have my name in the Book , Mama . " Wire , briar , limberlockThree geese in a flock ; One flew eastAnd one flew westAnd one flew over the cuckoo 's nest . ' " You see how much I knew , Mama , that you never knew ?

So I was not scared . You know yourself , Mama , that I was born with a veil over my face , that I was stunted and stunned at birth and Miz Van and Pollyella Van had to hold me first in a tub of hot water and then a tub of cold to get my circulation running . You know that I was purple for three days and nights , that nobody ever thought I 'd live . " I played with the littler children out in the yard , hopscotch and Teacher on the front steps and Crack the Whip and Drop the Handkerchief ( and when I ran too hard I would wipe away some blood from my nose and I would go away to hold my blood in my hand and look at it and wonder what it meant ; but I never told ) ; and Jacks in the hall when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a broom . " How many hearses shall I have ? One two three f our five six .. " About Berryben , Mama . He always stood up for me and now I want to stand up for him . Let him go around or if he 's hiding , let him hide . He 's trying to dive down for something to bring up for us all to see and to save us by . I hope we can all bear to face it when he brings it up . He wants to touch us all for all our sakes , Mama , for all our sakes , where we can bloom , and burst us up open into light . Everything else wants to touch us and close us up and put us to sleep . " He was always so gentle , never hurt me once in our games , always gave up to me . If we both had a syrup biscuitI would eat mine quick and then say havers ' and 93get half of his . He would never fuss for this . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when and if they were asked for . That , I believe , is what he 's doing now ; finding some real good thing to give away one day when it is asked for or needed . " Once he built a little house out of croakersacks for me and my dolls and when me and my dolls were cozy inside our good house , Berryben set it on fire and I burned off some of my hair , but I did n't get mad , that was all right , it was because Berryben 's wagon was supposedto be a firewagon and needed a fire to put out and I understood . " And then we kept secrets ; and buried pretty little pieces of broken glass for treasure and never told anyonewhere they were hid . " We all wanted to bury him and save him back like a little buried treasure for ourselves always . But so many things came early to claim him away from us , for themselves . He had a special place to go , just as I had . But always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bad and ugly things crave you too ; and there is a battle on . Berryben is in some battle . " Oh I do n't mean to sound so smart , but you must understand that I have got some wisdom from this death . We were just lost here , Mama , where you sit by your closed window . We did n't know where to go , but we wanted to go away from Charity and the sawmill . The Church told me where to go and got me ready  --  for I was marked for death when I was born . Berrybenp 94chose some other place that we ca n't understand yet but will . " And I got this death , Papa 's got his , you got these cataracks and this lonesome grieving life , and Berryben has his hiding away and searching . But he 'll redeem us all , in the end .

" But we never had any life together , all of us , you and me and Berryben and daddy . Daddy was so alone , all to himself , and you would stand away from us at the window , looking away from us , grieving always for something out beyond the window and beyond us . And Berryben had his own world , we could never touch him or gather him to us . And I had my secret signs . We were all looking for something and I wonder what ? " Not long ago I dreamt I was home again in Charity with you all and that I went out by the cisternwheel and found no water there because the cisternwheel had fallen to the ground and the well had dried , and that it was the end of all our time and sorrow and sinning becausethe oilwells and evil had come to Charity in a time of great drought , drying up the river , and there were no more birds , only a great pest of grasshoppers that had flown into all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled with freaks and tarred running Negroes , and Charity hated Jews and Charity hated Yankees and Charity even hated Charity , and everybody good was gone . And that the sawmill hadp 95grown so big and so close to our house that all day the sawdust sifted down on our yard , in our house , choking us , like white Fuller 's Earth at Riverside . And that the oil money had bred swank and greed and false-facednessand we were all playing a game and deceiving ourselvesand deceiving and cheating others and would not look at our true selves because we did not have the courage to endure what we would find ; and that all things fell to pieces like the broken wheel . And that when I looked down by the broken wheel I saw the little leaves of my go-to-sleep flower and said softly Go to sleep . ' And the little leaf folded together . " But do n't grieve , poor blind and lonesome Mama . We have our Redeemer . " " Jessy , Jessy , you speak only a memry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I ca n't think straight , too old and blind and mixed up . I can only hear your voice like a wind in my shutter . But now  --  hear it ? The wind is singing in the shutter about Berryben , pore lost and sufferin Berryben . Oh Berryben Berryben I lighted the way leadin home a hundred times that winter you was over in Sour Lake , burnt the coaloil lamps late ; but you would never see any road that led back to Charity and this house . " But I ca n't come back to Charity , Mama , ' you wrote from Sour Lake . What is there in Charity for me ? Ca n't anybody do anything , go anywheres ? I got to keep moving , ca n't stop , ca n't settle , like a bee in a flower bed . ' p 96 " And then I had a letter from Saren saying you had moved on there . " But Charity 's as good a place as any on this earth , ' I said . Got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by White Rock and also goin to get a paper mill factory ; lots of nice young people , all askin about you , ought to see what a time they have . Come on home to Charity where your own blood is and settle down and make your way . ' " But you would never come , I could have preached to you till the world looked level but you would never never come ; kept movin and movin over Texis , blown like a tumbleweed  --  by what wind , what wind , Berryben ? And now , hearin this tune blown by the wind in the winda , I think of you next , my pore lost and sufferin little Berryben . What was there that made you different from us all ? A mother 's got the right to understand her own son even though the whole rest of the world do n't and cai n't . But you would never come close where I could really set down and ask you face to face what was it ? What was it made you different ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano or be anything that hounded and scaired you ? Was it your Granny Ganchion that put some Ganchion curse in your blood and set such an example for you ? If I could have just seen you , I could have read it in your face , whether you and Evella Sykes were in love and why she followed you round . But I swore I would never mention her name again to you or even say her name again to myself . " We could never hold you , none of us . You seemedp 97like a little scaired animal of some kind . Somethin somewhere had shaken you up , scaired you so that nobody could ever hold you still . You trembled . Was it Evella Sykes , or was it Charity or was it all of us you got ashamed of and ran away from  --  your own blood an bones ? " Come on home , it 's not too late , even after all these years . The light 's on . Have n't been home in Charity for years and years , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grave nor set a pot of geraniums on your daddy 's . I remember everthing you ever said to me , that the world is big and Charity so small and this house old and sleepy . I 've kept em all in my heart and ponderedthem , all the words you said . How it nearly killed me at first , really it did , I vow to you Berryben it nearly killed me , could n't even swallow water . Had to keep busy mornin to night workin and doin ; if ever I 'd a set down I 'd a burst out cryin . When there was no chores to be done , before I had my cataracks , I 'd embroidry . Embroidried twelve cup towels that winter you left , one right after another . " I knew you wanted somethin that we all did n't know about ; and you kept it secret from me and would never let me know . That you wanted to go out after somethin in the world  --  somethin that your father never found but maybe grieved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do it , Berryben ; I would have helped you if I could 've , Lord knows I would 've , would 've done anything . You were my hope , boy Ben , when you went away all my hope went with you . You were my onlyp 98chanct . You closed this winda on my world , and when the wind comes from the riverbottoms there 's the song of all this sorrow between you and me in the shutter ; the song of sorrow in the shutter 's the same as in my mind . You were my only chance . For what ? I 'm not sure , I cai n't say anymore , I 'm all confused and riled up inside , cai n't say ; but in you there seemed to be all my chance for everthing . But I could n't keep you ; any way I tried , I could n't keep you . When you went away I said I know it 's right that you go , would n't have you stay at all if you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , what will make you happy Ben , I wo n't keep you . But what I felt when I found out you were never comin back I can never tell you , just the whole insides of me gone and fallen to pieces . " Our life was so hard and so little , I knew you would make it big for us  --  sneaked money to you for your expressionlessons with that teacher that came in once a week from Huntsville  --  all this behind your daddy 's back to get you out of the sawdust , Berryben , to deliver you from the sawmill , to put you in a better world and away from the trash standin round in striped shirts and bigbilled caps on Saturday nights in front of Duke 's Drug Store with cigarettes hangin out of their mouths . " You were such a promise in the church . I thought you would give your life to the church and for the good of mankind . I still believe you uz called to be a preacher and Hattie Clegg does too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . " But what do I have ? Only the twilight of this oldp 99memry-house , and a chickensnake 's somewhere in the castorbeans stealin my few eggs , and settin by this shutteredwinda listenin to this tune playin out my memry by a wind from the ruined Charity Riverbottoms . " Berryben and Jessy , my two pore lost children , listen , listen to the wind 's tune . Your pore old daddy , Walter Warren Starnes , for a long time after both you left us he never slept well , slept hardly at all , set up quick in his bed at nights and could n't get his breath . Said he was chokin , said it was his heart ; but I know it was memry and worry over you had their hands at his throat and his heart . Parents ought n't to do that , I know , but how else can you do ? Then he 'd hear a noise in your rooms and say , Malley , there 's a sound a footstepscomin from Berryben 's room , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some commotion in Jessy 's room ' ; and he 'd take the shotgun and go creepin and a pointin it through every room , all through your room , Ben , and all through your room , Jessy ; and I would lie there , frozen , thinkin , what will he find , an excaped convick from the Pen at Huntsville or a rat or just the creakin floor , but never Berryben or Jessy . And there was never nothin in your rooms , never nothin at all but everthing standing left the way you left them , quiet and like you left them . I 'd lie there in my bed and want to die , and think  --  is this what parents have to come to , a creepin at night through room and room with a shotgun after the ghosts of their children who 've gone away and left them lonely and sleepless and chokin in the night ? 0 the memry of your daddy in his nightshirt creepinp 100through your deserted rooms with a shotgun in his hands ! " This house is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother have to set midst all the heartbreakinleftovers of the past ? Goin to rent out these rooms , goin to move to the City Hotel , or write to Cousin Lottie in Lovelady to come and stay with me . " The Lord hep us and bind us . " You used to write me not to think so much , Berryben ; but I must look back , pillar of salt or no . And that wind turns a slow and steady wheel through the waters of my memry as it blows this tune of sorrow in my shutter . 0 what 's the meanin of it all ? There must be some mcanin somewhere  --  it cai n't all be just this rabblement and helter-skelter . Somethin has to replace what 's lost in us , what 's grown and been harvested or withered , like crops  --  but what ? We are taken and held and shaken by so many things in life ; but in the end it is Memry that gets us  --  we are finally delivered into the bitter , clawin hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . We ought to see to it that we make good memry for ourselves , like a slow and perfect stitchin , as we go along , and embroidry a good and lovely memry out of all the thread we one day have to set , alone , and unravel , stitch by stitch . Now I see that every day I uz rnakin a memry and did n't know it . Oh wish I uz like old Aunt Mat Bell  --  she cai n't remember a thing , cai n't even remember her name  --  everthing that ever was , for her , is gone , wiped clean out of herp 101head . Molly Jim , ' she 'll say to her daughter , what 's my name , Molly Jim ? ' Seems like a blessed state . " But listen ! Listen  --  wind sounds just like Berryben talkin . . . " " Listen again , Mama , and I 'll try to tell you for the hundredth time what it was that made me go away . " " I 'm listenin , Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your face , Berryben . " " It 's because you do n't open the shutter , Mama , because you 'll never open the shutter . But let me tell you if I can . I really left so I could come back again . " " But it 'll be too late , then . Either I 'll be too blind to see your face or I 'll be dead and gone . " " It 's never too late to come back again , Mama . There was just something that called me away from the Sundayson the porch and the children in the yard , from the grieving and misery and bitterness of Aunty and Granny Ganchion , from the scrape and rusty screech of the cisternwheel . It called me when I sat in the black hen 's tree , when I stood in the fields , when I thumped on my cardboard piano in the woodshed . There seemed something more magnificent than the Charity loneliness . Somewhere there would be somebody to understand me  --  I could prove my blood  --  feel and find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dumb-show . But more : an unnameable call away from all the witheredquiet and dying old life and ways of this little world of Charity , hemmed in by a railroad track and a sawmill and a deserted meadow. p 102 " All I know is that there was a change in me and , discoveringthat change in me , I would do anything to keep it unchanged , I would not let it die in me . I had to keep listening , listening , listening to it , just as you listen to another thing in this shutter . The sawmill tried to drown it out , the cisternwheel tried to drown it out ; I had to save it , hear it ; so I went away . I do n't want to live if I ca n't hear that voice . When I was home you followed me round through the rooms saying , If you 'll just tell me what is wrong with you ! What is changing you , if you 'll just put me straight on it all , Ben ? ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break my heart and break your heart and you would catch my face in your hands as if you could hold me there forever , caught in your poor old hands , and weep and say , Ben Ben Berryben ' ; and then I knew that I could never never tell you what it was , only break your heart again and again . " I tricked you all to get away , but I could n't tell the truth about the things that claimed me . Because you always said these things were sins . I always had that terrible guilt before you , had to tell lies and lies  --  you really made me evil , you made me be just what you were afraid I 'd be . I served you all and let you all use me any way you wanted ; anything you wanted me to be I was . Took care of little Jessy day in day out . I never had any romance except because of what Folner and Christy and Swimma told me like a secret . ( Once when we sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Look ! ' and it was the bull upon Roma the cow in somep 103savage battle and when I said , The bull will kill Roma the cow ! ' Swimma laughed on the fence and leaned over and told me . Later she wrote a word on the chimney brick and could n't erase it , and I would see those letters written on the walls of the bedroom and on the ceiling , everywhere , smudged the way Swimma 's hand had smudged them . I never fully understood until we pumped in the swing , first me then Swimma , and then I suddenly knew the whole terrible secret . After that when Swimma would cry , Pump me ! pump me ! ' I would tremble . ) " Sometimes , because I am a failure in the world , I blame my failure on you all ; say that you got me so mixed up when I was young that I can never clear myselfup again inside ; or that you made me so false to myself that I am unreal and never can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a failure is that I gave myself away to everybody and so had none of myself left for myself  --  I mean the part of oneself that is the part he works with , held by himself to work with . " And yet I collaborated with you in making myself false  --  for I was so afraid of myself and what it wanted to do , and so ashamed of it . So you and I together stomped the life out of it , every day , mangling it like a beetle . " But suddenly something beyond all of us , greater than all of us , freed us from each other . We tore at our hearts because we were powerless against this thing that came in between us and wrenched us apart . This was loving somebody. p 104 " She came , gentle and sweet , bringing peace , at a time when I was the loneliest and most miserable boy in the world . She made all my secrets vanish into her . For she made me feel that everything I had kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined within a secret that was divulged to us by touching where we had never touched before , and by the honesty of passion where we had been dishonest before . After our honesty with each other , what more was there to hide ? We had told . Passionate love is a conspiracy to tell each other 's truth to each other  --  that I am like this and you are like that , and together , in a joining , we make a moment 's truth of what each is . Beyond the moment 's truth , though , lies the hour 's untruth , which keeps yearning to be bared into truth again . She broke my unreality against her reality like a pot dashed against a stone , and mended me with all the care in the world , it seemed . For her I betrayed you and for myself I betrayed her ; we melted into each other . I tricked you and left you ; and after I had left you , all your kin and all your world died away from you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of us were shattered from our whole , I roaming through the world with Evella , you sitting by the window trying to piece everything together again in a falling house . " That very meadow upon which you close your shutterwas a pasture of revelation , of trembling news for me . For it was enchanted , some grass of magic grew there , could it have been the bitterweed ? When the circus came , Folner and you and I went  --  just across the p| 105tracks , there it was : the lovely sparkling girls whirling in the air like stars . And the times I played there  --  all the things I found when I played there brought me secret news : once a curled transparent skin ; the evening primroses , hairy and firm , opening and closing at the touch of light or darkness ; the doll was lost there and later found , but found too late , trodden and mangled and broken by Roma the cow . After the circus left to go across the river and into the world , stealing Folner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went there and found sawdust all over the meadow ( and got sawdust in my shoes ) and all the secret signs left by the magic circus ; but the bitterweeds grew up through the sawdust , Mama . And Evella and I walked through the bitterweedson summer nights ( scattering the pollen and gathering it on our legs ) , I telling her about my hopes and she saying , I will follow you across the river and past Riverside . ' " What did we go after ? I ca n't tell you . ' What do you yearn after , here at the window ? Something marvelous , something magic , that makes all secrets vanish . " ( When the forlorn beast , the spotted heifer Roma , bellowed at dusk in the wet meadow , it was a mystic desire , a voluptuous fear , a call way into the future , beyond the meadow , beyond Charity , over the River and far beyond  --  the voice of Bailey 's Pasture . That wintertime , standing by the window , I worried about the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter was everywhere , in the eaves where icicles hung like daggers , in the naked trees and across the bare dead earth wherep 106life lay frozen and paralyzed . That wintertime , standing by the window and looking out upon the winter and behind me you , Mama , singing softly Pass me not , 0 gentle Savior , Hear my humble cry ' ; as you sewed something , rocking in a chair . The loneliness of standing looking out a window at winter upon a town , feeling afraid , like crying , while you , Mama , sat in this room sewing and singing . While on others Thou art calling , Do not pass me by . . And the poor spotted cow out there , frozen in the ditch , the way she bellowed and called out for them to help her , to break her out of the ice ( ' Mama , ' I said , they are coming with axes . Mama , ' I said , they will kill her , Roma the cow ; Mama , ' I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oh she cries , she cries so sadly ' ) . " The low pleading bellows of Roma came through the window on the winter wind and I felt sick with it all , the room , you , Mama , singing and sewing in that chair as if nothing were happening , the winter spread over everything outside , killing everything , the men ( Christy was the leader ) with the axe over the poor ugly cow Roma caught in the ice . ( Mama , ' I said , she is crying so loud , now , like the dog the time he was sick under the house . Mama ! ' I cried , they have hit her hard on the head with the axe , hard ! hard ! hard ! Mama  --  she is quiet , now ; Mama  --  she is not crying anymore . Mama . . . Roma the cow is dead .

I was in a beautiful spell . It was in an autumn and it was a turning round , through light and darkness , under suns and stars , in a fantasy land . The faces of days were disaster and passion . The luminous wind was binding the autumn to the glistening world , blowing it round through trees with a sound of the breaking sea , and the sun was driving summer away , weaving autumn into the world and turning a wheel in Evella and me , turningus towards and turning us away  --  all love is a turningon a spit , towards , through , and away from flame  --  and we were like sleepwalkers and Evella would turn to me and say , Who are you ? ' and I would murmur , I am you and you are me and we are some rabblement of soul .. " With Evella I could never see myself , only hold up a mirror for Evella to see herself ; thus I became unreal . Who has the courage to destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rolled away like a stone into an abyss . Now I had only myself to remake . I was alone and floating in the world ; and I was alien to Charity and felt I never could return to all those secrets  --  the passion of the Bull , Swimma 's news of trembling , Christy 's songs and stories and his scar , the blood of his killed creatures . . . . " The world is a window fogged by my own breathp 108through which I can not see the world because of my own breath upon the pane ; and until I wipe it away with this ragged sleeve , I shall not see what lies beyond the window ; nor you , Mama . We spend our youth breaking the enchantments of childhood ; it is the bitteresttime of all . Youth is the naked , disenchanted child , shivering without garment ; for the garments of childhood fall into ashes . " Of all the evils you taught and tried to teach me , the only evil is that we cut ourselves off from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a turbine ; or that when that force finds us we hold ourselves still , blind and deafen ourselves to it . The finding of that force , the awareness of it , quivering in us , trying to turn us so that we may generate , and the attempt to use it is to make oneself real . The substitution of any other force is a mechanical turning and is false ; is evil . " To belong to this force does not make me evil or a failure at all , it only gives me back to you , to all of you , Evella and all of you whom I have ever loved or who have ever loved me ; only restores me to you . " Oh it is a crooked path I follow , Mama , but a straight wisdom comes from it once in a while ; and once in a while a sure and beautiful joy comes from it and I will build my life on that wisdom and on that joy that comes once in a while . And give it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mend all that is ruined and broken.

" Mama open your eyes ; open the shutter , Mama . For surely one day I 'll come back to this house . And what will that terrible , terrible moment be like when the shutter will open slowly like the unfolding of a waking go-to-sleep flower and there is beheld before you the wide shining meadow of Bailey 's Pasture , yellowwith blooming sweetclover and spotted with a thousandtrembling bees  --  and through it on the old path will be coming me , wading as if I were wading in to a shore through shallows of the sea , home ; and with gifts in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you , blind from cataracts , will sit on there , never knowing that the shutter is open , with the tune playing on in your head ; blind for so long that suddenly when vision comes restored you go on blind and yearning and wailingfor the vision ?

" But Malley Ganchion you went on sitting there with the wind 's tune in your head and said , " Let me see your face , Ben ; I want to see your face ; I want to catch and hold it in my hands .

And when no answer came , you sat and said , " Oh I wait for somethin to come to me , just as I expectedp 110it when long ago I flung open this winda in the mornin upon Bailey 's Pasture ; and I guess it must be the peace of Death I am waitin for and was always waitin for , to come callin like old hare-lipped Mr. Hare from his rumblin wagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tired and left behind by all I gave everthingI ever had to , and I want to die and pass away from all this eternal task of memry and heartbreak and never remember , never remember again .

You did n't want to flicker around East Texas , you wanted to blaze in the world , to sparkle , to shine , to glisten in the great evil world . You wanted tinsel and tinfoil and spangle and Roman candle glamor , to be gaudy and bright as a plaster ruby and a dollar diamond . Was that right ? Of course not . Wrong ? What is wrong ? " Who has a choice , really ? " you said . All of it was wrong from the beginning , from the corrupted foetus , the poisoned womb , from the galled cradle ( endlessly rocking for you and me , for you and me ) .

When your corpse came back to Charity from San Antonio that deep and leaf-haunted autumn , Folner , p 115they embalmed it at Jim Thornton 's Funeral Establishment ( which was also a cleaning and pressing shop when nobody was dead ) . There was a gray hearse . All of us went to the Grace Methodist Church and the Starnes and the Ganchions filled up two pews . We sang " Beulah Land " ( You would have loved that .. . " for I am drinking from the fountain that never shall run dry ( praise God ! ) ; I 'm feasting on the manna of a bountiful supply . . . " ) . A few women kept fainting .

What voices were howling round in her head as she sat there , gazing at you in your cheap coffin ? ) Your brother Christy sat out in front of the church in the car , would not come in , sullen and wretched . As we marched by your coffin to look in at you for the last time , I saw your wasted doll-in-the-rain face and I thought I could hear you whisper to me , " Make it gay , Boy , make it bright , Boy !

( The Grace Methodist Church had started out underground . There had been only enough money to build a basement with , and for several years we went down steps into the Church , like a cellar , and had a meeting . In summer it was full of crickets ; and often , tired of the singing , we would go outside and sit on the steps and watch the summer toadfrogs leap after and lick in the crickets . But when old Mr. Ralph J. Sanderson , the owner of the sawmill and terror of Negroes , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and some colored glass windows and these were added as a memorial to him . ) There were about thirty rows of pews and the Starnes and Ganchions occupied two of them at the funeral . Charity came and filled the rest . On the raised platform in front under a bare arch were the folding chairs where the choir sat , and to the right of the chairs was the piano . Nina Dot Dooley was the pianist . ( She said it peeanist and always ended even the most austere anthem with rolling chords , finishingup on a very high and tinkling treble note with her little finger that was arched over with a dinner ringp 117displayed upon it . She had an orange , spotted face . ) In the center of the altar , which was only the barest hint of an altar , stood one spare crooked candle in a goldplatedholder : the cause of the schism in the church that finally broke the old and the new factions apart and caused Brother Hildebrandt to form the Church Foursquare and lead his followers with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Mrs. Shanks ( called Horseface by all the boys because she had black lips that peeled back off her two rows of large , square , roastingear teeth when she sang out ) ; Miss Pearl Selmers , the alto and the only alto in the church with a trained voice and therefore in every duet or quartet , singing sadly and so faintly you could scarcely hear her ; Mr. Bybee , the forced tenor , singing always eeeeeeeee with a quavering sound like a saw played ; and Mr. Chuck Addicks , the little old bass . ( Once the Ku Klux Klan interrupted the sermon on Sunday to come marching down the center aisle in their sheets , terrifying the congregation who did not know who among them they might be coming after  --  but they had come in only to make a demonstration in favor of the preacher , of whom they approved , and to give a donation , wrapped in a white handkerchief , to the church . One of the sheets moved unevenly with a hobble and people knew it was Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folding chairs , and with great austerity sang " For his eye is on the sparrow , and I know he watcheth me . . . " ( You were nop 118sparrow in that coffin , Folner ; you were a plumed and preened gorgeous bird , hatched in a borrowed nest , cuckolded , meant for some paradise garden . ) The sermon was a long and sad one . It told about all the family , about your young life in Charity and your work in the Church . ( Once you had stood , at ten , before the whole congregation and recited the books of the Bible first forwards , then backwards . You had been a bright boy . You had sinned . The Lord save your soul . ) I want to make a little speech upon the passing of this boy , the sermon said . We have lost a leaf from a beautiful old Charity tree ( a leaf ! a leaf ! ) . A bright star has fallen over Charity ( a star ! ) . We have lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great price ! ) , a toy of the world ( 0 Jack-in-the-Box ! ) . This is a piece of the lavish gay world brought back to Charity black earth , the bitterweed pollen of the bitterweed of the world cling to his limbs brought home to this hive . ( Green bee that gyres out of season over us , grown thus into what yield of bitterweed are we ? Pollen to what cilia ( spike in the horses ' throat , death in the fowls ' craw ) of what green bee of gall ? ) We are burying the brightness of the world . We are burying like a foul thing in the dirt this twisted freak , like Sue Emma 's two little monsters , little slobbering freaks with bloated watermelon heads . Sue Emma 's sins ( and every day they 'd come and measure and measure  --  their head was like Granny Ganchion 's vile goiter , round and swollen and strutted with purple veins big as a chicken 's in-p 119testines ) . 0 precious shard of the Old Mother Lode that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark cursed vein ? Songs went through my head , Folner , as I sat there , songs I had known where , when ? " 0 had I the wings of Noah 's dove , I 'd fly away to the one I love ... " " One day you goin come and call my name . . . " " My love went away on a long long train . . . " And the little verse , piping itself out in my brain , over and over . . . " It was just a little doll , dears , brought in from the fields and the rain ; its hair not the least bit curled , dears ; and its arm trodden off by the cows . And its face all melted away . . . " And the tale of the gingerbreadman who ran and ran and melted away as he ran . . . And the mournful little tune that a child could blow on a petunia ; and the words of the hymn " 0 Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices howled round in Granny Ganchion your mother 's head as she sat there gazing at you in your cheap pink coffin , " I loved gems and jewels and would almost steal to have a colored ring to glisten on my finger , just like a Gypsy . We are burying here the glassy part of me. 0 me . . . desire faileth ; it is the burden of the grasshoppers . There is a fountain filled with blood , drawn from Immanuel 's veins ; And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains . . . Sure we had nothing in Charitybut Beulah Land to hope for and wait for  --  but how could that help ? That was n't enough while we waited . The church cheated us , Brother Ramsey cheated us . Ip 120had to burrow down under it all like a quick mole to have any life . Do n't think I do n't know all this . Now there Follie , lay still , lay still . Remember when I could n't keep you quiet on a pallet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This is the last pallet , little Follie , a pallet for good . Lay still on it , child . ( There 's old Miz Van come to your funeral  --  she brought you the first present you ever got in this world  --  a pitcher of cold buttermilk the morning you were born . Fly in the buttermilk Lula Lula ... ) " What does he say , Brother Ramsey , in his talking , in his sermon ? He is condemning Follie to hellfire . The Lord bath hung this millstone upon my neck , and I know what for and I have never told . It is a lavalier of wickedness . It is the enormous rotten core of Adam 's Apple . But I have had my life in my time  --  some way ... " ( You knew lips , how they move to make their words ; and the grimaces of faces when you were yelled at were sometimes so grotesque that you dreamt of them , strained and veined and goggle-eyed  --  and in your dreams the faces were only making faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear only the voices in your head . All the world beyond you was hushed as though some turningof a great wheel was stopped beyond you ( but went on inside you ) , and there remained only the silence of working mouths on shifting faces  --  and there was only the babel of voices in your head. p 121When desire failed you , you had nothing left but the betrayal of desire ( the moth-eaten coronation robes of dethroned queens ) and a pair of ruby beads given you once by a dark alien youth who found you at a carnival and loved you and stayed to love you longer and again . You would steal away at night and run to him at the City Hotel and all the town knew . It was said that Christy was this stranger 's son but no one ever proved it , for Christy was black-headed and swarthy among the other towheads  --  but this could have been the Indian blood that was supposed to be in the Ganchion veins come out in him , you said . Your father was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose for lechery and by the time you were fourteen he had shot dead two Negroes for not keeping their place and calling him Cap'n . You had had a hand upon your thigh in the church choir that made you trill like a meadowlark , " Fling Wide the Gates ! " ; and once while singing " Hear The Soft Whisper " at communion when all the heads were bent , you received your first baptism of joy  --  and had been Joy 's sister ever since . ) And then , when the family started walking by your coffin , Folner , to look at your doll-in-the-rain face for the last time , Granny Ganchion flung herself into your coffin and tried to seize you to her , crying out in her carline voice , but you would not come up to her ; and they pulled her away . As we drove along ( what Charity was not in the processionwas standing watching us like a parade ) a stormp 122broke over us and scattered leaves . It was the first full devastation of Autumn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it while Brother Ramsey sprinkled rose petals . It seemed he was murmuring , " sawdust to sawdust , " and that surely what was falling was sawdust from the planingmill . All around the graveyard there was the ruin of Summer , Summer 's wreck and plunder . Weeds were rusty with seed and the zinnias were crumbling . And then all the members of the families fell upon each other , embracing and kissing and wailing and sharing their separate and secret tragedies ; and for a moment at the Charity Graveyard there was a reunion of blood and a membership of kin over your grave ( the odor of lilies and carnations gave me a sensuous , exotic elation that I was ashamed of ) . There was a kind of meekness and the relief felt in truce . Some took a flower from your grave and fought others to keep it  --  it was like a battle of fiends over a holy prize ; and Aunt Malley came up in a trance and said to Cousin Lottie , " What kin are we all to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wise and bitter and skeptic , did not fall to the graveyard trickery and stood off to herself , gazing at your grave . There seemed to be some misery over in the world . Some atonement , some ransom was paid for all of us , for all our Sins . Now , in due time and in right season , what resurrection of what spirit would assure us of the meaning of this death , Folner ? As we turned to go away and leave you in the grave-p 123yard , I looked back and discovered a tall and sorrowful stranger standing alone by a crepemyrtle tree . It seemed he wanted to say something to me , that he was beckoningto me . But we got in our cars and drove away and he turned and watched us as we went away . The next day there was a change in the whole world . There was a moon in the daytime like the pale , lashless lid of a drooping eye and it haunted the day . Then rain fell while the sun shone and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and away , as if bewildered ( they knew ) , one of the hens crowed and a whirlwind got caught in the beantree and rattled the dry pods . I went out among the castorbeans and sat and heard the sad rain , like a faint weeping , dripping on the leaves . Finally in the afternoon it seemed the whole earth died , dried up and faded and curled . Huge blood-green maple leaves drifted like lost wings in the wind . Hens moulted . Some amputation had happened in the world , some desperate surgery . The fantasy was finished ; somethingcrueler was beginning , hard and of agony . The winter was close and lay long and gray and leafless ahead . Something waited for me , now  --  a world of magic and witchcraft , the brute , haunted world of some nameless terrible beauty , whirling in the twilightglimmer of coming hope and hopelessness . ( Who has not seen the gizzard-like birthmark on the luminous temple of the moon ? ) Then as the day ended , in the terrifying sunset that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain fell golden in the distance and the goldenp 124rain fell over the sawmill , apotheosizing it , as if it had achieved some kind of victory . You 've been buried in Charity for a number of years , Follie , our Follie , and I am called back to the loft where your relics lie stored ; and I am here among them rummaging for some answer . It is hard to be in the world and bone of your bone . Cry me out a name , which like a spangle cast out to me , I may carry out of this loft with me . I come , bending low , into the loft . I had been here once before with Aunty to rummage for a picture of her mother , and when we found the picture it had one eye eaten out by some animal and looked hideous and staring and tormented . Then I went again and again , with a heavy feeling of sin . I was looking for something within myself that might flower out in this warm , secret light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of a paper Hallowe'enserpent that would unroll , splendid and quivering , when blown into ) like a paper flower dropped in a bowl of water . I felt the excitement  --  the first I can remember  --  of discovery , like the feeling I had when I crept into forbidden books . ( Eugenics was big and black and evil , hidden under the linens of the closet and there I first saw the picture of a woman with a window in her belly through which I could see a little , wound baby , all in a sac entwined by a mass of strings and cords . ) I trembled in the loft . Here in the loft , which is really your sepulchre , Fol-p 125ner , are many things of silence and dignity ; and it seems that in them lie all the hope , all the future , in the riot of insects and rodents which are feeding on this storage of antiques . There is a spinning wheel which spiders have mocked with glittering webs like doilies and lace valentines . There is an organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' feet sift over the strings with the faintest prism tinkle like the death-knell of the delicate . On a sugarcanepole in a corner are strung old dresses and coats and , crumpled in a corner , is a Ku Klux Klan hood like a caved-in ghost . The clothes hanging in the purple loftlight are shredded by claws and streaked by rain and drenched in light and burned through by ceaseless rays of sunlight and moonlight and starlight . They are ripped by teeth and gnawing ( almost as if in some kind of vengeance ) and the tiny punctures of the mouths of ants and moths , as if the wearing of life had left some sweet syrup on them . A gray , diaphanous veil hangs like a web and spun so fine by age that it seems a veil of light . Because these garments have been so long diffused with light and lights  --  through many washings and drenchings  --  their colors have faded and the lights have dyed them delicate pale Light colors . In an cave is a whole mosque of dirtdobber domes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasps . Curtains of gossamer hang tremblingpurple and luminous . In this wreckage the insects and creatures have made their artifice and their order : frail mouth-built or cilia-built structures , envelopes andp 126membranes and spun-out or spat-out fragile architecture , phantom and fantastic and terrifying . The faded pine walls wear ' Wear like a fabric , a garmentof speared and cometed and darted and spiraled grain , and grain designs like those on the sole of a foot ; and lacunae of lucent amber resin ; and serrated or glabroussurfaces : a landscape of figures of grotesque naked men and women among pools and hummocks and flumes ; and there are fantastic scrawlings and lewd phalliforms of grain . On one wall there is a terrible water-mark figure like the huge claw of an enormous bird grappling over a long dried pool of blood . There is an old cowboy hat felted with fuzz and fine agglutinated dust . A pale , watery green sea of Mason jars , and a pile of rubbish onions that had sprouted sickly lianas curlingover each other and then withered to crumble are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peanuts , slashed open by some hunger and spilled out like doubloons and now only shriveled husks . And there is a crock , cold to feel , and marbeled like an aged agate . There stands a churn that has not turned for years . And behold a group of dolls , limp and dignified , like ancestors sitting together ; and some blueing bottles filled with gentian light ; and a small tarnished silver key . Away in the farthest end of the loft a big rusted tusk of a plow curves out of the shadow . The loot of the loft lies like treasure in some thief 's lair , and the thief is everywhere so powerfully present I can feel him gathering and fumbling and destroying. p 127Yet all is so silent , except for a tinkling and occasional shiftings like the sound of a page turned in a book . And then I find the two chests that belonged to you . On the outside is printed GAYETY SHOWS AND COMPANY . Inside I find out your whole secret . Inside is a corroded violin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rat of hair ; some peeling gilded tap-shoes whose taps are thin from much dancing . And false faces , with tragic-gay bent down eyes , women 's wigs , tubes of make-up grease , and spanglesspilled over the clothes like dried fishscales . And there are fringed gypsy shawls , and scarves , crimson and jacinth and one green as a ragged peacock . I touch a scarf and it falls into air and light and seems to evanesce . And there is a yellow glove and here is a mandarin 's lavish emerald-mauve gown with sleeves hanging like pointed asses ' ears , with intricate work of golden braid laid tarnished over the hem . And here is a crushed paper bird on a stick . Sifted all among the treasures of the chests are lettersand photographs of many beautiful played-out people , like lost cards , dealt and used for win or loss and cast away . At the end of the loft room is an old dresser with a swung mirror . I go there . On the dresser is a pincushion made like a tomato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of beads and cameos and bracelets and balls of faded yarn . Spiders and dust have claimed them all . Next to the dresser is an old ruptured and gutted chair. p 128 " I give you this glass , " your voice whispers , " in which to see a vision of yourself , for this is why you 've come . My breath is on the glass and you must wipe away my breath to see your own image . " In the mirror I can not see myself but only an image of dust . I brush it off  --  and then see my portrait there . For a moment I look like Folner ! Within that cornered face , in the purple hollows and fosses of its umbrageous landscape , lie agonies like bruises ; this face is thus bruised unreal . But age and time have blown their rheumy breath on the mirror and curdled it and it clouds again . Then I blow my own breath upon the mirror and wipe it clear for another instant . I seem old , I seem unused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thief . The mirror seems to say , " Dance ! Swaggerwith a cane and sequins ! " I cry out , " Folner ! " in the loft . But only the rustle of startled creatures and the faint swinging of webs respond . ( I think he ate some kind of bitterweed and suffered a change for the eating and sprang away into a marveloushaunted and haunting world and never could return  --  although they waited in Charity for him  --  nor wanted to . Until he was washed ( as I am washed against this wall ) dead  --  like uprooted coral weed by some violenceonly the sea knows and only the sea-depths suffer , upon the oil-rimed and sawdusted shingle of Charity  --  and was claimed and buried there . They were all looking for him , waiting and watching , and looking for some grass that might take them to him  --  Grannyp 129Ganchion , Berryben , Malley Ganchion , Aunty , Sue Emma  --  and even I. And I , having not waited but wanderedfor him ( calling , " Draw me ; I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go you may not follow me. " ) , have come back here where I think I might find the magic he found among the bitterweeds and ate that liberated him and so myself be liberated into understanding and cruel authenticity . ) " Love in the cotton gin , my dear . And once , very early in the delicate watergreen shell of morning , in an old moored shellbarge on Green 's Bayou down around the Battlegrounds . We got tar on us . " The C.C.C . Camp at Groveton did n't help . Ah the East Texas woods in the fall , with flying red leaves like desires , and the smell of burning brush and that dangerous , voluptuous wind of a norther that stabbed the heart , so evil ; like Spanish Fly on the soul ... Do I shock you ? Of course I say these things , which are absolutelytrue , to shock you , you are so good , Boy , you and Berryben are so damned sweet and good , such damned sweet kids . " And you dazzled your opal cufflinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was that melancholy always over me , brooding over me . Why ? As far back as I can remember , lying on the pallet in the summer of the afternoons , there was the drone of the electric fan , like the drone of bees , and Mama going through the rooms in her slip . I felt frail and limp . It was justp 130sorrow bred in me , bred in you too , you 'll see ; we are the sons of grief at cricket . I had to stop it . " I was wild for the world of a flashing eye and life castanetting round and stomping an insinuating foot . Sometimes in Charity I could n't stand it any longer and would go out in the henhouse and make up dreams and play like I was something grand and royal and march up and down with a poker for a cane , with only the chickens to watch me . And then love myself and feel real again , a kind of tremor from the world ran through me . " Behold my talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led Young People 's programs , gave the main speech , sang a solo , then a duet with some girl , then said the final Benediction  --  it was all my show . Went to Conferences at Lon Morris College , even signed up to be a missionary . I was just looking for some passionate cause in the world to give myself to ( so are all of you , all of you )  --  can I help it if the Church petered out for me ? Then I turned to music and the stage . At the high school I was in every play that was put on and I even wrote an original musical show for the Senior Night ; and at Grace Methodist Church I was always directing plays , sang in the choir , sang solos , did impersonations on programs in FellowshipHall , played the piano by ear , anything that was make-believe . To make me forget that cisternwheel turning and turning and that old shuttered house and the family Sundays on the front porch. " 0 the drone of the flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown by a child on a comb and a piece of tissue-paper ; and the melancholy working of the wind in the trees and a whole dead town gleaming out before us in a false serenity under the burning sun of a fleecy summer Sunday sky with a piece of a moon in it , and nothing happening . " When the circus came to Bailey 's Pasture , I knew this was my chance . Remember how you and I and Aunt Malley went and what we saw and did , the yellow-skinnedgrinning freaks in their stalls with the sawdustfloor , twisted like worms the freaks grinned and ground in the sawdust ; and the screams of the animals in the menagerie and the sad , exciting music of the calliope ? I bought you a paper bird on a stick and here it is , crushed in this loft , to try to tell you something , to try to tell you , even then , that you were lost in Charityand that you had to get away , like me , chiming Charity Cock , to turn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , welded to Charity churchtops , chanting in the wind . Remember when I lifted you up on that big elephant , you little scared thing perched on that enormous back , you shook and cried and got so excited you almost fainted and Aunt Malley had to run to buy some lemonade and throw it in your face . We were going through the world in Bailey 's Pasturethat night , my own world , and I wanted to tell you then that I would never see you again and that the world was like this circus , stall by stall and dazzling Fairies Wheel , and lights and tights , whirling and gleaming and screaming and twisting on a sawdustp 132floor . ' We stood and watched the birdman clawing his scaly horned hands into the sawdust . Then I took you and Malley home and slipped away again , back to the circus ; and met a trapeze man with thighs in black tights ; and stayed and went away with the circus early that next morning . As we rolled away in our gay wagons , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping was the wheel turning over it , and the only one in that whole house that I cried for was you , Boy o Boy . " In San Antonio I left the circus and took tap dancingat Hallie Beth Stevens ' Studio of the Dance , sang out in front of a chorus of tapping girls , had a cane and a hat , and strutted singing , You 've Got Me in the Palm of Your Hand '  --  not before chickens in a Charity henhouse but a real clapping audience . " The rest I need n't tell you . Bailey 's Pasture was my revelation . " They treated me as though I was a freak in Charity , and I know it was just jealousy and envy . They blamed it on my mother , your Granny Ganchion , because she dressed me like a girl when I was little and called me Tonic . ' But it was more than that . Right away I learned what I was and went on like that , what I was , and used myself for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the same for most of the rest of Charity who do n't know who they are . What matters if it got me death ? " But if you 're going to start calling names , I can tell you a few things about Brother Ramsey in the 133church , who knew me all my life and even preached my funeral sermon , and who taught me a lot of what I know . Everything in this world is not black and white , as little Charity thinks ; there are shades in between . And I can tell some dirt on Jim Lucas and Mimi Day Calkins  --  sitting there in the Pastime Club with her finger in his fly  --  and Floydell Lucas , his wife , bent over a cradle at home singing a lullaby  --  and a lot of other things . ( We are all broken over the cradle , Boy . ) Nobody 's hands are clean in Charity . But let Charity flick its old toad 's tongue after the gay green and golden summer flies  --  and let them croak away that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be anything that they ca n't understand and give a name to . They had to have some ready label to lick and stick on you ; and when they could n't figure me out because I wanted different things from what they in Charity wanted , they started bullying me and torturing me . They were all really afraid of me  --  and most of them envied me , really envied me . " The whine and shriek of the planing mill was always in my head , as though they were dressing ship-lap in my brain . And that hard little mouth of hunger pressing hot against my soul . To be fed ! Who could feed it in Charity ? Oh Charity , I would thou wert cold or hot ; but because thou art lukewarm I will spew thee out ! " I take along some memories . The sight of the black watertower squatting like a fat-bellied reptile over Char-p 134ity eggs ; and the old house smelling of 0-Cedar Oil ; that old yard of guineas and cackling hens and the manure of cows . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we ? You little frightened thing , always frightened . On one Easter Sunday I taught you a secret . We rolled away some stone , remember ? " " And you do n't know how hard I prayed in the barn in the sunsets I thought were the burning end of the world , Follie . You made me feel so full of sin that I never mentioned your name to anybody ; and when once and a while they would say your name I would tremble and think they knew . When the Riverbottom Nigras came to town to tell that they had seen a Haint walking in the sloughs of the riverbottoms I knew it was you come back and at night I lay and watched , trembling on the wall , the shadow of the paper bird made by the firelight , and I thought I heard its annunciation : Come away ; and I had nightmares of a haunted bird at night , and never left the kitchen all day , sitting trembling by the woodstove . I thought I heard you at the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sitting in the Beantree with the three black hens that lived up there . When the preacher spoke about Sin it always had your face . I have just found your real face , Follie my Follie . " " Oh Boy , I had to have some drama in a life . I had a rhapsody in me . But it devoured me . I was so afraidp 135of what I found out that I began to run and run from it until I melted down into this death . Can you learn anything from this ? Tell it  --  for me ; someone has to tell it . " Somewhere beyond all this muck and dreck there lies a pasture of serenity and I will find it . I am on my way . Hang a wreath on the door of this fallen house for me . How did I die ? I invited Death . Because I was so very weary . The rest is a secret never to be told ( see seven crows ) . Leave us alone and we will destroy ourselvesin the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe the bridges of breath between our ruined and isolate islands . " I am the Ur-Follie of many derivations of your time . Find me on walls , most prophetically adumbrated ; in shadows of firelight ; bursting from clocks ; turning on steeples . And I am the beast-muzzled Prince , blacklippedand riverlapping , begging the miracle . Give , and change the Beast . Watch . " " I watch and watch and watch , Follie , and I will build a bridge between these ruined islands ; then blow the bridge of breath away . But the islands will remain forever like stone islands in a still and frozen sea . For we are only breath to blow and bridge eternal ruins while we breathe , until we are blown away . " p 136Open the cellar door ( that swings on hinges of web ) and cry down , " Granny Ganchion ! "  --  and rouse the worm called Old Fuzz that the children were always afraid of . Now Granny Ganchion , when you went down in the rootcellar so often I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the figs and apricots and pears like jewels shining in the Mason jars , shaped like the parts of love . I know you fondled and counted that string of rubyred beads like a rosary . Here in the cellar , once , when I came down for chowchow , sent by Aunty and trembling to see Old Fuzz , I first discovered where you were when I missed you in the house . I stood at the little cellar door and watched you who could n't hear me , sitting dressed in a yellow widebrimmed hat with boafeathers round it . I heard , rumbling in the heavens of your world overhead , while you sat down in your Purgatory praying yourself through your beads free of it and into a Paradiseof Fruit , the thunder of all their feet in their corn-p 137ing and going , so that their lives must have seemed to you below them only a walking or a rocking ; and I know now as you heard their footsteps you named them over , " There 's Christy , I can tell the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tryin to find me ; there rocks Malley over me in her rocker by the window , she is rockin across my skull . Coin and comin , backwards and forwards , from gallry to breezeway , they are all walkin and rockin over me and I bend still beneath them here like their dark root in the Charity earth . " All your desires were preserved in Mason jars . And then when you saw the light from the cellar door and me standing in it ( like what angel come in light through your door ? ) you jumped and made your uck uck sounds and then murmured , " Boy ! Boy ! " as though I was a lover called to you by your wishing for him and you were waiting , ready for him . And then I closed the door . They said I was pale when I came back without the chowchow and that it was because I had seen Old Fuzz in the cellar , and laughed and ate without it . But what I saw was the truth of you , Granny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in this cellar , and leave it here . I know you sat down here with Old Fuzz , that I always imagined to be like some great green-warted worm coiled down here , and that he said to you , " Hannah Ganchion , you got nothin in the world but a few hundred jars of rotten preserves and an old pair of rubyred beads . The rest is silence and no love and no brightness anywhere , only a house full of silent folks makin faces at you . And an old deadp 138husband , Gentry Ganchion , that used to say to you , All right , Hannah , then I swear to God I 'll go downtownto the City Hotel ! ' " ( and the time I heard the whores in the city jail , blessed damozels leaning their heads out the golden windows singing , " Bless them all , bless them all , the long and the short and the tall " ) " and him sneakin over to niggertown right from your own bed at midnight , while ever month there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rob Hill because he 'd raped an East Texis white woman " ( they said you were n't a man in East Texas until you 'd had a nigger woman ) ; " and you just finally drove him away and he went to St. Louis and died , alone , in a ConvalescentHome . " And you protested to Old Fuzz that you had Christy and that you had had Folner and that you had had a time in your own time . And then the worm flashed and said , " That 's a lie and a fairy tale ! You know it and the preserves know it and the rubyred beads know it . You know Folner 's done strange things like goin away with a show and everyone says there was somethinwrong with him  --  the time he came home in patent leather shoes and even had a permanent wave in his blonde hair proved it .

But it seems like I 'm talkin to somebody hearin me . Somebody settin someplace thinkin of all their life . . . What does that mean ? Thinkin how their life , now that it is near the end of their life , and all lives , uz like some book read , with some plot and story to it , and things happenin in it to make a long and unbelievable story  --  would anybody ever believe it if I told it ?  --  and how now they knew what their life as a story had been , just in one moment settin somewhere in a moment of clearin they see it 140clear and what was all in it , all along the line . So that they could tell it , after that  --  to who ? To theirselves is enough  --  like a made-up story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comin in suddenly where there are people gathered round and singin out the long long story of what had happened to them in their experience . And that this was it : how a person could come to them ( that was Vester Langley ) and in a orchard ( this was Hare 's orchard ) under flowers on boughs and under petals of broken flowers on the spring grass , and where there was danger of bein caught , and how for the first time in their lives they were touched and give up and let it happen . And then  --  uck tick  --  how a warmth like a ray of sun slipped in them , havin no shape or weight it seemed : quiverin , brilliant , feelin like a golden minnow or a goldfish and felt to them like the feel of a minnow slippin through the hand ; and then it lept and jerked and jackknifed like a leapin fish . And how , lyin under what would be in the summerfruit hangin on the fruittrees , they could , then , they learnt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be bladed by some blade , and set aglow like a Fourth a July night by this . " And then how they could go along ( this was still Vester ) and this happen here and that happen there , making things worst or making things better , and in the orchard the pears hung low and heavy and they touched them and loved them in their hands and then how they laid under the peartrees with the pears in their faces. p 141 " Oh there could be the pears that I put up , brought by by Mr. Hare . And those plums , they could be the blossoms I putt in my hair and that I laid under and had fallin on my face ( before it slid down like icin on a cake into this fallen face ) , that I laid on . Mind as well see that things come round to an end if you wait long enough . Look look at the fruit ! " ( I see the fruit in their jars like ruined aquariums with their corpses of fishes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden apricots ; the wizened sapless figs . ) " And then how at the end a summer Vester went off to the North and I was left alone . And how I waited and waited until another one came , and this was Jeff Cranberry and how I married him and how we went along , not too good , until he was shot in the buggy with me settin by him . I had a baby comin and that was Lauralee . Then the whole town made a fuss over me because I was a widow and a pretty one , and one who made a fuss was Gentry Ganchion and we married . Had Malley right away . Then nothin but sawmills forever after , I married sawdust . Then we come to Texis to the Charity Sawmill . The noon whistle and Gentry comin home for dinner . But in some year , when it t was I do n't know now , the Carnival come , and I spun a wheel and he knocked niggerbabies down to win these beads  --  he wanted to brush the sawdust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said let it be you 'll never brush that sawdust off . " Then Christy come . ' When Christy was made in me his maker made him in sorrow and tears in a wet p 142tent and on sawdust , and we cried together ; 0 Lord that face ! Bobblin and swimmin over me , that face before my face starin down on my face pressin against my face , with such sadness in it , eyes closed , eyes wild as storm moons , teeth grittin and mouth hot and pantin  --  over my face this face , ghost-faced , until it closed down upon me and fitted upon me like a mask and our faces melted into each other , his tongue slippin into my mouth , ready mouth , and our faces meltin into each other . . . Then all down the line and length of us we fitted and melted and mixed , swellin into hollow , knowin we uz made for this , like tongue n groove . . . . And I rocked him in the cradle of myself ...

" And then we went out and threw baseballs at niggerbabiesand he won me this pair of beads . " But when Follie was made , Gentry laughed ( he always laughed ) and bleated like a wild goat .

" p 146What was this manwith a long houndface and a glistening silver eye who tacked this map to the kitchen wall and gazed and gazed at it ? ( How old and worn the world looks now ! From too much gazing Christy faded the world like too much light on colors ; he has taken the luster into himself and looked the luster into me , stamped it upon my skull so that my skull became a globe of the world . ) His image is teardrops of birds ' blood speckled on his denimed thigh , a waist girdled by a wreath of small dead birds , an axe-wound 's scar secret on my thigh . And about his image there resounds an echo of french harp music and of clashing beaks of horn . Christy was big and had dark wrong blood and a glistening beard , the bones in his russet Indian cheeks were thick and arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great silver eyes shaped like bird 's eggs were set in deep  --  half-closed eyes furred round by grilled lashes that laced together and locked over his eyes . p 147He was a hunting man ; and hunted ; and his mother Granny Ganchion was a shaggy old falcon that had caught him like a surrendered bird and held him close to her , home ; as though he had been hunted in his own hunting , the hunter hunted ; and captured : by trap or talon ; or treed ; or set or pointed at and stalked in his own secret woods and brought home , driven towards stall and what forage , at nightfall , to her , the hunter 's huntress . He had had one friend before me , he said , and that was his mother ( 0 cries into a deaf world ! ) who could not hear him , only read off his lips his passion that lay so fair and lovely , trembling on his full wienercoloredlips . He had just talked so long into deafness that he came to judge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything much ( could or would he be heard ? ) . It was what he did n't say that said what he said ( I think I know now what he did n't say ) . He became a man of gestures : shrugging his humped shouldersunder his workshirt like a big bag carried there ; waving his long scarecrow arms with raveled strips of fingers , long-nailed and hanging down at the end of his arms like the raveling out of arms ( the isinglass nails shaped like oval shells were bent over sharp and tough at the ends as roosters ' spurs are ) ; throwing his great dark head from side to side or tossing it up and down in horse movements ; and , in his despairs , heaving up in the air the whole huge , buoyant , winged upper portion of his body , arms and bladed torso , like enormous agitatingwings of a huge and sinewed man-angel . Christy made everything seem an evil secret  --  the p| 148songs he sang to his guitar : " Write me a letter , send it by mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , " and he would be in jail singing this song because he had done something wrong in the woods or with the Mexicans . He had a circumcision-like scar , pink and folded , on his brown neck over which he would gently rub his fingers and tell me how it was a knifecut because of love . ' When Christy yodeled , flashing his silver eye , " You get a line , I 'll get a pole ; we 'll go fishin in a crawdadhole , Ba-abe , " he was telling me long , long stories of woods-meetings . He would go off hunting ( in Folner'ssame woods ) , leaving me behind and wondering ( " One day when you 're old enough I 'll take you huntin with me , we 'll go huntin , Boy " ) and then come back to us as though he had been in some sorrow in the woods , with birds ' blood on him and a bouquet of small , wilted doves hanging from his waist over his thigh , or a wreath of shot creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broken mouth of agony . Then he would come to me and speak , for he had found words , " Listen Boy , listen ; come out to the woodshed with me quick and let me show you somethin , come with me , quick ; by Gum I 've got somethin . . . " What would he show me if I went ? They said around Charity that he did the thing that would make you crazy if you did it too much ; they said he was a niggerlover ; they said he was a KuKlux ; they said he was adopted by Granny Ganchion and was a no-good Peepin Tom whose parents were probably for-p 149eigners or Jews or thieves in the Pen ; and some of this was true and he was bad . But after he dived down into the river and found Otey , his wife , and brought her up to the shore , drowned , he was a different man . He hated Folner , said he had to squat to pee and did n't have enough sense to pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a mother ( " Folner came when I was fourteen and Mama was sick , sick before he came ( the way I knew he was comin was when I asked Mama if she had a pillow stuffed there and she said , No , it 's going to be a little baby ' ) , sick to almost dyin when he was born ( and had to have him Cicerian , Follie came out her side , came into this world sideways ) , and sick always afterwards . I was Follie 's mother all those years , makes me part woman and I know it and I 'll never get over it . How I rocked him and how I slept warm with him at nights , rolled up against my stomach and how I never left him day nor night , bless his little soul , settin on the gallry with him on my knee while I watched the others comin and goin across the pasture to town and back from town , to Chatauquas and May Fetes . Until he changed . What was it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing all day , by hisself , turned away from me , somethin wild got in his eye , and then Mama took him back . Began to wear Mama 's kimona and highheeled shoes and play show , dancin out from behind a sheet for a curtain ; and then I turned away from him . . . . Oh what does it mean tellin and rememberin all this  --  except that it has made me what I am right now : somebody settin here tellin and remem-p 150berin what made them what they are right now . . . " ) ; he had raised him like a mother until Folner turned away from him and hated him , and then Christy said he was a sissy and a maphrodite ( but they joined again in the woods  --  where I joined them too ; and now we all join in the world ) . He would say whispered things about animals : udders , the swinging sex of horses , the maneuvers of cocks , bulls ' ballocks and fresh sheep  --  he was in some secret conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gypsies and the Mexicans , and often he would clink in his hand some dangerous-lookingtin cockspurs that he used for his fighting roosters . But after a roosterfight with the Mexicans or a hunt in the woods , Christy would be quiet and then sit all day close to Granny whittling little figures ; and once he carved a perfect ship and put it in a bottle . Out in the woodshed Christy played a french harp cuddled in his trembling hands , blowing and sucking sounds like birdcalls and moaning voices of animals ; and before I knew him I lay in my bed hearing these sounds like a mystic music played from the moon that rocked like an azure boat in our sky , framed by my window . Everything Christy never said was whispered , lipped , blown into his french harp ; and his pale wet lips curled like some delicious membrane ; or like the workingsof fishes ' mouths that might be saying something under water . He had had a little wife named Otey and they had lived sometime together in a shack up the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she to her folks at Clodeen and he back to Granny Ganchion . Otey had big daisy eyes , yellow with lashes like sun rays radiating from the hazel centers ; and a sunlight shone from them . But her hands were long and frail and purplish , shaped like frogfeet , with tiny white bones white under the skin . 0 her frail frogfeet hands holding a bouquet of Cups and Saucers brought from the fields to Granny Ganchion ! ( who always sneezed immediately ) . ( Granny would say , " Christy what 's the matter with Otey , she 's as white as a pile of chalk ; pore as a snake . " " She 's just tarred , Mama , " Christy would say . " She 's such a sunk-in little thing , all bowed over . I do n't see how she 's worth much at her chores , that Otey 's sick , Christy , her skin 's real crepey . " ) They would come down the sandy road , Christy deep in his silence , Otey 's bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , coming bent over , and good , down the road to the house . Christy would say , " Otey we got to go and be with Mama , Mama 's lonesome . " Then they would come down to us and Christy and Granny 'd just sit , not saying a word much , Granny uttering her uck uck sounds because of her goiter , that sounded like an old setting hen safe with her eggs . Sometimes if they did n't come , Granny would say , " Why do n't Christy come down to see me ; why do n't none of my children ever come to see me ? " And then she would send me up the road after Christy . I would find him sitting on their little porch , p 152huge and quiet , and Otey no place to be found . Then Christy would call into the trees for her , sounding her name through all the woods ; and finally she would come , very softly and bent over from the trees , holding some wood she had gathered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otey , " he 'd say . " Mama wants us . " I know that while he sat on the little porch of his shack in the woods , voices called to him , " Come home , come home , " and that the doves moaned this and the owls hooted it , " Come home , come home " ; and that I must have seemed to him like another bird when I came to him from the house calling , " They want you home . " Then once , in the hottest summertime , he came to me and whispered to meet him in the woods to catch a mother possum and her babies . I trembled to go , and slipped away and met him . I saw him waiting for me ( like a lover ) , I saw him sitting on a stump watching me as I came , closer and closer , feeling evil , feeling guilty . We rejoiced ( without words ) at our meeting secretly . The mother possum lived in the rotten stump of an old tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an axe . Because I came too close to him once he came down on my thigh with his axe  --  so gently that he only cut a purple line under the skin and no blood came . I almost fainted and fell to the ground but did not cry . But Christy wept and begged me not to tell anyone and tied his bandanna tightly round the wound and hugged me and trembled ; and I have never told. p 153I have carried on my thigh the secret scar he left me ( 0 see the wound on this thigh left by that hunter 's hand ! ) and have never told . But we got the little possums and put them in a chicken coop at night . The next morning they were gone  --  as if they had never been there and we had only caught them in a dream of mine ; yet I saw the purple axewound on my thigh and found a hole scratched out under the chicken coop , and so I knew it really happened , and that no one but Christy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long time of waiting in which I knew there was a preparation for something . Within this waiting ( was Christy waiting too ? ) we looked at the map together or I watched him make the ship in the bottle or heard the french harp in the woodshed . And then one summer night I learned his truth ( and mine ) . It was through a window that I learned it when , wondering what he was , I squatted in the garden duckingdown under the peavines , outside his room , and watched him through leaves of moonlit vines . It seemed he was floating above me and that I was seeing him through thin-shaled waving leaf and light patterns of water ; and the light through the tiny bones of waving leaves made him have green feathery lines winnowing over his body and he was spotted and speckled with dark leafshapes , marked like a fish . From where I watched him from below it seemed he might at some moment dive down to me and embrace me and there speak and say , " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " There , in the garden , I , like an Eve , found him leaf-shadowed ( and , like Eve , leaf would forever after make me stop to remember ) . There he lay , among vines now , so beautiful in his naked sleep , and so stilled ( I thought )  --  a hot liquid summer night filling the world with the odor of greengrowing and moonlight  --  greengoldenunder the light he had fallen asleep with still on , little cupids of gnats wafting round him . I found him hairy with a dark down , and nippled , and shafted in an ominous place that I seemed to have so known about always in my memory , not new , although suddenly like a discovery , that I whispered to myself " Yes ! "  --  as though I was affirming forever something I had always guessed was true . He lay among the vines decorated with a stalked flower  --  or was it a flame licking up out of him  --  so quiet , yet with some inner commotion going on within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered like this , all gentle and in his prime and bloom : he lay blooming among the vines , in my moonlight ; and in all this soft night I had him before me , eternal shape of man , all my own discovered resplendentprize in the world , caught unfolded like a flowerless daytime plant into its unsurmised nightflower by the wild eye of a little animal , glorious in his solitary unsuspectedblessing ( yet somehow always known about  --  we all know , how ? ) and diving in his dream of quest for something to pull to him and embrace in some glory , through some power that would create him man , defined , real , continuing man in me , through the window . Snakes , I thought , slough , under ' ferns , in their time , p 155and what eye sees them ? Shells open at their tide and moon on shores where only moon sees and tide knows : I am something old and mysterious and wise as moon and tide ; for I have seen ; and I will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . 0 what was it in the life of things that prized open the shells , lifted up the bloom off stalks , and slipped the skin off serpents , on and on and on ? Then I climbed up in the chinaberry tree and looked at him again and it seemed he was lying in the branches , bough in bloom or fruit on a tree . After that I knew how beautiful he could be , that he had his beauty cursed or blessed , as though it was smitten , on him , close as flesh ; and when I later saw all adornments of bodies and of the world : spires of ancientchurches where birds lived among bells as though the birds were flown-out bells ringing in the sky ; light through stained glass Creations of naked Adams on windows ( and Adams expulsed , with hands like leaves coveringtheir flower that , in another garden , had caused all Christy 's woe ) , signs seen on boughs and bodies , flowers and gems and flames ; stars , eyes : the torment of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands like wings of birds  --  I recalled him that I saw like my creation of man , through a window , floatingand flowering in my early moonlit darkness among the peavines and the boughs of the chinaberry tree  --  and thought that this vision must be the meaning of boy beholden to man . I went out in the road and walked in the moonlitp 156sand and thought , 0 when I am ready , really ready , and filled with blood , I will go , before I die and in my strength , hung with my beauty blooming close upon my flesh and this vision burned upon my brain , in the spring , through all the land , sowing it with my substance , lying under fruittrees in meadows and on hills with all the young ; and brush the leaf away . And we will fill the world with our sighs of yes ! and make it sensual like rain , like sun , like scents on wind , being blossoms and pollen : flowing and flying coupled over the world and sowing our wealth into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the world an orchard . And then , finally , it was the time Christy had whisperedabout . We rose early and went away into the woods in a blue , wet world to hunt together . The sky was streaked like broken agate , as if the huge bowl were porcelain or agate and had been cracked ; and it seemed there were no clouds anywhere in the world . Christy and I were sleepwalkers going away from a house of breath and dream . The sound of a chopping axe echoed in the acoustics of the agate heavens . I was so afraid ; we were going , it seemed , towards some terrible mission in the woods . The sad , dirty face of Clegg 's house looked at us as we passed it . A fragile , melodious Oriental language blew in on the wind like the odor of a flower and we saw the string of smoke from a gypsy camp somewhere in the woods . The sliding of our feet in the road flushed a flutter of wings from the bush . The fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legged things were going where they would , no engine or human to stop them . Out in the fields under the thick brush and in the grass and green were myriad unseen small things that were running or resting from running . Under the trees as we went we swept back the webs and broke them as we went . What was this terrifying rising of something in me , like a rising of fluid ? Some wild and mourning thing was calling and claiming me . It was autumn and the time of the killing of hogs ; there were squeals in the distance . Dandelions whirled like worlds of light . Hickorynuts were falling . Folner lay buried in the graveyard ; and Otey , too . We only looked that way , toward the graves , as we passed , and carried their lives within us as we went towards the woods . We climbed a little hill and he stood for a moment on the hill , all his life breaking with loneliness and memory inside him , looking down on the country of Charity behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Aunty 's room . As we came down the hill on the river 's side we were walking down the slopes of the strangest , yellowest world to a wide field that seemed the color of a pheasant 's wing . And then a bird appeared . Instantaneously Christy shot it dead . He picked it up and we went on . We passed the carious ruins of an old shed . Two Negro women appeared from behind it . " Blackbirds ! " some voice said . " We can watch them wash in the river ( ever seen a nigger 's tits ? Big as coconuts . . . ) . " But we went on . And then we came into the bottomlands where the 158palmettos were turning yellow . At the river , which seemed to have just waked and was clucking in its cradle , we saw the leaves falling into the river . Now not a living creature ran or rustled . There was only the occasionalcomma of dropped cones punctuating the long flowing syntax of the river 's sentence . Then the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drugged in the early morning and creeping so slowly that where many leaves had fallen and gathered the river seemed a river of leaves . These were Folner 's woods . What had he found here or left ? Once we saw , in the sand , the prints of knees left by someone who had kneeled and drunk from the river ; and then I saw Christy get down on his hands and knees and drink like a beast from the river , and I saw the signs his body left there . We walked along under the ragged trees and pieces of them were forever falling falling about us as we went ; as though the world was raveling into pieces and falling upon us as we went , Christy ahead , silent and huge under his hunting cap , his isinglass nails shining , and I behind , afraid and enchanted . No fishes were making the noise a rock makes dropped in the water ; only a watermoccasin , once , was skiffing along soundlessly with his brown head erect like the head of an arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dreams , Christy and I  --  come from the house filled with its voices , going towards our reality that , once found and taken , would fall away again into dream. p 159And then a purring , gurgling sound came as if it were the river ; but it was Christy 's french harp . We passed a muscadine vine with grapes that had some silvery french harp music 's breath blown on them . There was the sound of the hopping of birds on leaves . And then Christy suddenly shot at a turtle that looked like a rock , and got him . He shot again and a dove fell , followed by the falling blessing of feathers . He looked at me , asking me to pick up the fallen dove . I picked it up , ruined . We went on . We were going after all marvelous things ; silently ; he going ahead blowing and sucking his french harp ; I behind , timid , and terrified and marching in an enchantmentby the music in the woods . For a time he was leading me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was following in a kind of glory , and eager , and surrendered , and wanting to follow  --  just as he was , in his own dumb sorcery and splendor , leading me , victor , proud , like a captive . But the uncaptured , unhypnotizedpart of me was afraid , wanting to run home ( where was home to run to , towards where ? ) ; for I knew he was leading me to a terrible dialogue in the deepest woods . All his hunting , all his shooting and gathering up of shot birds was a preparation  --  like a meditation in which there is a collection of words , for prayer or protestationor farewell or betrayal  --  in which he would tell me some terrible secret . In it he would finally , after making me wait until I was almost mad with desire for words from him , tell me all the Evil and arm me for all the Joy that there could be and be had , in the world ; p 160and I would have no one to tell it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , only the hunt and this boy . But until the moment of speech in the deepest shadowed woods where it seemed we would be in a cistern , let down alone together for this terrible revelation of secrets , Christy 's silence was the ringing starry soundlessnessof night in the woods , of deafness got from his mother . ( I carried his news for years within me until now I tell it . Evil comes free to you , it has been purchasedfor you as a gift . But steal Joy , he told me , find it and rob it out of the world , suffer for it but steal Joy like a thief of despair . ) ( " Yet that 's what Folner did and you despised him , " I would answer him if we could have a conversation now  --  0 Christy , if you were here ! We could have a conversation . ) Now the river flowed like his own wordless speech . We looked across the river toward the ahead  --  long flat brown land  --  and we wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ahead . He said to me fly away from here  --  I give you these bird 's wings to fly away with from here where we are all just the sawed-off ends of old tubafours rottin on a sawdust heap ; fly up and away , across the river past Riverside and on away . And what brings you down will be what gave you wings to fly up and away , will be what needs to use you to speak with ; be bird , be word . ( Yet as we went , " come home , come ho-o-me , " the voices called . The doves moaned this and the owls hooted it , " come home , come ho-o-me . .. " ) " But when I would run home , what would there bep 161for me to do ? Only set by Mama while she rocked and hear her go uck uck in her throat and watch the goiter sliding up and down under her lank skin , rising and falling . But in the woods I had my life  --  and in some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds ! What went by ? Wings ! 0 wing me over ! Come over , come over , let Christy come over ! Hell-o ! Hell-000 ! Listen to the echo 0-0-0 ! suffering from the other side . But Boy , we 'll send you over . When he runs to me , bringing a bird , it is Freshness , Newness , Unusedness running to me  --  0 come to me ! Let me touch your untouched newness ( I am old and cold , but burning ) . Let me shoot you like a shining cartridge over the river and into the fields of the world . " To swim like a fish up the river to the mouth , 0 Great Mouth to swallow me in , home to the end . 0 my blue face !

And then how I sat down dizzy on the banks and wept , on the banks of the river I cried  --  by the waters of the Charity I sat down and wept . 0 Otey I had you at last , I had you , caught in my hands , alone and wrapped together in the soft crepedesheen cloths of the waters of Charity I had you , nekkid I had you , below the surface of the river , where above they all satp 162waitin for us ; and when we came up to the top and the light and world you were dead and I was deaf and dumb and blind . They laid us both on the shore and one of us never did come to , and that was you . " But now let us go  --  we are going after it , what we never had . If it lies across the river , I can not cross the River . 0 Bird ! Wing me over the River ! This young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us , we will send him over . I will tell him to go , by killing the next bird I will tell him to  --  there 's the wing of a dove , sounds like a flying french harp . . . Got it , by gum , look at the falling wings , look , look at the falling wings ! Let Boy run to get it like any birddog . Hey , young sad birddog , Hey , Birddog ! He is fresh to be used , this cleanpeckered boy , keep him away from the niggers and the cows , keep him away from himself , keep him from the fruits like Follie , my own brother . There 's another beak  --  it 's a woodpecker  --  tell him by the stopping of a woodpecker 's pecker  --  Zing ! got him , by gum ( Hey , Birddog ! ) . " To wash out my mind of all these remembrances  --  who can I tell , to get rid of them , them to ? Boy will listen , he is just nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell him with words when the moment comes . It will be in the thicket and he will be waitin for it , he is always waitin to hear . Children are the ones to tell things to , they are the only keepers of secrets in the world . I 'll tell Boy ( Hey , Birddog ! ) . " I remember an Owal . I remember a blue Owal in a cave by the bend of this river . I saw him at twilight asp 163we were headin home from our huntin trip , ' Walter Warren , 011ie Cheatham and myself ( the men coughin in the tents at night ; the sad dyin fire dyin down in the cold ; the night with stars caught in my mosquitobar up over me , and me cold upon the ground hearin only a call of some animal off somewhere , a stream runnin on , the coughin of Walter Warren and 011ie , and the chokin of the fire . In the smells I smelt was a whole world that could never be , only be breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  someone to be this smelt world with , be still with me ! to be calm with ! someone to be still in ! ) ; first , I felt somethin in that grotto , then I looked and it was the blue Owal . I never told anyone , but I knew there was an Owal in there . I 've remembered that Owal for years , for fifteen years that Owal 's been in the cave of my memory , settin there blue and still . What does anything settin like that mean ? What does Mama mean , settin there in that house ? In that cellar ? There 's a meanin ! There 's a meanin ! Onetime we stood on a hill and looked down at the crawlin river below . There were animals down there , I do n't know what kind , could n't make em out , but I could feel animals down there . There was a huge moon about to bust in the sky . Suddenly lookin down there , with the moon heavy over me and the animals movin around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , way back somewhere , the way you do , you know , the same kind of feelin  --  it was in Deridder Loosiana , when we was all there and kids , and Papa was travelinfor the rayroad ; and one night in my room I wasp 164waked up by the feelin of the sky pressin down on me , and of somethin movin , some life of some kind rustlin around me , and I went to the winda and looked out to see this big lopsided moon about to bust in the sky and across in the next house I saw a bare arm reach out from a bed and slowly pull down the shade . As the shade was comin down I saw legs wound around in some kind of fightin ; and then the light went out . I squatted there and could n't hear nothin , could n't see nothin , but I knew there was some commotion of life goin on in there in that blinded room , I could feel it . ( There 's a meanin ! There 's a meanin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this was like that , insect legs locked , and there was a kind of huge flight , of enormous but everso-lightleapin , and beatin of a kind of wings : a risin and a flutterin and a fallin . Then I thought how two can be caught in some crisis that they seem to be desperately tryin to get out of together , strugglin to help each other yet each wrestlin to get somethin the other has and wants to give up but is waitin to give it up just a little longer , wo n't give it up ( 0 when . . . Hurry hurry . . . ) , and in which there is pain ; and wordlessness ; and tears . For I knew , even then , that we all have got somethin in us that will give pain , that will make somebody go uhuh uhuh uhuh and wag 's tongue and roll 's eyes and breathe as though he is gaspin or suffocatinwith the croup , or say whew ! whew ! as though he is burnt ; and almost die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will do almost anything . All those years I would do anything , anything to get this pain  --  but then it got top 165where the pain I wanted could not be reached by any hands , it moved down so far inside me that nothin could reach it . Oh Lord , from all that happens to anybody in this world you 'd think they 'd never want to live ... ) And then I knew that there was a fight goin on in the world  --  for things I dreamt of but never thought you could get , but so wanted , so wanted . And then 0 I wanted to holler out because I was so clost to bustin like the moon , because I was so lonesome and so lonesome , and there was nothin I could do , bein eighteen , because I so wanted legs wound around me and to fight and to be pressed down on , hot and soft , but do the thing that will make you crazy , and be afraid to look Mama in the eye because of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , watchin for the stallion to take the mare . It was fall and the weeds were brown and live with seeds rattlin over me . As I laid there I could hear the bellow of the bull in 's pen for Roma the cow out in the pasture . I waited and waited and just about dark Good Lord it happened . How the mare screamed and how the stallionleapt with 's hooves in the air like a great flyin horse of statues ; and I thought , I am as strong as this winged stallion but nobody knows it and I will say nothin of it , keep it to myself . ' As I laid in the fields , somewhere in me I was fillin with blood , and suddenly somewhere I was full and throbbin with blood . ) " Then again , once , in Shrevesport when we had all moved there ( it snowed and we were cold in our first snow and Mama took all us kids ridin ever Sunday onp 166the streetcar to the end a the line and back ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in a jewelry store that I was lookin in at in the rain suddenly there was an arm and a white hand that reached down into the brightest winda among all the glitterin diamonds and gold bands there and then disappeared again . I stood and waited in the rain till I was drenched , but no more white hand came down again . ( Some white hand to reach down ! 0 reach us out a hand ; this hand has birds ' blood on it , has a crooked knuckle broken by a baseball hit out to me in centerfield in a game at Charity when we played the Bloomer Girls by that tomboy Sis Moody . ) And then I walked and walked in the rain that turned into snow and I was drenched and frozen ( but burnin ) ; and walked upon a park that seemed like the very patch of Hell where there was couples whisperin , men to men and men to women , and I went into a city toilet and saw drawn pricks hangin long on the wall and messages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilets erupted up onto the floor and I had trod in it . Then I came out and felt alone and lost in the world with no home to go home to and I felt robbed of everthing I never had but dreamt of and hoped I could have , I felt fouled by the filth of what men leave and had left behind them ; and then I thought , 0 I am young and have somethin to give and to be used and to write on a wall . ' But I had no memory of anything beautiful or of my own to call inside me to , to name and touch ; I could only go , in my mind , through the rooms of the house and find no one I couldp 167join with for anything , or speak to ; and I thought , I will return , then , to my aloneness and fold back my secrets into it with me and we will be folded together there in a secret and silent place that will never be broken into , I will dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never had and hold it there , away from everbody on the outside of me .

For what I 'll put into him he cai n't forget or wish away , it is the truth of the world , and of walls , and of men ; and he must endure it and take it into hisself willingly and keep it in the world , proclaim it. ) " 0 misery ! I swear I never touched a woman or a girl or anybody until it got to where I had to . " At Daisetta , when I was stayin in the summer with the Chanceys , me and Dave were in the yard when Sarah , the biggest of us all , came out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and showed us her beginnin breasts , raw like a young sow 's , and we went in the house where nobody was and took turns feelin of em ; and then the little girl , Mary , came in and said , Want to see mine ? ' and showed us where there was nothin at all yet but shriveled places , like a man 's . All that summerSarah was after us , cryin , You Merry Widows ! ' " 0 Otey why did what happened have to happen ? I married you too young . She lived in a house way backp 168in some trees and was just a funny kind of bowed-over girl ( from carryin brothers and sisters on her hip ) that hardly ever came out of the trees into town , with a lot of the yellowest cornsilky hair and a loose dress with no belt . Why did n't they tell her that when we married I would want to touch her ? She screamed and ran from me that wedding night out the door and down the rayroadtracks and slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that left a scar like a shriveled apricot . She was a rabbit in the house after I brought her back pantin and damp from runnin , and bloody , and then I was dyin dyin to touch her and could have almost killed her in my hands she was so limp and little and white ; but I said , All right , little Otey , I 'll wait for you , I 'll wait until you grow up big enough to be my wife . ' " I was workin at the sawmill then , strawbossin the niggers with the mules that pulled the logs from the kiln to the plane , through the black sawdust in the mud , surrounded by the tearin sound of the cuttin of the logs , like goods bein ripped all day long . I 'd go home at dinner and she 'd have good butterbeans and peppersauceand corn bread for me like I like and we 'd eat and O Lord I 'd want to touch her but I would n't . Then they sent me out to the Thicket with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole month and I would not touch any niggers or any of the Indians that lived on the reservation around there ; and when I come back Otey was gone . She had run home ; and I let her stay ; I did n't blame her . I went home , back home , and p 169Mama said , Here is where you belong , come on back to this house with all of us . " I never told that I had never touched her  --  and no one ever knew . But I 'll tell Boy , this little listener will listen , I 'll tell him when the time comes . " And then one day Sam Riddle come to say three girls swimmin in the river by White Rock had fallen in a deep hole and they had got two out but the third was drownded and would I come hep dive for the body of the third . I went with them and got to the river and they said to me the third one was Otey Bell . I took off all my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down down to China it seemed , prayin to touch Otey there , and in time ; and Lord God I touched her . Then I opened my eyes quick and saw a sight I 'll see in dreams until I die : Otey was sittin bent over with her head on her knees in some sorrow , and nekkid , and I grabbed her hair and crushed it in my hands for a second ; and then I caught her hands with my hands and we were joined , just by our fingertips , so lightly , and came up slowly slowly . It was so long comin up , like a lifetime of Otey and me bein together in a darkness , alone and not sayin a word  --  but the bubbles of our breath were bathin us , we were wrapped in the bubbles of our breath , and they were our words speakin for us  --  and I prayed Lord Lord do n't let me lose Otey , do n't let me let her get away this time , because she had surrenderedto me at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with me so quiet without fightin , and I was nekkid with her . Bubbles of her last breath rose and p 170sprayed my loins and clung to the hairs on me like diamonds breathed out by her and we must have looked beautiful to fishes in our underwater marriage , glitterin with diamonds of breath and risin nekkid and touchin ever so lightly at our fingertips together , joined and flowin into each other , up to the shore . As we rose up together all our life that we never had together happenedwithin me  --  Otey cookin and singin in our warm winter kitchen and me choppin wood in the mornins . As we floated up through watery vines and ferns and slippery roots through scales and petals of sunlit water , layers breakin open over us as we broke through them like thin leaves of silver , I remembered that a hand does let down to you if you get lonesome and lost enough , that a big broken birdbloodied hand does reach down to you , wet and alone and so lonesome ; and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as we came somethin suddenly burst inside me and this was for love and for Otey , drowned but rescued Otey . I did get to the top with her and then those on the banks saw what it was and Jim Moody yelled , ' Christy 's found her , ' and jumped in to help but I was nearly passed out and thought they were tryin to take Otey away from me , and this time it seemed she wanted to stay with me , even nekkid , and I fought them off like a wilecat . Then Jim Moody hit me hard up against the head and that was all I remember till I woke up lyin out on the bank with the feelin of Otey 's fingertips on my fingertips . And I looked over to see the three boys rollin poorp 171Otey over a log to try to get the riverwater out of her lungs ; but she was drowned dead . " When I was young because I was big and bighandedthey used me like a plowox  --  but I had in me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us , flies over us always over us , and we must bring it down ; somethin is under , down under , and we must bring it up for ourselves and for everbody . " I was mean and wrong and unused until my one moment that lasted all my lifetime , it seemed , going down to find Otey  --  now I know what going down to find anything means : go down , Boy , after what is folded over like a child of sorrow , egg in its nest , and is all your life and love never had for your own , never owned but always waitin to embrace and hold warm to you , and bring it up , pullin it up with all the strength you 've got in you to pull up anything with , holdin it just by your fingernails ( that I bit them , once ! ) , bring it up through all the darkness of the world , through all the circles of mizry , to the top and deliver it , though gone , though unbreathin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always belonged , to the rescuers of the perished on the shore . For below the level where we are nothin but nekkid murmurins and whisperins over the world , only breath breathin dialogues in bubbles : rememberin , and yearnin , grievin and desirin , we are the life that lasts in us and has its meanin in us all ; we touch there where we have never touched before , in the only world where we can touch and join and enter into one another forever. p 172 " We 'll go to the cemetery , we 'll go take flowers to the graves.

( If your Uncle Jack was on a mule and could n't get off would you help your Uncle Jack off ? ) " We had come into the deepest gloom of the woods , vauted by enormous pinetrees , called the Thicket , and I knew it was time . I had a garland of birds Christy had shot and I had run to gather like flowers in a wild enchantment . . . . How long had we been hunting ? We were standing by a pool of the river . I looked at my quivering image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing through me . A purple snake glided over my image and Christy shot it , tearing my image into pieces . And then he sat down on a stump ( oh is that stump p 173covered over with blooming vines now ? do birds or possumsnest in it ? ) , looking as tired as if he had lived through all the ages , and with such a longing and such an ageing in his face that I backed away  --  for he looked like a beast in the woods , shaggy and gray and fierce . Yet some enormous tenderness was rising out of him . His look asked for something that I could not give because I had not learned how to give it . I backed away , backed away and he sat still on the stump . He pointed his gun at me to shoot me like a bird ; and I backed away . And then he lowered his gun and watched me and let me get away ; and then I ran . I ran and ran and felt myself melting down as I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight and soon it would be dark . 0 which way was home ? The sun was setting . I ran and ran . All the woods were now saying the same things to me that I had heard during the long and timeless hunt with Christy . Something like stars was twinkling in my loins . I prayed . Moss hung from trees like long hair and I saw the little green fuzz on rocks . What would I ever do with all this that had been said to me , now that Christy knew I knew all this ? I would pray against it . I walked praying through the woods . 0 which way was home ? The sad dusk was falling , and I was lost , lost . There was a kind of purring of the woods before dark . Which way was home ? I had left Christy alone in the woods and night was coming . I called , " Christy Christy ! " but only the woods , faraway , called him too ; and he did not answer . Then I cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Only an echo answered and no answer from Christy came . Some burden weighed upon me , some yoke around me . I was by the river . There , in a place , I suddenly saw the print of Christy 's body in the sand where he had kneeled down to drink , and I kneeled into it and drank as Christy had and felt at that moment that I was Christy drinking from our River . As I kneeled somethingswung against my face like petals of flowers and it was the birds Christy had shot and I had tied by their little legs to a string , as fishermen do fish , and had strung them round my neck . I saw that I was dappled by the blood of birds and that the beaks had beaten against my bare arms as I had run and brought my own blood there , mixed with the blood of birds . I ran on again with his yoke of birds swinging against me , Christy 's message to me . I ran blessed with his yoke of loves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broken and speechless , sentences of his language shot out of his air and off his trees ' boughs that were his words ' vocabulary : flying words that call at twilight and twilight , nest and hatch and fly free for others , yet caged in his birdcage of mind , and betraying him , but freed by my hand on his hand ; and brought down solid and sullied by beebee shot from his air by his own aim and fire ( misfire ! ) for me to gather and make speak : answer to his caged whisper : with tongues of birds . I ran marked and stained . How would I ever wash away all this blood of birds ? 0 now he was bird and Ip 175was bird , he was my truth and my untruth , he was my victim , he contained me , I possessed him . Now it was dark and I was full of fears . In a pond I passed , the moon lay fallen and small and mean among weeds and fallen branches . All birds were calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to shoot them , safe and homing at nightfall . 0 who would welcome me home when I finally got home ? Now the woods seemed a huge web that held Christy like a caught insect in it . Now I really loved Christy , longed for him , calling to him ( 0 where was he ? ) . We had come to the woods in a dream and in a quick dream he had faded away from me . The ripe cracking of his gunshot like the splitting of a ripe tree fired in my head . That I betrayed Christy ! That I failed him in the woods , he who gave me all these gifts of birds , who spoke for the first time to me and waited for me to answer ! To whom would I answer , to whom in the house would I answer when I came back , over the sea of bitterweeds of Bailey 's Pasture riding in home , bottlednews to be broken against the hands of the House that sealed the bottle ? What he had put into me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked and stained upon my body was to be carried away , through the bitterweeds , across the River and into the world to be read out to the world . If I could only find him again to tell him this , for he would want to know . I called his name into the woods that he had called his own names into  --  " Christy ! Christy ! "  --  but no answerp 176came back , only my own calling turned back into my ears . I was by the river and so tired with all the weight of the birds . What would I ever do with them ? And then I knew . . . . I flung them into the river . No one would ever know . They went down , a flotilla of feathers , like a floating garden , like a wreath to the river drowned , for Otey , for Christy , for all of us . I washed in the river . And then I felt so light with all my burden and I lay down close to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with something , as forever after , in the air . Something called , something hovered , hard and real and whole as a soaring bird . 0 birdcursed , birdblessed , birddrenched . . . . He is all our Sin and all our Vision and all our searching calling back to us , claiming us . Just when I am free and clean and myself again I hear this voice , I know this hovering  --  in my ascensions like wings from a bough that I think are up and away from him I am only soaring up to him  --  he is my air , he receives me , I fly in him back to him . There is the river , over I must  --  across I 'll go . It was morning and a new , known world . I walked straight home and as I came through Bailey 's Pasture , stained with all my stains and feathers in my hair and clinging to my clothes , the wind blew the feathers from me over the pasture and the feathers fell on the bitterweeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and whittling . He did not even look up as I came through the gate and went into the house . In the housep 177Malley was sitting by the window and Granny was nowhere to be found . No one even seemed to know that I had ever been away , and Christy never mentioned it . We never went hunting again . Our winter was close and lay long and gray and leaflessahead . Something waited for me now  --  a world of magic and witchcraft in which there were secrets and dreams and fantasias , whirling in the glimmer of cominghope and hopelessness ( who has not seen the gizzard-likebirthmark on the luminous forehead of the moon ? ) , and all of us speaking to each other , apart and solitary in our buried selves . All December the moon had a birthmark on it like Mrs. Childers the crazy woman had . The coldest winter in anybody 's memory came to Charity . All day some days there was the wild and savagehowl of the wind loping round the house ; and at night in the sleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was in the shutters , swung like a ghost the tire swing and rattled the cisternwheel . Roma the cow got frozen in the ditch and Christy had to kill her . Granny sat below away from us in the cellar . Swimma was in Florida or somewhere ; and Christy sat gazing at the map of the world in the kitchen or putting , wordlessly and patiently , the little ship in the turpentinebottle . I was listening to what everybody was saying and to what the blinded girl with the lyre on top of the world was singing ; and our house was full of the breath of speech. p 178But our spring came and with it such thaws and such rains that there was the biggest flood in years and the river widened out even onto Bailey 's Pasture and was so close to the house that we could see upon it drowned wooden cows rolling like barrels , lily pads of chickens floating and little outhouses and wagonwheels . When the river finally shrank back to the bottomlands it had left in Bailey 's Pasture crawfishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silt and the bones of birds ; and it had taken back there with it bitterweeds and sawdust and go-to-sleep flowers and even the babybuggy that we had left in the pasture to be ruined by the worst winter. p 179Suddenly I was intouch with something , in the air . Something called , something hovered , hard and real and whole as a soaringbird. 0 Christy , our great lover ! Reach down your birdbloodied hand to me , you who decorated me with your garland of news , crowned me with your birdbays of love , blessed me with the flowers and the songs of our woods , hung me with the trappings of our woods to send me , wrought like a frieze with all this beauty , all this knowledge , alone away through my inevitable journeyaway from you , like a new bird , fledged by your birdridden hands , towards home ( 0 let me go ! ) to get there as I could and find my own and , for the first time , earned welcome , to learn the bitter parting that gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haunt me , bless me now who led me away , broke my seal of secrets , then left me  --  violated and ready again : pattern of all the journeys I would ever make , bird-enchanted , bird-shadowed , bird-tormented . . . For I am in those woods again where the dialogue of p 180our shared secrets once flew like birds from the trees of your mind to the trees of mine ( but there is a clearing ahead where the river turns and flows , cuts through the trees , shall I follow it ? ) where there seems and seemed to be no time , nor past nor future , where once I was lost for the first time away from the house and kin  --  homing ! How homing ? 0 home me ! Where . . . ?  --  and thought of all of them , back there , Granny and Aunty and Malley and all the rest .... Who am I , separated from all of them and from home , yet with the idea of them and the idea of home in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked , sent somewhere ? Those who will ever see me naked will find upon my thigh the blue sign , the stigma but no blemish , really lovely , like a vein in an agate or the grain in wood  --  and they will know the touch of the birds upon me . There is the river , over I must  --  across I 'll go . For the vision burns away like cold blown breath ; and when I look again it will have vanished away . Christy make us real , make us hard and real in our lives : we who walk up and down in this autumn , trying to make ourselves real . We are involved , we are involved ; and we can not break away . All the history that we saw on the map in the kitchen pours into us and we contain it , we display it like a map for others to look at and be history ; and the song of the girl on the world sings through us to be sung into others : Go into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread love , go give , go make magnificence , get and give light , save and join and piece together ( as you did the bits ofp 181string and cloth and whittled wood to make your ship ) and show a whole and put it , combined and formed and shaped , into the world like a bottle with a ship in it . Gather the broken pieces , connect them : these are the only things we have to work with . For we have been given a broken world to live in  --  make like a map a world where all things are linked together and murmur through each other like a line of whispering people , like a chain of whispers a full clear statement , a singing , a round , strong , clear song of total meaning , a language within language , responding each to each forever in the memory of each man . And then I said , " I will get up now and go now , where I belong , and be what I must be . " I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and took it , and the next morning I knew it was no spell when I heard them calling all the names of the little forgotten towns , Normangee , Sweetwater , Cheetah , and I saw the live oak trees like old kinfolks in the fields . Then , after a while , I was in the road going to the house and looked up and there it was , on the little rising piece of land , waiting for me . Through the mist that lay between us it seemed that the house was built of the most fragile web of breath and I had blown it  --  and that with my breath I could blow it all away.
