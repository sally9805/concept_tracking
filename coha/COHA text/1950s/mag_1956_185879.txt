BUSINESSMEN IN FICTION <P> THAT 'S no ulcer . . . That 's rot-0the rot that works in the belly of all you big shots . " Thus , the hero of the latest novel about U.S. business , Company Man by John G. Burnett ( Harper ; $3.50 ) , castigates his spineless section chief for caving in to the pressure of office politics .

" <P> Adds Harvard Assistant Professor Kenneth S. Lynn , writing in the Harvard Business Review : " The lament that businessmen are treated with universal hostility has become less valid with the passage of time . " <P> Though the current crop of novels and plays may not be right on target , Lynn argues that authors approach their task with an inquiring and often sympathetic mind . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is aimed at the funny bone rather than the jugular . As General Bullmoose , a tycoon 's tycoon , says wistfully in the new musical comedy Li'l Abner : " Ever since I was a child , I had a dream . And all that simple child wanted was to get his hands on all the money in the world before the Greatest Broker of them all called him to that big Stock Market in the Sky . ' '
