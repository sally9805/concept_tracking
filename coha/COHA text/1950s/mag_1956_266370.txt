The 70,000 students who live and work in Paris ' Latin Quarter have long been famed for their individualism . They take pride in it ; as a tourist attraction and source material for novels , they consider themselves one of France 's national assets . Outsiders have long accepted their eccentricities and ascribed them simply to bohemianism . A young man or woman who lived in a fifth-floor garret , dressed like a Basque fisherman and sported an outrageous hairdo , was expected to be glamorously undernourished and suspected of harboring tuberculosis . But otherwise their elders were more worried about their morals than their health . Now , it seems , the diagnosis must be changed : far too many of the students of Paris are mentally sick . <P> " Statistically , TB is at the top of the students ' health problems , " says Dr. Daniel Douady , the government 's director of school and university health , " but who knows how many mentally ill are walking about ? In a few years mental illness will clearly be problem No. 1-if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the National Mutual of the Students of France : " Three-quarters of the students who consult our doctors complain of anxiety , though they usually do n't know precisely what the trouble is . And of the remaining 25% , many get social security benefits for other complaints , but their real trouble is mental . " <P> Les petits mentaux often become les grands mentaux at exam time . By U.S. or any other standards , French exams are among the world 's most exacting . Many students suffer " exam collapse " and ( in extreme cases ) " exam psychosis . " Although students who flunk can try again a half-year later , they see a first failure as a personal humiliation . To an alarming extent , students use stimulating drugs to keep themselves going through their final swotting : sales of Maxiton ( an amphetamine ) zoom from 10,000 boxes a month to 120,000 during the May-July exam season and university authorities have issued posters in an attempt to discourage the practice ( see cut ) . <P> To care for mentally ailing students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boul ' Mich ' , " a dentist 's office is a psychological consultation center after hours ( Saturday afternoon and after 6 p.m. on weekdays ) . Manned mainly by psychiatrists-who are called psychologists to avoid upsetting students who can not face the reality of their condition-it dealt with 72 patients in May , still had 36 last week although vacations were beginning . Six miles from the city 's center , at Sceaux , is a 15-bed university home for more serious but still " benign " cases . Last week it was full to capacity , with eight men and seven women suffering from " anguish neuroses , " adaptation difficulties , depression , and exam paralysis . A second home , with 50 beds , is scheduled to open in January . But the need will still be far in excess of supply .
