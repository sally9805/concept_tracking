A schoolteacher with a twelve-year-old boy in tow appeared last week at the University of Vienna 's Psychiatric Clinic and told its chief . Dr. Hans Hoff : " If you do n't take this child . I 'm going to quit my job . He has threatened suicide , and I refuse to take the responsibility . ' ' Dr. Hoff agreed to treat the youngster and his problems , but he had charge of only one of many cases that have recently alarmed Vienna 's teachers , public and press . In four months , 16 children aged 9 to 16 have tried to commit suicide in Vienna , and one of them , a boy of 13 who jumped from a third-story window , succeeded . <P> All the cases of threatened and attempted suicide by juveniles had one feature in common : they seemed to have been triggered by failure in school . The press charged that teachers were being tough and unsympathetic . The teachers retorted that the press , by blowing up the reported cases into an epidemic , had made suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point : a lad of 15 threatened suicide unless his marks were raised ; when the teacher refused , the boy slashed his wrists ( but survived ) . <P> Dr. Hoff decided to try to put the whole matter in perspective . Last week he lectured school authorities and teachers ( and through them , the press and parents ) on " Youth in Crisis . " In the first place , he said , this is no suicidal epidemic among Viennese youth-there are not many more attempts than usual , and the rate is little higher than in most of Western Europe . <P> Dr. Hoff laid down these principles as governing children 's attempts at suicide : <P> They result from a feeling of being insecure and unloved . <P> They are of long standing and begin in the home , years before the child gets to worrying about school marks . The school alone is never responsible . <P> A parent who makes good marks a prerequisite for loving acceptance sets the stage , and a teacher who then shows lack of feeling in handling a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . But in nearly every case , the child has been conditioned by a previous suicide in the family , or by newspaper stories making the attempt seem heroic . <P> Teachers , said Dr. Hoff , should keep in closer touch with parents about their pupils ' problems . And they should have better training in detecting the neurotic symptoms which most commonly lead to suicide attempts-especially excessive daydreaming , sudden drops in grades , and social withdrawal from teachers and class mates . Dr. Hoff gave one final warning : teachers must not underestimate the seriousness of children who use suicide threats as a form of blackmail . " They do not do it for a joke , " he said , " but because they are in need of something . "
