Luther Eustis , a sternly God-fearing farmer of middle age , had confessed the murder of Beulah Ross , the sexy teenager who ran away with him for an illicit two-week idyll . But when Parker Nowell took Farmer Eustis ' case , that changed matters a bit . Lawyer Nowell was a sour misogynist but he was also a brilliant courtroom tactician who " never took a case unless it was hopeless , and it was a long way from hopeless " when he did . <P> This taut little novel takes a sharp look at one of the oldest problems in literature : the origins and consequences of a crime of passion . Like Theodore Dreiser in An American Tragedy , though on a far more modest scale , Novelist Foote has tried to find out and explain why a peaceable , inoffensive man can sometimes be driven to murder . He has set his story in his native Mississippi among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " That Little Gold Chain .

His was a life dominated by gnawing fears and nagging frustrations . As a child , Luther had watched his father destroy himself after learning of his wife 's infidelity . As a man , he had found joy neither in his scraggly wife nor his children , one of them an idiot . Only in revivalist religion did he find any outlet for his cramped , unexercised emotions . <P> And then Eustis met saucy Beulah , who " was like the wicked ones the Prophets roared against : wore her clothes the way they did , and had that little gold chain on her ankle ; walked the way they must have done , hip bones loose in their sockets , the bottom part of her stomach held well forward . . .

Beulah had never known that love could mean happiness . For her it was only the assortment of men-big or little , decent or nasty-that her mother picked up . But nevertheless she thought her mother was kind : " For one thing , she only turned the nicest ones over to me , the businessmen . " <P> " I Have to Go Back . " For their first few days together , Beulah and Luther found in each other everything both had missed in life . But then the farmer began to read his Bible again and to see visions of his wife and children . " I have to go back , " he said . When Beulah refused to let him go , Eustis killed her . <P> Spinning out his story in a series of flashback monologues , Novelist Foote has a keen eye for the drama of a small-town courtroom in the South and an unmistakable talent for reporting the impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that keeps him from writing a really first-class novel is an unfortunate tendency to borrow overmuch from the verbal mannerisms of Neighbor William Faulkner .
