In Cook County Jail last week languished Alma Fergerson , 52 , whom the tabloid Chicago Sun-Times labeled " prisoner of love . " In 1949 she met Roy Fergerson ; he was already married , but they moved in together anyway . Mrs. Theresa Fergerson won a divorce on grounds of cruelty without naming Alma as corespondent , then sued her for alienation of affections* and last year won a $25,000 judgment . " We have n't got $25,000 , " said Fergerson , a trucking supervisor , who had married Alma by then . But the first Mrs. Fergerson had other means open to exact payment for her lost love . <P> In Illinois , a defendant who loses a tort suit and does not pay the damages can be jailed if " malice is the gist of the action . " And as charged in Theresa 's suit , Alma " maliciously " alienated Roy Fergerson 's affections . She could thus be jailed at the wronged woman 's discretion , and last week she was . Willingly , the first Mrs. Fergerson paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.50 weekly . " This whole thing is silly , " wailed Alma , who can be kept in jail for six months .

" <P> <P> * In 1935 , when " heart balm " was a headline phrase , the Illinois legislature passed a law forbidding damage suits for breach of promise or alienation of affections . In 1946 , however , the Illinois Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional , saying that it " tends to put a premium on the violation of moral law , making those who violate the law a privileged class , free to pursue a course of conduct without fear of punishment , even to the extent of a suit for damages .
