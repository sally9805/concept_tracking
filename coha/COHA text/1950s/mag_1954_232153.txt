Arbenz is out . This week Guatemala , after four years of skidding toward the Soviet orbit and ten days of bombing and strafing by anti-Communist rebel invaders , found its President 's Marxism and his Communist kibitzers too much . Top army officers forced him to quit , and took power with a junta of three colonels . <P> Arbenz flew off to exile in Buenos Aires . <P> The military assault that led to Colonel Arbenz ' downfall was hardly a firecracker pop by modern standards . It consisted mainly of a miniature air war , waged by four obsolete rebel planes ( see below ) . <P> They worked so effectively that the 2,000 tons of Communist infantry weapons that Arbenz imported last month were worthless-and he had no fighter planes of his own . As fear and tension grew in Guatemala , it became plain that the Communist jig was up . <P> By Sunday morning of this week there were plain signs of defection in the army and the cabinet . Foreign Minister Guillermo Toriello called in U.S. Ambassador John Peurifoy , sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peurifoy 's diplomatic answer was that he would certainly like to see the bloodshed end . He was barely back at his embassy when the phone rang again . It was Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz , chief of the armed forces . <P> Would the Ambassador come to his house for an urgent conference ? Farewell Address . Through deserted , shuttered streets went Peurifoy . Five top-ranking colonels were there , and they wanted to know whether the U.S. Ambassador would recognize a junta headed by Diaz , and help stop the fighting . What Peurifoy had to say , in the 2-hour talk , was not reported . But at the end Diaz and two other officers went to give Arbenz the word . The President , forced to bow for the first time in his stubborn life , burst into a rage , stormed and argued . Finally he acceded , and went on the radio for a bitter farewell in an unsteady voice breaking with emotion . <P> " I have made the momentous decision , " he said , " to abandon the presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I urge all revolutionary organizations to support him . I hope this decision will save the revolution . " <P> Doctrinaire to the end , he charged that the United Fruit Co. of Boston ( which lost 400,000 acres of land to Arbenz ' agrarian reform program ) had " tried to destroy our country " under the pretext of attacking Communism . He referred sorrowfully to the " overwhelming and tremendous means at the command of Guatemala 's enemies . " and signed off .
