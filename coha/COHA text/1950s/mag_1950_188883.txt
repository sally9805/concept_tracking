In the early months of 1949 , in the mid-continent city of Indianapolis , Mrs. Irene Horn , a housewife , felt frightened of the future . She " just had a sort of fear . " The fear was so great that she was saving every nickel , buying only bare necessities , and praying for prices to come down . By year 's end , Mrs. Horn 's fears had vanished . She and her husband had bought a farm in Ohio , and the future looked rosy . As she looked out over her 30 acres , her well-filled bins and fat cattle , she said : " I think things are pretty steady now . " <P> In capsule , that was the story of the whole U.S. economy in 1949 . As the year began , the nation too " just had a sort of fear . " The greatest boom in history was over the crest , and U.S. business had begun the perilous , booby-trapped road back to what it hoped would be " normalcy . " The journey was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayfaring nation started in the Slough of Dispond , went through Vanity Fair , passed the lion-guarded House Beautiful , profited from the counselings of Prudence , stumbled on the Hill called Difficulty , defeated Apollyon , a fiend , saw through the hollow words of Mr. Worldly Wiseman , encountered the contradictory Works of the Law , viewed the Delectable Mountains , encountered the doubletalk of Mr. By-ends of Fair-speech , and finally came to the Hill called Clear . But nowhere did anyone find Normalcy . <P> Slough of Dispond . The year began in an air of political unreality . The Administration gabbled of plans for new controls to fight an inflation that was already ebbing . With hard words for business , which was charged with failing to live up to its promise to lick inflation by production , President Truman talked of Government-financed steel plants , demanded $4 billion more in taxes and stand-by controls . Before long , he knew that he was wrong . <P> The steel industry caught up with the last great materials shortage and began closing down marginal mills .

The Federal Reserve Board index of industrial production , which had reached a postwar high of 195 in November 1948 , began to drop . <P> In January it stood at 191 , in February at 189 , and from March through June fell an ominous 3% a month . Not even at the start of the ' 29 depression had industrial production taken such a dismaying tumble . Even the prophets of doom , who had feared &; forecast a recession for four long years , had hardly expected such a change from boom to something that looked suspiciously like bust . <P> In June , the falling stock market , with $3.5 billion in paper values wiped out in three months , had its worst bear-shaking and hit its lowest point since 1945 . There was reason for pessimism . By July , unemployment , said the Administration , had almost doubled and stood at 4,000,000 , the highest in seven years .
