The President headed west from Washington on his 5,284-mile congressional-election tour in such a cheerful , eupeptic and thoroughly nonpolitical mood that one reporter called it a " Give ' Em Hello Campaign . " His first stop : the National Corn Picking Contest on the 400-acre Lumir Dostal Farm , ten miles northeast of Cedar Rapids , Iowa . There he stood up before a sea of 85,000 or more farmers , a tremendous forum for a campaign opener , got off to a sharp start when he proclaimed that realized net farm income was up 20% over last year and per-capita farm income was the highest ever . <P> But the President , for reasons unexplained , had billed this part of his tour " nonpolitical . " He neither replied to Massachusetts Democrat Jack Kennedy 's needling of Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson ( from the same platform just an hour before ) , nor appealed for votes for Republican Congressmen , nor even said a ringing word on behalf of Iowa 's G.O.P. gubernatorial candidate William G. Murray , Iowa State University agriculture-economics professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herschel Loveless . Instead , Ike threw in a statement from hastily jotted notes on foreign policy : " You can not bargain or negotiate in a world that is torn by dissension except from a position of strength . " That stirred interest . But in general , Ike 's reception was unenthusiastic. * <P> " If I Can Live . . . " When the President flew on to Salina , Kans. , then drove with Mamie in his bubbletop limousine 24 miles through sizable , friendlier crowds to home town Abilene ( first visit in four years ) , he showed much more of his famous , warm , arms-up humanity . In Abilene , in the small white frame house in which he and his brothers grew up , Ike happily showed Mamie how the family had used an old cradlelike dough tray in baking bread . <P> Visiting Abilene 's Eisenhower Museum , he spotted Army Nurse Major Florence Judd , who had looked after him following his ileitis operation in 1956 . He recalled without being reminded that she had been transferred from Washington to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had worked with Ike hauling ice at Belle Springs Creamery , came up , told Ike how well he looked . The President wagged his head and said , " If I can live two more years . . . " , let his voice trail off . Said Abe Forney : " You will , Ike . "
