txt A hunch that paid off was the way Sig Johnson tonight described his rescue of Mary Ann Church , 4 , one of a trio of youngsters lost Saturday in a blizzard in the snow packed Nicolet national forest . Johnson , 40 , who operates a roadside tavern a mile north of this village in the heart of the forest , found Mary Ann alive and her companions  --  her sister , Cathy , 5 , and her cousin , Steven Kennedy , 5 ? dead at a boarded up summer resort on desolate Gillett lake , five - miles southeast of here . Call Survival a Miracle At a hospital in Oconto Falls , 35 miles south of Lakewood , physicians said tonight that Mary Ann probably will recover from the ordeal of 43 hours  --  two nights , one day , and part of another day ? in one of the most severe storms of the season . They called her survival a miracle of the north woods . How Mary Ann managed to survive  --  with temperatures in the low 20s , winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which piled a fall of 10 inches on top of old snow several feet deep  --  may al , ways remain a mystery . But there was no mystery about her rescue . It was a. result of clear headed logic by Johnson  --  logic he called a hunch . Johnson was one of more than 700 men who spent yesterday 's daylight hours tramping thru the forest searching for the children . He was one of about 300 who continued the search today despite general conviction the children could no longer be alive . Draws a Line to Spot " I figured it this way , " he told Thu TRIBUNE tonight . " Those kids had to travel with the storm . They never could have faced the wind , so they must have walked with it . " I knew they could n't be within a mite of their home . We had gone over the ground within a radius of a mile so closely that there was n't square foot of it that had n't been examined . " Others said they could n't possibly have walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured they must have done so . I got out a map this morning , charted the wind direction on it and drew a line southeast from their home . The line hit Gillett lake , two miles away : " ' They never could have got that far , ' I told myself , but I decided it was as good a place to start looking as any . I decided to go there and start working back thru the woods . " Sees Tracks In Snow Johnson said he put his snow shoes into his car and started driving . By a circuitous route over seldom used rural roads opened to a single trail by a snow plow yesterday , Johnson drove first to Maiden lake , then two miles farther to Gillett lake . " I knew the Badger club Was . ? V .. back in there by the lake shore , closed for the winter but it was the only shelter anywhere in the vicinity , " he said . " I decided to start out from there . I put on my snow shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the buildings " The Badger club is a privately owned summer resort comprising a main lodge End half aliezen cottages . " Then I saw it , " Johnson said . " Tracks in the snow . Tracks of little feet . I shouted . I started to run . I tripped on my snowshoes , ot up and kept running . Both Face Down on Floor " I came to within 100 feet of an out house . Tracks led out from it down to the lake- The same tracks came back and wandered away again toward one of the cottages . I followed them with my eyes and there was Mary Ann sitting on the porch of the cottage . " Johnson had to discard his snowshoes before he could climb the porch steps . He ' caught up the girl in his arms . " She was cold and scared , " he said , " but she smiled at me . ? I asked her , ' Where 's Stevie ? ' and she answered , ' He 's sleeping . ' " Johnson carried Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door was open , " he said . " The floor was covered with snow . There were the other two tykes , face down on the floor , their faces in the snow . I knew then there was nothing I could do for them . " Drives to Parents ' Home Johnson wrapped Mary Ann in his coat , replaced his snowshoes and trekked back to his car , holding the girl in his arms . " She told me , ' Do n't run , ' " he said . Johnson drove at once to the home of Mary Ann 's parents , Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Church on state highway 32 , four miles south of here . The Church home had been headquarters for the search for two days . Scores of men were milling around the highway in front of the place . Sherif Joe Fora ! sat in a radio car directing the hunt . " I 've got one of them , " Johnson announced . Mary Ann was carried into her home to the arms of her mother . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads grimly . Her sister , Mrs. George Phillips , mother of Steven , collapsed . Believe Others Shielded Her A sherif 's car sped south on highway 32 with Mrs. Church and Mary Ann seeking a physician . They found Dr. J. S. Dougherty in his office in the village of Suring , 15 miles south . He administered first aid but advised immediate hospitalization . Johnson and Sherif Foral returned to Gillett lake and picked up the bodies . The boy had been dead several hours  --  perhaps since nightfall yesterday , the sherif said , but the girl had apparently lived up to three or four hours before . " Mary Ann must have slept between the two older children . " the sherif said , " They must have shielded her with their bodies . " The three children disappeared from the Church home about 3 p. m . Saturday when they ran out of the house to chase a porcupine they had seen from a window .

Bloodhounds Find Tassel Mrs. Church went to look for the children as soon as she noticed the snow . Thruout the night in a continuing snowfall , Sherif Fm-al and scores of volunteers tramped thru the woods . On Sunday the search party grew to more than 700 . Bloodhounds brought from Appleton found a tassel from Cathy 's hood on a bridge railing over a creek a few hundred yards north of the home . " We had fun playing by the creek , Mommy . " Mary Ann said from her hospital bed . The youngster was unable to give a coherent account of her ordeal , however , and was ' apparently lacking all sense of time and direction . " We walked and walked , " she said . Ironically , a county snow plow , opening the road between Gillett and Maiden lakes , passed within a few ht , ndred yards of their shelter yesterday afternoon when all were probably still alive , it was said .

Her face and hands were less seriously frostbitten but were scratched in many places . The children were dressed almost identically in wool jackets , denim coveralls , overshoes , and hoods.
