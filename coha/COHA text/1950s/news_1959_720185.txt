txt On page 15 of his.Budget Message President Eisenhower called upon Congress , . as part of the program for aid to the under-developed nations , " to enact legislation to expand the mutual security guarantee program . " On page 52 , in a discussion of the housing situation , he declared : " The Government is underwriting private credit for a substantial share of all houses built and purchased * * * . The emergency housing legislation already recommended to Congress would increase the exicting limitations on Government mortgage insurance by $6 billion * * * . I urge that the limitation be completely removed * * * so that this self-supporting program will be available at all times to insure adequate financing of housing . " These are but two examples of the way in which a new type of " invisible budget " has been growing up around the visible Administration budget , and growing recently at an accelerating rate . One of the chief objections raised against the now departed Reconstruction Finance Corporation was its practice of underwriting ' ea r .. k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government has a score of credit programs that rest in part at least on this highly dubious arrangement whereby the Government can stimulate the private economy by encouraging the expansion of private debt through guarantees or insurance , and little if any of the spending shows up in the budget at all . While it is not stressed in the Budget Message , the Supplementary Tables and Explanatory Analyses contained in the budget proper devote nineteen pages to the history and present ramifications of this practice , which this section notes " makes important contributions to the achievement of public policy objectives . " It goes on to observe : " The impact of Federal credit programs on the Federal budget is relatively small when compared with the large amount of credit extended or guaranteed . The most important reason is the predominance of Federal guarantees and insurance of private loans in recent years . " To many persons the vastly increased reliance on this method of " achieving public policy objectives " will probably come as something of a shock . But according to the figures contained in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 billion in 1945 to $18 billion at the end of fiscal 1958 , private loans , partly or wholly guaranteed by Federal agencies , have increased nearly tenfold since 1945 . This would suggest that they had risen in a little over a decade from approximately $6 billion to over $58 billion . We used the word " accelerating " in referring to the growth of this mechanism for encouraging the creation of debt-making outside the budget . Guarantees and insurance in effect are estimated to increase to $82.3 billion by the end of 1960 . That would be an increase of about $24 billion since the end of 1958 . The net authority for such underwriting of private loans will amount , at the end of 1960 , to $103.8 billion . The total of such debt guarantees estimated to be outstanding at the end of 1960 , $82.3 billion , would represent 17 per cent of the nation 's total private debt at the end of 1958 ; the authority to stimulate the creation of private loans , $103.8 billion , would represent approximately 22 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
