Inflation and Recessions THE PRESIDENT , whose diet is carefully regulated , is convinced that our economy would be healthier if the federal government consumed less . Would it ? Has it not been demonstrated that what is good for the private person ( or General Motors ) is not necessarily good for the country ? The United States is still growing rapidly , both in its capacity to produce and in the demands made upon that capacity here and abroad . Should we starve that growth , thus depriving not only ourselves but others whose needs and dangers are greater than ours ? Mr. Eisenhower and his advisers fear inflation . And well they might . But in their preoccupation with " promiscuous spending , " are they not disregarding the most relevant question , which is : how much of what shall the US produce , from whom , and how shall the costs be met ? It is with this question in mind that we read the remarks last week of Dr. Arthur F. Burns , former chairman of the President 's Council of Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education was modestly titled " Some Lessons of the Recent Recession , " and because it is a speech to which reference will be made for a long time to come and since it was so poorly reported by the daily press , a summary is in order . After reviewing what happened to the American economy after it began to slip in mid-1957 , Dr. Burns notes that this recession differed outstandingly from the classical models in that there was relative stability of personal incomes after taxes : Income fell only about one percent , while production fell by six percent . Consumer buying was thus sustained , and " this loosening of the ties between production and the flow of personal incomes is one of the most significant and promising developments of our time . He then turns to the ways in which federal power was used to combat the decline under the Full Employment Act : In the area of monetary and fiscal policy there was an easing of credit through changes in reserve requirements and the discount rates ; housing credit was liberalized ; the processing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax adjustments were made to aid railroads and small business . At the same time , consumer purchasing power was supported by extending unemployment benefits . But , as between a broad tax cut and increased federal spending ( some of the increase being involuntary ) the President and Congress relied on public works ? defense , housing , education , post offices . And the decisions in these cases , Dr. Burns notes , " were not all taken at once . . . . When scheduled expenditures were finally added up , they came to a much larger total than had been planned or advocated by the fiscal authorities of our government . . . . Most federal expenditures . . . did not become effective soon enough to be of any appreciable aid during the recession . On the other hand , in the current fiscal year , which began . . . about two months THE NEW REPUBLIC after the start of recovery , federal budget expenditures are expected to rise $7.3 billion or 10 percent over a year ago . . . . A sharply rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is precisely the condition that responsible advocates of a general tax cut sought to prevent . " Recession or not , Dr. Burns reminds us , prices go up . " Indeed , " he says , " during the recent recession , the level of wholesale prices actually rose one percent , while the level of consumer prices rose a little over two percent . Wages have likewise been unresponsive to recessions . . ? . The movement of wages and prices . . . constituted new evidence that while there may well be pauses in the process of inflation as in the last few months , the underlying trend of the price level is still upward . " Moreover , " we have even less reason than before to expect that any substantial part of the advance in the price level which normally occurs during business expansion will be erased during business recessions . " Looking ahead , what does Dr. Burns think ought to be done to minimize the harm of future recessions ? ? Automatic stabilizers worked well this time : The unemployment compensation system should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . 110- An overhaul of our tax system is needed , " in a calmer atmosphere than existed early this year . . . . Our situation would be better still if we could devise a politically acceptable means of automatically varying tax rates with the ups and downs of economic activity . " 111 , - Monetary and credit policies can be more effective : " If .. . a substantial easing of credit conditions comes early enough , it may appreciably hasten economic recovery . " NoSince government expenditures on public works lag behind the decisions to make such expenditures , things which are done " to check recession have consequences which , for better or worse , spill over into later periods . Thus the federal spending programs inaugurated during the recession , taken together with the recent behavior of wages and prices , have been a major factor in exciting expectations of inflation which are now spreading dangerously . " As between a public works program and a tax reduction , viewed as anti-recession measures , " both involve . . . a deficit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deficit is achieved . A broadly based tax reduction is likely to have prompt effects on private spending during a recession , while the effects of public spending may not come until the recession is over . " ( This was the point at issue in The New Republic 's disagreement with Senator Neuberger on the question of tax cuts in the spring of ' 57 . ) If the public is to learn from what has happened , it ought , Dr. Burns suggests , to reappraise a. wide range of policies : fiscal and monetary ; the patchwork of legislative props ? farm price supports , stockpiling , wage regulations ; monopolies ? whether business or labor ; the relating of taxes and government expenditures to the business cycle . He offers , finally , two recommendations aimed at enlarging our understanding of inflation : the setting up of area productivity councils throughout the country , and , amending " the Employment Act so that reasonable stability of the consumer price level will be explicitly included among the high objectives which it is the continuing policy and responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable proposals. - But the dilemma persists . Public expenditures ? whatever Mr. Eisenhower wishes ? are not going to decline any more than the price level is going to decline . If Dr. Burns has his wish and the public becomes more conscious of the dangers of inflation , how will the public respond ? Will it spend less on personal comforts ? That seems unlikely . Will it deny itself schools , roads , urban renewal , medical care ? Not for long . Will it neglect the national defense or foreign economic obligations ? We trust not . Can the public then ? fearful of inflation ? be given a taste for higher taxes ? That , like the basic question of what we produce for , is a political question , and Dr. Burns would have every right to plead incompetence . Why Not All Berlin ? x-HRUSHCHEV kindly gives the US , Britain and France six months to get out of West Berlin , or .... Or what ? Or he will get out of East Berlin , leaving its administration to his servants . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does sometimes repeat itself , when it does so , what first occurs as tragedy appears the second time as farce . It may be going a little too far to apply this saying to Soviet threats to the four-power status of Berlin . But one may say that the Russian ultimatum is anything but die Blumen of peaceful coexistence , and that the Soviet " case " vanishes when exposed to the light of history . The West , Khrushchev charges , violated the Potsdam accord by remilitarizing West Germany . But four years before the West German soldier was in uniform ? in the fall of 1948 ? military units in East Germany were formed . And before that , while Western forces in Germany had been reduced to constabulary units for the purpose of maintaining local security , the Russians had established an army of 20 divisions in East Germany ; and 22 Soviet divisions are there today ! Nazism , Khrushchev claims , was eradicated in the Soviet Zone . True enough . Nazis were eliminated by the simple expedient of incorporating them as activists in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1958 which Khrushchev now finds menacing ? was solidified when the Russians seized political control of their sector and then forced the government of greater Berlin out of the Russian sector in an effort to take over all control . That is the background against which to view the new Soviet proposal for a " free " West Berlin ? free of foreign troops , free of interference from East or West , free to be " capitalist " : a free island , free to go under . " Spontaneous rallies will be held , " a West Berlin newspaper realistically prophesies , " red flags will appear . There will be brawls ? and then someone calls for the Peoples ' Police . They will come to maintain peace and order . And the police will stay . " Again , Khrushchev prods our governments to produce alternatives . The alternatives are available . A four-power meeting on Germany is another opportunity to negotiate the reunification of Germany , and if the price for a united , democratic Germany is a Germany deprived of nuclear weapons , surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the US . Meanwhile , the Western governments need not delay their reply to Khrushchev 's immediate proposal . Let all Berlin , not just West Berlin , become a free city . Let it be understood that this free city is to be the capital of a united Germany , and that nothing in any agreement shall prejudice that ultimate reunification . Until Germany is united , Berlin 's security should be guaranteed by the four occupying powers , each retaining a number of troops in the city for that purpose . The proposal might be made more attractive by suggesting that the number of troops be reduced from their present number . It might also be proposed that the United Nations exercise surveillance over the administration of free Berlin , and that no steps would be taken by any of the four powers to alter existing political or economic arrangements within the city . But it would be explicitly agreed that within a stated period free elections would be held in the city to set up a new government for all Berlin . Military Aid Study THE PRESIDENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign aid program is an attempt to resolve an argument between the Pentagon and the State Department . Secretary Dulles has said that the Committee is " in part at least " a response to the August 25 letter to the President in which eight members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee pointed to a serious distortion in the present relative importance which is attached to military and related aid on the one hand and . .. economic development assistance on the other . " But the President was also responding to the demand by Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs C. Douglas Dillon for greatly expanded economic aid funds . Some say that the President himself now inA LETTER TO LEON KEYSERLING ? ? ? November 23 , 1958 DEAR LEON , I have read the fascinating " egghead " articles in The New Republic . Of course , I am mostly on your side of the discussion . In other words , I prefer the donkey to the chicken . Although discussions of the relative merits of eggheads and practical politicians in government should be conducted ? as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private opinion is that the problem is to get the right mixture in the carburetor ? if I may be permitted to make an omelet out of these assorted metaphors . I am for a Congress which contains a reasonable number of eggheads , as well as a large majority of " non-intellectuals . " I have the same firm view with respect to the general staff of each Executive Agency . I do n't particularly like soft-boiled eggheads and think they should be served only on the well-browned toast of operational politicians . Of course , the ideal is a hard-boiled egghead , like you . But there are n't many in that category , because few eggheads have been boiled long enough in the hot water of practical politics . And a lot of eggheads who have been boiled for the requisite period of time lose their egginess . Another problem we eggheads face is the very difficult one of avoiding excessive eggocentricity or eggomania . On the whole , however , I see more promise in eggheads than in non-eggheads , even though a diet composed exclusively or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the American people , pretty sick . But I confess that I have a personal preference for individual eggheads because of their high energy-giving quality . By the way , who first committed the outrageous crime of blandly assuming that Tom Finletter is an egghead ? Who tossed the first egg at that fine fellow ? I suspect that this is slander , just as it would be slanderous to say that your former chief , Senator Wagner , was not an egghead . ABE FORTAS Washington , D.C. dines to the Dillon view and expects the Draper Committee to provide support for a reduction of military aid levels in the new mutual security budget request or for a budget big enough to accommodate both more economic aid and a continuation of present military aid . One can place some , but not too much , hope in the Draper Committee . Chairman William H. Draper jr . is himself a man of breadth who in the past has put his weight behind liberal trade policies . He has repeatedly emphasized the need for more private investment abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions before his Committee . The President refers in the opening paragraph of his letter of transmittal to Draper to a review of our military aid programs ; but he goes on to ask for a broad appraisal of " the relative emphasis which should be given to military and economic programs , " in the light of " the impact of present and anticipated weapons developments . " How much and in what direction will the committee 's judgment on this question be influenced by strong-minded spokesmen for military interests ( the nine members include Admiral Arthur Radford and Generals Gruenther and McNarney ) ? And how will the committee view the requests of new military regimes in countries which have previously been given large amounts of US military assistance ? The President hopes the Draper report will be available by next March . But meanwhile , the US has recently become committed to sending another $115 million in military hardware to Pakistan , having previously delivered nearly $200 million . An aid program of such size is more dubious than ever : The rise of General Ayub Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is now entangled with any of his repressive measures inside Pakistan and is an inadvertent sponsor of his menacing attitude toward India . Yet how does the US disengage from obligations such as this which prove subversive of the total US position in Asia ? If the Draper Committee faces such questions boldly , if it appraises accurately the nature of the Communist economic and political threat and calls upon the country to meet that costly challenge , it will have performed a tremendous service . Treason in South Africa S OUTH AFR1CA 's treason trial , which began two years ago , still drags on . Speculation as to the fate of the 91 accused of opposing racial segregation ? following the sensational withdrawal of the indictment on October 13 ? ended recently when the Attorney-General announced that he will make a new attempt to obtain a conviction . But this time , only 31 of the accused will stand trial . Commencing January 19 , they will appear in the same Special Court in the Old Synagogue , Pretoria , before the same three judges . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of the original 156 arrested ) will be tried in April , an entirely new procedure in South African law . One of the accused , Alfred Hutchinson , grandson of a White man who married a Swazi woman , has disappeared over the border and is reported to be seeking asylum in Ghana . Shortly before he left the country Hutchinson was picked up by the police and charged for not having a pass . He was able to prove that he is colored ( i.e. mixed blood ) and not pure Negro , and therefore exempted from the pass laws . The Attorney-General 's decision to persist with the treason trial brings a bleak prospect for Christmas and the New Year for the accused and their families , who have already lived in uncertainty and insecurity for two years . While standing trial , the accused can not continue their normal occupations and most of them have lost all sources of income . Very few employers , even if they have casual employment to offer , will give it , for fear of incurring the displeasure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it can but legal costs , although at cut rates , devour considerable sums . The Fund has so far spent $225,000 ( $30,000 having been donated by Americans ) and estimates that as much again will be needed to see the case through . New Deck for France T HE RESULT of the French Parliamentary election has no precedent in the history of France since the Second Empire . It amounts so plainly and so crushingly to a personal victory for Charles de Gaulle that he probably could , if he chose , transform the so-called Fifth Republic into a Third Empire . But the General is not ? and does not want to be ? a Bonaparte . The personal vote of confidence he received reflects appreciation of his integrity after so many years of slackness , petty ambition , nest-feathering , log-rolling and downright corruption . It pays tribute to faith in his strength and his patriotism . It is also an endorsement of his preachment of glory and grandeur for France , but in a setting necessarily different from that of the good old days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of the Suez adventure . Few Americans realize the extent and intensity of popular support for that sorry expedition . From the phony war of 1939 and its shameful consequences in the last days of Vichy ; through Dien Bien Phu ; to the lone and horrid Algerian nightmare , the French have grovelled in one way or another . And the need for anything even obscurely resembling glory has grown irrationally . Precisely because Suez failed , the coup of the French military in Algeria last May 13 succeeded in mobilizing popular support : the theme was that this time the Army would run politics rather than vice versa . From the start , the dividing line in popular support between de Gaulle himself and the Gaullists was as fuzzy as that between the soldiers and the civilians . Both , however , profited from a general desire to get rid of the Fourth Republic because it had failed to get rid of the evils of the Third Republic . What was needed , the French thought , was not a New Deal ; it was a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a deck , the credit ? or as the time may prove , the blame ? must go to the new Gaullist machine created and organized largely by Jacques Soustelle . He and a few DECEMBER 8 , 1958 dozen others developed techniques of political salesmanship derived from Madison Avenue and from what young officers of the Army in Vietnam learned from the Chinese Communists about psychological warfare . Those few men of the Third Republic who survived the electoral holocaust had joined ( in some cases better late than never ) the retinue of de Gaulle . On the other hand , some of the best and truest supporters of the policies that had been best in de Gaulle himself before the May 13 Algerian coup were swept aside . The most obvious example is Pierre Mendes-France . The fact that careful advance manipulation of the constitution and laws gave the Communist Party , with the second largest vote , less than a dozen seats is less important than that Soustelle 's Union for the New Republic rolled up 188 seats of 465 from metropolitan France , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to support M. Soustelle . Also , the fact that Antoine Pinay 's " Independents " ? the classical conservatives ? did very well must be taken as indicating that what happened can not be explained entirely by the magic of one man , de Gaulle , or the machinations of another man , Soustelle . When one examines the returns in some of the districts of Paris in the first round of the election on November 23 , one finds that almost invariably when a left-wing Gaullist was running against a right-wing Gaullist , the man of the Right won . When a left-wing Gaullist was pitted against a non-Gaullist of the Right , the man of the Right won . Obviously , therefore , the trend seems at least as much conservative and Rightist as it is Gaullist . And this may turn out to be de Gaulle 's greatest problem . How far , one wonders , will the Gaullists follow de Gaulle on Algeria ? The mood of France , from what one can see immediately after the election , is probably more that of 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Poor W E PASS ON , with a sense of boundless wonder , the " following remarks attributed by Time ( Dec. 1 ) to Cardinal-designate Richard J. Cushing , Archbishop of Boston : When I was a boy living in a poor section , coming from hard-working people , it was unknown that the poor would not go to church . . . . Now , with social security checks and welfare checks coming in , they are not interested in the church . They go from day to day knowing that tomorrow will take care of itself . At this point , says Time , " Cushing clenched his big fists " and said : . Their former dependence on God , upon the personal charity of those representing religion , has been psychologically unsettled by the welfare state . Who Did the Packing ? 11 " OT since incriminating papers were hidden in a pumpkin have we been so teased as by the mystery of who packed Mr. Nixon 's bag and left out the dinner jacket ? " Not me , " said Pat , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband are " just as much in love as the first day " ; then why did n't she even check his bag ? Did n't she know they were going to see the Queen ? If she was too busy , who had the responsibility ? The lady 's maid ? Poor planning , indeed ; she had all she could do to remember the cloth coat . The valet , then . But who 's he ? Why has his name never been mentioned ? Why has n't he been questioned by the press , or by the police ? Who pays him ? Who cleared him ? Is he a valet ? Or did he too come out of a pumpkin ? We shall not rest until we know . Sartorial sabotage in high places can not be tolerated , and Mr. Nixon should be the first to demand a full Congressional inquiry . Unless , of course , he is his own valet ? King of the Castle CARMINE DESAPIO is king of the Bourbons , but the  - -  4 Bourbons were bested by Republicans in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders of the past . For if Governor Harriman , Mrs. Roosevelt , Senator Lehman , Thomas Finletter , Mayor Wagner were powerless at the time of the state nominating convention , how shall they take charge now , in defeat ? " If Nelson Rockefeller , " confides one New York Democrat , " performs at even 50 percent of the performance he put on during the campaign , he is going to be a great national leader . " The remark is a measure of Mr. Rockefeller 's prestige , and of the insecurity of the Democratic Party . With the exception of a few insurgent clubs , the Party organization in New York City ? such as it is ? belongs to DeSapio by default . Only two counties , Manhattan and Queens , have a direct primary for district leader and it is questionable whether , even there , the insurgents can lay a glove on the boss . Brooklyn , Richmond and the Bronx have no direct primaries ; and the Bronx machine is particularly powerful . Outside the city , in the suburbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not listened to . Upstate leadership is traditionally resentful Of the Big City , but it is generally conservative ; it will play ball with DeSapio ; it has neither the program nor the power to rescue the party . If he were to put his full strength into the battle , Mayor Wagner could rally the best elements among the Democrats . But if he does so , he will surprise his friends . The New York delegation to the Democratic National Convention of 1960 will , from all present evidence , be what it was in 1956 : a DeSapio delegation , leavened by a very few dissenters.
