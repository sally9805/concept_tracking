The play happens on the stage of an abandoned theatre on the lower East Side of New York , in the midst of a slum-clearing project . There are three makeshift bunks on the stage . On one of them lies a woman called the QUEEN , who coughs now and then in her sleep . A man called the DUKE comes in quietly , studies the face of the QUEEN , picks up a pile of manuscripts of old plays , dumps them in a corner , opens the top one and stands , looking at it . A series of explosions begin , one after another , to which he half-listens . A GIRL comes running down the stage alley to the stage door . She makes several unsuccessful attempts to open it , finally pushes it open , comes in , and runs to the farthest bunk , gets in , and pulls the covers over her head . The DUKE goes to the bunk in which the GIRL is hiding . After a moment , she puts her head out , looks around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . GIRL For the love of God , what was that ? DUKE All right , now . It 's only the wreckers . They 're knocking down the rotten old buildings around here . p. 3 GIRL ( Gets on her feet ) Oh . I did n't know where to run . ( Looks around ) Where am I ? DUKE This is an old theatre . Here , I 'll show you . This is the stage . There 's the orchestra pit , out there 's the auditorium , up there 's the balcony . Can you see ? GIRL Yes , now I can see all right . I 've never seen a theatre from the stage before . It makes me feel  --  well , kind of proud , I guess . I do n't know why , but it does . ( She stops suddenly and then speaks softly ) Well , I guess I 'd better go now . Thanks very much . DUKE That 's all right . GIRL ( Begins to go , stops , turns ) Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here ? No , this place is for us . The Queen over there , sick . The King . He 'll be back pretty soon . And me . I 'm the Duke . Just names , of course . The Queen used to be on the stage . The King used to be a clown  --  he was in vaudeville and he did Shakespeare , too  --  and I used to be in the ring . We 've been like a family almost a month now , and this is our home . GIRL Could it be my home , too ? p. 4 DUKE No , no , we 've got rules and regulations . There are other places for other people . GIRL Where are the other places ? DUKE All over . This is our place . We found it , and it 's a theatre . They 're going to knock it down pretty soon , but until they do we 've got our  --  ( Softly ) rules and regulations . GIRL What are the rules and regulations ? DUKE People of the theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre , too , because  --  well , the King says so . Besides , after I lost my title , I went on tour . This is n't the first time I 've been on the stage . It 's just the first time that I 've lived on one . GIRL Could n't I , too ? DUKE Are you an actress ? GIRL Oh , no . But I am tired and I 've got to find some place to stay . DUKE ( Looks over at the QUEEN , speaks softer ) Well , what have you done ? GIRL Well , I was at a place where they put guns together . DUKE What did you do there ? p. 5 GIRL I was on hammers . I never saw the whole gun . DUKE Real guns ? GIRL I do n't think so . The name of the place was U.S. Toy . DUKE Did the company ever put on entertainments ? GIRL Not while I was there . DUKE At school did you do anything ? GIRL ( Shakes head ) Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toy , too . DUKE Why ? GIRL I 've always been shy . And afraid , too . DUKE Afraid of what ? GIRL I do n't know . Everything , I guess , and  --  everybody . DUKE Are you afraid of me ? GIRL Well , no , but I am afraid I wo n't find a place to stay . DUKE Why do n't you go home ? GIRL I have n't got a home . ( Pause ) Can I ? Stay ? DUKE You 're young . This is no place for you . p. 6 GIRL Please do n't make me go away . I do n't know why , but I do n't feel so scared here . I kind of feel at home here . DUKE You 've got to be in the theatre . The King says so , and we all agreed . He believes in the theatre . It 's like a religion with him . So what am I going to tell him ? Here 's a scared girl ? No place to go ? GIRL Could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKE No , that 's not the same thing at all . But have n't you ever done anything in front of people to make them feel happy , or sad , or proud of themselves ? GIRL I remember a sidewalk game that used to make me happy . ( Pause ) One potato , two potato , three potato , four ! Five potato , six potato , seven potato more ! DUKE Anything else ? GIRL ( Stands stiffly , salutes ) I pledge allegiance to the Flag , and to the Republic for which it stands . One nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . DUKE ( Considers what he has heard ) Well , you 've been to the theatre . You 've seen what they do . Can you do anything like that ? p. 7 GIRL I never went to the theatre very much  --  too expensive . At U.S. Toy , though , I used to dream a lot , and it was kind of like stuff I 'd seen in the movies . One whole afternoon I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they fired me . They almost fired another girl first , but it was n't her . It was me . DUKE What were you dreaming about ? GIRL Oh . ( Pause , shyly ) I do n't know . DUKE Was it like a show on a stage ? GIRL I do n't think so , because it was only me . But I was different . I was beautiful . DUKE ( After thinking ) Well , I 'll tell the King you 're in the theatre . No harm in telling him , I guess . GIRL Will you ? DUKE Yes . In a way you are . At any rate , you 're here . And who knows ? Maybe he 'll believe us . GIRL Thank you . ( She seems anxious and afraid , as well as relieved ) DUKE When I was afraid just before a fight I used to jump up and down , like this . ( He demonstrates ) I always wanted to holler , too , but of course I could n't . They 'd think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't think he 's crazy . But if I 'd been able to holler just before my big fight , I 'd never have lost the crown . ( He looks up , whispers ) Help me . ( He shouts ) Help me ? ( The QUEEN sits up , shakes her head as if to see more clearly , watches ) It 's what I wanted to do . It 's what I should have done . It 's what I never did . What a fool I was . ( He sits down . The GIRL goes to him , reaches a hand out timidly , places it on his head , as a small hand on the head of a big sad dog . After a moment he looks up at her , stands ) About being in the theatre . Can you sing , for instance ? p. 8 GIRL ( Half sings ) How do you do , my partner . How do you do today ? DUKE Not bad . GIRL Will you dance in a circle , if I show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whoever you are ! p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene 2 A little later . The GIRL has tidied up the place . Both unoccupied bunks are made , the tatters and rags straightened and folded neatly . She is now sweeping the floor . The QUEEN watches , sits up , rests her head on her elbow . QUEEN Well , now , where is the King ? DUKE He 'll be here pretty soon . Just rest now , Queen . Sleep . QUEEN More sleep ? Sleep and sleep ? ( Shakes her head ) Remember this , Duke . And you , Girl . If I sleep and it 's time to eat , wake me . However deep my sleep may be . Lift me up out of my bed if need be . Stand beside me , one to the right and one to the left , and if I still sleep , walk with me , until I am awake again . Understand ? DUKE All right , now , do n't worry . We 'll wake you up . QUEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , you 'll get me up ? GIRL Yes , Queen . QUEEN A moment ago I spoke of something . What was it I spoke of a moment ago ? DUKE No need to remember what you spoke of . p. 10 QUEEN I said something . What did I say ? I remembered something and then I said something . ( Sleepily ) But now I ca n't remember any more . ( She falls back . The DUKE stands over her . Turns away , to the GIRL ) DUKE She 's asleep again . GIRL Should n't she have a doctor ? DUKE She 's old , that 's all . She 's been this way the whole month I 've been here . And then all of a sudden she 's up , and alive , and young and beautiful , too . There just is n't enough food that 's all . She ought to have more food . Better food . GIRL I wo n't eat . DUKE You 've got to eat . GIRL I 'll go away , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . ( The DUKE brings the manuscript out of his back pocket , begins to read it again . The GIRL continues to sweep.The KING comes in , an old , hard , lean man with a long lined face . He is in rags , and yet he moves in a kind of human grandeur . He carries a paper sack with a round loaf of bread in it . As he moves he seems to be deep in thought . The DUKE and the GIRL wait for him to notice them , but he is n't looking ) p. 11 KING Enough of violence . Enough , I say . Be done with it . Have done with it . DUKE ( Clears his throat to attract his attention ) King ? KING ( Turns , almost unseeing ) Yes ? What is it ? DUKE I looked for work all day . Any kind . They seem to be afraid of me , or something , that 's all . I looked for money in the streets , too . I got home a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence . DUKE What violence ? Where ? KING In  --  in  --  in each of us  --  crouched , waiting . In everything we do  --  and think , even . Enough of it . ( Softly ) Christ , how the people hate one another to pass the beggar as if he were n't there . To be deaf to his shameful words . A small coin for a great need . ( Soberly ) I 've begged all day , begged of my inferiors . DUKE I hope you 've had a little luck . KING This loaf of bread , old and hard , but bread , at any rate . ( Fishes into his pocket , comes up with a few coins , jingles them , opens his fist , looks at them ) These few sad coins . I 've begged before . Bad luck in the coins , but worse in the violence  --  theirs and my own . I 've already called them my inferiors . Perhaps they are n't . But if they are , there 's no need for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ( Notices the GIRL ) Who 's that standing there ? p. 12 DUKE She 's in the theatre , too , like ourselves . She speaks well , and has a pleasant singing voice . ( Gestures at the beds ) She 's a helpful girl . But she 's ready to go , if we do n't want her . KING Why should the girl go ? There 's a whole loaf of bread . ( Goes to the GIRL ) Welcome , Girl . And do n't be afraid of me . I saw no eyes all day that were not afraid , and the violence of it has hurt me again , deeper than ever . In the days gone I covered this face with white grease , and red  --  the clown 's mask . But this face is the mask , and the other is my true face . Welcome , and do not be afraid . ( The GIRL nods . He places the coins in her hand ) Here is the whole day 's gain . Buy something for the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . KING ( To the DUKE ) There were other gains . I saw a dog on a leash , held by a woman in furs . I swear that dog spoke to me with its eyes as clearly as if it had spoken with its breath and tongue and teeth and palate . Hey , beggar ! beggar ! I 'd give my soul to change places with you for only one turn of the world ! The woman in furs gave me nothing , not even the dirty look I 've come to count on , and even to cherish a little , since I am of the theatre , and live on being seen , even if hatefully . Any kind of a look is better than none at all . The words of the eyes of the small dog were a great gain , and another was a thought that came to me soon afterwards . A bitter thought , but a true one , and so I must pass it along . When I was rich  --  Girl , I have been rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stage , and came upon a beggar  --  old , twisted , deformed , ugly , dirty , better than half dead  --  ( Stretches out his arms slowly )  --  while I was a wit in the world , a maker of wild laughter and joyous sorrow among the multitudes , did I notice the beggar ? Did I see him , truly ? Did I understand him ? Did I love him ? Did I give him money ? ( Softly ) No , I did not . In my soul I said , Let him be dead and out of my way . That was a gain . Bitter , but a gain . Violence ! My own violence , come home ! p. 13 QUEEN Oh , stop your shouting . ( She sits on the bunk , as the GIRL watches ) KING Oh , you are awake , then ? QUEEN Wide awake . KING And there 's my bed . That makes a day . Up in the morning . Out to beg . Back in the evening . The table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to bed . ( Softly ) I love it too much . QUEEN Well , you 're home again , at any rate , and as you see , I 'm up again . There 's one good hour in me every day , still . One good queenly hour . ( To the GIRL ) I did them all , you know  --  Catharine , Mary , Ann , Bess , and all the others . A young girl from the most common of families , if in fact you could call it a family at all . A poor weary mother , a poor drunken father , a dirty houseful of dirty brothers and sisters . I sometimes marvel at the way I turned out . KING Turned out or turned in , the table 's ready , if you are . QUEEN I have never been readier , sir . KING Your arm then , Woman . ( He takes her by the arm , the DUKE and the GIRL watch , and then do the same ) p. 14 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The KING and the QUEEN are chewing the last of the bread . KING Well , that 's the end of the bread . QUEEN ( Brightly , almost gaily ) Yes , we 've eaten it all . KING Uptown the lights are on . The theatres are ready . The tickets are sold . The players are putting on their make-up and getting into their costumes . In a moment the curtains will go up , and one by one the plays will begin and The Great Good Friend out there  --  ( He gestures toward the auditorium )  --  will look and listen . And little by little something will stir in his soul and come to life-a smile , a memory , a reminder of an old forgotten truth , tender regret , kindness . In short , the secret of the theatre . GIRL ( Childlike ) What is the secret of the theatre ? QUEEN Love , of course . Without love , pain and failure are pain and failure , nothing else . But with love they are beauty and meaning themselves . GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave thee : for whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and where thou diest , will I die . p. 15 KING Bravo , you did that very well . QUEEN Oh , King , do a clown 's bit . A kingly clown 's bit . KING I belong uptown . I still do . I was born there , and then I was put out . QUEEN Are you an actor , or a sad old man like all the other sad old men ? I thought it was agreed . We are of the theatre . You are to perform , not to be performed upon . KING ( Puts a crumb in his mouth ) I 'm still eating . Would you have eating a performance , too ? QUEEN Would you have it something else ? Could it possibly be something else ? Do a bit about eating ! KING We just did that bit , did n't we ? ( He puts a crumb between his upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chomp ) QUEEN This time without bread . For its own dear sake . KING I am challenged , Woman . You know I would kill myself for art . QUEEN Or us  --  from the wonder of it . KING ( He gets up quickly ) The great man comes to the famous restaurant , hungry and hushed , and thoughtful , because he remembers when he was nobody and the world was still far-away . Now , he wears the unmistakable scowl of superiority , and so the arrogant head-waiter bows humbly , and conducts him quickly and silently to the best table in the place . However , before accepting the headwaiter 's offer to sit  --  ( He indicates the drawing-out of a chair )  --  he stands a moment to notice who else has come to the holy joint , and to be noticed by them . ( The QUEEN leans forward , delighted both with his work and her success in having provoked him into it ) But who is he ? ( Pause , extra clearly , now loud , now soft , inventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before his first flight to  --  ( Searches for an inept destination ) Dubrovnik ? The Spanish pianist from Palma of the Canary Islands ? The man who discovered the flaw in the theory of cycles ? He who invented the law of loss , or was it only the lollipop ? Or is he perhaps the man who learned the language of the Arab tribes , brought the warring chiefs together , engineered the business of the oil ? ( Slight pause ) Let them try to guess , it 's good for them . In any case , it 's time to sit and eat . He eats , and eats , one rare dish after another . ( Comically astonished ) But what 's this with the crepe suzettes ? A fly , is n't it ? A common fly ? ( He stops . The QUEEN waits expectantly . He does not go on ) p. 16 QUEEN ( Softly ) Well , why do you stop ? KING ( Earnestly ) It 's part of the bit . A man stops , does n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks , does n't he ? Is it worth it ? All the trying , and all the eating ? ( Slowly , very clearly ) Joe 's dead . Mary 's divorced . Johnny 's boy is stealing automobiles . Pat 's girl is breaking up the home of a dentist . QUEEN Bravo ! KING Thank you for stopping me . I might have gone on forever , from loneliness and despair . ( Pause ) Girl , it 's your turn . Do a bit , please . GIRL A bit ? DUKE ( Whispering ) The Pledge ! GIRL ( Salutes ) I pledge allegiance to the Flag , and to the Republic for which it stands . One nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . KING What bit is that ? DUKE The National Pledge , King ! KING I know it 's the National Pledge . But who the devil put it in a play ? p. 17 DUKE One of the new playwrights . KING Yes . They 're doing that sort of thing these days , are n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joyous lilt to his voice , almost singing ) Ah , Lord , what a lark it is to live ! Just to live  --  like a mouse , even . ( He does a light skipping step and breaks into song ) Jimmy Jellico , down the road , Come out of your house and dance with Daisy.Come out , my foolish , laughing , silly Jimmy.Your Ma is mad , your Pa is crazy , Come out , come out , and dance with Daisy . DUKE King , I did n't know you could sing , too ! KING ( Softly ) Your ma is mad , your pa is crazy . ( Pause ) And over there 's the bed . I sometimes think I 'm dead and have just remembered . It 's most strange . And then suddenly there I am  --  not dead . And that 's more strange than the other . Your turn then , Duke . A scene from a play , please . DUKE ( Opens the manuscript ) The first act of a play about some people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great city . KING Yes , yes , in search of  --  What are they in search of , Girl ? p. 18 DUKE ( Whispers , as GIRL turns to him for help ) Now , just do n't be afraid , that 's all . Tell him . GIRL Well , one 's looking for his father , another 's looking for his mother . Another 's looking for a home , another for a place to hide  --  QUEEN There is no hiding . None whatsoever . It ca n't be done . KING Ah , let her go on , will you ? One seeks a home , another a hiding place . Go on , Girl . GIRL One 's looking for a husband , another for a wife . DUKE ( Turning a page of the manuscript ) Ah , here we are . The lobby of the hotel . ( To the GIRL ) The moment I saw you I was sure I knew you . GIRL I was sure I knew you , too . KING Is that from the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I was sure I knew you . GIRL I was sure I knew you , too . QUEEN No , no , do n't go back . Never go back . DUKE But the line 's repeated , Queen . p. 19 QUEEN Ah , well , then . DUKE ( Acts ) I said to myself , I know her . I 've seen her before . GIRL I said to myself , I know him . I 've seen him before . KING ( After a pause ) Go on , please . DUKE ( Swiftly ) That 's all there is . He tries to smile and be polite , and so does she , but it does n't help , so she goes up to her room , and he goes out into the street . KING Another new playwright , I presume . DUKE Yes , sir . KING Very strange , I must say . QUEEN It 's not strange at all . KING Nothing happens . QUEEN Nothing happens ! It 's the story of our lives . KING Yes , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GIRL Yes , King . KING Stand before me , please . GIRL ( Stands there ) Yes , King . p. 20 KING Do not be afraid . ( Pause ) You have a bed ? DUKE I 'd like her to have my bed . QUEEN Your bed ? You 'd be dead by morning without your bed . DUKE My clothes are warm . QUEEN You must be very strong and handsome inside to be able to love with so much courtesy . DUKE No , Queen . I am a slob , inside and out , and all because fifteen years ago in my last fight , I was afraid I might kill my opponent with one blow . And so , down I went , killed with one blow by my opponent . ( Pause ) Whether I 'm dead or alive by morning , the Girl will be safe in my bed . Courtesy , or whatever you want to call it , Queen , is like training for a big fight , anyway , except that now I can look up and holler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Softly but clearly ) Help me to win without killing my opponent ! p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene 4 Later . Storm . Wind . The sounds of human sleeping  --  breathing , murmuring , a hum . The GIRL is asleep in the DUKE 'S bed . The QUEEN in her bed , and the KING in his . The DUKE is walking up and down , to keep warm . Every now and then he shadow-boxes in silence . Stops , bundles himself in his rags , walks again . He is remembering his big fight . He walks the boundary of the fight ring , takes his corner , and waits , looking up now and then . The gong is heard , but differently  --  like a chime  --  almost an invitation to sleep . And out of nowhere comes the charging young OPPONENT in trunks and boxing gloves . The DUKE puts up his arms and works fearfully , trying to keep away , but suddenly the OPPONENT tags him . He wobbles , tries to clinch , but is caught again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and steps back to watch the DUKE collapse . A voice is heard far away whispering one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . The DUKE gets to his feet , but the OPPONENT is on him again . He tries to clinch , but fails . Again the OPPONENT steps back to watch the DUKE collapse . The DUKE is counted out , as he gets to one knee . The OPPONENT helps him up , embraces him quickly , pats him on the back , and goes . The DUKE stands , dazed , unbelieving , and then sinks to one knee again . The GIRL sits up suddenly , notices him . Gets out of the bunk , fully clothed . Goes to him , shyly . She takes him by the arm , as if from the ring of failure and disgrace of long ago , and helps him into the bunk . The GIRL listens to the DUKE as he breathes heavily and then slowly quiets down and falls asleep . She then wanders around in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , but there is n't . She is cold , she shivers , her teeth chatter . She sits on a box and begins to work in the gun factory , doing the same thing over and over . A handsome YOUNG MAN comes , dancing a tango , bows to her , they dance , and then the YOUNG MAN goes . The KING sits up , notices the GIRL , gets off his bunk , and goes to her . Takes her by the arm to his bunk , and helps her to lie down . When she is asleep , the KING begins to walk around to keep warm , too . He then lies down and curls up like an animal , in the hope of finding warmth , but there is no warmth in him or in his rags or in curling up . A WOMAN with a small dog on a leash appears . The KING gets up quickly , becomes abject , holds out his hat . The WOMAN stops , looks away . The dog looks up at the KING . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , beggar ! beggar ! I 'd give my soul to change places with you for only one turn of the world . The WOMAN and the dog go . The QUEEN sits up , goes to him , takes him to her bed , helps him to lie upon it , and waits until he has fallen asleep . The QUEEN begins to cough , and then she sees herself as a beautiful young girl in rags , who comes and stares up at her a moment and then goes . The KING , the DUKE , and the GIRL sit up at the same time , look at the QUEEN , and then at one another . They listen to the raging storm . The GIRL goes to the QUEEN . The KING goes to the Stage Door , bolts it , places his ear to the door , and listens . The DUKE stands beside him . DUKE We all woke up at the same time , King . p. 22 KING Yes , I know we did . GIRL I dreamed a dream of love  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own , almost gone now , swift and silent , and speechless . KING I saw the little dog . DUKE And I lost the fight . King , what 's going on ? KING We 've come to a time . DUKE What kind of a time ? KING Cold . I 'm cold . ( His very voice seems frozen . He puts an arm around the QUEEN , another around the GIRL . The DUKE does the same . They stamp their feet to keep warm , and move slowly in a small circle ) QUEEN Why do you gather us into a circle ? KING Because we can get a little warmth from one another in a circle , that 's why . QUEEN ( Steps out of the circle , annoyed ) No , I refuse to join that church . KING It 's no church . It 's us  --  sleepless and cold . QUEEN No , I refuse . KING We 're cold , Woman , in a cold night , in a cold building , in a cold city . p. 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose . But for God 's sake , Man , please do not let a little cold and a little fear make a fool of you . I 'm cold , too , and so is she , and so is he , and for all I know this is my last night , or yours , or theirs , or anybody 's , but until my mind is gone entirely , I intend to stay alive as if this were the morning of the first day , and I a young girl with the world to seek . King , I say there is no death , even though I know I shall soon be no longer among the living . KING What the devil are you talking about , Woman ? Or have you gone mad ? GIRL Is that from a play ? DUKE Oh , no . GIRL Can I say something , then ? DUKE Of course you can . GIRL Queen , it was warmer when you were in the circle . QUEEN We need a fire , then , not a philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were in the circle . QUEEN I do n't want the circle to cure my cough . My cough is not an illness . It 's a language I have n't learned to understand yet . GIRL ( To the DUKE ) I said something . Now , you say something . p. 24 DUKE O.K. ( To the QUEEN ) It is better to stand together than to stand alone . QUEEN Duke , believe me , were you one of my own three sons , I could n't cherish you more , but I am afraid that what you have just said can do my pride as a mother very little good . KING Moses Himself almost said the same thing . QUEEN Go ahead , then . Hang together . Circle around like animals . Kneel and pray . Weep and moan . I 'd rather freeze to death alone . KING Will there never be a woman a man can be glad he met ? GIRL ( To the DUKE , quickly ) I 'm going to say something more . Oh , Queen , stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I invent no philosophies and no religions . We go along with the boys  --  until we get fed-up to here . ( She indicates her nose ) And then we say , Boys , go on alone now , please . Kill your-selves in the name of God , or truth , or justice , or the moon , or water , or ice cream , or anything else you can think of . Kill yourselves , and then explain it to us . We 'll be here waiting , and once again we 'll listen to the pitiful and pre-posterous explanation  --  how you were wrong but right but wrong but right . p. 25 KING I give up . If Christ Himself had had you around He would have sold oranges for a living . QUEEN I wish He had . Oranges are nice . I remember especially their lovely smell in the wintertime . KING All of the great thinkers and prophets would have forgotten their noble visions and pure dreams . QUEEN They should have . Their noble dreams and their pure visions did n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KING Hinder what ? QUEEN The real challenge . The only challenge , as you know . The challenge that is in each of us . If we are nothing involved in nothing and wish to be something involved in something , let us discover how we may achieve this transformation without fear , without lies , without humiliation , without be-littlement of ourselves and others , without violence . You came in from the streets not many hours ago and spoke against violence , did n't you ? KING Oh , I am the villain of the world , and all because I am a man . Woman , I 'm cold . I believed that with our arms about one another we might be a little warmer in our poor bodies . Now , why do you make of this simple act a crime against reason and right , thought and  --  theology , for instance ? p. 26 GIRL Are they acting ? DUKE Oh , no , they 're living . QUEEN That little circle is the mother  --  and the father  --  of violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not at all . It 's an act of fear . Fear of others unknown to us . But who are they , excepting ourselves again ? They are n't people from another planet . They have n't two heads to our one , four arms to our two , or another way to start and stop life . If you ca n't think , Man , at least try to remember . You 're not cold , you 're frightened . There is no danger , you 're old . KING A whole month she lies on that bed hanging onto life by the barest thread , but tonight when I must protect my family , she becomes Joan of Arc herself , grown old . QUEEN Protect ? There is no protection . KING No illness , no death , no danger , no defense , no protection . Girl , speak to your mother , please . Comfort her .

( To the QUEEN ) He 's a man . A very kind man . And now that I know he 's scared , I love him more than ever . p. 28 DUKE You love me ? GIRL Yes . DUKE Since when ? GIRL Since the minute I saw you , when I came out of hiding , expecting to see a whole world in ruins , and life itself breathing its last breath , and saw you instead , on this stage . Since then . A hundred years ago . DUKE ( To the QUEEN ) Do n't tell me something is n't happening . When I was young and strong , I was not loved . Oh , there were many , one after another , but I was n't loved . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , nothing more , and fun while it lasted . I was false , and they were false , and there was money to spend  --  and pride , and power , and arrogance , and youth , and laughter . And lies to use up . I did n't care . I wore the Crown , did n't I ? I 'd won the title , had n't I ? ( Almost amused but also amazed ) And then I lost the title , and they were all gone . And I was stupid . I 'd always been stupid  --  just strong and swift and lucky . Do n't love me , Girl . I 'm used to it . GIRL I love you . DUKE Do n't pity me , either . Pity hurts worse than hatred , worse than ridicule . I 'm not kind . When I was young and truly myself , and there was one like you among the others , I never so much as saw her . There is no kindness in me. p. 29 GIRL ( To the QUEEN ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Am I too good for him ? Am I radiant suddenly in the middle of the night ? I ca n't sleep . I ca n't rest . I ca n't forget . I 'm cold and alone , and I do n't want to be any more . ( Sounds of slow footsteps , of shuffling , stumbling , and falling are heard in the alley . Everybody hears the sounds , but as the sounds are faint , they do not pay very much attention to them ) DUKE Thank you for your love , Girl . Thank you very much , but in the morning  --  ( In the alley a WOMAN 's moan is heard , long and drawn out ) In the morning , Girl  --  ( A MAN 's voice is heard mumbling : Soon , soon now , soon )  --  when this strange night is over . ( There is a slow rattling of the bolted door , and then three knocks , not very loud , and slowly . The DUKE whispers ) DUKE King , there 's somebody out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? QUEEN Open the door , King . It 's somebody in need of help . DUKE No , let me open it . I 'm scared to death , but  --  well , I 'm the strongest here . ( He moves , the KING stops him ) p. 30 KING How can we help ? We have nothing here . Three beds for four people . Rags for clothes . No food . No fire . How can we help ? QUEEN By not being afraid , of course . KING But I am afraid , and so are you . I do n't know what 's out there . I 'm not even sure it 's human . Sometimes it sounds human , sometimes it does n't . But even if we were n't afraid , why should we open the door ? There 's a whole world out there , full of fortunate people in their own homes , not in a hulk of a haunted theatre . Let them help , whoever or whatever it is . ( He listens ) Perhaps they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft moan is heard again ) Ah , I do n't know what to make of it . Why should they come here ? We 're better than half-dead ourselves . How can we help ? Help with what ? ( Sounds ) QUEEN You made a human circle a moment ago . Bring them into that circle , as an act of love . ( Sounds ) KING I do n't know who they are . QUEEN It does n't matter who they are . They are in need . This is a theatre , Man , not a cave . We are people of the theatre , not animals . ( Sounds ) p. 31 KING I ca n't argue with a woman . Let 's ask one another , then , if this is what we must do . Girl , shall we open the door ? ( Sounds ) GIRL Yes , King . KING That 's already two against two . How about you , Duke ? DUKE I do n't know . I do n't seem to be able to think any more , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does , and says open the door , what can I , twice her size , ten times her strength , say ? I 'll open the door , King . ( Sounds ) KING Well , now , it 's three to one , and the last is myself , six charlatans , and half a dozen lunatics . I 'll open the door . DUKE No , let me , King . KING Stand together at the edge of the stage there . It 's a large theatre , and there are other places in which to hide , if need be . ( They stand together at the edge of the stage . The KING stands up straight , ready to go ) QUEEN King ? KING Yes , Woman ? QUEEN I love you , sir . KING You talk too much . ( The KING walks swiftly to the door , opens it , and a MAN leaning upon it almost falls into his arms ) p. 32 FATHER ( Whispers ) Thank you , thank you , thank you . ( The KING supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking upright , follows the MAN . The QUEEN , the GIRL , and the DUKE gasp , the KING turns , sees the BEAR , tries to hide behind the MAN ) Do n't be afraid of him . But for God 's sake , somebody please help my wife . ( A WOMAN 's long moan is heard , then a cry of a newborn baby . The MAN begins to walk toward the sound , falls upon the BEAR , who holds him up . The GIRL runs out , followed by the QUEEN ) @x Several hours later . The BEAR stands to one side , chained to the floor . It still moans , but softer , and sways . On one cot lies the MAN asleep . On another lies a WOMAN , also asleep . The GIRL and the QUEEN are busy around the third cot , on which an INFANT sleeps . The DUKE is gone . The KING is at the open Stage Door , waiting apprehensively . The QUEEN looks over at him now and then . The KING turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it . KING ( Almost to himself ) A moaning bear in the middle of the night ? In New York City ? How should I have known ? Is a bear human ? ( To the BEAR ) You scared me , sir . ( The BEAR replies with a soft moan ) Yes , things are much improved now . ( To the GIRL ) And how is the child ? GIRL Suppose we had n't opened the door ? KING God help me , I was against it . I 'll never deny that . I thought it was  --  anything but a trained bear , and a human family . A trained bear has saved the life of a new man , his mother , and his father . ( The BEAR moans ) You moan most fearfully , sir . ( The BEAR moans sweetly ) It was n't like that a little while ago , but then there was reason enough for it not to be . p. 34 QUEEN You talk good sense to the bear , King . Better sense than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I associate them with my father . You understand , Woman , I 'm uneasy about how long the Duke 's been gone . And I 'm worried about the few coins he had with which to buy a little milk for the boy . QUEEN Was there enough ? KING Enough perhaps for one bottle . A small bottle , most likely . I tell you , there 's no money in begging any more . ( Suddenly ) What the devil 's happened to him ? ( He thinks a moment ) Oh , no ! QUEEN What are you thinking ? KING A foul and base thought , Woman . I refuse to name it . ( Ashamed ) Could it be  --  oh , no  --  I refuse . QUEEN Could it be what ? KING The Duke has run off with the money ? QUEEN Foul and base indeed . Of course not . But could he have fallen somewhere ? He 's not strong at all , you know . ( To the GIRL , who has joined them ) A whole month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needs food more than we do . Could he have fallen somewhere ? p. 35 GIRL ( Wraps a shawl around her ) I 'll go look for him . QUEEN Well , now , let 's not all disappear , one by one . No ! He 's not fallen . I 'm sure of it . It was daybreak when he went out . There are few places where milk may be bought at that hour . He 'll certainly be back soon , but when the milk is here , remember this  --  I shall be in charge . For us , water  --  all of us , including you , sir . ( The BEAR nods , moans ) The milk 's for the mother only . KING What about the child ? QUEEN The mother will take care of the child , as she already has . KING Oh . QUEEN We have no bottles and no formulas , and the mother has everything . GIRL I have this ring . Perhaps I can sell it , and buy some  --  bread . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) QUEEN It 's a beautiful ring , Girl . GIRL It looks real , does n't it ? QUEEN Terribly . And it is , too , but it is n't worth money . Now , there is water in the jug . We can each drink water , at any rate . When the mother and father are restored a little  --  well , who knows ? Perhaps the father has money . p. 36 KING He has a bear , no money . If he 'd had money , would he have come to this door , in that storm ? QUEEN Very well , then , a bear . Now our acting company has been enlarged by one trained bear , and  --  KING Just a minute . You 're not thinking they 're to stay for some time ? QUEEN They 're here , sir . And , as you know , they barely made it . ( Very clearly ) These people  --  and I include the bear  --  are here . Beyond that door , beyond this theatre , is a whole world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I do n't know , and I do n't care . They 're here . For how long is none of my business , but while they are here , they are here , and friends , and members of the family . ( Running is heard . They all turn toward the door . The DUKE , breathless , comes in , carrying a whole wire crate containing six quart-bottles of milk . The KING closes the door and puts the metal bolt in place ) QUEEN Bravo ! DUKE I 'm a poor thief ! QUEEN Under that bed , Duke . ( The DUKE hurries to the MOTHER 'S bed with the crate , slides it under , and out of sight ) p. 37 DUKE I 'll go to jail if I must , but they ca n't have back the milk . They ca n't have both . KING You were seen ? DUKE I was chased . ( He brings out the coins ) There were no stores open . ( He hands the money to the KING ) A mile away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted for one quart was more than I had . I wanted a cup of coffee more than anything I 've ever wanted in my whole life  --  ( He looks over at the MOTHER asleep , and at the CHILD )  --  but I went out and started walking again , and there all of a sudden right in front of me was the milk wagon . ( Pause ) The whole place is covered with snow . All of the ruins around us are covered . I mean , I cut through the ruins when they chased me . KING Who chased you ? DUKE The milkman , and a boy . His son , I guess . ( Softly ) One thing I do n't understand . They ran in silence . They did n't shout stop thief ! The father was swiftest at first , and then the son left him far behind . I 'll tell you this . When I was in training for the big fight I never ran the way I did just now . I do n't get it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have that milk . p. 38 KING You 'd better have a little yourself . DUKE No . It 's not for me . If I had stolen it for myself , I could never have run that well . KING And the boy and his father ? You lost them ? DUKE How could I lose them ? We ran in snow . KING Hide , then . Over there . DUKE Hide , King ? After I ran that way ? No , thank you . I do n't want to hide . ( Footsteps are heard , quick and light ) Well , here he is . ( They all look at one another . There is a gentle , almost polite , knock on the door . The DUKE goes to open it . The KING stops him ) KING Wait . Wait . DUKE No , we waited last time . It 's all right . I do n't mind . ( The DUKE opens the door , and there in the doorway is a BOY of eighteen or nineteen , dark and grave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says nothing , and as the DUKE steps back , somewhat asking him in by that movement , the BOY comes in . He takes his time looking around  --  at everybody and everything . His eyes go back again and again to the GIRL , but his face remains grave . Nobody says anything . The BOY passes beside each bed , looking at each occupant , and then back at the group watching him . He looks up to the top of the theatre , and far out into the auditorium . He goes to the MOTHER 'S bed , squats , draws out the crate , looks around at everybody , shoves the crate back . He gets up , and walks back to the Stage Door ) p. 39 DUKE ( Softly ) I 'll go with you to the police , if you like . ( The BOY looks at him , looks at the GIRL , shakes his head , turns and goes . Everybody looks at one another ) DUKE Well , why did n't he speak ? Why did n't he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? GIRL He told me so . DUKE How could he tell you so ? He did n't say one word ? GIRL He told me a lot of things . ( An explosion is heard , falling debris , and the voices of the WORKERS ) KING ( Straightens up , hands coins to QUEEN ) Off to work , then . In the snow perhaps the people will be more generous . ( Goes to the door , stops , turns ) I hate to beg . ( He goes , followed by the DUKE ) p. 40 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene 2 Early that afternoon . The MOTHER of the infant has the CHILD beside her in bed , the bed partly screened off . The CHILD cries . Stops . QUEEN Oh , what a lovely voice , what a lovely anger in that voice ! MOTHER Oh , Mother , your love for my child makes me proud . ( The FATHER , working over an open straw suitcase , brings out cymbals for the BEAR , turns , looks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Wife ? It 's a miracle the poor fellow 's alive , so feed him , feed him . MOTHER ( To the QUEEN ) I love to feed him . I never knew . FATHER So now you know . MOTHER ( To the GIRL ) Get with a man , to get your own man , like this fellow . QUEEN Soon , now , but it is still a secret . GIRL What is ? QUEEN The Silent Boy , of course . GIRL No , Queen . I love the other . p. 41 QUEEN The other is a boy , too , or was , but it is not him you love . GIRL Him alone . No other . QUEEN To argue love is lovely , but the Silent Boy is love . GIRL No , Queen . QUEEN Ah , then , love them both . GIRL No , just the one , my husband . FATHER Women ! It 's all women here ! And the secrets of them . ( To the BEAR ) All right , Gorky , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The BEAR strikes the cymbals together in a rhythm , as the FATHER sings : ) Walking on my own two feet , walking , walking down the street . The street was fair , the street was sweet , walking on my own two feet . ( He stops ) Good , Gorky . ( He gives GORKY a cube of sugar ) Now , rest a moment , while I get my coat and cap . ( He fishes into the open suitcase on the floor , brings out a coat which he puts on , and a cap , both bright and covered with buttons and bells . Another cap he puts on the BEAR . He goes to the women ) Well , now , Gorky 's ready again , and so am I , Wife . We 'll go out and work . With luck , who knows ? Perhaps a little money for a big family . p. 42 QUEEN You 've had no food . There 's milk in the jug . For you and for the bear . FATHER After work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAR moans ) Well , perhaps a little for Gorky , then . QUEEN A little for yourself , too . FATHER I work best hungry . It 's been the way of my life . ( Points ) That child began in hunger . She was my bread and wine , and now she 's his , too , and the both of them to me , a miracle . Great good God , I thought the door would never open . I knew you were in here , because Gorky would not leave the door . Would you , Man ? ( The BEAR moans as the FATHER receives a bowl of milk from the QUEEN and places it on the floor before GORKY . The QUEEN pours milk into another bowl , holds it out to the MAN . He shakes his head ) FATHER Ready , then , Gorky ! One , two , three , now : ( The BEAR clangs the cymbals together , as the FATHER and the BEAR walk to the far end of the stage , turn , and go straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking down the street , walking , walking down the street . Walking on my own two feet , walking on my own two feet . The street was fair , the street was sweet , walking on my own two feet . p. 43 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene 3 A little later . The three women , alone . The QUEEN is at the table . The GIRL is seated on a small box beside the sleeping MOTHER and CHILD , humming softly . After a moment , she sings softly in a kind of lullaby : Rock , rock , rock to sleep . A mother and a man . Rock in the dark , rock in the light . Rock in the heart the whole long night . Rock , rock , rock to sleep . A woman and a man . GIRL Oh , if only I were beautiful , as she is . QUEEN Oh , you will be , do n't you worry about that . It 's the birth that 's made her beautiful . Here . Drink this . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRL ) GIRL ( Takes the bowl ) His ? QUEEN Yes , Girl . The Silent Boy . GIRL How , Queen ? Do I wait all my life for love , and then when it comes , do I say suddenly , Ah , no , that was not love , this is love ? QUEEN Yes , Girl . GIRL No , Queen . No . QUEEN The Boy loves you , and you love him . He told you so better than if he had speech . And you told him so . p. 44 GIRL I did n't . QUEEN You did n't want to , because you thought it was wrong . But you did . Be glad you did . GIRL How can I be glad ? The Man loves me , and needs me , and only last night I begged him not to deny his love . How can I be glad ? QUEEN Be glad , and never mind how . GIRL I 'm not that kind of a woman . QUEEN You 're the only kind . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . To be kind to the Man is to be unkind to the Boy . Unkind to him is unkind to life , and to yourself . GIRL If that 's true , I do n't want to be kind to myself . Or to life . ( Suddenly ) I wish the Man had never stolen , and the Boy had never followed him here . QUEEN Why do n't you thank God you love him ? GIRL I 'll never see him again , that 's why . Everyone I ever lovedI never saw again . And I ached and rotted . ( With decision ) I love the Man . No other . I 'll see him again . QUEEN You 'll see the Boy again , too . p. 45 GIRL ( Stands , looks at the QUEEN with terrible earnestness ) I will , wo n't I ? ( The QUEEN smiles . The GIRL seems shocked at herself ) No , Queen . It 's not true . I love only the Man , not the Boy . Let me have my poor Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not for me . He never was . Besides , my Man outran him . Oh , I was proud  --  until  --  QUEEN Until you saw the Boy ! GIRL Why is that so ? How is it so ? It is so , but why ? The way he stood there , and walked , and looked , and understood . Oh , thank God I 'll never see him again . My love is too good for me . But why ? QUEEN In the theatre , long ago , I had a part once  --  a girl in love as you are . And I was torn , and angry , and ashamed , and frightened , and insecure . Did I love him ? Did he love me ? And if I did , and if he did , would we both know ? Or would n't we , and then would I lose the other , too ? Or the little love I had for the other ? Would that little be gone , too ? And then nothing at all ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GIRL And how did it turn out ? QUEEN It was a bad play . p. 46 GIRL Oh , no , please . How did it turn out ? The Boy , of course . You loved the Boy , of course . And he loved you . QUEEN ( Obviously not telling the truth ) I never found out . It was the fault of the play . Plays are written . They can go any way . GIRL And which way did that play go ? QUEEN The bad way . The man who wrote the play  --  ah , what a sad man , and yet how he could write . He came to the rehearsals , and now and then explained why this and why that , but it was all to the end that he was sad , and very troubled , and deathly sick . He drank all the time and tried to pretend he knew why the play was bad . GIRL Why was it bad ? QUEEN He said it was because it was true , but that 's the lie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if anything were n't true . As if one of the true may not be chosen over another . Poor man , poor lying wonderful man . He was joyous in my girl 's failure . True , he said . It 's true to lose , he said . He rejoiced in my wretchedness . GIRL Oh , no , no . QUEEN Oh , it was a good part , and believe me I made the most of it . I lost the Boy . I lost the Man , but the play ran and ran . Ah , you see , the playwright said , how right I was to choose the true . The people know . And all the time it was n't so at all , it was the art of us , the players , that the people cherished . The play was bad , but do you know , it is still considered a good play ? Unbelievable , and yet there it is . Why , the man who wrote it drank himself to death before the play closed . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate , or hate chose him . It was his business to choose love , to write a better play , and to live to write another . p. 47 GIRL But what happened , what happened to you in the play ? QUEEN It was n't to me , it was to him , the playwright . I played my part . That 's my work , our work . We do n't write them , we perform them . GIRL In the play what happened to you ? He said it was true . Is the same thing going to happen to me ? QUEEN What happened to me in the play is going to happen to you , too , or not , as you choose , as if you were writing the play , choosing from among the true , the true for you , which is the Silent Boy , who was not chosen for me by the playwright . GIRL How do I choose ? Is it as simple as that ? I love him . I 'm ashamed that I do , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to do with it ? Who chose him to be the milkman 's son ? Who chose the Duke to go out and steal the milk ? Who chose the Silent Boy to follow him here ? Who chose him to come in and to look and to understand ? I did n't . QUEEN Ah , but when he looked at you , and looked again , you , and nobody else , chose him to love you . GIRL And what did he choose ? QUEEN And he chose to love you , as you know . GIRL And he went , as silently as he came , and there we are  --  nowhere again , nothing again . p. 48 QUEEN He 'll be back . GIRL Do you think so ? Do you really think so ? I 've waited all day . Why has n't he come back ? I love him , but if he does n't come back , who do I love ? Do I wait , and then go looking for him ? QUEEN He 'll come looking for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the truth , is n't it ? No matter what happened in the play , he will come looking for me , wo n't he ? QUEEN Yes , he will . But if he does n't  --  GIRL No , he must . Please do n't even think he may not . I 'm thinking that , and I need you to stop me . QUEEN Ah , well , we shall see , we shall see . ( Points ) Rest there on the King 's bed . You 've had no sleep . And I shall lie here , on the lonely bed of the poor brave Duke , God help him . p. 49 Act 2 , Scene 4 Scene 4 A little later . The QUEEN is making the bed she has slept on . The GIRL is making the one she has slept on . The KING comes in . He has lost one of his shoes , and he is angry at himself . KING Ah , damn me , I went out with two shoes , and I came back with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me damn me first , please  --  damn me , damn me , damn me . Now what the devil am I going to do with only one shoe ? How am I to get about ? ( Rubbing his foot , after removing the rag of a sock ) There ought to be a pair of shoes somewhere in this theatre . Girl , see if you can find me a pair of shoes , will you please ? GIRL Lost your shoe ? How can a man lose his shoe ? His head , perhaps , his heart , his mind  --  how can he lose a shoe ? KING Look for a pair of shoes , please  --  damn me , damn me , damn me . Where 's the bear ? Where 's the man of the bear ? QUEEN They 're out to work . The bear crashes cymbals together , and the man sings . He wears a colored coat and cap . KING And the bear ? QUEEN A colored cap . p. 50 KING Damn me , damn me , damn me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , I 'll guess . Is it Lear , the great Father ? Lear was once my name  --  damn me . QUEEN What happened to your shoe ? KING Hatchet , rue ; latchet , rue ; patchet , rue ; rickey  --  rue  --  wash ! QUEEN Oh , speak , Clown ! KING Damn me , damn me , damn me  --  I am speaking . Hatchet , latchet , patchet ! Did you find me a pair of shoes , Girl ? GIRL No , King . KING Damn me . QUEEN Will you please talk sense ? KING The infant ? The mother ? QUEEN They 're both well . KING The Silent Boy ? Did he come back ? ( The GIRL turns , and looks at the KING ) QUEEN No , but he will . KING Damn me , damn me . What name have they given the boy ? QUEEN He 's a boy , and they know it , and the boy knows it , and knows how a boy 's a boy , and so all day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call him George . It 's a nice name . Henry . That 's a nice name , too . I once knew a Polish clown named Stanislaus . He never looked the part . Stan , that 's all  --  Stan . Damn me , damn me , damn me . ( Suddenly ) I gambled my shoe , and lost it . Call him Frederic . There 's a nice sound to Frederic . QUEEN Gambled your shoe ? KING Yes , gambled my shoe , gambled my shoe . The Wreckers , knocking down the rotten old buildings , just a little off from here . I thought I 'd get a coin or two , after a whole day of failure  --  not one coin  --  not one , but a small boy gave me this . I 'll never see that Boy again , most likely , but one day when he 's an old man , a small boy will give him something . ( He shows a yo-yo ) The Boss of the wrecking crew out there , and ten or eleven others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little fire in the ruins . Call the man Patrick . It 's a nice name . Ah , you all need a laugh , I said , and I need a little of that coffee , so the Boss fills a mug for me , and another worker lights me one of his own cigarettes . The snow is coming down soft , soft . I 'll give you a laugh , I said . Ah , we 've had our laughs all day , they said . The falling walls make us laugh . Ah , then , I said , I 'll give you a tear . ( He looks over at the MOTHER and the sleeping INFANT ) Call him Robert . It 's a fine name . You ? Give us a tear ? they said . How ? I 'm a clown , I said . Very well , they said , give one of us a tear , just one of us , and each of us will give you a coin . But fail , Clown , and what will you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . The shoe of my right foot . Call the boy John . John 's one of the nicest names of all . p. 52 QUEEN You lost that bet ? KING Ah , the world 's laughing . The workers laugh . In the snow , even . I did my captured-thief bit that brought tears to the eyes of the world only a few years ago . I did the hungry man who stole the apple pie . Call the boy Richard . Ah , Richard 's a fine name . He 'll do well called Richard . Had I been called Richard I might have been a chef ! I did my rejected lover bit , and all they did was laugh  --  but not hard enough to bring a tear to one eye , and every one of them has two . I cheated a little because I knew I was losing , and I did a little of my ridiculed-orator bit , where the man speaks most nobly and all they do is throw vegetables at him . And then a little of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made everybody weep ? And blow their noses ? The workers only laughed . They drank coffee and smoked cigarettes and laughed . I bent down to take off my shoe , but the Boss said , Ah , keep the shoe , Clown , keep it . But I refused . I may be a shameless beggar but I am a proud clown . Damn me , damn me , damn me . QUEEN It was only a game . They did n't mean it . KING Woman , for the love of God , I did mean it . What the devil 's happened to the world ? To the workers ? Not one tear in one eye . If I 've lost my art , what good is my shoe ? ( Explosion , debris , voices ) That 's them . Damn me , damn me , damn me ! ( Suddenly ) Ah , they even offered me coins , but I refused them . p. 53 QUEEN You had no right to refuse coins . KING Did I have a right to fail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed ) And there 's my bed . QUEEN Lie down , then . You 've had no sleep or rest . That 's why you failed . KING Is it , woman ? Is that it ? QUEEN Go , lie down . KING Oh , I long to . I long to , Woman . Forever , if you ask me . ( He stretches out ) Damn me , damn me , damn me for my failure . Call the boy  --  Clown . ( He falls asleep ) p. 54 Act 2 , Scene 5 Scene 5 An hour or two later . The KING is still stretched out on his bed . The BEAR is chained to the floor . The FATHER is working with the DUKE , and the BEAR , in a new act . The QUEEN and the GIRL are setting the table  --  bread , mainly . FATHER All right now , Gorky . Watch carefully . ( Puts his arms around the DUKE ) This man is my friend . He 's your friend . He saved our lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , we need this man 's help . Instead of marching , music , songs and dances  --  wrestling ! A man and a bear . The Duke , and you , Gorky . ( Embraces the DUKE ) See ? I embrace him  --  but gently , gently . Understand ? He is a friend , a dear friend . We need him . In three hours of work without the woman , you and I , Gorky , earned nothing , not one coin . Oh , the weather was against us , but even in the worst weather , with the woman , we have always managed to earn something . ( To the DUKE ) All right , now , do n't be afraid , Duke . Gorky understands . You understand , do n't you , Gorky ? A friend ? A very dear friend ? You are to play at wrestling with him . You are not to wrestle in earnest . He is a man , and you are a bear , another thing . ( The BEAR listens , turning its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of what the FATHER is saying ) Are you ready , Duke ? ( The QUEEN and the GIRL stop to watch ) p. 55 DUKE Well , wrestling 's not my line , you know . I 'm ready , but I 've never wrestled . A man , or a bear . ( Looks around ) I wish the King were awake . FATHER Gorky 's an intelligent man  --  well , I think of him as a man . He 's stronger than ten strong men , but he 's gentle , too . A father and a brother to those he loves . DUKE I love Gorky , but does Gorky love me ? FATHER Well , he 's beginning to , he 's beginning to . He senses that everybody here is a friend , but he 's not sure yet . I 'm teaching him now , and he learns quickly . ( Gives GORKY a cube of sugar . Hands one to the DUKE . The DUKE starts to eat it ) No . No . Given the sugar to Gorky . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sugar out to him , but the BEAR does n't take it ) DUKE You see ? He does n't love me at all . FATHER Gorky ? My boy ? This is my friend . Your friend . Take the sugar from him . ( GORKY is undecided ) Take it , Gorky . ( GORKY does not take it ) DUKE I want to help . We 've got a child to take care of now . All day I saw all kinds of things that I wanted to take  --  for the Boy . But I lost my nerve . I took nothing . p. 56 GIRL I 'm glad . I worried that you might take something and that I might never see you again . DUKE I begged , too , but I 'm a poor beggar . Prizefighters always are . I 've got to help , that 's all . I 'm not afraid of the bear . It 's just that I 'm not a wrestler . Could n't we box ? FATHER Oh , no . That is an American sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike him one blow that hurt him a little , just a little , perhaps no more than an irritation , he would go mad , and he would kill . Boxing is swift and violent . He could never understand it . But wrestling is another thing . He will soon associate it with friendship and love and simple animal play . Do n't be afraid . GIRL No , please . I am afraid . I love the bear , as we all do . But the wrestling of a man and a bear  --  it will never seem true to the people , in any case . ( DUKE eats the sugar cube , noisily and slowly ) FATHER True or not , they love it , and it brings in money . Streets , fairs , carnivals , perhaps even the circus , at last . My problem is that I am small , no match at all for the bear , but the Duke is a big man , almost as big as a bear , and their wrestling together would make our fortune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quickly ) All right , Gorky . ( He seizes GORKY , tries to throw him . The BEAR picks him up in his arms , rocks him , kisses him , murmurs to him , puts him down gently ) You see ? It would never do . I 've tried and tried . If I were to strike him , which I have done only once , when he began to walk after a man who had kicked him , a man he would have crushed to death , Gorky still loved me . If I were to strike him , it would n't help matters any . He 's never understood why I struck him , how I could do a thing like that to him  --  him  --  and even now , after three long years , he still broods about it . Some things he understands , and some he does n't . He has never been able to associate that sudden violence in me with love , and yet he has gone along on faith , waiting , waiting for understanding . ( To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow we will have the beginning of a great new act . We will all be working again . Now , Gorky , my father , my brother , my son , listen to me . This man is our friend . ( He embraces the DUKE . The KING sits up , half-asleep , watches and listens ) p. 57 GIRL No . No . Something else . He is a kind man , and he will try , he will try anything that may help , but no . I 'm afraid . DUKE Do you love me , Girl ? Is that it ? ( The QUEEN holds out her arm toward the GIRL , as if to urge her to speak truthfully ) Because if you do love me , then by God the bear must love me , too . QUEEN Of course she loves you , Duke . We all love you . You are kind . DUKE I mean love , Queen . Does she love me , or was that last night ? Another time , another story ? GIRL I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all hungry and cold and lonely , but if you do not love me entirely , as foolishly as you did last night , there is no need to pretend . GIRL I love you . QUEEN Oh , wait , wait . Love speaks a strange language . Man , she does love you . Of course she loves you . Besides kindness , there is great handsomeness in you , which no woman could not love in men in general , and in the one man of her heart . ( She stops ) p. 58 DUKE Go on , Queen . QUEEN She is ashamed that while she loves you , she also loves  --  GIRL No . No . QUEEN  --  the Silent Boy . In your youth , in the days of your fame , it was so with you , too , Man . You remember . Of course you do . DUKE I remember , Queen . ( To the GIRL ) Thank you for pretending , Girl , and please be glad . Be glad . I am your friend . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The DUKE smiles , as he comforts her , whispering ) I am your friend . ( The GIRL draws away , then goes to the QUEEN . The DUKE looks around , and then goes to the KING . He begins to walk toward the door suddenly ) QUEEN Duke ? ( The DUKE stops . She goes to him . Turns him around ) What is it , Man ? DUKE ( As if he were saying , " I want to beg God for Grace " ) I want to beg . ( He gestures ) QUEEN You 've had no food . Take this bread . DUKE Bread , Queen ? ( He struggles with his emotions , looks up , speaks bitterly , powerfully ) Give the bread to the well-fed Boy ! ( Earnestly ) Oh , I 'm sorry . Please forgive me . ( He hurries out ) p. 59 FATHER He 's too old for you , Girl . GIRL ( Angry ) He 's not too old . My love is too little . No man loves as he loves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silent Boy does n't know I 'm alive . Oh , I hate love . FATHER Ah , you may lose them both , and find another , or two others , and lose them , too , from loving them too much or too little or something else . And still the world is there , and you 're on the stage , right in the middle of everything . Love has no reason , or rightness , or way . ( He waves at his wife ) The Bear loved her . I did n't , at first . The bear hummed when he saw her . His soul turned sweet and gentle . For me it might have been her , it might have been somebody else . The Bear decided for me , and there she is , the mother of my son , my firstborn . Of all the women in the world was she the only one to be the mother of my son ? No , Girl . It happened . It happened , and now it 's the law , and history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big time , and love is a word , if you 're not busy with a bear , or a boy to put on his feet . GIRL I want to believe in love , Queen , whether it 's a word or something else . FATHER It 's a word all right , and something else , too . And that 's the part that 's hard to follow . What else is it ? ( Almost jabbering ) Well , get up , get up now , get along into another day . Love is getting along into another day , getting to work , whatever your work is . The rest of love is  --  who knows ? I love her . And I love the boy beside her . What does that mean ? What does it mean ? It means I 've got to teach the Bear to wrestle a big man without hurting him . And our big man has gone . Now , he 'll come back , wo n't he ? p. 60 QUEEN I wonder . There were tears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He belongs here . And now he 's gone , and I 'm here , and I do n't belong here . He lied for me , Queen , out of kindness and pity . What theatre have I known ? One potato , two potato ? Is that being in the theatre ? I pledge allegiance to the Flag . Is that acting ? How do you do , my partner . Is that something in an opera ? I came here lost , and he found me , and helped me , and protected me . He saved my life . I 've learned more since I 've been here than in all the rest of the time of my life . He lied to let me stay , and I told the truth to drive him out . Queen , I 'll go find him now , and just say I 'm sorry for being such a truthful dirty liar , and then I 'll go my way . KING ( Gets up , speaks softly ) Well , if anyone here should be angry , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that we ca n't learn . But I am not even angry about that , Girl , and there is no need for you to be , either . This is how it is . If we were in a palace , instead of in this cave , this would be how it is . If we had everything , and more than everything , this would be how it is . If we loved God and God loved us , this would be how it is . And I am not angry . I can not be angry . This is the world , this is us , this is all there is , and we do not understand . p. 61 GIRL Then , what 's it for , Father ? What 's it for ? KING For this , precisely this . GIRL The lies , too ? KING There are no lies . What 's it for ? It 's for putting up with  --  with humor , if possible . Without excuses , without astonishment , without regret , without shame , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not be angry at yourself for being who you are . If you think you are not truth and beauty , perhaps you are mistaken . GIRL Thank you , Father . I do n't belong here . KING Nobody belongs here , but here we are . My father and my mother did n't think ! No , they did n't . But even if they had , as so many have , I still would n't belong here , and nobody else would , either . The Bear belongs here , and all his kind . We 're another creature . We know enough to know we know nothing , and it is terrible and wonderful . They know nothing but do not know that they know nothing , and it is neither terrible nor wonderful-it just is . His name is Gorky . But his mother never gave him the name . She looked at him and there he was . A bear , and not a tiger , or a rabbit , or a hawk . We think , and remember , and speak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things of all kinds , on purpose . We do all these things because we do n't belong here . It 's not our place . It 's a cave . What are we doing in a cave ? We 're angels . What are we doing in bodies ? ( Pause ) For some reason , we 're trying our best , helplessly , to pretend that we are in them , that we belong in them , and that we are here , and that we belong here . ( He goes to the door ) I 'll go fetch my shoe , now . I failed , and I know I failed . ( He goes ) p. 62 GIRL I 'll go now , too . FATHER ( Shouts ) Ah , stay , girl ! You 've been a great help to my wife and son . GIRL He did n't come back . I thought he would . I thought he loved me . FATHER How do you know he does n't ? QUEEN He did this morning . GIRL This morning . How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , and this is tonight , and he did n't come back . There 's no reason for me to stay any longer . Goodbye . FATHER ( Shouts ) Goodbye ! Everybody 's always saying goodbye . You 've got no place to go . Before you 've even left , it 's already as good as another year gone by anyway , and you 've come back-so stay , stay ! ( There is a loud and merry knock at the door . The QUEEN and the GIRL look at one another , desperately , hopefully . The FATHER goes to the door , opens it . It is the WRECKING CREW BOSS , and a NEGRO HELPER ) WRECKING CREW BOSS ( Comes in , looks at everybody , then speaks softly ) What 's this ? We knocked as a joke . People ? Here ? What 's that over there ? p. 63 FATHER That 's Gorky , my bear . And who are you , sir ? WRECKING CREW BOSS The foreman of the wrecking crew . And the women , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing about love . How it works and what it means . Maybe you can tell ' em . What 's it mean ? WRECKING CREW BOSS I do n't know , but I know that this beautiful old building is next for the dynamite . ( He glances up , and around ) FATHER The dynamite ? This is a theatre , man . WRECKING CREW BOSS So it is , so it is , but down it comes just the same first thing tomorrow morning , along with all the other buildings in this area . Rooming houses , offices , stores , churches  --  all old , all rotted , all finished  --  to make way for the new . But I 've loved every poor old wreck of a place that my men and I have brought down . Look up there , Jamie  --  it 's a high and handsome place , now , is n't it ? FATHER Yes , while you 're at it , Jamie , look over there . That 's my wife . She became a mother early this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved now . They need time . WRECKING CREW BOSS ( Near a box ) May I sit down ? I have a longing to sit down in here . p. 64 QUEEN Welcome , sir . WRECKING CREW BOSS ( Looking at her strangely ) Thank you . ( Looks at the Girl , as he sits ) And the girl there ? She 's your daughter ? QUEEN In a manner of speaking . WRECKING CREW BOSS What manner is that ? QUEEN For three months short of a year an old man of the theatre and I have lived here . He found this theatre in the morning , and I found it in the afternoon . He called me the Queen , and I called him the King . Then , a month ago , an old prizefighter found this place , and yesterday this girl found it . All in all , a family  --  a great Clown begging as a free man in the human streets rather than leave the theatre , and me and the prizefighter , and this Girl , who is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks at Jamie ) How many shoes does he wear ? QUEEN Two when he has two , but now he has one . WRECKING CREW BOSS We know the man . This afternoon he made us roar with laughter . Madam , what is your problem ? QUEEN Mine , sir ? I have no problem . p. 65 WRECKING CREW BOSS The problem of your family , then ? QUEEN Love , of course . Survival , and love . And what is your problem , sir ? WRECKING CREW BOSS How best , swiftest , most safely , and least expensively to bring this  --  mansion  --  down into ruins , and then to clear away the debris . QUEEN Simple . WRECKING CREW BOSS ( Holding a crust of bread ) May I ? QUEEN Please , sir . And something to drink ? WRECKING CREW BOSS No , thanks , just this bread . I am confused , and my teeth need something to work upon . I 'm poor at words , and at thinking , too , if you ask me . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WRECKING CREW BOSS What can we do , Jamie ? JAMIE I could go find the Old Man and give him back his shoe . I 've kept it in a safe place , but he could never find it . I just thought it ought to be kept in a safe place . WRECKING CREW BOSS The mother and the child ca n't be moved , Jamie . JAMIE No , sir , they can't. p. 66 WRECKING CREW BOSS Tomorrow 's Friday , and the day after is Saturday , and then Sunday . ( He thinks a moment , and then speaks suddenly ) Jamie , tell my boys , tell my crew , tell them all at once and one by one , do you hear , Jamie ? JAMIE Yes , sir . WRECKING CREW BOSS All at once and one by one , Boys , he says we 're all to be sick tomorrow , and the day after . Use the name you have for me among you , I do n't mind  --  I 've only pretended to mind . Tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the day after . That 's all . Just sick . Every one of us . At home . In bed . Coughing , and sweating . I want to study this problem carefully . It may take me a little time . JAMIE Yes , sir . WRECKING CREW BOSS And Jamie ? JAMIE Yes , sir . WRECKING CREW BOSS ( Brings money from his pocket ) Find the Great Man , and give him back his shoe , and then step into that little store we all go to at lunchtime . Buy us  --  well , you know , Jamie , the things we like  --  but a lot of it . I 'm very hungry . JAMIE Yes , sir . Everybody sick until Monday morning . p. 67 WRECKING CREW BOSS Jamie ? JAMIE Yes , sir . WRECKING CREW BOSS If anybody asks why  --  ( He waits a long time , shakes his head quickly ) There is no why . JAMIE Yes , sir . ( JAMIE turns and goes quickly , as the BOSS keeps chewing bread ) QUEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Looking around from one to the other ) The truth ? QUEEN If you know the truth , sir . WRECKING CREW BOSS I know , Queen . The King came by as we stopped for coffee and cigarettes this afternoon . He said he would make us laugh  --  for a coin . And my men said , Why , we 're laughing all the time , make us weep , and you 'll have a lot of coins . And he worked , and worked well , and all we did was laugh  --  all except one , Queen , that I know of  --  myself ! One who wept bitterly from the beginning of the great Clown 's work to the end of it , and fell to the bottom of his soul with grief and admiration at the Clown 's refusal of our coins , and the forefeiture of his shoe . Myself , and more than likely Jamie , too . ( Pause ) And more than likely each of the others , too , each of us unwilling , Queen , unwilling to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father . That is why . p. 68 QUEEN I thought it was for the child . WRECKING CREW BOSS No . I have my own , know them and love them and under-stand them , and do n't understand them , and probably never will . It is for the Father . The King . The Madman . The Clown . The Father of the Child . ( He gets up suddenly , speaks softly ) I must go along here now and study the problem . ( He goes . The GIRL looks around at everybody , goes to the BEAR , rests her head on his shoulder , then turns and runs out ) FATHER ( Shouts ) Gorky , I wish you 'd stop liking only pretty girls ! p. 69 Act 2 , Scene 6 Scene 6 Early Monday morning . The FATHER is up . The MOTHER is up . The CHILD is in her arms . The BEAR is waiting . The family suitcase is packed . The QUEEN is up . The KING is up . Everybody is doing little things in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages . KING Well , Queen . QUEEN Yes , King . KING Monday . QUEEN Yes , Monday . The first day of the week . KING And the last day of the World . QUEEN Oh , stop . KING Do you know it 's the name of the theatre , actually ? I found out only yesterday , out front . QUEEN I had no idea . In any case , you 've got both your shoes , and I 've got all my things . KING And we 've eaten well these past few days . QUEEN Yes , we have . KING There 's another theatre that 's been dark for years . ( Points ) A little up , and east . p. 70 QUEEN Oh , no , no . KING Where , then ? QUEEN Where all the others are . I do n't mind . KING Alone ? QUEEN What a strange question , King . What a strange word . Who can be alone ? KING You can . I 've seen you alone when I 've been right beside you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING Well , let me carry your bundle until you 're there , at any rate . I 've nothing of my own to carry . QUEEN ( Sweetly ) Would you ? Just until I 'm there ? ( KING smiles ) I 've never understood such places too well . Where they are , and how one obtains entrance . KING It 's the same with me , of course , but I 'll ask , and we 'll find out . FATHER You 're both welcome to come with us . QUEEN You 're very kind . Oh , no , thank you . MOTHER We 'll do very well . I know we will . There will be plenty for all of us , and we need your help . KING The Duke might have learned to wrestle the Bear , or the other way around . p. 71 FATHER Yes , yes , that would have helped a lot . KING ( Looks up and all around ) Well ( Footsteps are heard , and then a knock at the door . The KING opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and behind him the SILENT BOY . They come in ) DUKE ( Looks around , nodding to each ) Well , here he is . Where 's the Girl ? QUEEN She left soon after you did . She went out to find you . DUKE I 've been looking for this Boy . He ca n't speak , but he can understand , and I 've told him the Girl loves him . QUEEN Boy ? Do you love the Girl ? ( The BOY looks at the DUKE , then back at the QUEEN , then nods one nod ) Well , she 's been gone for several days now . But she 's some-where about . Look for her . You 'll find her . Because she 'll be looking for you . ( The CREW BOSS comes in , walking slowly and thoughtfully , followed by JAMIE , with papers in his hands : charts , floor plans , and so on . The BOSS nods at everybody , looks up at the problem . He looks at his watch ) p. 72 KING We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much . WRECKING CREW BOSS ( Goes to the KING , looks at him intently ) Good luck , Father . Good luck , all . ( He and JAMIE go ) FATHER ( To the DUKE ) Join us . We need you . We 'll be working the streets at first , but soon we 'll get to the circus , I 'm sure . ( The DUKE thinks about this , but does not reply . The FATHER and MOTHER smile at the others awkwardly , and nod , and the FATHER unloosens the BEAR 'S chain . They begin to go ) QUEEN Oh ( The MOTHER stops ) May I have one last look at the child , please ? ( The MOTHER hurries to the QUEEN , who looks intently at the CHILD , then nods , and the FATHER and the BEAR and the MOTHER go , all of them waving , including the BEAR ) DUKE ( Looks around , bewildered because the GIRL is gone . He looks up . The SILENT BOY nods , and turns to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . They all wait in silence . The GIRL comes in through the open door ) p. 73 GIRL I 've come back for my man , if he 'll have me . ( The DUKE turns and looks at her . The GIRL runs to his arms . The DUKE puts one hand at the back of her neck )
