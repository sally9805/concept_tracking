The President of the U.S. came before the people this week in an effort to dispel fear . Over a nationwide radio and TV network , he calmly ticked off the misgivings of his countrymen and presented his Government 's solutions to them . <P> The hydrogen bomb , he said , is " merely a dramatic symbol " of the nation 's fears . " None of the questions that bother us today has an easy answer , and many of them have no answers at all , at least in their complete sense . " The answer to these problems is to approach them as the average family does . An American family " meets its problems courageously . It does n't get panicky . It solves these problems with what I call courage and faith , but above all by cooperation . . . Now the problems of America are the family problems multiplied a millionfold . . . The greater any of these apprehensions , the greater is the need that we look at them clearly , face to face , without fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not develop the jitters or any kind of panic , that we do not fall prey to hysterical thinking . " <P> The First Fear . The men in the Kremlin , said the President , may start an atomic war . The best way to still that apprehension is to consider the position of the men of the Kremlin . " The very fact that those men by their own design are in the Kremlin means that they love power . They want to be there . Whenever they start a war . they are taking the great risk of losing that power . . . When dictators overreach themselves and challenge the whole world , they are very likely to end up in any place except a dictatorial position , and those men in the Politburo know that . ' ' <P> Nevertheless , said the President , " I admit that there remains a possibility they might start a war in a fit of madness or through miscalculation . " Of all the factors that inhibit them , none is greater than their knowledge of " the retaliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack any of our nations or any part of our vital interests . " <P> The Second Fear . Next on the President 's list was Communist infiltration . " It would be completely false , " he said , " to minimize the danger of this penetration . It does exist . " But " this fear has been greatly exaggerated as to numbers . " <P> The Third Fear . There is another fear " that we will use intemperate investigative methods , particularly through congressional committees , to combat that Communist penetration . " But " in this country , public opinion is the most powerful of all forces , and it will straighten this matter out wherever and whenever there is real violence done to our people . " <P> The Fourth Fear . Another thing that is nagging Americans , said Ike , is the fear of losing allies abroad . There is , he recognized , one real menace to international friendships : " The one mistake we must never make is to think of our friends . . . as being tools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , and if they are not friends , they are useless to us. "
