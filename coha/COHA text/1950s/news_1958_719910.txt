Wilson White to be head of the civil rights division of the Justice Department , was removed when the Senate voted 56 to 20 to confirm him . Also passed by the Senate was a major farm bill permitting reductions in price supports for cotton , corn and rice and delaying scheduled sharp cutbacks in planting allotments for cotton and rice . Benson Backs Bill The Senate action on the farm bill was taken by voice vote after brief debate .

The housing measure was brought up under a suspension of House rules requiring a twothirds vote for passage . It received a favorable vote of 251 to .134 . However , the vote was seventeen shy of the necessary two-thirds . The defeat of the measure made it likely that no further attempt would be made to pass a housing bill in this session of Congress . Called Inflationary The defeated bill , opposed as inflationary by the Administration and by Republican House leaders , would have provided a $400,000,000 one-year program for slum clearance and urban renewal .

Representative Leslie C. Arends of Illinois , the Republican whip , complained that the Speaker was " virtually asking us to act on thirty-five bills , without our being able to say anything or propose anything . " " These measures are ? of great importance , " Representative Arends said . " In dollars alone they involve almost- $3 , - 000,000,000 as a cost to the people we represeni . " Speaker Rayburn told reporters before the opening of today 's session that there was nothing , unusual about the procedure , which is permissible under House rules on the first and third Mondays of each month.I Both Speaker Rayburn and Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , Senate Democratic leader , continued to fend off inquiries as to when Congress might actually expect to adjourn . Mr. Rayburn said that much work remained to be done . He implied that most of it was in the Senate . Sentaor Johnson said that the situation was so delicate there that " if anybody sneezes real hard I may have to revise my schedule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensational progress in the first hour or two of its session today . Upward of 100 bills were whipped through in jigtime . Unfortunately they did not include the major bills that could delay adjournment .

Hutcheson , international president of the Carpenters UniOn In addition , the Senate passed a resolution approving the socalled Euratom agreement on atomic development in Western Europe , and a bill to make available $328,000,000 of American assistance to the six-nation atomic pool . Both measures go to the House . The House Rules Committee in a five-minute session removed an obstacle to the aidto-science education bill . It voted to let the measure go to a joint Senate-House conference to resolve differences . A Senate-House conference on the $1,118,000,000 public works appropriations bill reached agreement on the measure , which now must be approved by both Houses .

After the passage of the farm bill , Mr. Benson expressed his pleasure . He Er.id that the bill " contains many forward-looking provisions which will give our nation 's farmers and ranchers more freedom to plant , to market , to compete and ' ) make their own decisions . " The bill will allow minimum price supports ( the present minimum is 75 per cent of parity ) to drop as low as 65 per cent for corn next year and for rice and cotton in 1962 . This would be the lowest level for corn since 1939 and for cotton since 1940 . Cotton this year is being supported at 81 per cent of parity , corn at 77 per cent and rice at 75 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 75 to 90 per cent of parity depending on the supplies of these  --  basic crops .
