txt The plan to send a substantial military mission to Formosa to supervise the use of American aid and to assist in-some technical fields is part of the implementation of a fundamentally sound policy . It does not mean that the United States is underwriting an expedition to the Chinese mainland by the Nationalist forces . It does mean that the United States recognizes that those forces are on our side and should be strengthened accordingly . General has laid great stress on the strategic importance of . Formosa . Part of that importance lies in thee fact that Formosa is the base of the largest mobilized antiCommunist Military force of Asians . What is to be done with that force is a matter for political as well as military decisions . But in any event , if the present conflict is enlarged , through an initiative other than ours , we will be grateful for that force . It is good sense , therefore , to make it stronger than it is and to sustain it . It haa been repeatedly declared that we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asians . But Communist Asians may have to be fought if free Asians are to remain free . Obviously the vanguard in such a fight should be the free Asians themselves . They are our allies and we will do wisely and well to hold up their hands . There are five important groups of those allies now in Asia . First in size is the group of mobilized free Chinese on Formosa , and we are taking action to assist them . First in possible potential , especially industrially , are the free Japanese . The peace treaty will have to make provision for their right to defend their freedom , and they have indicated their willingness to be aligned with us in its defense . That may seem a strange role for our recent enemy , but it fits the facts in the case . The next body of our allies is the gallant Filipinos . General put their case in two sentences when he said to the Congress : " Of our former ward , the Philippines , we can look forward with confidence that the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will grow in the longer aftermath of war 's terrible destructiveness . We must be patient and understanding and never fail them , as in our hour of need they did not fail us . " Our help to the Philippines should be virtually automatic , since we- are proved comrades in a good cause . A further group of these allies is in Indo-China . The French have recognized that it will be impossible for the Republic of Vietnam to defend itself against the Communist onslaught without strong forces of Vietnamese . It is a hard job to recruit and train enough of them in a hurry , but vigorous efforts are being made . The United States is joining in those efforts by supplying.a certain amount of equipment that would not otherwise be available . Trained and equipped , these Vietnamese will be good soldiers , and they are on freedom 's side . The fifth force is in the hills of China . More ' news of fresh purges and mass murders by Peiping indicates that the spirit of resistance in China is by no means crushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , in counter-revolution , and those who are resisting the Communists will be in the thick of it . At present they are scattered and of varying degrees of effectiveness . They are little organized . at this stage and not yet formidable . Nevertheless , it is certainly the part 4 wisdom to do what can be done to kee contacts with as many of them as pm sible and , above all , to let them lEno that they are not forgotten . For the : also , are on freedom 's side . There has been too much defeath talk about how we have lost prestig and forfeited friendship in Asia . W still have friends , and they are faithft and courageous . We can keep Utz friendship if we do our part . Our pai is to make . those strong who wish t remain free . That is what a missio for Formosa means . That is what ur , derlies a just peace for Japan . That i the basis for much more help for th Philippines . It is the reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should not forget our friend on the mainland of China and shoul do what we can so that they will no forget us.
