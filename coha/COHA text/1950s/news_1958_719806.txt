txt The Administration , for reasons of economy , has drastically curtailed construction of research facilities for the Atomic Energy Commission . As a result , the commission will be unable to begin work on new laboratories and research facilities that scientists in the laboratories and the commission feel are necessary to advance United States knowledge of nuclear energy . In addition to blocking new ' projects , the Administration has been holding up some of the money appropriated by Congress in the last two years for research facilities . ? Congressmen Critical The Administration 's action is under critical review by the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy . As it drafts a construction authorization bill for the coming year , the committee is likely to reinstate many of the projects eliminated by the Administration . Committee pemocrats feel strongly that the Administration 's failure to support expanded basic research is a shortsighted , false economy that will have the eventual result of relegating the United States to second place behind the Soviet Union in the field of nuclear energy . The Democrats ' attitude was summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Illinois and chairman of the Atomic Energy Subcommittee on Research and Development . Mr. Price accused the Administration of paying " lip service " to the importance of basic research , but of following " a negative approach " when it came to adequate financial support . Some of the research projects were believed to have been re // stored today by a subcommittee drafting the construction authorization bill for the coming fiscal year , beginning July 1 . The details of the bill approved by the subcommittee were being kept secret until the legislation can be presented to the full committee next Tuesday . Plutonium . Plan Reported Aside from the new research prokcts , however ; it was reporfed that the subcommittee bill provided for construction of a new plutonium-producing reactor at a cost of $145,000,000 . Basic research was one of the major points emphasized by President Eisenhower in his two " chins up " speeches following the launching of the first two Soviet satellites . In his speech Nov. 13 he said that " wise investment in such facilities as laboratories and high-energy accelerators can greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months the Administration has increased the basic budgets of several Government agencies , including the National Science Foundation and the Defense ' Department . ' But the commission 's basic research program still seems to be circumscribed . Strauss Explains This was indicated in a June 5 letter from Lewis L. Strauss , commission chairman , to the committee explaining why the research construction program had been so drastically curtailed . Mr. Strauss pointed out that it was Administration policy " to defer all but the most essential projects . " Under this economy edict , the total of eighteen construction projects proposed by the commission 's research division was cut to five by the commission M submitting its budget for the coming fiscal year . The Budget Bureau approved only three projects . A total of $57,200,000 was proposed by the research division . This was cut to . $10,900,000 by the commission and ' to ' $2 , - 500,000 by the Budget Bureau . Of the $2,500,000 finally , included in the commission 's budget for research facilities , $1,500,000 is for minor improvements to various existing facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between additions to a research reactor at the Argonne National , Laboratoryin Illinois and improvements of , existing accelerators at the University of California . One of the projects eliminated was $900,000 for a new physics research building at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on , Long Island . The commission 's research division pointed out that the present buildings were in " a serious state of deterioration . " At the request of the Administration , Congress in 1957 appropriated $2,140,000 for the Brookhaven building . These funds have never been released by the Budget Bureau , nor has $9,000,000 for four other research projects . Many Projects Eliminated Other new projects eliminated were : $3,000,000 for the cyclotron at the University of California Radiation Laboratory ; $3,500,000 for a research laboratory addition at Oak Ridge National Laboratory ; $900,000 for expansion of isotope production capacity at Oak Ridge ; $500,000 for a high-energy physics building at Columbia University ; $1,300,000 for a particle accelerator at Cambridge , Mass. ; $10,000,000 for a high-flux research reactor at Brookhaven , and $9,700,000 for a research and engineering reactor at Argonne .

The Administration now has boosted the research budget to $90,000,000 . Anderson Offers Plan A program to speed the development of atomic power- in the United States was outlined here last night by Senator Clinton P. Anderson , vice chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy . He suggested , a system of capital subsidies to private utilities and an extension of reactor development for public and cooperative systems . He spoke at a dinner of the Nuclear . Energy Writers Association at the Yale Club , Fortyfourth Street and Vanderbilt Avenue . Grants to private operators might be up , to 90 per cent of the difference between cost of a nuclear power plant and a conventional plant of the same output , he said . He suggested that . the assistance to public and cooperative power groups be on the basis of the commission being responsible for construction and ownership of . the reactor and the public body responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
