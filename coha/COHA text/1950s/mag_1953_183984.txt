On the question of segregation in Southern public schools , Editor Ralph McGill of the influential Atlanta Constitution ( circ. 173,591 ) has long steered an enlightened but discreet course . But last week , in his daily column , McGill spoke bluntly . " What the various Southern state legislatures are doing , " said he , " as they busy themselves with plans to carry on school segregation without legal compulsion , is admitting that segregation by law is finished ... It , therefore , seems important that we discuss the problem as rationally as possible . <P> " There are those who insist that segregation protects the ' integrity ' of both races . There are others who believe , with deep sincerity , that Negroes are ' better off ' under it . Conceivably this might be argued with some logic . It does not matter . The world , in the throes of a social revolution which began with the coming of the industrial revolution , and which was tremendously accelerated by two great world wars , has moved on . Segregation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " As a matter of fact , segregation has been on its way out for a good long time . . . Two great forces have been at work on ... the problem of race . One is secular , the other religious . The Christian of today can not help but wince at the full implications , and the jarring clash of his creed , with discrimination against any person because of color . To send missionaries to colored peoples and then to argue that because of the color of skin the two may not . . . worship the same God together is an impossible contradiction . <P> " It is this very fact which causes our Communist enemies to be able to present us in a bad light before the Oriental and Asiatic peoples . They can say . . . that our claims to Christian brotherhood and democracy are hypocritically untrue . Christianity can not well afford to be on the wrong side of a moral force . <P> " The other influence is secular . Segregation implies inferiority . . . Across two great wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached the rights of men everywhere to be free and equal-we have encouraged long-oppressed peoples to rise . They have done so , and to date the Communists , with great shrewdness , have exploited successfully many of these nationalistic revolutions . <P> " An end to segregation-when it comes - will not , of course , force people to associate socially . . . But it will bring on change . . . Segregation is on its way out , and he who tries to tell the people otherwise does them great disservice . The problem of the future is how to live with the change .
