Shortly after Prime Minister Nehru 's visit last fall to the drowsy Indo-Chinese countries of Laos and Cambodia , a British diplomat hopefully remarked that " this could be Nehru 's Rubicon , the point where he must finally choose sides . " Reason : Nehru was so deeply impressed by the extensive influence of Indian culture in both countries , as well as their real independence from French colonialism , that he decided on diplomatic recognition and personally appealed to Communist Boss Ho Chi Minh in neighboring North Viet Nam not to violate their frontiers . <P> Ho promised Nehru solemnly that he would never dream of such a dreadful thing , proceeded forthwith to violate a frontier . The Communist Pathet Lao regime , which had grabbed some 13,000 sq . mi. of northern Laos in flagrant violation of the Geneva cease-fire agreements , began as a Viet Minh appendage . In the past year Ho 's agents have built it up into a tightly disciplined Communist state , complete with full-dress government ministries , a capital at Samneua , brainwashing squads and a conscripted army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.500 or more regular Viet Minh troops masquerading as Laotians . <P> Pathet Lao units , sometimes in regimental strength , have repeatedly attacked isolated outposts of the royal Laotian army ( TIME . July 25 ) . Communist food seizures , for shipment to Ho 's hungry Red River Delta , have created such widespread famine that the U.S. International Cooperation Administration this month began air-dropping 1,000 tons of rice to the 100,000 peasants who inhabit the region . Even the International Control Commission , made up of representatives of Canada . India and Communist Poland - with its Polish members dissenting-has complained of Pathet Lao activities . <P> From his capital at Vientiane , Premier Katay Sasorith has tried fruitlessly to negotiate with the Pathet Lao. appealed to world opinion , even threatened to order his U.S.-equipped army of 30,000 to liquidate the Communists-only to be restrained in this by the U.S. and others who feared that Ho might retaliate in force from across the border . <P> Last week , on a formal visit to New Delhi . Katay accused the Viet Minh of outright aggression , bluntly reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there was competition between India and China ... We look to you today for help . " In effect , he was challenging Nehru to invoke his old promise from Ho Chi Minh . Nehru simply said : " It 's for the people of Laos to solve their own problems , not for others to interfere too much , " and offered to help arrange further negotiations between the legal government and the Red interlopers.
