txt 6,500 ARE DELAYED TAKING NEW HOMES Long Island Buyers Held Up in Occupancy by N.P.A. Cut in Utility Installations By JOHN P. CALLAHAN The full impact of materials shortages struck Long Island yesterday , when 11,800 families that have bought new homes in Nassau and Suffolk counties learned that their dates of occupancy may be advanced as long as a year . The crisis arose from an order of the National Production Authority that directed the Long Island Lighting Company to cut its monthly average of electric service installations in new homes from 3,500 to 1,000 to conserve supplies of copper , a strategic war metal . The most immediate and severe effect of the directive was to leave about 6,500 families with no place to go for several weeks . About that many expected to move into their new dwellings within a week , and it was on that expectation that they arranged to vacate their present quarters . There are few cases where they can stay on indefinitely due to the fact that landlords of the houses being vacated quickly arrange to lease such quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to result for many of the 6,500 families , particularly those who purchased homes in the low-priced ( $6,500 to $7,500 ) range and who can not afford to maintain their families at hotels . Other homes cost as high as $30,000 . The second group of new home owners affected comprises the balance of 5,300 families that planned to occupy their new houses within sixty days . Here , too , hardship is expected unless immediate relief is // granted to the utility company by the N. P. A. In a move to have the Federal controls agency 's order eased , the Long Island Lighting Company appealed to the N. P. A , on Wednesday . Last night- , J. W. Carpenter , a vice president of the utility , said he was waiting " momentarily for favorable word from Washington . " Early action also was asked for by the Long Island Home Builders Institute , Inc. , representing 660 builders , or almost all of the organized home constructors on the Island . Otto J. Hartwig , executive secretary of the institute , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became effective this year , while the houses were started , and all but completed , in 1950 . The first order on copper restrictions was issued Nov. 29 and the second on Dec. 30 , the latter giving the order full force . At a meeting of the institute on Wednesday night at the Stewart Manor Country Club , Stewart Manor , L. I. , 330 of its members voted to try to mitigate the drastic effect on home building by seeking from the Government a defense plant housing allotment . This , in effect , would give builders permission to construct homes for defense workers in war plants on the Island , without materials restrictions . It was also learned last night that Samuel Levin , chairman of the institute 's committee on scarce materials , and Fred W. Jackson , another member who also is an assistant vice president of the Dime Savings Bank , had discussed the plight of the hoine buyers with N. P. A. officials in Washington and that some early relief ? was expected . The form of that relief , which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an increase in the rate of home electric service installations from the reduced figure of 1,000 . The Dime Savings Bank is the largest lender of mortgage money on Long Island , Mr. Hartwig said . An ironic phase of the crisis , according to another spokesman for Long Island Lighting , was that the utility company " has plenty of copper on hand . " He estimated the supply was sufficient for sixty days . Among the steps that the utility company is taking to relieve the situation , are : 1 . Scheduling of all new jobs so tha ' applicants will have approximate dates of service . 2 . Application to N. P. A. for exemption on the use of copper . 3 . Application for special permits on copper for major construction projects , such as high tension lines 4 . Advising builders on the copper situation from week to week , 5 . Notifying prospective occupants of new houses of the exact nature of the problem . 6 . Making extensions for new street lighting units after homes are connected . The Long Island utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens , and in Nassau and Suffolk Counlines.
