Zesty as a two-year-old rounding into the stretch , Britain 's aged Prime Minister Winston Churchill last week entered his 79th year enthusiastically agallop on all his old hobbies . Unlike his gelding Non-Stop , which won only second place in the races at Kempton Park on the eve of his birthday , the Old Warrior himself spent the week in top form , smiting parliamentary enemies with one hand and holding the shredded remnants of a vanished empire together with the other . He did admit that several American admirers had been sending him rejuvenating pills , but " I do n't take them , " he said . " Think how unfair that would be to Anthony . " * <P> The battle in Parliament began when Laborite Emanuel Shinwell , onetime Minister of Defense , asked archly why the Prime Minister could n't make up his mind about who should command NATO 's navies in the Mediterranean . Churchill querulously retorted that things " may not all be as unfortunate for this country as Mr. Shinwell would no doubt wish . " " Withdraw ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patriotism , but the Prime Minister 's dander was up . Instead of withdrawing , he recklessly peppered the air with further opprobrium : an ambiguous reference to " cosmopolitanism , " which is a word the Kremlin likes to hurl at Jews . Laborites booed and hissed as Churchill started to stride out of the House . " Is it in order to boo a member of this House ? " he demanded truculently . A scathing Scottish voice gave his answer : " What else can you say to a goose ? " Now came cries from the Tory side , demanding the withdrawal of the remark . But Churchill said : " I do not in the least mind being called a goose . " <P> Next day , he was Britain 's confident lion , meeting with eight Commonwealth Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers who had come to London to discuss the problem of how to strengthen the pound sterling. * As banker for the whole Commonwealth , he had good news for them : a sterling area solidly in the black last November , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news was tempered with a startling announcement . To keep the recovery solid , said Churchill , Britain has decided to slash its defense spending by as much as 29% in the next two years ; the original three-year rearmament program would now take up to five years . That announcement , made to Parliament by a less forceful Prime Minister , might well have rocked the nation 's confidence . Secure at 78 in his role of jealous guardian of the nation 's security , Winston Churchill made the announcement without a question from any member in the House . <P> <P> *Heir Apparent Eden , now 55 . <P> *On his doodling pad , Australian Prime Minister Menzies put the problem thus : With singular agility And technical facility We seek convertibility Which means ( I 'll have you know ) A quid for every quo.
