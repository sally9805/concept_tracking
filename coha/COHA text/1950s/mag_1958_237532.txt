As Turkish baths go , the establishment beneath London 's Imperial Hotel in Russell Square is one of the best . From its Gothic galleries , stone monarchs and prophets ( Queen Elizabeth I , Erasmus ) have gazed through the steam at generations of bare , Blimpish backsides . One night last week the steam rooms and massage parlors presented a shocking sight : crowds of people who were fully dressed , or almost . To celebrate the London premiere of Auntie Mame , starring Bea Lillie , Producer David Pelham had picked the Turkish bath as the logical place for a party . The result was as wacky a shindig as any the Madwoman of Beekman Place herself might have improvised . <P> Great blocks of ice were brought in to cool the pool , and enough pent-up steam was allowed to escape into the London air to sweat out a whole year 's hangovers . The cavernous chambers were abustle with well-stacked nautch girls , brushing bare bellies with Indian waiters serving cha-patties . The only washroom was carefully labeled " Co-educational-On Your Honor Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful stream at a stone death 's head that looked like many a guest would feel on the morning after . There were two dozen freshly made beds spotted strategically for the incapable or the incautious . <P> While a six-piece combo whanged away , dukes and duchesses danced alongside Douglas Fairbanks Jr . and Hollywood 's Mike Romanoff . The dueling balletomani-acs , the Marquis de Cuevas and Serge Lifar , were almost friendly , and Angry Young Man John Osborne giggled at the fun . Dame Margot Fonteyn turned up along with Gracie Fields . At midnight , when Bea Lillie , alias Lady Peel , arrived , the party reached its peak . Someone peeled off his dinner jacket ; someone else pushed him into the pool . A fully dressed couple staged an underwater race . The bar closed at 2 a.m. , but 35 cases of whisky , gin , beer , champagne , vodka , sherry had given the party enough momentum to last till 4 . <P> There was only one thing wrong : everyone already knew that the British critics were dismissing Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the party was ( as even the British have learned to say ) socko.
