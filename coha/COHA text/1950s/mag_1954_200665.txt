While China suffered its worst floods in a century ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) , its satellite , Tibet , was suffering too . At the monastic trade center of Shigatse ( pop . 20,000 ) , second-biggest city in Tibet , midsummer torrents had turned the Nyang Chu River into a foaming cataract . Lake Takri Tsoma overflowed and a wall of water swept into Shigatse ( altitude : 12,800 ft. ) . flooding shrines and drowning sacred statues . The flood undermined the ancient Palace of the Western Paradise , official residence of the 16-year-old Panchen Lama , whom 3,000,000 Tibetans accept as a spiritual reincarnation of the Buddha of Boundless Light . Reports reaching West Bengal last week reported that the palace collapsed , crushing scores of Buddhist monks in a welter of prayer wheels , holy vessels and ornamented battlements . One Red Chinese barracks , teeming with the Panchen Lama 's Communist " bodyguards , " reportedly fell apart . Estimated death toll : between 500 and 1,000.               @ @ @ @ @ @
