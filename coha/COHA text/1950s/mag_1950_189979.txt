Anybody but a Communist would have been embarrassed by the Communist invasion of Korea right in the middle of Communism 's trumpeted " World Peace Appeal . " <P> Even the Daily Worker , published in New York , U.S.A. , admitted that some comrades were " confused . " But it briskly set them straight . The North Koreans were not conducting aggression but " a struggle of liberation . " June 26 became " the date Truman ordered the invasion of Korea " and the U.S. effort became " the Wall-Street-conceived and Truman-Dulles-engineered attack on the Korean people . " Every North Korean success was another town " liberated , " every U.S. reverse was gloated over ( " The People 's Army pushed the invading forces back all along the line " ) . Cried the Worker : " Today , under the orders of our Southern President , U.S. planes are bombing and strafing COLORED PEOPLE in Korea . " <P> " Halt the War . " The Worker got its war news from the Moscow and Pyongyang radio , reported solemnly that U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Gus Hall , national secretary of the U.S. Communist Party , announced that the " Hands Off Korea " movement and the peace drive must be " linked . " It promptly was . Orated the Worker : " The world peace movement is mankind 's greatest hope in this hour . It asserts : " Korea for Koreans . . . Is n't it clear there would be no fighting whatsoever in Korea if the U.S. invaders left Korea ? " <P> " Who Is n't for Peace ? " Petition collectors , who had experienced a moment 's dismay , swarmed over the U.S. with renewed zeal . The document they flourished was whomped up at a meeting of a Communist-sponsored something called the " World Committee of Peace Partisans " in Stockholm last March . Innocently worded , it simply condemned atomic bombing as aggression ; it did not mention other kinds of aggression-like the Korean . At ballparks , in subways and factories , on street corners , the partisans solicited signatures . " Who is n't for peace ? I 'll sign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the muddled . Day after day , the Worker whooped it up , ran advertisements ( " The Celebrated Soviet Novelist Alexander Fadeyev Has Signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal " ) . Those who refused to sign were pictured snarling : " No , I do n't want peace ; I 'm a fascist beast . " <P> Workers from party-line unions-the Food , Tobacco and Agricultural Workers , the United Office and Professional Workers , the United Electrical Workers , the Marine Cooks and Stewards-canvassed busily for " peace " signatures . U.A.W. Communists in the big Ford local circulated petitions on the assembly lines . At the Kaiser-Frazer plant , angry U.A.W. unionists flung one peace collector out bodily . Earnest youths turned up on campuses in New York , Chicago and Austin , Texas . In some states , impatient cops , out of sheer exasperation , arrested canvassers on charges of disorderly conduct .
