McCarthy &; the Army <P> Sir : <P> Your reporting on the McCarthy-Army hearings May 3 was superb . As a Democrat , I should rejoice at this sordid spectacle of Republicans belaboring Republicans . But as a loyal American , I can not in my heart find any joy in a fracas which is seriously injuring the prestige of the United States , and keeping the minds of the people and legislators from far more vital affairs . . . <P> ALLEN KLEIN <P> Mount Vernon , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> . . . McCarthy 's blatant disregard for fact , for details of courtesy and procedure , for authority , for his fellow committeemen , high-ranking Government officials and Army officers , let alone millions of televiewers , has been openly exposed to the American public better than ever before . . . <P> JOHN B. BALLOU , M.D. <P> Hartford , Conn . <P> Sir : <P> I wish to express my profound admiration for Secretary of the Army Robert Stevens . . . He has returned courtesy for discourtesy . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , he has preserved his good temper while dealing with bad temper . I do n't see how he did it ! <P> DOROTHY Ross BROWN <P> Grosse Ile , Mich . <P> Sir : <P> ... It is evident that you have not recovered from the Roosevelt brain wash . It is fortunate for objective truth that the majority of the American public are able to watch this investigation first-hand via television , and are not required to depend upon your misinterpretation of the event . <P> HAROLD R. COLLINS <P> Gloucester , Mass . <P> Sir : <P> . . . Truly , the founders of the great United States of America must be turning in their graves to see to what a low ebb have fallen patriotism , honor and dignity . . . Please , please , wash the dirty linen in private ! Remember the high principles upon which your great country was founded . <P> CECIL YOUNG <P> Toronto <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on your last edition : no mention of Porfirio Rubirosa ! When will I congratulate you again for not mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Oppenheimer &; the AEC <P> Sir : <P> Incorrect statements concerning my relations with Dr. Robert Oppenheimer are made in TIME , April 26 . I have known Oppenheimer well since 1926 . I have the highest regard for his scientific ability , his patriotism and his trustworthiness in all respects . . . <P> You were misled by not knowing the background of a private and personal letter to my wife written by me in 1949 . This was " leaked " to the press on April 14 by what news services called a " reliable source . " America 's strength at home and prestige abroad is being damaged by dishonest political attacks on our scientists . I have worked hard to minimize this damage to national security . Under stress of difficult conditions , I was led privately to consider doubts about Oppenheimer which I never stated publicly , which I soon learned were wholly unjustified , and which I now publicly repudiate . <P> Dean Inge once wrote : <P> Lives of great men all remind us , <P> As we o'er their pages turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Letters that we ought to burn . <P> E.
