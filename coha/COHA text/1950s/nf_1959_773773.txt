txt // which connected Albany with Buffalo were combined in 1853 as the New York Central . In 1850 the federal government began to grant land to railroads as a regular policy , in order to encourage the construction of new railroad mileage . The grant in each case consisted of the right of way of the new mileage and alternate sections of land adjoining the right of way on each side . The depth of a section ? that is , the distance from the right of way to the far side of the section ? varied from one line to another . The first grants were 6 miles in depth . Later grants extended various distances up to about 24 miles . If some of the land was already privately owned , the railroad was given other sections instead , selected by the railroad within certain distances from the right of way . The total amount of land granted to the railroads exceeded 200,000 square miles , which is considerably greater than the area of California . The railroads sold most of the land . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally be given , only in the sparsely settled areas where the government was the principal land owner . It was therefore confined to railroads in the neighborhood of the Mississippi River ( Illinois Central got the first land grant ) and farther west . Large quantities of land went to such railroads as the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific . The latter alone received more than 64,000 square miles . The federal government attached important conditions to the land grants . Under these conditions , the railroads had to carry government traffic at approximately half the regular rates . These land-grant rates remained in effect until discontinued by acts of Congress in 1940 and 1945 ( effective 1946 ) , respectively ; the former act applied to mail and other civil traffic , and the latter applied to military and naval traffic . // Although government aid was important , it was chiefly the physical or technological advantage of the railroads that caused their rise to dominance . By the time of the Civil War , they had clearly outstripped the other modes of transportation . Wagoning could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1854 , for example , when the average railroad freight charge per ton-mile on important routes varied from about 2 cents to about 33 cents , transportation by wagon appears to have cost approximately 15 cents per ton-mile . Transportation by water provided much more stubborn resist-ance to the railroads . Indeed , in the 1830 's and early 1840 's many if not most people thought of the railroads primarily as a means of feeding and connecting the waterways . In the 1850 's rail transportation pushed ahead of inland-waterway transportation in spite of the fact that the average rail charges were higher than those of carriers by water for similar distances . Thus in 1854 , when the railroad averages ranged roughly from 2 cents to 3% cents per ton-mile , the average charge for transportation on the Erie Canal was about 1 cent per ton-mile . On the Great Lakes and on the Mississippi River it was even lower than 1 cent . But rail transportation was generally faster and , more important , the railroads could go where there were no navigable waterways . INLAND TRANSPORTATION FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the railroads . After the Civil War the railroad industry 's position in American transportation became even more dominant . Railroad construction , which had slowed up during the war period , moved ahead faster than ever before . The nation was growing and the railroads were keeping pace . Sometimes , indeed , they more than kept pace and their overexpansion helped to precipitate financial crises ( 1873 , 1893 ) . An especially important event in the building of the railroads took place in 1869 . In that year , helped by federal land grants , // the first transcontinental line of railroad , extending from the midwest to the Pacific coast , was completed . From then on , goods and persons could be moved by rail all the way across the continent . By the early 1870 's it was clear that the railroad industry could expand rapidly without government aid . Accordingly , Congress made no more land grants to railroads after 1871 . The years 1850-1871 are sometimes called the land-grant period in railroad history . Also , in the 1870 's and 1880 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed as a result of questionable financial practices by railroad promoters . Some railroads , for example , were impelled by their promoters to enter into over-liberal contracts with construction companies owned by the promoters themselves . Thus the promoters got rich at the expense of other railroad investors . Railroads made themselves even more unpopular by their discriminatory practices . In order to obtain , or perhaps to retain , the business of a large shipper for whose traffic a water carrier or another railroad was competing , a railroad would sometimes charge the large shipper a lower rate than it charged smaller shippers . It was also a common practice for a railroad to charge a lower rate on a long , competitive haul ? that is , a long haul between points connected by two or more railroads or by both railroads and water carriers ? than on a shorter haul where the railroad had a monopoly . Although the railroads contended that the practice was forced upon them by the need to hold their own in the long-haul competition , this long-and-short-haul discrimination naturally antagonized the short-haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . But discrimination , rather than high rates in themselves , was the greatest source of dissatisfaction . // As a consequence of these and other railroad practices , the public 's attitude toward the railroads changed . Previously it had been an attitude of strong support tempered by criticism . Within a few years after the Civil War it became one of fear , resentment , and retaliation . Several states passed laws to prevent objectionable railroad practices . But interstate shipments ? those going from one state into another ? were becoming more and more important in the transportation picture , and the states had no constitutional power to regulate rates which were charged for them . Accordingly , Congress in 1887 passed the Act to Regulate Commerce , known since 1920 as the Interstate Commerce Act . Among other things , this law forbade unjust discrimination on interstate hauls and set up a federal agency , the Interstate Commerce Commission , to administer the provisions of the act . One of the provisions was apparently intended to give the commission power to place a ceiling on interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A court decision , however , interpreted the provision otherwise , and so Congress passed an amendment ( 1906 ) to the Act , clearly and definitely giving the commission the important power , which it has had ever since , to prescribe maximum interstate rates . The 1880 's . Passage of the Interstate Commerce Act was only one of the great events to take place in the most important decade in railroad history . Here are six railroad accomplishments of major significance occurring in the 1880 's : 1 . About 75,000 miles were added to the American railroad system . This is more than one-third of the nation 's entire present railroad mileage . 2 . The gauge ? that is , the distance between the two rails of a track ? was standardized at 4 feet , 8 ' 2 inches . Different railroads had been built with at least 23 different gauges , of which the one finally adopted as standard had been the most common . // Uniformity of gauge permitted cars to be interchanged among railroads throughout the nation . Thus it greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interline shipments ? that is , shipments moving over more than one railroad . 3 . The air brake was introduced on freight trains . This made it possible for relatively long trains and heavy loads to be moved with reasonable safety . Although required by law in 1893 , airbraking was not universally adopted until some 20 years later . 4 . Steel rails replaced iron rails on most of the nation 's track . Although introduced in the 1860 's , steel rails in 1880 were in use on less than one-third of the railroad system . By 1890 they had replaced iron rails on about four-fifths of the system . Stronger and more durable than iron rails , they permitted greater speeds and heavier loads , and thus tended to reduce costs . 5 . In 1883 the railroads introduced the standard 4-zone ( Pacific , Mountain , Central , Eastern ) time system , which was consequently adopted throughout the nation . Previously there had been a lack of uniformity from city to city and from railroad to railroad . Trains had been operated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several additional routes to the Pacific were completed , the first since the initial transcontinental route in 1869 . The economies resulting from some of the innovations ( the ones numbered 2 , 3 , and 4 ) contributed , along with other technological advances , increased traffic , and the downward trend of the general price level , to enable the railroads to reduce their rates until they were taking in less than one cent of revenue per ton-mile . In 1900 the average railroad revenue per ton-mile was 0.729 cents . Then , with technological progress slowing up and the general price level rising , costs and rates increased . In 1920 the average revenue per ton-mile was 1.069 cents . // By about 1890 the skeleton or major lines of the nation 's railroad system had been pretty nearly completed . Additional construction , largely branch lines and feeder systems , continued at a lively pace , however , until the time of World War I. The alltime peak mileage of about 254,000 was attained in 1916 . Other modes of inland transportation . Throughout the period between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little challenge to the railroads by any other mode of transportation . Only in special cases were inland waterways able to compete favorably in the light of the increased economy of rail transportation . The effect on the Erie Canal was such that in 1882 the State of New York stopped charging tolls . The very low cost of transportation on the Great Lakes , however , and their happy location betwen iron-ore and coal regions , made the Lakes a continually vital part of the nation 's transportation system . This was less of an exception to railroad domination than may at first appear , for some of the railroads obtained control of carriers on the Great Lakes . There was also some railroad control of ocean transportation . Although the railroad industry thus came close to complete domination , there were signs in the early 1900 's that this condition would not last . Gasoline automobiles had begun to appear in the 1890 's . A movement for better roads was under way . The first airplane flight took place in 1903 . Oil pipelines were not new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early 1900 's their mileage was notably increasing , thus presaging the rapid development of pipeline construction and transportation that was to come after World War I. A crusade to conserve our natural resources had got under way and was turning public attention to the desirability of projects for flood control and navigational improvement on our inland waterways . Of greater immediate importance was the // passage of a law making it unlawful for a railroad to have any interest ( after July 1 , 1914 ) in a vessel or a carrier by water with which it did or might compete , except in special cases approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission . Thus it broke up railroad control of carriers on the Great Lakes . The obvious purpose of the law was to give the public the advantage of competition between railroads and water carriers . MARITIME TRANSPORTATION PRIOR TO WORLD WAR I Improvements . A number of innovations in the 1800 's combined to reduce greatly the cost and the over-all time of oceantransportation service . Outstanding among these were the replacement of wooden ships by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for certain trades , the construction of the Suez Canal . Commercial sailing vessels did not give way to the steamships without a struggle . Indeed , the best of the celebrated American clipper ships were built in the years beginning with 1843 and extending into the 1860 's , although regular transatlantic steamship service had been initiated by the British in 1838 . One of the clippers is known to have sailed 485 miles in a day ? an average of 20.2 miles per hour , or 1Th knots , which is faster than the cruising speed of most cargo ships today . But their speed was still dependent on the wind , and it was achieved by a construction design ( long and narrow ) that sacrificed cargo space . By the time of the Civil War it was clear to almost everyone that the commercial sailing vessel could not compete favorably with the steamship 's superior capacity ( making for lower costs ) and reliability . The slowness of some American shipping interests to recognize this fact many years earlier doubtless hastened the long decline of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Suez Canal ( 1869 ) promoted transportation between Europe and the Far East by reducing the distance of voyages and therefore also their cost and time . The distance between Liverpool and Bombay , for example , was cut by 4,541 miles . Partly as a result of the reduction in transportation cost , the prices in Europe of Asiatic products went down and a substantial market for them was established . The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 was important for both international and domestic transportation . With regard to the latter , the canal shortened the voyage distance between the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the United States by about 8,000 miles and thus helped water transportation to compete with the railroads for transcontinental traffic . So eager was Congress to promote this competition that , in the law ( already referred to ) forbidding railroads to control water transportation with which they might compete , the Interstate Commerce Commission was not permitted to make exceptions in the case of transportation through the Panama Canal . American maritime policy . Prior to the Civil War two basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in effect . One is the rule , established by Congress in 1789 , that only ships built in the United States can be registered as American vessels . An American citizen or company can buy a ship constructed abroad , but can not fly it under the American flag . When iron ships began to replace wooden ships American shipbuilders were at a disadvantage , for they could not build iron ships at so low a cost as the British . American vessel operators were forbidden by the 1789 rule to buy British vessels for American registry . Accordingly , if they wanted to buy new ships , they had to pay higher prices than their foreign competitors did . This is another of the reasons for the decline in the American merchant marine that began in the 1850's. // The second principle , established by statute in 1817 , forbids vessels of foreign registry to operate in the United States coastal trade . As the coasts of United States territory expanded , so did the application of this rule . Only an American-flag vessel , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hawaii . As a consequence of this protection against foreign competition , the American domestic fleet fared somewhat better than the American foreign-trade fleet . When World War I began , almost 90% of the American merchant fleet was engaged in domestic service . TRANSPORTATION SINCE WORLD WAR I New attitude toward the railroads . Because congestion on the railroads threatened to hamper the war effort , the United States government took over the operation of the railroads at the close of 1917 . Federal operation ended in 1920 and at the same time Congress enacted far-reaching amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act . Some of these amendments reflected a partial change in public attitude toward the railroad industry . Previously the act had sought only to restrain the railroads , chiefly by provisions designed to prevent discrimination and unreasonably high rates . But by 1920 it was thought that the railroad industry needed to be strengthened as well as restrained . The war had emphasized the nation 's dependence on a strong railroad industry , and the industry 's condition at the time was far from healthy . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : 1 . Excessive debt and an excessive over-all amount of securities outstanding . As a consequence , a railroad might find that it could not pay full interest on its excessive debt , or at least that it was unable to pay dividends at an attractive rate on its stock , even though it was earning enough to support a reasonable capital structure . // 2 . Overexpansion . The rapid growth of the industry had inevitably included the building of some lines that were not economically justifiable . 3 . Competition between strong railroads and weak railroads , to the great detriment of the latter . Some of the 1920 amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act were intended primarily to improve , or at least to prevent deterioration of , the railroads ' condition . Only in this indirect way were they intended to protect the public . One provision , for example , empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission ( which will sometimes be referred to in this book as the ICC ) to prevent railroads from charging unreasonably low rates . Another permitted agreements between railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the ICC ; the original act had absolutely forbidden pooling . These provisions reflected the desire of the Congress to save the railroads from destructive competition with each other . So , in part , did provisions designed to encourage consolidations and mergers among the railroads . Another provision was intended chiefly to prevent additional overcapitalization or excessive debt . It forbade a railroad to issue securities without first obtaining the approval of the ICC . Still another provision sought to prevent over-extension of railroads by forbidding a railroad to extend its lines without ICC approval . All the provisions referred to , except some of those relating to railroad consolidations and mergers , are still in the Act . Growth of other modes of inland transportation . The most important transportation development of the period since World War I , however , has not been the ICC 's acquisition of additional powers over the railroads . It has been the rapid growth of other modes of transportation . The ultimate bases of this growth have // been technological innovations ? especially the development of the internal-combustion engine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered in a later chapter . Because of their low costs or charges ( oil pipelines , carriers by water ) , or because of their service advantages ( truckers ) leading to economies in distribution or to greater utility of the goods transported , the non-railroad modes have come to perform more than one-half the total number of ton-miles of inland intercity transportation of goods in the United States . This onehalf is about equally divided among motor carriers , oil pipelines , and carriers on inland waterways , including the Great Lakes . The airlines , chiefly because of their high charges , perform less than one-tenth of one per cent of the total . It should be noted that , although the railroads ' proportion of the nation 's freight traffic has greatly decreased since World War I , the actual amount of freight traffic handled by the railroads has increased . In 1926 ( the earliest year for which statistics by all modes of transportation are available ) , the railroads performed 77 per cent of the intercity ton-miles , and in 1957 only 46 or 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all modes of transportation more than doubled during the interval . So the railroads ' annual amount of freight traffic increased substantially . In passenger transportation , the decline in the railroads ' position has been much sharper than in freight transportation . For years the private automobile has performed nearly ninetenths of the intercity passenger-miles , and the railroad has been competing with the bus and the airplane for the remainder . In 1929 ( the earliest year for which complete statistics are available ) , the railroads performed 16 per cent of the total intercity passenger-miles and 76 per cent of the passengermiles of common carriers . The decline has been both relative and absolute ; for , although the total amount of travel more // than trebled by 1957 , the railroads ' share dropped to 3 or 4 per cent of the total and about 32 per cent of the travel by common carrier . The intercity bus lines , too , have been going downhill ? since 1944 in their proportional share of total traffic and since 1952 in their amount of traffic . Only private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and larger and larger proportions of the total number . In 1957 , for the first time in history , the airlines performed more intercity passenger-miles in the United States than either the railroads or the bus lines . The availability of alternative modes of transportation , with their diverse services and vast route mileage , has had several interesting , interrelated effects . One has been the development of new areas for the location of industries and of communities in general . Another has been an almost continual tendency of transportation to reduce the total real cost of production , for additional types of transportation service provide industry and commerce with additional means of achieving economies . Another ( of less national significance but important to transportation men ) has been the development of industrial traffic management ? that is , the buying of transportation ? as an exacting and highly skilled profession . Still another effect has been the increasing magnitude and complexity of government regulation of transportation . Amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act have provided for regulation by the ICC of the several non-railroad modes of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1935 , water carriers in 1940 . The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 created the Civil Aeronautics Board to regulate the airlines . Rate regulation now involves the new problem of fixing rates in such a way that each mode of transportation will attract the traffic for which it is best suited by its characteristics of cost and of service . // The competitive situation in transportation led also to a demand for basic changes in the Interstate Commerce Act . Some provisions in the act , enacted when the railroad industry enjoyed a near-monopoly , were thought to be harmful under the new conditions of intense competition among modes of transportation . Proposals were therefore made ? by railroad interests , by an advisory committee appointed by President Eisenhower , and by others ? for far-reaching amendments that would , among other things , give the several modes of land transportation greater freedom to adjust their rates to meet each other 's competition . Some of the proposed amendments were enacted in 1957 and 1958 ; the most important of them were embodied in the Transportation Act of 1958 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , has been a revolutionary change in the railroad industry . Gone is the complacent managerial attitude generally associated with this industry when it almost completely dominated the transportation picture . The railroads on the whole have become strikingly progressive in their acquisition of modern and diversified rolling-stock , their experimentation with such special devices as piggyback ( truck trailers on flat cars ) , their adoption of automation , their energetic sales policies , and so on . In some cases their progress would have been greater if the ICC had not restrained them , as in the case of the establishment of truck operations by railroads to supplement their rail services . As a rule , such operations are permitted by the ICC only under severely restrictive conditions . Competition , especially that of motor transportation , is the chief reason why the railroads , since 1916 , have abandoned much more mileage than they have constructed . In spite of the reduced mileage , however , improvements in equipment , road , and methods have caused the total carrying capacity of the railroads to increase . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overcome the chief obstacle to the development of a large American-flag foreign-trade merchant marine . This obstacle is the fact that it costs much more to operate an American-flag vessel than a foreign-flag vessel , mostly because of the higher wages paid on the former . Through subsidies , chiefly under a 1936 law discussed in a later chapter , the United States has attempted , with partial success , to overcome this handicap . At the same time , ocean transportation of freight between points in the continental United States has been severely handicapped by the high cost of stevedoring at American ports and by the great advances made by competitive inland transportation . As a consequence , about 73 per cent of the privately owned drycargo American-flag merchant marine was engaged in foreign commerce in 1958 . Most American foreign trade , however , moves in foreign-flag vessels . Some of these ships belong to Americans but , even so , are not subject to the high operating costs of American-flag vessels . Nations with liberal laws applicable to vessels registered under their flags have thus been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant fleet , which includes virtually no vessels owned by Liberian interests , was second in size only to the United Kingdom fleet . CHAPTER IV Ways SEA AND Am The most fundamental distinction between modes of transportation rests upon the kind of road or way on or through which the transportation takes place . The characteristics of the way profoundly affect the cost experience , the operational methods , the quality of service , and the territorial availability of each mode . The oceans of water and the ocean of air need not be bought , built , or maintained . In a sense , therefore , they are free . This may be said also of such inland seas as the Great Lakes . Paradoxically , however , the way utilized by a shipping line or by an airline is not wholly free . There are two reasons for this . One is that the way extends over the entire course from the spot where the vehicles start moving to the spot where their movement ends . The part of the sea way that extends into harbors or rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , Hudson River silt and shifting sandbars cause shoaling of the channels . Consequently the Army Corps of Engineers has to operate several large dredges to keep the channels sufficiently deep . The runways and taxiways of airports cost money to build and maintain . A person may well contend that the way includes more in a port than the channels 54 // of the harbor and more in an airport than the runways and taxiways , but these at least are beyond question a part of the way in each case , for vehicles transporting goods and passengers actually move along them . On some routes , ocean carriers also utilize canals or improved natural waterways connecting one sea with another . These include most conspicuously the Suez Canal , the Panama Canal , and the St. Lawrence Seaway . Such waterways are costly . The initial cost alone of the Panama Canal was $375,000,000 , the equivalent of more than one billion of today 's dollars . The St. Lawrence Seaway project , including dredging and the building of locks , dikes , and control dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a billion dollars . The second reason why the ways utilized by ocean carriers or by airlines are not free is that the facilities marking a w ? y and guiding traffic along it are not free . Lighthouses , radio signal stations , and other facilities by which beams , beacons , or messages are sent that provide guidance to sea or air navigators , all appear to be as much a part of the way as road signs are a part of a motor highway . In the case of airways , such facilities are fairly expensive to establish and to operate . New investment in them is continually being made , especially when important changes in the aircraft-guidance system are in progress . Congress appropriated $75,000,000 for establishment of air traffic control and navigation facilities in one recent 12-month period ( the fiscal year 1957 , ending June 30 , 1957 ) . In ocean and air transportation , as a rule , the way facilities that give rise to costs have many users . Therefore , very logically , they are supplied to rather than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities having only one user , or only one large user , are supplied by that user . This happened in // some aeronautically backward countries where a private airline had to set up its own airway facilities . In almost every case , way facilities having many users are established and operated by a government or by two or more governments acting in concert . An exceptional case was that of the Suez Canal , which was built and operated by a profitmaking joint-stock company ( of which the British government became a large minority stockholder ) under a concession to run from the opening of the canal in 1869 until 1968 . In 1956 , however , the Egyptian government took over the canal . As a consequence of the fact that way facilities are supplied by a government , the operators of airplanes or of vessels may not be required in every case to bear the full costs of the facilities . Even if the operators bear no part of them at all , however , the very existence of the costs means that the facilities are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as a whole . Someone has to pay for them . So far as ocean carriers and airlines pay for the supplying of way facilities to them , they do so by fees , tolls , and special taxes . These payments are based more or less on the extent of the carrier 's use of the facilities . Thus , an airline pays a fee for each landing at an airport , and the amount of the fee usually varies with the airplane 's size . At the present writing the landing fee at the New York International Airport ( Idlewild ) , for example , is 350 per thousand pounds of the airplane 's maximum allowable take-off gross weight , subject to a minimum charge of $2.50 per landing . Panama Canal tolls and Suez Canal tolls must be paid for each transit of the canal and are based on the vessel 's size in terms of net tonnage . A net ton in vessel measurement is not a weight unit . It is 100 cubic feet of enclosed space after de- // duction of the spaces not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , after deduction also of certain spaces that can be and are used for payload . Each of the two canals has its own rules for determining net tonnage , and in neither case are the rules the same as those used in the United States for the determination of the official net tonnage of a vessel , called its " net register tonnage . " " At the present writing the Panama Canal toll is 900 per net ton ( 720 if the vessel has no cargo or passengers ) . In the case of an ordinary C-2 cargo vessel , this amounts to about $5,500 . Less closely related to the amount of use of facilities by a carrier is the " tonnage tax " levied on a vessel for each voyage to the United States from a foreign country . This small tax of 60 per net ton ( 20 on voyages from some areas ) is paid only for each of the first 5 voyages in a year and is paid only once per voyage no matter how many ports in the United States the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency that supplies way facilities may consist largely of fixed charges and maintenance expenses that bear little relation to the use of the facilities by vessel or airplane operators in a given period . Nevertheless , as has been seen , a carrier 's special payments to the government vary roughly with the amount of its operations utilizing the facilities . In other words , the expenses borne by an airline or a shipping line as a result of its use of way facilities on a given route during a given period are much like its other flight or voyage expenses in their dependence on the number of flights or voyages and on the size of the vehicles operated . Although the ways utilized by shipping lines and airlines are wholly free neither to society nor to the carriers , they are less costly , by almost any standard of comparison that may be thought applicable ( investment per mile , annual cost per mile , // etc. ) , than land ways or inland waterways . This is a consequence of the facts , to which attention has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in their natural condition , whatever land or terminal facilities may have to be added , and that their copiousness and limited fields of use make it unnecessary to buy them . ( An exception to the last statement : in some cases an airport owner , which is usually a municipality , has bought air space by paying nearby land owners for the removal of structures on their land . ) Although alike in the fact that they need not be bought or built , sea and air differ sharply from each other in a perhaps even more important matter . In their effects on the amount of force needed for propulsion ? that is , on the resistance that has to be overcome ? they present an extreme contrast . Typically , about 5 pounds of resistance to movement per ton of vessel gross weight must be overcome to keep an ocean vessel cruising along . For a modern transport airplane , the corresponding figure would be in the vicinity of 100 pounds . In land transportation the resistance , and therefore the necessary propulsive force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally somewhere between these two extremes . By comparison to transport units ( trains , trucks , etc. ) moving on land , those on water have the advantage of buoyancy and the disadvantage of having to move through a fluid denser than air . The total effect of these and related factors is that at a certain speed , roughly 19 miles per hour , about as much force is needed to keep an ocean vessel moving as to keep a train of equal weight moving on level , straight track . But track does not generally remain level and straight for a very long distance . As will be seen in the following section , grades and curves add to the resistance that must be overcome . Partly as a consequence , greater force , on the average , is required to keep a train moving than to keep a vessel of equal weight moving . // In the case of transportation by airplane , the situation is the reverse of that in ocean transportation , for the sea of air is lighter than the transport unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airplane on which the lift is exerted move with great speed . Great force is therefore required . Almost inevitably it will be much greater per ton of transport unit than the tractive force needed in any other mode of transportation . It is chiefly because of these various characteristics of the ways that the line-haul cost of ocean transportation is generally lower , and the line-haul cost of air transportation is almost always higher , than that of either rail or motor transportation . RAILWAYS AND HIGHWAYS Unlike the ways used by ocean carriers and airlines , land ways have to be constructed virtually in their entirety . The construction is usually based on preliminary studies leading to a selection of the best route , to a determination of the weights , speeds , and quantities of traffic to be anticipated , and finally to the drawing up of the precise specifications . A strip of land is acquired and cleared . The low parts of the strip are filled in or bridged . The high parts are cut down or through . The center of the strip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a sort of basic embankment . It must be high enough to permit draining , for water can do great injury to railways and highways . On this underlying subgrade , as it is called , may be placed a foundation of selected material . In a railway this is a sub-ballast of cinders , coarse sand , gravel , or other somewhat porous substance . The sub-ballast may be 8 or even 12 inches thick . In a highway it is a sub-base , 14 inches thick in some highways , also of material that drains . Resting on the sub-ballast of a railway is the ballast itself , harder and even more porous than the sub-ballast . It consists of such material as crushed stone , // broken slag , or prepared gravel . The Norfolk and Western Railway boasts that its ballast is " a 15-inch cushion of the finest crushed limestone available . " Ballast contributes to the smoothness of the ride , permits free drainage , and serves to bear and to diffuse the weight of trains . In a modem highway , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-base . It may be 8 inches or so of penetration macadam . On top of all is placed the pavement of the highway ? perhaps asphaltic concrete ? or the crossties and rails . Additional facilities are required for various purposes , especially preservation of the way ( ditches and other drainage facilities , fences ) and guidance and control of traffic ( signs , signals , switches , electric communication systems ) . Initial cost and maintenance . How much does all this cost ? Obviously , the value or price per mile of the strip of land depends on its location and width . The cost of construction depends on the number of lanes or tracks and on all the specifications . It depends also on how rugged the terrain is . Therefore cost comparisons and over-all average costs are of very limited significance . This is especially true if the costs were incurred in different periods of time . Most railroad lines were built long ago under conditions varying from line to line and very different from conditions today . As indications of the general magnitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern land way , however , it may be noted that some toll roads in recent years cost more than $1,000,000 per mile ; that the gross investment in railroad " road " ? which in railroad accounting means fixed plant ( ways and structures ) as distinguished from moving plant ( equipment ) ? averages about $102,000 per mile and would be much higher if the way had to be built today from scratch ; and that a branch extension of a small railroad was built in 1957 for only $40,000 per mile , while // more than that was spent merely on improvements of some main-line mileage . Large capital outlays are still being made on both way systems , but much more on the highway system , because of its serious inadequacy , than on the shrinking railroad mileage . The highway system has failed to keep pace with defense needs , with actual and anticipated traffic requirements , and with the demands of safety . The railroads ' problem of adequacy centers on equipment more than on way , but the railroads nevertheless continue to improve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by heavier rails , by yard improvements , by centralized traffic control systems , and by other means . Although both railways and highways require large expenditures for maintenance , railway maintenance is , on a per-mile basis , by far the more costly of the two . Here are the approximate capital outlays made during a recent year ( 1958 ) in the United States for additions and betterments to highways and to railroad ways and structures and the maintenance expenses for each , all stated in millions of dollars : Capital outlay Maintenance I 1 i ghways $6,207 $2,223 Railroad ways and structures 258 1,223 In the light of the foregoing discussion , it is not surprising that , as the figures indicate , the railroads ' annual expense for road maintenance currently exceeds their annual capital outlay on road , and that the opposite obtains in the case of highways . It should be pointed out , however , that in some cases the distinction between a capital investment and a maintenance expense is a bit arbitrary , and that this distinction in highway records does not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of what may be thought an arbitrary way of dealing with the matter , consider the accounting in62 FUNDAMENTALS OF TRANSPORTATION structions given to the railroads by the ICC regarding the replacement of lighter rails by heavier ones . The cost of the excess weight of the heavier rails is considered an investment or capital expenditure , but the cost of the labor and train service used by the railroad in distributing , unloading , and applying the new rail and for removing the old rail is accounted for as maintenance of roadway . More or less corresponding expenditures for a new type of surfacing of highways are sometimes called capital outlays . Weight-bearing capacity . An important characteristic of a way is the amount of weight it can bear , both at each point and over a given length , without the incurring of excessive maintenance expense . Other factors being equal , the greater this weight the greater the capacity of the way and the lower the cost of operation on it . The weight that can be borne varies from rail line to rail line and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track is permitted to support a much greater weight than a highway . This is one of the reasons for the lower average linehaul cost of rail transportation . Ostensibly to prevent unreasonably high maintenance expenses and to keep bridges from becoming overloaded , the states impose weight limitations of various sorts on conveyances using the highways . For present purposes it will be sufficient to indicate the maximum axle weight . The strictest and most common axle-load limit ? imposed by 31 states as of July 1 , 1956 ? is 18,000 pounds . The most liberal limit is 22,400 pounds . Tandem-axle loads are required to be somewhat smaller than twice the maximum single-axle load . Thus , most of the states that impose the 18,000-pound limit permit only 32,000 pounds as a tandem-axle weight . Those figures may be contrasted with the axle loads of 100 , - 000 pounds ( at speeds up to 100 miles per hour ) considered // suitable for rails adopted by the Pennsylvania Railroad for its main line early in the 1930 's . Other factors being equal , the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds per yard . Thus , the Pennsylvania rails referred to are 152-pound rails ? that is , they weigh 152 pounds per yard . They replaced 130-pound rails , considered suitable for axle loads of only 80,000 pounds ( moving at speeds of 80 miles per hour ) . The relationship between weight of rail and maximum axle weight involves the maximum speed because the greater the speed the smaller the maximum axle load appropriate to rails of a given weight . Grades . The capacity of a way and the cost of operation on it are affected also by its grades . A grade ( or gradient ) may be defined as a degree of rise or descent . It is the rate at which a way deviates from the horizontal level . In arithmetical terms , it is the ratio , generally stated as a per cent , of a rise or descent to the distance in which the rise or descent takes place . If a way rises 2 feet for 100 feet in its length , for example , it has a grade of 2 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to the next . To keep a transport unit moving up a grade , the propulsive force must overcome the effect of gravity tending to pull the unit down the grade . This pull amounts to the weight of the transport unit multiplied by the per cent of grade . Thus , each ton of the transport unit requires 20 pounds of tractive force for a grade of 1 per cent , 40 pounds of force for a grade of 2 per cent , and so on . This is in addition to almost all the force required to keep the transport unit in motion at the same speed on level ground . In the case of a freight train , which is likely to offer a resistance of about 5 pounds per ton of train when cruising at 20 or 25 miles per hour on straight , level track , a grade of 2 per cent would therefore require about 9 times as much force as would be required on level track . Small wonder that the // grades of main lines rarely exceed 2 per cent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 1 per cent or less . Although the increased resistance per ton of transport unit that must be overcome on an upgrade of a given per cent is essentially the same on a highway as on a railway , the difficulty caused by the grade is less serious in the case of highway transportation . For one thing , the percentage of increase in the resistance of a highway transport unit is smaller than in the case of a railroad train , because the resistance in the former case is relatively high even without a grade . The tractive resistance of a cruising truck or tractor-trailer combination on a perfectly level highway of good concrete construction is likely to be about 20 pounds per ton . It is several times that of a railroad train on level track , for the friction of steel wheel rolling on steel rail is much less for a given weight than the friction of rubber tire on even the best highway . This is a basic physical advantage underlying the relative economy of line-haul transportation by railroad . But it entails a greater relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 per cent grade requires about 5 times as much force as cruising at a grade of zero in the case of a train and only about twice as much in the case of a truck . Another advantage of motor over rail transportation in the negotiation of grades is the greater extent to which speed can be sacrificed to force in motor transportation . At this point a brief reference to the basic arithmetical relationship between power , force ( or resistance overcome ) , and velocity ( speed ) may be helpful . The effective power of a transport unit ? whether a truck , an airplane , a railroad train , or any other ? produces both force and velocity . The product by multiplication of these two factors , force and velocity , equals the power that produces them . In conventional units , 375 horsepower = tractive force in pounds x speed in miles per hour . // At any given horsepower , therefore , an increase in the resis-tance to be overcome ? that is , an increase in the tractive effort required ? entails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be maintained in spite of an increase in resistance , the power must be increased in proportion . For example , the draw-bar horse-power ( the horsepower pulling the whole train minus the horse-power propelling the locomotive itself ) required to pull each ton of a train of 50-ton freight cars moving at 25 miles per hour is as follows : on level track 0.34 horsepower on a 1 per cent grade 1.68 horsepower on a 2 per cent grade 3.01 horsepower The rates of increase in power are thus seen to equal the rates of increase in force necessary to negotiate the grades ( without reductions in speed ) , roughly indicated a little earlier in this section . If the available power of a locomotive is insufficient for so great an increase , the extra force required by a grade can be ob-tained only by sacrifice of speed . But there are limits beyond which it is undesirable or even impossible for this to be done . In addition to serious problems of traffic congestion that arise on many railroads if trains move more slowly than about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a very great increase of tractive effort at the expense of speed . One is the fact that if a diesel locomotive is operated very long at full throttle below a certain speed , it becomes damaged by over-heat-ing . The other is that an increase in tractive effort above a cer-tain limit causes the driving wheels to slip on the smooth track . As a rule of thumb , the tractive effort of a diesel locomotive can not exceed one-fourth of the weight on its driving wheels , no matter how great the power or how slow the speed . // But here the greater friction of rubber tire rolling on high-way pays off . In conjunction with the availability of extreme gear reduction , it enables a motor transport unit to use its power for the exertion of greatly increased force at greatly re-duced speed . To choose an example almost at random , a type of General Motors tractor pulling a full load can climb a grade of 15.8 per cent at 3.1 miles per hour . Although steep grades can be negotiated by motor transport units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the adverse effect of grades on speed ( especially of tractor-trailer combinations ) leads road designers to try to keep the gradients reasonably low . What is reasonably low for highways , however , might be extremely steep for railroads . An indication of the steepest grades considered acceptable on a supermodern highway is given in the following recommendation by a group of experts : " For design speeds of 70 , 60 , and 50 miles per hour , gradients generally shall be not steeper than 3 , 4 , and 5 per cent , respect-ively . Gradients 2 per cent steeper may be provided in rugged terrain . " ' In the case of a railroad , the stricter limits on the sacrifice of speed in favor of tractive effort make it necessary in many cases to surrender to a grade by having the locomotive move a lighter train than the maximum-weight train it could move on level track . The effect of the grade on resistance per ton is still the same , but it is exercised on fewer tons and thus the total resistance is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the investment and expense that they entail , may of course provide additional tractive effort . On any run in which a train is pulled by the same locomotive , // there is a certain grade that imposes the strictest limitation on the weight of the train . It is called the " ruling grade . " The tougher this grade , the smaller the train ; and the smaller the train , as a rule , the greater the cost per ton-mile , for reasons that will be taken up in the next chapter . Curves . Curves have much the same effect as grades : they increase the resistance to motion . Curvature may be expressed in terms of the radius of the circle of which the curve is geometrically a part . The longer the radius , the larger the circle and the milder the curve . Or another method of expressing the degree of curvature may be used . By this method , one imagines lines drawn from the center of the circle to two points on the circumference 100 feet apart . The angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle is the degree of curve . In other words , the degree of curve is the angle subtended at the center by a chord 100 feet long . The larger the angle , the smaller the circle and the sharper the curve . Because curve resistance and grade resistance are substantially the same in their effects and may occur on the same stretch of way , it is sometimes helpful to add them together or even to convert the degree of curve to a degree of grade . A 1-degree curve adds approximately as much to resistance as a 0.04 per cent grade . Thus , a track with an actual grade of 2 per cent and a 1-degree curve may be said to have an " equated grade " of 2.04 per cent . It is the equated grade , rather than the actual grade , that really tends to limit the size of trains , for it indicates the total added resistance . As every motorist knows , curves are troublesome also because vehicles going around them develop centrifugal force and must therefore avoid high speeds as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the centrifugal force on comfort as well as on safety must be considered . There are more // reasons than one , therefore , why railroad and highway designers seek to minimize the number and the sharpness of curves . Some rail lines and highways have no curvatures above 2 degrees . Even in the Berkshire hills , the new Massachussetts turnpike has a minimum curvature radius of 3,000 feet , the equivalent of approximately a 2-degree curve . In very mountainous terrain , however , sharp curves are necessary for the avoidance of even more harmful grades . In extreme cases rail curvature is as great as 10 degrees . Relatively sharp curves may be necessary also in urban areas , for the circumvention of structures and facilities of the community . The effect of a land way on resistance to movement is not solely a matter of grades and curves . The surface of the way is immensely important , both in itself and in the type of wheel appropriate to it . As previously indicated , it is here that the railways enjoy a tremendous advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a straight , level way , about 5 pounds of tractive effort per ton will keep a train moving but that about 20 pounds per ton are needed to keep a highway freight transport unit moving . On a road not of the very best surfacing , the 20 may well become 25 , 30 , or even more . Private and public ways . An apparent advantage of highways over railways lies in the greater flexibility of movement possible on them . A train can not move freely to the left or right to pass another train or to permit it to pass . Most rail mileage is single-track , making it impossible for trains to pass each other freely even in opposite directions . One train , of course , is switched onto a side track ( " passing track " ) so that another can pass it , whether going in the same or the opposite direction . But , for this not to involve great delay , the whole process of train dispatching and traffic control requires coordination and precision . Therefore the public is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such use was permitted at the very start of // railroading . By paying a toll , a man could operate his wagon or coach on the track , provided the wheels and gauge were suitable . But a user had to reduce his speed to that of the user whom he overtook , and there was serious difficulty when two users came toward each other in opposite directions . One of them , sometimes selected by combat , had to back up to the next side track . Such a method of operation obviously could not work well . It soon became clear that the railroad company itself had to control and operate the transport units using the railway . Motor highways , having no fixed tracks , permit more flexible movement . Subject to the limitations imposed by traffic congestion and regulations , transport units can pass each other freely . Accordingly , there is no need for unified operation or for confinement to one user . This is why the way is open to the public . But which type of way really has the net advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination and unified control of traffic . It avoids the delay resulting from trains waiting for other trains to pass them . On the other hand , the absence of coordination and the exercise of freedom of movement cause highway users to slow down and to accelerate more frequently and more rapidly than in the case of a railway . This adds to the complexity and initial cost of the equipment used on highways as well as to the cost of operating and maintaining the equipment . One of the most interesting and important consequences of the fact that railroads are private ways while motor highways are open to the public is the contrast between the methods by which the users in each case bear the annual cost of the way . This cost includes interest on the investment in the way , amortization of the investment or depreciation of the depreciable elements ( land itself is not considered depreciable but structures // are ) , maintenance of the way , the expense of traffic control , and property taxes . In the case of a public highway , the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property may properly be included in the annual cost of the way . A substantial part of the total annual cost of a railway or highway is likely to be constant ? that is , it is likely not to increase or decrease with an increase or reduction in the amount of traffic , unless the change in traffic quantity is so great that it requires a change in the way itself . Property taxes , interest on the investment in the way , and amortization or depreciation where applicable , are constant . The cost of maintenance of way includes a substantial constant element , for natural factors such as rain and temperature changes , not only the movement of trains or of motor equipment , do harm to a land way and entail the need for its inspection and repair . By a rough rule of thumb , some railway men assume that about two-thirds of the maintenance-of-way cost is independent of the volume of traffic . A railroad , the user of its own way , bears the costs of the way as what they are . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor carrier , on the contrary , is only one of many users . To the extent that it pays the way costs , it does so in much the same way that a person generally pays for the nonexclusive use of facilities supplied by someone else . In other words , it pays in rough proportion to the amount of its use of the facilities . Motor carriers pay taxes on the fuel they purchase and other taxes on or measured by the amount and size of their equipment . Both items , although fuel more accurately than equipment , reflect the amount of the carrier 's highway operations . In some states , carriers pay an additional tax for each mile of highway movement within the state , with the rate per mile dependent on the size of the equipment . Toll // charges , where levied , also reflect highway use . Thus , the way costs as borne by a motor carrier are far more variable than those of a railroad ? that is , they vary much more with the amount of the carrier 's transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen ) from a physical difference between railways and highways , contributes to far-reaching contrasts between the two modes of transportation in their rate policies and rate regulatory formulas , as will be shown in a later chapter . RIVERS AND CANALS Everyone knows that canals are costly , but many persons think that navigable rivers are a gift of nature . In the American transportation system this is far from true . The federal government has spent , and is still spending , vast sums to improve the navigability of rivers , especially by providing them with adequate channels , which on the most important waterways are at least 9 feet deep . The money is spent on dredging , revetment of banks , elimination of long bends by cutoffs , and other works . Some rivers have been practically turned into canals by the construction , maintenance , and operation of a system of dams and locks . The entire Ohio River and the Upper Mississippi River ( the part of the Mississippi above the mouth of the Missouri River , which is near St. Louis ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of inland waterways includes an even larger proportion of constant cost than that of railways or highways . Like all the ways previously discussed except railways , inland waterways have many users . When they paid for their use of canals , they did so through tolls . Thus , as in the case of the users of other public ways , the way costs , although partly or largely constant , were experienced by canal users as variable costs . Tolls have been discontinued , so that at present these carriers do not pay way costs at all . Tolls are // charged for use of the St. Lawrence Seaway , but this is more a part of an ocean way than an inland waterway . Locks and currents are somewhat equivalent to the grades of a land way , both in their cause and in their effects . By means of locks , vessels are lifted or lowered from one level of the waterway to the next level . They are necessary but , like grades , they add to the cost and time required for transportation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are 46 locks on the Ohio River , 25 on the Upper Mississippi , 7 on the Illinois Waterway ( connecting Chicago with the Mississippi ) , and 34 on the part of the New York State Canal System ( outgrowth of the old Erie Canal ) between Lake Erie and Troy on the Hudson River . The water condition between successive dams in a canalized river is generally " poop ' ? that is , there is virtually no current stage . Elsewhere , however , river currents may be strong . They are like grades in their effect on the resistance to movement . Like a tractor hauling a full load , a towboat with a sizable tow has a very limited reserve of power and therefore has to slow up considerably if the resistance increases very much . Typically , tows of between 12 to 15 barges move down the Lower Mississippi from St. Louis to New Orleans at average speeds of 9 to 12 miles per hour . Coming back against the current , the tows are generally of about 8 to 10 barges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . During certain periods of the year , when the water is high , the currents are faster than at other times . Upstream transportation on some sections of the Lower Mississippi then meets so much resistance that normal-size tows can not move through those sections at all and the operator has to " double trip . " Thus , the strongest current met on a trip has an effect something like that of the ruling grade on a railway . If a river is affected by tides , the water flow alternates between upstream and downstream . This is the case on the Hudson River , where tides travel 145 miles upstream to Troy . A tow going up // this river may enjoy a favorable tide for a certain distance and may then be slowed up , or even brought to a complete halt , by the ebb tide , reinforced in season by freshet conditions creating a strong downstream flow . The favorable effect of a constant downstream current on a downstream tow does not fully counterbalance its adverse effect on an identical upstream tow . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel consumption at constant power are greater than they would be if there were no current at all . This is a result of the fact that the upstream trip takes longer than the downstream trip . The adverse current is therefore ex-perienced for a longer period than the favorable current , and its total effect is consequently greater . The readiness of most persons to equate the two effects has been regarded as evidence of a tendency to think in terms of space rather than in terms of time . An important shortcoming of inland waterways in the northern states is that freezing renders them non-navigable for periods of as long as 43 months each year . This applies to the Great Lakes as well as to the New York State Canal System , parts of the Upper Mississippi , and other waterways . SPEED It has been seen that the nature of a way strongly influences the amount of force necessary to propel a transport unit at a given speed , and that it therefore affects the amount of power needed . For , as already indicated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As speed increases , force remaining unchanged , power must increase only in proportion to speed . But greater speed causes greater resistance and there-fore increases the force necessary to pull a given weight . In air and water transportation , speed has an especially great effect on resistance and necessary force . Consequently , an increase in // speed requires a more-than-proportional increase in power by all modes of transportation , but the rate of power increase is greater in air and water than in land transportation . For example , the necessary power is approximately doubled if the speed of a Mariner vessel is increased from 20 to 24 miles per hour or if the speed of a railroad train is increased from 20 to 32 miles per hour . In air transportation the necessity of a large and expensive crew in ratio to the capacity of an airplane brings about economies when speed is increased . which at least partly offset the tremendously increased mechanical cost of the greater speed ; also , the special sales appeal of air transportation is speed , which may therefore justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even nearly the same degree in ocean freight transportation . In this field the cost of speeds above about 23 miles per hour ( 20 knots ) is generally prohibitive . In motor and rail transportation the principal limitations on speed are imposed by considerations of safety and of capacity . For an increase in speed generally causes a more-than-proportional increase in stop distance ? that is , in the distance within which the driver can bring the unit to a complete stop . This increase in stop distance not only affects safety but , at high speeds , may require so great a distance between successive units that it reduces the capacity of the way . The stop distance may be divided into two parts . The first part varies directly with the speed . It is the distance covered during the preliminary period before the effective braking actually starts . This preliminary period includes the approximately 1.5 seconds that elapse while the driver becomes aware of the need to stop and reacts to it . It includes also the distance covered during the lag between the drivers ' application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the case of a highway transport unit equipped with air brakes , this may be about 0.4 // seconds . Thus , for such a unit , about 1.9 seconds elapse before the effective braking begins . If a truck is moving at 30 miles per hour , which is 44 feet per second , the distance covered dur-ing this preliminary period is 83.6 feet ( 44 x 1.9 ) . At 60 miles per hour ? that is , 88 feet per second ? it is exactly twice as far . The second part of the stop distance is the distance required after the effective braking begins . This distance varies with the square of the speed . If the speed is increased by 50 per cent , the effective braking distance is increased by 125 per cent ; if the speed is doubled , the effective braking distance is quadrupled ; and so on . All of this may be illustrated by the following table , ? which shows the approximate stop distance ( feet ) at various speeds ( miles per hour ) for a light truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the distance that the unit moves during the period of perception , reaction , and brake lag . It will be noted that because the effective braking distance varies with the square of the speed , the total stop distance varies more than in direct arithmetical proportion to the speed . Above speeds of about 60 miles per hour on highways and about 50 miles per hour on railways , the stop distance increases at so 77 WAYS // steep a rate that , except in cases of rail passenger transportation and of straight highways having no capacity problem , speed limits rarely exceed these velocities by very much . Speed comparisons between modes of transportation are sub-ject to all sorts of qualifications . For what interest they may have , however , some cruising speeds and speed limits in miles per hour are shown below . They represent speed of movement and are not to be confused with overall transit speed . The latter is an average for the run ; it reflects the periods of acceleration and of deceleration , periods when the unit is at rest at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AVAILABILITY OF WAY SYSTEMS In its extent , the waterway system of the United States is subject to obvious natural limitations . Within the field of land transportation , the reasons for the much greater mileage of highways than of railways include the low cost of providing and maintaining highways designed for very light traffic . They also include the fact , emphasized earlier in this chapter , that railroad companies ( unlike highway users ) must invest in the construction of , and pay all the annual costs of , their own ways . Airways are hard to fit into the picture because , although the lanes through the airspace designated as airways ? that is , the federal airways system ? are measurable , not all flying is confined to airways in that sense . The miles of identifiable way , exclusive of the oceans and the Great Lakes , between points in the United States , are approximatelv as follows ! // As indications of the relative territorial availability of the several modes , these figures should be considered in the light of the interrelationship among ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the others , highways make them more broadly available . If instead of using linearway measurement , one determined the areas in square miles of territorial units ( however conceived ) in which goods originate or terminate that undergo their major intercity movement by a given mode of transportation , the disparity , for example , between rail and highway availability would appear much smaller . The highways have , indeed , proved both a blessing and a curse to the railways . Although they have diverted a great deal of traffic , they have also helped the railroads , both by feeding traffic to them from points not directly served by rail and by providing them with large quantities of freight required for highway construction or in the automotive-equipment industries . Also , the mere mileage figures do not show what proportion of the points between the termini of routes receive service . One thousand route miles might provide service to 2 points or to 200 points . Because of the severe effect of take-offs and landings on operating costs per airplane-mile and on over-all speed , so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of points in proportion to the miles of federal airways or of airline routes . One might maintain , indeed , that the number of points or localities served is a better indication of the availability of a type of way or type of service than the way mileage . A difficulty arises , however , because of the ambiguity of " point " or " locality . " Such a term may mean a city or town in the usual sense ? that is , a corporate municipality or , where there is no such , an unincorporated community commonly thought of as a town or village . Or it may mean a station ? that is , a place where a carrier re- // ceives or delivers passengers or freight for the public ; this is different from the other meaning , for one station may serve several cities or towns , or there may be several stations in one city . Or a " point " or " locality " may be a municipal area ? that is , an area that acts like a local economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of more municipalities than one . Or points may be places listed in tariffs or routing guides ; in this case some of them may be little more than popular or con-venient designations for parts of municipalities , including parts that have no separate stations of their own . The ambiguity of " point " or " locality " overlaps the ambiguity of " served . " Is a point served by rail merely because it is within a railroad 's pickup-and-delivery area ? If water carriers deliver coal to the private wharf of an electric power company but provide no other service to the community , is the community a point served by water transportation ? If in a community there is an airport to and from which charter or air-taxi service ( but no regular airline service ) can be obtained , or an airport used commercially only by an industrial concern flying its own air-planes , or used only by individual private flyers , is the com-munity served by air transportation ? Although a definition of " point served " can largely resolve such ambiguities , figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading picture of the extent to which a mode of transportation is significantly available . The num-erical differences that result from certain different meanings of " points served " in air transportation within the United States are indicated by the following approximate figures : // By almost any definition of " point served , " however , the types of way previously discussed , or the modes of transportation utilizing them , rank in the same order . The following order obtains with respect to availability in terms of identifiable mileage , number of points served , and aggregate population of points served : highways , railways , airways , inland waterways . The first three are much closer to each other in aggregate population served than in points served or in mileage . The relatively few municipal areas served by scheduled airlines contain more than half the population of the United States . There is another dimension of availability : the readiness , in time and low cost , with which a way system can be extended to a locality not previously served by it . Here , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for fiirst place . Almost any locality can get some sort of satisfactory connection with the existing highway system of the nation in which it is located , provided that the existing system is reasonably near and there are no serious obstacles in the terrain to be crossed . If one of these conditions does not obtain , air transportation may generally be introduced more quickly and at lower initial cost . For this reason it has preceded extension of the highway system into various remote or not easily accessible parts of the world , such as mining regions of northwestern Canada and potentially rich agricultural areas in the interior of Brazil . Except in an extremely low , flat country , inland waterways are the least readily extensible of all way systems . They are therefore not readily adaptable to the transportation needs of the United States . If the price of water transportation is low enough , however , the traffic flow will to some extent adapt itself to the waterways . This is happening on the Mississippi River , which runs north-south in a country whose national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Lakes route ( Lakes Superior , Huron , and Erie ) , on the contrary , runs along the predominant axis . Happily located with respect to areas that produce iron ore , grain , and coal , this route has denser freight traffic than any other way of comparable length in the United States . CHAPTER V Transport Units WHAT IS A TRANSPORT UNIT ? A transport unit is any mobile unit of equipment , or combination of two or more connected but separable mobile units of equipment , that performs a " run " or haul . Thus a railroad train is a transport unit . So is a ship . So is a transport plane . So is a truck . So is a tractor-trailer combination . So is a combination of one or more towboats and one or more barges pulled or pushed by the towboat or towboats , all moving together as a connected unit . Some mobile units of equipment are power units , some are vehicles , and some are both . A power unit is a self-propelled unit of equipment whose power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle is a mobile unit of equipment in or on which goods or persons ( or both ) are transported . According to the nomenclature adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers and the definition in the Interstate Commerce Act , * " motor vehicle " denotes a tractor as well as a trailer or a truck , but in the present volume the term " vehicle " will not be used in this broad sense . A tractor will be considered merely a power unit , not a vehicle , for freight is not moved in it . By the same token a towboat or a diesel locomotive is a power unit but not a vehicle . *Section 203 ( a ) ( 13 ) . 82 // A vehicle may or may not be self-propelled . If it is self-propelled it is also a power unit and may be operated as an entire transport unit in itself . A ship or a transport airplane comes within this category . Trailers , most railroad cars , and most barges , on the contrary , are just vehicles , not power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , however , are self-propelled . COMBINATION UNITS If a transport unit consists of two or more units of equipment , it may be called a combination unit . Combination units are used in almost all rail transportation and in most intercity transportation of freight by motor vehicle or by barge . Thought has been given to their use also in air-cargo transportation . A combination unit in this field would consist of an airplane and one or more gliders towed by the airplane . Each glider would be loaded with goods for a certain intermediate point and would be detached from the unit over or near the airport serving that point . Thus the unit would not have to stop at intermediate points . The airplane itself could carry goods to the ultimate airport . The airlines found , however , that the operation of combination units would be uneconomical and , at least for the present , do not appear to be giving it serious consideration . Incidentally , a self-propelled vehicle is sometimes found in a combination unit . The principal such case is that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western states whose liberal length-of-combination restrictions make such operations feasible . Also , there are cases of two or more self propelled rail passenger cars being operated as a unit . The following discussion , however , will be based chiefly on the usual type of combination unit ? that is , a transport unit in which one or more power units that are not vehicles propel one or more vehicles that are not power units . A consequence of the operation of combination units is that // a carrier can retire old power units and buy new ones without having to change its fleet of vehicles , and it can acquire or retire vehicles without changing its fleet of power units . Changes in the nature of the demand for service , changes in operating conditions , or the availability of a new type of equipment may indicate the profitability of an adjustment in one of the two fleets when changes in the other would be costly and pointless . This flexibility goes far beyond that of a carrier 's alternatives in replacing part or all of the propulsion mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far more restricted in what it can accomplish by selecting new engines for its old airplanes than a motor carrier is in selecting new tractors to draw its old trailers or than a railroad is in choosing new locomotives to pull its old cars . In 1946 , 88 per cent of the locomotives in service in the United States were steam locomotives and they performed 88 per cent of the intercity rail service . In 1956 , 86 per cent of the locomotive units were diesels . In that year they performed 88 per cent of the road ( intercity ) service . This quick change to a more economical type of power unit would have been economically impractical and physically impossible ? for lack of the quantity of the types of materials needed for a completely new fleet of cars ? without the separability of vehicles and power units . Another consequence of the operation of combination units is that the carrier is enabled to keep its power units in motion more continuously than it could if it operated only self-propelled vehicles . In the latter case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two are one unit of equipment . While the vehicle is being loaded , unloaded , or serviced , the power unit is necessarily immobile . But a separable power unit can be elsewhere , moving another vehicle . This increases its " utilization " ? that is , its hours of use during a given period . Greater utilization of each power unit , in turn , reduces the number of // power units needed by a carrier . Thus , even a motor carrier that never uses more than one trailer in a transport unit may own fewer tractors than trailers . Two such carriers , for example ? Associated Transport and McLean Trucking Company ? own approximately 1.4 trailers and 1.6 trailers , respectively , for every tractor . MULTI-VEHICLE UNITS The two consequences , both of them advantageous , that have been discussed flow from the mere separability of power unit and vehicle . They apply even in the case , to which attention was drawn , of a carrier that operates combination units each consisting of one power unit and one vehicle . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of vehicles , as in railroad trains and barge tows , certain additional advantages can be gained . Such multi-vehicle combination units permit attainment of the economies resulting from the use of large transport units and , at the same time , the economies resulting from the use of small vehicles . The nature of these economies will be indicated later . It may be pointed out here , however , that in land transportation very large transport units can not exist at all unless they are multi-vehicle combination units . Imagine a self-propelled land vehicle with a capacity of 2,000 tons , which would make it approximately equivalent to a 50-car railroad train . It would , of course , be virtually inoperable , yet railroads operate trains two and three times as large . To some extent , the same principle obtains in transportation on inland waterways having locks or sharp bends . Many tows are too large for a lock and therefore have to go through in two or more lockages . A single barge as large as such a tow would be inoperable on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large transport units and the economies resulting from them are dependent , in both land transportation // and , to some extent , in inland-waterway transportation , upon the operation of multi-vehicle combination units . Another feature of the use of multi-vehicle units is the adjustment of the capacity of a transport unit to the amount of available traffic . Within operational limits , the transport unit can be made as large as the traffic will justify . At the same time , the size of the transport unit can be kept down so that the amount of unused capacity will be minimized . Let us suppose that only 1,500 tons of freight are available and that our carrier operates self-propelled vehicles , perhaps ocean vessels , of 6,000-tons capacity each . If one of these vehicles moves with only that small load , the uneconomic nature of the operation is apparent . The cost of the operation will depend partly on the capacity , largely unused , of the vessel . In short , our large , self-propelled vehicle lacks adaptability . If rail transportation is a possible alternative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train of perhaps 30 cars to do the job , with a total capacity and power appropriate to the payload . It is not the small capacity of the vehicles in itself but rather the use of a multi-vehicle combination unit that makes possible this adaptability of the size of the transport unit . If the transport units were tractortrailer combinations with the relatively minute capacity of 15 tons each , 100 transport units would be required . Consequently , all the economy resulting from the operation of one or a few large transport units instead of many small ones would be lost . Each unit , although loaded to capacity , would be unadapted to the available quantity of traffic . Not all the consequences of multi-vehicle units are advantageous . Such units must be assembled at origin and broken up at destination . These processes require fixed facilities , equipment , and labor , all of which add to the cost of the service . They also require time , which detracts from the quality of the service . In some railroad operations a car is part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train is broken up and the car becomes part of another train , causing additional cost and expenditure of time . If a combination unit includes vehicles picked up or destined to intermediate points , as occurs in both rail and barge transportation , there is additional expense and delay at those points . These adverse effects of multi-vehicle units are more serious for a railroad than for a barge line , for railroads operate more vehicles per transport unit and must perform their terminal operations chiefly in their own costly yards . A railroad freight train has to perform a fairly long run before the aggregate advantage resulting from its type of way and from the use of a large multivehicle transport unit makes up for the adverse effects of the terminal operations . ECONOMIES EFFECTED BY LARGE TRANSPORT UNITS Smaller crew per unit capacity . Certain economies can be achieved by the operation of relatively large transport units . One of the most important of them derives from the fact that the size of the transport-unit crew is only slightly variable with the size of the unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of transport-unit capacity tends to decrease as the size of the unit increases . The size of the crew depends largely on the need to have certain functions performed for the unit as a unit rather than as an aggregate of a certain size . On an ocean cargo vessel , for example , only 1 mate is needed to stand a given watch as deck officer . Each man who stands watch does so for 8 hours a day . Therefore : 3 mates must be on board for the purpose of standing watch , whether the vessel is large or small . If it is a fairly large American-flag ship , its first mate does not ordinarily stand watch but serves instead as a day-working chief mate . Therefore a fourth or " junior third " mate is needed as a watchstander . So , // although the size of the vessel may be influential in determining whether the number of mates shall be 3 or 4 , it is not likely to produce any greater range in this category . For similar reasons , a tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the vessel is found also in most of the other categories of the crew . Therefore the ratio of vessel crew to vessel size tends to be relatively small for relatively large vessels . The point may be illustrated by reference to the ore-carrying vessels operated by Alcoa 's Pan-Ore Steamship Division . The largest of them is a steamship with a deadweight tonnage ( total carrying capacity in long tons ) of 34,200 . It is operated by a crew of 45 men , including the master . Pan-Ore 's two other steamships have deadweight tonnages of 7,950 and 8,035 , respectively , and a crew of 37 each . To make the crew figures strictly comparable , one man should be deducted from the crew of the larger vessel because he is needed only to serve the 12 pasengers that the vessel carries . The smaller vessels carry only 4 passengers each but this is not wholly a matter of size , for another vessel in the fleet , propelled by diesel engines , carries 12 passengers even though its deadweight tonnage is only 7,630 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying 4.3 times as heavy a load as another may need a crew only 1.19 times as large ( or , if the extra man referred to is included , 1.22 times as large ) as that of the smaller vessel . The figures are only a little less striking if total maximum vessel weight ( displacement loaded ) is used instead of deadweight tonnage as the measure of size , for on this basis the larger vessel is 3.9 times as big as the smaller ones . The diesel vessels in the Pan-Ore fleet bring out the same point . The one already mentioned , with a deadweight tonnage of 7,630 , is the smallest and has a crew of 35 . The largest , with a deadweight tonnage of 28,000 , has a crew of 44 . Each carries 12 passengers . For purposes of comparison , an adjustment should be made , for a mechanic and an extra wiper required for diesel // engines are dispensed with on the smaller vessel not because it is small but because it is operated on a very short " shuttle " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the smaller vessel for this reason , the crews are 37 and 44 . Again , a crew only 1.19 times as large ( 1.26 without the adjustment ) is needed for a vessel with several times-3.7 times in this case ? the total carrying capacity of the smaller vessel . The number of men in a towboat crew is not wholly unrelated to the towboat 's capacity but , as in the case of ocean vessels , it is very far from being altogether variable with capacity . By way of illustration , 7 of the towboats operated by Federal Barge Lines have a crew of 17 each , yet their horsepower , which determines how heavy a tow they can propel at a given speed , varies from 1,800 to 3,600 . The variability of the crew with the size of the actual tow is probably even smaller than its variability with capacity , for barges can be added to a tow , up to the limits of the towboat 's capacity , with no change whatever in the size of the crew . In air transportation a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most often stated in terms of its maximum allowable take-off gross weight , which will be referred to in this discussion simply as its gross weight . The functions performed by the pilot and the copilot are necessary whether the airplane has a gross weight of 27,000 pounds as in the case of a DC-3 or 47,000 pounds as in that of a Convair-340 . Only if the gross weight exceds 80,000 pounds does the federal government generally require a third crew member , a flight engineer . The DC-6 , with a gross weight of 95,200 pounds , therefore has a crew of 3 , but this number remains unchanged for a DC-7 , although its gross weight is 122,000 pounds . The same underlying principle applies in rail transportation . Whether a train is large or small , the functions of the engine crew require no more than one engineman and one fireman . // Many railroads question the need for a fireman on a diesel freight locomotive , but the requirement has been established , at least temporarily , by union agreement and in some states by statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cars to the train does not require any addition to the 2-man engine crew . The term " train crew " is sometimes used to denote the crew members other than the engine crew . The train crew includes a conductor , who takes care of ( among other things ) the paper work . Generally there are 2 brakemen , whether the train is very short or is well above average length . However , an additional brakeman may be required if the train is of more than a certain length and enters a state having a " full crew " law . In some cases , the extra brakeman is taken on just before the train enters one of these states . It is seen , then , that the variability of engineand-train crew size is extremely limited . In the case of a highway transport unit , the crew is almost always 1 man or 2 men working in shifts . The latter arrangement is made feasible by tractor cabs so designed that one driver can recline while the other is driving . Meaningful comparisons between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transportation and a corresponding ratio in another mode , even apart from the effects of differences in rates of compensation , can be made only after several adjustments in the raw data . For example , ocean vessels have to carry 3 sets of workers for those functions that require 24-hour activity . A train , or an airplane on a domestic flight , ordinarily has only 1 set of workers on board . The air or rail carrier employs additional crewmen , not merely those that are on transport units at the moment , but between their periods of activity they do not live on the transport unit ; a comparison between an ocean vessel and an airplane or train with respect to the number of crewmen on board is therefore misleading . Some towboats are operated with 2 sets of watchstanders on board . // Their 12-hour day is brought to approximately an 8-hour basis by additional time off on full pay ; consequently , some members of the crew are not on board for a given trip . If one begins with numbers of crewmen on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of an ocean vessel , and by 2 in the case of one of the towboats referred to , before a comparison of the size of the crew with that of an airplane or train crew can be undertaken . In addition , the isolation of an ocean vessel at sea requires that certain workers be kept on board whose equivalents in land transportation would be maintenance-ofequipment men rather than crewmen ; such workers would have to be excluded in a comparison . It is interesting that even on an intermodal basis fewer crewmen in proportion to transport-unit size are needed on larger units than on smaller ones . Thus , air and highway transportation , the modes with the smallest transport units , have by far the lowest ratio of size of unit to number of crewmen . They move , typically , from 15 to 30 tons of transport-unit weight per crew member . In rail or ocean transportation ( after appropriate adjustments in the latter case for the factors noted in the preceding paragraph ) , a corresponding figure would be upward of 300 tons . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such comparisons between air transportation and other modes . In terms of crew man-hours per transport-unit ton-mile , an airplane may be roughly in the same general class as a train or an ocean vessel . But the small payload capacity of an airplane in proportion to its weight keeps the number of crew man-hours per capacity ton-mile relatively high . The disadvantage of air transportation in this respect is augmented by the relatively high rates of compensation of airplane crewmen . Akin to the saving in crew labor resulting from the operation of large transport units is the saving in other labor that depends either on the total number of crewmen or on the number of // transport units . So far as the operation of relatively large units reduces these numbers , it tends to reduce the work of crew supervisors and trainers , of dispatchers , of traffic-control men , and so on . Fuller use of power . In some cases , another source of economy lies in the operation of a larger combination unit that does not require more , or more powerful , power units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its trains while not exceeding the capacity of one of its diesel units for each train . This permits the railroad to handle a given amount of traffic with relatively few locomotive units ? and with relatively few locomotiveunit miles , thus effecting a reduction in expenses ( absolutely or in ratio to traffic ) for fuel , lubricants , and locomotive maintenance . This factor , as well as the economies previously indicated , may be illustrated by a recent change in operations on a 110-mile railroad branch line in Iowa . The railroad had operated a daily ( except Sunday ) train in each direction . Recently it obtained permission from the state authorities to change to tri-weekly service . This will presumably increase , possibly double , the average size of its trains , which on the daily basis averaged 10 cars each . Because 20 cars on moderate grades are still within the capacity of one diesel unit , the railroad is able to release , for use elsewhere , one of the diesel units formerly required on this branch . It anticipates annual out-of-pocket savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than half of this amount is a saving in crew expense of $87.86 per day , for the crew of 5 men that operated a small daily train would also operate a larger tri-weekly train . The other elements in the expense reduction are chiefly consequences of the reduction in locomotive-unit miles . Increased capacity of way . The immediately realizable capacity of a way , as distinguished from its ultimate or theoretical // capacity , depends partly on the actual pattern of operation on the way . An important element in this pattern is the size of the transport units . By augmenting the realizable capacity of a way , by bringing it closer to the full or ultimate capacity , larger transport units confer two benefits ? provided that traffic is available for utilization of the augmented realizable capacity . First , they cause the constant cost of the way to be shared by a relatively large quantity of traffic and thus reduce that cost per unit of traffic . Second , they permit the furnisher of the way to postpone , or perhaps even to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accommodation of the available traffic . Before coming to the reason why relatively large transport units tend to increase the realizable capacity of a way , one may note that " capacity , " whether realizable or ultimate , is a somewhat elastic term . In using it , one ordinarily means the maximum amount of traffic that can move without violation of certain safety requirements and standards of service and without excessive maintenance expense . If these requirements are relaxed , the capacity may be stretched . Also , the meaning of way capacity ? the amount of traffic that can move on the way ? depends on the meaning of the term " traffic . " This word has several meanings , each of them valuable for certain purposes . It can be conceived either in terms of a quantity moved , or in terms of such a quantity multiplied by the distance it is moved . But what quantity ? It may be the total weight of the transport units under consideration , usually called gross weight . Or , if they are combination units , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in rail transportation this is very close to what is sometimes called trailing gross weight . Or it may be the weight of the freight , often called net weight ? or of the revenue freight alone , to the exclusion of " company " freight ( freight transported for the carrier 's own use ) and any other freight carried free of charge . In passenger transporta94 FUNDAMENTALS OF TRANSPORTATION tion it may be either the number of passengers or the weight of the passengers and their baggage . It may even refer to the number of vehicles , a meaning which would of course be invalid in a comparison of the amount of traffic of one mode of transportation with that of another . Capacity is often stated in terms of traffic density . In studies of traffic and of way utilization , both actual density and capacity density may be important . When one states the density of traffic on a way , one must of course have in mind a definite meaning of the quantity that is being moved . One may then determine the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain period or , on a capacity basis , the amount that could have passed . This is density of a sort . It is the density of traffic at that point and , in a sense , represents the traffic density of the stretch of way between the nearest entrance or exit on either side of the point , for all the traffic that passes one point also passes every other point on this stretch . But what if one wishes to measure the actual or greatest possible density of a way , or section of a way , on which traffic does or may vary from one segment to another ? In such a case , the distance element must be introduced . One must think in terms of ton-miles or vehicle-miles rather than of tons or vehicles , and of miles of way rather than of just a point . Density for a given period may then be stated in terms of ton-miles or vehicle-miles per mile of way . Railroad studies frequently use **26;631;TOOLONG figures , generally on an annual basis . The ton-miles in these studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross-tonmiles ( entire train except locomotive ) , net ton-miles ( freight ) , or freight revenue ton-miles . If the capacity of a way in gross ton-miles ? that is , total transport-unit ton-miles ? is increased , presumably the capacity in those other ton-miles that are parts of the total will also be increased . One may therefore ask , as a fundamental question , // whether or not an increase in the weight of transport units will tend to augment a way 's capacity in gross ton-miles . Obviously , if the same number of larger ( heavier ) transport units can move as smaller ones , and the distances remain the same , the fact that the units are larger will increase the ton-mile capacity of the way . But what if , because the units are larger , not so many of them can move so many miles in a given period ? Then the effect on capacity will depend on the proportion between the increase in size per unit and the decrease in unit-mile capacity . If , for example , the weight per unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the total capacity will be 1% times as great ( 3 x 3 = 1% ) . If larger units are operated , fewer of them , as a rule , can pass a given point in a given period and the unit-mile capacity of a way is reduced . But , as in the example given , this reduction is generally less than proportional to the increase in weight per unit . Consequently , larger units tend to effect greater realizable capacity . To grasp the reasons for this , one would do well to start with the fundamental principle that the number of transport units transiting a stretch of track or lane in a given period depends on their speed , their length , and the distance between them . The last two may be regarded as one factor . In an important theoretical sense , what is moving along at , say , 50 miles per hour is the length of the transport unit plus the necessary distance between the unit 's rear end and the front end of the unit following . Because this combined length-and-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front end of the next succeeding unit ( at minimum safe distance ) , it may be called the " front-to-front " distance . The number of uniform units in single file that can pass a given point at a uniform speed in an hour is their speed divided by their front-to-front distance . Thus , if each train is one mile long , and a distance of 2 miles is required between trains , and the // speed is 30 miles per hour , 10 trains can pass in an hour . Does the weight of the units affect this number ? Only so far as it affects their speed or their front-to-front distance , for these are the factors that directly determine the number of units . To understand the effect of weight on speed and on front-to-front distance , one must consider the vital element known as stop ( or stopping ) distance . As indicated in the preceding chapter , this is the distance within which the unit can be brought to a complete stop . The concept may be refined as either the driver stop distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of stop distance dealt with in the preceding chapter . It is the distance from the point at which the driver ( or other person responsible ) has an opportunity to perceive a need for stopping to the point where the transport unit comes to rest . The mechanical stop distance extends from the point at which the braking or other stopping controls start to move to the point where the unit comes to rest . The difference between these two stop distances is the perception-and-reaction distance . Another distinction , of great importance in railroading , is that between a routine or " service " application of brakes and an emergency application . In the latter , the train is stopped in as short a distance as possible despite some possible damage to the equipment or its contents . The stop distance required for a service application of brakes on a railroad train is usually con-ceived as a mechanical stop distance . This omission of percep-tion-reaction distance should be considered in the light of the facts that a service application is generally made in response to a signal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches for them ; that on some lines he has visual or audible signals in the cab itself ; and that on some lines a train that // passes a stop signal is automatically braked to a stop . Allowance of one second for reaction to a signal would add only 88 feet to the stop distance of a train moving at 60 miles an hour ? possibly 2 per cent or so of the total driver stop distance . In trucking , on the contrary , the mechanical stop distance is relatively short ( a few hundred feet at most ) , the need to stop is often unsignalled , and the perception-and-reaction distance therefore represents a substantial proportion of the total driver stop distance . Different trains , or the same train on stretches of track having different speed limits , will of course have different stop distances . The longest such distance , under service application of brakes , on a given line of track is the basis for determination of the shortest block length that can be considered safe . A block is a section of track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already in the block , the next train must stay out or may in some cases enter with caution at slow speed . The length of a block must be at least a little greater than the longest stop distance . One large railroad , for example , determined its present standard block length by adding a tolerance of 20 per cent to its longest stop distance . Although the longest stop distance plus a reasonable tolerance provides a minimum safe distance between trains moving at their regular speeds , and therefore indicates a minimum block length , a somewhat longer block length may be established as a means of reducing the frequency of train stops and slow-downs . In this way , although perhaps with some loss in traffic density , the transit time of trains can be reduced , a result that may be considered necessary for competitive purposes . A certain railroad , for example , with a longest stop distance of about 7,000 feet , established a standard block length of 10,000 feet , a length adopted also by several other railroads . Another // advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with consequent economy in plant and maintenance . With these considerations in mind , one may return to the question of the effect of the weight of transport units on their speed and front-to-front distance and therefore on the number of them that can transit a given stretch of way in a given period . Weight affects these factors chiefly because the mechanical stop distance tends to vary with the weight . Increased weight there-fore tends to increase the minimum safe distance between units , which is one of the two elements in front-to-front distance . If , however , the operator wishes to avoid the stop-distance increase , it may do so by reducing the speed of the unit . Because the mechanical stop distance tends to vary approximately with the square of the speed , a relatively large decrease in stop distance can be effected by a relatively small decrease in speed. * The relationship between transport-unit weight and stop dis-tance requires closer examination . If other factors are unchanged , the mechanical stop distance ( except the small part of it oc-casioned by brake lag ) varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , other factors affecting stop distance are often related to the weight in such a way that the stop distance varies much less than in proportion to weight . An especially important instance of this is the increase of the weight of a land transport unit by the addition of more vehicles . Each vehicle has brake equipment , so that the stop distance of the transport unit will be only slightly affected by the increase in weight . Also , two vehicles of substantially different weights should be , // and generally are , differently equipped so that each has braking more suitable to its weight than to the weight of the other . This braking difference partly or wholly counterbalances the effect of the weight difference on the stop distances . The important relationship here is the braking ratio ? that is , the ratio of the brake-shoe pressure to the weight of , say , the railroad car to which it is applied . Under standards promulgated by the Association of American Railroads , the braking ratio should be not less than 18 per cent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 per cent for empties . ( A maximum braking ratio for empties is indicated because too high a ratio would cause the wheels to slide excessively during brake applications . ) If a car 's gross-to-tare ratio ? that is , the ratio of its weight fully loaded to its weight empty ? is greater than 75-to-18 , no given brake-shoe pressure would be at once 18 per cent or more of the weight loaded and 75 per cent or less of the weight empty . Such a car may nevertheless conform to the standard by the use of a special " empty-and-load " brake , as distinguished from the ordinary " single-capacity " brake . An emptyand-load brake exerts either of two pressures , according to the weight of the car at a given time . Some cars designed for the carriage of ore have a gross-to-tare ratio of about 6 and are therefore equipped with these brakes . Tests have shown that the stop distance of a heavy truck tends to be longer if the truck is empty than if it is loaded . The reason for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out of control if an attempt is made to stop it short . Tests have also shown that the mechanical stop distance of trucks , although affected by the gross weight of the trucks , varies much less than in direct proportion to that weight , and that this is true whether trucks in general are considered or only those in a specific maximum-weight category . It should be noted also that perception-and-reaction distance , which is a quantitatively im-
