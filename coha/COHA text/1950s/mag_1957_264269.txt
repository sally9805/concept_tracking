A short stroll from the gutted hulk of Berlin 's old Reichstag one blustery day last week , a young German girl stepped resolutely forward , smashed a bottle of German wine against a brand-new building set on the banks of the River Spree , proclaimed in a clear voice . " I christen you the Congress Hall in memory of Benjamin Franklin . " Thus was opened Berlin 's newest and most venturesome building , a joint project of the U.S. , the West German government and the city of Berlin . Designed as a cultural center where plays , music , debates and symposiums will be held , the new structure has a 1,260-seat auditorium , conference halls and restaurant . It was not only a new outpost for freedom of speech in the cold war , but the most talked-about structure in Berlin . <P> " This hall is dedicated to one of the great freedoms-freedom of expression , " said its designer , U.S. Architect Hugh Stubbins , 45 . " Its form was inspired by an attempt to express that great purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Architect Stubbins designed a thin concrete shell roof slung between two bowed-out arches , set underneath as a stabilizer a multipurpose auditorium that by his own admission looked " like a teacup on stilts . " <P> Berliners had other names for it . Watching the structure grow , they jokingly dubbed it " the Dulleseum , " and compared it to a " hooded owl peeking over a fence " or " a pregnant butterfly . " But once completed , the daring structure , with its gleaming white concrete roof , soft rose and blue walls , got rave reviews . Der Tag called it " a symphony of colors and forms " ; the Socialist Telegraf headlined the news , WONDER BUILDING AT THE SPREE ; BERLIN 'S NEW SYMBOL . <P> As a housewarming present , the U.S. sponsored the Congress Hall 's first week 's program : dedication ceremony with speeches by Clare Boothe Luce and Ambassador David K. Bruce , a Julliard String Quartet concert , a performance by Dancer Martha Graham , and seven American one-act plays . The show was pulling East Berliners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall itself , along with the nearby Hansa district housing projects by such designers as Brazil 's Oscar Niemeyer , U.S. Architect Walter Gropius and Finland 's Alvar Aalto ( TIME , April 30 , 1956 ) . Using the new buildings as the site for a summer-long architectural fair , West Berliners had already attracted 725,000 visitors , including one group of 33 Polish architects , proved that in the struggle for Berlin good architecture is a good weapon .
