r had changed into a different woman with exceedingly strong views on such delicate questions as where to live , how to decorate and manage a house , and which of her husband 's friends were worth keeping up with . It was pure luck that he had agreed with her . But he considered that a man of his age and experience would have more foresight in a second choice . He began to look round almost as soon as his wife was buried . He wanted above all a good housekeeper and a companion for his daughter  --  he was accustomed to good housekeeping and he distrusted nurses , even the most expensive . And he told himself that even from a financial point of view , the plan was justified . " With wages at their highest and service at its worst , a competent wife is actually a first-class investment . " AN D one day , by good luck , as he said after- wards , he met Daisy Bill at Wimbledon . He had barely settled himself on his stool in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's shirt , about three yards further down the row , called out loudly , " Bill , Bill , " and then , " Daisy . " Catto as a small boy had known the Bill family very well . For three summers running they had shared the same lodgings at the seaside , and he had got on very well with Daisy especially , nearest to him in age . He had even fallen a good deal in love with Daisy at fifteen , during their last holiday together . He thought , even before he identified the girl , " Daisy Bill , could it be the old Daisy , and not married ? If Daisy really is n't married , then what about her ? The right age , too old for babies , I do n't want a rival to poor little Jean , and Daisy was really a very nice girl in a very nice way  --  good-natured , healthy , and she would probably have money too . As far as I can remember all the Bill girls had something coming from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , half stood up , and after a moment recognized Daisy . " She must be that huge red-faced woman with the cigarette-holder shaped like a pipe . She could n't be anyone else with that nose and those eyes . Yes , there she is waving to her friend . " He excused himself to the neighbors and edged past them to present himself . Daisy knew him at once . She cried out in avoice to be heard ten yards away , " Good Lord , Tommy , Tom Cat ! " and wrung his fingers in a powerful clasp . " But how wonderful , you have n't changed a bit . How extraordinary . What a bit of luck . You must join us . " The neighbors in the queue , discreetly interested and pleased , with that almost family feeling which belongs to the Wimbledon queue , made way for his stool , and he joined the Bill party . It consisted now of Daisy , a little , thin , sharp woman who turned out to be a celebrated authoress , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis star , a county champion . Catto had been shocked by the change in Daisy 's looks , but her greeting reassured him . He was reminded again of his old love , her easy good nature , her freedom from all those airs which in a girl of sixteen he most detested , touchiness and sudden changes of mood . He had told himself then that , with all her charm , she was as reliable a friend as any of the boys at school . " Good heavens , " Daisy said , breathing tobacco in his face , " do you remember those walks along the shore ? And how you hated the kids for trailing after us ? " She gave a loud laugh and then , dropping his hand , turned to the champion and exclaimed in a serious tone , as one who takes up again the more important affairs of life , " So you do n't think much of Seixas ' service ? " And the pair continued their tennis gossip with enthusiasm . Catto might not have existed for either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time , dismissed Catto with a single glance , and then , with a twist of her little pursed mouth and a droop of her eyelids , fell into a gloomy meditation which made her all at once ten years older and gave her a sad but distinguished beauty . Catto had no recollection of his jealousy ; Daisy seemed to have a more accurate memory of their affair . But he was already sorry that he had so impulsively presented himself . He observed his old friend with a rueful amuse-ment . " Yes , steady as a boy and now a regular fellow . " He recoiled from this bluff Daisy . It was obvious why she had never married . And neither of her sisters , even if they were unmarried , had ever attracted him . The languid , fragile , lovely Letty , always being rescued from crabs and wrapped up from the cold ; the rat-tailed Francie , at six , with her red button of a nose , hurling herself into the seas and making love to the very fishermen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersed for lunch , Daisy recalled her manners and became even more hearty , asked after his family , expressed a manly sympathy for his loss , and told of her own father 's death . But her mother was still at the old place , she would so like to see him again . Why not come out next weekend ? There was to be quite an amusing party to dinner . C A-r-ro accepted these attentions in their own spirit and resolved not to go to dinner on any account . Why waste time on the Bills if Daisy was not a suitable prospect ? He was put out when Mrs. Bill wrote to him . She also expressed her sympathy , a cheerful sympathy : " These things must happen , one has to take them , " and she pressed him to come to dinner . " You remember Hunter 's ? It 's just the same , and Daisy tells me so are you . Is n't that nice ? It 's quite encouraging in these days when everything else seems to get worse and worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose they ca n't be blamed for being so flat when the newspapers are so full of bombs . Though I ca n't imagine why everyone should go off so terribly before the bombs even tick , or whatever they do when they drop . " And in a postscript she wrote , " Quite a small party , about eight , do n't dress . Mrs. Mair is coming , who lost her husband last year in that plane crash , and the Offer girl who used to be so fond of you . " Catto seemed to hear a voice , a rattling little voice like a cracked dinner bell . He had not heard it for thirty years . in fact since his last holiday with the Bills , before he had gone to the university and they had gone to Switzerland for Letty 's health . He had not paid much attention to it then . Mrs. Bill had not talked much with boys of his age , nor , indeed , with her own children . She had been preoccupied with her handsome husband and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequented the house . Even at the seaside her life had been a series of parties , chiefly on yachts . The Bills had taken rooms at Clarksfoot , small and remote , unfashionable and even uncouth , with itsmining workers , its Welsh Bethels singing hymns on the beach , because of her friend , Lord S. , who kept his big yacht there . S. asked her to his parties in harbor but did not expect her to go cruising . Mrs. Bill was a very bad sailor . Her stories of her own feelings on the sea were among her most amusing . The voice tinkled with laughter in the background of Catto 's mind . But now that it came back to him in the cadences of the note , so neatly written in a minute , precise hand , he found , to his surprise , that he liked his memory of Mrs. Bill , as of someone always gay , lively , good-tempered , and tolerant . " Perhaps she did not trouble much with us children , but she never worried us either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then this widow , Mrs. Mair ? I know Mrs. Bill was a bit of a matchmaker . But why not  --  a widow might be the answer for me . She 'd know the ropes and would n't have fantastic expectations , and yet she would appreciate the solid advantages of a husband and being on good terms with him . And this Offer girl too , she must be somewhere near my age if she was fond of me thirty years ago . " H E ACCEPTED Mrs. Bill 's invitation ; and it was true that the house had not changed . But the neighborhood had . The place had been a farm , and Theodore Bill had even kept it as a farm , without a bailiff , losing money every year . Now the farm house with its garden stood incongruously in a vast new suburb which was actually named after it , Hunter 's Green . Catto , opening the old wooden gate , a farm crate still , had the sense of one who finds an unexpected treasure and , at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodies of the old saints are said to do when you dig them up . He had loved Hunter 's Green where Ihe had ridden his first pony , and had his first passionate love , with the slim , lovely girl who had put him over the jumps . With Daisy , in short . And where was that Daisy now ? She was less than an existence , for the actual Daisy was already making faint and unreliable even that sweet memory that had been a vivid existence . And now Hunter 's Green , the old Hunter 's Green , the solid bricks , the immense elms , the coach-house with its dovecot , mysteriously disintegrated before his very eyes . Hunter 's Green had never pretended to beauty . It had always been a plain house  --  square , three-storied , with a slate roof a little too small , and a long lean-to conservatory . In the farm among its trees , with the cows grazing opposite the windows , this plainness had been a charm . It seemed to say , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Theodore and Tottie Bill were anything but plain country people . But for that very reason , they had appreciated Hunter 's Green , and carefully preserved its honest want of make-up . B UT now the rough five-bar gate , the coarse grass in the lawn which was much too small for a paddock , a minute haycock in one corner of it , and the rusty pump at the angle of the wall , looked false , stagy . They had indeed become false by being preserved into a different age . Cato went in expecting more disappointment of the same kind , relics of the past that spoiled and obscured the past by their meretricious survival . He was delighted , therefore , by Mrs. Bill . The little woman seemed no older . She was the same  --  pretty , vivacious , with her fine thin nose , her dead white skin , her black eyes that sparkled all the more for the contrast of her cheeks , her cracked voice , her high Edwardian handshake . " Ah , but this is an occasion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you smell the stairs on the Naiad ? I have never been able to use rubber since poor S. died . It makes me cry and it makes me seasick , and those are two things that simply ca n't go together . Some people drink claret with oysters , yes I know , I met such a man and he was n't a character part . In fact , it was old Roger Kent . " And turning to another guest , " Do you remember Roger in ' Mrs. Tanqueray ? ' " She had turned from Catto , as Daisy had turned from him , to a more responsive audience , and seeing her white curly head from behind , he reflected , " But she was dark then ? she must be seventy . I think she has n't changed because I 've been getting old too . And certainly she 's kept her features . " The dinner was quite good , the company distinguished , if not of the first distinction . A well-known Shakespearian actor , scholarly and earnest like all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old critic with a broken nose , like a boxer 's nose ; and the vicar , a big red-faced man , full of good stories , and , Catto would have said , old port , a type that he had not met for years , and enjoyed . " A sensible stout fellow , " he thought , " and probably a fine preacher . I wish we had more of them in the Church . Good fellows with their feet on the ground . " Mrs. Mair , a well-known women 's editor under her maiden name , arrived late with a new husband , and the Offer girl , a thin pale creature of about seventeen , enthusiastic about ballet , had never even heard of Catto . He remembered that Mrs. Bill was celebrated for her inconsequence . It had been one of her charms and , because it had been a charm , he enjoyed it again . Francie was the eighth at the table . That is to say , she did not appear till after the soup , when , flushed , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped into her place between the young bridegroom and the critic 's wife . AS THE vicar sat opposite Mrs. Bill it was impossible to alternate the sexes , and Catto , on her left , sat next to the critic . r No one explained Francie , or her sudden appearance . Catto was left to infer , after some reflection , that this thick-set woman , with gray streaks in her hair , must be the youngest Bill daughter , Frank , Frankie , Francie . He could not recognize her at all . But when she disappeared again with the chickens , and came in soon after the ice pudding , he perceived that she was acting as cook . The maid who waited was no doubt a daily woman , possibly a waiter hired only for the party . And when the party moved to the veranda , overlooking the bogus paddock and the decorator 's haycock , he noticed that Francie not only arranged her mother 's cushions but mixed the vicar 's whisky and fetched the actor 's pipe from his room . The actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like an old family friend , and when Francie , noticing that he fumbled in his pocket , silently disappeared and brought the pipe , he did not interrupt his description of Bernhardt 's absurd masterpiece in " L'Aiglon , " he received the pipe with his fingers as a man at table who has dropped a fork takes a new one from the waiter . " Or a father from a daughter , " Catto thought . " But she calls him Mr. Maxton . He ca n't be so familiar . Yet she knew what he wanted and where to find it . " Ni ) suddenly he had a new recollection of the old Francie , the child of six who had always been so dirty , noisy , always falling into the water , tearing her frocks , so often in the way when he had wanted to be alone with the lovely , so friendly Daisy . He recalled a general cry of , " Frankie , Frankie , " and the small girl with flying tangled hair tearing madly along the corridor ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettiest in a white serge frock , standing on the stairs above a group of men and saying with a charming bend of her head , " But do n't bother , I 'm absolutely fated to lose things . Frankie will find it for me , " and then again , " Frankie is the practical one , are n't you , Frankie ? " And again lie saw , at forty-eight , an angle of his old friends that , at eighteen , had made only an impression on his memory , none on his observation . Daisy had been so easy , so friendly , yes , and Mrs. Bill 's tinkling voice had usually been heard by the children in these cheerful laments . She was always needing something fetched or found . Her good-humor confessed , " I 'm a nuisance , I know , but you 'll forgive me because I forgive everyone else . " And Frankie had been the practical one . Had they given her the character and made her a family slave , was she really fit for nothing else ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , silent as usual , half hidden behind her mother 's chair , listening to the actor and the critic discussing Bernhardt , he thought , amused by the recollection , " Yes , how she trailed after me  --  after anything in trousers . How she would throw herself into my arms and say , ' But Tom , you have n't kissed me good night . ' And I should think she 's a real woman still  --  rather shy and dull perhaps but the tomboy has quite disappeared . " And suddenly he thought , " Why not Francie , could I do better ? A kind soul , modest , simple , pretty capable too if she cooked that dinner . Of course , she 's a bit young  --  she ca n't be more than thirty-six . There could be a baby , and that 's a complication I particularly wanted to avoid . Of course , one could make a bargain  --  babies barred . It 's common enough in second marriages . " He reflected a moment on this tricky point . But like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf in life , he had also a strong sense of what is fair in dealing with others . " No , " he thought , " if she wanted a baby I should have to give her one . On the other hand , youth does have some advantages . She 'd stand up better to the job . " He looked again at Francie , and caught her at a plainer moment . The lamp shone on her nose and the prominent forehead , a strand of damp hair , well steamed from the kitchen , was lying limp against her cheek . But Catto rallied . " Damn it , I 'm not a boy . What do looks matter ? What 1 need is a good homemaker  --  someone to take an interest in Jean  --  domestic competence and peace . " E SOUGHT some private talk with her , but this was difficult to manage . Rain was falling in thick heavy lines and the cars could not come down to the door be-cause , at Hunter 's Green , as in a proper farm house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , with a narrow brick path to the front porch . The party stood crowded in the hall , looking out disgustedly , while Francie was busy with hats and coats . When she brought him his coat he turned smiling and said , " Frances , Frankie , do you remember Clarksfoot ? " But Mrs. Bill interrupted with a remark to the world , " Dear me , there used to be a carriage umbrella in the hall . But it seems to have lost itself . Everything in this house gets itself lost . " Francie , still silent , ran for the carriage umbrella in the back passage and escorted the guests to their cars . Catto , who had come by train and taxi , had a lift in the critic 's car . He made one more attempt to speak to Francie from the back window . " Thank you , Francie , do you remember how you used to go round at bedtime and wish us all good night ? " The girl had turned away at a call from the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him . But Catto was a determined man . He wrote to Mrs. Bill , thanking her for a delightful evening , and asked her to the theater " with my old friend Francie . " And when Mrs. Bill refused on account of an engagement , he took the train again to Hunter 's Green and called . you , Francie ? week . " " Do you mind if I finish this border  --  I 've got so behind with the weeds . " " No  --  let me help you . " " Oh you could n't  --  you 'll /get filthy . " - " I can wash . " " Are you sure you know which are weeds ? " " I see you 're still practical . " The woman looked at him in surprise . He explained his point , as a joke , but she did not smile . She reflected and said at last , " I wonder ? " " You were a quaint little thing at six . " But she was weeding again , he saw only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " " Not really . " She stood up again and looked at him intently . She was obviously curious , she felt that his visit had some purpose beyond a mere call . She shook her head , " Mother says that you were Daisy 's great friend . " " I liked to think I was yours too . You never let me leave the house without a kiss . " " Oh well , at six . " She dismissed this carelessly . She was not at all embarrassed , as Catto had expected . She showed no shyness . Indeed now that lie had been able to talk to her , he felt that she had grown up with something of the Bill poise . She asked him abruptly , " What do you do , Mr. Catto ? Tell fne about yourself . " " That 's a very dull story . I 'm a printer , a widower , with a young daughter  --  forty-eight years old . Really there 's nothing more to tell . " " Is it long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , eighteen months . But it seems a very Iong time indeed . We were very happy  --  I am a lonely man , Francie  --  a very lonely man . Men like me who have been happily married and then widowed , suffer a very special kind of loneliness . " The woman looked at him and the wrinkles in her forehead were very noticeable . - Yes , I can imagine it . I 'm sorry . But then you did have all that happiness . " " It 's a danger . " " Yes , it 's a danger . But worth it . Or do n't you think so ? Perhaps now ? " " Oh yes , tremendously worth it . " " In fact , in spite of everything , you 've been ? " " Yes , I 've been lucky . I was always rather lucky . 1 was lucky to know you when I was a boy . " " Me ? " " I mean the family as a whole . Yes , you too . You were rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman looked at him and her expression was critical . She was taking a new view of this middle-aged man who made such rapid advances . Then she said that she must really get the weeding done , and set to work . No word was said for twenty minutes and the silence itself was expressive . It said plainly that there was a situation . " I 've been too sudden , " Catto said to himself . " She does n't seem shy  --  at thirty-six , she knows how to manage her feelings . But she 's timid and wary . " - The bed finished , they straightened up together face to face , and the girl smiled in a broad and frank manner . Her whole fare expressed a personal interest . She had settled something with herself . " Come Mr. Catto , you need tea , or a drink . " " Why Mr. Catto ? " " Well , what did I call you ? " " I was Tom to you all . " " Come , Tom , we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather her basket . For the moment , Catto was afraid that he had been too enterprising . He did not want to commit himself to the girl before he knew her better . He had , as we have seen , as well as prudence , a strong sense of responsibility . But the woman at once recovered her practical air . She had placed Catto to her satisfaction as a nice middle-aged man eager to renew his childhood memories . They talked of the days at Clarksfoot , they exchanged news . She told how Mrs. Bill alter her husband 's death had lost most of her money and sold the land , how Daisy loved traveling and seldom appeared at home , how Letty needed special treatment and how much it cost . He told her about his marriage , about Jean , and how hard he thought it for a girl of nine to lose her mother . That he had seriously considered marrying again , on her account alone . " I 'm sure- you 're right , " Francie said , " if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . " " A widow perhaps , without children , who wanted a child to care for . " " I 'm not so sure . A younger woman might be a better companion . " " A widow could be quite young . There are lots of young widows . What about war widows ? " " It 's the person that matters . I do n't see why she need be a widow . " " Oh no , of course . " " Or why I should n't have another baby if she were young enough . " later , when Catto actually proposed in many words that Francie understood him . " You really want to marry me ? " " Yes , yes . I 've been trying to tell you so for the Iast fortnight . " " Well , I did wonder sometimes but I did n't like to think ? " " But you have n't answered me yet . " " But do n't you see ? " " What ? " " Why I did n't like to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad laugh which brought all her wrinkles and made her little eyes disappear , " of course marry you . " The laugh disappeared and she looked suddenly very serious . All at once Catto understood that the headlong Francie of thirty years before was still there . He was much startled . He had not expected so passionate a kiss , so eager an embrace . Mrs. Bill was greatly amused by the news . She congratulated Catto and said , laughing , " Sir Galahad to the rescue , or is it Perseus ? But I 'm not really a monster , you know , and Francie loves her chains . She adores a fuss . " Catto , taken by surprise , found himself turning red . He did not know what to answer . But Mrs. Bill had dashed on at once , " Lefty will hate you , but it wo n't do Letty any harm to take a little exercise . " He received a most friendly letter from Daisy in Venezuela , who said how glad she was to see that her darling Francie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some life of her own . She wanted Catto to " keep mother at bay , for Francie 's sake , or you 'll have no peace . " completely remodeled kitchen , and all Mrs. Bill 's old friends sent autographed copies of their irrorks  --  published twenty or thirty years before , period sensations now wearing as strange a look as the hats and skirts of that ancient world in which they had achieved their distinction . Catto had already arranged for a honeymoon in Paris . His first honeymoon had been in Paris . Francie had hoped for Italy , but she enjoyed Paris enormously as a bride . And she was deeply apologetic when the month they had planned was cut a week short because Daisy came back from Jamaica , in a banana boat , with a mysterious illness called Daisy 's fever , and the Cattos had to hurry home to look after her . But Catto could not complain that Daisy looked upon his home as a refuge in time of trouble . Francie nursed her for six weeks before Catto got a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on only when she was broke . " Do n't let her kill Francie , " she wrote . " Daisy has always treated Francie as her private and personal slave . Have you tried the gold cure for the fever ? A check , I 've found , is far the best prescription . " Daisy had been complaining every day of all the wonderful holidays she was missing by this unlucky illness , and Catto now offered her a loan of twenty pounds to take advantage of an invitation to Finland . She left the next morning by milk-float to catch a trawler whose captain was an old Bombay friend . Catto , relieved , told himself that Daisy would not come very often . But he protested when Francie confessed that she had engaged herself to stay three days at Hunter 's Green in order to cook for her mother 's traditional Easter party . He wrote to Mrs. Bill suggesting that he should advertise for a temporary cook . But she answered none was required . " Francie seems to think she ought to come but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is . She does just as little as she dares . " She addressed the note to Gala-had Catto Esq. , and signed herself " the monster . " Catto took it to Francie and said , " You see , your mother does n't even want you . " " But it was Mummie told me that Mrs. Jones threatened to give notice if she asked five people to stay . And now she 's asked seven people . And you know if we lose Mrs. Jones we 'll never get another up to Mummie 's standards . " " Then she 'll have to change her standards  --  like other people . " F RANC  --  E was silent , as usual in these arguments . But a certain obstinate desperation in her forehead and chin seemed to ask , " How ? It 's easy to say , but how do you do it ? " And she went to the work  --  Mrs. Bill 's celebrated party was again a great success , for which she received much praise , even a graceful notice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not send for Francie ; either she did not need her or she had been offended by Catto 's note . Francie believed that she was offended , and it worried her . " Mummie is so sensitive about being a nuisance , " she said . " And of course she 'll never tell you when she 's hurt . " " She 's no right to be hurt . " Francie 's wrinkles deepened . " It 's not very nice for her , living alone . I should hate it . " Catto did not answer that Francie was off the point . He told himself that women have their own methods of argument and that , above all , he must not start a quarrel with Frantic about her mother . That situation was too foolish as well as too vulgar . How easy for a sensible man to avoid it . And it seemed that Mrs. Bill , hurt or not , meant to leave Francie alone . F RANCIE 'S first baby was born in December , a very cold December ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Letty asking if she could take the elder girl to school , she herSelf had a migraine ; and on the day after she got up , Mrs. Bill telephoned . She did not ask for help . Mrs. Bill 's claim that she never sought Francie 's help , was perfectly justified . Her method was to send news of trouble , as a joke , or to ask advice . This time she did both . " I 've got three people for the weekend and of course Mrs. : Jones has sprained her ankle . You can rely on Mrs. Jones 's ankle , it 's never failed her yet when there 's some real work to do . But meanwhile I have to find an experienced daily . Should I advertise ? I 'm so bad at these things . And I simply must get someone by this evening . " Catto , running in from the works in the mid-morning , to have a glimpse of his wife , finds her up and dressed . She is at the telephone , nursing the baby through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jean , with an expression of reserved disapproval which comically reproduces her father 's look in the same kind of crisis , stands looking on . Jean , a sensible Catto , is already devoted , in her sensible way , to her stepmother . She knows how to value her practical good nature , and quite agrees with her father about the Bill relations . " But Letty , " Francie 's voice implores her sister to be reasonable . " She simply must have four face towels . It may be ridiculous but you know there was trouble last time when she went with only two , and it upsets a child so much to be different . " Catto , furious , tries to take the out of Francie 's hands . Startled , crimson and fights him . " No  --  what are you doing ? " And he , equally surprised by this strong resistance , gives way . She says hastily to Letty , " It 's all right , darling . Nothing . I 'll be round in ten minutes , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I can do Letty on the way to Mother 's . How lucky that I was going anyhow . " " You 're not going to do Letty , or your mother either . This is where we stop . You 're not fit . " And seeing the obstinate look in her face , he begins to storm . her mother and Letty are two of the most selfish people on earth . And has she no consideration for her baby , not to speak of her husband ? Francie , flustered , tries to interrupt . Suddenly she bursts into tears . Catto , alarmed by her violent agitation , sits down beside her and puts an arm around her . " My darling , you see how it is . Someone has to make a stand . Let me do it for you if you 're afraid . " " But you ca n't , you ca n't . No one can . " " But that 's nonsense- " " You do n't understand . Lctty would simply let that poor child go off again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't get a daily in time for dinner this evening . There is n't a hope . She 'll leave everything to settle itself , and Mrs. Jones will limp about and get up a grievance till she gives notice . She loves a real grievance . And if Mother loses Mrs. Jones I 'd have to go every day . Either that or Mother would have to live with us . And you 'd hate that . Oh dear , there 's Gordon in the car . " And still nursing , while her brother-in-law , chattering about Letty 's headache , gathers her bag , she hurries out . n s ix months later Mrs. Bill did lose Mrs. Jones , and she has failed to keep another housekeeper . She is very cheerful and says that on the whole she prefers to manage without Mrs. Jones who had no humor . Francie has her second baby , and she lives a still more distracted life , dashing over three times a week to manage her mother 's house-hold . It has been proposed that Mrs. Bill should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up her dear old house , with its glorious memories of William Archer , E. F. Benson , and George Alexander . And as for the proposal that the Cattos should live with her , taking hail the house for their separate apartment , which is Mrs. Bill 's solution to the problem , Catto ca n't bring himself to leave his home . He points out that the kitchen was especially designed for Francie 's convenience . So that he too lives a distracted life . See him now at ten o'clock at night waiting at Hunter 's Green to take Francie home . It is raining but he is so angry that he wo n't leave the car to go into the house . This , of course , is stupid , for Mrs. Bill is always good-natured with him and says , " My dear Tom , I do n't ask Francie to run my show , it 's Francie who insists on it . She 's so practical  --  she hates a muddle . Now I do n't mind muddle a bit . " For Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that . And Catto thinks bitterly , " Practical and affectionate  --  how true that was  --  and is. " s UDDEN LY the house door opens and Francie comes running through the rain . He starts the engine , before he realizes that she has neither hat nor coat . She comes to the driver 's side , pulls open the door , and puts her arms round his neck . " Darling , only ten more minutes , I swear . " " But you 're getting wet . " " Yes , I saw the car from the window and I knew how you were feeling . Only ten more minutes . And then well be off . And I am so longing ? " She kisses him again and again , there is a cry from the house , " Francie , " and she runs . Catto falls back in his seat . He is excited , his heart is beating fast , there are tears in his eyes . For he adores his wife , it is an agony for him to see Francie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are worthless beside her .
