Even without a program , theatergoers would have had no trouble figuring out where they were . The scene was clearly the familiar slum section of Williamsburg , Tenn. , with its long rows of dusty souls and crumbling emotions tilting crazily against a dusky sky . But there had been changes . In Period of Adjustment , which opened last week at Miami 's Coconut Grove Playhouse , Playwright Tennessee Williams repaired no cracking masonry in his familiar dramatic neighborhood , but at least he slapped on a coat of whitewash . <P> Billed as a " Serious Comedy , " Period sounds more like a mad gothic anecdote . A couple of newly weds ( Robert Webber and Barbara Baxley ) drive up in a secondhand funeral limousine to the home of the groom 's wartime buddy ( James Daly ) . Left alone with the buddy , the bride ruefully sums up the first 36 hours of life with hubby : he shakes with an uncontrollable psychosomatic tremor , drinks incessantly " to keep warm , " on their wedding night leaped at her like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole night sitting up in a chair . <P> A mere nothing compared to the buddy 's own troubles . He , it seems , married a snaggle-toothed bag to secure his position in her father 's firm , but she left him , and , even worse , the old tightwad gave him only one raise in six years . Eventually their respective spouses return , and after a helpful exchange of advice , the couples retire to patch up their differences in classic fashion . " Honey , " pleads the patient buddy just before the final curtain , " please do n't put that Vicks Vapo Rub on your chest . " <P> Perhaps significantly , the grimly bizarre comedy is Williams ' first play to be produced since he abandoned his well-advertised long-term lease on the psychiatrist 's couch . Upbeat only in comparison to his other plays , Period nevertheless glows with several scenes of gentle , off-focus humor , as when the two men boozily dream of raising buffalo ( a " dignified beast " ) to rent out to producers of TV westerns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who may be the only ones to see it ; Williams is still undecided about taking it to Broadway ) , in its own way it was a revelation to the author . For the first time Playwright Williams decided to take a crack at directing his own work , gave up the reins midway through rehearsals when he concluded sadly : " I ca n't direct my way out of a paper bag .
