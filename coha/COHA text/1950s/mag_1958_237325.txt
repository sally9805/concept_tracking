THE BYSTANDER ( 205 pp. ) - Albert J. Guerard-Little , Brown ( $3.75 ) . <P> At some point of adolescence , every schoolboy falls distantly in love with an actress . Few do as complete a job as Anthony , the downbeat narrator of this new novel , who carries the torch for his actress over a stretch of 18 years and then , lamentably , achieves gratification . <P> Even as a schoolboy , Anthony is an odd one : an American with a background of wealth and parental indifference attending a Parisian lycee . At 15 , eating ice cream and plum cake in a tearoom near the Madeleine , Anthony finds the courage to speak worshipfully to Christiane Mondor , a 22-year-old , swan-necked beauty who is moving through her first season of heady triumphs on the stage . <P> They meet again nearly two decades later amid the summer languors of the Riviera . Life has been rough . The adult Anthony is now a " writer , artist , translator , hack ; gambler , sensualist , fool , " and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . " Cursed with a slim annuity adequate for subsistence but not for pleasure , he has slowly lowered himself into squalor " as by a rope . " Christiane 's failures have paced his own : two unsuccessful marriages ( one to a South American millionaire , the other to a German industrialist ) and a scandal of a perversity startling even to Paris . <P> Their affair seems to offer each of them a chance of recapturing the hopes of youth . Anthony accepts his own degradation but romantically believes that Christiane has been able to carry her innocence through the mire of the years . Yet nothing has changed . He is still the petulant adolescent and she the woman who can be had but not possessed . Soon Christiane floats away on the superficiality that has always sustained her ; Anthony sinks like a stone into the slums " to vanish up obscure alleys , to discover the filthiest restaurants and most squalid lodgings , to fuse with the dirty and the degraded . " <P> Author Guerard ( The Hunted , Maquisard ) , 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English at Harvard . He writes with a Gallic coolness and clarity , and with the sure French eye for the inhuman qualities of the human condition . This novel , his fifth , has both wit and wisdom , but his major characters are fated to sound like literary echoes : charming as Christiane is , she has been met before more charmingly in the pages of Colette ; Anthony , in his bedridden sloth , his antisocial despairs , his wounded intellectual cries , has slouched through a long line of novels ranging from Ivan Goncharov 's Oblomov to Louis-Ferdinand Celine 's Journey to the End of the Night .
