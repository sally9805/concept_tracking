When the rattle of base hits had subsided and the debating societies finally departed from the mound , the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Athletics dragged wearily off to Shibe Park 's dressing rooms . In the nine-inning game , nine pitchers had given up 21 walks , 34 hits had ripped across the field ; 36 runners had crossed the plate-a new American League record . <P> By last week such scoring sprees were beginning to look like the rule rather than the exception . The Red Sox had already set a modern high-scoring mark ( 29 runs against St. Louis ) . The Cleveland Indians tied another record by scoring 14 runs in one inning . From owners , players , managers and coaches came an old , familiar cry : someone had been putting benzedrine in the baseball again . <P> Atomic Secrets . Braves Manager Billy Southworth was certain of it . " I 'm afraid someone 's going to get killed , " he gloomed . Yankee Coach Bill Dickey was just as convinced : " It 's making a joke of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes the balls denied any skulduggery , one player insisted : " The atom bomb secrets were sold to Spalding , not the Russians . " <P> Those who blamed the rabbit ball for 1950 's batting splurge could produce plenty of statistics to support their stand . In one game the Yankees and Tigers had banged out a record eleven homers . Homerun production , in fact , was up 27% over last year . Boston 's Ted Williams had already hit 24 , Cleveland 's Al Rosen 25 , and the Pirates ' Ralph Kiner 20 . But although most pitchers were beginning to seem lucky if they lasted through the seventh-inning stretch , there was more than a suspicion that the ball alone was not responsible . <P> There were still a few stalwarts who seemed to have no complaints . Detroit 's Art Houtteman , Cleveland 's Bob Lemon , and the Braves ' Johnny Sain had already won ten games each . Rookie Bob Miller had won seven straight for the front-running Phillies . The Giants ' Larry Jansen had pitched 30 consecutive scoreless innings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the major leagues headed into the Fourth of July weekend , it was that kind of pitching , not the hitting , that made the difference . With only two reliable starters ( Preacher Roe and Don Newcombe ) , the favored Dodgers were wallowing along in a tight six-way race . In the American League , the Detroit Tigers had jumped into a commanding lead over the favored Red Sox , whose hitting could not match the Tigers ' pitching . <P> Wrapping up the major leagues at the midseason mark , and taking a hefty clout at the rabbit-ball fanciers , New York Herald Tribune Columnist Red Smith had a ready explanation for the 1950 rash of home runs and high-scoring ball games : " . . . The real fault is not the lively ball but the deadly pitching . "
