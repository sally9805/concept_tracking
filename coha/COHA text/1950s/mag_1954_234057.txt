Like any other official in a similar position , Chicago 's Assistant School Superintendent Thaddeus Lubera was dismayed . <P> He urgently needed 300 more high-school teachers , but when he announced that a special examination would take place , only 100 applicants showed up to take it . What could Chicago do about its ever-increasing shortage of teachers ? <P> Last week Chicago schoolmen were working out a plan by which 13 Illinois colleges and universities will offer teacher-training courses at the undergraduate level and thus assure a whole new batch of teachers . But more important than the plan itself was the fact that Chicago had become the latest recruit to what is virtually a nationwide campaign . <P> The campaign starts from two motives : some programs are designed merely to attract more teachers , and some are a part of a growing revolt against standard U.S. teacher training . But whatever the motivations , the programs have one major target : to tap for the teaching profession the vast reservoir of ordinary liberal arts graduates. * Last week , along with Chicago , Northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master of arts in teaching program which will combine advanced graduate work with the courses necessary to meet Illinois teacher requirements . Among other programs now flourishing across the U.S. : <P> Sparked by the Ford Foundation , Arkansas started a " bold new experiment " in teacher training two years ago , now has 15 colleges in the state participating . The idea is to persuade students to go into teaching by giving them four years of the liberal arts plus a fifth year of professional internship at either the State Teachers ' College at Conway or the University of Arkansas . In 1953-54 , the plan got 30 recruits . Total applicants for next fall : 88 . <P> Connecticut began its program in 1949 , now offers emergency certificates to liberal arts graduates who complete a special eight-week summer course at any one of four state teachers ' colleges . Students are supposed to observe qualified teachers , learn the essentials of tests and measurements , child psychology and teaching methods . After that , they begin teaching , but for the first year are closely guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed so far : 1,410 . <P> Through a special arrangement with Harvard , 29 Eastern colleges now actively try to persuade their students to go into teaching : they hold conferences , mail out pamphlets , put up posters . Students who join up go for a fifth year to the Harvard Graduate School of Education , not only take professional courses but do some actual teaching at nearby schools . At the end of the year , they get either a master of education degree or a master of arts in teaching . Two years ago , 40 students went to Harvard from the participating colleges . This year 's registration : 100 . <P> Wesleyan University ( Conn. ) also has a master of arts in teaching program . Each year twelve liberal arts graduates are chosen for $1,600 university fellowships , for the next two years combine , advanced work in their chosen fields with the study and practice of teaching .
