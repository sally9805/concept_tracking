Like thousands of other German youngsters , Hilde Speer , a button-bright 16-year-old student at Heidelberg 's Elisabeth von Thadden School , would like nothing better than a chance to go to an American school . She saw her chance last spring in a notice in the local paper : a number of German youngsters were going to be sent to the U.S. as exchange students . Hilde wrote a letter stating her reason for wanting to go : " I want to become acquainted with the people of the U.S. , the poor as well as the rich , the land , the big cities , and the many problems of America . " Last week , after two interviews , a U.S. cultural officer in Germany wrote Hilde the good news : she had been chosen as one of 27 students from her area to be given an all-expense-paid trip to the U.S. Breathlessly , Hilde began to prepare for the big adventure . <P> Then State Department officials in Washington made an embarrassing discovery : Hilde 's father is Albert Speer , an architect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1942 ; he is now serving 20 years as a convicted war criminal . Last week the department took Hilde 's name off the list . Officials explained that they were not prejudiced against the girl on account of her father 's past , but merely wanted to save her from painful embarrassment . It cited recent instances where social invitations to German exchange students in the Midwest were cancelled after newspapers carried unfavorable stories about them . Said a U.S. State Department man in Germany : " Can you imagine what would happen when those nasty New York reporters hollered , ' Hilde , how does it feel to have your old man a war criminal ? ' " <P> Hilde got the news that she had been turned down , not from the State Department , but from reporters . She said that she was " very surprised and a little mixed up , " and wondered how she would tell her classmates . <P> Her classmates and everyone else in Germany know a word nastier than a possible question by a New York reporter . The word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family liability . " It was widely used in Hitler 's day when men , women &; children were punished because they had anti-Nazi relatives . <P> The U.S. State Department does not believe in Sippenhaft , but its position in the case of Hilde Speer will convince a lot of Germans that it does .
