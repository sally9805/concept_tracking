As the can begins to spin , the centrifugal force moves him to the outer walls . Faster and faster it goes . Soon the boy can move neither backward nor forward ; he is the prisoner of the machine . Searching for freedom , he scrambles along the walls upside down . The machine , he discovers , has repealed the natural law that keeps his feet on the ground . It has robbed him of all relationship to the true center of things . <P> The child in the centrifuge stands for modern man in the society he has made .
