MAN 'S COURAGE A Story by Wyatt Blassingame Drawings by George Gillespie T HE FACT that Lieutenant Henderson was a Negro did not alone cause the trouble . At least part of it went deeper , springing from one of those curious , instantaneous , apparently chemical dislikes that two men sometimes feel and for which there is no logical reason , the men simply recoiling from one another like reversed magnets . But certainly it would be wrong to say that Henderson 's color , and the fact that Lee Stewart , the private , was from Mississippi , did not affect the matter . At least it dramatized it , gave it a foundation in the obvious that we could all see and understand , just as we could sense without understanding the other deeper feeling between them . And surely Stewart himself did not understand , could not until it was all over , that the problem went beyond color , that there existed a deeply personal relationship , even if founded on sudden and instinctive dislike , between him and a Negro . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a coward and a misfit in our regiment were predicated on the simple fact of color ; his hatred was based on this even after the more personal reasons  --  the repeated KP , being stopped on the sidewalk and forced to salute , the matter of the car and the liquor  --  were obvious to all of us . It was so obvious that ' hen word went around Lee Stewart was going to kill Henderson , none ofus doubted it , It was just a matter of time and method . And soon we ( the enlisted men ; Henderson was probably the only officer to know what was happening before it was all over ) knew that too . " Because only a fool would get himself in trouble over a nigger , " Stewart said . This was at Mac 's bar . There was a group around him as always , paratroopers wearing their half boots and managing to look both rakish and competent in that way no other outfit can simulate , not even the Marines . It was one of these , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I 'm no fool , " Stewart added . Belle , the girl who tended bar , said , " You 're sure about to get yourself in trouble . " " Not me , Sugar . " He reached across the bar to pat her arm . " We 're going on maneuvers next week . You think you can get along without me for a while ? " SO WE knew then it would be during maneuvers in the Florida swamps : a fouled parachute , a rifle that went off by accident . There were always opportunities for that sort of thing . There were even rumors that it had happened in our regiment before . We were a tough outfit that took pride in its toughness , no man more than Lee Stewart . There were n't many left who had been with the regiment when it was the first to jump over Normandy , but they were enough to carry on the legend and the pride . And there were more who had helped stop that first , now almost-forgotten , break-through in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could see the Yalu as we came down and then had to walk back , looking , we thought , like Washington 's army the winter at Valley Forge while we did it . There had always been considerable fraternization between officers and men , as there is in most fighting outfits , and our respect for officers was not so much in the bar or leaf on the collar as in the man . Weak officers , as well as weak men , had been weeded out . And most of ifs , not only those who instinctively resented Henderson because of his color , believed he was a weak officer . He was West Point , only too much so . He had one of these quiet , restrained , sensitive faces you see sometimes on members of his race , but over it was a kind of mask as though he had put it on with his academy uniform , or even before that , when he got the appointment : the long and constant awareness of being a responsibility to his race , an officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he reached camp : a Negro officer , the first Negro officer most of us had served under . Then we saw him , small , precise , his cap as squarely on his head as it it had been placed there with the aid of engineering instruments . " My God , " one soldier said . " Do you think that when lie jumps he comes all the way down at attention ? " " Why not ? " Lee Stewart said . " He 's probably too scared to bend . " I T WAS a week later they had their first personal contact . Stewart was working on a jeep outside one of the hangars . Inside someone was tuning up the engine of a C54 and the sound of it filled the eardrums like wax . Stewart , his head and shoulders under the jeep 's hood , did not see Henderson , did not know he was present until the dark hand , the salmon-colored palm came over his shoulder and took the wrench from his own hand . Then , their heads close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , Soldier , " and working carefully he got loose the plug at which Stewart had been yanking . He stepped back and put the wrench on the fender , and as the two men stood looking at one another it slid off and fell to the ground between them . Neither moved . Perhaps Stewart ( who as a child had never known or even seen a Negro who was not some white man 's servant ) had for an instant forgotten the bar on the other 's collar . Anyway  --  and to all of us working on the hangar apron this was perfectly apparent  --  he expected the Negro to stoop and pick up the wrench . On the lieutenant 's face there was no expression at all . They just stood there , looking at one another with the wrench on the ground between them . After a moment Henderson took a clean handkerchief from his pocket , wiped his hands , and turned away . At the same instant , inside the hangar , the C54 's engine was silent . In the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be goddamned . . . " speaking not so much in anger as baffled amazement . Henderson stopped . He looked back at Stewart , the handkerchief still in his hands , his face withdrawn , expressionless . " What is it , Soldier ? " Stewart merely stared at him . Henderson put the handkerchief in his pocket , turned , and walked away . It was that same afternoon Stewart drew KP . He blamed it loudly , openly , on Henderson , damning not the man so much as the incredible stupidity of some unknown " they " who would assign a Negro , and therefore a coward , a misfit , to a paratroop outfit that considered itself , even in peacetime , a strictly combat unit . " To us , " Stewart said , his voice dazed , aghast . " Of all the outfits in the army they assign a nigger officer to us . " Then he drew KP again . He began to get work details far more often than they would have come to him in the normal cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware of Stewart not only as the leader of that group which will always instantly and violently resent a Negro officer , but as an individual . Perhaps it was the white officers that reported to him , perhaps it was some of the scattering of Negro enlisted men in the regiment , but soon it was apparent he knew of Stewart and was retaliating , deliberately , precisely , riding hard the uncross-able advantage of rank . HE BEGAN to ask for Stewart as a driver and we would see them on the camp streets , even on the highway into town : the white man , the servant , on the front seat , the officer behind him , neither speaking until Henderson would say , not even leaning forward , " Turn right at the next corner . Stop here . " He said it this time in front of Mac 's Bar and Stewart stopped the car . He sat there , holding the wheel , beginning to breathe a little hard now , knowing that Belle was inside and probably looking out through the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over the back of the seat , appearing at Stewart 's right shoulder with a five-dollar bill between his index and third finger . " Would you go inside and get me a bottle of bourbon ? " Stewart looked at him then , as much with unbelief as with anger . " What ? What is it you want ? " " A bottle of bourbon , " Henderson said . And then , " When we get back to the post I wo n't have a chance to go by the Officer 's Club . And this is north Florida . They wo n't want me coming in the bar . Or is there a back entrance a Negro can use ? " " No , " Stewart said . He took the money and got out of the car . He went slowly , his head bent forward a little in thought , through the hot gold sunlight of late afternoon and into the dimness of the bar . Belle was already moving to meet him . He named a brand of whiskey , " A bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You drinking with him now , Lee ? " This was when he told her he was going to kill Lieutenant Henderson , saying it softly asthough he had thought about it a long time and now it was as good as done . Then he went outside and gave the lieutenant the bottle and drove him hack to the post . T HE NIGHT before maneuvers the regiment had orders to be back on the post at midnight . Some of us made quite a party of it at Mac 's Bar . Then it was quarter of twelve and we were crowding through the door , leaving , when we looked back and saw Stewart sitting at the far end of the bar . " Lee , you resigned from the Army ? " a soldier said . " You do n't think I 'm leaving without telling Belle good-by ? " Stewart said . So that was the last we saw of him , for a while anyway : a big man with a broad , hard face and red hair sitting there at the far end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blush or look indignant . We moved out the next morning and he did not go with us . But he was in camp when we returned and it was then he told us what had happened , telling it with the same baffled , awed amazement with which he had always regarded the idea of a Negro officer in our outfit . Only now there was something new in his voice : not just the knowledge that here was something he did not understand but , and for the first time , an attempt , a straining to understand . He had left Belle 's shortly after two . From there it was a half-mile walk to the camp , where he must climb a fence and reach his barracks without being seen , a thing he had done often enough before . But now as he stepped into the road a man said , " Stewart . " It was Lieutenant Henderson . This was a hack road with no traffic . On both sides the pines closed in , solid and dark , with a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim , almost nonexistent light Henderson 's face was featureless ; but Stewart could see the uniform , the square-set cap , the gun the lieutenant wore . " Yes ? " Stewart said . " I 'm glad I met you , " Henderson said . He spoke as always in a brisk , precise manner with no accent of any kind . " I do n't have a car . I have to walk back to the post . " Stewart said nothing . He was thinking hard , trying to figure the angle but with nothing to work on yet . Then Henderson said , " I understand there is talk around the regiment that someone is going to kill me . " And still Stewart did not answer , just leaning a little forward now , beginning to breathe more quickly , until Henderson 's hand moved , not hurriedly but quick , and even as Stewart started to leap he saw the gun was held out toward him , butt first . " So I 'm going to need a bodyguard , " Henderson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Henderson said . And when Stewart did not move , " It 's loaded . Take it . " Later Stewart said , " I thought it was going to be some kind of a duel . " So he took the gun and when it was in his hand Henderson said , " I do n't want anyone to shoot me in the back , so you will follow me at three paces . " Then in the same clipped voice , he said , " You can consider that an order , " and turned and started along the empty , moon-touched road . " Wait ! " Stewart said . But the officer did not stop , did not look back . And Stewart said again , " Wait ? " Then he began to curse , running until he caught Henderson by the arm and swung him around , still cursing . And Henderson said , " I ordered you to stay three steps back of me , " and went on again . " So I followed him , " Stewart said later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , or start to run , or whatever he was going to do . " No traffic passed them . On the left the pines stopped and there was open prairie , dark under the moon , on the right the wall of pines . Then the pines closed in again . The road curved through them as through a tunnel . There was no sound except that of their shoes on the road and somewhere , sourceless , and persistent , the call of a whippoorwill . THEN they were around the curve and there was a light ahead . This was the junction with the main highway ; the light was at the camp-gate . The lieutenant went on until he was within a hundred yards of the gate and the MPs who stood there were visible under the light . Then Henderson stopped and turned . " All right , " he said . " You had your chance . Why did n't you shoot me ? " " I could n't , " Stewart said . He was to repeat it later , sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the fingers locked and twisting . " I could n't shoot a  --  a man  --  not any man  --  in the back . Not with his own gun when he gave me the gun and turned his back on me . " And then , to Henderson , crying it almost , " You knew that ! You knew it ! " " No , " Henderson said . " I hoped . But the girl would have said anything you wanted . And a nigger 's body  --  a white jury . . . " " Then why ? ? " And answering himself , saying , " So that 's it . So you had to prove to me you were n't yellow even if you are a nigger . " " To the regiment , " Henderson said . " Do n't you even believe , ca n't you believe , that I am proud of it too ? " And when Stewart did not answer , " I tried every other way to stop you talking . And it had to be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart said . " All right , " Henderson said . He took the gun now . He said , " You were due back on the post by midnight . You will report to the MPs for being past hours . " " Yes , Sir , " Stewart said . And later , in the barracks , telling it slowly in an effort not only to make us understand but to understand himself , " Because he really did n't know I was n't going to shoot him , could n't shoot him that way . I reckon a nigger would n't know . " And then , with a kind of defiance in his face , " So I thought he had the Sir coming to him . "
