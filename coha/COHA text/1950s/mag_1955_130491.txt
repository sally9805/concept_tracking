It is only right to give the devil his due , and while that may be too strong a term even for Dodger fans , it is wrong to wait any longer to allow them their proper and deserved gloat . The Giants are through . // The truth is , they 've been through for well over a month now , but you know how Giant fans are . You remember 1951 and 1954 . They were glorious years for the Giants , years that filled their followers forever with wild and unreasonable optimism , even in times of suffering . // To the Giant fan there has never been a better ball team than the Giants who won the World Series last fall , and not just because of Dusty Rhodes and Willie Mays . What comes to mind is the driving , relentless game played by Henry Thompson at third base , the brilliance with which Alvin Dark ran bases , the calm , almost arrogant way Johnny Antonelli pitched . // The Giants were a wonderful team last fall , sharp and decisive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . There was a day in March in Phoenix , before the exhibition season began , when Leo Durocher got his infield  --  Thompson , Dark , Williams , Lockman  --  out for a fielding drill . It was a routine drill with the players betting cokes on the errors but , as so often happens with Leo Durocher , things suddenly caught fire . // Six or seven hundred people were watching from the grandstand . It might be that Leo felt the desire to show off before a crowd . Perhaps it was simple pride . At any rate when the time came to bring the ball in  --  the windup of the drill when each infielder in turn takes five grounders in succession , moving in closer to the plate for each one , throwing the ball each time in to the catcher and running off the field as he finishes  --  Durocher lit the spark . // " All right , " he barked in a voice that carried into the stands . " Let 's bring it in . And any miss this time means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . // " Okay , " he said , " but if we go all the way around without a miss the cokes are on you . " // " All right , " Durocher said , as only Durocher can say " all right "  --  in a tone that means , " You want to play rough ? All right , we 'll play rough . " // He began with Thompson at third base , and Thompson handled five in a row perfectly . Durocher was hitting the ball hard , to be fair to himself , but cleanly , to be fair to his infield . He hit five to Dark , and Dark handled five in a row , moving in defiantly on each ball until he was almost to the pitcher 's mound . Durocher turned to hit to Williams and found the second baseman waiting on the grass next to the pitcher 's mound , half crouched , hands flat down on his thighs , a little boy 's grin on his face because of the joke of being too close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands down twice on his thighs impatiently , as if to say , " Let 's go ! " " Move back ! " Durocher ordered . Williams , still grinning , not moving , smacked his hands down again . // " All right , " Durocher said . " All right . " // Five times he rocketed ground balls at Williams . Five times Williams came up with the ball brilliantly . When he ran in off the field Durocher turned to watch him go , grinning after him . Then he turned to Lockman and Lockman handled his five grounders without error , racing in for the last one , scooping it up , firing it to the catcher and sprinting in off the field . // The people in the grandstand burst into spontaneous applause , and Leo Durocher walked off the field , as proud as a man can be . // Watching the drill , feeling the excitement mount , sensing the competitive sharpness , the rise to a challenge , the triumph of accomplishment , the joy , the fun , the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute that the Giants were still the best team in baseball . // NOTHING LEFT BUT OPTIMISM // On such moments is optimism built . But later , after the season began and the hitters slumped and the fielders creaked with pulled muscles and bad backs and the pitchers lost their control and the team stumbled along , the moments were few for the Giant fan and optimism was about all he had left to nourish his spirit . // Oh , how he suffered these last several weeks as the Dodgers flew high and the Giants plummeted like wounded eagles  --  four straight losses and 12 of 17 in the first great collapse and then six straight and 12 of 15 in the second . // But even so , optimism prevailed , and when the Giants revived in early July to win four games in a row and six of seven , the ears of every Giant fan in the country stood erect , quivering , listening for something , anything , that sounded like ' 51 or ' 54 . The Dodgers were coming into the Polo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league by 13 ? games and were 16 ? ahead of the fourth-place Giants , the Giant fan waited for them as the starving wolf waits for the frolicking lamb . This might be the time , he felt . This might be the beginning . // For instance , Arch Murray of the New York Post , a good writer and a good reporter but a Giant fan to the core , wrote seriously : " If the Giants can win two out of three , they 'll be only 15 ? away with almost half a season to go . " And someone told Leo Durocher that the Giants would be only 13 ? behind if they swept all three games . You know what he meant . You remember in 1951 when the Giants were 13 ? games behind the Dodgers and ... Well , so Leo , who has had a hard time this year , remembered it too . " We 'd be right back in their territory again , would n't we ? " he said , grinning . // All this is mentioned only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . Even though the team was at a bare .500 , with 40 won and 40 lost , and closer to sixth place than third , Giant players and Giant fans were thinking of a pennant . // They forgot about it that night . In a game with the Dodgers that they knew they had to win , the Giants lost . More than that they lost to a patchwork Dodger team , playing without Campanella , Furillo or Robinson . They lost after running up an impressive 6-0 lead against the renowned Don Newcombe , whose record of 14-1 is the best in the majors . They lost miserably , giving up the winning runs in the eighth and ninth innings on some of the worst fielding seen this season . // The final score was 12-8 , and nothing the Giants do the rest of the year  --  even flashes like their 10-2 and 3-2 victories in the remainder of the series  --  will make up for it . The Giants are not only dead , they are buried . Their season is over , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
