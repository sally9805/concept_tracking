All down the backstretch of the 1950 baseball season , the World Champion New York Yankees had been chasing the pace-setting Detroit Tigers . As late as mid-August the Yankees were in third place , 4 games behind . Last week , as the American League pennant race entered the September homestretch , the Yankees spurted into the lead . <P> With four weeks to go , the four-first-division clubs were still closely bunched ; only five games separated the field this week . But Detroit fans , whose team had lost eight of its last 15 games , had to admit that their entry was beginning to look a little winded . Cleveland , smarting under four straight defeats by the Yankees , was falling behind the pace , too . The two hottest teams in the league were the hard-hitting ( team batting average : .307 ) Boston Red Sox , in 3rd place after winning twelve of their last fourteen games , and the Yankees . <P> Tired Reliables . That the Yankees were even within talking reach of the 1950 pennant was the wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henrich ( .287 last year ) out of the regular line-up most of the season . Joe DiMaggio ( hitting .285 ) was winning games when they counted , but he had been off form all through midseason . Relief Pitcher Joe Page ( 3 won , 5 lost ) was far behind his 1949 performance . <P> What had kept the aged , ailing Yankees in the race ? Big , barrel-shaped Veteran Johnny Mize , 37 , was one answer . Called up from Kansas City in the spring , he had hit 19 home runs in 68 games . Three other standbys were Sophomore Outfielder Hank Bauer ( .341 ) , Shortstop Phil Rizzuto ( .330 ) and Catcher Yogi Berra ( .323 ) . They were having the best seasons of their baseball careers . <P> Seven Saved . In the pitching department , Manager Casey Stengel had been getting smooth , workmanlike performances from his big four : Ed Lopat , Allie Reynolds , Vic Raschi and Tommy Byrne . Unlike other managers of pennant contenders , Stengel had not been forced to use his starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hole for relief work was Tom Ferrick , bought from the St. Louis Browns in June . Righthander Ferrick , 35 and no great shakes with a second-division club , has become the Yankees ' 1950 Joe Page . In 18 appearances on the mound for them he has won seven games , saved seven others since the Fourth of July . <P> With that kind of pitching , and with solid hitting from Bauer , Berra and Rizzuto , Manager Stengel can afford to rest his old reliables occasionally , save them for the games where they will be needed most . If baseball history repeats , two such games will be the last two of the season . Last year , as no New York or Boston fan needs to be told , the Yankees won the pennant by taking the last two from the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium . This year the teams end their seasons with a two-game series in Fenway Park .
