Too Much , Too Soon ( Warner ) , a sort of woman-on-the-rocks chaser to I 'll Cry Tomorrow , may make a lot of moviegoers feel that they have had one too many . The film is based on the best-selling autobiography ( TIME , April 15 , 1957 ) in which Actress Diana Barrymore ( skillfully assisted by Author Gerold Frank ) told in embarrassing detail about her troubles with booze and men . In the movie the booze flows a good deal more freely than the narrative , which reels along like a drunken monologue with a familiar moral : weak people should avoid strong drink . <P> " The marriage of the century " between Actor-Painter John Barrymore and Socialite-Poetaster Blanche Oelrichs ( who wrote and kept a salon as Michael Strange ) was fondly expected to produce a great work of art , but all that ever came of it was Diana , " a fat little girl with straight black hair cut in stringy bangs . " When Diana was four , Mother loosed her wedlock on Father , who went west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so the picture suggests . At any rate , when Diana was 20 , she made her Broadway debut to impressive reviews , and went west to make movies and whoopee . <P> At 21 , according to the film , Diana ( Dorothy Malone ) married a Broadway actor who came home from work one day to find her drunk and in bed with the man who later became Husband No. 2 , a " tennis bum " who refused to work for fear he might " use the wrong muscles , " and who took sadistic pleasure in driving tennis balls at Diana 's face . Husband No. 3 was almost as big a lush as Diana , and together they rapidly drank up all the money she had made and inherited . According to the script , she wound up doing take-offs ( including clothes ) in a Manhattan dive , and one night she ran amuck and wound up in the alcoholic ward . That 's where the " unholy ghost " ( as Author Frank is known on Publisher 's Row ) caught up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In the book Author Frank proved himself a competent amateur head-shrinker . But in the movie the psychologizing is vulgarly done , and every possible appeal is made to the sort of customer who likes to rub his nose in other people 's business . Those who do not can only sadly agree with Diana , who at one point remarks that there is no sense in telling her story . " Living it was bad enough . " <P> Gigi ( M-G-M ) , 14 years and three versions ago , was a dainty Colette novelette . Once a French movie , once a Broadway play , the spicy little tidbit is now a full-course feast for eyes and ears , an extravagant $3,000,000 cinemusical with four bright stars ( Leslie Caron , Maurice Chevalier , Louis Jourdan , Eva Gabor ) , a strong supporting cast , a topnotch director ( Vincente Minnelli ) . words and music by My Fair Lady 's Lerner and Loewe , * and some flooringly flamboyant sets and costumes by Cecil Beaton . <P> When Director Minnelli showed them his rough cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something special , and announced that the show would open like a Broadway play-white tie and hard ticket . The public seemed to like the idea . Despite advanced prices ( $3 top ) , more than $40,000 worth of tickets were mail-ordered before the box office opened .
