The doctor sat behind a desk at the apex of the L-shaped room ; the ministers and their wives sat at ease before him . At the doctor 's right was a blackboard , and on his desk stood a microphone wired to a tape recorder which ran steadily throughout the four-hour session . " It has been said that the line between love and hate is razor-thin , " said the doctor . " It 's thinner than that . It 's not there at all . Hate is simply a counter-attitude to love . " Nobody demurred at that , and the ministers and their wives went on to talk of other things-not shoes and ships and sealing wax , but exhibitionism and impotence , sexual deviation and married love . <P> Masochist , or Son of God ? This relaxed gathering in Omaha last week was the latest meeting of a group of 38 men and women , mostly Methodist ministers and their wives who have been getting together about once a month for the past two years . They began when a church-going Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrists were trying to do much the same job , the psychiatrists were doing it better . He persuaded his medical-school classmate , Dr. G. Alexander ( " Bob " ) Young Jr. , who became a psychosomaticist after the war , to take on a group of ministers for lectures , discussions and group therapy . Then he persuaded the Rev. Ben Wallace of Omaha 's Hanscom Park Methodist Church to help round up a group . <P> They called the result the Ministers ' Clinic of Nebraska . Members paid $10 a couple per meeting , and some of them drove as much as 300 miles to get there . Drs . Young and Tompkins served without pay . And doctors and clerical couples decided that the experiment was a dramatic success . <P> Once they got over their natural skittishness of the facts of unconscious life , informal , easygoing Bob Young found it surprisingly easy to get his clerical couples talking about their aggressions , repressions and sexual problems . Even a little theology was kicked around-with some of the inanity that is often a byproduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of whether Jesus Christ was a masochist . ( Yes , said Bob Young : he denied himself marriage and made his life one long bid for suffering . No , said the ministers : men crucified him because they were not yet ready for the Son of God and his principle of love . ) <P> Mad All the Time . But for Bob Young 's ministers and their wives the psychiatric sessions have opened new vistas . " For 2 years , " says the . Rev. James L. Ray , 29 , of the First Methodist Church in Auburn , Neb. ( pop . 3,422 ) , " I worked with a church youth group , in Lincoln , and I never had one young person come in for personal counsel . Then one night I talked about what I 've been learning these last two years-dynamic psychiatry . The next week seven young people came in for personal talks , and they 've been coming ever since . . . " To the Rev. Walter L. Jewett of Centenary Methodist Church in Beatrice , Neb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant a reorientation of my entire life . Why , I used to be mad all the time-and I never realized it ... I 'd been preaching for 25 years , and I had no adequate idea of how to tackle the job I had to do . "
