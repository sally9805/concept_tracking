Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> At his home near Havana , Nobel Prize-winning Novelist Ernest Hemingway <P> packed his fishing tackle and got set to fly to Peru , where he will try to catch a star for the movie version of his novelette , The Old Man and the Sea . Hemingway 's quarry : a Pacific black marlin weighing at least 1,500 Ibs. ( world-record catch and heftiest fish ever taken by rod and reel : 1,560 Ibs . ) . <P> <P> The University of Miami 's Irwin Luck , 18 , tyro tunesmith , proved his sophomore flair for big-time promotion . Weary of begging Crooner Perry Como to plug a passel of Lucky lyrics , Floridian Luck anted up $500 of his own savings plus $350 from his real-estate man papa , bought a month 's space on a huge ( 20 ft. - by- 60 ft. ) billboard near Times Square to make his plea public . Excerpt from Luck 's open letter to Como : " I pray that you will give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my numbers . " Easygoing Crooner Como gee-whizzed , promised to give Composer Luck 's songs a hearing , maybe a warbling . <P> <P> Tireless Anthologist-Poet Louis Untermeyer , 70 , paused in Denver long <P> enough to predict that the U.S. will burgeon in the next half-century as the <P> world 's great cultural mecca . Said he : <P> " We 're ready for our renaissance , our <P> great Golden Age . . . Westward the course of culture ! " <P> <P> The U.S. liner Constitution hove to off the port of Monaco one morning last week and set Hollywood 's Grace Kelly aboard Deo Juvante II , the virginal white 138-ft. yacht of Grace 's groom-to-be , Prince Rainier III . All Monaco broke loose . Rockets zoomed , sirens screamed , dockside trolleys klaxoned , cannon fired 21-gun salutes . Ashore , the crowd-Mone-gasques , outlanders and the cream of world jewel thievery-dutifully roared . Overhead , a seaplane belonging to Sea Lord Aristotle Socrates Onassis , controlling croupier of Monte Carlo 's famed Casino , bombarded Grace and His Serene Highness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers closed for a buss , were thwarted by a fast block thrown by Grace 's arm-held poodle Oliver , settled on an awkward , unromantic handshake . <P> <P> On his first public outing with Grace , the Prince rolled forth in his green Chrysler Imperial , was roadblocked by some 50 photographers , angrily retaliated by barring the lensmen from his palace and Wednesday 's civil wedding ( the religious ceremony is two days later ) . Wedding gifts kept pouring in , karat upon karat . From the principality itself and the Casino came , according to Newshen Inez Robb , " some basic or all-purpose diamonds " : a $224,000 set of gem-crusted earrings , bracelet , necklace , ring and clips.
