txt The Truman Administration has received Ambassador at Large John Foster Dulles ' report on his mission to Japan with extraordinary satisfaction and has authorized him to proceed with the completion of the Japanese peace treaty at the earliest possible date . Mr. Dulles , who returned here yesterday from a trip to Japan , Australia , New Zealand and the Philippines , is understood to have made the following points in his report to the State Department today : 1 . The Japanese Government agreed in detail to his suggestion that the United States retain broad military and naval rights within and around Japan after the signing of a peace treaty with the United States and other peaceloving states . 2 . These military rights were accepted voluntarily by the Japanese Government . Mr. Dulles emphasized in Tokyo that the United states was not making any demands upon Japan and was not ooligating itself at this time to defend the political independence or territorial integrity of the Japanese islands . 3 . The question of specific guarantees could not arise until Japan was economically and politically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy or self-help and mutual aid . This fact was recognized by the Japanese Government . Moreover , the question of the future of the Ryukyu Islands , which Japan wants , was left for later discussion . 4 . General of the Army Douglas agreed upon the necessity of proceeding quickly to the negotiation of a peace treaty . He also agreed to work out and forward to Washington as soon as possible a list of items that Japan could manufacture to help at once in the rearmament programs of the Western nations . It was important to use Japanese manpower and manufacturing facilities in the production of such things as gun sights , binoculars and parachutes , // Mr. Dulles said , so that Japan 's economy  --  on which her military contribution depended  --  could revive as soon as possible . 5 . It was essential too that no restrictions be written into the Japanese peace treaty on Japan 's shipbuilding and textile production . Without freedom of action in these fields , Japan would remain an economic burden upon the United States or might even seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . The defense of Southeast Asia , a natural trading area for Japan , must be made as secure as possible . 7 . At the same time , in working out these economic and military problems in Japan , the natural worries of Australia , New Zealand and the Philippines about the revival of an aggressive spirit in Japan must be recognized and dealt with as effectively as other United States security and economic commitments permitted . Preliminary Report Expected It originally was expected that Mr. Dulles would have merely an indecisive preliminary report to make to the State Department as a result of his five-week trip to the Pacific , but so much was accomplished , partciularly in Japan , that the main task of negotiation now lies , not with the Japanese Government , but with Britain , Australia , New Zealand and the Philippines . The Board of Trade in London is apparently worried about the possibility of competition from unrestricted Japanese shipbuilding and textile industries . Consequently , there have been some suggestions from British officials that restrictions upon these two industries should be written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealanders and Filipinos , likewise , have certain military and economic reservations they would like to have satisfied before agreeing to the United States conception of a Japanese peace treaty . The Manila Government , for example , has a claim of $8,000,000 , - 000 in war reparations against Japan . It would like some assurances about this . The best Mr. Dulles was able to do on this when he was in Manila , however , was to suggest that if the Philippine Government could figure out any way in which this claim could he satisfied without hampering the Japanese economy or transferring the reparation problem to the United States , he would be glad to see that any such scheme got a " sympathetic study " in Washington . Mr. Dulles was represented by his associates in the State nepartment as reporting that the Aus-11 tralians were worried about the revival of Japanese militarization .. This worry , he is said to have indicated , was highlighted by what seemed to be the beginning of an election campaign in Australia . The Australian and New Zealandl Governments apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it might be wise , he suggested , for the United States to try to spell out more clearly its interest in the security of Australia , New Zealand and the Philippines in order to demonstrate to the peoples of those countries that there was no conflict between their security and the United States proposals for a Japanese treaty . There now is apparently little likelihood of a general peace conference for Japan . This would at once bring up the question of who was to represent China at such a conference , the Chinese Nationalists , who are recognized by the United States , or the Chinese Communists , who are recognized as the legal government of China by Britain . It is expected , therefore , that the instrument of peace will be negotiated through diplomatic channels , with each Government signing it separately . The question of who signs for China may be left to the Japanese Government to determine at a later date . to Hold Talks All other questions of the United States military rights in Japan , however , and of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the near future , General will discuss with the Japanese authorities where and under what circumstances the American forces in Japan will be stationed , it being fully understood , that in case of urgent ' defense requirements , these troops will not be limited to certain areas , but may move as necessary to meet any contingency . Mr. Dulles pointed out to the Japanese in this connection that it was for the Japanese themselves to decide whether they wished these troops to remain on their territory , just as it was for the British Government to determine whether , in the common plan of defense , it wanted United States air bases on its island . Mr. Dulles will see the British Ambassador here later this week , and later may go to Britain to discuss the shipbuilding and textile problems . He also indicated today a desire to discuss the whole question of the treaty with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States , Jacob A. Malik . This will probably be arranged within the next few days . DULLES NOW SEEKS BACKING FOR PACT // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
