txt This will be known as the day the rebel 26th of July Movement took Havana . Streets and official buildings have been swarming with their men , and for the first time there are thousands of pistols , revolvers , rifles and tommy guns in the hands of youths ? and many of them are being fired . Yesterday unarmed looters went about , but today Havana was an armed camp . Ironically , the main garrison of the capital , Camp Columbia , , was quiet . At each gate stood a tank , with soldiers armed with tommy guns sitting astride the tanks . Inside was one of the most peaceful spots in all Cuba . It remained a peaceful but busy place after the camp was taken over by Col. Ramon Barquin , now chief of staff here for Fidel Castro 's revolutionary command , and the troopers on guard were Castro men . Civilians still stood around the gates . Police Headquarters Open Yesterday the headquarters for the police patrol cars that opponents of the Batista regime had learned so well to dreadI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful . Policemen fraternized with youths , and all the patrol cars were out ' in the streets . One sees them now with a ( policeman driving , a youngman armed with whatever he can lay hands on sitting by his side , and other 26th of July youths in the back . Once , as this correspondent was driving around the city , a jeep loaded with six soldiersi and several civilians came along . The soldiers had tied black-andred bands of the 26th of July Movement to their rifles and were waving them happily ' at the cheering passers-by . This , too , was a symbol of the change , that has taken place in the last twenty-four hours . However , a deadly ugliness is not far below the= surface . It showed- itself vividly today when hundreds of armed-youths with 26th of July liands. johlie4 by other - hundreds of elviliens , // attacked the headquarters of Senator Rolando Masferrer in the Central Park , which is the Havana equivalent of Times Square : Senor Masferrer had had a little private army working for General Batista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an occasional hand grenade kept the center of the city on edge for nearly two hours late this morning . Cubans love a fight and love to I watch one , so the noise was like ' a magnet . The real danger , as one going to the scene quickly discovered , was not from snipers in the windows of the Masferrer organization but from random shots and the careless way everyone was handling and waving his loaded weapon with the catch off . There was firing from all directions toward the wellknown Manzana de Gomez office building on the square , Crowd Is Determined There was no mistaking the ferocity of - the crowd nor its determination to break down the heavy central doors of the building and get at the men inside . The attackers poured in at 12:30 P. M. A great cheer went I up from the crowd as men and women broke from their shelter Ipoints and ran forward . Inside there was one short sudden burst of fire magnified by the echoing walls . Later L. was said that three or four of Senor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One man of about 30 being , led out was calm , expressionless and seemingly unhurt . A glimpse was all one could get , for as his captors tried to hustle I him across the wide square the I crowd piled in and it was a case of howling for blood . The man was not to be seen again . A man with long hair and a long beard , marks of the fighting troops of the 26th of July Movement , sighed . " There is a lot of confusion , " he said . As a matter of fact , the important feature of the capital today was that there was generally very little confusion . One had a feeling that order was being re-established . Men with 26th of July armbands were directing traffic . Sailors and policemen , also with the armbands , were helping . At many points around the edges of the city there were blockades along the streets and roads . These were generally manned by two or three young civilians armed with rifles who stopped cars , looked in , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , waved you on . The city was much more cheerful today . The faces in the cars and on the streets were happy . People waved to each other for no reason except that life must seem good to them today .
