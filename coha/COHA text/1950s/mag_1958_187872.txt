The world 's biggest grocery , The Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. , last week announced plans to give shareholders outside the Hartford family a vote in how the family-controlled corporation will be run . Some 19% of A. &; P. stock is now held by the public , but the shares carry no regular voting power . The move is the first step in what Wall Street believes is a plan for the heirs of A. &; P. Founder George H. Hartford* to sell part of their 81% stock interest in the food chain ( last fiscal year sales : $4.8 billion ) . <P> To lay the groundwork for the sale of stock , A. &; P. President Ralph W. Burger outlined a proposal , expected to be approved at a meeting in December , to 1 ) replace present nonvoting common and preferred stock with a single class of voting common stock ; 2 ) split all outstanding common shares on a 10-for-1 basis and issue three shares of common for each preferred share ; 3 ) apply for listing of the new common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be only a single issue of A. &; P. stock of 21,639,206 shares outstanding ( of the 28 million authorized ) when the changes are approved . Each share , both family and publicly held , will carry one vote . More shares will probably be offered later . In addition , the heirs and the Hartford charitable foundation are expected to lighten their holdings in order to diversify their investments or for inheritance tax purposes . <P> When word first circulated on Wall Street in October 1957 that a plan was being considered to broaden public ownership in the company , the nonvoting common stock was selling for about $175 a share on the American Stock Exchange . It has risen steadily since then and closed at $445 a share the day before the plan was announced . Next day it scooted up 40 points to close at week 's end at $485 . <P> <P> * Four of Founder Hartford 's grandchildren and a great-granddaughter each own 10% of the voting stock . They are George Huntington Hartford II , theatrical producer and art fancier , of Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robertson of Huntington , L.I. ; Mrs. Allan J. Mclntosh of Bedford Village , N.Y. ; and Mrs. Henry G. Carpenter of Shelter Island , N.Y . Five other descendants each own 2% of the outstanding voting stock , and another 40% is in the John A. Hartford Foundation set up by brothers John and George Hartford ( TIME , Oct. 7 , 1957 ) .
