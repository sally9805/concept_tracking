The Lost Atlantis so lavishly described by Plato has been " found " all over the world-from Ceylon to Sweden . Last week a German clergyman was writing a report on how he had found it again-this time in the North Sea . <P> Late this summer a fishing boat set out from the German port of Husum . On board was scholarly Jrgen Spanuth , pastor of the Lutheran church in Ost Bordelum , a little village behind the North Sea dikes . Also on board were a diver , a public stenographer and assorted scientific equipment . The trip was costing Pastor Spanuth 150 marks a day and would use up most of his savings , but he thought the expense would be justified . He was after the biggest treasure of all , the glittering undersea remains of Atlantis , which he was convinced from his readings of Greek and Egyptian lay just beyond the dikes of his own village . <P> " I See a Wall . " The boat circled Helgoland , the rocky island and former fortress 28 miles off the Schleswig-Holstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore and anchored 50 stadia ( 5.7 miles ) from Helgoland . The diver dropped overboard and walked along the sandy bottom 30 feet below the surface . <P> " What do you see ? " Pastor Spanuth asked him over the telephone . <P> " I see a wall , " said the diver . <P> While the stenographer wrote it down , Pastor Spanuth leaned against the gunwale , breathing hard . Plato , he was sure now , had guided him to the right spot . <P> In four more days of diving and note-taking , Spanuth found that his wall encircled an oval area 1,012 yards long and 328 yards across . Inside were irregularities that might very well be the ruins of buildings long covered by the sand . One of these buildings , Spanuth is convinced , will prove to be the palace of the Kings of Atlantis . <P> Not many serious scholars will accept Spanuth 's theory without some questions . Most believe that when Plato described Atlantis ( in the Dialogues Timaeus and Critias ) , he was merely writing a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him literally , but during the Middle Ages Plato gained such enormous authority that his political fantasy was accepted as sober fact . An Atlantis cult grew , and still flourishes . The myth has even multiplied , begetting Mu ( sunk in the Pacific ) and Lemuria ( sunk in the Indian Ocean ) . * <P> " It Is Possible . " As described by Plato , Atlantis does not sound very much like what Pastor Spanuth found . Atlantis was a very large island , as big as North Africa and Asia Minor put together , and Plato located it outside the Pillars of Hercules ( the Strait of Gibraltar ) . The land had high mountains , level plains and a network of wide canals . Its great temples were encrusted with silver and gold . Nine thousand years before Plato 's time , it sank into the sea ( the Atlantic ) . <P> But Pastor Spanuth has ways to explain away such minor difficulties . Plato , he says , was not infallible . After all , he got his information in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision .
