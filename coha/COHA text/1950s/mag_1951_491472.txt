HERE are n't many quaint characters in baseball nowadays , and the few who do come along seldom seem to have the ability to stay up in the big time . One fascinating exception is Elwin ( Preacher ) Roe , from Viola , Arkansas , the copitching ace  --  with Don Newcombe  --  of the Brooklyn Dodgers . Roe is not only the best , and skinniest , left-handed pitcher the Dodgers have had in a long while , but also something special as a personality . There is considerably more to Preacher Roe than meets the eye of the spectator in a grandstand seat . A lanky six-foot-one in height , seldom weighing as much as 170 pounds , Roe hardly looks the part of a high-priced athlete . He is the type of whom they say in the trade , " Physically , the kid 's got nothing . " 1 he consistency with which the batters fail to hithim is mystifying . However , that 's only part of it . Other pitchers of frail build have made good . Preacher Roe is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skull fractured . Roe 's appearance is deceptive in more ways than one . Watch his queer , shambling gait on the baseball field , talk with him briefly in the clubhouse , note his thin features , his almost-lantern jaw and his long , sharp-pointed nose , and you are likely to put him down as a hillbilly . Actually the Preacher  --  the boys call him Preach  --  is a college man , the son of a physician . His daddy  --  a distinctive personality in his own right  --  had the first automobile in their part of Arkansas . However , Roe 's speech has a rich back-country flavor , and once he gets to know you he will sit with you in hotel lobbies and spin yarns by the hour  --  yarns which are all the more intriguingbecause , like Dizzy Dean , Roe 's accounts of his adventures seem to vary with each telling . Roe was one of four Dodgers last year who refused to travel by air . The others were Billy Cox , Eddie Miksis and Cal Abrams . Preach 's distaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight from Vero Beach to Texas in 1948 after the Dodgers broke camp . A number of players became violently ill , including Roe . Now he brushes aside suggestions that a recently developed drug might eliminate his airsickness . Roe says that if man were meant to fly , he 'd have wings . " You see those pitchers around with a bad arm , " he drawls , " or one of those fellows with a bad ankle . They give them a shot in the arm or the leg and they go out and play . That ai n't the way with old Preach . When Nature tells him ( Continued on Page 64 ) THE DODGERS ' ODDEST STAR ( Cot xl from Page 30 ) no , it 's no . If Nature says for me not to go up in the air , I do n't go . " Preacher Roe is one of those late-blooming beauties . He did not come into his own until he turned thirty , after some of the youthful sizzle was gone from his fast one . As recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big leagues . In 1949 , however , he broke out with a fifteenand-six won-lost record , and the third-best earned-run average among the regular starters in the National League . Last year his mark was nineteen-andeleven , the same as Don Newcombe 's . Roe is also the sole National League pitcher to win a World Series game from the Yankees in the last two years . It is only in the past couple of seasons that Roe has become one of the highest-salaried pitchers in the game , but he always has been a shrewd bargainer , with a native gift for extracting the maximum number of dollars from baseball owners . Back in 1938 , when some of today 's most celebrated players were signing for bonuses of maybe $200 or $300 , Preach got $5000 to go with the St. Louis Cardinals . And that was when the Cardinal farm system was operated by Branch Rickey , a man not noted for loose handling of currency . That summer Roe had been the object of one of the most intensive talent hunts ever staged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a skinny mountain kid pitching around Arkansas for Harding College who could throw a ball through the side of a brick silo . In Little Rock , veterans recognized the name . " Roe ? Roe ? Think there was a fellow with a name like that used to pitch for Pine Bluff . He had a tryout with Memphis later . " They were right . That was Dr. Charles E. Roe , who left baseball and became a country doctor . The current wonder boy was Doctor Roe 's son . As a raw prospect in 1938 , Preacher Roe did n't have the stuff , the control and the pitching finesse that was to come to him a decade later . But he did have a sensational fast ball . In one game Preach fanned twenty-six men in thirteen innings , and the big-league scouts fell all over each other rushing back to the hotel to dash off their reports . The Cardinals had three of their scouts take a shot at Roe . They all reported back that the skinny mountain kid gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , Frank Rickey , on the phone , down in South Carolina . " It 's a matter of life and death , Frank , " began Brother Branch . " I want you to get up to a place in Arkansas called Searcy and sign a kid named Roe for me , a pitcher . " Rickey took a firm hold on himself . " Money is no object , " he breathed . " Frank arrived late at . night , " recalls Brother Branch , " and he had to make friends with a lot of dogs guarding the place . Frank is good at that . Then he did n't want to wake the family , so he stretched out on the porch , took a piece of firewood , used it for a pillow and went to sleep . When the Roes got up the next morning and saw what Frank had gone through , they told Preacher to sign with us . " There is a second version , with equally frontierlike overtones , on Frank Rickey 's introduction to the Roes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making friends with the dogs and putting up the horse in the Roe barn . Then , according to the legend , he went to sleep alongside the horse . The Roes found him there the next morning , and were so touched by his devotion to man 's second-or-thirdbest friend that they told Preach to listen attentively to whatever this honest fellow was going to tell him . At any rate , Frank described the beauties of working for the St. Louis Cardinals . Roe in turn described the beauties of having $5000 in the bank , especially since he was soon to marry Mozee Clay , of Viola , a Harding College coed . Frank Rickey called Branch . " Okay , okay , " sighed Brother Branch . " Tell him we 'll give him the $5000 . " Roe got to pitch in only one game for the Cardinals during the half-dozen years he was their property . That was at the tag end of 1938 . The next five years he spent on Triple A farm clubs  --  first Rochester , then Columbus . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Brooklyn  --  as they were to separate again last fall when Rickey moved to Pit tsburgh . Anyway , after Rickey 's departure from St. Louis , the Cardinals sold Roe to the Pittsburgh club following a good 1943 season with Columbus . Why did the Cards let a fellow like this go for $15,000 and a couple of players ? " Well , " recalled Rickey last season , " the Cards had some pretty good left-handers around that time , and Roe was still a wild kid . He did n't really achieve his artistry of pitching as we know it . until after his accident . " The accident Rickey mentioned came close to ending not only Roe 's career but his life . It happened on a cold February night in 1946 in a place called Evening Shade , Arkansas , where the finals of the Sharp County high-school basketball tournament were being held . Preach was coaching the Hardy team , which had won its way into the title round against Ash Flat . Exactly what happened that night is difficult to determine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems clear is that Preach became physically embroiled with the referee . " They tell me I slammed into the iron rail behind the bench , " Roe has said . " All I know is that they carried me off to Graves Hospital , over in Batesville , where they had me forty-one days . I had a skull fracture six and three quarter inches long in the shape of an inverted T , a one-quarterinch brain laceration , a blood clot and a concussion . " It was the second head injury Roe had sustained . A farm accident fractured his skull ten years earlier and kept him out of the Army . Preach was a long time recovering from this 1946 injury . However , he pitched again the following season , a disastrous one in which he lost fifteen and won only four for Pittsburgh . He was afflicted by dizzy spells . " Bad ! " exclaims Roe . " Why , sometimes I could n't even see the batter up there at the plate , and most of the time I could n't catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 141 pounds , he was a veritable bag of hones , and about all he wanted to do was to go somewhere and sit down . Meanwhile , Branch Rickey had been following the Roe case closely . He remembered the prewar potentialities of this fellow . He sought advice . Could a man recover from an injury of this type ? Some men might , some might not , he was advised . Rickey decided to take a chance . He called upon his Brother Frank again . " Get up to Roe 's place and spend some time with him , " ordered Branch . " I want to know just exactly what his condition and frame of mind is . " Roe 's frame of mind , at the moment , happened to be excellent . He had been up to the Mayo Clinic again , and after a two-day examination they had told him that his chances of recovery were good . Frank Rickey showed up about this time , and Roe , happy to get moving again , took him out to shoot a few birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really walked old Frank 's legs off on that one . " Frank Rickey just about made it hack to his hotel , where , before dropping into an exhausted slumber , he managed to scribble off a note to the effect that Roe was O.K. Rickey went ahead with a big December deal with the Pirates . He gave Dixie Walker , who was just about used up , and a couple of pitchers , Hal Gregg and Vic Lombardi , for Roe and two infielders , Billy Cox and Gene Mauch . As usual , Rickey got infinitely the better of the deal . Roe and Cox are Dodger regulars , while the only one left at . Pittsburgh is Lombardi , who is used only sporadically . Vic lost five decisions for the Pirates without managing to win one in 1950 . Roe felt that he could come back , but he remained cautious . After he learned he had been sold to Brooklyn , he sought a strong sea anchor . He found it in the biggest drugstore in Hardy , Arkansas , which he promptly bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on if he could n't play for Brooklyn . He felt he was getting a little too old , at thirty , for another whirl through the minor leagues . So he installed Mozee Roe as manager in charge of the soda.fountain and the five-and-dime department , and went off to play a season for the first time without her . Mozee became ill that spring , and Roe had to hurry home early in June for two weeks . Preach by now was convinced that he Could make it with Brooklyn , so they decided to sell the store . Preach went back to win a dozen games for the Dodgers that year . That was about the only time during Roe 's long career that he was separated from his family . In 1949 and 1950 his wife and the two boys , Elwin , Jr. , and Thomas , accompanied him to Vero Beach for spring training , then came north and spent the spring and summer Within reasonable distance of Ebbeta Field . Each season he has subleased a house in New Hyde Park , Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodger system , later a manager , and more lately a scout . Every time the Dodgers get to St. Louis , which is the nearest point on the National League circuit to Arkansas , Dr. Charles E. Roe leads a pilgrimage from home to watch his boy pitch . Doctor Roe now has both a son and a grandson in the Brooklyn organization . The grandson is Joseph C. Roe , nineteen-year-old son of Preach 's brother , Cecil . He was signed last year to a contract with Greenwood , Mississippi , a Dodger farm club in the Class C Cotton States League . This makes the Roes a hit unusual as a baseball family , but what tops it all off is the fact that Doctor Roe himself was still pitching semipro ball a couple of nights a week last summer at the age of sixty-six . Preach 's dad is an amazing man . He had a consuming desire to make the big leagues as a pitcher . He went into medical practice when he saw he ( =could n't , but vowed that a son would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a daughter ; one of the sons , Wayman , was killed in an automobile accident a decade ago . Of all these boys who grew up in the Roes ' rambling eight-room Douse on Route 62 in Viola , Preach was the only one who turned out to be spindly , gawky , big-jawed and sharp-featured , almost a model for one of those " mountain boys " cartoons . However , Preach was also the only one with exceptional baseball talent , aside from his older brother , Creston , who was a promising catcher until he got badly . Urt trying to ridea mule at the age of sixteen . The mule fell on Creston and fractured his thigh . The injured leg knit shorter than the other one . " He has a Short , " declares Doctor Roe . " One leg is maybe a half inch shorter than the other one . He never played much after that . " From the time Preach was able to " log rocks around the back yard , Doctor Roe pointed him for a baseball career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the equipment and uniforms out of his own Pocket . He saw to it that Preach got plenty of semipro experience , in addition to playing with the high-school team , Doctor Roe , a graduate of the Uni ? versity of Arkansas , is the only doctor Within a radius of perhaps twenty miles around Viola . Until he was forty years old he drove a buggy or rode a horse to visit patients in the more inaccessible portions of his district . Fording a river in the dead of winter , his medical accouterments stashed in saddlebags held high over his head , was routine . Later he became the first man in the section to own an automobile . It was a Model T , and it was an absolute sensation , both in the Roe household and throughout the neighboring countryside . Like his son Preach , Doctor Roe came through a terrible accident without any apparent permanent effect . He was in an auto wreck ten years ago while returning from an afternoon call on an old lady suffering from a stroke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at about four in the afternoon , and was n't too far from the house . There was another fellow coming down the other side of the road and he was going too fast . It might have been about eighty-five . The sun got into his eyes and he never did see me . We smashed head on . " Doctor Roe 's battered body was flung from his wrecked car by the impact and he lay in the road . A farmer passing in a pickup truck stopped , lifted him into the back , then , realizing that the victim was the only doctor in the area , carried him to the nearest hospital , which was in Gassville . Doctor Roe 's injuries were serious . He had suffered a basal fracture of the skull , a smashed hip and a wicked fracture of the left leg . They moved him to a big hospital in Little Rock . " 1 was unconscious for ten days , " he says . " They had to take 137 stitches in my hip . " Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty days of prac-tice ! " Like his father , Preach is a captivating personality . Except for that great little veteran , Pee Wee Reps , Roe is probably as popular with newspaper people as any player on the Dodgers . The writers love his stories , in which 50 per cent of the delivery is through teeth clenched on a pipestem . In the lobby of Boston 's Hotel Kenmore one afternoon last season , the talk got around to tough ballplayers  --  the kind of fellows who not only could take excellent care of themselves in a dark alley but who would go looking for an alley . " I 've never seen a ballplayer able to really use his hands , " observed a fledgling writer . " They all run off at the mouth , or they bump bellies and wait for an umpire to come running over to separate them . If the umpire would go in the other direction and take a seat to watch the fun , they would n't know what to do . " " When you say you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you never saw Mickey Finn , " declared a seasoned Brooklyn observer . " I once saw him give Billy Jurges a pretty good going-over . And Jurges was n't doing any running away , either . " From there the talk got around to knives and guns and ballplayers who carried them . Roe remembered two gun oters . Strangely enough , both were his roommates hack in his International League days at Rochester . " There was this fellow I first roomed with , " explained Roe . " He had that gun with him all the time . He carried it in a little case like the kind you carry for shaving stuff on the trains . On the field he carried the gun in his hip pocket . I think some woman 's husband was after him or something , because he was ready to use it any time . Boy , I 'm telling you . Just imagine trying to slide with that thirty-eight in your hip pocket . " When I first got to rooming with John , he told me , ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late at night . I do n't mind being awoke at all . I 'd rather be awoke than shoot you ! ' He slept with that gun under his pillow . " ' Preach , ' he used to say , if you get up at night and have to go to the bathroom , just shake me and tell me . ' He was a funny guy . " One night I went to the bathroom and forgot to wake him . He must have heard me in there , because when I got out and started over to my bed , I found him standing in the middle of the room holding the gun in his hand . ' I thought I told you to wake me , ' he says . I always made sure after that . " Someone turned off Roe with a story about a pitcher the Yankees once had by the name of Two-Gun Collins . " He was a Texas Ranger , or something , " mused the storyteller , " and he looked it , all sunburnt and hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never bothered anyone with them until one night on the train when he got into a poker game . He sat down to play , and he drew the guns out of the holsters under his coat . He laid them down on the table without saying a word . Sammy Vick , an outfielder , was sitting opposite . He did n't say a word , either . He just toppled over backward , chair and all . " Roe laughed and then continued as though there had been no interruption . " This other fellow with me up in Rochester had a .38 on a .45 frame . He wore it in a belt holster with a full load of bullets all around . It had Western silver trimmings and everything . Thing was always loaded too . " He used to leave it in the clubhouse when he pitched , but would put it hack on as soon as he got dressed . On the trains he 'd sit and read those Western stories , and when it got to the part where someone would draw  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw too . " He really had a fancy draw , " continued Roe . " He 'd twirl that gun around on his finger , and no one would smile , either . I guess he was just a fellow who was nuts about guns . I remember he used to use his hands pretty good , and he was pretty big . He did n't need any guns to protect him . I guess he just liked them . " Five minutes later Roe was registering acute indignation over a story in a Boston paper that he had beaten the Braves the night before by chicanery ; that he had been applying moisture to the ball from the sweat under his arm . Roe relit his pipe , puffed furiously . " How do you like that kind of stuff ? It 's a cinch the guy that wrote that never saw me pitch . " He held up his cigarette lighter . " I never sweated any bigger than that , " he intoned , using the cigarette lighter as a comparable measurement for a theoretical patch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the World Series last year . Was I sweat-ing ? " Those who had talked with him shortly after he had shut out the Yankees for Brooklyn 's only 1949 Series victory admitted that his undershirt was n't even damp . It was in this game , incidentally , that an accident occurred that caused Roe to ask out of a pitching assignment for the one and only time in his life . It caused ill feeling between Roe and Rickey for the only time . Rickey , who said that Roe 's inability to pitch another game of the 1949 Series was " the greatest disappointment in my life , " did n't know that Roe had suffered a broken finger midway in the game he won ; that despite the injury he went on to whitewash the mighty Yankees with half a dozen hits . It happened in the fourth inning , with Johnny Lindell , the Yankee outfielder , at the plate . There were two out , and Lindell took a mighty cut at the ball . It went back to the mound like a rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective move that was pure reflex . The ball , a white blur , smashed against the tip of the fourth finger of his glove hand . Waves of pain chased each other up Roe 's arm , but his brain registered the fact that the ball was not in his glove , and that Lindell was tearing down to first base . Roe looked around quickly , spotted the ball , picked it up with his still-good left hand  --  his pitching hand  --  and whipped it over to Gil Hodges . Lindell wound up as the third out . It was n't learned until after Roe had gone back to Arkansas that Lindell 's smash had cracked the finger in three places . At the time , it appeared to be only a terrific bruise . Harold Wendler , the Dodger trainer , had relieved the pressure by punching a hole in Roe 's fingernail with a little drill . Rickey had joined in the locker-room revelry , to the extent of chasing Roe under the shower to continue congratulating him . He was insistent that Roe see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid his farewell call upon Rickey , instead of a cordial greeting he received angry Words of reproach . Roe turned on his heel and left , Rickey 's words stinging his ears . Rickey still did n't know that the finger was broken . He learned about it later in the fall . That may explain why , when Roe subsequentlyasked for an extra $500 over the figure Rickey quoted him for his 1950 contract , Rickey merely smiled and said , " Certainly , my boy . " On the road , Preacher Roe 's roommate since confing to Brooklyn has been Billy Cox , a taciturn , pinch-featured fellow whose throw from third to first base resembles a rattlesnake 's strike . The Roe-Cox combination is a strange one . Roe loves to talk , but Cox , a fellow from the country behind Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , never spoke much to begin with , according to people who have - known him a long time , and some rough war experiences have made him even more tight-lipped . He 's a pretty handy fellow to have going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back home , in the off season , Roe has nothing to do with baseball . He reads the Sporting News , the trade Paper , but mainly concerns himself with bunting and fishing . He is a fine fly caster . There is plenty of good fishing around his home . Preach also has a passel of relatives to account for his socializing time . His sister and all his brothers except Creston  --  forty-four and the oldest ? live close by . Creston works for a packinghouse in Wenatchee , Washington , but Glenn , the next oldest , is a contractor laWest Plains , Missouri ; Cecil is a car-penter at the Bull Shoals Darn , in Mountain Home , Arkansas , and Roy is superintendent of schools at Hardy , Arkansas . The sister , Eagle , is married to O. T. Franks , a disabled war veteran , and lives in West Plains . The question of how Preacher Roe came by his nickname is another item on which there are differing stories . The authorized version seems to be that some kinfolk were sitting around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , when an uncle beckoned to little Elwin Charles . " Bet you ca n't tell me your name , " he said , in the tradition of all doting uncles . Elwin Charles was silent . " C'm on , " coaxed the uncle . " Tell me your name and I 'll give you a nickel . " Elwin Charles thought a while . " Preacher , " he lisped . The uncle was taken aback slightly , but stuck to his offer . " Okay , ' Preacher , ' here 's your nickel , " he said . " That was the first and easiest nickel I made in my life , " Roe has said . " I figured that if Preacher was good for that kind of money , I 'd stick with it , so Preacher it 's been . " At any rate , Preach still has some lingering affection for his given name of Elwin Charles , as witnessed by the fact that he named his first son thusly . " I feel that the oldest boy should be named after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Preach signs all his contracts Elwin Charles . As previously mentioned , they 're pretty fair contracts too . About $1000 per 1950 victory would be a good guess as to his 1951 salary . If total victories are the gauge to a pitcher 's pay , it 's too bad that Brooklyn went into a state of virtual collapse almost every time Roe got to pitch in the last five weeks of the season . They simply could n't get him any runs . Roe won No. 17 on August twenty-fourth , but from that point won only two more and lost four . Thus he just missed becoming Brooklyn 's first twenty-gamewinning left-hander since before World War I. To resort to an overworked phrase , Roe is a " pitchers ' pitcher . " He does n't knock the fans out of their seats ; he does n't blow down the batters with a blazing delivery . He just gets them out , and the people in the stands wonder how he does it . The rival batters know . They know he 's outthinking them most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strike zone , shooting for the corners of the plate . Unless they swing at his stuff , they wind up taking a called strike . And if they do swing , they usually get only a piece of it , for an easy out . Yet Roe also has led the Dodger pitchers for two straight years in giving up home runs . How come ? Baseball people have a paradoxical explanation . " Anyone hitting a homer off Roe , " they explain , " does it off his own batting weakness . Roe knows what the batIer 's weakness is and pitches to it . The batter gets lucky and catches one and knocks it out of the park . " Does that make any difference to Roe ? No . He pitches them the same way the next time up , and they do n't hit homers off him the second time . The percentages now are working for Roe again , and he gets them out . " A fellow like that , " Roe boosters conclude , " can go on winning for twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that he is n't pitching with his arm any more , but only with his brain . "
