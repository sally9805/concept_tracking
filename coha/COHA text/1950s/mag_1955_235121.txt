Before they conquered the mainland in 1949 , the Chinese Communists could claim few scientists . Afterwards , Chinese scientists were promised heaven and earth and rapid promotion if they stayed on or came back from overseas . Reluctant to leave home , all but a handful of China 's physicists , chemists and mathematicians went to work for the Reds . A survey prepared for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Center for International Studies , released last week , offers a tentative look at the fate of Chinese scientists under the Red regime . Conclusion : once wooed and rewarded , Chinese scientists are now feeling the Red pinch . <P> At least three leading experts-Mathematician Hua Lo-keng , Geologist Li Ssukuang and Dr. Wong Wen-hao-voluntarily returned to the mainland from the West . Without a shot or a kidnaping , the Communists quickly recruited an invaluable braintrust : 233 topflight scientists and 691 second-stringers . Ironically , 35 of the 50 most talented were educated in the West , 25 in the U.S. Only eight of these leaders were known to have any pro-Communist leanings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> At first the Reds lived up to their promises of special treatment . Fifteen scientists got elected to the National People 's Congress , more than from any other profession . Most of the non-Communists continued to teach , serving the government on a part-time basis . Some went to key technical jobs in the Ministry of Water Conservation , the Bureau of Railroad Research , the Ministry of Forestry . All got more pay and faster promotion than colleagues in the social sciences , regardless of party standing . <P> Today the Red squeeze is on . One prominent American-trained psychologist , Lu Chih-wei , was liquidated when he refused to sign an anti-American testimonial ; others have been pressured into phony confessions and self-ridicule . What hurts most is the enforcement of Communism 's concept of science as a political and social weapon rather than a " bourgeois " search for truth . Meteorologists were ordered to " learn from Chairman Mao 's statement on party doctrine . " At a conference of mathematicians , one topic was " How to Realize Patriotism Through Education in Mathematics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chemistry , Tseng Chao-lun , confessed his organization 's past errors in adopting " Anglo-American " laboratory methods , called for a " patriotic " reorientation . <P> Red officials are taking sole credit for every major technical achievement . Party chiefs , rather than scientific experts , boss Red China 's biggest projects , e.g. , the taming of the Hwai River , with a resulting emphasis on hand labor rather than new machines . Concludes the M.I.T. survey : " It is a sad day for the ' bourgeois scientists , ' who must sit inactively watching the wastefulness of the Communist method of organizing masses to perform unskilled tasks .
