All Comers Met In his deadpan , wryly humorous column , Meeting All Comers , in the Houston Post , H. ( for Hubert ) Mewhinney has earned a reputation as the city 's know-it-all . He advises readers on such diverse subjects as how to rid their chimneys of bats , how to tell a male cocklebur from a female cocklebur ( a female has burs ) , and whether armadillos are good to eat ( they are ) . No one catches H. Mewhinney with his patter down . When one fan insisted that bookkeeper was the only English word with three double letters , Mewhinney gave him at least three more : " Poo-peepee ( a seaman who is peeped at from a poop deck ) , raccoonnookkeeper ( the custodian of a coon hollow ) and barroom-moodduller ( one who dulls the jovial mood in a barroom ) . " When another reader asked him to explain the Truman Doctrine in one-syllable words , Mewhinney obliged-in 285 one-syllable words . <P> When one reader contended that the inside of a watermelon is white until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely answered : " On July 10 , 1893 , Dr. Ebenezer P. Humford , F.R.S. , LL.D. , F.L.S. , Ph.D. , succeeded in slicing a watermelon inside a glass-encased vacuum at Wallace-Huxley Technological Institute , Hyannis , Neb . Wholly untouched by oxygen , the melon was red . " An impressed reporter asked how he could remember so many facts . Soberly , Mewhinney said : " I am blessed with total recall . " <P> A longtime newsman ( 26 years , nine papers ) , 46-year-old Texan Mewhinney does not regard himself as a columnist but as a " pick &; shovel newspaperman , " and still spends part of his week as a rewrite man . But his vast curiosity and freewheeling pedantry make him an ideal man for Meeting All Comers . In his spare time , he reads Latin , has taught himself to play the piano and has become a self-confessed authority on arrowhead making , jazz , Government regulations , paleontology , ornithology and coon-hunting . <P> Unlike most columnists , Mewhinney tries to discourage letter writers . His reasons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper readers are either silly or ignorant . For years , the most famous men in England have written letters to the Times . In this country , the people who write letters for the newspaper editorial pages are mostly screwballs , nincompoops or monomaniacs . But the newspapers keep right on printing them .
