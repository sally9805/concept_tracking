POETS IN A LANDSCAPE ( 267 pp. ) - Gilbert Highet-Knopf ( $6.50 ) . <P> OVID 'S THE ART OF LOVE ( 206 pp. ) - translated by Rolfe Humphries-Indiana University ( $3.75 ; paperback , $1.45 ) . <P> <P> A book is born ; a classic is forever reborn . Each generation supplies its own Pygmalions-men with the love and skill to breathe new life into the literary monuments of the past . As Pygmalions to the ancient Roman poets , two lifelong classics scholars and teachers , Gilbert Highet ( Columbia ) and Rolfe Humphries ( now a lecturer at New York City 's Hunter College after 32 years at Long Island 's Woodmere Academy ) , have love and skill to spare . Poet Humphries renders Ovid 's famed , amoral The Art of Love in its most readable translation since Dryden 's , including in his book much of Ovid 's remaining love poetry . Critic Highet assembles an ingratiating montage of seven Latin poets ( Catullus , Vergil , Propertius , Horace , Tibiillus . Ovid . Juvenal ) , combining samples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a latter-day tour of his heroes ' haunts . <P> A Pang Among Flowers . Highet 's book places its poets at their geographical point of departure ( Catullus at Verona , Vergil near Mantua , etc. ) and takes them to their common destination . Rome . Even more fascinating than their individual styles and talents , which Author Highet expertly analyzes , is a common historical drama linking the seven together in a way which Author Highet suggests but perhaps never sufficiently emphasizes . The eldest , Catullus , died around 54 B.C. , ten years before Caesar was assassinated ; the youngest , Juvenal , was born around 60 A.D. , six years after Nero came to power . In little more than a century these poets witnessed the death of the republic and the rise and corruption of the empire . Whether lyric or satiric , they were poets of disenchantment ( " A bitterness arose , a pang among the flowers " ) , and melancholy broods between their lines . <P> They were double men , harking back nostalgically to the rustic , roughhewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while themselves breathing the elegant , enervating and sometimes fetid air of imperial Rome . They tended to polish more than to publish . Only Vergil attempted the epic , and he thought so poorly of The Aeneid that on his deathbed he asked to destroy the manuscript . Catullus , Propertius and Tibullus were ravaged by hard-boiled mistresses , and their poems tell of virtually the only battle they ever fought-the war between the sexes . They knew or sensed that their culture was on its long day 's journey into night-and suggested mostly pleasure to ease the journey . But they were not without stoic courage , and Catullus could spurn Caesar with an epigram : <P> I am not really anxious for your approval , Caesar . <P> Whether you 're white or black , I do not care .
