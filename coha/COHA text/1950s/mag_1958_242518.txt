Already on the skids , aggressive young Army Colonel Abdul Salam Mohammed Aref , 38 , who longed to be the Nasser of Iraq , had to take a much harder bump last week . A month ago Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kassem removed his fellow conspirator in the Baghdad revolt from the army second-in-command . Last week , as armored cars trundled through the streets , Baghdad radio broadcast that " in the public interest " Aref had been dismissed from his two ministerial posts and banished to the ambassadorship to West Germany . Two other Cabinet ministers , who wanted union now with Nasser , also lost their posts . <P> Kassem pronounced himself still an admiring brother of Nasser , but he was plainly not ready to become a satellite . Instead , he pushed on with his own Nasser-like program in Iraq . Kassem created a new state agency empowered to strip Iraq 's feudal landlords of all but 250 acres of irrigated land , 500 acres of nonirrigated land . Within five years , the state promised to hand out this land to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up cooperatives to help the peasants get started , and pay off the expropriated owners in 20-year government bonds . Kassem was taking on what old Nuri asSaid , for all his enlightened oil-revenue spending , never dared tackle-the opposition of feudal landholders who have wielded almost absolute local power , and in cases exacted up to 90% of tenants ' earnings as rent , and in their own courts could inflict even flogging on sharecroppers who defrauded . <P> If Kassem can bring off land reform , he will not need to worry about his popularity with the Iraqi masses who were busy last week snipping out Aref 's face from the posters saluting " Kassem and Aref , Heroes of the Revolution .
