Ever since the early 18th Century the East German cathedral town of Meissen ( pop . 48,000 ) has been famed for fine china . Little damaged during World War II , it went on , under the Russian thumb , producing traditional luxury ware , even though a single Meissen cup cost upwards of 50 East marks-more than the average weekly salary of an East German workman . Last week Meissen was busy reorienting itself to the new order in East Germany . In place of its world-famed baroque " Red Dragon , " " Green Ivy " and " Onion " ( blue &; white ) patterns , it was setting out to shift " without artistic loss ... to the sound , lively and folk-based realism of our time . " Among the approved new themes : " work , sports and reconstruction . " But Meissen may also continue to make an occasional fancy item for export purposes , such as the elaborate porcelain group entitled Victory of the People that it recently forwarded to the Kremlin .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
