THE CHANCES are overwhelming that sometime during the coming year you will be approached by the operator of some scheme for getting your money without any adequate return . Whether he succeeds or fails , you will find that nothing can be done about it . He is an honest businessman , working within the law , or at least so close to the edge of it that the district attorney is unwilling to tackle the case , especially for the amount involved . For the modern successors of Buck Boatwright and Yellow Kid Weil do n't want much of your money . They may hit you for as little as a five-spot , and if they get up into the altitude brackets above a hundred dollars , they leave you with something like a vacuum cleaner or a TV set that can be represented ( however implausibly ) as legitimate merchandise . This does not mean that they are small-time operators . One gentleman with a five-dollar take racket had reached the satisfactory income of $7,500 a month before the Post Office moved in on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " big store " ? a completely phony race-track betting room or stock brokerage house , with helpers playing the parts of employees and customers . Then he went looking for someone who already had quite a lot of money and was willing to make more by none too scrupulous methods . After a series of often brilliantly conducted operations , the " mark " found himself poorer by a sum which occasionally reached all the way up to $65,000 and was seldom less than $10,000 . Then , in the middle twenties , the FBI entered the picture , with authority to take charge in any case involving more than $5,000 . Now it is a known fact of swindling that you can often put in the fix with the local law ? one gang operated out of Denver for years ? but federal law is something else . Also the FBI , with its elaborate files and far-flung organization , had an annoying habit of picking up a man in Dallas just when he thought he was secure after having made a particulayly fine score in Minneapolis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually variations of the gypsy switch where bundles of paper are skillfully substituted for bundles of bills . The Spanish prisoner is also still around , but he has become a Mexican prisoner and operates by correspondence from south of the Rio Grande where the G-men find it hard to get at him . And he is usually careful enough to ask for a sum just under what would involve the FBI in the case . But the genuine Big Con has withered and become a part of history , along with the mountain men and the Confederate States of America . The boys have decided to go legitimate . This process has involved appealing to the mass market , and as people in the mass market arc not apt to have either $10,000 or any intention of beating the stock market or the race track on a large scale , the machine has had to change gears to find something that will tempt the ordinary , quite honest citizen into spending a little of his money in the hope of making more , or of obtaining something of greater value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will get past the guard set by newspapers and periodicals on the advertising they take , and escape the attention of the Post Office for at least long enough to let the operator make a handsome profit before complaints begin to come in and orders to cease and desist go out . It has to be something so ingeniously novel that the prospect wonders why nobody ever thought of that before , and yet something so close to legality that swindling can be indignantly denied . These are hard conditions . They have been met with dazzling skill and by a system of remote control . A woman in Maine finds an ad about doing lucrative work at home in her local paper and writes to the firm in Seattle which placed it ; in return for $3 she gets an instruction book on how to dig a pond in her back yard and stock it with marketable fish . Somebody rings your doorbell with a package for the Smiths next door , who arc not at home right now ; will you pay the COD charges ? ( This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file at least a clipped coupon from the Smiths expressing interest in his probably quite worthless merchandise . ) Or you solve the puzzle propounded over TV and get a certificate entitling you to $50 worth of sash weights . And the rest of the list is equally familiar . THE MODERN TWIST -N , OS T modern operators pick up some lona- known scheme and use their in-long genuity to give it a twist that makes it practically unrecognizable . Eventually all the possible changes are rung and a certain type of operation goes out of style for a while , to be replaced by one that has lain fallow . Nobody has bought any gold bricks for quite a while , so the deal is probably about to come back . As a result , money-making schemes tend to run to type and the ordinary citizen can protect himself by being alert enough to recognize a typical operation . The vast majority of nothingfor-something propositions now on the market fall into five classes , with a certain amount of cross-pollination : vending machines , borne improvements , money-making work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise , and lottery tickets . The home-improvements racket has been so thoroughly discussed in FHA investigations that it would be redundant to go into it here . Lottery tickets are another matter . Their sale is illegal in most jurisdictions , so both operator and purchaser know at the start that they are on the shady side of the law . The new gimmick in this deal is that it has been taken up by a lot of the boys who used to make accurate copies of the certificates bearing the portraits of Hamilton and Jackson . It is not technically a crime to counterfeit a ticket in the Cuban National Lottery or the Irish Sweepstakes , even though the cops may find clever ways of being nasty when they catch you at it . And the mark has no way of knowing when he has been taken . All he ever learns is that the ticket he bought did n't win . It is thus about as safe as a racket can be . The main difficulty lies in the pushing . A counterfeit twenty can be passed anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crap game . Disposing of phony lottery tickets requires a build-up . The salesman has to establish himself in some area ? usually a factory or a big office ? as a person of probity and unusual resources . This takes time , and as time cuts down on the profits , the racket is not as popular as it might be . At the opposite end of the scale are the salesmen who run so close to the law that very often no charge at all can be brought against them . A typical example is a wandering merchant , who has operated fur stores all the way from upper New York State to Oklahoma , always on the same lines . A grand opening is announced in the local papers , with an ad saying : " Just count the stars in this ad , " and offering as a prize a credit certificate for $25 and up to be used on the purchase of furs . Both the prices and quality of his furs have led to complaints . But there is nothing illegal about the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , did n't they ? A similar operator is the grief-stricken individual who has been touring the country for some time , advertising in every town where he can get the paper to take the ad : " Mink stole . Wife passed away . Cost $550 . Will sacrifice for $100 , " The quality of the furs thus disposed of may be imagined , but once again there is no redress . Persuasiveness is the essential element in all these sales schemes and the contest approach is a good one . You solve the crossword puzzle or guess the tune on TV and find that you have won a credit on the beautiful vacuum cleaner displayed with the come-on . A salesman calls . It turns out that your electricity is DC while the advertised cleaner will work only on AC . But the company is not going to let you down . It has another vacuum cleaner that will suit your current perfectly , a little more expensive than the one you thought you were getting almost free , but the credit will apply on it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " bait advertising " game and it has dozens of ramifications . In the mail you get a " claim stub " and a notice that a Christmas package is being held for you ; return the stub with $1.98 and it 's yours . It will hold a pen and pencil set that you could have bought at Woolworth 's , het it 's a legal sale . THE FABULOUS WILLIAM SONS 0 NL Y rarely do operators in this field become greedy enough to slip . For example , the Williamsons , a nomadic family all inter-allied by marriage , have for more than fifteen years been touring the country , peddling worthless merchandise from door to door and seldom drawing more than a thirty-day sentence and an order to get out of town . As far back as 1936 they were selling fur coats to selected lists of school teachers at $100 a coat , explaining to each prospect that they had been given her name by a friend and that this was a sacrifice . The coats developed holes within five days . More recently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persian rugs that never saw Iran , and , above all , English woolens , with markings bearing a crest and a guarantee from Bradford , England . This strange tribe of gypsies , who are not gypsies by blood , meet , intermingle , exchange members , and breed on the road . They live in motels and park near race tracks , always a good market for their operations . There is hardly a town in the United States they have not visited . They travel in the best of cars and are alwaysmeticulously dressed . Many of the girls are pretty blondes and the men arc highly presentable . Their approaches are various . A young man with a fine Scots accent explains how he came by the tweeds and woolens . A pair of the girls with just a trace of brogue sorrowfully describe the recent death of their mother and why they must sell off the laces which are their only inheritance . ( In Catholic districts the laces were always made by kindly nuns . ) Another Williamson trick in rural districts is to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering to paint roofs or barns with a " guaranteed aluminum spray paint . " They do it too , but the paint washes off in the first rain . A Williamson team , which numbers from two to six members , will normally collect $400 or $500 in a day or two of operations ? despite the fact that Chambers of Commerce and Better Business Bureaus everywhere have issued warning after warning about them . They have an elaborate knowledge of local law and seldom engage in anything that will bring really serious charges against them . To be sure , one of the Williamson women and her three children , aged 24 , 22 , and 21 , were caught in Norwalk , Connecticut , last October and got thirty days apiece for receiving money under false pretenses . But at about the same time a couple of Williamson men showed up in Belle Glade , Florida , their cars loaded with the cheapest kind of rayon tagged as British woolens . When the police caught up with them , they discovered there were also some genuine woolens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , to the accompaniment of some verbal and physical sleight of hand , the talk shifted to the rayons . The only legitimate charge against the salesmen was house-to-house peddling without a license , and they even got out of that by sacrificing their very modest bail . THE HOMEWORK BUSINESS ERHAPS the most heartless of the mod-ern money-coaxing schemes are those con-nected with earning at home . just as the Wil-liamsons are the archetypical operators in the quick-load sales field , so the homework business has its Napoleon in one Earl Wilson . of various addresses in Minnesota and California . He has been head of no less than thirty-one enterprises , dealing in matters as various as breeding chin-chillas and Angora rabbits , assembling ties and baby bootees from materials , growing miniature trees , addressing envelopes , and , rather incredibly , searching for missing persons . He has also been placed under hack by the FTC , the Post Office , and almost every other organization that has been able to identify a new homework plan as a Wilson promotion , but the main result so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed . The schemes for breeding rabbits and chinchillas ( parent stock sold by Wilson ) are , of course , very similar to the old Florida frog farms which used to have such an appeal for suckers . Wilson 's new gimmick was offering to buy large quantities of the fur produced . One of his most ingenious schemes was his **25;952;TOOLONG plan . It began with a carefully worded , apparently straightforward ad iu local newspapers : TYPISTS , sorters , assemblers , longhand addressers needed by large mail order concern . Piece work . Home , Sparetime . International Enterprises , 216 West Jackson Boulevard , Chicago , 111 . Answers produced a three-page letter telling the recipient how much money could be made addressing envelopes and asking for $5 for a hook of instructions . The latter turned out to be a 32-page pamphlet , accompanied by an order blank for 200 more of the three-page letters and 200 envelopes , both for another $5 . The addresser was now in business for himself ; he sent out the 200 letters to persons of his own selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first answerer could keep $2.50 of it and pass the rest along to International Enterprises , which would forward the book . The particular beauty of this scheme is that it contained -a built-in snowballing feature . Those who bit became accomplices and by thetime complaints began to reach the newspapers , the thing was so large it was no longer necessary to advertise . This was the promotion that netted $7,500 a month , and it proved so successful that it has been widely imitated . The tie and baby bootee scheme are closer to the rabbit production program . Wilson has used at least eight firm names on them ? common practice , since no firm could long exist in the face of the inevitable wave of complaints . The ads are in Help Wanted form ; respondents can obtain a pattern and materials for four ties for $10 . The company will pay $2.30 for each first-grade tie and 75 ? for each second . The point is that the customer seldom succeeds in making a first-grade tie , or even a second . Most have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sewing expert in Boston , who was willing to spend $10 to see how far the thing would be carried . The search for missing persons remains Wilson 's most bizarre and original creation . This offered a promise of big returns , and many of the contact ads were placed in detective story magazines , presumably on the theory that the readers of this class of literature would make good prospects . According to Wilson 's story , there are hundreds of missing persons in the country and rewards out for nearly all of them , all the way up to $5,000 . Members of his missing-persons research organization were authorized to keep the reward on each and every missing person they found . All you had to do was pay your annual dues ( $5 ) . buy and study a manual on missing-persons research ( another $5 and a volume which solemnly advised the reader to look up names in telephone books and city directories ) , and subscribe to his " Journal of Missing Persons " ( $3 ) . WHAT COULD BE FAIRER ? N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrisome to the authorities because there is so little basis for legal action ? is the vending-machine racket . And let it be noted before going any farther that not all vending machines are rackets or the product of rackets . The vending machine business is a thoroughly legitimate enterprise ; in fact , one of the basic characteristics of modern swindles , as opposed to the classic Yellow Kid Weil type , is that they adopt a protective coloration as close as possible to the operations of some legitimate business . The vending machine racket begins with a classified ad in the " business opportunities " section of the newspaper . If the paper looks up the firm placing the ad or the prospect does later , they will find impeccable bank references and frequently Chamber of Commerce references on file . The ads are directed at people with a small fixed income and some savings who want to make a little money ? widows , retired persons living on pensions , and so on . The ad offers a brilliant opportunity in a service business requiring no experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it will be covered by stock . Write Box 1241 for appointment . The appointment invariably takes place in a hotel room at some such hour as nine in the evening to emphasize how busy these people are . There the prospect meets ( let us say ) Mr. John Doe and his assistant . There is always one assistant , sometimes two ; the operators have learned that the best way of putting on pressure is applying it double . Mr. John Doe exhibits his credentials and invites the prospect to check them . He is the " authorized independent distributor " for the Coronet Vending Machine Corporation . He explains that Coronet has decided to move into this particular city and set up vending machines at various points . The prospect has a chance at an exclusive territory , which will be covered by a minimum of ten machines . The machine 's dispense different articles according to the fashion . Two years ago it was mostly salted nuts . in 1953 chlorophyll pills , this year pocket packages of Kleenex . Mr. Doe has elaborate charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine is emptied . All he has to do is buy the machines , ten or twenty of them at $100 apiece , and service them . Every other detail has been taken care of . The source of supply has been set up and it is a legitimate firm which will give wholesale rates ? a fact that can be checked by telephone . Coronet has already made contacts with people who will allow the prospect to place the machines in locations where there is heavy traffic . Just sign the order here . In a few cases , notably with chlorophyll pills , you do n't even have to buy the machines . Mr. Doe loans or gives them to you , with thestatement : " My business is selling chlorophyll pills . " What could be fairer ? Well , a lot of things . The victim never knows , or only discovers much later , that he could have bought the same vending machines from the manufacturer for $20 each . The " heavy traffic locations " turn out to be a small garage , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people feel the need for salted almonds or chlorophyll pills or Kleenex , and where the proprietor wants 10 to 25 per cent of the take for allowing the machines to be put in . It is altogether probable that there are two or three other sets of machines in the " exclusive territory . " The machines gross six dollars a month instead of the $50 indicated by the chart ; also they get out of order . By the time the buyer has made these discoveries Mr. John Doe has long since checked out of his hotel and left a forwarding address in Florida or Arizona . A letter to the Coronet Vending Corporation produces a dignified reply that they will get in touch with their authorized independent distributor , Mr. Doe , and urge him to correct matters at once , but as he is an independent distributor they are not responsible for his actions . Letters of complaint to Mr. Doe bring no response . Further letters to Coronet produce promises until the day , some six months later , when a letter of protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of these vending-machine corporations is accurately calculated in terms of how long it will take the customers to become so troublesome that they can not be bothered with . It is easy enough to found a new firm . The case of the chlorophyll pills with its " free " machines is a variation of the racket . Here the operator 's business is indeed selling chlorophyll pills ; he insists that along with his machines the victim take enough of them to supply his community with chlorophyll pills for approximately twenty years , at the usual 5 to 1 mark-up price . Aside from one single case in California where two operators overstepped the line a trifle and drew a fraud conviction , no one has yet gone to jail for the vending-machine racket , which is essentially nothing more than making a 500 per cent overcharge and inducing the customer to buy through high-pressure methods . Outside of these promotions which are met with daily . lie a small number of specialty operations . Promoters arc still active with the " mug book , " or compendium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain is conditioned by the number of copies you buy . The coupon book only works once in a while in a given area , but when it does , it works hard . The promoters approach a series of merchants with a sensational new advertising scheme . Will you , a beauty shop operator , give free hair-dos to five or six persons as promotion for a contest which will he played up GOES LEGIT to find it again , and as an operation they have the advantage of being absolutely law-proof ? no district attorney will touch a " religion . " A typical example of these is run by a man who has already served at least four terms for various swindles . It operates solely by correspondence , assuring its members that the head of the cult will pray for them daily , and sending them a verse from the Bible once a month to study . The collection is $5 a month a head . Curiously , almost all modern swindles have all over town and will attract to your place countless customers you never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six eating jobs on the same basis ? When enough merchants have signed up to make the total value of their services or goods amount to $40 or S50 , coupon books arc printed up , each coupon entitling the holder to the article in question . The promised ballyhoo consists in calling up every woman in town and asking her some such question as who invented the electric light bulb or the telephone . The correct answer is greeted with : " Oh , you lucky girl . This allows you one of our coupon books for $2.95 , and you will get $40 worth of goods and services , Let me read you the list . " ? By time the beauty parlor operator discovers she has contracted to give five or six hundred free hair-dos instead of five or six , the promoters are out of town . THERE are also a small number of religious cults which are at least suspicious . They are especially designed to attract older people who have lost their religion and are tryingone feature in common . They lay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These make up mailing lists . " Once bitten , twice shy " does not apply to the swindles racket . With astonishing frequency , the customer is good for a reload . The man who has bought an expensive home improvement deal or a little covey of vending machines will almost certainly be good for some form of homework promotion . The purchaser of English woolens is probably worth approaching with a " reconditioned " vacuum cleaner , the man who has won a prize in the Irish Sweepstakes ( names printed in the papers ) is an obvious target for a mail-order Cuban lottery ticket . As the warnings of Better Business Bureaus and Chambers of Commerce have tended to make the newspapers shirty about accepting the right kind of advertising , mailing lists thus compiled have ' become of crucial importance to the business . They sell all the way from one cent a name for an ordinary home-work list up to ten cents a name for those who have been bitten on vending machines or mink stoles . So if you get caught on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the boys will be back for more .
