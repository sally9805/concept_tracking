As a boy in Brooklyn , mop-haired , zoot-suited Barry Jacobs had every opportunity to get sharpened up . His father , a bail bondsman , not only made a lucrative career out of springing prostitutes for onetime Crime King " Lucky " Luciano , but turned state 's evidence when the roof fell in and got off without a bruise . Barry , however , was both stupid and unlucky . He had hardly started a career as a holdup man at the age of 16 before he was nabbed by the cops . At 18 he found himself doing time in a reformatory . Last week , out on parole and 20 , he swaggered out to try again . <P> He called on one John Green , a young Negro he had known in prison , " bought " a .22 pistol from him for $20 , and invited Green along because he had " a good job setup in The Bronx . " On the way , they prowled a dark Greenwich Village street , stuck up a frightened couple and stole $12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bronx , it became embarrassingly evident that he had n't really planned a big robbery at all . <P> Just then , however , an automobile stopped and was parked near the shadows in which Jacobs and Green were loitering . A woman got out of it and headed for a nearby house . The driver , a middle-aged man , stayed behind to lock the automobile 's doors . Jacobs muttered , " This is it . " He sidled up to the man , poked him in the ribs with the pistol and ordered him to get back behind the wheel . The victim , a warehouse supervisor named Alfred McCullaugh , obeyed without a word . Green climbed in beside him . The pistolwaving Jacobs got into the back seat . <P> <P> Then there were sudden complications . McCullaugh 's son-in-law , 22-year-old William Hopkins , had driven up with his wife in another automobile . He ran across the pavement yelling , " What 's the matter , Pop ? " Jacobs ordered the son-in-law into the back seat . But before McCullaugh could start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One saw the pistol and screamed . <P> Jacobs began shooting . He put two bullets in Hopkins , who leaped out , cried " Please help me ! " staggered up on a nearby porch and fell dead . He shot a hole through McCullaugh 's right ear . He fired fruitlessly at the women . Green ran . Jacobs leaped out , dropped the gun and sprinted wildly down the street . The police found him only half an hour later , hiding on a nearby roof . He confessed , ratted on his pal Green and cried dramatically : " If you 've got me , give it to me . I do n't care if I burn anyhow . " The cops , who had listened to Hopkins ' sobbing wife and brokenhearted mother , set out to do their best to accommodate him .
