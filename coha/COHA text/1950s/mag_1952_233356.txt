At 10:30 one morning last week , 77-year-old Syngman Rhee called his cabinet together and prepared to spring the trap on representative government in South Korea . He told his ministers he planned to dissolve the Assembly , which opposes him , amend the constitution , and seek his re-election by direct vote of the people , whom he manipulates through a lough police force and a controlled press . Rhee 's chief crony , Lee Bum Suk , the Home Minister , supported the move . The end of Korea 's infant parliament was set for noon . ' <P> With only an hour to spare , U. S. Charge d'Afairs Allan Lightner strode in to hand <P> Rhee a note from Harry Truman . What the U.S. President told his Korean ally was not made public , but it was enough to deter Rhee . <P> In Sanctuary . But Rhee had other schemes . He ordered his 52 followers in the 183-member Assembly to boycott sessions to prevent a quorum . His police grabbed eleven anti-Rhee Assemblymen , locked them up in a dilapidated house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get 15 more anti-Rhee parliamentarians to come in for " questioning . " Scared opposition Assemblymen huddled in the sanctuary of their barnlike meeting hall , sleeping on bedrolls and benches . <P> In a Pusan courtroom , nine of Rhee 's army officers put Assemblyman Suh Min Ho on trial , accused him of murdering a South Korean army captain . Suh 's lawyer told the court-martial that his client had shot in self-defense and had been acquitted by the Assembly . Suh is not very popular with South Korean army brass since he brought to light a half-million-dollar embezzlement scandal in Rhee 's army . <P> In Hospital . Rhee 's highhanded ways stirred up protests all over . Australia , Britain and France , all of whom have troops fighting in Korea , sent stiff notes . U.S. Ambassador John Muccio , hurrying back from an interrupted U.S. vacation , spent almost two hours telling Rhee in fuller detail what was on Harry Truman 's mind . U.N . Secretary General Trygve Lie sent a note pleading for " strict adherence to constitutional and democratic processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush-hush " patient " in a U.S. Army hospital , just 400 yards from the Korean Assembly hall . There , under U.S. protection , lives John Myun Chang , recently Premier of Korea and onetime Korean representative to the U.N . Chang , U.S.-educated ( M.A. from New York 's Manhattan College , 1926 ) , is sometimes spoken of as a successor to Rhee . Ostensibly he is being treated for an old case of jaundice . <P> This week , beset on all sides , tough old Syngman Rhee proposed a deal . He said he would let the Assembly elect the next President by June 23 ( as provided in the constitution ) if the Assembly agreed to permit the popular election of future Presidents . On the surface , this offer looked good , but the suspicious Assembly-with eleven of its members still under Rhee 's arrest-wanted to take a hard look at the fine print .
