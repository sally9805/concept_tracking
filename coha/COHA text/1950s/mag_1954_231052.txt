At dawn , two white Kenya policemen climbed into a jeep and drove down the rutted trail that leads from Nyeri into the forest at the foot of Mt . Kenya . It was still dark among the camphor trees , but Policeman Ian Henderson knew that Mau Mau sentinels were watching , and he drove without headlights . <P> Deep in the forest , the jeep came to a halt and waited in darkness and silence . " The forest was full of eyes , " said Henderson afterwards . " The pulse rate was not exactly normal , " added Policeman Bernard Ruck . Presently there came a rustling , footsteps , then dark shapes . Two Mau Mau warriors loomed alongside . Henderson waved them aboard and the four drove out of the forest . <P> Waking in Nyeri 's police stockade were half a dozen British Tommy gunners and one sad-faced black man wearing a turtleneck pullover , sandals and khaki shorts . The black man was Waruhiu Itote , 32 , alias General China , one of the Mau Mau 's bloodthirstiest killers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for a commutation to life imprisonment by cooperating with the British ( TIME , March 8 ) . Huddling with the two Mau Mau warriors in the Nyeri stockade , China gave them a message to take back to their gangs : " The white elders and the elders of the forest must now meet to end the war . " <P> Cast-Iron Secrecy . By using China , once the Mau Mau 's No. 2 commander , to call on the guerrillas to surrender , the British were hoping to win with words what 6,000 regulars and 24,000 police had failed to win by war . In a letter written from his cell , China had suggested to the authorities that Mau Mau morale is wilting , that many of its " generals " could be persuaded to lay down their arms . A squad of British officers grilled the condemned man for 68 hours and concluded that he was probably speaking the truth . In cast-iron secrecy ( Kenya Governor Sir Evelyn Baring did not even tell his superiors in Whitehall ) , the death sentence was commuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chain were removed from his leg , the ball was placed in a metal money box which was handcuffed to China 's wrist , and , disguised as a policeman , he was flown to Nyeri to communicate with the Mau Mau gangs . <P> By last week China had written 26 " surrender " letters to Mau Mau chieftains , including " General Cargo , " who operates north of Nairobi , and scar-faced Dedan Kimathi , alias Field Marshal Russia . The letters were delivered by armored cars to jungle letter boxes in hollow trees and to Mau Mau couriers waiting in forest clearings . China 's plea : " Further violence will only bring greater suffering . Those who fight on now are criminal fanatics . " <P> Wildcat in the Bag . Black and white reaction was mixed . Governor Baring himself gives the plan , at best , a 50-50 chance ; Kenya 's white settlers , some of whom believe that the best way to fight the Mau Mau is to " hang the Kikuyu tribe in batches of 25 , " condemn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
