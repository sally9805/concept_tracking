The little Vietnamese official looked sadly across his desk in Hanoi 's city hall . " The poor man will stay , and the rich man will go , " he said . " I am neither , but I am a nationalist , and I therefore must go-and I have lived here all my life . " The 300-lb . French restaurateur popped an olive into his mouth : " I came to Hanoi in 1945 as a sergeant-cook . I now have $30,000 invested in my restaurant , and I 'm staying until I have to leave . " Cried the barefoot refugee in a three-room house where 23 people live : " I left my village two years ago because there was shooting every day . Now there is no place left for me to go . " The problem to the three men was common : Hanoi , their city , was in danger . " We have had many scares in the past seven years of war , " said a Vietnamese pharmacist . " But this time I think we all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The danger to Hanoi was scarcely visible . The streets were still chockablock with cyclos ( cycle taxis , 14 a ride ) . Shrimp and snail vendors crouched behind their tiny stalls clacking metal scissors-the noisy symbol of their trade . Almond-skinned girls in straw hats and pajamalike silk costumes strolled hand-in-hand to school , and at midnight there was the customary flood of drunken soldiers and giggling tarts as the taxi-dance joints closed down . <P> Yet in Hanoi there was an undertow of fear . There were more tanks , more armored cars in the streets , more Vietnamese guardsmen drilling in the Jardin Botanique . There were more bandaged soldiers in the grim De Lanessan hospital , and there were many more planes in the sky . Sometimes the French 105-mms. pounded unseen targets unusually close to the suburbs ; or an alien burst of machine-gun fire slashed across one of the two city airfields ; or a trigger-happy Senegalese sentry fired and shouted in the dark . French and Vietnamese housewives were finding everyday items much harder to get , much more expensive , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as last March , it cost $6 to truck a one-ton load 58 miles into Hanoi from Haiphong ; last week it cost $25 . One Hanoi dry-goods importer last year did $90,000 worth of business ; last week he reduced his 1954 estimate to $25,000 . The surest barometer of Hanoi 's fear : real-estate values are down some 30% since March . <P> Voices in the City . Not long ago , the Red advance would have made glad tidings for Hanoi . In 1946 perhaps 80% of Hanoi 's 140,000 people were for the Communists , and the French had to fight to secure themselves when the war began there . Last week Vietnamese authorities estimated that the city 's population was up to 340,000 and that Communist sup port was down to about 30% . From Communist-held areas , thousands of ref- ugees who could not stomach Red taxation , conscription and forced labor crowded the city .
