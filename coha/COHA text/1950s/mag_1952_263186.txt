In Boston 's Bradford Hotel last week , some 14,500 people milled through a maze of cages , inspecting hundreds of fluffy little animals with faces like rabbits and tails like anemic squirrels . The animals were chinchillas ; the occasion was the Eastern show of the National Chinchilla Breeders of America , a sort of Westmin ster Kennel Club for rodents and the trade association for one of the strangest businesses in the world . <P> Last year the nation 's 8,600 U.S. chinchilla breeders did a total business of $10 million , selling live animals to each other and to newcomers in the game . Prices are high , ranging up to $1,500 a pair , and profits are good . But nobody will really know for another five years whether the animals are actually worth anything at all . <P> The First Eleven . Once chinchilla was a prized fur , adorning the robes of kings and potentates . Annual world sales were as high as 78,000 skins in 1900 . But gradually the mountains of South America , where the chinchilla lived , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion . In 1923 , an Anaconda mining engineer named Mathias Chapman captured eleven of the remaining wild chinchillas , brought them from the Andes to Southern California in an ice-cooled crate . He started breeding them and founded the domestic chinchilla industry . From his original eleven animals sprang virtually all the estimated 250,000 chinchillas in the U.S. today . <P> Since raising chinchillas is almost as easy as keeping canaries , the fad caught on fast in Southern California . The animals can be fed for $3 a year ( mostly on hay and vitamin-enforced pellets ) , and females will bear three to 15 young a year . <P> One of California 's biggest breeders is Los Angeles ' Eugene J. Donovan , 47 , a burly ex-Seabee who planned to go into mink farming after the war , then shifted to chinchillas in 1948 because he knew " there was a lot of green stuff in it . " Starting with two pairs of animals , he built up his herd to 1,500 in two years by buying and breeding . He put up an $8,000 laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television show to plug sales of breeding pairs , and waited for the green stuff to come in . Last year , says Donovan , it came in to the extent of $325,000 , for a net of $97,000.
