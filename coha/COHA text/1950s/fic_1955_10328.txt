" Thanks , Wally . " " He was a wonderful guy . " " Yes . Goodbye , Wally . " Honking , the cortege started , and moved down the road . The public-ad. dress horn over the camp office blared , " Breakfast now being served in the main dining room . " The crowd on the lawn was already melting , straggling to the doors of the dining hall . It occurred to Marjorie that she was very hungry ; but it was too late to do anything about it . Looking through the rear window , she saw Wally and Noel standing side by side on the porch of the camp office , watching the procession depart . The cars bumped slowly along the rough muddy camp road , splashing brown water high in the air ; then they went out through the entrance arch , and glided down the main highway . Marjorie looked back at the glinting coppery image of Lady South Wind atop the arch , remembering the elation and triumph with which she had passed under it in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A lot different coming out than going in , hey ? " Mrs. Morgenstern , twisted round in the front seat , was regarding her daughter wryly . " Yes , Mom . A lot different . " " Well , it 's still more different for the Uncle . " " I know . " After a silence Mrs. Morgenstern said , " Tell the truth , Marjorie . It ' Sodom , is n't it ? " Marjorie hesitated . Then she said , " Oh , more or less , Mom , more or less , I suppose it is . Now you tell me this . Why is it so beautiful ? " The mother grimaced . " That 's an old question . " She faced the front . The cortege rolled smoothly down the highway to New York . Only many hours later  --  when the funeral was over , and the cars were leavingthe cemetery on Long Island where the Uncle had been lowered into the brown earth  --  did the thought at last strike Marjorie , through all the fog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped her from having an affair with Noel Airman ; and that nothing else in the world could have stopped it.  |p201Not  many girls get an offer of a star part in a Broadway production the day after they graduate from college ; but Marjorie Morgenstern did . Just before the commencement exercises began  --  when she was joking and skylarking with the other senior girls in a dressing room at Carnegie Hall , putting on her cap and gown  --  the dramatic coach , Miss Kimble , came dartingin all red-eyed and red-nosed . She pressed on the bewildered Marjorie a damp kiss , a hug redolent of pine soap , and a letter to the Broadway producer , Guy Flamm . " It 's no open sesame to the pearly gates , Lord knows . But believe me , dear , any contact is important when you 're starting on Broadway . You 're on your way to a glorious destiny . I know it . Give my love to Guy , and God bless you . " With this , and another kiss , and another pine-scented hug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the strains of Pomp and Circumstanceplayed loudly but uncertainly by the college orchestra , Marjorie stared straight ahead , face rigid , shoulders thrown back , seeing nothing but the bunched red curls of Agnes Monahan in front of her ; and , out of the corner of her eye , a stretch of blurred staring faces , and hands holding white programs . The rented coarse black gown she was wearing gave out a musty smell , as though it had been lying long disused in a loft . She was extremely conscious of the black square cap on her head and the tassel dangling near her eye . In the dressing room she had joked with the other girls about the absurdity of the costume and the hollowness of this commencement in a hired hall , with its sad farewell to ivy-covered subways and hallowed carbon monoxide . But as she marched down the aisle her eyes misted , and she forgot for the moment that she had been despising her schoolwork for years , and that she had hated Hunter because it was n't Cornell or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret and excited anticipation . She had read Guy Flamm 's name often in the theatre columns ; he was n't one of the famous producers , but a producer he most certainly was . The unexpectedletter from Miss Kimble in her pocket meant more to her than the diploma she was about to receive . It was the real accolade for whatever shep202had done at school ; more than any diploma , it might light the way to the future . She was wondering , too , whether Noel was in the audience , and , if so , how she would manage matters after the ceremony . Her mother , she knew , would inevitably want to go to Schrafft 's ; and Noel , who could eat with pleasure in the noisiest , dirtiest cafeterias , had once said that the middle-class miasma at Schrafft 's gave him the black horrors . After some remarkably uninteresting speeches , the roll call of the graduates began . Rank on rank , seven hundred girls marched to the stage , and as their names were called , they each received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lavender ribbon . It went as regularly and swiftly as bottle-capping . Little lonely handclaps rose here and there in the hall for each girl . Only the prize winners and a few expert politicians in the class evoked any real applause . Marjorie tensed as her turn drew near , and her regret became acute at not having worked hard enough to lift herself out of this black line of nobodies . " Felice Mendelsohn ... " " Agnes Monahan . . . " " Marjorie Morgenstern ... " A bit dizzily , she walked across the open space to the dean . To her amazementthere was a general outbreak of handclaps . She glanced to her left at the banks of faces . Even some of her classmates were applauding . The dean 's eyes relaxed from a formal grinning glitter to friendliness ; her hand was hot , moist , and strong . " Good luck , Eliza . " It was over . Marjorie Morgenstern , bachelor of science , was leaving the huge stage of Carnegie Hall with a diplomain her hand . " Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolan ... " Evidently her production of Pygmalion in November  --  she had organizedand staged it herself , after the dramatic club had rejected the idea as too ambitious  --  had won her a trace of distinction , after all . She wept a few minutes later , as did many girls about her , when the graduating class closed the ceremony with the alma mater hymn : Fame throughout the wide world is the wish Of every Hunter daughter true .. . She had always considered it a silly song  --  " fame throughout the wide world " indeed , for this sad crop of subway riders !  --  and it seemed silly now , too . But it was the end , and so she wept . The lobby , jammed and steamy , was pervaded by the smell of rain and wet overcoats . Marjorie shouldered her way through , clutching the diploma , went outside , and saw her parents at the outer edge of the crowd under the marquee , talking to Noel . It was raining very hard , slantwise ; the wind on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hugged them , then briefly clasped Noel 's hand . " Quite an ovation you got , " he said . He wore an old brown hat with a shapeless brim , and a brown herringbone topcoatslightly frayed at one elbow . Fists jammed in his pockets , shoulders stooped , a vague smile on his face , he looked ill at ease and almost seedy . His white lean face fully showed his thirty years.  | " That was probably you and my folks , " she said , " clapping hard enough to raise echoes . " All at once arms were flung around her , and her face was momentarily buried in wet gray squirrel fur . " Sugar bun , congratulations ! Welcome to freedom ! " " Marsha ! Hello --  " " Honey , you do n't mind , do you ? " Marsha 's face had the old eager look , but she seemed to be much thinner . " Saw the commencement announced in the Times this morning , had to beg out of the corset department long enough to see la Morningstar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the class  --  gargoyles , my dear , where does Hunter collect them ? " She turned to the parents . " Look at your folks , will you ? How do they manage to get younger and younger ? " She glanced roguishly at Noel . " And if it is n't the great Mr. Airman ! " " Hello , Marsha , " Noel said with a smile , his tone faintly weary . Marsha said , linking her arm with Marjorie 's , " Did you hear that claque in the balcony when they called your name ? That was me . I damn near split my gloves getting it started --  " The wind veered and spattered cold rain over them . Mrs. Morgenstern said , wiping her face , " Well , it 's silly to stand here in the wet . Schrafft 's is just a few doors down --  " Marjorie was troubled by Noel 's demeanor in the restaurant . He slumped very low in his chair , smoking , and glancing around at the brown-panelled walls and the parties of middle-aged women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Automatically , not watching his fingers , he was tearing apart the paper doily at his place . Marsha kept chattering about the graduates . When the waitress came the parents ordered ice cream and the girls cocktails . Noel scanned the menu with drooping eyes . " I 'll have a cottage cheese and Bartlett pear salad with watercress . " Marjorie peered at him . " Good heavens , you never eat such junk . Have a drink . " " It 's a penance . This is like going up a holy staircase on my knees , " Noel said . " I may as well do it all the way . " Marsha 's eyes gleamed at Marjorie . " What have you done to him ? He 's a broken man . " " Broken , " Noel said . " Saddled , bridled , bitted , and tamed . Children ride me in Central Park for a dime . " The parents smiled uncomfortably . Mrs. Morgenstern said , " Listen , do n't complain , Noel . That 's steady work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgenstern , how would you like to see me make twenty-five thousand a year ? " " I think Marjorie might like it , " the mother said . " Would you ? " Noel said to Marjorie . " Look , Noel , what do I care ? Do whatever you think will make you happy . " It was an impossible situation , Marjorie thought , especially with Marsha grinningly absorbing every word . Talk started up of what Marjorie was going to do with herself now . Mrs.p204Morgenstern said she ought to go to work as a secretary in the father 's office . " Just to find out what it feels like to make a dollar , " she said . " The whole world looks different once you 've made a dollar . " " That 's absolutely true , " Marsha said . Marjorie turned on her . " You , of all people ! " Marsha , tossing her head , took a cigarette and a silver lighter from her purse . " Honey , if the Theatre Guild is holding a part open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicked a flame to the end of the cigarette . Marjorie had an impulse to drop the Guy Flamm bombshell into the discussion . But she suppressed it ; time enough to talk about that when she knew what the outcome would be . Marsha went on , " I 've always believed in you , and I still do . But it 's just true , you 're only half alive , you 're only a child , really , until you 've earned money . You might as well pile up a reserve for the pavementpoundingnext fall . And find out , incidentally , how most of the world lives . It 's a big gap in your education . " " On that theory , " Noel said , " she also should go out and get an arm torn off in the subway or something . One way or another , most of the world lives maimed . " " What kind of talk is that ? " the father said with unusual harshness , and there was silence until the waitress returned . Marsha lifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the star about to dawn on the world . " Noel lifted a forkful of cottage cheese toward Marjorie and ate it . Mr. Morgenstern pushed his ice cream aside after a few spoonfuls . " You 'll excuse me , people . We 'll celebrate a little better tonight at dinner . The office is in a bad mess . " Noel stretched out a long arm , seized the check from the waitress , and put on his dingy hat and coat . " Well , rising star , talk to you tonight . I have to go , too . Have to see about that twenty-five thousand a year . " Mrs. Morgenstern chatted for a while with the girls , questioning Marsha about her department store job with more kindliness than she had shown in the old days . When she left , the two girls glanced at each other and burst out laughing . " How about another drink ? " Marsha said . " Why not ? I have no homework tomorrow . " Marsha caught the waitress ' attention , and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sublime feeling , is n't it ? " " Marsha , how much weight have you lost , forty pounds ? You look splendid . " Marsha simpered and put her hand to her hair , which was cropped , thinned , and curled close to the head . The thick paint and purple lipstick were gone ; she wore only a little light makeup . The loss of weight had brought the outlines of bones into her face . Her frame was still bulky , but the black suit and plain white silk shirtwaist made it less noticeable . Gone , too , were the gaudy earrings . Her one ornament was a large curious gold crab pinned to a shoulder . Marsha said , obviously enjoying Marjorie 's scrutiny , " Oh well , dear , I 've done as well as I can by the old hulk , I guess . Lamm 's has been an education ,  |p205it  beats Hunter seven ways . I 'm not assistant corset buyer yet , so I suppose I should n't have gotten in touch with you , but --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very glad you came . " hiy " Well , honey , you know you regarded me more or less as a leper not even two years ago . Maybe after a summer at South Wind you feel a little kindlier toward me . At least you 'll agree I did n't invent sex . " " I was kind of young , you know , Marsha . " " Oh , darling , I wish to God you 'd been right , instead of just young . It 's a nasty pigsty of a world , and that 's the truth . But I broke with Carlos way back when I went to work , in case you 're interested  --  and I 've been a good girl ever since , honestly . Not through choice , I wo n't claim that much saintliness . I 've had no chances worth speaking of . But the hell with all that . Bless Ili you , you little devil , you 've harpooned Moby Dick ! Who would have thought it ? Noel Airman , brought low by little Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you remember , I told you you could probably do it .  --  Well , do n't sit there with a face like a boiled lobster , tell me everything . " " I have n't harpooned him , do n't be absurd . " Marjorie drank to cover her delighted confusion . " Oh , please , baby . I never saw a man so thoroughly and hopelessly gaffed . How did you do it ? What 's your secret ? Spare no details . " " Oh , Marsha , it 's awful . I 'm in terrible trouble , if you want to know . " " Poor baby . Are you pregnant ? It 's nothing to worry about --  " Marjorie choked over her drink , sputtered into her napkin , and coughedand coughed . It was some seconds before she could gasp hoarsely , " Ye gods , Marsha . You 'll never change , will you ? " With a hugely amused grin Marsha said , " Sorry , honey , I 've never beenable to resist shocking you . You always react like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and give me a cigarette . " Marjorie began to laugh . " No , I 'm not pregnant . As a matter of fact I think I 'll shock you now . I 'm not having an affair with Noel . " Marsha looked searchingly at her face . " I believe you . " " Well , thank you  --  " " Do n't be sarcastic , " Marsha said . " Have you any idea what a feat you 're pulling off ? Men like Noel do n't put up with your West Side brand of inconclusive mush . What 's been happening ? " Marjorie still felt her old mistrust of Marsha , but the need to unburden herself overcame it . " Well , Marsha , it 's all so weird I would n't know where to begin . " " Are you engaged ? " " Far from it . " She began to describe the summer at South Wind , and soon was pouring out the story . Marsha listened like a child , her eyes glowing , sometimes holding her cigarette unregarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Samson-Aaron she stammered and her voice became shaky . Marsha shook her head . " You poor kid . " Marjorie was silent for a little while . Then she said , " I had the strongest possible feeling that I 'd never see Noel again . I did n't want to . He wrote and I did n't answer . He phoned and I pretended not to be in. "  | " Did you go out West ? " " No . Mom took me to one of those hotels in the mountains where you meet nice young men . She never said she was against Noel . She has n't , to this day . Well , I met nice young men , hordes of them . Doctors and lawyers with mustaches , half of them . They come out in force in the mountains in August , like goldenrod . I was the belle of the place , if I do say so . The other mamas would gladly have poisoned my noodle soup if they 'd dared . Well , when I came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all sounds pretty boastful , does n't it ? " " Darling , we 're old friends , " Marsha said . " Curse your pretty face , I know every word of it 's true . " " All I 'm getting at is , I was twice as bored as if I 'd been a wallflower . All those fellows seemed so dreary , after Noel ! Marsha , I hold no brief for him , but he 's  --  well , you know , he 's somebody --  " " Somebody ? You may as well know it , kid , Noel Airman is the end of the trail . I hope you marry him  --  of course you will , for better or worse , otherwisehe 'll haunt you to your grave . They do n't come like Noel . Men , that is . " " Now we come to the strange part . It 's a little hard to talk about . " She looked away from Marsha 's inquisitive eyes , out into the street . The table was near the window . Rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement . Since her infancy she had loved to watch those little leapingstars . " It 's a cloudburst , do you know ? Happy day , Marjorie graduates  --  I think I might have refused to see him when he finally did phone again , Marsha , late in September , if not for all those dull dates . But it was such a blessed relief to hear his voice , an intelligent voice . He sounds intelligent , you know . So  --  I did it , I said all right , I 'd meet him for a drink . We went on to dinner , naturally . And there were more dates , and  --  I do n't know , I hate getting clinical about these things --  " Marsha said , " Dear , I 'm an old woman . " Looking out at the dancing gray bubbles on the sidewalk , Marjorie said , " I did n't enjoy kissing him any more . Or  --  or any of that , you know . It was like kissing Wally . That was five months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . That 's the gist of it . In every other way I still admire him and like him , in fact he fascinates me , I guess , but  --  the romancing , shall we say , just does n't work any more . " " Not at all ? " Marsha said , staring . " Never ? " " Well , to be honest  --  confession is good for the soul and so forth  --  a couple of times , when I 've had a few drinks , there 's been a sort of glimmering . But so feeble , compared to what it used to be , that he just gets disgusted and quits . I do n't fight , you see , or anything . I just do n't care . " " No response , " Marsha said . " Exactly . No response . " Marjorie laughed self-consciously . " Could anythingbe queerer ? " " And how does he feel about you ? Or say he feels ? " " Oh , him . Exactly as always or more so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient and kind . He talks about it a lot , of course . " Marsha 's lips curved . " What 's his theory , dear ? "  | " Oh , very complicated . I 'm a horrible emotional mess  --  Judaism , and sex guilt , and father-love , and mother-hate , and a desire to torture Seth , and all that , all tangled up in the background . What it all boils down to is that I still love him madly , but my uncle 's death was a horrible shock and brought out the guilt feelings and all the complications , and I 've got a bad case of emotional paralysis or amnesia . There 's some name for it . He says the books are full of it , it 's the commonest thing in the world , and I 'll get over it . He 's just going to wait it out . " " And then what ? Marry you ? " Marjorie hesitated . " No , not necessarily . " " What , then ? " " Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in love the way we are , it 's too precious to be ignored or wasted  --  and so forth , and so on . " Marsha lit a cigarette from a burning butt . " He has n't written any new songs lately , has he ? " " He 's done nothing since he left South Wind . Or virtually nothing . It 's absolutely incredible how lazy he can be , Marsha . It worries me . He 'll sleep eighteen hours at a stretch . He 'll go to one of these chess clubs and just play chess day after day . He 's a whiz . Then again he can do a staggering amount of work , staggering , in no time at all . During Christmas week , a producer named Alfred Kogel said he 'd take an option on Noel 's musical comedy if he 'd make certain changes . Well , in nine days Noel wrote a whole new show . So help me . Including a lot of new music , beautiful music . I mean , it 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but he improved it terrifically . I 'm sure it 'll be produced some day , and it 'll make Noel . It 's brilliant . But it 's off the beaten track in every way , and --  " " What happened with Kogel ? He 's a damn good producer . " " It was heart-rending . Noel came to his office with the revised script , and found out Kogel had nearly died of a heart attack on New Year 's Eve , and has to stay in a sanatorium for a year . So , back he went to sleeping and chess . That 's what he 's still doing . " Marsha shook her head . " Well , I can understand that . Nasty blow . " She sipped her cocktail , then stirred it for a long time , with her eyes on the moving stick . " But never fear , Golden Boy will recover . You ca n't down a man like that . There are other producers , and he 'll write other shows . As for this emotional numbness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to wear off . It 's the luckiest thing that could have happened , in a way . You 've challenged the man to his soul . The one thing Noel does with both arms tied behind him is arouse women . He 'll wake you up again , or die trying . Male vanity . You 've got him , baby . I foresee nothing but a happy ending for both of you . Orange blossoms , fame , fortune , and a huge house with a swimming pool in Beverly Hills . " Marjorie could n't help smiling at Marsha 's unchanging glibness . " And what 's been happening with you , Marsha ? Good Lord , you just let me talk on and on about myself . " " Honey , you 're the interesting one . What can happen to me ? I 'd love to  |p208meet  a guy . I 've done everything I can , you see  --  starved myself to death for a year , and so forth --  " " You look stunning now . " With a wry smile Marsha said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , the old exotic effect . Russian intelligentsia 's idea of high fashion . Gawd . By the way , she has a fur coat now . A beautiful Persian lamb . She really looks grand in it . When she flounces into Town Hall in that coat , you 'd swear she was Wanda Landowska . I bought my father some decent clothes , too --  " Marjorie 's eyes wandered to the damp squirrel coat on the rack by the table , which Marsha had worn years ago to The Mikado rehearsals . Marsha followed her look and quickly said , " Hell , what 's a coat ? Something to wear in the cold and the wet . It 's just that my mom had built up this fur-coat idea in her mind . Wanted one for ten years , ever since her old one fell to rags . But what with my dad 's brilliant operations in the Street --  Do n't you worry , kid , I 'll have a mink one of these days , and so will Mama , but first things first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've bought everything on time , and heaven knows I 'm in hock up to my eyebrows , but I 'm a fanatic on prompt payments , baby . You would n't know me . I think it was the money that split you and me , as much as anything . I never forgot it . " " Oh , Marsha , I swear I never thought about it --  " " You thought plenty . " Marsha drank . " My folks talk about you all the time , you know . And I  --  well , I 've never stopped thinking about you . You 're one of the household gods . You just flashed through , like a rocket on the way up  --  you see , you 're so pretty , and fortunate , and so damned respectable . My folks have wanted to be respectable since they got off the boat , and they 've never made it . Until now . But they 're respectable , kid , you would n't know them . Petty bourgeois , pure and simple , sitting in the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida in another year or two , I 'll see to that . They 've never had much . But at least they 've got me , by God , now that I 'm a big girl . " Marjorie said in a subdued tone , " You 're worth ten of me , Marsha . I 'm still a burden to my parents . " " Oh , Prince Charming will relieve them pretty soon . Or if not , you 'll be raking in the dough on Broadway . That little red carpet is going to go right on unrolling in front of you , sweetie . " She laughed . " I 'll give you one teeny bit of advice , though . If you promise not to sock me . " " Go ahead . " " Well , it 's nothing much . Just this  --  if Noel ever does corner you in that Bank Street love nest of his one evening , with a mad gleam in his eye , do n't bite and scratch too hard or too long , will you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't look so cross-eyed at me . What do you think it is , a fate worse than death ? Take a poll among your graduating class ten years from now , sugar bun , about their marriages , and find out how many of them clinched the deal by giving out a few free samples  --  if you can get them to tell the truth --  Okay , here I go again , the corrupter of youth . Welladay . Pay no attention to me. "  | " I do n't , " Marjorie said . " I never did , really , and I never will . " She shook her head , smiling . " Stick to your ideas , sweetheart , " Marsha said , putting on her coat . " Lord knows mine have got me exactly nowhere , though I do n't think they 're the reason . We 'll compare notes when we 're old and gray and see who came nearer the mark . " As they walked to the front of the restaurant she added , " But let 's not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fun . " The change from stagnant steam-heated air to cold wet wind made Marjorie sneeze . They hesitated outside the door , shrinking from the rain , buttoning their coats . Marsha said , " Me for the bus . You ? " " Oh , it 's graduation day . I 'll take a cab . " Marsha looked into her eyes . " Do you have fun , Margie ? Do you have many friends ? " " Not to speak of . Noel , mostly . You know how that is . " " Sure . " Marsha held out her hand . " We had some wonderful times , did n't we ? This was like the old days . Happy graduation , Marjorie Morningstar . " Marsha ran off into the rain toward the bus stop . It was the old clumsy run ; hips swaying , heels kicking outward . Marjorie kept waiting for Noel to telephone all evening . She tried to seem gay and grateful during the elaborate dinner her mother had prepared to celebrate her graduation , but her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your ear is going to fall off , Margie . " " Eh ? " " The one that 's stretching toward the telephone . " The parents guffawed , and she turned a little red . Seth sat imperturbably enjoying the success of his joke . He was fifteen , six feet tall , with huge danglingbony hands , and an absurdly smooth childish face topping his lanky frame . He was president of his class , his marks were good , and he held a number of school honors and posts . He was enormously favored by **27;8708;TOOLONG girls , painted children wobbling on high heels in toomaturedresses . It was hard for Marjorie to realize that they were the same age she had been at the start of the great dim George era . Marjorie was not much annoyed by Seth 's gibe . Noel was an old story by now in the family ; the time of surreptitious dates in the Forty-second Street library was long past . It had ended abruptly one night in October when she had said , for the third time in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the library again , " and her mother had answered , " Look , call up that book and tell him to come here for a change . I like him . " Mrs. Morgenstern was unfailinglycordial to Noel , though the father was inclined to short formal growls with him . Noel avoided coming to the Morgenstern apartment as much as he could . He said it was nobody 's fault , but he felt trapped there . Mr. Morgenstern said , rubbing his eyes , " It seems to me we ought to do something tonight . Go to a show  --  "  | " Thanks , Papa , but I think maybe I 'll turn in , " Marjorie said . " Get up bright and early to face the cruel world . " " Are you really going to look for an acting job ? " the mother said . " I 'm going to get one . " Mrs. Morgenstern said , " Well , to me it 's like fishing for nickels in subway gratings . A crazy way to make a living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . Listen , it 's your life . Good luck to you . " Mr. Morgenstern said through an immense yawn , " She was fine in that school play . Maybe she 'll surprise us all . " Marjorie was lounging in a housecoat on her bed , reading a lending-library novel , when there was a tap at her door . " Are you dressed ? " " Come in . " Seth wore a loud gray tweed overcoat with the collar turned up , and a new red-and-yellow tie . His blond hair gleamed wetly . " Well , I just wanted to say congratulations and all that , from me to you personally . " " Thanks , Seth . " " Sorry I missed the commencement . I 'd have liked to see you in a cap and gown . Bet you looked silly . " " Idiotic . " " How does it feel , Marge ? To be out of school , all finished and done with it ? " Marjorie paused . " Well , it 's a great relief . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be scared . I do n't want to finish school . " " You 'll change your mind about that . Of course right now you love it . You 're king of the school . And all your little dates seem so precious and fascinating --  " " Oh well , so far as that goes --  " Looking at his moving shoe , he said , " Not that you 're any great shakes , but I 've never come across a girl anywhere near you . Shows you how sad the female half of the human race is . " Marjorie went to him and kissed his cheek . It still felt queer to look up to her towering baby brother . " Thanks , despite the reservations . " Briefly , and with astonishing rough force , he hugged her , and let her go . " Margie , all the luck in the world . I think  --  well , hell  --  I 'm sorry I kidded you about Noel  --  he 's all right , I guess . " Seth went out in a stumbling tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office was in a narrow old building in the West Forties , between two theatres . It was a thrill just to read his name on the grimy directory board . Once again she felt in her purse for the letter ; then she ran for the elevator , hands perspiring and stomach fluttery . She opened the glass door marked in gold leaf Guy Flamm Enterprises with a feeling of stepping into the future . A fat girl with greasy hair and thick greenish glasses sat inside , boxed between an old switchboard , an older filing cabinet , and a card table piled high with scripts bound in many colors . " Yes ? " she said in an offended tone , sipping coffee from a paper cup , and biting a semicircle out of a bun . " I 'd like to see Mr. Flamm. "  | " What about ? " " An acting job . " " I beg your pardon ? " The girl chewed the bun for a few seconds . " He 's not casting . " " I have an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Marjorie Morningstar . " " Wait . " The girl announced the name into the switchboard , and after a pause repeated , " Wait . " She resumed reading a script in her lap , peering and frowning through the greenish glasses . Marjorie stood awkwardly in the middle of the little anteroom , uncomfortablywarm in her beaver coat , but unwilling to take it off . Half of the effect of the new red dress lay in unveiling it ; she wanted Guy Flamm to see that effect . There was a chair behind her heaped with scripts . " Miss , do you mind if I use this chair ? " " Yes . " " Eh ? " " Do n't use it . I 've got those scripts in a certain order . " So Marjorie stood there in silence . It was eerie to be in a space the size of two telephone booths with another human being and not to exchange a word . She kept shifting from foot to foot . Ten minutes drifted by . Marjorie was working up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on in , " the girl said , jerking her thumb over her shoulder . The first noticeable feature of Guy Flamm was a pair of popping eyes , one of which was red and streaming . He held a handkerchief to it . He stood up behind his desk , a red-faced little man with thick well-groomed white hair , a trim white mustache , a tan tweed jacket , a shirt with faint green lines in it , and a green bow tie . " Come in , come in , my dear . " He gestured at a chair . Marjorie could n't help wondering what he had been doing while she had waited . The office was absolutely empty except for a desk , two chairs , and Guy Flamm . No telephone calls had gone through the switchboard . There was nothing on the desk but an ashtray containing two dead cigars and some ashes . On a shelf over Flamm 's head was a row of play volumes which looked as though they had been undisturbed for some years . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you 're going to set Broadwayon fire . Sit down , sit down . " Marjorie took the letter out of her purse and handed it to him . " Miss Kimble 's been awfully sweet to me . " " Wonderful girl , Dora . Never cut out for show business , but --  " Mr. Flamm glanced at the letter , mopping his bad eye . " You 've done Eliza in Pygmalion , eh ? Quite a challenge . Staged it yourself ! Interesting . " He looked at her kindly . " That 's a very pretty coat . Not many young actresses can afford a coat like that . Are n't you hot in it , though ? " Marjorie nodded and took off the coat . Since Mr. Flamm 's eyes popped anyway , she could not be sure of the impact of the red dress . She thoughtp212the eyes popped a bit more . " Marjorie Morningstar , eh ? Very euphonious . Is that your real name , dear ? " " No . It 's Morgenstern . " " Ah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded and mopped his eyes . " My first wife was Jewish . Lovely person . Where do you live ? " Marjorie told him . " Ah . With your parents ? " " Yes . " " What does your father do ? " " He 's an importer . " Puzzlement crept into her tone . Flamm smiled . " There 's method in my madness , dear . I 'm watching everything you do and say . You 'd be surprised how you 've characterized yourself already . " He fell silent , staring at her . " Interesting . " He reached to the shelf , took down a book , blew the dust off it , and held it out to Marjorie . " Are you a trouper ? Right now , let 's hear Julie Cavendish 's big speech in The Royal Family . " Startled , Marjorie said , " Give me a couple of minutes . " " All the time you want . " Flamm smoked and mopped his eye . She read over the scene ; stood , book in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flamm 's eyes seemed to bulge further , and he stopped mopping . He began to nod , slowly at first , then more emphatically . When she sat , trembling , he nodded for a long time , his eyes on her . " My dear , this is a little too good to be true . Girls just do n't walk out of college and read lines like that . " He stood and turned his back to her , looking out of the window at a brick wall . He whirled , smiling . " Look , I 'm sorry , I should be more self-controlled , at my age . It 's a one-in-a-billion shot . I 've been looking for a Clarice for eight months , and you 've walked into my office , straight from Hunter and poor little old Dora Kimble . It 's incredible , but --  " He yanked open his top drawer and flung a script bound in red on his desk . " If you can read Clarice the way you read Julie . . . Mind , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second act . I 've had every girl in town read Clarice -- What 's the matter , dear ? " Marjorie was gasping , holding her hand over her pounding chest . " Mr. Flamm  --  is there a part  --  a chance for a part ? " He thrust the script into her hands . " I do n't want to be cruel and say there 's even a chance . Read the play , that 's all . " His voice was shaking a little . " This is the theatre , so anything can happen , even a break like this . But I 'm promising nothing . You may be terrible as Clarice . Now this play , remember , is n't Shaw . Forget about your college dramatics , dear . This is Broadway , and this play is money , plain old commercial money . How quick a study are you ? Are you willing to come back tomorrow and risk a reading ? All or nothing , your one chance at Clarice ? Tomorrow at this time ? " " Yes , yes ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She stumbled out of the dank building into the sunshine with the script under her arm . The feeling of , unreality was as strong as it had been on the  |p213night  of her uncle 's death ; but this was a dream as sweet and beautiful as that had been horrible . She tried to read the first page on the sidewalk , but sunlight glaring on the white paper blinded her . She ran to a sandwich shop across the street , ordered coffee and cake , and began to read the play . The pages looked pink after the sun glare . It was hard to concentrate at first , there was so much excitement in holding a professionally typed and bound script , with its character names in upper-case letters . ( JOHN walks in . HE is a young man of thirty , dressed for tennis . HE crosses to the mirror , L. ) The cover of the script was a peculiarly tough rippled paper , bright scarlet , bound to the pages with brass fasteners . The title of the play was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . She could not get her mind calmed . Bolting her coffee and cake , and lighting a cigarette , she read on . She had read perhaps forty pages when she began to suspect that the fault might not lie in her agitation . The play seemed to be unspeakably stupid trash . The dialogue was silly , the characters vague , the action feebly meandering . She forced herself to read on , trying desperately to concentrate . The further she read , the worse it got . After a while she decided that it was simply not possible to read Down Two Doubled . It was worse than a legal document . She flipped the pages until she came to a stage direction reading ( Enter CLARICE . SHE is a beautiful dark-haired girl aged 18 . AMANDA and TONY jump up from the couch in amazement at HER appearance ) . Clarice was as nebulous as the other characters . Her lines were weak facetiousechoes of a style of college slang ten years outmoded . The play was about two young couples , rival tournament bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get at each other 's bidding signals . Clarice was the younger sister of one of the wives . She came from college for the weekend , exposed the intrigues , and outplayed all the experts in a bridge game on stage . This was as much as Marjorie could extract from the tangled fog of words called Down Two Doubled . The disappointment was sickening . Had Guy Flamm decayed into a harmlessold lunatic ? Yet she had seen his name in the Times theatre gossip quite recently . Had he written this gibberish himself ? Or was her judgment so worthless , so warped by collegiate idealism , that she could n't perceive the possibilities in a commercial script ? She had a frantic impulse to telephone Noel ; he could read this play in half an hour , and give her an unerring estimate . She went to the phone booth , dropped in the nickel , and then balked . Her dear wish was to surprise him , knock him over , with the news that she had a part in a Broadway play . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter College , and called Miss Kimble . The music teacher became almost hysterical when Marjorie said Flamm had given her a script . Marjorie interrupted the foam of congratulations . " I 'd like to see you about it , right away , if I can . " Miss Kimble fluttered and stammered about all the work she had to do , and finally told Marjorie to come at once by all means ; she would put everything else aside even if it meant losing her job.  |p214It  was queer to arrive at the college at eleven-thirty in the morning . Miss Kimble fell on Marjorie 's neck , and kissed her , and blew her nose , and looked red-eyed , and locked her door . She stared at the script with frightening eagerness . " Is that  --  is that it ? " " I 'd like you to read it . Not necessarily all of it . One act ought to be enough , Miss Kimble . But right away --  " " Of course I will , Marjorie . I 'm at your service , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . And call me Dora , for heaven 's sake , everybody in the theatre does . " Her fingers worked toward the script . Marjoriehastily handed it to her . " Down Two Doubled . Exciting title . Oh , myl Is n't Guy a dear ? And he 's brilliant --  " " Miss  --  Dora , suppose I take a walk or something ? I 've got to have your opinion . Suppose I come back in an hour ? " " Perfect . Perfect . Run along , dear . " Eyes agleam , Miss Kimble was already immersed in the play . When Marjorie returned , having smoked so many cigarettes and drunk so much drugstore coffee that she was shaking , she found Miss Kimble less excited . " Sit down , dear , " the teacher said , pursing her lips and smoothing her brown tweed skirt . The script lay closed on her desk . " How much did you read  --  Dora ? " " I finished it . " " What do you think ? " " Well  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your honest opinion ? " " Marjorie , Guy Flamm is an awfully shrewd man . He 's been in the theatre a long time . If he likes a script it must have values --  " " But did you like it ? " " Well , frankly , it 's slightly confusing at a first reading , and of course I just raced through it . " " Dora , is n't it utter and hopeless garbage ? " The music teacher looked offended . " Marjorie , the first thing you 'll have to learn in the theatre is not to make snap judgments . It 's a commercial comedy . That kind of script is full of hidden values , very often . Look at Abie 's Irish Rose . You ca n't see them , and I ca n't see them , but Guy Flamm sees them . Tell me , did he remember me at all ? " " Oh yes . Spoke very highly of you . " The music teacher blushed and fumbled at the glasses on her desk . " We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What role is he considering you for ? " " Clarice . " " Why , that 's the best part . " " I ca n't make head or tail of it , Dora . It 's just words . She has no character . She does n't talk like a person . She 's just the result of some imbecile pecking at a typewriter for a while . I 'm sorry , Dora , that 's how it strikes me . " Miss Kimble put on her glasses , and with them her classroom authority and severity . " I think you lack a sense of proportion , possibly , a teeny bit ,  |p215Marjorie  . What did you expect ? You 've been out of college one day . Did you expect to be cast as Juliet or Candida today by the Theatre Guild ? " " No , but I --  " " Guy Flamm is offering you a chance to act . To walk out on a Broadway stage , for God 's sake ! You should go down on your knees in gratitude to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least . If he gave you just a walk-on , just two lines as a maid in a dismal flop --  " " Dora , I 'm terribly grateful to you , it is n't that --  " " You 've had the most fantastic luck I 've ever heard of . Grab it , you fool . You 're supposed to be an actress . Mahe something of Clarice , even if she is just a lot of words from a typewriter . Get out on the stage . " Marjorie took the script from the desk . " Well , you 've certainly made me feel like a worm . " Miss Kimble was upon her , hugging her , diffusing pine fragrance . " Marjorie , no . Do n't take it to heart , Or rather , do ! It was just a pep talk , but I mean it . Dear , it 's a chance , do n't you see , it 's a start . " Marjorie went home and studied the script all afternoon and all evening . She turned out her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarice'svapid lines tumbling fragmented in her mind . Flamm 's fat secretary , still drinking coffee and still chewing on a bun , greeted Marjorie next morning with an astoundingly pleasant smile , and told her to go right in . Another red script lay before Flamm on his desk . He was still mopping the eye , which looked worse . Today he wore a blue checked shirt , a blue bow tie , and a blue sports jacket . " Not a word , " he said , as Marjorie started to greet him . " Take off your coat . Forget that Marjorie Morgenstern ever lived . You 're Clarice Talley . " She sat in the chair , clutching her script . " One question . Do you think you understand the play ? " " I  --  yes , Mr. Flamm . " " Which adjective would you say best describes it  --  sentimental , romantic , raffish , brittle , gay ? " " Well  --  gay , and slightly raffish . " Flamm 's eyes bulged like a lobster 's , and he smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ script . " Act z , page 41 , " he said . " Let 's go . " It took twenty minutes to read through Clarice 's scene . Marjorie was damp with perspiration when it was over . She could not tell whether she had read the drivelling lines well or badly . She had tried to convey innocence and mischievous charm with her voice and her face . Flamm deliberately closed the script , turned his back on her , and looked out of the window . Three or four minutes went by . He whirled as he had yesterday , his whole face alight . " I 'm sorry . I should send you home , let you stew for a few days  --  here it is , between the eyes . I 'm in business , after an eight-month search . You 're Clarice ! Bless your heart . We start rehearsals a week from Monday . We open in New Haven March 15 . " Marjorie broke down and cried . He stood over her , patting her shoulder . She said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Marjorie . I feel like crying myself . " He gave her a cigarette  |p216and  she calmed . He talked a while about wonderfully exciting details : costumes , rehearsal schedules , hotel rooms in New Haven . She could hardly follow , so stunned with delight was she . She said , " Yes , yes , Mr. Flamm , " and kept nodding , thinking deliriously of how she would break the news to her parents and to Noel . Somehow , after ten minutes or so , Flamm was on the subject of his brother , a Colorado mining engineer , for whom he had countersigned a note in connection with some mining equipment . The story was extremely complicated , but the upshot of it was that he had had to pay ten thousand dollars , which his brother would unquestionably repay in six months , since his contract was with Anaconda Copper , a client more reliable than the U. S. Government . " Meantime , of course , it 's a devilish nuisance , " Flamm said . " In fact , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is the tightest it 's been in all my experience . Why , Kaufman and Hart are having trouble raising money for their new play . Had I known --  Well , we 'll just have to raise the money somehow . " He paused , and not knowing what to say , she nodded brightly . He talked some more about New Haven arrangements . Then he said , " Of course , if you know someone who has ten thousand to invest in a sure-fire comedy and who wants to see you get ahead  --  the return on a hit is a thousand cents on the dollar , you know , easily , and now that I 've got my Clarice I 've got a hit for sure --  " " Golly , Mr. Flamm , I do n't know a soul with that kind of money . Ten thousand ! I wish I did . " " Well , of course , in the theatre we usually parcel these things out  --  five thousand here , five thousand there . " She shook her head , smiling . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment this may make the difference between our going into rehearsal or not . Six months from now brother Bart will give me the money , of course . In fact , I 'll gladly secure any investor with a personal guarantee against loss , countersigned by my brother . That 's how sure I am of this play . But you see , six months from now my cast may be dispersed , you may be sick , I may be sick --  " He mopped his eye . " I 'm sorry , I wish I did know somebody  --  gosh --  " " Well , actually , the plan I 've worked out is four equal shares , twentyfivehundred each  --  do n't you think your father , for instance , I 'm sure he 's anxious to see you get launched in a part like Clarice  --  after all , an importer  --  he 'd probably never miss twenty-five hundred dollars , and then there 's the fun of watching rehearsals , and all --  " At the words " your father , " a wave of sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , she put the script on his desk . " How about a thousand dollars , then ? Surely a thousand , for an im-porter --  " " Mr. Flamm , " she said huskily , " my father hates the theatre . He doesn'tbelieve in it . My father wo n't invest in your play . I 'm sorry . It 's impossible . " He mopped his eye . The friendliness and excitement were gone from hisp217face . He said , wearily and dryly , " Well , Marjorie , as I say , you 're a talented girl , but let 's face it , you 're a complete newcomer . If I 'm to stake my reputationon launching you , it seems to me it 's not asking much of your father to how his confidence in you to the extent of five hundred or a thousand dollars . " She was blindly putting on her coat . " Goodbye , Mr. Flamm . " Her hand was on the doorknob . He said , " I mean , for five hundred or a thousand I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be yours . Well , goodbye . As I say , you have talent , though it 's raw --  " Dazed , wretched , she went home on the subway . She was lying on her bed face down , unmindful of the way she was crumpling the red dress , when the telephone rang . " Marjorie ? Hi ! " Noel 's voice had a striking lift in it . " Missed me ? How about having lunch with me at the Ritz-Carlton ? " She sat up . " The  --  the Ritz-Carlton ? Noel , you ca n't afford it  --  " " Who ca n't ? You 're talking to a **27;8737;TOOLONG man . Now hurry ! " " Hello ! " she said . " Good Lord , look at you . " The change in him was startling . He wore a new pin-stripe black suit , black shoes , a white shirt with a short pinned collar , and a gray silk tie . His hair was trimmed close , and the color in his face was remarkably fresh . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The headwaiter bowed them to a conspicuously empty table in the middle of the crowded wood-panelled room . Marjorie was very ill at ease . All the women in the room looked bitingly smart : Paris hats , tailored suits , elegant hair-dos were everywhere . She wore no hat , her hair fell loosely to her shoulders ( this had been an effort to look like Clarice ) , and the red dress was a truly horrible blunder . She had been too prostrated by the Flamm fiasco to think of changing when she left the house . The glances of the men were the usual thing , but the glances of the women , which really mattered in such a place , were disdainful and slightly amused . " I look like a streetwalker in here , " she muttered to Noel as they sat . " Hardly , " he said . " As it happens , several of the town 's most eminent streetwalkers are around us , and as you see , they look quite different . " " That headwaiter treats you like a long-lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . " " Not since I 've known you . " " That 's right . It 's been a lean stretch , too . You do n't have the price . " He laughed at her vexed look . " Gad , it 's fun to torment you . It 's true , though , that on occasion the lady 's paid . Usually some lady I 've gone broke for , first . " " Do n't you find it humiliating ? "  | " Not in the least . I sit and calculate how many Automat meals I 'm saving , by not paying the check . " " You 're a hoodlum . I hope you 're not counting on my paying this time . " " You , dear ? " " Well , what 's going on here , then ? Why the prosperous getup ? Why are you looking seventeen years old ? What 's all this about twenty-five thousand a year ? " " I went to work this morning . " " Where ? What kind of job ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . " Ah , here we are . You 'll drink to the new Noel , wo n't you ? He 's your creation , as much as anybody 's . " Marjorie picked up her glass , looking at him suspiciously . " Paramount ! Arc you serious ? " He nodded . " As a writer ? Are you going to Hollywood ? " His lips were compressed in amusement . " No , dear . You 're not losing me , do n't be tragic . Drink up . Here 's death to the old Noel , that seedy bum , and long life to the new , eh ? " She smiled , in a half-disbelieving way , and drank . Noel said , " Why are you so amazed ? I 've told you about Sam Rothmore , one time or another , have n't I ? " " The rich old man you play chess with ? " " That 's the one . Did n't I mention that he 's with Paramount ?

Practically supports the chess club I play at , and a couple of Jewish old folks ' homes in the Bronx , that kind of thing . Fine taste in painting and music , very good Mozart collection and  --  well , I 've told you about the paintings , I 'm sure . I 've spent hundreds of hours in his library with him , listening to music and playing chess , and drinking the best brandy on earth . Frankly , and this is probably not nice of me , he gets to be an awful bore after a while . I ca n't say why . I guess all lonesome people are pathetic and boring , no matter who they are .

" Noel grinned , and ran a knuckle along his upper lip . " You do n't flatter me , dear . The idea is to shift me around through the departments for training , and eventually land me in a sort of chief-of-staff capacity under him , if I work out . Sam 's been suggesting this off and on for a couple of years . I used to laugh at him . I did n't see myself as a wage slave . But I started talkingseriously about it a week or so ago . He 's sure I 'm a misguided genius , and he 's going to discover me and make me into a major executive . He says I can be making twenty-five thousand a year or more in a few years .

" " Oh , I could have gone along for a few more months . I 'd have gotten a little thin and irritable , maybe , like a hibernating bear . In Paris they make an art of this kind of living .

The white wine had an exquisite glowing clean taste . Marjorie forgot her self-consciousness , eating with great relish . Noel said , pouring wine , " Why kid ourselves , Marjorie ?

Oh , hell , there 's a case for impoverished freedom , but --  " He drank . " You know , there are some charming perquisites to this job . Where do you suppose I go From here , this afternoon ?

Noel said , busily eating , " She 's a dull creature , no doubt , in person . She'sp220on her third or fourth divorce , and I hear she 's utterly dissolute . Probably arrive drunk as a goat . " " No doubt . And you 'll probably be in bed with her before the day is out I hope you enjoy it . " He put down his knife and fork and laughed at her , his eyes brilliant .

When she walks in front of the camera to play S scene , I see nothing but her agent just off camera , blotting the new clause in the contract . She 's odious . " " Oh , sure , " Marjorie growled , but she felt better . " Well , you still have n't answered me . Why have you taken this job ? " Noel shrugged .

" Marjorie looked startled . " Billy ! " " ' Twenty-two . In his second year at law school . She 's the daughter of a big corporation lawyer , a heavyweight in the Democratic party in Brooklyn . Another Marjorie , by the way , Marjorie Sundheimer --  " " Marjorie Sundheimer ? Good Lord , Billy 's marrying her ? " " You know her , then ? " " Oh , for years at fraternity dances  --  and all that --  Well , well , Billy Erhmann and Marjorie Sundheimer . Honestly , truth is stranger than fiction . " " Marjorie , ugly girls get married , too . " " 1 never said she was ugly . " " Your tones , dear , are implying that you 'd be less surprised if Billy 'd become engaged to a red-bottomed baboon , " " That 's absurd . She 's a lovely girl . It 's just  --  well , they 're both so young . " " Sweetheart , this sets Billy up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing can stop it . What the devil , I 'm happy for him , he 's a decent egg . " " Billy 's grand . " " He dropped in with this girl unexpectedly at my apartment , the night of your graduation . That 's why I did n't call you . I could n't have been morep222depressed . They 're such children ! I 'm barely used to the idea that he shaves . She 's had her nose fixed , by the way , and she 's really quite pleasant-looking . And for such a rich girl , she 's touchingly humble . Like Billy . They 're a nice couple . I think they 're going to be happy . " " No doubt she knows all about us . " " The last thing she said at the door was , Love to Marjorie , ' in a quavering voice , after nobody 'd referred to you for two hours . I think coming below Fourteenth Street was a scary adventure for her . She kept staring around , you know , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the dust on the molding , and at me . She laughed hysterically at everything I said , induct. ing half a dozen remarks that were perfectly serious . Obviously she thought I was a highly decadent monster , like Baudelaire . I think she was looking around for hypodermic needles . I was sorry I did n't at least have a gorgeous drunken blonde to fall naked out of the closet at one point . She seemed to be waiting for something like that . " " What she was waiting for , more likely , " Marjorie said , " was for me to come out from under the bed in a transparent negligee . " Noel burst out laughing . " I swear I think that was it . " Marjorie said , " Well , what do I care ? My reputation 's gone , anyway , from associating with you . " He said with sudden earnestness , " Honestly , the uptown idea of Village life is preposterous , is n't it ? Believe me , the main charm of the Village is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find overgrown hair and dirty necks as offensive as you do . As for the celebrated Village sex life , which had Billy 's girl 's eyes popping out of her head looking for evidence  --  what is it , after all , once you 're over the college boy 's glee at finding it available ? Most of the time it 's a mean dirty chore . Unattractive people snuffling and wrestling togetherbecause they 're bored , or lonesome , or sick in the head . You say I 've lived the life of a pig . Well , it 's not true . I 've always been fastidious by any standard , I claim . But I 'll tell you this , and I do n't say it to score a point . Since the day you left South Wind , there 's been nothing like that for me . Nothing at all . " This question had been plaguing Marjorie for months . Her heart swelled to have the answer , but how like Noel to drop it casually into a conversation , as a fact of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sorry to hear that . " " Understand this , I have no more scruples or morals than before . I 've simply decided it 's the better part of self-indulgence to have love or nothing . " She could n't repress a grin . " Noel dear , I think you 're slowly but surely reverting to your origins . " He shook his head at her . " You 'll make me over , come hell or high water , wo n't you ? Or you 'll tell yourself you 're doing it , anyhow . Your voice just then had the timbre of your mother 's . Let 's get out of this oak-panelled vault . " " All right , but I must say I love it here . " " What tastes you 're acquiring ! You 'll keep your husband broke , and workingnights in his dress business . " He paid the check.  | " I 'm not marrying anybody in the dress business . " " Of course . I forgot . A doctor . A specialist . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've been all through t hat . " " Ah , you see , our relationship 's exhausted . I 'm repeating my jokes . " They walked up the side street to Fifth Avenue . It was cold and windy , but clear , and the sunshine was almost blinding . He said , " Come , walk up Fifth with me . I have to pick up Sam 's car at Sixty-third . " " Sure .  --  Ever heard of a producer named Guy Flamm ? " " Of course . The fringe of the fringe . What about him ? " She told him the story while they strolled uptown past the shopwindows , amid a scurrying crowd . He was amused and sympathetic . " You poor baby . " " Oh , I do n't much care . It did n't last long enough to mean anything . And anyway , the play was such balderdash  --  at least I thought it was . " " Of course it was . All the same , he 'll probably produce Down Two Doubled one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office with a richer or dumber father than yours . It can happen tomorrow , there are so many Clarices drifting around Broadway . The desire to be an actress , in middleclassAmerican girls of a certain IQ  --  say around 115  --  is n't even a conscious decision , Margie . It 's a tropism , an organic thing that comes out of the nature of their lives . . . . All right , all right  --  " She was gnawing her lips , scowling at him . " I thought we 'd agreed that no generalizations whatever applied to you . " " Noel , does Flamm know Down Two Doubled is rubbish ? Or does he really think it 's good ? " " Who knows ? For a career like his what you need is an infinite capacity for self-deception . " " How does he live , pay his rent ? His name gets in the theatre columns --  " " Why , dear , he 's a real producer . He probably has scratched up some money with Down Two Doubled already , small amounts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may even produce a smash some day . Those scripts you saw his girl reading were the flotsam that drifts around the producers ' offices forever , one abomination more frightful than the last . I was a playreader for a few months once . I nearly went crazy . Undoubtedly he pulled Down Two Doubled out of that rancid flood . Maybe he likes it . Maybe he 's had the author rewrite it ten times . Maybe he 's charged him for his advice . There 's no end to the follies that go on in the theatre . " She said , " I take it you 've decided I have no talent . You were still dodging the issue , last time we talked about it . " His face wrinkled . " I 'm really not sure . Anyone can see you 're bright and pretty and full of nineteenish charm . You walk on stage endowed by nature with half the effects a skilled actress has to work to create . But such incandescencedoes n't last . What you 'll be left with when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you 'll be snagged into a fine fat marriage long before that , so you 'll never really find out . One thing I 'll tell you , though . If you 're going at this seriously , you ought to get rid of that Marjorie Morningstar name . It has a fake ring . "  | " Shows how much you know . It 's in the New York phone book . " " I do n't care . You 'd be better off calling yourself Marjorie Morgan . " " That 's drab and commonplace . " " Well ? The idea of a name change is to make you more like other people , not less . " " I suppose Noel Airman is commonplace . " " I was in just about the stage you are now when I thought of that . If I had to do it over again , I 'd call myself something like Charlie Robinson . If you want to pretend you 're not a Jew , you may as well do it right . " " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with Morgenstern ? " " It 's too ordinary . " " I see . You want an unusual name , like Maggie Sullavan . " " Well , that 's different . Morgenstern sounds so . . . I do n't know --  " " So Jewish , girlie , so Jewish . Those overtones of potato pancakes , Fridaynightcandles , gefilte fish  --  that 's what you do n't like . " She said , irritated , " Of course , everybody 's motives have to be as wretched as yours . All the same , Noel , I 'm going to call myself Marjorie Morningstar , and I 'm going to become an actress , in spite of Guy Flamm , and my mother , and you , and all the odds . " He put his arm around her waist and briefly squeezed it . " That 's the old college fight . " They walked in silence for a while . He said , " But I ca n't picture it , and you know why , Margie ? Every real actress I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of iron core . When you talk to them  --  even romantically  --  you get a metallic ring in response . I 'm not putting this well . I do n't mean insincerity , d' you see , or phoniness , or frigidity . It 's  --  well , they 're more like men , in a fixity of purpose , and a hard alertness to the business at hand . Most of them make a hash of their love lives . It 's as though the price of having talent is the loss of the womanish instinct for sniffing along the right path of life . Well , you  --  you 're such a female , such a cat picking your way with dainty paws --  " " I often wonder where you get your ideas about me . Of all my graduating class , I think I should have been voted the girl most likely to hash up her life . " " You like to romanticize yourself . You 're pure cat , sniffing nervously but surely toward a house in New Rochelle , and a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go climb a tree . Lord , you 're a bore sometimes . " He laughed . They were walking along the eastern side of the plaza . The breath of the hansom-cab horses across the street smoked in the sunshine . " D' you know , you 've had an effect on me ? I respect cat wisdom . I think now I might very well enjoy that kind of life , myself  --  and buying in these shops , and staying weekends at the Pierre or the Plaza , and all that  --  always providing one thing . Providing that my wife and I both regarded such a life as a pleasant comic mask , put on like Mexican living or Fiji Island living , because at the moment it pleased us  --  but in itself unreal , empty , of nop225importance , and discardable overnight . " With a sharp turn , he pulled her into a florist 's shop . " What on earth  --  " " Violets , in February ! Did n't you see them in the window ? Must buy you a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbled a card while the florist prepared the violets . He handed the little purple nosegay and the card to her with a flourish : Violets in winter , Sweetness in iceNot that you need , dear , This wily advice . She blushed , laughed huskily , and dropped the card in the purse . " Very witty . I think I 'll carry the flowers . " Sam Rothmore 's black Cadillac stood in front of a lean gray stone house which had rococo black iron grillwork on the windows and the massive doors . The chauffeur , a neat gray-haired man in black , greeted Noel respectfully and held the door of the limousine open . " Say , come on , I 'll drop you off at home first , " Noel said . " Oh no , Noel , the car is for business . " " Nonsense . There 's all kinds of time . Get in and stop arguing . SevenfortyWest End Avenue , Philip . " " Certainly , Mr. Airman . " Rolling through Central Park in the Cadillac , Marjorie sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawns with patches of ice on the rocks , and thought that it might not be bad to die at this instant . She turned to Noel . " You 're ruining my life . I wonder if you 're doing it de-liberately . " " I 'm in love with you , " Noel said . She glanced at the chauffeur 's back , then reached up and kissed him lightly on the lips . " I 'm in love with you , too . " " One of us must crack , " Noel said . " Not me , " Marjorie said . Noel did not telephone during the next three weeks , and a very dreary three weeks they were . She spent the time exploring the theatre district , and what she found out mainly was that there were a large number of girls like her  --  droves of them , indeed  --  marching doggedly and without much hope from one producer 's office to another , through February snow and slush , under unchangingblack skies that seemed to hang a few feet above the tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to come with him to Billy Ehrmann 's engagement reception , Marjorie accepted eagerly . She was onlyp226mildly curious to see Sandy , or for that matter Billy and his bride-to-be ; but she figured that Noel would probably appear at the party . A melancholy , quenched Sandy called for her that Sunday . He seemed to be a foot or so shorter than she remembered him ; round-shouldered , listless , dull . But he said bravely that he loved working at Lamm 's , and that everything could n't be better . He confided to Marjorie that he had found a way to make a fortune . He owned twenty per cent of a race horse ; and while twenty per cent of the horse 's weekly hay consumption cost him most of his salary , he had high hopes of making a killing soon in one of the big stake races . The ballroom at the Sherry-Netherland was too crowded , when they arrived at the party , for Marjorie to be able to see whether or not Noel was there . Perhaps four hundred people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were strolling about the smoky flower-decked room and chattering , with highballs or glasses of champagne in their hands . " Usual brawl , " Sandy said . They were standing inside the door , on the reception line . The engaged couple and their parents were hidden by shuffling handshakers . " It 's such a waste , " Marjorie said . " I swear I 'll never have a big party . I 'll save the money . " " You 'll have the big party , " Sandy said . " Why do you keep looking at the door ? " " I was n't looking at the door at all . " The handshakers ahead gave way , there was an open space , and Marjorie was face to face with Marjorie Sundheimer . Immediately she glanced at the ring . It was a very large oblong diamond , but not the largest Marjorie had ever seen ; and she felt more kindly toward the girl . Marjorie Sundheimer said , " Margie , I 'm so glad you could come ! " Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked more nearly pretty than Marjorie would have thought possible . She wore a striking floor-length green and orange gown , with curiously draped shawl sleeves . Marjorie was glad , after all , that her blue dress was insignificant . Her only safe note today was cheerful dowdiness . Billy Ehrmann grasped her hand eagerly . He was perspiring , his shirt was bunched up , and his gray suit was too new . His blond hair hung straight down on his forehead . " Margie ! " She said demurely , " The other Margie . All the luck in the world , Billy . " He spluttered , " Well , gosh  --  Margie  --  say , did you ever meet my folks ? Mother , this is her , this is Marjorie Morgenstern . " Mrs. Ehrmann 's mechanical smile dissolved , as she glanced at Marjorie , into a look of intense alert friendliness . " Well , Marjorie Morgenstern ! My dear , I 'm very glad to see you . Dad ! " She pulled at the elbow of a tall bald man beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's Marjorie Morgenstern . " He looked around quickly . A long face , a curved long jaw , deep-set blue eyes , scrawny cords in his cheeks and neck ; he was Noel grown old . His voice was deep and slow . " Well , my dear , this is a privilege . I-Iow do you do ? " " How do you do , Judge Ehrmann ? "  | " You 'll stay a while , wo n't you , Marjorie ? " the mother said . " I really want to talk to you . " " Yes , of course . " Sandy went off to get her a scotch and soda . She was pushed here and there by people hurrying past . She began to make her way toward the wall , peering around for Noel . " Hi , Margie . Thought you 'd be here . " Wally Wronken came plowing through the crowd , holding by the hand an amazingly young-looking girl with a very pretty face , and the puzzled happy eyes of a baby animal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like you to meet Marjorie Pechter . " " Great day ! " Marjorie said . " How many Marjories are there in this Godforsakentown ? " " Not many where I come from , " said the girl in a high little voice . " I 'm from Harrison , New York . " " Marjorie 's a freshman at Barnard , " Wally said . " You look wonderful . " " I live in the dorms , " the girl said . " Where 's Noel ? " Wally said . " I do n't know . I 'm here with Sandy Goldstone . " Marjorie plunged away toward the wall . She landed near the musicians , and sank on a red and gilt chair . Sandy brought her the drink and went off again . Marjorie sat watching the blatheringcrowd with the detachment of a Hindu . A third or more of the faces were familiar , the same faces she had seen all through college at school dances , at parties , and at the hotel grills . The boys ' faces were heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had paired off and married seemed to be making more noise and drinking more than the others . " Hey there , Margie ! Where 's Noel ? " The saxophonist was waving at her . She recognized him  --  a South Wind musician ; then she realized that all four players were from the camp band . She went and talked to them . " Noel recommended us , " the saxophonist said . " We play these dates all winter , Marge . " The musicians raised their eyebrows at each other when she said she had n't come with Noel . Wally Wronken reappeared without the Barnard girl , and asked her to dance . His flat-footed style had not much improved . " Where 's your date , Wally ? " He tossed his head , with the look of concentration he always wore dancing . " Over there , somewhere . " Marjorie saw the girl , talking to three of the younger boys , laughing and turning bright eyes from one to the other . " She reminds me of me  --  a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , " Wally said gloomily . " Good kid , but very vanilla-flavored . " " What 's my flavor ? Red pepper ? " " Samian wine in a cup of gold . " " Very pretty . I 'll bet you never drank Samian wine in your life . " " It 's in some Byron poem . It sounds right for you . " " Samian wine ! That 's your whole trouble , Wally Wronken . You 'll prob/ably find out some day it 's a horrible Greek vinegar that puts fur on your teeth . " " You sound like Noel . " " What of it ? You 've always sounded like Noel . It 's just something that happens to people who 've been around him . " " I know . How is he ? " " Have n't seen him lately . " Wally leaned back and looked at her . " How lately ? " " None of your business . " " Are you two going to get married ? " " Not that I know of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Congratulations . " " Will you come to the opening with me ? " " Now listen , do n't go dragging your grandmother to that again , it looks very odd , Wally . You take Marjorie Pechter . She 's charming . " " She 's unconscious . I do n't know how she finds her way around the streets . " " Do n't be such a snob . You 'd better get used to the idea that there are n't many girls as bright as you , my lad , or you 'll die a mean old bachelor . " Sandy cut in . His smooth dancing was a relief . But for the moment she missed Wally 's worship , his tender constrained hold on her waist . She and Sandy were as easy together as two girls . She started glancing toward the door again . At the bar they encountered Phil Boehm and Rosalind , both half drunk . Since Rosalind was obviously pregnant , Marjorie was shocked , and said something about it . Rosalind wagged her head . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all , just a baby-making machine . Nothing interferes . Turn ' em out like Fords , do n't I , Phil ? " " Like doughnuts , " said Phil Boehm . " Good Lord , " Marjorie said to Sandy , as the Boehms waltzed unsteadily away with their highballs splashing in their hands , " what comes over the married ones at engagement parties ? I sometimes think --  " There he was . He stood in the doorway , far down the room , tall , blond , dressed in black , looking around with the casual majesty of a big cat . She was n't the only one who noticed him . Lines converging on him might have been drawn through eyes everywhere in the room . There were four girls at the party , to Marjorie 's knowledge , who had had romances with him ; all were now married . There were others , without a doubt . He was a legend to many men , too , who were staring just as hard . He strolled into the room , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized his hand , and began chattering . Two couples stopped dancing and went to him . In a moment he was surrounded and hidden . Now for the first time Marjorie became aware that lines of eyes were converging on her , too , and that Sandy was regarding her with dejected amusement . She realized she had been stretching her neck and staring . Shep229became dreadfully confused , almost dropped her highball , and spilled it slightly , taking a hurried sip . " Getting crowded , is n't it ? " Sandy said . She smiled piteously at him , and took another sip . He said , " Well , he 's good-looking . I hope you can handle him . They say he 's quite a boy . " " He is , Sandy . " " What 's the matter with his arm ? " She was startled . She had not thought of the deformity since the summer , nor indeed consciously seen it . " Why , nothing much . I 'm surprised you noticed it at this distance . Let 's dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw the long tapered hand in the black sleeve touch Sandy 's shoulder . " Cut ? " " Sure . Take good care of her , she 's fragile , " Sandy said , handing the girl over . " I know , " Noel said . " Fragile as chrome steel . " They danced in silence for a few seconds . " Thanks for nothing , " Marjorie said . " Chrome steel , indeed . " " How 've you been ? " " Oh , just deliriously happy . And you ? " " Busy , sort of . Is Max here ? " She peered up at him . " Max ? " " Dr. Shapiro , the stomach man . " " Go to hell . " " I mean it . That 's what engagement parties are really for , you know . You confront the unattached ones with the terror of passing time , and they start pairing off in panic , then and there . Half the marriages in the world are started up at engagement parties . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , he has n't showed , so you 're still stuck with me , Noel Airman . " " Who , me ? I never heard of you . " The saxophonist shouted , " Hi , Noel . " Noel nodded , grinning . The musiciansfinished the number and swung without a pause into It 's Raining Kisses . Marjorie noticed that people were watching them . A thin irregular line of spectators now bordered the dance space , and there were fewer couples on the floor . " Are you still working for Sam Rothmore ? " " Sure . It 's no picnic , either . Sam gets a day 's work out of you for his money , believe me . None of that brandy-and-chess charm in working hours . In fact he 's a pretty coarse bully . I do n't mind . He amuses me . But he keeps me jumping . " " Keeps you too busy to call me , I take it . " " Oh no , no . Do n't blame Sam . " " Well , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look , I do n't care if you never call me again . " " I 'm sure of that . " The music changed , and the tempo . A chill passed through Marjorie 's  |p230body  . They were beginning the South Wind Waltz . " Would n't you know . Damn their hides , " she murmured . Noel was holding her close . " Pleasant little tune , " he said . " Not very original , but sweet . " Marjorie was flooded with painful feelings : memories of Samson-Aaron , of the smell of the South Wind trees at night in the moonlight , of fierce kneeweakeningkisses , of the grease-paint odors backstage . . . There were only two other couples still dancing . The ring of staring , whispering onlookers had thickened . " I 've had enough , " she muttered . She broke away , still holding Noel 's hand , and dragged him off the floor . " What 's the matter ? " he said . She pressed through the spectators , pulling him along . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the dance of the seven veils . It 's so smoky in here ! Let 's walk in the hall . Let 's get out of this room --  " " Noel ! Wait ! " A middle-sized woman wearing a caracul coat and a Russian-stylecap of the same fur came hurrying through the crowd , followed by a thickset man in a swinging topcoat of camel 's hair . Both carried highballs . " So ! His Majesty favors us with his presence , after all , " she said , looking keenly at Noel and then at Marjorie . Her face was that of a girl in her twenties , but there was much gray in her brown hair . " Horace and I had about given you up . We were escaping from this rat race . Quite a dancing partner you 've gotten yourself , brother dear . " " Marjorie , this is my sister Monica . And this is Horace Sigelman . " Noel 's manner all at once was strangely graceless . " Hello , Marjorie . " The woman clasped her hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a glance . " I 've heard about you . You 're prettier than anybody said . " Horace Sigelman , who had handsome tanned features and thick black hair , patted Noel on the back . His voice was hoarse and loud . " Boy , you 've got yourself a real girl this time . How about hanging on to this one ? " Noel said , " I 'll tell you , Horace , I lack the necessary charm . How about giving me lessons ? " " Shut up and dance with me , " the sister said , putting her arm through Noel 's . " You do n't mind , do you , Margie dear ? This is a once-in-ten-years proposition , you see . In fact if I had n't had five scotch and waters , or is it six , Horace --  " " Seven  --  " "  --  seven , I would n't dare approach him even now . He despises his dumb sister , though I love the big wolf . " " I do n't despise you , my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well come on , dance then . " " You and Horace are the dancers . Why do n't you give us a rumba ? " Monica 's huge blue eyes seemed to be tearful , though she was smiling gaily . She was extraordinarily attractive , with a magnetic presence not unlike Noel 's , and Marjorie realized that she must have cut down a hundred boys in her time . Her all-fur outfit was a slightly false note , strained and flashy.  | " Please , Saul , dance with your drunken sister , just once . To celebrate Billy 's great day . " She finished the drink and handed the glass to her husband . " And hurry , Noel . The next train to Portchester is at five , " Horace said . " I 'll be glad to take Marjorie off your hands . I 'll keep her happy , boy . " Noel 's glance at Horace and Marjorie was bleak . " By all means . " He followed his sister to the dance floor , and they started to glide automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt of Monica 's coat swirling outward . " Now she 'll get overheated , " Horace said , " and catch cold , getting in and out of those lousy trains . She 's always catching cold . " " She 's lovely , " Marjorie said . Horace 's face filled with pleasure ; he watched Monica proudly . " You do n't know her . Hope you pay us a visit real soon . There 's nobody like her . Say , would you like to dance ? I can get rid of this coat . " " Oh , no , thanks , Mr. Sigelman , I 've been dancing and dancing . " " Horace . We might as well be informal . Something tells me we might be seeing a little more of you . " He gave her a heavy slow roguish grin . " That Noel , he 's one hell of a guy , is n't he ? I swear I think he 's the most brilliant person I 've ever met . Monica about worships the ground he walks on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he ever married some nice down-toearthgirl , who 'd steady him up , you know , why he 'd be famous in short order . He 's an awful wild man . You know , the kind other fellows envy , until they stop to think about it . I do n't envy him any more . I used to , in a way . But I do n't now , he 's seemed sort of sad the last few years , lonely , you know , and not getting much of anywhere . " Monica said when they returned , " It 's all set , Margie . He 's going to bring you out for the day to our place as soon as the weather gets better . My brood 'll climb all over you , and drip ice cream on your dress , and it 'll be fun . " " Wonderful . " Noel said , " Providing Margie 's still talking to me . " The sister took her hand and suddenly kissed her . " ' Bye , dear , you 're sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . Take me home , Norace . Horace  --  listen to me  --  Norace . " ' She reached up , pulled her brother 's head forward and kissed him swiftly on the cheek . " Goodbye , you scoundrel . Follow Billy 's example , real soon . " " Gad , " Noel said , looking after her , " she 's ossified . Ordinarily she 'd as soon give me an arm as a kiss . " " Well , I do n't like to kiss my brother , either , it 's silly . No wonder you 're so fond of her , she 's charming . " " Who said I was fond of her ? She 's a bore , a suburban slattern with a house boiling with kids . " " You told me so yourself , at camp . You also said Horace was a lump of pig fat . I think you 're wrong there . He 's very likable . " " Did I call Horace that ? That 's rather neat . Were n't we going outside ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fake palms in green tubs , and on these there were couples talking earnestly , holding hands , kissing . " Here , you see ? " Noel said . " The pairing-off process is wellp232advanced already . A pity Max , the doctor , did n't show up . You two are starcrossedlovers . Why , to miss such an opportunityMarjorie said , " I must have no sense of humor , after all . I do n't think Max , the doctor , is funny any more . " " You 're getting sensitive . " " Well , it 's the drop of water on the stone , you know . " " I erase that joke from my repertoire . You will never hear it again . " " Thank heaven . " " I 'll miss Max , though . I was getting fond of him . " They were strolling past the ladies ' lounge . Phil Boehm leaned against the wall beside the door , his hair rumpled , a droopy-eyed grin on his face . Marjoriesaid , " Hi . Is Roz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Li'l sick , she says . " " Shall I go in and help ? " " No , no , no . Four gals with her now . " Marjorie said as they walked away , " Maybe you can tell me why the marriedones cut up so horribly at these things . " " Good Lord , is that a question ? To forget , of course , " Noel said . " To forgettheir own high hopes , and their sad mornings after . To forget the budgets that do n't balance , the friends with bigger cars , the baby 's sore throats , the sleepless nights , the bloody miscarriages , the procession of quitting maids , the flatness of routine sex , the neurotic mother-in-law poisoning their lives  --  " " You make marriage sound like a nightmare . " " Do I ? I do n't mean to . No , time passes and the path narrows and narrows , and after a while there 's nothing to do but marry . But marrying does n't help , you 've just got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just goes on being a series of decreasingly pleasant choices . And you wonder why the married ones get drunk  --  " " Well , I 'll say this , a girl would be absolutely crazy to marry a man who thinks the way you do . " He turned on her , and his look was so scornful that she started back a little . " Are n't we past those devious female noises yet ? You 'd marry me in two seconds if I asked you . " " You 're the most unbearably conceited man I 've ever met . " " Listen , Marjorie , you 've been lying awake nights thinking of me . Those rings under your eyes ! You look awful . " " You fiend , of course I 've been thinking of you ! Have n't you been making love to me for a year ? " " Well , why the devil did n't you telephone me then ? " " Telephone you ? You said you 'd call me . " His laugh was a short bitter burst . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Margie , ever hear of the French king who roasted to death rather than move his chair back from the fireplace with his own hands ? You 've got him beat hands down . The heavens can fall , but Shirley 's protocol must be observed , is n't that the idea ? " She faced him . " You said you were starting work and might be busy for a  |p233while  . You know you did . The way you left it , no girl with any self-respect would have called a devil like you . It would have been nagging , crawling --  " " You 're all wrong . Girls call up devils like me every day in the week , Margie , girls with all kinds of pride and self-respect . Why , the land rings from coast to coast with such calls . Only they never call for a date , do n't you see ? They call about a book they meant to borrow , or because they heard you were sick , or they dialled the wrong number by mistake , or some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm around her waist . They were at the end of the corridor , looking out of the window at a crimson sunset over the bluish downtown buildings . He said after a moment , " I 'm sorry . I should have called you , I know . But it was better not to . I 've been in a foul mood , and still am , and that 's the truth . Going straight , keeping nine-to-five hours  --  the old Adam dies hard , Margie . And of course , in my lowest moments it 's always you I blame . However --  " He kissed her temple lightly . " Come , one dance and then I must leave you . " " Where are you going ? " " I have a date . " " Anybody I know ? " He grinned . " Janice Gray . " He grinned wider at the fall of her countenance . " Listen , she 's a lonesome old bat . She 's the mistress of a sweater manufacturer who 's on his way home from Europe to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know anybody in New York . She 's not bashful , she phones me all the time . She does n't like me at all , but I 'm sort of a neutral presentable dancing partner . She pays all the checks , so I 'm not wastingmy hard-earned funds . " Marjorie said angrily , " No doubt you 're standing in for the sportswear manufacturer in bed , too . " He looked her in the eye . " No . " " No ? " " No . She is n't interested , and anyway , she 's inches deep in makeup . It would be like trying to make love to a greased pig . " With a nervous giggle Marjorie said , " That 's some way to talk about a movie star . You 're lying to make me feel good . " In the ballroom the musicians had stopped playing . Noel said , " Well , guess I 'll pay my disrespects . " He went up to the exhausted Sundheimers , with Marjorie on his arm , and urbanely congratulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He slapped Billy on the back . " My boy , read your Genesis again . The younger ones are n't supposed to marry first . " Judge Ehrmann said heavily , " You 'd better read your Genesis again , Saul . That applied only to the daughters . " " Well , all the same , " Noel said to Marjorie Sundheimer , " do n't be surprised if you wake up on your wedding morn and find yourself married to me . It 's an old Biblical custom . " Marjorie Sundheimer said , " I 'm afraid I 'd never stop running . " The judge laughed hoarsely . " So long , Mother , " Noel said . He bent and kissed her pink wrinkled cheek  | " Are you going already ? You just came . " She accompanied them out to the elevator , saying to Noel , " Why do n't you come up to dinner , say next Friday , and bring your little friend here , Marjorie ? It 's been so long --  " Noel said , " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense . " As the elevator door slid open , Marjorie suddenly said , " Mister , this is your last date with Janice Gray . " " Who says so ? " " I do . " " Goodbye , girls . Have a nice chat , now . " At midnight Marjorie telephoned Noel . There was no answer . She sat in bed reading her novel until one , and called again . No answer . She dropped the book and thought about the engagement party . She was still appalled at the wretched incident that had ended the afternoon . One of Noel 's former girls , married for five years , the mother of two children , had staggered up to her and , with distorted features and thick speech , had begun gabbling disconnectedlyabout Noel . Completely out of control , the woman had shrugged off her husband 's embarrassed efforts to stop her , and her voice had become louder and her smile queerer . Sandy at last had hurried Marjorie out of the room , with the woman shouting after her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd better know about Saul Ehrmann --  " When the minute hand stood at exactly two , she called his apartment again . " Hello ? " He sounded sleepy . " Hello . It 's Shirley . " " Holy smoke ! " His voice rose with pleasure . " Calling a man at two in the morning --  " " I know . I 'm totally depraved . You 've ruined me . " " Well , it 's nice to hear from you , ruined or not --  " " I hope I 'm not disturbing you . Is Janice Gray there ? " " Oh , do n't be a jackass . I dropped her at the Waldorf an hour ago . How about coming down here ? We 'll neck . " " Not a chance . " " Well , then , come down here and fight me off . " " No . I had enough trouble fighting off Susan Hoff en this afternoon . " " Oh my Lord . " His voice grew cautious . " Do n't tell me  --  was she drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how nice you are and how pretty I am , on and on , with her hand gripping my arm , and her eyes popping . It gave me the creeps . " " Susan can give you the creeps , all right . She hates her husband , and she takes it out on the world . " " Just one of the broken blossoms along your path , Mr. Airman . " " Oh , sure . They litter the West Side . Only Susan victimized me , as it happens . Turned around and got married because we 'd had a fight , and left me stunned for months . Now it 's all my fault , obviously , and will be till she dies . " " Obviously . And you 're still brokenhearted about her . Or is it Betty Frank ,  |p235or  Irene Goren , or Ruth Mendelsohn , or Marilyn Lubin ? You ought to write a book . " He laughed . " Well , what can I do for you ? " " Not a thing . " " You called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a silly fuss about it . Also , I want to borrow a book . " " Now you 're talking . What book ? " " Oh , I do n't know , any book . Plato 's Republic . " " That 's a honey . Hell of a trick ending . I 'll give it to you when I see you again . " " Fine . When will that be ? " " Marjorie Morgenstern , are you asking me for a date ? " " Sure , why not ? " " Well , bless my soul . Let 's have a date right now . I 'll get dressed and come get you . " She chuckled . " Noel , do n't be insane . " " Why not ? Damn it , the only good hour is the present one . We 'll have hamburgers , and ride back and forth all night on the ferry , like Edna Millay says --  " " I 'm no Edna Millay , mister . And I 'm in bed , and my face is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would n't get up and eat hamburgers with Clark Gable . " " You definitely lack romance , " he said in a disappointed tone . " Come on , our future may hinge on this . In fact it does . Have a hamburger with me , and I 'll marry you . " " Not even for that . " " Well , all right . I 'm not sensitive . How about lunch tomorrow ? Sardi 's at one ? " " Sure . " " Gad , you 've actually called me for a date , do you realize that ? Shirley is dead . Long live Marjorie ! I swear there 's hope . Good night , my darling . " Noel cheered up strikingly after that . They called each other several times a day . It was a rare week in which they did not meet at least half a dozen times for lunch , cocktails , or dinner . They saw all the best shows and movies , went to the best concerts , and ate at the best restaurants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his Paramount job . It seemed to Marjorie that she was discovering New York City . Her college set had stayed rigidly in a zigzag path through the town , traversing a few hotel bars , night clubs , and eating-places which they considered smart . The rest of downtownNew York had been an unmapped jungle of boredom , left to the inferior animals called older people . Now Marjorie , moving toward her twenty-first birthday , and imperceptibly becoming one of those older people ,  |p236saw  that the collegians ' tastes had been as naive , in their way , as those of small-town visitors . Her brief explorations with Marsha had been limited by lack of money . But Noel suffered from no such lack ; and he loved New York . Equally with the expensive fairyland between Fifty-ninth Street and FortysecondStreet  --  which he knew from river to river like a guide  --  he loved all the sights and sounds and smells , wherever they were , provided only that they were poignant and sharp . They would go in one night from the Club Ferrara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aura of celebrities and beautifully dressed women , to the stinking fish market at the foot of Fulton Street , where , under the glare of big electric bulbs , bright fish lay in bloody heaps , and trucks ground , and hairy men in ragged sweaters cursed and yelled . Or they would ride a ferry for a nickel , hugging each other to keep warm in the icy river breeze , watching the jagged line of black skyscrapers slide past in the moonlight ; and they would laugh at the sluggish roll of the boat , the foul oil-and-garbage whiffs from the river ; then they would go to a big night club for out-of-towners , a vulgar whirl of colored feathers and naked kicking legs and bad food and wine , where thirty dollars would melt in an hour . Noel had an insatiable enthusiasm for this rounding . When Marjoriewas ready to drop , he would have some eager inspiration . " God , this is such wonderful fun , Margie . Let 's keep going . The night 's young . " " Noel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put one leg in front of another . And my eyes , they 're absolutely red . Take me home . Harlem , indeed , at this hour ! " But she would laugh . " What the devil , Marge , I have to be in an office at nine . You do n't . I tell you this joint only gets going at four , and this Ken Watt and his Kilowatts make the greatest jazz in the United States . Benny Goodman 's a fraud next to them . " " Well , for one drink . Then we go home . Promise ? " " Of course --  Taxi ! Ah , Margie , money 's the only thing . " She often slept till noon . She read Variety and Billboard regularly , and spent a lot of time at the Broadway drugstore where young actors and actressesgathered . She was pursued quite a bit by the actors , especially when her indifference to them became noticed . But their good profiles , large eyes , long hair , and knowing manners were wasted on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his name was Noel Airman . Indefatigably she made the rounds of the producers ' offices , when she was n't with Noel ; and indefatigably , like all the other young actresses , she was turned away by yawning office boys . But she was not discouraged . Life bubbled with promise . Marjorie 's parents were extraordinarily tolerant of the life she was leading . There were no questions , no objections , not even worried hints or looks . She surmised after a while that they had been talking with the Ehrmanns , and that both sets of parents had decided to keep hands off and pray for a happy outcome . Mr. Morgenstern , while continuing to exhibit fretful gloom , seemed resigned ; when he met Noel he tried hard to be pleasantly paternal . It was the most intoxicating time in Marjorie 's life ; sweeter and gayer even than her first weeks with Noel at South Wind , because now there was nothing surprising or scaring about him . Above all , the gradual pressing outp237to the limits of sex , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They joked about it . Noel said he did n't mind , and he really seemed not to care . " You 're growing up , " he said once . " That 's fine . It was you who were doing all that , really , you know . I was a helpless bystander . " And when she hooted , he said earnestly , " It 's true . And it 's true most of the time , for that matter , with nearly every couple . Of course the guy makes the first pass . It 's the code . It 's like tipping his hat , or holding the door open . The girl takes it from there , and sets exactly the pace she pleases , but exactly , unless she 's been dumb enough to get involved with some gutter brute . Why , hell 's bells , that 's what you 're doing right now . I 've kissed you good night forty times lately . Why has n't it gone into one of our old necking sessions ? Simply because you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjorie tried to look annoyed ; but she could n't help it , she burst out laughing . They were riding around the park in a hansom cab on a frigid sunny March afternoon , their cheeks red and frostbitten , their hands warmly clinging under a huge mangy fur lap robe . Noel was hatless , and his hair was rumpled by the wind . He looked like a boy . His joy of life was infectious . One glance of his laughing brilliant blue eyes could make Marjorie as dizzy and happy as if she were on a roller coaster . That was the day he persuaded her to eat a lobster . They went from a hansom cab to the Plaza and drank martinis , and all at once it was dinnertime , although they had n't planned to dine together . He said , " We 're both going to have broiled lobster , with a very delicate white burgundy . It 's the only thing , when two people are feeling so good and so foolish . " " Oh no , Noel  --  not lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . " " Oh , I know , it 's a ridiculous prejudice . Conditioning . I just do n't think I could go it , dear . " " Sure , honey . Have something else . Although from what little I know of those queer laws , is n't it just as bad to eat anything at all here ? Nothing 's kosher . " " Well , you 're right , at that . I could n't be less consistent . Does it -- is lobster really good ? " " Why , it 's the most exquisite food there is . " Marjorie said , " Somehow it does n't seem as bad as ham , does it ? I do n't think I could eat ham if you put a pistol to my head . " " Well , ham 's the symbol , the universal joke about Jews . Pride makes you take a stand on that point , and actually I think you 're right . I 'm just a sybarite . Next to lobster , there 's nothing I love like good Polish ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try the chicken curry ? They have a marvelous Indian sauce here --  " " Oh , what the devil . You 're perfectly right , even the chicken is n't kosher . What 's the difference ? I 'll try a lobster . " But when it came she gazed askance at its scarlet feelers and hairs , its numerous jointed legs , its dead eyes on stalks , its ragged pincers . " Noel , it 's  --  does n't it look like a big red dead bug ? " " Why sure . Crustaceans and arachnids are about the same thing , as a  |p238matter  of fact . " He was expertly lifting out the tail meat with a fork . " Good , though . Sweeter than the roses in May . " She took up her fork gingerly , watching how he went at it . " Well , I never thought I 'd live to eat a big old water bug . " " Why , honey , there 's all kinds of Biblical precedent for that . Did n't the prophets all live on locusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if locusts turn this ghastly red when you cook them . These things are so red . " The tail was coming out of the shell easily . She cut it , and , following his example , dipped a piece in the little bowl of melted butter , sighed , and put it in her mouth . It tasted very much like ordinary fresh fish , except that it was sweetish , and took more chewing . Not wanting to spoil the occasion , she widened her eyes and said , " Mm , exquisite . " Noel said , " Observe that no forked lightnings have come through the window to destroy you . " " Well , I did n't expect that , really . Those Bible laws were just for hot countries in the old days . " She took another bite . It was quite pleasant , especially with all the butter on it . " I wonder , though , if it would taste so good if there were no law against it . " He laughed , pouring the wine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , but they 're wrong . Prohibition is . There is n't a living Christian who can enjoy ham and eggs the way a renegade Jew like me does . " " Do n't call yourself that . " " I 'm kidding , you know . It 's all a question of upbringing . I 've had nothing to renege from . In my home we always ate everything  --  pork , oysters --  " " Really ? That 's a little surprising . " " Why ? " " Your folks are so active in Jewish causes . " " Marjorie , my father 's a politician . He 'd be active in Moslem causes , if his district had enough Arabs in it . " Marjorie had finished the three or four bites of white fishy meat that made up the lobster 's tail . Still very hungry , she stared at the creature , wondering what else there was to eat on it . It seemed quite whole and impregnable . She said , eying Noel 's lobster , " What is that part you 're eating now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft stuff ? Why , that 's the liver of the beast . It 's the best part of it . " " Is it edible , really ? I 'd say it was poisonous . " " Well , a lot of people are fool enough not to eat it because of its looks . But I assure you it 's marvelous . Try it . " Marjorie dug her fork into the green mass . It squashily yielded , oozing a thin fluid . " No , no . " She dropped the fork . " I 'm not that sophisticated , not yet . " She hurriedly drank off her wine ; then , following his example , she applied a little device like a nutcracker to one of the lobster 's claws . It did not yield . She squeezed with both hands . There was an echoing crack , and the claw flew across the table into Noel 's lap . " I 'll crack them for you , " Noel said to the blushing girl.  | " Honestly , the damned creatures are like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother . " " Practice and patience , my dear . " He deftly extracted two morsels of meat from the claws , laid them on her plate , and poured more wine . " What do you think of this wine ? Is n't it good ? " " Lovely , as always . " " Let 's go see the new French movie at the Fifty-fifth after this . " " Sure . Are n't you writing any songs , or anything ? You seem to have nothing but free time these days . " " Ah , well , I can always write songs when I 'm a little creakier . As a matter of fact I did a new first-act finale for Princess Jones the other night , and I like it . Have to play it for you . " " How are you getting along at Paramount ? " " Oh , fine , fine . Not rising as meteorically as I 'd hoped . But then , what fair prospect ever looks so fair once you 're in it ? It 's all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I not seeing eye to eye again , the old thing . " " Well , you 'd better stop disagreeing with him . He 's the boss . " Noel looked annoyed . " Suppose he 's wrong and I 'm right , just once ? It 's conceivable . I 'd match IQ 's with him for a thousand dollars . " " He has the experience , Noel , do n't forget that . " " Darling , experience nine times out of ten is merely stupidity hardened into habit .  --  Well , the hell with Sam . Let 's enjoy ourselves . I like his money , I 'll say that for him . . . . What 's the trouble now ? " Marjorie was glaring and poking at the lobster . " I 'm famished . And I do n't know how to get at this miserable thing . " " Look , you have n't even touched the legs . They 're loaded with meat . " He held the body of his lobster , and pulled a leg out with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scarlet stump . " See ? " He gnawed the meat . " Well , that seems simple . " Marjorie did exactly the same thing , she thought . But instead of the leg pulling loose , the whole center of the lobster came lifting out of the shell , and there she was , holding an oval white thing with many trembling red legs , for all the world like a spider six inches across , warm and horribly alive . With a grunt of disgust she threw it splashing into the melted butter . " I quit , " Marjorie said . " I 'll order ham next time . Damn red bug . " Noel choked with laughter over his wine . His dissatisfaction with the Paramount job was the one discordant note of this happy time . She heard it again in the weeks that followed , more frequentlyand louder . Sometimes Noel would be deep in gloom when they met , and it would take an hour or more of drinking and banter to bring him to his usual gaiety . In his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trivial necessary evil , and had refused to talk about it with Marjorie , but by the end of March he was discussing it freely and at length . It relieved him to set Marjorie laughing with his caricature of Rothmore . He marvelously sim/ulated a stooped heavy old man with half-closed eyes , talking through thick tired lips while biting on a cigar . There were two main sources of trouble . Sam Rothmore thought Noel 's taste in stories for the screen was too literary and high-flown , and he was displeased by his irregular hours , though the disapproval took no stronger form than crude sarcasm . It seemed to Marjorie , even though Noel was describing the arguments , that Sam Rothmore was right at least part of the time . Noel looked black when she ventured to say so . On the whole , naturally , she sided with Noel . There seemed little doubt that Sam Rothmore , beneath his surface of weary benevolence , was just a brutal businessman , and that his taste in movies reflected the juvenile vulgarity of Hollywood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she want to give him his due in the petty instances when he seemed right . But Noel , usually so graceful and so amusingly self-critical , was peculiarly obdurate in this . He persisted in coming late to the office and leaving early , and would not admit there was anything wrong in it . " I 'm beginning to regard myself as a test case , " he said to Marjorie , " a milestone in the educationof Sam Rothmore , and the whole Hollywood machine . " " Do n't try to change the world , Noel . Paramount 's a business . Businesses have to run on a system . " " True , dear , and exceedingly profound , but this is a unique business . It employs creative talent and original insight . Therefore , time and motion studies become slightly absurd . As for instance , working in the office with me is one Morris Mead , also an assistant story editor , a good fellow , a drudge , been there fifteen years . I 've been there a month . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports to his one , and Sam concedes that my reportsare clearer , better , and more useful . Morris arrives at nine and leaves at five . So much for system . " One rainy evening late in March Noel took her to the opening night of a musical comedy . When they came into the lobby for a smoke after the first act , Marjorie saw familiar signs of depression in Noel ; he was avoiding her glance , and repeatedly rubbing one hand over his eyes . His tone remained level and light . " It 's a sure hit . I know the boys who wrote it . They 've been doing the summer shows at Camp Paradise for years . Maybe one of these decades I 'll write a show . " " You 'll have a show on Broadway one of these months , and it 'll be a lot better than this one . " He smiled at her . " Keep saying those things . " A woman at his elbow said , " Noel ! Of course it 's Noel ! Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he smiled . " Why , hello , Muriel . How are you ? You look wonderful , as always . " The woman said , " Good Lord , how many years is it now ? " Her dress was a billowing swath of rust-colored taffeta and she wore many diamonds . She had a tiny nose , a sharp chin , and pinched cheeks , and her black hair seemed varnished in place . She held a cigarette high in two straight fingers . " Do n't start reckoning them up , " Noel said . " You wo n't enjoy the second act . How are you ? And the kids , and the hubby ? "  | " We 're all just wonderful . " She peered around at the crowd . " I 'll have to tell Marty you 're here  --  he 'll get a kick out of it . " Noel said , " Marjorie Morgenstern , Mrs. Hartz . " They nodded at each other . Mrs. Hartz with an eye-blink looked Marjorieover and turned back to Noel . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't change . " " Dorian Gray . " " I 'll bet . Well ! Noel Airman . You keep turning up like a bad penny , do n't you ? " She laughed . " I 'm always looking for your name in the theatre columns . Noel , and I do n't see it . " " Well , the truth is , I 've become a Trappist monk , Muriel , " Noel said . " It happens I 'm in the world of vanity tonight , as an extreme penance . I was late for vespers . " " Ha , you a monk , that 's a good one . " The woman glanced at Marjorie , laughing nervously . " That 'll be the day . Say , maybe we can all go out and have a drink afterward . We 're here with a crowd from Rye , but you can join us , they 're lots of fun . They 'd love to meet you . " " Do n't you have to catch a train ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " Please do look for us . It 's nice to see you . It 's amazing . You just do n't change . " She smiled at Marjorie , and moved off into the crush , puffing at her cigarette . Noel said softly to Marjorie , " You gather who that was , no doubt . " " It ca n't be the Muriel you told me about . She 's over thirty-five . " " She is Muriel , though . Muriel Weissfreid . Muriel Weissfreid of the bluevelvet and white arms . And she 's thirty-three . " He dropped his cigarette andtrod on it . " Let 's go in . " Marjorie said when they were in their seats , " She 's really not bad-looking , you know  --  I mean , for thirty-three . It 's just that you described her as such a beauty , and  --  well , she 's just another one of those dressed-up mamas from the suburbs . " He stared at her . " just another one of those dressed-up mamas from the suburbs ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you feel a chill ? You 've just spoken your own epitaph . " " Oh , shut up . I 'll die before I 'll live anywhere but in Manhattan . " " Promise ? " " Of course . I ca n't stand the suburbs . " " You would n't change your mind , and drag a husband out there after having a baby or two , would you , because all your friends were doing it , and the grass and fresh air were wonderful for kids ? " " No , I would n't . " " All right . . .. You noticed that glittering boulder on her finger , I sup-pose ? " " Well , actually , no . I kept looking at her face , trying to see what you saw in her . " " Believe me , it was all there once , Marjorie . She had the face of anp242angel . " The music started and the lights dimmed . He slouched in his scat . " I feel tired . " When the show was over Noel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hit . Sure hit . " He gathered up his overcoat . " Let 's duck , shall we , and see if we can avoid Muriel ? " The audience was still applauding as they slipped out through a side door . The sidewalks were wet and black , with fiery streaks reflected from the electricsigns , but the rain had stopped . They walked to the corner of Broadway , and stood undecided . " What would you say to some deafening jazz in a small dark cellar ? " Noel said . " Anything you feel like doing . " " All right . " He gazed around at the blazing dancing advertisements , and then up at the sky . " Look . Over all this spectacular foolishness , there 's the black sky and the misty moon . " " The sky looks more like pink here , " Marjorie said , glancing up . " I never noticed that . " " All these people are going to die , " Noel said . " All of them . They have just a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the last one of them 's dead , the crowds hurrying along this pavement under an unnoticed moon will be just as big , and the faces will all look the same . " " Do n't be so morbid . The light 's green for us . Let 's cross . " Noel said as they hurried in front of the massed taxicabs , " Can you int . imagine the moon as an eye , the eye of God , looking down into this lighted square in the darkness ? This must look like some great religious pageant . Hordes , hordes marching everywhere , and over them in great letters of fire the thundering words , Smoke Camels . " Marjorie said , " Everything seems silly , in view of the fact that you 're going j to die , but what do you want everybody to do , cut their throats ? You 're just in a bad mood . Muriel , or something . Take my advice and do n't think about death . " He laced her fingers in his . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom in a couple of banal sentences . The effect is n't to make you seem wise , but to reduce all the philosophers to the level of twenty-one-year-old girls . How do you explain this curious phenomenon ? " " The philosophers are a pretty sad lot , if they ca n't make any better sense of the world than I do . " " Believe me , they do n't . " They sat at a tiny table directly in front of four blasting Negro musicians in a club called , for no visible reason , the Tibet Room . Noel drank off half his scotch and soda , clinked down the glass , and said , " Would it upset you very much if we made this our farewell night , and never saw each other again ? " " Do n't be a fool . " " I 'm absolutely serious . Listen carefully . " He spoke with peculiar clarity over the gales of jazz . " I 'm never going to amount to anything . I 'm all surface . Everything I have goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of central organizing energy . Furthermore , I 'm past my peak . I was wittier andp243more energetic four years ago . I 'm very tired . At the moment I feel sorry for you , for being in my toils . There 's such a horrible gap between you and Muriel ! I 've spanned a generation . I 'm like a vaudevillian playing the same little act forever . Give it up , Marjorie . The game is n't worth the candle , I assure you . Go find Dr. Max Shapiro , he wo n't wait forever .  --  I 'm sorry , I was n't going to mention him again , was I ? " She put her hand on his and said loudly , with a trumpet blaring in her face , " I love you , and you 're better than you ever were , and your peak is still to come . The songs you wrote in your last revision of Princess Jones were a terrific improvement over anything you 've ever played for me , including It 's Raining Kisses . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was n't it ? It really was . Last flare of a dying fire  --  " " What do you expect Muriel to do , remain looking like your college sweetheart ? It 's an old story that women age faster than men . A woman at thirtythreeis finished , just playing out the hand . A man at thirty-one is lucky if his career is even started . You know these things better than I do . You 've said them . Why are you so childish tonight ? It is n't like you at all . " He smiled at her and clasped her hand . The music was so tumultuous he could n't speak for a few seconds . Then he said , " You 're really wonderful for inc . I 'm an ass to suggest parting with you . At least I can wait till you kick me out . " " You 'll wait a long time . " " I am low , fearfully low . Another big row with Sam , and then seeing Muriel  --  I do n't know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to his apartment and necked more than they had at any time since the summer . She leaned back in his arms after a while , and said with a low laugh , " Well , you 're not quite the washed-up old man after all , are you ? " He released her and looked at her in the dim light with no great friendliness , smoothing his mussed hair . " Why , you calculating little cat . You 're doing this to cheer me up . " " Not at all . I liked it . " " You liked it . " He lit a cigarette and strode around the room . " You ca n't imagine , you ca n't have the faintest idea , of how completely exasperating you are . And I used to think you were passionate . Why , you 're about as passionate as an adding machine . " " Oh , do n't start on that again , Noel  --  " He stood over her , and for a moment she thought he might hit her . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , indeed . Trapped in a platonic relationship with Marjorie Morgenstern , of 740 West End Avenue . Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord , I will repay . ' " He stroked her hair . " Come on , let 's have some hot dogs . " They roasted frankfurters on long forks over embers in the littered firelace , and drank beer , and played symphonies on his huge phonograph , the my valuable thing in the shabby room . Gradually he cheered up . It was past uce when she left , and he was quite himself again . He took her downstairsp244and put her in a cab . Kissing her good night , he said , " You have n't the faintest idea of how much good you do me . You 're adrenalin . You saved my life tonight . One of these days I may repay you , darling . " The telephone woke her . She blinked at her clock ; it was half-past nine . " Hello ? " she said hoarsely . " Are you dressed ? We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you crazy , Noel ? I 'm fast asleep . What are you doing up so early ? Airplane ? I 've never been in an airplane --  " " Well , you 're going in one . I have to run an errand for Sam up to Albany , and I 'm going in a taxi plane . You too . We leave at eleven , so get ready . " " Eleven ? Noel , I ca n't possibly make it . Are n't you exhausted ? I am -- - " " Have n't been to sleep . Wrote a song after you left . Best yet . Wait till you hear it . I feel absolutely marvelous . " She dressed in a rush , and left without telling her mother where she was going . There was no time to argue , and she would have overridden her mother 's protests anyway . The gay timbre of his voice had set her tingling despite the weariness weighing down her limbs . She met him at the Paramount Building and they rode out to the airport in Sam Rothmore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the collar turned up , and carried a thick sealed brown envelope . " What 's it all about , Noel ? " " Oh , high intrigue . An assemblyman 's making a speech today about the movie admissions tax situation . Needs these papers by one o'clock . Sam gave ( me no details , just asked me if I was afraid to fly , and then handed me t envelope . Ca n't use a regular messenger , it 's all hush-hush , for some reason I feel like the Scarlet Pimpernel . " It was incredible , Marjorie was thinkin how this man changed with the days and the hours . Today he was the gait blond god of South Wind again , full of force and dash , his eyes sparkling . have n't slept a wink , do you know ? Wait till you hear Old Moon Fa . It 's a real crack-through . I feel it in my bones . We 'll be rich . Came to walking around in the rain last night after you left --  " " I 'm dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrowly clearing the telephone wires , s thought she would faint from choking joyous alarm . It was a four-seat single-motor plane , piloted by a morose man in a worn leather windbreaker . The windows rattled and whistled , the wings flapped , and the sides and t seat shook as in a very old Ford . But she did n't care . She was terribly afraid , but even more exhilarated , and it seemed like a good way to die if her thud were at hand ( which she did n't believe ) . The plane thrashed its way up the Hudson River valley , and Marjorie and Noel held hands and looked ! down through empty space at towns , fields , hills , and the river , a brilliant storybook picture in glaring sunlight . A car was waiting at the Albany airport with an emissary from the assemblyman . Ten minutes after they landed the were in the air again , flying south , straight into the white blaze of the sun . '  |p245Marjorie  was drunk with the speed , the scare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noel was inexhaustible , she thought . He threw off surprises and thrills like a pinwheel ; it was his nature , his pattern . She would never find a man like him again . There were n't two in the world . She leaned over and kissed him passionately on the mouth , straining at her safety belt . lc looked at her in astonishment , and roared in her ear , " Well , if that 's all it hikes , I 'll charter a plane and we 'll fly to Albany every day . " They glided down over Manhattan in clear afternoon light , making a lazy circle above the towers , the bridges , the Statue of Liberty , the steamships , the glittering harbors . The thud of the landing gear on the turf of the airprtwas a gloomy sound . He said , unstrapping his belt , " You 're coming with me to the office . " " Nothing doing . " " Sam 's got a piano in his inner office . Must play you Old Moon Face . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should n't even have gone in the plane --  " " You 're a hopeless prig . Sam knew I was taking you , and told me to bring you to the office . He wants to meet you . Satisfied ? " She was awe-stricken by the Paramount offices . The panelled walls were lined with huge ikon-like portraits of stars ; and the Paramount trade-mark , which she had been seeing on movie screens all her life , was carved , printed , or painted on the glass doors , on the posters , on the portraits , over the archways , filling the offices with the Arabian Nights magic of Hollywood . Noel returned the receptionist 's smiling nod , and led Marjorie through a door marked Private . No Entrance , into a little blue-painted library room lined with leather-bound books , with a movable bar in it , and a spinet piano . " Cosy , eh ? " " It does n't look like a business office at all . " " That 's right . This is where the really cutthroat deals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd offer you a drink , but Sam foams at anybodydrinking during working hours . " " Well , thanks , I do n't want one . Are you sure this is all right , our being in here ? " " All Sam can do is fire me , which I rather wish he would . " He tossed his coat on a small sofa and sat at the piano . " It 's amazing , songwriting , when you think about it , " he said , rippling chords . " The right little combination of notes , the lucky little pattern of words , all of it lasting no more than a minute or two , and the man who writes it suddenly owns , in effect , an office building or an oil well . It 's like a contest . Write the magic jingle , and win the grand prize . Well , here 's the magic jingle of 1936 , kid . Noel Airman 's Old Moon Face . " Marjorie felt the gooseflesh rise as he sang it . The song was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wistful old bachelor peering down at the lovers n the street , following them to their apartment , staring in at the bedroom indow , envying them their joy . The suggestiveness of the lyric was maskedthe last touch , the wedding ring of the girl glittering in the moonlight , she pulled down the shade to shut out lonely Old Moon Face.  |p246She  threw her arms around Noel 's neck . " Bless you , it is a hit . " " I know it is , " Noel said . " I 'm dickering for a villa on the Riviera . The melody 's really got something , has n't it ? " He began to play it again . The door to the outer office opened and Simi Rothmore came in , complete as Marjorie had pictured him to the cigar in his teeth . His clothes were dark , correct , elegant , his pink wrinkled hands were manicured , and there was a touch of majesty in his bearing despite the stoop , or perhaps because of it . " What 's all the music-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caricatured so well . Noel jumped up . " Sam , the envelope 's been delivered . Assemblyman Morton 's secretary was  --  " Rothmore nodded . " I talked to Morton on the phone an hour ago . Thanks . " He was looking at Marjorie . " Hello , I 'm Rothmore . And you 're Marjorie Morgenstern , and you 're a friend of this low-life . " " I hope I 'm not intruding --  " " Not a bit . You 're a breath of fresh air in the old factory . Well , how 'd you like the plane ride ? " " Marvelous . I just wanted to go on flying forever . " His glance flickered ironically to Noel , and back to her , and she noticed the terrible blue shadows under his eyes . " Well , go ahead , Noel , finish what you were playing . " " It 's a new song he just wrote , , " Marjorie said . " I think it 's superb . " " Oh , you wrote a new song ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Noel said , in a manner curiously mingling fear and arrogance , " Sam , I turned in three reports before I left . Your secretary has them , and I told you  --  " " I read your reports . " " Oh . Are they all right ? " " Let 's hear your song . " He sat heavily in an armchair and looked at Noel . " Well , play the song . " " Are you really interested ? " Noel stood awkwardly beside the piano stool " I like to know all about my staff 's talents . Go ahead . What 's the title Noel told him . Rothmore nodded slowly , leaning on an elbow in the archair . Noel played and his employer sat slumped , holding the cigar , his cyon the wall . Marjorie noticed that he breathed through his mouth in shallolittle gulps . When the song was over , he said after a moment , " It 's all right . " " I think it 'll be a hit . A hell of a hit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjorie said . Rothmore sighed . " What got you started writing songs again ? Are n't keeping you busy ? " " Sam , the thing just popped into my head and I wrote it out . At five this morning , if you want to know . On my own time . " Rothmore glanced at his wristwatch . " I guess I 'll have a scotch and sod &; Usually it makes me sleepy in the daytime , but I had too much coffee for lunch . " He started to get up , but Noel sprang to the bar . " I 'll get it , Sam .. " Rothmore sank back in his chair , saying , " Make drinks for everybody . " Hep247turned to Marjorie . " See ? That 's what we do to ourselves . We keep tighteningup our nerves with tobacco and coffee , then loosening them with alcohol . We do it all our lives . Then we blame God when we die young . " " I 'd rather die ten years younger and smoke and drink all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're talking through your hat . Wait till you 're clipping the last few coupons like me . " " I 'm glad you like Old Moon Face , Sam . " Rothmore shrugged . " It 's a good song . So what ? " " So lots and lots of money , " Noel said . " Acres of cash . " " Grow up , " Rothmore said . " How much money does a hit song make , five thousand dollars ? Ten is a lot . " " Why , some of them make a hundred thousand . " Rothmore screwed up his face and thrust the cigar in his teeth , and Marjoriecould hardly keep herself from laughing , he so exactly resembled Noel 's imitation of him . " What are you talking about , the freaks ? Bananas and Silver Threads ? Are you figuring on writing a freak ? Why do n't you just buy yourself a sweepstakes ticket ? It 's less work , and a much surer thing . What did you make on It 's Raining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rothmore , handing him a drink . " To a hair . Been checking with my publisher ? " " I know the business , a little bit . Once I owned a piece of a publishing house . Songwriting 's for kids . Set aside your handful of geniuses , your Gershwins , Porters , Berlins , Rodgers , and there 's nothing in it . Get yourself a small producer 's job and you can hire and fire songwriters , good ones , all day like messenger boys . " " What does that prove ? A creative man does n't care which chairwarmer is hiring or firing him , " Noel said . " It 's just the stupid bookkeeping of his career , which any fool can do . " " That sounds good , " Rothmore said , " except that all the songwriters out there are breaking their necks , trying to warm chairs and do some stupid bookkeeping . Scribbling is n't all there is to creation . That 's lesson number one of this business . Though I can see that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his chair . " Well , we 're boring Marjorie . " " No , no , " the girl said , curled on the couch , watching the two men . Rothmore 's look , resting on her , became kindly . He drank off his highball . Let me take both of you to dinner tonight . " Noel glanced at Marjorie , who said , " Do n't we have tickets for a show ? " " Never mind tickets , " Rothmore said . " If you have any , change them for nother night . " Noel said to the girl , " You do n't argue with Sam . Thanks , Sam , it 'll be , Ind . " Rothmore walked slowly out , leaving behind a gray haze of rich-smelling cigar smoke . She knew from the gossip columns that it was the most expensive restaurantin New York . The furnishings were old-fashioned , even dowdy , but thep248food was unbelievable , and the wines better than any Noel had ever ordered . It was food such as Marjorie had read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvels of the cooking art really existed . The caviar , the soup , the steaks , were all sauced and seasoned to a creamy perfection of taste that was almost humiliating ; she felt a bit like a barbarian encountering ; civilization . So numbed was she by the pleasant assault on her senses that she began following the argument between Noel and Rothmore only when their voices rose . Noel apparently wanted the company to buy an obscure Italian novel , twenty years old , which could be had for fifteen hundred dollars . Rothmore said it was n't worth fifteen cents to the company . " It 's for Eu ropeans . It 's adultery among the poor , and the foreign poor at that , and she dies . What do you want to do , empty the theatres ? " Noel said , " You assume the American people are too dumb to recognize a good thing . It 's an anti-democratic notion , did you ever stop to think of that ? They 're not too dumb to elect the right president . Or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you think we opened our doors yesterday ? We do n't have to assume a damn thing . We know . Will you ever get it through your head that a movie house is a candy store ? The people are not dumb at all . They 're a hell of a lot too smart for the likes of you . You try to sell them bread and spinach in your candy store , and they 'll go to the candy store around the corner . You get the reputation for being a stupid bastard , and after a while your store closes . Look , Noel , the Europeans keep making the kind of pictures you like . In their own countries , the people line up for our pictures , and their art plays to half-empty houses . The people have decided what movies should be , not us . That 's the democracy you 're talking about . We 'll make anything they want . You ca n't ram what you like down their throats . You 're not in Russia . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A movie house is n't a candy store at all , it 's more like a library . You 've filled the library with pap and prurience , catering to the lowest instincts of the people , instead of meeting your cultural responsibility  --  " " Cultural responsibility . " Rothmore buried his head in his hands . " Oh God . " He looked at Marjorie . " Do n't give ' em what they want . Hell , no . They got low instincts . Give ' em what 's good for them  --  what you think is good for them . That 's your red-hot democrat talking . Is n't that the whole damned communist idea , Noel ? Stick a gun in their ribs , and make ' em eat strawberries and cream ? " " Oh , sure , see my whiskers and my bomb ? The old story , epithets when you have no arguments . " " No arguments ? " Rothmore turned to Marjorie . " I 'm glad I had no children . If I 'd had a son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all the colleges seem to be producing these days , either rah-rah morons or this kind of souped-up snob who despises the American people --  " " A beautiful instance , " Noel said , " of the abusive non sequitur . If you do n't like Paramount movies , you 're a traitor to your country . " " All right , do you think the American people are a lot of goddamn fools ,  |p249Noel  , or do n't you ? And try to be honest for a change instead of cute . Maybe it 's important . " Noel paused , his face more serious than usual , then said slowly , " The answer is yes , but no bigger fools than any other people . God made humanity with an average IQ of 100 , Sam , and you 'll admit that 's about twenty points too low --  " " What the hell do you know about God , and what the hell is an IQ ? " Rothmore rasped . " Do you think an IQ is something real , like a nose ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it provesthat farmers are n't as smart as psychologists . If the farmers had enough time to waste to make up an IQ system , the psychologists would all come nut morons and the farmers geniuses . Because they 'd give a big credit for king able to grab a cow 's teat right , and nothing at all for counting the number of triangles in some goddamn meaningless diagram . " " You 're an anti-intellectual from way back , Sam , that 's no news . " Rothmore turned belligerently to Marjorie . " And I 'm the epithet man ! Marjorie , who 's right ? " " Oh , Lord , leave me out of it . This rice pudding is sublime , Mr. Rothmore . I 've never tasted anything so good . " " Put down the spoon and talk . Let 's see what kind of girl he 's got . " " Well "  --  she glanced sidelong at Noel  --  " I 've always thought the way Noel does about  --  I mean , I prefer the foreign movies , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put things in a little different light . If the people  --  aftermaybe they 've decided that they want heavy stuff in books , and light stuff on movie screens  --  candy , as you put it . That 's what I never thought of . " She said to Noel , who was regarding her very sourly , " Well , it 's true , is n't it ? Candy is n't good for you , and all that , but people eat tons of it , they ike it . He says the Europeans keep making serious movies , and their own people keep going for the American candy . Maybe that means the movie as in art form is really candy making . That 's what never occurred to me before . " Rothmore beamed on her , taking small gulps of air . " Bless your little heart . You at least listen to the old bastard . " He said to Noel , " She 's one in a thousand . Marry her . " Noel said , " Why , because she 's taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe yourself ? Do you call that a triumph ? She 's twenty-one years old . " " She 's smarter than you are , my boy . " Rothmore chuckled , deep in his best . " If you only knew . " With a gloating grin , he lit a cigar . " Look , why do n't you fire me , Sam ? I completely disagree with you on practically everything that matters . I 'll go on recommending the Smoke over Una kind of book till hell freezes over , because I believe in it , and nothing you say --  " Rothmore jabbed him in the chest with two fingers . " Now listen to me , unior . I was trying to talk the front office into Smoke over Etna books when you were wetting your diapers . There 's room for both kinds of pictures , that 's the whole truth of this matter . If you keep the budget low , and spot your releases in the right big-city spots , you can come out all right on a small/audience movie , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a very small part of our business in life . " He pounded the table . " We 've got to supply the neighborhood houses and small towns with three hundred movies a year , will you ever grasp that ? That 's our job . What country ever produced three hundred good books a year , or three hundred good plays , or three hundred good anything ? God damn it , your job as a story editor is to find grist for the mill , usable entertainment , usable trash , if you want to be sniffy about it . Do I need you to tell me that Smoke over Etna is a good book ? Do n't you think I can read ? When you grasp this elementary point , maybe you can start fitting into the organization . Maybe you 'll wind up producing art pictures . What the hell do I care what you do ? But you 've got to understand what business you 're in first . " Noel answered acidly , " Getting me into this business was your idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it was a good one . You 're not going to make me over in your image . If I 'm useful to you on my own terms , that 's a different matter . " Rothmore said to Marjorie , " D' you see ? This is it . You run into some kind of neurotic stone wall with this boy at a certain point . All his intellect blanks out , and you --  " " Naturally , disagreeing with you constitutes a neurosis , " Noel said . " Why do you bother with him ? " Marjorie said . " I 'm in love with him . I 'm stuck with him . " Rothmore puffed on his cigar , his lids heavy , staring at Marjorie . " Margie , there 's damn little talent in the world , and when you see it , you want something to come of it , that 's all . I 've seen a lot of young men come and go . Noel 's got something , and he 's a charming low-life somehow , and if he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paramount , and to me . But at the present rate  --  " " You see the picture , I trust , " Noel said to Marjorie . " Sam 's joined the Save-Noel-from-Himself Club . " Rothmore looked at Noel , shook his head , and signalled for the check . " Sometimes I wonder , " he muttered . He tried to persuade them to come into his limousine , saying that they could have the car and chauffeur for the evening after dropping him at his home . But Noel would n't hear of it . The old man lumbered into the long black car . Just as the chauffeur was about to close the door Rothmore jammed his cigar in his teeth , leaned forward , and said to Noel , " Your report on the Redbook serial was all right . I phoned it out to the Coast . They 've put in a bid . Twelve thousand . " Noel 's rather glum look vanished in an eager grin . " Why did n't you say so a little sooner , you old sadist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but those I want to think about a bit more . You 're learning slowly , slowly . " He glanced from Marjorie to Noel , and the tough downward lines around his mouth softened in a smile of grudging approval . " Maybe you 'll be all right . Good night . Good night , Margie. "  |p251When  Mrs. Morgenstern first suggested inviting Noel and his parents to the family 's Passover dinner , the seder , Marjorie thought it was an appalling idea . On reflection , however , she decided that there was some hard good sense in it . With Noel doing well at Paramount , with their relationship becoming each week more intimate and hopeful , it did seem to her that the time had come for his parents and her own to confront each other . She also thought Noel had better see the Family and glimpse her religious background . At fourteen and fifteen she had hated seders , bar-mitzvas , and all the rest , and she had taken pleasure in shocking her parents with atheistic talk . In recent years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she wanted to see how he would react . The complex rituals and symbols of the Passover feast  --  the matzo , the horseradish , the four cups of wine , the pounded nuts and apples , the hard-boiled eggs in salt water , the great goblet of wine for Elijah  --  these things , with the old family songs and the annual jokes at the same points in the Hebrew service , had attractive bitter-sweet nostalgia for her . It was fun in a way , too , to see the Family once a year , and find out which of the cousins had married , and see the new babies , and marvel at the rapid growth of the old babies . There was a risk , of course , that Noel and his parents would be dismayed and put off by the seder ; but she did n't think it was much of a risk , and anyway she was prepared to take it . She was rather afraid to bring the subject up with Noel . But to her astonishmenthe agreed very readily to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eaten ; but when she described the ceremonies to him he said , " Why , it sounds very colorful and alive . My father will undoubtedlymake a bloody ass of himself , as usual , but that might prove amusing , too . " " I should warn you that all the relatives from miles around get together at this thing , and the children , and the grandchildren , and it 's a pretty noisy mess . " " Oh . " Noel looked thoughtful , then he brightened . " Well , do n't you think that may be a good thing ? I may well go unnoticed in the crush . Of course , all your relatives will gossip about us , but if you do n't mind I do n't . " " Honestly , Noel , you 're a chameleon . If there was ever anything I dreaded , it was mentioning this thing to you . And here you are , being just as nice as pie about it . " " Darling , you really do me an injustice . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm totally selfish and immoral . Tell your mother it 's okay  --  my folks and all . " He arrived late . The seder guests were already crowded in the smoky living room , with children darting between their legs and around the furniture , laughing and squealing . Four babies in baskets and portable cribs were howl/ing in Marjorie 's bedroom , and their young mothers , wild-haired and with blouses coming out of their skirts , were rushing to and fro through the foyer , brandishing bottles , diapers , pots , and rattles . Noel grinned at Marjorie , cocking his ear to the noise , as he slipped out of his coat . She said , " Well , did n't I warn you ? " " Why , it sounds very exuberant . My father here ? " " Yes , and your mother , and they 're both in evening clothes . They go from here to a Democratic banquet . " The doorbell rang , and Marjorie 's cousins , Morris and Mildred Sapersteen , came in with their son , Neville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown . She remembered him as a particularly loud-bawling blond infant , but he was now a large redheaded boy . " Gosh , how old is Neville , anyway ? " she said to the father , who was carrying a black suitcase . Neville 's mother began taking off his coat , which was no simple thing to do , since he was rearing and tearing to get at the children in the living room , shouting , " Hi , Suzy Capoozy ! Hi , Walter Capalter ! " " He 's five , just turned five , " Morris Sapersteen said . He was Uncle Shmulka 's oldest son , a writer of advertising copy , a sad-faced young man not much bigger than his father . He set down the suitcase with a sigh . " Gosh , you 'd never believe how heavy those things can be . " " What have you got there ? " Marjorie said . " Airplanes . " " Airplanes ? " " Forty-seven airplanes . Neville wo n't go anywhere without them . " Neville , disentangling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the living room like a rocket . Marjorie introduced Noel to the Sapersteens . Morris 's wife , Mildred , a thin freckled girl with very large front teeth , and black straight hair cut like an inverted bowl , was a piano teacher of sorts , and sometimes played at family gatherings . She looked very tired . Morris opened the suitcase . It was really crammed to the top with toy airplanes of every shape , color , and size , all tumbled in a tangle of wheels and wings . " Where can I put this , Margie ? Just so he can get at them when he feels the need for them . I do n't want it to be in the way --  --  " Marjorie indicated a corner in the hallway . " It 's a nuisance , " Mildred Sapersteen said , " but we 've tried taking him places without them , and it sets up all kinds of traumas . The planes have become a sort of security symbol for him . " Noel said gravely , " A substitute for the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mildred said , " but we think it 's a compensatory mechanismfor a rather small sex organ . It 's well within the normal range , but -- Morris , leave the lid up , he goes into a frenzy if he sees it down --  " " I 'm leaving it up , I 'm leaving it up , " Morris said . " I say it 's a surrogate for masturbation , myself , but whatever it is , he wo n't go anywhere without these damn planes , that 's for sure . Whew ! There we are . " He stood and peered into the clamorous living room . " Well , I see the panic is on . Let 's go , Mildred . Where is he , anyway ? " When they were out of sight Noel collapsed against the closet door , shak/ing with laughter . " That 's right , " Marjorie muttered , " laugh at my crazy cousins --  " " Crazy ! " Noel gasped . " Honey , nearly every young married couple I know talks that way . I bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris , leave the lid up , or he 'll get a trauma --  " He choked , his shoulders quivering . " Now you know why I wo n't get married . . . . Forty-seven air-planes --  " Mrs. Morgenstern , flushed , and with an apron over a fine new purple dress , poked her head into the foyer . " What are you two billing and cooing about in a corner ? We 're starting the seder . Come in . " The flower-festooned glittering table , extended with all its leaves and eked out with a card table , stretched from the windows to the far wall of the long narrow dining room , under a blaze of bright white electric bulbs . An auxiliary table had been improvised in the living room , visible through the opened French doors , and the children were shepherded out there by Mildred Sapersteen , who volunteered to stay with them , so as to keep an eye on Neville . The children objected raucously to being steered away from the adults ' table , and Neville , in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the French doors . But the glass was cleared away , the children pacified with a round of Pepsi-Cola ; and against a background of rich lively noise , mingled with the quarrelsome chattering of the children and the muffled but powerful howls of the babies in the bedrooms , the seder began . The liveliness did not extend to the table of the adults . Here , as the ceremonies proceeded , there gradually fell a strained queer quiet , unlike the atmosphere of other years . The little people of the Family , old gray tailors , candy-store keepers , mechanics , and their wives , were terrorized by the presence of a judge and his lady ; and their grown-up sons and daughters , usually a joking and irreverent band of ordinary young Americans , wore awkward company airs . The fact that the Ehrmanns were in evening clothes did not help matters . Tiny Uncle Shmulka , the laundry sorter , jammed in his cheap frayed brown suit against the resplendent judge , kept trying in vain to shrink away , and not contaminate the great man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat clumsy and glum beside Mr. Morgenstern , supporting his father 's openingchants over the wine and the matzo with his uncertain baritone voice , and shooting occasional suspicious looks at Noel . Noel , though his behavior was faultless , seemed to make the Family even more uneasy than his parents did . A chill radiated from him , causing much of the lameness of the singing , the stumbling of the Hebrew responses , and the embarrassed side glances among the relatives . The skullcap perched on his thick blond hair somehow looked as incongruous as it would have on an animal 's head . His bearing was sober , his comments courteous ; Marjorie could not accuse him of deliberately trying to appear out of place and trapped . Nor was there anything intentionally offensive in the way he kept looking around . But the effect was to make the Family , including Marjorie , feel increasingly like painted Africans performing a voodoo rite . Mrs. Morgensterndid n't improve things by trying to explain the ceremonies to Noel . She would get all tangled up in theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumbled her way through ; and Noel all the while would nod brightly , saying that it was really terribly interesting . This happened over and over . ' Worst of all , however , was the absence of the Uncle . Until this year , Marjorie had not realized how central Samson-Aaron had been to the seder . Her father always had sat at the head of the table , as he sat now , conducting the service out of the beautifully illustrated Hagada printed in England . Samson-Aaron had seemed merely the funmaker , the heckler , of the feast . Now Marjorie saw that he had been nothing less than the soul of it ; and he was gone . He had warmed the air . Single-handed , he had dispelled the stiffness of a year 's separation , and the frost of all the permanent quarrels , of all the sad unchangeable differences in income . His bubbling jokes , his bellowing of the songs , his pounding of the rhythms with fist and foot , his cavorting , his fabulous eating and drinking , had gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties of blood to life , and welded the scattered estranged group , at least for the evening , into something like the close-knit tribal Family of the old country . Without him , the seder was but a moribund semblance ; and it was enacted with less and less heart as the evening went on , under the fixed smiles of Judge and Mrs. Ehrmann , and the cool observant eyes of their son . If anyone promised to save the seder as an institution , it was Neville Sapersteen . He was giving the occasion what liveliness it had . The children 's table was a vortex of noise and motion , all of it churning around Neville . Snatching the other children 's Pepsi-Cola , breaking matzos over their heads , drinking off the salt water , throwing plates , forks , pepper , flowers , hard-boiled eggs , Neville was exhibiting enough vivacity for ten children . His mother stayed one step behind him , as it were , catching the plates before they broke , putting back the flowers , wiping up the wine , comforting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them not to break matzos over Neville 's head , on the grounds that revenge was an unworthy motive . Marjorie 's back was to the living room , so that she missed much of the byplay ; but at every sudden burst of noise she would look around fearfully , to make sure that nothing jagged or wet was sailing her way . Matters broke out of control very suddenly in the living room , just as Mr. Morgenstern was putting down the three wrapped matzos after reciting This bread of affliction . There was an explosion of laughter and yammering , with Neville 's voice rising in infuriated soprano shrieks over the din . His mother yelled , " Morris , Morris , come quick ! The airplanes ! They 're into the airplanes ! " While Morris struggled frantically to get out of the seat where he was wedged between two fat aunts , half a dozen children came giggling and shrieking into the dining room , swooping toy airplanes in their hands and making noises like airplane motors  --  " Braah ! Braah " After them charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uttering hideous choked sounds . The children dived under the table and under chairs ; they flew between the legs of their pursuing parents , in and out of the clutching arms of Mildred and Morris Sapersteen , into the bedrooms and round and round the living room , all the time roaring " Braah ! Braahl " Neville did a remarkablep255simulation of running in fourteen directions at once , whimpering , screeching , and snapping his teeth . The seder stopped dead for ten minutes , while all the parents joined the chase . The airplanes were at last rounded up , and the children herded back to their chairs ; it was a difficult business , because they kept snatching new airplanes from the suitcase after being deprived of the ones they had , and galloping around again . Morris Sapersteen stood at bay in the middle of the living room , clutching the suitcase , while Mildred attempted to quiet Neville , who was lying on his back , kicking the floor with both heels , and yelling . Morris said , " I 'll just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , " Neville screamed . " I want the box open ! " His mother said , " There 's only one answer . These kids are impossible . You 'll have to hold the suitcase open on your lap . " " Gosh , Millie , how will I eat ? " " Look , Morris , it was n't my idea to come to this thing , it was yours . I warned you . " She led Neville off , and Morris stumbled back into his chair , and sat with the suitcase on his lap . Peace ensued ; but not for long . The next part of the seder was the reciting of the Four Questions . Essentiallythe seder was a sort of pageant , or religious drama , performed at home . The youngest child who could memorize Hebrew delivered four queries about the table symbols : the horseradish , the matzo , the salt water , and so forth : and the adults in reply chanted the tale of the Exodus from Egypt , explaining the symbols as the story unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her fourth to her eighth year . The Family had all said even then that she was a born little actress . This year the Questions were admirably performed in a sweet piping voice , in flawless parroted Hebrew , by Susan Morgenstern , a chubby six-year-old from the Newark branch of the family . She retired to the children 's table , after curtsying to the applause . The adults had hardly begun the concerted chant of the response when the most horrible imaginable scream rang out from the living room , and Neville 's mother was heard exclaiming , " Neville , that was cruel ! You 're not supposed to be cruel ! " Neville , it developed , had sneaked up in back of Susan Morgenstern and bitten her with all his might on the behind . Again the seder stopped while the four parents hurriedly unscrambled the children ; for Susan was rolling with Neville on the floor , trying to strangle him , and making fair headway . It happened that there was bad blood anyway between the Newark branch and the Far Rockaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument sprang up when Neville 's father tried to say that the bite had actually been a good thing . He said that Neville had gotten rid of the hostility naturally created by Susan 's spell in the limelight , and so in reality the bite had drawn the cousins closer . " Holy cow , Morris ! " exclaimed the father of Susan , a heavy good-natured young butcher named Harry . " If he bit her he bit her . But I 'll be goddamned if I 'll let you say it was a good thing , too . Why , for crying out loud , suppose all the other kids had  --  what 'd you call it ?  --  gottenp256rid of their goddamn hostility like him ? My girl would have been chewed to death . " " Harry , please , do n't curse at the seder table , " said Mrs. Morgenstern , smiling pathetically at the judge and his wife . " Perfectly natural , nothing to get excited about , " the judge said , craning his neck and watching the flailing Neville in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally aggressive , " his father said . " It 's the normal pattern of the only child , especially the insecure male . " " It 's not that at all , " his mother shouted angrily . She was squatting , trying to hold Neville still while she straightened his clothing . " It 's all this primitive magic and symbolism and Hebrew he 's being exposed to . It upsets his nerves . He 's been brought up rationally , and he 's at a stage where all this poppycock disturbs him deeply ! " Morris Sapersteen , fumbling at the open suitcase on his lap , glanced around at Mr. and Mrs. Morgenstern . " All right , Millie , there are other people here besides us , who think a little differently --  " " Oh , it 's all right . He 's got to be exposed to all these folkways sooner or later , I guess , but we might have waited a couple of years , that 's all . " The Family meantime , with all the excitement , had become a little livelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff gloom . Harry Morgenstern , Susan 's brawny father , sneaked himself a couple of drinks of the Palestinian plum brandy to calm his nerves . He immediately became very red in the face , and began to pound the table with his fists . " What the hell , people , is this a seder or a funeral ? Come on , put some life into it ! The judge here is going to think he 's in an old folks ' home ! " And he started to bawl a song , and several of the Family joined in. judge Ehrmann waved at him and laughed . " Do n't worry about me . I 'm thoroughly enjoying myself , I assure you . " " This is nothing , Your Honor , " Harry shouted . " We warm up a little , we 'll show you what a seder is all about ! Come on , Dora , come on , Leon  --  sing ! " Mr. Morgenstern said , " That 's the spirit , Harry , that 's what we need . You sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass with a fork , and after a moment broke into the song himself . Everybody sang . Mr. Morgenstern returned to the Hebrew chanting with more zest and heart , and the Family 's responses became stronger , too . Noel turned to Marjorie , his eyes lively . " Well , I begin to get the idea . " " Oh , this is nothing , " Marjorie said . Her spirits were rising . " This is a ghost of what it used to be . We used to have Samson-Aaron . " " I can imagine , " Noel said . " I 'm really beginning to understand him , a little bit  --  and you too , for that matter . " The seder continued to pick up momentum and gaiety , and soon it was more or less in the old swing . Harry the butcher showed some promise of leadership , bellowing and pounding with energy equal to the Uncle 's , if with less charm and flavor . Marjorie felt the familiar old warmth enveloping her . The sweet grape taste of the wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his parents were thinking , and she joined in the songs with abandon . She noticed that both Noel and his father had taken to reading the English translations in their Hagadas , watching the others to see when pages were turned . Noel looked to her at one point and said , " Do you understand all this Hebrew ? " " Well , fortunately , yes , we 've gone over and over it for so many years  --  otherwise my Hebrew is pretty rusty --  " Noel said , " The English is absolutely atrocious , at least this translation furnished by the matzo company is . But I do get a dim idea of what it 's all about . It has terrific charm and pathos , actually  --  and power , too . I rather envy you . " The ritual had arrived at another song , and as the family burst into it with gusto , Judge Ehrmann glanced up from the book , his high bald brow wrinkled . " Why , I believe I know that one , " he said to Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Shmulka nodded with delight . " Well ! " the judge said . " I guess that 's one that percolated through to the German Jews . My mother used to hum it to me when I was a baby . I remember it distinctly , though I have n't heard it in fifty years . " Waving a stiff extended finger high in the air , Judge Ehrmann joined in the song . The effect on the Family was tremendous . When the song ended Harry bawled , " Three cheers for the Judge ! " And the Family cheered , and gave him a round of applause . He bowed here and there with pleased dignity , his long face flushed , his gray fringe of hair a little disordered , a pulse throbbing in his neck . A crash of crockery from the living room now indicated that Neville Sapersteen was emerging from his doldrums . Marjorie looked over her shoulder , and saw Mildred Sapersteen on her hands and knees , picking up the pieces . Mildred caught her look and said angrily , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan is impossible . She keeps calling Neville Neville the Devil . ' No child with any brains would stand for that --  " Harry Morgenstern shouted into the living room , " Susan , you stop that , do you hear ? No more calling Neville Neville the Devil . ' Understand me ? " " Yes , Daddy , " piped Susan , and added , " Just one last time , all right , Daddy ? Neville the Devil ! " Now that it was officially forbidden , all the children took up the cry and bayed rhythmically , " Ne-ville the De-vil ! Ne-ville the De-vil ! Ne-ville the De-vil ! " Neville left his chair and catapulted into the dining room , yelling , " Daddy , I want my airplanes ! Give me my airplanes ! " Morris jumped up , forgetting that the suitcase was open on his lap ; the suitcase slipped , he clutched at it and upset it , and the forty-seven airplanes went clanking and tinkling all over the floor under the table . There was a moment of silence after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his father . " All right , " Mildred Sapersteen said in an icy tone . " Nice going , Morris . Now pick them all up . " " No , no , " screeched Neville , " I do n't want them picked up . Leave themp258there . I 've got to make a parade ! " He dived under the table and could be heard crawling , and sliding airplanes along the floor . " What 's he going to make ? " Mrs. Morgenstern said nervously to Mildred . " Get him out from under the table , please . " " A parade , " Mildred said . " He wo n't harm anything . He trust lines them up three abreast . In perfect formation . " " Mildred dear , " said Mrs. Morgenstern , " not under the table , please , with people 's feet and everything --  " Morris said , " Aunt Rose , if you want some peace and quiet , believe me this is the best idea . A parade absolutely absorbs him . You wo n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just ignore him and --  " At that moment Judge Ehrmann leaped to his feet with an incredibly loud snarl , upsetting his chair , clutching at his leg . " Aaarh ! MY GOD ! " " My parade ! You kicked my parade ! " Neville squealed from under the table . " Good heavens , " the judge choked , " the little monster has really bitten my ankle to the bone ! " He pulled up his trouser leg , peering anxiously at his thin bluish shank . Morris Sapersteen plunged under the table and pulled Neville out , thrashingand howling . " My airplanes ! My parade ! I want my parade ! " The whole table was in an uproar . The judge said to Morris , " Good Lord , man , forgive me for being blunt , but what that child needs is the whipping of his life . He needs it desperately . " " Morris ! " shrilled Mildred , glaring at the judge . " Let 's go home . " " Take it easy , Mildred , for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , I say ! Pick up the airplanes ! " " I 've got him , Millie , " Morris panted , still struggling with Neville , as with a large live salmon . Uncle Shrnulka said , " Mildred , dolling , do n't go home , it 's a seder . You did n't eat nothing yet . " He held out his arms to Neville . " Come to Grandpa , sveetheart . " Neville with astonishing readiness stopped writhing , slid from his father 's arms into little Shmulka 's lap , and nestled . The judge edged slightly away . " There , Mildred , everything 's fine , " Shmulka said . " He 'll sit vit me and be good . For Grandpa , he 's alvays good . " " Oh no , I 'm not going to have that again . " Mildred 's mouth was a black line , her brows were pulled in a scowl . " That lulling is all wrong , and that grandfather-fixation business is really sick , and I 'm not having it in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go . " She folded her arms and leaned in the doorway . The children behind her were still . Morris looked around with a smile , his eyes big and sad . " Sorry , folks , I think it 's best , maybe . " He dropped on his hands and knees , and knocked and shuffled under the table . Mildred was standing almost directly behind Marjorie . Impulsively getting out of her chair , Marjorie put her arm around Mildred 's waist . " Millie ; you 're right to be upset . But I think you 'll be more upset , and Morris certainlywill be , if you walk out now . It 's only another hour --  " she faltered.  |p259Mildred  Sapersteen 's eyes , curiously flat and shiny as they looked into hers , horrified her . Mildred said , " Marjorie dear , you 're very sweet and pretty , and you 've got everything in the world , I know , but I 've just got a son , and I 've got to do what 's best for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a goddamned pill . She 's enjoyingthis . " Mildred whirled , glared at Harry , then looked around at the table . " Well ! Thank God we live in a time when you can pick and choose your own culture . Nobody can say I have n't tried to cooperate , but this mumbo-jumbo is impossible , and Neville senses it , and I 've always said so . If I have anything to say , we 'll wind up joining the Unitarian Church . They have all the answers , anyway . " There was a horrid silence . " All right , Morris . Get the baby and let 's go . " Uncle Shmulka said in a small tired voice , " He fell asleep . " Neville indeed , the storm center of the wrangle , was curled in a ball in his grandfather'slap , eyes closed , breathing peacefully . The last thing Morris said after fumbling goodbyes , as he carried the slumbering boy out of the room , was , " Papa , she did n't mean that about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , Morris , I know you 're not . She 's a good girl , she 's upset . Be veil , " said Uncle Shmulka . As Morris trudged out of sight one of the children called out halfheartedly , " Neville the Devil . " Mrs. Morgenstern said to the Ehrmanns , " I do n't know what you must think of us . " Judge Ehrmann smiled , and his voice was deep and soothing . " You should see our family get-togethers , Rose . When blood does n't flow , it 's considered dull . Now I know you 've got a big happy family . " He had not used her first name before . Mrs. Morgenstern glowed , and the drawn countenances all around the table relaxed . Harry Morgenstern said , By God , Judge , you 're right . We do have a big happy family . There 's one of those in every family , and to hell with her . Come on , Aunt Rose , we 're through with the Hagada , are n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious feast : chopped chicken liver , stuffed fish , fat beet soup , matzo balls , chicken fricassee , potato pancakes , fried chicken and fried steaks . Judge Ehrmann went at the food with startling enthusiasm , saying there was nothing in the world that he loved like Jewish cooking . The relatives , who had been fearing that they would have to eat daintily in the judge 's presence , fell to joyously . Soon everybody was very merry except Aunt Dvosha , who sat nibbling at a platter of dry chopped-up carrots , lettuce , tomatoes , raw potatoes , and apples . She had recently given up cooked vegetables , on the grounds that vitamins were destroyed by heat . As she looked around at seventeen people stuffing themselves with vast quantities of fried meat , her face became long and gloomy , and she grumbled to herself , and to whoever would listen to her , about stomach linings , amino acids , protein poisoning , and sudden death.  |p260The  judge began glancing at his watch when the dessert came . After finishinghis second cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on top of his napkin , and cleared his throat . The gesture and the single sound were enough to make all the guests stop eating and drinking , and turn their faces toward him . " My dear Rose and Arnold , Mrs. Ehrmann and I certainly regret that we have to leave this warm and lovely family circle , and these beautiful ceremonies , and this marvelous food , and go to a dull political dinner , the kind of thing I have to do almost every night in the week , but I can't --  " " It 's perfectly all right , Judge , " Mrs. Morgenstern said , not quite realizing that this was a preamble rather than conversation . The judge rolled over her smoothly with a smile , "  --  but I ca n't , I say , leave this sumptuous , and may I say sacred , table without a word of appreciation . " Noel slumped . His eyes dulled , and his face was so morose that Marjorie was afraid others would notice . But all eyes were on the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 've eaten Rose Morgenstern'sfood . And I 'm even more grateful for the spiritual food I 've received tonight . Mrs. Ehrmann and I are n't religious people in any formal sense , I 'm afraid , but I trust in all our actions we 've always showed ourselves good Jews at heart . You see , we 're both descended from the old German families who have pretty well dropped all that . Sitting here tonight , I asked myself , were my grandfathers really so wise ? Twentieth-century psychology has some very complimentary things to say , you know , about the power of symbol and ceremony over the conduct of men . And I wonder whether it is n't going to turn out that these old-time rabbis knew best . The marvelous warmth and intimacy of your ceremonies tonight ! Even the little family quarrel only made things more lively . It gave the evening  --  well , tang . I was going to say bite , but I 'd better not . " He paused skillfully for the laugh . " The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been a revelation to me . I 've suddenly realized , all over again , that I 'm part of a tradition and culture that go back four thousand years . I 've realized that it was we Jews , after all , with the immortal story of the Exodus from Egypt , who gave the world the concept of the holiness of freedom --  " " Oh lawks a mercy me , " Noel muttered . " Shut up , " Marjorie whispered angrily . " But somehow , " the judge said , " your seder has done more than even that for me . Somehow I 've almost seen the Exodus come alive tonight . While you 've chanted the Hebrew , which regrettably I do n't understand , I 've closed my eyes and seen the great hordes of Israel , with the majestic gray-bearded giant , Moses , at their head , marching forth from the granite gates of Rameses into desert sands by the light of the full moon . . . . " Judge Ehrmann proceededin this vein for perhaps ten minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation on Sinai . The relatives sat spellbound . Marjorie , for all of Noel 's sarcastic mutterings , was thrilled and amazed . Noel had described his father as a ridiculous windbag ; but actually , though his language was flowery and his manner magisterial , the judge had eloquence and humor . Describing the Israelites heaping their ornaments before Aaronp261for the making of the golden calf , he said , " Earrings , finger rings , ankle rings , nose rings , gold , gold , in a clinking , tumbling , mounting pile ! Just picture it ! They stripped themselves bare ! They gave away their last treasures for this folly , this golden calf , these impoverished Israelites with the light of Sinai still on their faces !  --  And to this day , my friends , a Jew , no matter how poor , will always dig up ten dollars for a pinochle game . " The relatives roared , and the older men nudged each other and winked . The judge sat quietly , waiting for the laugh to die , his eyes alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbing , and Marjorie was forcibly struck by his resemblance to his son . Noel , too , never laughed at his own jokes , but sat solemnly , timing his pauses to the laughter of his hearers . The deep-set clever blue eyes were identical in the two men , now that the judge 's were roused into vigor . The gap of age , and Noel 's smooth handsomeness and mass of blond hair , could not hide the fact that he was , after all , his father 's son . And as Noel sat sunk low in his chair , staring at a wine stain on the tablecloth , and slowly crumbling a hill of matzo crumbs over it while his father talked , Marjorie could see him sitting so at his father 's table from perhaps his thirteenth year onward , sullenly enduring eclipse . One thing was obvious : at a table where Judge Ehrmann dominated , there were no other attractions . When he rose to go , after finishing his talk with , "  --  and now goodbye , God bless you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowding toward him , offering their hands , chorusing compliments . He had a handshake and a word for everybody . He remembered which children belonged to which parents , and mentioned them by name in making his farewells , a feat which stunned all with delight . Mr. and Mrs. Morgenstern accompanied the Ehrmanns to the foyer , and several of the guests followed , still exchanging jokes with the judge . Noel 's mother , a richly dressed small wraith of a woman , with makeup a little too pink , stopped to kiss Noel on the forehead , and then she kissed Marjorie . " You have a lovely family , Marjorie dear , really lovely . You 're a girl to be envied . Good night . I wish we could stay . " Marjorie said , when she was gone , " I think your mother 's a darling . And your father 's charming , too . Why did you paint him to me as such an idiot ? " He glanced briefly at her with a dip of the head , and a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that speech , by some chance ? " " I thought it was moving , I do n't care what you say . " " Really ? Just remember , dear , he 's a politician , and your house is in his district . When will this thing be over ? Can I take this off ? " He reached for the skullcap . " Well , the ceremony starts up again now , Noel , and some of the best songs come --  " " How much longer ? " " Oh , not much , not even an hour . I appreciate that you 've been very patient  --  " " Well , it 's been interesting , but frankly I do have the idea now . " She said at once , " Noel , it 's perfectly all right if you want to leave now . Everybody will understand . "  | " I 'll settle for some more of that Palestine brandy . " He poured a stiff drink  --  he had been drinking brandy steadily since the dessert  --  swallowed half of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rough , not quite civilized . Primitive , potent , exotic . Well suited to the occasion . " The change in tone was marked when the seder resumed . The glory was departed . The guests were all stuffed with food , and sleepy with wine and brandy , and more interested in talking about the wonderful judge than in following the ceremony . Mr. Morgenstern had to rap for quiet several times . There soon ensued a lot of glancing toward Noel and Marjorie among the Family , with winks , and nods , and whispers . Marjorie began to be uneasy . The rite that came next was the traditional occasion for teasing sweethearts and engaged couples . Noel , oblivious , was leafing through the Hagada in a bored way , sipping plum brandy . Even Aunt Dvosha became lively and gay , whispering across the two vacant chairs to Uncle Shmulka . The arch faces she made at Marjorie would have frightened an alligator . In the expectant quiet that settled over the table , Uncle Harry said , " Okay , who opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing at Marjorie . Noel looked up . " What on earth --  ? " he said mildly . " This is it , Noel , " Harry said . " The door 's got to be opened , you know . " There was more laughter . Noel said , " For whom ? " " Elijah , the prophet Elijah . Do n't you know ? Elijah comes in now and drinks his cup of wine . " Noel said , " Well , he 's no friend of mine , but I 'll be glad to open the door . " At the howls of mirth that followed , he turned to Marjorie . " Was that funnier than I thought ? " " Margie and Noel open the door , " squealed Aunt Dvosha , and collapsed on the table , laughing . Noel said , " I begin to understand . . . . Well , let 's go . " He took her hand and stood amid ribald guffaws . Marjorie , completely scarlet-faced , said , " It means nothing at all , nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some nonsense about making a wish , but a boy and a girl are supposed to go together . " " Well , " Noel said , as she halted in the hallway . " Do we open it now ? " " No . One moment . " A chant began in the dining room . " Now . Go ahead , open the door . " With a wry smile , Noel did so . The empty tiled outside hall , and the rows of doors , looked strange . He glanced at her . " Damned if I did n't feel a cool wind on my cheek . The power of suggestion --  " " I 've felt that wind every year since I was four , " Marjorie said . " How long does Elijah stay ? " " Just for a minute . " " Am I supposed to kiss you , really ? " " Not at all . Skip it , by all means . " He kissed her lightly . He had drunk a lot of brandy ; he smelled of it . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , draped over his arm .  | " Margie , make my excuses to your folks , will you ? I 'm going out on the town with the prophet Elijah . " She stared at him . He said , " Really , it 's best . They 're sweet people , and I 've had a wonderful time , the judge 's oration notwithstanding . It 's been a revelation to me , really it has . But I think at this point I 'd better run along . " She said faintly , " It 's probably an excellent idea . Goodbye . " " I 'll call you , " he said . He looked at the empty air in the hall . " Elijah , wait for baby ! " The door closed . She did n't become uneasy until three days had gone by without a call from him . It was n't possible this time , somehow , to telephone him in the freeand-easyway she was growing used to ; not after his abrupt departure from the seder . She was n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well during a very trying evening , she thought , and the outcome might have been far worse ; still , his manner of leaving had been a rebuff of a sort , and the next move had to come from him . It was only on the fourth morning that she woke wondering whether she had misjudged him , after all ; whether he was actually a shallow snob , capable of thinking less of her because she had poor relatives , and a few strange ones like Aunt Dvosha and the Sapersteens . It was a relief when the phone rang at ten after eleven , the time he almost always , for some reason , chose to call her from the office . " Miss Morgenstern ? One moment , please . " It was the cold correct voice of the Paramountswitchboard operator . " Hello ? Marjorie ? How are you ? " " Why  --  why hello , Mr. Rothmore . . . Sam . . . I 'm fine , thank you  --  gosh , what a surprise ( " " Hope I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you think of me ? I 've been up for hours --  " " Thought you might have acquired the habits of our no-good friend , a little bit . Where is he , by the way , do you know ? " " Is n't he at the office ? " " Has n't been here for three days , and his phone does n't answer . " Marjorie said with impulsive alarm , " He must be sick . " " Have you seen him or heard from him in the past three days ? " " Monday night was the last I saw him . " " Is that so ? Well , Tuesday morning he did n't show up . I do n't think he 's sick . I sent a messenger down to his apartment yesterday . Place was dark . No answer to the bell . He 's off somewhere , nobody knows where . " " Why Sam , it 's  --  it 's very strange that he 'd just go off , without telling your office . " " Goddamn strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margie , what are you doing for lunch ? Come down and have lunch with me. "  | " Why --  " She thought frantically for a moment about clothes . " Why , of course . I 'd love to , Sam . " She immediately called Noel and let the telephone ring and ring . He had a trick , when he did n't want to be disturbed , of unscrewing the base of the phone and wadding up the bell with paper . He had fixed it that way during the two weeks he had rewritten Princess Jones , and she had sat in his apartmentlaughing at the dull little angry buzz it made . The noise was irritating , and if it went on long enough he would occasionally take the receiver off the hook . But this time the ringing continued until it got on her nerves , and she slammed down the receiver . She dressed quickly in an old blue suit , making several last-minute changes of hats and costume jewelry . She had not seen Rothmore before at his desk , in his huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark , the carpeting very thick underfoot , and there were many modern paintings richly framed on the wall . He got up slowly , holding out his hand . The severe look he had darted from under his brows at the opening door faded to a pleasant tired smile . " Hello . Heard from our vanished friend since I talked to you ? " " No . " " Messenger boy just went down and tried to kick the door in . No luck . Come with me . I 'd like to show you something . " He led her to a small office facing out on Times Square , with two desks in it . " Noel shares this office with another man . Here 's his desk . He left it open Monday . I had to dig into it this morning for some correspondence that 's overdue . " One after another he pulled out the drawers . They were overflowing with jumbled papers , books , letters , printers ' galleys , copies of The Hollywood Reporter and other trade papers , office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk job , all in an unbelievably slovenly chaos . There were some half-eaten stale sandwiches and a few empty Coca-Cola bottles . Marjorie stared , speechless . Rothmore said , " I do n't know how he did it . Except maybe by emptying his wastebasket into the desk every day since he 's been here  --  or all the wastebaskets of Paramount , more likely . " He shut the drawers with contemptuous backhand thrusts . " Well , I 'm glad he 's been doing something to earn his keep . The wastebaskets should be emptied , though not necessarily by story editors . " Marjorie faltered , " I thought he was doing pretty well . . . . Rothmore looked at her over his thick glasses . " Let 's go get some coffee . " Over exquisite cold salmon in a small French restaurant , he told her the story of Noel 's career at Paramount . She was at once fascinated and repelled by the disclosures , and her nerves were shaken . Rothmore was not bitter , but he was not kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarcastic anecdotes . After the glimpse of the desk drawers , Marjorie could hardly hide from herself where the truth probably lay . According to Rothmore , Noel had been lazy and insolent from the first day . He had been rebellious before there was anything to rebel against ; and his resentment had been directed not at anything in his own job , but at the entire process of business . " I mean , Margie , the man would say things like , Naturally , we 've got to make sure our pictures show a profit , ' in a sneering tone . As though it were some god/damn guilty secret that a business has to make a profit . Childish , you know , unless a person 's a communist , and he 's no communist , I managed to make pretty sure of that . But I 'm damned if I know what 's eating the man . I mean , why ? Why the petty lies ? Why the inefficiency ? He 's one of the cleverestfellows I 've ever met , but he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so disorderly . He 'd lie about the most trivial things , get me in silly jams  --  you know , saying he 'd answered a letter , or sent back a set of galleys , when he had n't . When it caught up with him , he 'd say in the airiest way that the thing had slipped his mind , or some stupid answerlike that . Totally irresponsible . Why , today I found in his desk letters , important letters , he should have showed me , weeks old . It is n't normal , Marjorie . No man is that lousy . He had to work at it , to be that bad . Now , why ? " Marjorie said miserably , " Maybe he is n't cut out for business , that 's all . He was very efficient at South Wind , staging shows . A lot of creative people just ca n't stand business . " " Well , my answer to that ought to be , why did he take Paramount 's money ? But I 'll skip that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He 's got a fine grasp of pictures , and I mean a business grasp . For some perverse reason he kept taking the high artistic tone , I guess because that made it easy to insult me , but I 'd put him up against anybody to analyze a story property  --  a musical , a novel , a farce , anything  --  for its basic values . Why , he pulled a story out of an obscure magazine that we bought for twelve hundred , and I 'm bound to tell you if he did n't do anything else all year he earned his keep with it . We 're making a big A picture of it . And I told him so , and gave him a bonus . Maybe that was my mistake . But I was trying everything , you see . I tried being tough . I tried being nice . I tried giving him his head . I tried riding him . Hell , all I was after was to straighten him out . Nothing helped . From the day he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pouting one minute , charming the next , smart as a whip today , stupider than the most idiotic clerk tomorrow , fast as a snake , slow as molasses , blow hot , blow cold , the most aggravating man I 've ever encountered . I 'm a pretty stubborn customer , Marjorie , and I do n't as a rule start anything I ca n't finish , but this has beaten me . I 'm all through with Noel Airman . " Rothmore sipped his coffee , lit a cigar , and sat staring at her from under his brows , taking little gulps of air . He seemed to be waiting for her to plead Noel 's case . She found nothing to say . There was a panicky undercurrentto the speed and hunger with which she went on devouring her food , shaking her head gloomily at Rothmore 's story . He said after a while , " Well what do you think ? You must know him better than anybody . " " Sam , he 's a total enigma to me , a black mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him . " " It 's none of my business , but have you been giving him a bad time ? A girl can mess up a man 's work , like nothing else . " She faced him . " That 's not it . Take my word for it . " " Well , maybe he 's just no good , as he keeps saying . I ca n't say he has n't pretty well proved his point . "  | " What do you think of his songs , Sam , really ? " " His songs ? " " That 's what he 's really interested in , after all . " Rothmore said , " There 's no comparison , none at all , between where he could go as an executive and as a songwriter . " " But obviously he does n't care about being an executive . " Rothmore puffed at his cigar . " Look , he 's past thirty . He 's a competent songwriter , pretty competent , but frankly they 're a dime a dozen . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building crowd . They 're ignoramuses , lowbrows , neurotic bums , these fellows who write an occasional hit song . I 'm not talking about a Johnny Mercer , a Cole Porter . He is n't that , or he would have shown the form long ago . If you ask me , he writes songs with his fingertips , the way he does everything else . I do n't know what the trouble is . I 'm no psychoanalyst . Maybe he 's so afraid of being a failure he wo n't put his back into anything , so he can always tell himself that he 's never really tried . I have a brother like that . I started him in four different businesses . He was always my mother 's darling , but he 's never earned an honest dollar . He can whistle all the themes from Beethoven 's quartets . My brother Leo . Never married . Hangs around with the Philharmonic musicians . " Rothmore motioned to the waiter for the check . " More coffee ?  --  I 'll tell you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Face . What ruins him , probably , is these occasionalhits . If he 'd only fail completely at it , he 'd concentrate on something with a future . But your friend 's curse , Margie , I 'm afraid , is that he never fails completely at anything . He 's got too much ability for that . " " I 've told him over and over he 's got to concentrate on one thing . " Marjoriecould not keep the heartsickness out of her voice . " Has he showed you his musical comedy , Princess Jones ? " " No . " " Well , I think it 's brilliant , Sam , I really do . He 's had awful luck . I 'm not trying to excuse him , but  --  " She told Rothmore of the misfortune with the producer Kogel . He moved a shoulder disparagingly . " That 's the theatre business . You 've got to be able to take such knocks . Still , if you say this show 's good , maybe it is . He has remarkable ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " He talks a lot about you . Pretends to laugh at you , but  --  he 's damned selfish , but I do think he 's in love with you . You 're his hope , if he has any . " " I ca n't imagine what 's happened to him , Sam . I 'm going to find him , one way or another . " Rothmore helped her from her chair . " Margie , I said I 'm stubborn , and I am . If you can get him to promise you that he 'll start afresh , and really try , I 'll forget about this little vacation , and take him back . It 's got to be a promise to you . Otherwise  --  " He shrugged . " He 's an attractive young man , God knows , but there 's just so much time you can waste trying to straighten out one bent pin . " When they parted on the street , Rothmore said , " He owes me money . Not much , but he was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's bothering him , tell him to come back and stop being such a damned baby . We 'll workp267out an easy way to pay it off , five dollars a week deducted from his check , or something . " This upset her more than anything else he had told her . Noel 's window was open slightly at the bottom , and the Venetian blind was drawn up . This was as much as Marjorie could see from the street . She rang the outer bell . Surprisingly , there was an immediate answering buzz , and the hallway door yielded to a push . She went up the dimly lit stairs , full of an indefinable fear . She seemed to be seeing the torn blue linoleum on the steps , and smelling the incense odors from the ground-floor apartment , for the first time . Every detail of the staircase stood out  --  the old-fashioned moldingalong the wall , the dirty Victorian balustrade , the extinct gas jet near the top , below the single dim light bulb . She rounded the top of the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his door at the end of the hallway was shut . She walked to it and rang the bell . The girl was taller than Marjorie , and dressed in a blue housecoat . She seemed pretty , but it was hard to tell because the light of the window was directly behind her . She said , " Oh ! " and then , " I was expecting a boy with groceries . " The two girls looked at each other . Marjorie could hear water drumming in the bathroom . She said in a pleasant calm tone , " Is Noel Airman here ? " The girl said , " Are you Marjorie ? " " Yes . I 'm Marjorie . " " Well , come in . He 's taking a shower . He 'll be right out . " The bed was neatly made , and the room looked as it always did , except for the new calfskin suitcase open in the corner , overflowing with pretty white and pink lingerie . The girl went to the bathroom , pounded a fist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Marjorie 's here . " She smiled at Marjorie with easy good humor . She was redheaded , and lusciously attractive . The water stopped running , and Noel 's voice called , " What ? " The girl said , " Marjorie'shere , I tell you . " There was a silence . Then Noel shouted cheerily , " Fine . Give her some coffee . I 'll be right out . " The water gushed again . " Sit down , honey , and take your coat off . Coffee 's just hotting up . I 'm Imogene Normand . " The girl stood with her hands in her housecoat pockets , smiling down at Marjorie , who was tensed in the armchair , her coat flung back from her shoulders . " Do n't start throwing things at Noel when he comes out . I landed in New York without five dollars to my name , and Noel let me park here . He 's been staying on the fourth floor with his painter friend , the fellow with the beard , Van something . He comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Imogene said this with such offhand pleasant sincerity , with such utter absence of embarrassment or guile , that Marjorie 's muscles relaxed slightly , and she even smiled . " Well , I 'm glad you told me . I was going to stab him with the bread knife . You 're awfully pretty . " Imogene threw her head back and laughed . " Thanks , but you 're one girl who has nothing to fear . " She glanced appreciatively , professionally , at Mar/jorie . " Well , he has good reason . You 're terribly sweet . " The boiling over of the coffee interrupted Marjorie 's answer . Imogene called from behind the screen that hid Noel 's tiny pantry and gas burner , " Cream ? Sugar ? " " Black . " " Ah , a coffee lover , like me . " She brought out two steaming cups . Marjorie noticed that there were no rings on the girl 's bony hands . " Are you  --  are you the Imogene Noel told me about ? The one who married an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oil man , of sorts . ' We 've busted up . I 'm back looking for work . " " Oh . I 'm sorry . " " Nothing to be sorry about . One of those things . Fun while it lasted , and all that , " Imogene said gaily . She sipped , crouching over the cup . She had slant eyes and a charming slow smile ; one of those lucky girls , Marjorie thought , who walked around inside a body like jewelers ' work , every detail perfect , and none of it her own doing . It was like being born rich . Her legs through the slit of the housecoat were dazzlingly long and lovely . She had minimized her one defect , a big jaw , by piling the beautiful red hair full on the head , rouging the cheeks high , and broadening the mouth a bit beyond the natural line . There was a faint coarseness about Imogene . Perhaps it lay in the very excellence of makeup , the shrewdness of hair arrangement . Marjorie 's eyes kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'm getting out of here tomorrow , so friend Noel wo n't be dispossessed any more . I did n't want to get involved in hotel bills , you know , before I was sure I had work . " " I suppose you do modelling . " " Well , I 'm more a singer , really , but the modelling pays the bills , you might say . Gosh , things are awful in this town . I thought Roosevelt was supposed to fix the depression . Why , I 've never seen it so dead . Will you excuse me , honey , while I finish dressing ? I 'm late . " " Go right ahead . " Imogene 's slip , her shoes , her stockings , were all expensive and smart . Nothing could have been more conservative , yet more designed to set off her voluptuous figure , than the hand-tailored black suit and the mannish black hat . She put on her clothes with little waste motion , chattering about her singing career , the unreliability of coaches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the night-club trade . Dressed , she somehow looked coarser than before . She rapped at the bathroom door . " Hey , have you drowned ? I 'm off . " The door opened and Noel looked out , unshaven and pale , dressed in moccasins , corduroy pants , and his old black turtle-neck sweater . He said , " What are you going to do about breakfast ? Hi , Marge . " " Oh , I 'll get a bite uptown . I 'm late . That kid never did come with the butter and eggs . I thought that 's who Marjorie was , but it was n't . " " Had I known , I 'd have brought some , " Marjorie said . She was watching them like a detective , trying to guess from inflections , gestures , and looksp269what had really been happening in this apartment for four days . She was sick with tension . Her arms tingled ; her fingers were cold as a dead man 's . " It 's just as well , " Noel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit like eggs , and I know exactly what I do want . I want some whiskey and oysters . " Imogene laughed . " You ! I thought you 'd gotten over those habits . Whiskey and oysters ! " She turned to Marjorie . " How about that for a breakfast ?  --  By the way , Noel , I 've already explained to Margie that you 're sleeping upstairs with Van Renheim while I use your place . So she wo n't be breaking the crockery over your head . " Noel grinned , glancing at Marjorie . " Why did you do that ? You should have let her stew . Jealousy 's good for some girls . " " Well , I 've got my reputation to think about now , you know , being an old married woman with a kid , and all . Though I must say , now that I 'm back , it all seems like a dream . Well --  " She opened the door . " Nice meeting you , Margie . ' Bye , Noel , hope you enjoy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing you 've got company , you bum . See you tonight , maybe . Let 's see , have I got the key ? Yes . ' Bye . " The door closed . Noel and Marjorie confronted each other across the familiar room . The scent of Imogene 's hyacinth perfume drifted in the air between them . Noel leaned in the doorway of the bathroom with a yawn and a smile . " Well , how are you ? Can I offer you a matzo ? " " Do n't be so clever . " " I mean it . I have them . " He brought a box of matzos from behind the screen , and rattled it at her . " I 've been eating ' em , fried with eggs and sausages , all week . Developed a great yen for them at your house . How about some more coffee and a matzo ? Damn kid never did come with the butter . " " No , thanks . I see what you meant about Imogene . She 's really beautiful , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three years in Oklahoma have made her pretty leathery , to my taste , and duller than ever . But she 's a good kid . " He yawned again , and slumped on the bed . " I 'm really falling apart . Even a cold shower does nothing to me , just makes my lips blue and leaves me sleepy . " " Have n't you had enough sleep ? " " Very little , past four days . Been on a reading and writing jag . These things happen to me . " " Is that why you have n't been at Paramount ? I thought you must be sick . " He looked amused . " Has Sam been after you ? " " I 've just come from lunch with him . " " Gad ! The Save-Noel-from-Himself Club in emergency session . Well , what 's the diagnosis ? Rigor mortis of the conscience ? I 'm hungry as hell . Come on , let 's go out and eat . Oh , you just had lunch . Well , watch me eat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threadbare brown overcoat , and regarded himself wryly in the mirror . " Are you sure you want to be seen with such a tramp ? " " You 've looked better , I 'll say that --  " The telephone buzzed at that moment , a faint frustrated noise . They  |p270glanced  at each other . It buzzed again and again . Marjorie , putting on her coat , said , " Are n't you going to answer it ? " " There 's nobody I want to hear from  --  now that you 're with me , my love . Who can it be ? Sam , or my folks . Let it ring . " " Funny , " she said , staring at the buzzing phone . " What now ? " " If Imogene 's using the apartment , what 's the point of muffling the bell ? " His wide-eyed blank look lasted only a second . He burst out laughing . " Skip it , will you ? If Imogene and I were living in sin , she 'd tell you or I would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all day and half the night on her rounds , or whatever queer things she does . I still work down here . I 've been working like a dog , eighteen hours a day . " " Doing what ? " " Writing something that will shake the world . Come along , I 'll tell you about it . " Marjorie felt absurdly like a movie character snooping for clues at a murderscene . There were ashtrays on the night tables at either side of the bed . They had not recently been emptied . In the ashtray on the side near the window , the butts were all red with lipstick . In the other ashtray the butts were white . Both trays were equally full . " Do you know you 're standing there like a sleepwalker ? " Noel said . " Come on , I 'm starving . " It was impossible to ask him about the ashtrays . It was too low , too humiliating ; it was comical . She could grin , thinking about it . And yet she was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and down the stairs . " Gad , smell this air ! " Noel stood at the top of the street steps , breathing deeply . " Who 's growing jonquils on Eleventh Street ? Why did n't you tell me it was so warm ? I do n't need a coat . " " I do n't think it 's warm , " Marjorie said . " I 'm cold . " " Another April , " Noel said . He took her arm and they walked down the steps . " You know , there 's nothing to do in New York , really , when the year turns like this . People just let it happen , and go about their business , in and out of the turnstiles . In Paris , or even in Mexico City , it would be a kind of holiday . Everybody 'd be out strolling , young couples kissing on street corners , pushcarts with flowers everywhere --  " " I think I prefer the New York style , " Marjorie said . " I like to do my kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole process , public or private , " Noel said . " If you could back God into an argument in a restaurant  --  as you 're about to back me  --  you 'd want to know why He could n't think of a less messy way to keep the race going . " " I 'm not eager for any arguments , Noel . In fact why do n't you just havep271breakfast somewhere by yourself ? I 'll go home . I came down here because I thought you might be sick . " " Okay , you go on home . That 's a good idea . I 've got a lot of thinking to do . " " About us ? " " No , indeed . About my work . " " What are you working on , more songs ? " " No , something else . " " Look , whatever it is , if it 's so important that you have to take time off from work , do n't you think out of common courtesy you ought to let Sam Rothmore know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an old story . " He paused in front of a little French restaurant in the cellar of a brownstone house . " They make fine onion omelets , and the bread is real bread . . . But I want those oysters . Come on . " She said after walking in silence , " You should know better than anybody in the world that I do n't regard sex as something messy . That 's a vile thing to say to me . " " Do n't let it rankle . It was just a bum joke . " " You 're being very strange . " " Am I ? I was n't aware of it . This breeze , this April breeze . . . it has the edge of a scythe in it . Time 's passing , baby , did you know that ? You 're a big girl . Little Marjorie 's all gone . Dr. Shapiro , where art thou ? Here 's where I 'm having breakfast . Are you going home ? " " Why  --  it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They have very good oysters . " The wan sunlight on his face showed a few gray bristles in the blond stubble on his cheek . She had never noticed them before . He needed a haircut . He grinned at her scrutiny , stoop-shouldered , his thick long hair stirring in the breeze . " Debating whether to sit down in public with this panhandler , hey ? " " Maybe I 'll come in for a little while . " " Well , what a pleasant surprise . " He led her through the saloon , where a couple of morose men in overalls were drinking beer , to a back room , and sat on a bench under the window at a little table covered by a soiled red and white checked cloth . " Could n't ask for more privacy , could you , for giving me a going-over ? " " What is this place ? " Marjorie looked around with distaste at the bare brown-painted walls , the disorderly tables and chairs , the naked lamps , and the cardboard beer advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strong . " I thought I knew all your haunts --  " An old fat woman came from the barroom , wiping her hands on her apron . Noel ordered oysters and a double Canadian whiskey , and the woman waddled out . " Good Lord , I thought you were fooling . You ca n't have that for breakfast , " Marjorie said . " You 'll kill yourself . Have some cornflakes or some-thing . " " Best breakfast in the world , " Noel said . " Cornflakes , if you want to know ,  |p272are  what 's poisoning America , and causing the rise in mental disorders . You know what cornflakes are , do n't you ? Did n't I ever tell you how cornflakes got started ? " She was not in the mood for one of his crazy improvisations , though usuallyshe found them very funny . " No , but I wish you 'd order some cornflakesright now , if you can get them in this hole , instead of whiskey and oysters . " " Well , dear , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big flour mills . There was this pile of refuse big as a mountain in the yard of that mill , the waste products of years , and years , and years , of milling . Well , there came a knock on the door of the president of this mill 's office . When he went to open it , there was this little ragged old man outside . He had a long bushy beard stained with tobacco juice , and a tattered old burlap sack over his shoulder . And this old man whined , all scrunched over , Mister , can I please have some of that junk off that pile in your back yard ? ' The president said , I do n't know what you want it for . Hogs refuse to eat it . But sure , you 're welcome to it , all you want . ' The old man said , Okay , mister , I sure thank you . That 's all I wanted to hear . ' He straightened up and walked into the yard , tearing off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old  --  and he took out a whistle and blew it . In about five seconds a fleet of a hundred and forty-seven wagons drawn by dray horses came galloping into that yard . Margie , they cleared away that mountain of rubbish before you could have smoked a cigarette . They did n't leave a grain . That eighteen-year-old boy became the cornflakes king . When he died he owned that flour mill and four more besides . He left seven billion dollars in cash to his wife . In fact , he was the finest example of the hard-fisted young American industrialist anybody has ever seen . We all ought to be more like him , especially me , instead of coming late to work , and eating whiskey and oysters for breakfast . Nevertheless , and you can stand me up against a wall and shoot me if you want , I do n't give a good goddamn for cornflakes , and I never will . " The woman had returned and was setting the whiskey and oysters in front of him . " Ah , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how it happened that Imogene Normand opened my door this morning , instead of me . I feel you 're entitled to this explanation . " " What 's the matter with you ? " Marjorie said . Noel was drinking the rye neat . " I 'm beginning to think that is n't your first drink today . " " No indeed , " Noel said , " but I trust I 'm coherent . " " Well , yes , very much so , only a little too gay or something , all things considered . " Noel dipped two oysters at once in horseradish and tomato sauce , and ate them . " Exquisite . I was dying for these . " " Lord , you must be hungry . " He was cramming a handful of oyster crackers into his mouth . " That cornflakes story is very interesting , dear , but I do n't quite see how it explains everything about Imogene . " " Do n't you ? " " No . Not that it matters . I think it 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like that , but I 'm not surprised . You 're always painting yourself blacker than you are . " He stopped wolfing the oysters , and looked narrowly at her . " You know , you 're always saying I 'm a mystery , but you 're twice as mysterious to me . You absolutely baffle me . I 've known you intimately for a year , and I 'm still not sure whether you 're incredibly naive or as smart as a snake . " " What have you been working on , Noel ? Or do n't you want to talk about it ? " He lit a cigarette and idly picked up a greasy box from the bench . It was full of chess pieces . He pulled out a black knight and the white king , and placed them in the red and white squares on the tablecloth so that the knight was attacking the king . " I like this place . Most evenings and some afternoons you can pick up a chess game with one Village character or another  --  a boozed-up poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or just a plain precious nobody with an avant-garde magazine under his arm . The talk is more interesting than the chess . I bait them . You 'd swear I was all worked up over Kafka , or John Strachey , or Alfred Adler , or whatever , and all the time I 'm fighting to keep from rolling off the bench laughing . It 's a great diversion when you 're dull . " " You enjoy that kind of thing because you 're such a horrible intellectual snob , " Marjorie said . " You like to see the little creatures crawling at your feet . " " Do you really want to know what I 've been working on ? " " I 'm dying to know . " He put his hand on the back of her neck , and caressed her briefly . His eyes were very bright . " I wish  --  well , no use wishing , is there ? " He picked up the whiskey . " You 're responsible for the whole thing , you know , this tangent I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rothmore admit your guilt , at least . You touched it all off by dragging me to that seder . " He drank off the contents of the glass . Marjorie had never seen him drink this way . It appalled her to watch raw spirits disappear into him like water . He did not cough or even blink . His speech was quite precise , if anything , slightly more so than when he was sober , and he was holding himself very erect . He was silent , moving the white king idly from square to square in the tablecloth , and pursuing it with the black horse . Then he said with sudden gloom , " I do n't know , this involves considerable baring of the soul , which offends the only modesty I have . But , what the hell ! We 'll all be dead in a few years . I do n't know why I take myself so seriously . " " Noel , what 's it all about ? " He had worked Marjorie into a fever of inquisitiveness . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening at your home  --  you know , the seder  --  with the perfectly sober idea that I might become a rabbi . " He grinned at her amazed look . " It 's true . That is , I did n't have the idea when I left your house . I walked the streets all night , going from one bar to another , drinking and walking on . I walked down to the Village from your house . It 's about five miles , you know . Working from saloon to saloon , it took me until dawn . Kid , it was a nerve crisis the like of which I 've neverp274known . Something exploded in my subconscious . It 'll be a long time before I hoot down the idea of ancestral memory again , and all that --  You 're looking at me like a fish . Does all this strike you as insane ? " " I guess I look like a fish when I 'm enthralled , " Marjorie said . " For God 's sake , go on . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half my mind was holding back , you might say , watching the development of this fantasy in my own brain with cool amusement , but little by little it took over my whole spirit , and by dawn I was panting over the idea as I have n't panted about anything  --  includinga girl  --  since I was eighteen . " It all started , Margie , with that charming Sapersteen woman , and her precious little Neville the Devil . What she said about your Passover , when she blew up , was pretty much what I 'd been thinking  --  folk legends , primitive totemism , and so forth . It occurred to me that anything that woman said must be wrong . She sounded exactly like one of these characters I play chess with here , a dreary ass with a headful of Modern Library Giants . That 's when I started to pay attention to the seder . I started to read your prayer book and listen to the melodies . My mind began to catch fire . You know what offended me most about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to feel what he said he was feeling  --  the power of the whole Exodus yarn , the terrific charm of an observance practiced by Jews who crumbled to powder a thousand years before Shakespeare was born , and observed in exactly the same way by your father in 1936 on West End Avenue . It 's electrifying , when you think about it --  " " Maybe your father really felt it , too , Noel . Why not ? " She was very excited . " Darling , take my word for it , the man 's a phonograph . Now , please understand me , Marjorie , I do n't believe your Exodus story or anything else about your religion . But what I suddenly realized that night was , what does that matter ? Suppose it is n't literally true ? Suppose it 's emotionally true , poeticallytrue ? Does that count for nothing ? Is Macbeth true ? It 's a childish ghost story , but nothing truer has ever been written . Well , all this is old stuff , it 's straight Santayana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly alive . And I thought to myself , why must this thing dry up and die ? How much literal truth is there in this lousy world ? How much truth of any kind is there ? This religion is full of fire and comfort , it 's beautiful , it 's a way of life far wiser and better than random scrambling for dough ... . " And then  --  I remember distinctly I was in a bar on Broadway in the Forties , and the man beside me , with a scraggy pink face , was ogling a fat whore in blue satin two stools down  --  it hit me : I 'd go to some theological seminary , study day and night , master Hebrew , give myself two years of the most fanatic work , or at most three --  " Margie , I 've wandered into temples , you know , just for the hell of it , to hear young rabbis preach . I really think they must all be subnormal . It 's inevitable , when you think about it . What man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit in a commercial society ? You get the bunnies , the misfits , the mama 's darlings , and so forth --  " And I thought , why , glory be , I 'd have the field to myself . I 'd be a national sensation . I 'd start a whole trend of talented intellectuals back into , this field . It would spread to the Christian denominations  --  I 'm sure they have the same problems  --  oh , I tell you , by the time dawn came I was the biggest thing since Moses , and better , because I was going to cross that old Jordan myself , and be first man into the Promised Land . I was also somewhat fried . But not feeling it , believe me . " Noel put aside the two chess pieces , which he had been jumping incessantlyfrom square to square . He bolted several more oysters . Marjorie said , " Is this what you 've been working on for the last four days ? I think Sam Rothmore 's likely to forgive you --  " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bed and started to read . You 'd think I 'd have fallen asleep . Not at all . I was so stimulated , my nerves were strung so tight , that I read the Old Testament straight through in about eighteen hours , not skipping anything . It 's not so long , you know . I 'll bet The Brothers Karamazov is longer . I did n't eat . All I did was drink coffee . But as soon as I finished the last page , I did fall asleep . I do n't know to this hour how long I slept . It was blazing day when I woke up . I staggeredout and went to Fourth Avenue , and hunted up a history of the Jews , and a book on the customs and ceremonies . Then I took those home and read them straight through . That only took a few hours . Now maybe I should have stopped at some point and called Sam Rothmore , and explained that I 'd suddenly gotten religion and he 'd have to excuse me for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rothmore might have been on Mars for all I knew or cared . " So there I was , still reading , it must have been late afternoon , four or five . I had n't talked to anybody or eaten for two days . My head was swirling with Moses and Isaiah , with phylacteries and Talmud sages , with the Spanish Inquisition and the separation of milk and meat dishes , the whole picturesquemass tumbling in my brain  --  when the bell rang , and in walked Imogenewith a suitcase . " Noel chuckled at Marjorie 's groan . " She was dog-tired , famished , thirsty , covered with grime . She 'd just come on a bus from Tulsa , Oklahoma , to New York  --  walked out on her husband after a bloody fight , and hocked nearly all her clothes for the bus fare . This so-called oil man she married turned out to be just a shady hick promoter . But she was really in love with the guy , so she stuck it out for three years , and then quit . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scotch and sodas . Which rather surprised me , as I never figured Imogene to have any more feelings than a buffalo . Why she picked my place to come to , I 'm not sure . Probably becauseout of all that dizzy crowd we ran with I 'm the only one whose name 's still in the phone book . " Well , so I told her to take a shower and change her underwear and so forth , and I took her out and bought her a steak , and she perked up amazingly . We got to talking of old times , and the crazy things we 'd done in that crowd , and we laughed and got pretty drunk and all that , and then her fatigue caught up with her , and she went to sleep in my bed . And I was out walking the streets again , trying to pick up the threads where I 'd left off.  | " Margie , this may strike you as the strangest part yet . It had all vanished  --  faded like a dream . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorry , cigarette ? " He was lighting one . She took it , hardly aware of what she was doing , her gaze fixed on his drawn stubbly face and gleaming eyes . " What did you have left ? " " Revulsion , " Noel said , " fearful depressed revulsion , luckily relieved with amusement at myself , the most colossal jackass in the whole Village full of jackasses . I was back in the twentieth century . I was Noel Airman , and there were autos and neon signs all along the street , and a plane going by overhead in the night sky , with its red and green lights blinking . And the notion that I might become a rabbi was about as silly as the thought of my climbing Mount Everest some summer afternoon in sneakers . My mind had exploded in a crazy fantasy , that 's all . The whole incident would make me fear for my mental health , if I did n't have a good idea of what caused it . Imogene pulled me back from the brink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marjorie shook her head slowly , sadly . " I sometimes wonder if you are quite sane . What living man ever tried to absorb a religion in a couple of days , starting from total ignorance ? It was lunacy . The marvel is that you actually went through all that reading . No wonder you had such a violent reaction , it was absolutely inevitable  --  but it proves nothing . Heaven knows I do n't want you to become a rabbi , that part was wild , but some of the things you 've just said make sense , Noel --  " He laid his hand on her arm and patted it . " Marjorie , my dear , please give it up , you 're wasting breath . This fantasy was the last gasp of my resolve to try to become respectable , which really went glimmering after I 'd been at your seder an hour . I saw what you were , and what I was . I shut the realizationout of my mind with this whole burst of sickly enthusiasm because I 'm in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love means marriage . Back of this whole dream was the delicious figure of the young would-be actress Marjorie Morningstar , a reformed , sedate , utterly charming spouse with downcast eyes . Oh , you were in it , all right , but incidental , casual , in true daydream fashion , the real motive masked . " Something in his tone when speaking of her frightened Marjorie . She said hurriedly , " Well , but you say you 're working on something --  " " Yes . " He drummed on the table with the fingers of both hands . " I 'm suddenly ravenously hungry . I 've got to have a steak or I 'll kill myself . You , too ? " " Noel , I just had lunch . " " I keep forgetting . " He rapped loudly with a chess piece , and when the woman came he said , " How about a steak , rare , just off purple , and some home fries ? And rolls , huh ? " The woman beamed . " Good . You need some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than oysters . " She hurried out . " I feel like having a cigar , too , right this second , " Noel said . " I 'm full of queer yens . Can it be that I 'm pregnant ? Intellectually , maybe . Stop me if I start eating chalk . I 'll be right back . " She could see him buying a cigar from the bartender . He came back smoking it . " You know , I do n't smoke half ap277dozen cigars a year . But this one tastes ambrosial . " He dropped down beside her and puffed . " Margie , out of all this turmoil , this queer and rather shattering crisis I 've been through , I think I 've gotten a tremendous idea . One advantage of such a shaking-up is that you see things new and clear again for a while  --  the way everything tastes good and looks good , you know , when you 're recovering from a grippe . You see , I had to ask myself this question : granted that religionis a pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ? What do you want ? What 's good ? " Well , it 's a hell of a thing , I tell you , when all the old philosophic puzzlerscome at you suddenly , with the same urgency as  --  for instance  --  What restaurant shall I eat at tonight ? How can I get this girl into bed ? Where can I get hold of some more money ? '  --  the questions people really spend their time trying to answer . I believe I 've hit on a fresh answer , a serious and original idea , that is going to make a bit of a noise . " I 'm still struggling to reduce it to words . Whether I 'll ever be able to get it right , I do n't know . It could be a book  --  rather short , but rather difficult  --  or a long Socratic dialogue , or a series of connected essays . I 'm just writing it out raw , now . Maybe it 'll never be anything but this white-hot fragment as it stands , a pensee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain the form is going to hit me all at once , like a revelation , the way the idea itself did . " I 'm a philosophy major from way back , you know , and even when I was having this religious seizure , as you might call it , I could ticket it in my mind . Santayana slightly tinctured with James , taking on a sudden feverish personal color . And my revulsion was n't against your religion , but all religions . They 're all more or less alike . You ca n't blame the human race for preferring some bright storyteller 's dream or other to the black cold meaningless dark of the real universe . And if one has to make a choice among the durable fantasies , I do n't know that your religion is worse than any . But I have an incurable temperamental preference for facts , however cold and nasty . That disposes of Reverend Airman , twentieth-century evangelist extraordinary . " But I honestly ca n't ticket this new idea of mine . And believe me , Margie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophers , soaked them up . You see , they all suffer from one fatal defect . They 're philosophers . That , they ca n't help . That 's the cage they ca n't get out of . They love words . Thinking is pleasant to them . They ca n't help conceiving the highest good in terms of intelligence and morality . They ca n't avoid it , that 's their nature , they think in those terms the way a cat meows . Whereas the plain people in God 's green world have little morality and less intelligence . People let the butterfly fanciers catch all the butterflies they want , and they let philosophers make up all the philosophies they want . It is n't as though the philosophers were thereby making sizable sums of money and sleeping with the prettiest women , which would be a serious matter . Philosophy seems to the world a highly involved form of sour grapes , by which very clever men prove to themselves that it really is n't worth while to make lots of money and get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting and praising philosophers , Margie . Its attitude can best be summed up as follows : Phi/losophy is the real stuff all right . Everybody in the world ought to be a philosopher , except me . ' " Okay . Religion 's an old worn-out comedy . Philosophy 's the sour grapes of ineffectual geniuses . What 's left ? Anything ? A great deal , obviously . The world moves , it 's well organized , people rush around like mad , work hard , laugh  --  there 's no chaos , no mass suicide . There must be something under the activity , some guiding sustaining idea , some driving belief we all have that keeps us going . What is it ? " You 'll say Marxism contains the answer to all my questions . That is , you wo n't , but everybody else who 's ever warmed the bench where your pretty behind is now resting would say that . But it 's no answer at all . Even granting that Karl with the Smith Brothers ' beard really did figure out a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around  --  I do n't grant it , and I can argue for a week against it , very effectively  --  but all right , let 's say Marxism'sabsolutely true . The big question remains , why should anybody bother to be a communist ? Why the dedication ? Why the drudgery ? Why improve society ? Why do anything ? What do we really want ? What keeps us all moving  --  communists , capitalists , songwriters , little Marjorie Morgenstern too , for that matter , from West End Avenue , with a dream of an electric sign on West Forty-fourth Street blazing out Marjorie Morningstar ? " He paused , looking intently into her face . Marjorie said , " Well , I 'll tell you this , if you 've really answered the questionsyou 've raised , you 'll be the most famous man in the world . " " I 've answered them . " " Well , come on . It 's almost like a murder mystery by now , this big idea of yours . " Noel nodded , his eyes wide and gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to find out who 's the Bat , hey ? Well , it is n't Moses or Jesus , or any religious figure  --  and it is n't Marx , and it is n't Freud --  " " There 's nobody left nowadays , is there ? " " There 's the butler , " Noel said . " The inconspicuous little character who really did it . " " What 's his name , for heaven 's sake ? " At that moment Mrs. Kleinschmidt set the steak before Noel on a thick cracked white plate , brown and sizzling , oozing red juice around a heap of potatoes . He seized knife and fork , cut the steak across the middle , and peered into the purple gash . " Very good . Perfect . Thank you . And a bottle of Guinness , please . " He crushed out his cigar . " Margie , I propose to enjoy this steak more than I have any food in my life . Please eat something . " " No , thank you . " He ate a bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully . If I were to get technical about what I 'm writing , I 'd say it reintroduces teleology as a major concept in dialectical analysis , which in itself is mighty startling , orp279would be in a professional journal , or I 'm very much mistaken . But I 'll spare you the academic verbiage . I think I can put it clearly and simply , and still be fair to it . I 'm developing the concept , briefly , that the force that moves the world is a desire for Hits . Hits . " " Hits ? " Marjorie said , vaguely disappointed . " Now wait , do n't get that dumb stunned look . All important ideas sound trivial or wild the first time you hear them . Let me spell it out a bit . The central truth about human nature and conduct , I say , is hidden inside a fortress of four rings , four walls of illusion , Margie  --  remember that , and rememberNoel Airman said it . Those four walls of illusion are : religion , philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch through those two mushy outer walls , and come upon the big thick bastions of pretty girls and dough . Whereupon it cries , with French gestures , Voila ! Zut alors ! Parbleu ! Here 's the truth ! The real inside story ! We 've found it ! ' It stops there . It never learns that the truth is further inside yet , and that you 've still got to blast . " No , ten million dollars in the bank , and all the pretty girls in bed with you , that 's the final wisdom of the world . People talk religion , but they pursue sex and cash  --  that 's the big secret of life . It 's the entire point of French literature , for instance , the glory of which is supposed to be that it 's wise and matter-of-fact and ironically honest , and lays bare the secrets of the human heart . Well , honey , no man is more saturated with this ironic view than I am . I 've lived with it for a dozen years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk lives a creed . I 've found out the hard way that that 's all it is  --  another creed , another hopeful story , another dreamy lie . " The pretty girls break down first , once you try to grasp the dream . They 're hard to get at , sure , but not nearly as hard as lots of money . Oh , I suppose if I 'd been a little humpbacked spider I 'd have tried to become a millionaire , and then gone out to buy women . But as it was , I simply worked myself into the circle of the pretty girls , the wolf in the fold . They really do herd like sheep , you know , in New York . They do the same things , go to the same parties , talk the same talk , all of them . I actually lived the dream life of the college boys and the bald businessmen . I had models , show girls , all I wanted , the real stuff , ' as they would say , for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not annoying you , I hope ? " Marjorie with an effort took the frown off her face , and unclenched her fists on the table . " Well , you need n't elaborate the point , that 's all . " With the shadow of a crooked grin he said , " But what I 'm getting at should comfort you , if you 're irritated . The pretty girls turn out to be as phony an answer as philosophy . " Pretty girls are just girls , Margie , you see . That 's what finally emerges . The most immoral slut among them , even a dumb roundheels like Imogene , at heart just wants a fellow and a nest and clothes and furniture . What 's more , they tend to be stupider than other girls , because being pretty makes life too easy for them . The day they sprout those charming breasts , they usually turn off their brains , and just bob along on the tide of attention and fun that starts up . Then after a while they 're twenty-five and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts are beginning to droop and the fuss is dying down . Of course by then it 's too late , like as not . They 're empty-headed fools , they ca n't read , they ca n't talk , they ca n't think , their emotions have been gutted by random sleeping around , and their lives are a shambles --  " Marjorie said , " You 're a cruel hound , do you know ? A cruel hound . " " Well , I do n't want to offend you , Margie , truly I do n't , but we 're coming to the heart of the matter . The poor slobs in restaurants and theatres who used to goggle at me when I 'd walk in with one of those girls were suffering for nothing , if they 'd only known . They were thinking , Wowie ! There goes the lucky guy , the guy with the answer . ' But there 's nothing special about a pretty girl , and that 's God 's truth . Once you 're in bed with a girl it hardly matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too close to her , do n't you see ? She 's just a pink warm expanse and a blurry face . The rest is all imagination . No matter who a man 's bedmate is  --  his old boring wife , or the glamorousnew model he 's inveigled or bought  --  when he gets right down to it sex is just the same old clumsy business , Marjorie , that the birds and the bees and the dogs do . If he 's in love , or thinks he 's in love , then it 's charming . If he 's not in love , if he 's just doing it to be doing it  --  Margie , I swear to you , with the prettiest living girl it 's nothing . A man makes it something only by telling himself over and over , Look at me , look at me , I 've got myself a model , a show girl , ' whipping up his imagination to remind himself that he 's achieved the world 's desire . Because it 's so ordinary in fact , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affection for his sagging old wife , or the homely girl next door he grew up with , he 's better off in bed with her than with all the M-G-M starlets , one after another . That is the fact of the matter . Few people have a chance to find it out . And those who do , like me , usually shut up about it . Because they do n't want to knock down their own achievements in their minds , they ca n't afford to . Happily , my self-esteem does n't happen to rest on my box score with girls . " Now you 'll say that certain men spend their lifetime wallowing with one pretty girl after another  --  rich lechers , gangsters , Hollywood wolves . How come , ' you 'll say , these men never find out they 're living a lie , chasing an empty delusion , if it 's so obvious ? ' " And now we 're getting really warm . For them , it 's no lie , no delusion at all . For them , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show girl is n't a show girl . Sex is the least of their preoccupations , though they do nothing but talk and think about it . For a certain low-grade or immature or sick mind , a pretty girl is a Hit . " " Noel , I hate to interrupt you , but your steak 's getting cold . Take a few bites . " She was scared by the flash of anger across his face . He struck the table with his fist . " I 'll eat when I 'm bloody good and ready . What 's the matter , is this too hard for you ? I do n't think I 've used a single three-syllable word . Hell , I 'd be better off telling all this to a turtle . " He splashed Guinness into the empty glass and drank thirstily . Marjorie now decided that there was something seriously wrong with Noel .  |p281She  had frightening forebodings that he might be on the verge of a mental collapse . He looked sick . He fell on the steak and began devouring it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm fascinated , but you said you were starving , and you look starved , that 's all --  " He ate in silence for a while , washing down the meat with Guinness . " Okay , do n't apologize . I should n't have flared . I 'm tense and tired , just do n't interrupt me again . And do n't go blank on me . This takes some telling and some listening . " All this evolved , obviously , from a process of self-searching . I was asking myself , All right , let 's get down to it , just once in this life . What do you honestly and truly want ? Do you want to marry Marjorie Morgenstern , for instance ? You 're in love with her --  " ( Marjorie 's breath caught , and she listened to what followed with a throbbing ache in her breast . ) " She may not be the most beautiful girl in the world , but she is in your silly eyes , and that 's all that counts . . . . ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to marry Marjorie Morgenstern  --  certainly not with my whole heart . Okay , next question , do you want to sleep with her ? Answer , yes and no  --  the chains and the mess would be the same as if I married her . Maybe more so . " " Well , thanks for that , anyway . " Marjorie 's gay tone broke to hoarseness in the middle of the sentence . Noel went on , " Is there some other woman you really want , then ? Miss America ? Hedy Lamarr , maybe ? No , we 've been through all that . Professionalbeauties are dull people , and actresses are hard-boiled guys inside lovely bodies . Well , then , down comes bastion three , sex .  --  You understand , we 've already levelled religion and philosophy . " " I understand , dear . " " Good . We proceed to the last bastion . Money . Cash . L'argent , the great French secret of secrets , which God knows the French actually do revere like religious fanatics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creed . Now , I asked myself , is that the ultimate answer , really ? Is Balzac the last word ? And after a few minutes I burst out laughing to realize how completely I myself refuted that idea . Margie , you know that the path to money , all the money I can ever use , is open to me in Sam Rothmore 's office . Sam , sad old bastard , wants a son . I can have the job by simply showing up on time and answering the mail . In time I can be a millionaire like him , own paintings and black Cadillacs . But I hate the whole prospect so , I 've been fighting it by being a sloven and a washout . I did n't start working in his office because I wanted money , but because I thought maybe you wanted it . And not even because you want it so much . But because your mother estimates men by their earning power , and I was just piqued enough by this whole thing to want to show her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shekels , as well as in all the more important ways --  " " I thought we were going to forget Dr. Shapiro --  " " And the real motive under it all probably was that I suspected , as I still suspect , that you have the same ideas as your mother deep down . And thatp282they 'll emerge like rocks at low tide , when the dream of being Marjorie Morningstar ebbs . " " You 're drawing a lovely picture of me , I must say . " " Please do n't be idiotic enough to take this personally , Margie , will you ? I 'm following the thread of an idea . " " Oh , I see . Following the thread of an idea . " " Yes . Shut up , please . I thought of all the cliches . It 's not money , but what you can buy with it . Money is power . Money is security . Money is freedom . ' And so forth . Well , then , whatever the last bastion is , evidently it 's not money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or security , or whatever money really represents . We have n't come to the prime mover , the uncaused cause , of human nature . As for the French and all their ironic wisdom about sex and cash  --  well , they 're not only erotic lunatics , as Tolstoy said long ago , they 're pecuniary lunatics , that 's the long and short of it , and so to hell with Balzac . I do n't particularly want money  --  or , rather yes , sure , I want it , the way I want a dinner tonight , so that I can go on being Noel Airman , comfortably and pleasantly . But what does Noel Airman really want ? In common with everybody else ? That is the question . " When the answer suddenly broke over me , Margie , I got up and danced . I swear I danced around on the steps of the Forty-second Street Library , where I 'd gotten to with all my walking , hours and hours . I 'd been sitting there on a stone bench by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could barely see the street lamps , just little yellow blurs , it was so foggy  --  it must have been four in the morning . Well , I got up , and danced and capered betweenthose two lions , Marjorie , like the devil on Bald Mountain . " You see , by great good luck I 'd had the crucial clue that same afternoon . " Imogene brought me down to earth , you know , out of that religious seizureI was having , and I remembered that my publishers had had Old Moon Face for a couple of weeks , and I had n't heard anything . I phoned them . They said they 'd been trying to get in touch with me for days . Well , baby , the song 's a dead-sure hit . Crosby is going to record it . Benny Goodman , too . It 'll be played everywhere . My publisher says it 's bigger than Raining Kisses  --  " " Noel ! How marvelous ! " He squeezed briefly the hand she put on his . " I ca n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money , I swear . I know that by being a good boy I can make more in the Paramount hierarchy than I ever will writing songs and shows . But  --  and this is where the French are so cockeyed  --  five thousand earned by a hit song makes me feel richer than fifty thousand earned at a Paramount desk . At the thought of having a hit again after four years , I tell you I 'm filled with a happiness that 's sweet and pure and total . That 's the inspiration that came to me , Marjorie . What makes Noel Airman purely and wholly happy ? Answer : a Hit . Nothing else . A Hit is beauty bare . And if you ask me what I really want out of life after this , I have to tell you I want nothing , really , but another Hit . And after that , another Hit . And for the rest of my life , Hits . I 'm being honest . This is the filthy bottom truthp283that people will never say about themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the fire that will never burn out , Margie , it 's the worm that never dies . " Do n't you see that that 's all money means to the old mumbling billionaires ? Why do they keep working and scheming ? Why do they lie awake nights figuring out new mergers ? They ca n't measure their own security and power , it 's so colossal . They could roll in golden excess for fifty years  --  champagnebaths , diamond dog collars , harems of blondes , they could paper their walls with Rembrandts  --  it would n't begin to dent their pile . Yet they go on making more , and more , and more . Why ? Because every time the total of their net worth jumps up , it 's a Hit . And THAT is the prime mover , the uncaused cause , the center of human nature and conduct , Margie . " I tell you , with this piece once in your hand , the whole puzzle of life falls apart . It 's like calculus , or the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrets of the universe . Not the physical , the social universe . Freud 's sex drive is foolishness compared to it . This thing only grows stronger and stronger and stronger with the years . It 's strongest in old age . Look at a politician , eighty years old , making a speech to a crowd in the rain . What 's driving him ? Not ambition . He 's been a senator for forty years . He can never be anything more . But by winning this election he can have one more Hit . He 'd rather die of pneumonia than risk missing the Hit . Take a minister with a white head , preaching humility and selflessness and meekness  --  why is he rolling his voice so beautifully ? Why is the sermon typed up in extra-large type , so he wo n't have to squint , while he preaches forgetfulness of self ? He wants his sermon to be a Hit . Do n't you suppose the selfless mother , scrimpingand starving to send her pretty daughter through college , regards this girl as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose a communist is making himself part of the great Hit of history ? Take a dried-up old skeptic like Santayana . If life 's really meaningless and valueless , just a pretty dream , why bother to write about it ? Why say life is meaningless in twenty volumes full of exquisite meaning ? Obviously because every volume means another Hit for old Santayana  --  no other reason is possible . Turn wherever you will on the human scene , this thing governs . It 's as universal as gravitation , it 's as allpervadingas Spinoza 's God . . . . " He fell silent , staring wildly at her , and she felt terribly nervous . " Well ? I could go on and on , but why should I ? That 's it . Rough , hurried , told all wrong . Does it mean anything to you ? Does it convey one thousandth of the light to you that it does to me ? " " Noel , it 's absolutely brilliant --  " His face shone . " It really does get over to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh yes , yes indeed . " " Thank God . " He looked at the knife and fork clutched forgotten in his hands , grease hardening on them in little bubbles . He cut into the steak , then threw down the knife and fork and pushed the plate away . " What on earth is this great bloody hunk of a dead cow doing under my nose ? It 's the most repulsive thing I 've ever seen . " He pounded on the table with his fist and yelled , " Mrs. Kleinschmidt ! Take this away ! Bring me a drink . "  |p284Marjorie  said , " Noel , eat something , please do , you need it . " " Marge , if I eat another bite of that purple horror , I 'll go mad . I 'd as soon eat a boiled child . How can people eat meat , anyway ? I swear , I 'm going to turn vegetarian . " The woman started to mutter when she saw the uneaten steak , but after one glance at Noel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a double drink of rye . He drank half of it . " Tell me more about how good my idea is , Marge . You ca n't imagine how I need to hear it . I feel like Galileo the first time he saw Jupiter 's moons . The man must have run around like a scared rat , to find someone else to look through his telescope and tell him he was n't crazy . " " Noel , what you 're saying is n't crazy in the least . It 's absolutely true . You 're proving that what really drives people is nothing but egotism . Everybodyknows that 's so , actually . And the way you put it , it 's even --  " Some of the gladness went out of Noel 's expression . " Egotism ? Who said anything about egotism ? I never mentioned the word egotism , not once . " " Well no , but this hunger for hits , what is it but just plain egotism ? You 're completely right , Noel . The more I study people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was covering his face with his hands , groaning . " Now what 's wrong , for heaven 's sake , darling ? " He took his hands away and looked at her for a long time , his face dead gray . " Margie  --  Margie , my dear good girl  --  to say that people are driven by egotism is probably the dullest and most obvious banality that the human mind can ever achieve . Do n't tell me that what I 've been working on for four hysterical days and telling you for twenty solid minutes amounts to no more than that . Do n't . . " Noel , I do n't think it 's a banal idea at all . It 's a very shrewd observation . " , His staring sunken black-shadowed eyes were making her more and more uneasy . He said , " I daresay I skimmed over it , left out all the fine points , ruined it in the telling , but still  --  Margie , you should have gotten more out of it than that . This idea has absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear . Why , the difference between the passion for Hits and egotism  --  egotism is solipsist , do n't you see , Hits are externalized , that 's the whole point  --  maybe I should have made that a hell of a lot clearer  --  I 'm sure I have in my writing  --  " His voice was fading . He seemed to be talking to himself . " But you 're right , by God , the thing actually does skirt the most ghastly and empty banality , does n't it ? If I do n't make that one difference crystal-clear the whole thing is nothing but the vapidest college-boy philosophizing and  --  how fundamental is that difference ? Is n't it just a question of projection , is n't the externalizing just a secondary mechanism ?  --  No , no . " He glared and hit the table with both fists . " It 's my punishment for being so damn eager , that 's all , for talking technical philosophy to a girl . Margie , it 's not your fault . I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air out with your hatpin , but I do n't think so . I 'll still get this thing down on paper and show it to somebody who knows  --  "  | " Noel , I did n't mean to discourage you . On the contrary , I really think you 've hit on something extraordinary , I really do , dear --  " He smiled at her and drank off the rye . He coughed a little and slumped back on the bench . " Whew . " " I think you should go home and get some sleep , a whole lot of sleep , Noel , before you do any more work . It 'll come out better , you know it will , in the end . You 're just burning up your last resources of nervous energy , and living on alcohol , and that 's no way to write anything really good . " " I have been in quite a state , " he said , and his voice was low , weary , and relaxed . " That must be fairly obvious . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd wanted to --  Marjorie , have you ever thought of a joke in your dreams that seemed the funniest and smartest joke in the world ? And then awakened and realized that it was absolutely silly , made no sense at all ? " " Lots of times , but --  " " It 's barely possible that this whole idea , this rigmarole about Hits , is just another manic fantasy , after all , a mishmash of Adler , Nietzsche , La Rochefoucauld , and who knows what else  --  just another lulling hallucination to keep my nerves from going PAING ! like a thousand breaking piano wires --  " " It is n't , Noel , do n't believe that --  " " I wo n't , do n't worry , not yet . But if it turns out that way  --  well , hell , I would n't be surprised if the earth goes on turning . On the whole , I 'm glad I got to tell it to you , before I left . The feminine reaction always has its coldwatervalidity , tempering if nothing else --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat up and took her hand , looking at her with a sad smile . She said after a terrible moment or two , " Noel , what is it ? Where are you going ? " " Marjorie Morgenstern , love of my life , we 're through . Is n't that obvious to you ? We 're not going to see each other after today . We would n't have seen each other today if you had n't come barging down to my apartment , and if Imogene had n't thought you were a grocery boy . I 'm going to Mexico , probably Sunday morning , driving down with a sculptor friend of mine , Phil Yates . Just as soon as I finish a draft of what I 'm writing , and get an advance from my publisher to buy us a jalopy . Bye-bye Rothmore , bye-bye Marjorie , bye-bye the whole bourgeois dream . It was great fun , as the fellow says , but it was just one of those things . " His glance was kind , melancholy . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely , not much surprise . " No . In fact , it 's quite all right , Noel . It 's probably for the best . " " You do think so ? " " I suppose so . I hope so . It 's a little sudden , but that 's all right , too . " " Kill or cure , Marjorie . Clean break . It 's the only way . " " I 'm sure you know all about how to do these things . " " You 're going to be bitter ? " " No . Really not . " " Do n't . Some of it 's been harrowing , I know , but we 've had a marvelous  |p286time  , on the whole , and we have n't maimed each other for life  --  and we 're at an absolute impasse , really , there 's nothing else to do -- - " " Noel , it 's all right . I 'll live . It 's far from unexpected . " She was astonished to find herself putting a handkerchief to her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making this break myself often , believe me . I sort of wish I 'd done it first , that 's all . No girl likes to be kicked out . You can understand that . " " Marjorie , you 're kicking me out . You know you are . " " Am I ? I guess I 've got this conversation turned around in my mind . " " I 've never been through a battle like this in my life . You 've beaten me . " He looked haggard , almost forty , she thought , slumped with his hands jammed in the pockets of his shabby overcoat , his long hair disorderly , thick blond bristles all along his jaw . " You never gave an inch . It had to be on your terms or none at all . Well , no , that is n't quite so . At South Wind you started out like any other girl . But ever since your uncle died , it 's been this way . No girl ever thrust terms on me before . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But it 's hopeless , Marjorie . It 's been driving me slowly out of my head . I 'm still a little panicky at the narrowness of my escape . I 've been in a panic ever since that seder at your house . Going through black depressions and golden exaltations like a real nut . It 's got to end , it 's got to . " His voice trembled . " That seder . My mother 's bright idea --  " " Brighter than you think , maybe . Ask your mother what her real motive was , some day . Some day when this is all long in the past , Margie , and she 's dandling her third grandson on her knee , on your lawn in New Rochelle  --  little Ronald Shapiro  --  you ask her --  " " All right , shut up ! " Marjorie said . " One blessing at least is that I 'll hear no more now of that damned Dr. Shapiro . " Noel said , " You 're right . I keep harping like a stupid boor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just remember this , Noel , I never told you to go to work for Sam Rothmore . You did it all by yourself . All I said was that while you worked for him it was only fair that you do a decent job . I think going to work at Paramount may have been a terrible mistake . That 's what 's been depressing you . You should have stuck to your composing , and not lost faith in yourself . I never lost faith in you . I still have n't . I told you that song was going to be a big hit . And I 'll tell you something else . Princess Jones is going to materialize , and it 's going to be glorious . You 're going to be tremendously successful on Broadway , probably in a year or two , if only you work at it . You 're on the verge . " His face was coming to life again . He sat up and his eyes brightened . She began to put on her coat . " Only you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on any more wild-goose chases like being a rabbi , or inventing new philosophies about Hits , or whatever . I wish you the best of luck , I swear to God I do . I 'll never regret knowing you . It 's been an education . I 've got to get home . Goodbye . " " Wait . " He stopped her as she moved to get up . " Really , I 've got to go , Noel . Mom 's in bed with a cold  --  "  | " You sit . " She did not fight hard against the push . " What is it ? I can only stay another minute . It 's all over --  " " There 's a few more things we 'd better get straight . So long as we 're being frank with each other , and you 're regarding this as part of your education . Which is an astonishingly sensible way to look at it . But you 're a sensible girl , unusually sensible . Your advice to me is very acute . Thanks for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you , I 'd forget Marjorie Morningstar . I 've been rough and mean with you about that , purposely . The fact is , you do have some talent . You really do . You make a sweet exciting figure on the stage . Your voice is weak and thin , but that can be corrected . For someone without any training , you have a surprising flair for projecting a character . Only --  " Her eyes were moistening . " Dog , you might have said this long ago --  " " Marjorie , my sweet , you 're not an actress . You 're not built to take the strain and smut and general rattiness of a stage life . You 're a good little Jewish beauty , with a gift for amateur theatricals . Take my advice , direct all the temple plays in New Rochelle , and be the star in them , and let it go at that --  " " You supercilious son of a bitch , I 'm not going to live in New ' Rochelle . " He could not have looked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " Dear me , Marjorie ! Such language . " " Any other advice for me , Father Time ? " " You 're angry . " " Oh , not in the least . I 'm just swimming in pleasure at being jilted and patronized and called a stupid bourgeois Jewess seven different ways all in a few breaths  --  " She stopped because he caught her wrists in a bony cold very painful grasp . He said gruffly , " I love you . Do n't you understand , you little torturer ? You 've executed the vengeance of your non-existent God on me . I 've never loved or wanted any girl in my life as I do you . But I 'm not going to commit suicide to have you , nor put myself in a booby hatch , nor turn myself into a nice tame stepson of Sam Rothmore . You 're an absolute infant . You do n't know what you 've done to me . You 've damn near destroyed me . I ache with pleasureright now , just touching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're ten years away from understanding passion , and nothing can hurry you into fathoming it , absolutely nothing . It 'll all come in time . Your passion will force itself up out of the stony soil of your Jewish prejudices , like a tree , and some unknown dolt of a steady-earning doctor or lawyer will pluck the fruit . And I 'll be old or dead , or for all I know rich and famous , as you say , but I 'll never never have Marjorie Morgenstern , and she 's all I want . " She was crying , and she could see Mrs. Kleinschmidt watching them from the barroom , but she did n't care . " Why did you ever come back to me ? It was all over after South Wind . Why are you whining ? You know you started it all up again . You did it . " " Sure I did . And I made the one frightful blunder that 's all but driven me insane . I resolved to play the game by your asinine rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Not to touch a girl . That 's been at the root of this whole series of aberrations . I 've been in a state of unnatural tension for months . It 's served to halo you with a ridiculous glamor , and it 's made all kinds of idiotic behavior seem normal and even spectacularly clever , like goingto work for Rothmore . It 's been nothing but collegiate sex hunger , turninga grown man inside out . I doubt I 'd have had the courage to this moment to call it quits with you if Imogene had n't come along and broken that spell . Now at least I can think and analyze without a rosy haze of sex yearning to discolor all the values --  What 's the matter ? ' What are you staring at ? " He pushed her down as she started to rise stiffly , like a machine . " Good Lord , do n't tell me you believed Imogene ! Do n't tell me you really thought for five seconds that I 've been sleeping upstairs ! " " I did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were being really subtle , pretending to ignore it , letting me sweat . Marjorie , how childish and unrealistic can you be ? Imogene and I have been on a racketing sex binge for days . I 've never been through anything like it . She 's learned things in Oklahoma that His teeth felt hard and sharp against her palm as she slapped him with all her strength . She stood . " I 'm in love with you , you rotten tramp , " she said . " That 's why I believed her . Get your feet out of my way . I 'm going home . " He was looking at her with a lopsided grin as she slipped past him . " Fair enough . Goodbye , my love . " She turned on him . " You 're a disgrace . To your father , to yourself , to the Jews , to anybody who has any part in you . I 'll never stop thanking God for being free of you . Even if you become the most famous man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning on the bench , dishevelled , dingy , looking as desirable as ever . Her hands wanted to touch his hair . She ran out of the saloon . It had begun to snow , in a queer bluish twilight . With snowflakes whirling about her , stinging her hot cheeks and making her eyes blink , she ran two blocks to the subway . She rode uptown for fifteen minutes before realizing , when a colored woman came into the car with snow clinging to her rabbit fur collar , that it was strange to be having snow in April . Noel 's first letter , lying at the door in the morning mail a couple of weeks later , gave her a frightening throb of gladness . She had been dragging through the days , waking to mental misery , walking with it , and lying down with it ; seeing him in crowds and in magazine illustrations , picturing him as the hero in the novels from the lending library ; telling herself she was well out of it , and believing it , and yet no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter into her bedroom , like a cat with a stolen fish head ; closed the door , and stood staring at the envelope , passing her fingers over the thin airmail paper and the gaudy green and yellow Mexi/can stamp . Then she read it . It was a long breezy typewritten account of his automobile trip , with enthusiastic descriptions of Mexican scenery and food . She skipped through the paragraphs , searching for a line about herself and himself . But there was nothing . It was headed " Hi , darling , " and signed " Love , Noel . " She flung the letter on the bed . Later she read it over and over . She tore it up after a few days without having answered it or noted his address in Mexico City ; nevertheless , she knew the address . For weeks thereafter she kept watching the mail . She knew it was irrational to hope for mail from him without answering his letter , but her conduct had little to do with logic . She haunted the producers ' offices and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result as ever . But she had learned by now that discouragement was the bread of Broadway , and she kept at her rounds ; if nothing else , the pain of being ignored by the theatre distracted her from the pain of having been dropped by Noel . During this time Marjorie 's evenings filled with dates , once the " kids " ( as the young unemployed actors and actresses at the drugstore called each other ) found out that she was free . She tried necking once or twice , to get her mind off Noel , but it was disheartening flat foolishness , and she gave it up . She went docilely to temple dances , crowding her date calendar still further with young lawyers , businessmen , and doctors . The contrast between her temple friends and the " kids " made for what slight amusement she could find in the days . Marjorie did n't encourage any of them . She accepted their invitations calmly , and dined or danced with them placidly , and yielded a kiss at her door , after some formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned courtesy . Oddly enough , the one person among all her new dates who woke a stir of interest in her was a man named Dr. Morris Shapiro . She met him at a Zionist lecture to which she was more or less dragged by her parents . When he was introduced to her , she inadvertently burst out laughing on hearing the name . Then to cover her embarrassment at this startling rudeness , she went out of her way to be pleasant to him ; and he soon was taking her out every week or so . He turned out to be not a bad fellow , about thirty-two , with an excellent sense of humor and a sharp mind . After a while she began to enjoy his company , in a fashion , and to overlook his scanty hair , blackringedeyes , and puffy pallor . He was obviously and frankly smitten with her . Eventually she told him why she had laughed at him at their first meeting ; he pleased her by being genuinely amused . He said that he was grateful to Noel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's destiny any time she said the word . " I might believe you were my destiny if your name were Max , " Marjorie answered . " That 's the big discrepancy . " " The importance of being Max , " he said . " Why did n't you tell me ? I 'll go to court and get it changed , if that 's all you want . " She laughed at him . Noel 's second letter came when she had almost given up looking at the mail . There it was at last , the bright Mexican stamp poking through the  |p290usual  trash of bills , charity requests , and circulars . It was another brisk typewrittentravelogue . There was one faint personal touch in the last line : " Be civilized and write a guy a postcard , wo n't you ? Do n't be melodramatic . Nobody loves me . Noel . " She did n't tear up this one . Noel 's song had been published , and it was a great success ; she was hearing it at night clubs and restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up , she would see Noel at the piano in Sam Rothmore 's inner office , with his long blond hair falling on his forehead , the blue eyes blazing . She fought off the temptation to write him for two weeks . Late one night , coming home from an evening of dancing with Morris Shapiro , in a lively mood ( she had landed a summer-stock job that day ) , with the strains of i Old Moon Face running in her head , she sat at her desk and dashed off this note : Dear Noel : Nobody loves you indeed . I pity you . I suppose the two senoritas sitting on your lap as you read this do n't count . Give them my best . Your Mexican trip sounds fascinating , and I wish I could figure out some respectable way to join you , but I ca n't . So you 'll have to be satisfied with your sculptor and the senoritas . And , of course , your memories . By the way , they 're playing Moon Face all over town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day in Sam Rothmore 's office . Congratulations . I guess you 're rolling in royalties . I 've moved up a bit in the world too . All the pavement-pounding has at last paid off , after a fashion . I 'm going to the Rip Van Winkle Theatre for the summer . I guess you know all about the place . Katharine Hepburn graduated from there , so why not Marjorie Morningstar ? All the kids say it 's the best of the summer theatres . I 'm the new heroine of the drugstore . Seems I practically broke into Cliff Rymer 's office , took him by the throat , and made him listen to me read Pygmalion . I really did . Desperation makes one do strange things . I 'm only an apprentice actress , so I wo n't get paid , but at least I 'll get my room and board . I 'll be off my parents ' backs , thank God . Most important , I 'll be acting at last . Yes , I 'm still chasing that dream , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still say you 'll live to apologize to me backstage on my opening night . However , it may amuse you to know that my love life now includes a Dr. Shapiro . There would be something eerie about it , except that his name is n't Max , it 's Morris . I told him about your standard joke , and he offered to change his name to Max , the fool . But do n't worry , your predictionsare n't coming true . Dr. S. is great fun ( we 've just been dancing ) but it 's still Marjorie Morningstar for me , I 'm afraid , unless our medical friend acquires a white horse somewhere and carries me off . Which he may be capable of , at that . Well , you rascal , have yourself a time . Do n't drink too much tequila , or you might wake up married to a tubby little senorita with thick ankles one bright morning . And would n't that be a sad end to the Masked Marvellp291In signing it , she paused a long time . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked too stiff and had a hint of hurt pride in it . So she recopiedthe second sheet of the letter , just to be able to sign it Best . She left the letter on the desk and went to bed . In the morning she hesitatedover mailing it . She knew that the only sensible course was to throw away Noel 's letters , and never write to him . But the digs about Dr. Shapiro seemed pretty neat , even by daylight . She sent the letter . The same day a printed invitation to Wally Wronken 's college graduation exercises came in the mail , together with a note on scratch-pad paper : I 'm not asking you to be my date . Just come . Please . Slightly curious to see poor Wally in his cap and gown , she went to the commencement . To her surprise , he was the salutatorian , and he received a minor prize for French studies . On the platform he looked pallid , terribly earnest , and not nearly as young as before . After the exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolding a small Kodak , and shook his hand . The parents and sister looked amazed . " I was very proud of you , Wally . I 'm sure your family was , too . " Wally said , " Ruth , take a picture of me and Margie . Just one , Marge . All right ? " Before she could say anything he had her by the waist , and was turning her toward the camera . The sister , with a grudging glance , snapped the picture . " There , you 're compromised forever , " Wally said . " Send me a print . I 'll probably show it proudly to my grandchildren , " Marjorie said . The print came in the mail just before she went to Sleepy Hollow . On the back was written , World renowned actress , just before her rise to fame . Exhaustiveresearch fails to reveal identity of strange man in cap and gown with glasses and long nose . She laughed and dropped it in the rosewood box where she kept favored souvenirs . She meant to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . About the middle of June , she received a mimeographed instruction pamphletfrom the Rip Van Winkle Theatre which contained an unpleasant surprise . There was a page and a half of cloudy verbiage on the subject of money , but what it boiled down to was that Marjorie had to pay fifteen dollars a week for room and board . At the end of the summer , if box-office receipts were normal , all this subsistence money would be paid back to her , with a bonus , the size of which would depend on work performed . Katharine Hepburn , the pamphlet pointed out , had earned a bonus of seven hundred dollars , when she was utterly unknown . Marjorie was appalled at having to ask her parents for fifteen dollars a week . But somehow she choked it out at dinner that night . The father and mother looked grave ; then Mr. Morgenstern , with one of his infrequent wistfulsmiles , reached over and patted Marjorie 's hand . " My God , do n't look so guilty . It wo n't kill us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an overgrown parasite --  " " It 'll be all right . " " I 'll earn it all back , I swear I will . I 'll bring back a bonus . "  | " Say , you 'll probably bring back seven hundred dollars , like Katharine Hepburn . " " If she lasts out the summer , " said Mrs. Morgenstern . So Marjorie went off to the Rip Van Winkle Theatre . Six weeks later , on an extremely muggy August afternoon , she appeared bag and baggage at the Morgenstern apartment , looking flushed , tired , and dirty . She vanished into her room with hardly a word of greeting to her mother . At the dinner table she showed up fresh and elegant , but full of mysterious wrath , and coughing violently from time to time . Her answers to questions about her work at the summer theatre and her reasons for coming home were short and uninformative . She kept up this lowering silence for a couple of days , and spent most of the time on her bed in a housecoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mood did n't seem to . It was Wally Wronken to whom she finally unburdened herself . He came in from South Wind to see his parents off to Europe . With an evening to spend alone in town , he forlornly called Marjorie 's parents to ask how she was , and found himself talking to her . She readily accepted his happy stammered invitation to dinner . " I 'm still furious , " she said to him . " I can hardly bring myself to discuss it . " They were at a small expensive steak house in the theatre district . " I know what you probably think and what my parents certainly think  --  that I ran blubbering home because the work was too hard and I was n't getting all the star parts --  " Wally said solemnly , " Marge , I know you better than that . " After a dangerous glance at him she went on , " Well , I do n't much care what anybody thinks . But believe me , I stayed on for weeks after I saw I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have that said about me . I was going to stick the season out no matter what . But then Morris came up last Saturday and when --  " " Morris ? That 's a new name . Who 's Morris ? " " Do n't you know about Morris ? Well , he 's a very nice guy , a doctor  --  but never mind pulling such a long face , Wally , it 's nothing like that . And it 's about time you stopped all that phony languishing , anyway . You 're getting too old for Marchbanks . " " Curious , is n't it ? And you 're getting too young for Candida . " " Thank you . I 'm beginning to need such compliments --  Anyway  --  listen , Wally , I worked like a dog at the Rip Van Winkle . You can ask any of the kids who were there . I was up late , night after night , sewing costumes , carpentering  --  Iturned out to be surprisingly handy with a hammer and saw . You never know what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose at her . " Hammer and saw ? You ? " " Dear , mostly what I did at Rip Van Winkle was build scenery . Oh , and nail up double-decker bunks , and repair the roof when it rained in on us , and such things --  " " Marge , do n't they have men up there ? " " Do n't talk to me about men , Wally . That is , actor-men . They 're an aber/ration of Nature . I swear to you , Wally , compared to the average actor , a peacock is a beast of burden . I think they exhaust themselves with all that running a comb through their hair . You 'd think they 'd gouge tracks in their scalps with those combs . And a girl is supposed to fall down curling with ecstasy if one of them so much as asks her what time it is . You see , there arc four girls for every man at the Rip . Maybe it 's that way at all summer theatres . I do n't know --  Anyway , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave , that 's all , my hands all blisters , no sleep  --  and mind you , I like working on scenery and costumes , I like anything remotely connected with the theatre , but there 's such a thing as enough --  " " There were other girls , were n't there ? How did you get so loaded with work ? " " It was n't me alone . Me and a couple of others . That 's Cliff Rymer 's fiendishly clever system . Oh , I tell you he 's got it down pat . He 'll work the last drop of blood out of a girl , a girl with any real desire to act , that is . He hardly bothers the boys . Obviously he hates girls . He used to stand around and watch us hammering fiats together in the broiling sun , a couple of girls in filthy old jeans and halters , pouring sweat , hair hanging , looking like witches  --  and he 'd just stand there , with a look on his face like a kid pulling wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nose , see ? A star part in one of the September shows . Like for me , Eliza in Pygmalion , my old standby , which they 're doing on Labor Day . Another girl was on the hook the same way for Anna in Anna Christie . Naturally , if you think there 's a chance , you want to please and impress Cliff Rymer . You 're about ready to die to impress him . So , you work , you smile , chin up , you take walk-ons , you kill yourself building sets , you smile sweetly selling tickets or working as an usher  --  and it gets mighty cold at night in an evening dress in that barn in Sleepy Hollow , let me tell you . I caught the most horrible cough . It kept me out of shows , but not out of carpentering , of course . You can hammer and saw between coughs . And Mr. Rymer is pleased and drops another word about Eliza and you 're happy --  " The waiter set steaks before them . Marjorie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rip . Gad , the food ! A herd of pigs would have gone on strike , but the apprentice actresses did n't dare  --  we practically lived on peanutsand Hershey bars . . . Mm ! These rolls ! Are n't they exquisite ? Our breakfast rolls seemed to come out of a quarry  --  cold , hard , jagged . You 'd tear your gums eating them . I 'm not exaggerating , Wally . You 'd bite at a roll and there 'd be blood on it . Oh well . This is a good steak . " " Did you get to play any parts ? " " A few bits , yes --  " She put her napkin over her mouth and had a paroxysmof coughing . " Gad , I thought I was over this .

It was Saturday afternoon , and I was staying in bed trying to shake the thing off so I would n't cough during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris said if I left the bed to be an usher that night he 'd never talk to me again . When he saw me come into the theatre in a bare-back evening dress he just turned purple . So we had this big battle afterward . He calledp294me an imbecile , said I was just being victimized , and so forth . Well , my back was up , you know , so I called him a Philistine . But he was absolutely right . You see , I 'd found out just a couple of days before that I could n't possibly play Eliza . The part had been promised way back in June to a girl named Sally Trent  --  you know , the blonde who did that wonderful drunk scene in the last Kaufman play  --  I did n't have a prayer . I never had had a prayer . Oh , I hated , really really hated , Wally , to leave my dad 's money in Cliff Rymer 's little fat paws . No refunds , of course , if you quit . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it 's scrubbing floors , and pay Dad back . " Wally said , " Rymer has a fine thing there . He 'll never run out of slave labor , will he ? No matter how many he disillusions , there 's always a new crop of girls every year dying to go on the stage . " " There sure is . Noel calls it a tropism of middle-class girls . He seems to be right . I think ninety per cent of the kids at the Rip were exactly that , creaturesobeying a tropism . For all I know , I 'm one too . By the way , I was MarjorieMorningstar at long last  --  " " Congratulations  --  " " Thanks . I have six playbills to prove it . Though I 'm an usher on three of them . " " How is Noel ? " Wally said , carefully pouring the coffee . " Oh , fine . " " In Mexico , is n't he ? " " Yes . " " Heard from him ? " " Sure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have n't the vaguest idea . Until his royalties on Old Moon Face run out , I guess . " After a moment 's pause Wally said , " What 's all this about his going to Hollywood ? " With a pang of astonishment , which she did her best to hide , she said , " Hollywood ? That 's news to me . " " He wrote Creech that he 's got a Hollywood offer . He 's going there when he gits tired of Mexico . " " Well , how nice . " " Strange he did n't write you about it . " " Strange ? How so ? " " Margie , have you and Noel broken up ? " Marjorie sipped coffee . " There was nothing to break up , Wally . Noel Airman'sjust a pleasant ghost . Now you see him , now you do n't . I had a marveloustime with him , and I would n't have missed it for worlds . But he 's melted into thin air now , so far as I 'm concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She broke off in surprise , seeing Wally pull a pack of Lucky Strikes from his pocket . " What happened to the Kools ? " " I do n't know . Guess I 've graduated . " His little furtive hunched gesture of lighting was gone ; he struck a match and puffed . She had noticed too that hep295looked directly at her , instead of at the ceiling or the tablecloth . " Margie , why do n't you come back to South Wind for the rest of the summer ? " " Me ? South Wind ? " " Greech would take you back in a minute . He talks about you a lot . " " I 'll never go back there , Wally . " His large brown eyes , looking straight at her , were clever , almost girlishly soft , behind the glasses . " Why ? " " I never will . " " Well , of course , it would be too good to be true , having you to myself up there . " " Have n't you graduated from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . You just like to make these melancholy sounds . " Wally said , " Maybe you 're a symbol of some kind . I admit it 's gone on too long . I seem to be evolving from Marchbanks to Major Dobbin . The funny part of it is , Margie  --  and this is where the books are so wrong  --  Major Dobbin can turn around and be Heathcliff to some other girl . " " Well , well . How are you doing as Heathcliff ? " " Not complaining . " " Good for you , " Marjorie said . " I 'm also writing a brilliant farce . Creech mistakenly thinks I 'm coming back next year . Next year I 'll be famous , and rich , and independent . In fact , ca n't I beat you into insensibility with my prowess and my prospects , and drag you off by the hair to my cave ? " " You almost sound like Noel . " " Let 's go home . " " Would n't you like to take me dancing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . I 'll take you anywhere you say , till dawn , you know that . " " The thing about you is , Wally , you probably do n't want to get married . You use me as an excuse to the little girls who are beginning to try to trap you . The great lost love , and all that . " He stared for several seconds before smiling awkwardly . " Now you sound like Noel . " " Oh , sure . The Masked Marvel , he used to call himself . He was an education , all right . " She pulled over her shoulders the cerise shawl Noel had sent her from Mexico . " Seems to be haunting the conversation , does n't he ? Old trick of his . Let 's go . " The first thing she said in the taxi was , " Remember telling me last year that Noel was n't going to amount to anything ? How about Old Moon Face ? " " I remember being very drunk on rum and pineapple juice , and I rememberan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , " Wally said . " I do n't remember much else except wanting to choke you , or beat you with a rock . Old Moon Face is a superb song . I 'd be an ass to deny it . When Noel is in stride , he 's terrific . " " He 's rewritten Princess Jones . It 's bound to get produced one of these days , " Marjorie said . " It 'll be a sensation . Then I guess we 'll all be boasting we knew him when . " " Could be , " Wally said , with less good nature.  |p296His  dancing had much improved , too . She said to him during a slow fox trot , leaning back in his arms , " I think you 've got a girl . " " Thousands , if you want to know . " " No . One . Somebody 's been working on you . " " How do you like the result ? " " Just do n't get too smooth . You would n't be yourself any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told her the plot rather reluctantly . It seemed to her a wild and unfunny business . " It reads much funnier than it sounds , " Wally said . " Is there a part in it for me ? " Wally grinned . " If you 'll agree to a fate worse than death I 'll write one in . " " Sorry , I ca n't see you as the seducer of hopeful actresses , Wally . That 's Noel 's side of the street . " Wally glanced sidewise at her , twisting the glass stick of his highball in his hands . " Some day you 'll have to tell me how you fended Noel Airman off . It 's one of the marvelous achievements of the twentieth century , like Lindbergh 's flight to Paris . " " You 're assuming I succeeded in fending him off . " " I think I 'd know if you had n't . " There was another silence . For the first time since she had known him he caused her a stir of enjoyable discomfort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all these clever writers . I think I 'll marry a doctor and get it over with , just as Noel prophesied . No use fighting it . " " Dr. Morris ? " " Morris Shapiro is the name . Maybe , who knows ? He 's really a great guy , once you get to know him . " " He has a discardable sound . " " Just for that , I will marry him . " " Marjorie Shapiro , " Wally said meditatively . " No . I do n't feel the cold clutch at my heart . There 's no fate in it . " " That 's exactly the name Noel predicted for me , strangely enough . MarjorieShapiro . " In a totally different voice , hard and a little shrill , Wally said , " Would it be too great a strain on you , Marjorie , if neither of us said anything more this evening about Noel Airman ? " " Why , it 's you who keeps talking about him , is n't it ? " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the taxi drew up in front of her home at half-past one in the morning , she held her face up to him unthinkingly for a kiss . " Nothing doing , " Wally said . It startled her . She was rather sleepy . She peered at him , dropping her chin . " Huh ? " He took her hand . " You wo n't really marry Dr. Shapiro yet , will you ? I mean , there 's another couple of years yet . " " Oh , you fool . " She put her hand to his face for a moment . " If it gives you pleasure to carry on like that , I 'm sure I do n't mind . I 'll warn you before I marry Dr. Shapiro. "  | " Promise ? " " Okay . I promise . " She laughed . " Small danger , since you insist on wormingit out of me . " With the humiliation of the summer-theatre fiasco  --  of having wasted ninety dollars and six weeks , of having crawled home defeated and bilked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom in her own soul . She told herself that unless she was paid real money for acting  --  the amount did n't matter , a dollar would be enough to start with , symbolically  --  but unless she earned that dollar , and fairly soon , she had better face the fact that she was living a childish fantasy . So she set out on an earnest and grim quest for the dollar . She fanatically studied all the theatrical trade papers , and listened hungrily to every scrap of gossip at the drugstore about new plays . Again she trudged to the producers ' offices to try out for any part that seemed in any way suited to her . Again she could never get past the contemptuous office boys and telephone girls . Her amateurishness seemed written on her forehead , a mark of Cain . The same thing happened when she decided to try for radio jobs . The advertisingagencies , unimpressed by her condescension , turned her away at the outer railings of their offices . So did the networks . She made the round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two communist enterprises and a little company that sent out shows to tour churches and Kiwanis clubs . She answered every advertisementfor actresses that she saw ; she followed up every lead that came to her ears in the drugstore , however unpromising . It became clear after a couple of months that she could get all the theatrical work she wanted  --  of a certain kind . There were radio groups and experimental theatre groups , universitygroups and temple groups , charity groups and educational groups ; an almost infinite number of groups , diverse as they could be in origin , and similar in two characteristics : a willingness to use actresses , and an unwillingness to pay them . At any place where money was to be made by an actress , Marjorie was shut out as though she were black . Only the fact that this had been the experience of all the kids in the drugstoreconsoled her . Some of the girls were beautiful , and in her opinion strikingly talented . Evidently this preliminary discouragement was a part of the game . The kids had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of rejection . The new star of the new hit comedy had hung around these very booths in despair only two years ago , ready to go home to Nebraska for good . With such tales went a litany of cheering phrases . " One of us is going to make it . . . . There 's always room at the top ... . All it takes is one break .... " Marjorie began to pay more attention to the talk at the drugstore about other ways of earning money . Some of the kids supported themselves by working as movie ushers or salesclerks . They tried to get part-time or evening jobs , so as to be free in the afternoon when the drugstore buzzed with life . A few of the prettiest girls and handsomest boys worked as photographers '  |p298models  . There were less savory recourses . A couple of girls , it was whispered , were posing in the nude , or at least with bared chests , for painters and photographers ; and some resorted to posing for lingerie and stocking advertisements , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted working as a taxi dancer . A tall shabby southern boy with a shock of wheat-colored hair was supposed to be keeping body and soul together by writing pornography , though this seemed incredible to Marjorie , because he was so sweet-natured , and so familiar with Ibsen 's plays . Marjorie finally decided to ease her conscience by trying any kind of paying work . She asked a starved blonde from Canada , who had just gone to work in Gorman 's department store , to help her get a job . The girl was skeptical ; Marjorie , sleek and furred , comfortably nested with her parents on ' West End Avenue , did n't seem to be salesgirl material . But Marjorie convinced her that she meant it . The girl took her to the personnel office , and Marjorie was readily inducted into the working class with a punch card . She was placed in the women 's underwear section , substituting for a girl who had mumps . For the first hour or so of the first day she worked at Gorman 's , Marjorie really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her ease in the black dress of a salesgirl on the wrong side of a counter , while women in hats and coats thronged by noisily , looking preoccupiedand mean . It was gay to make change , to chirp brightly about nightgowns and panties to customers , to crouch and search around in the stacks of boxes , to fill out sales slips with a sharp fresh-smelling pencil . She was , in fact , Katharine Hepburn , playing a store clerk in the first reel of a smart comedy . The trouble was that the young millionaire played by Gary Cooper did n't show up . Instead a stringy rouged woman in an old squirrel coat lost patience with Marjorie 's ignorance and began squawking insults at her , and Marjorie answered angrily , and the woman yelled for the section manager , and Mr. Meredith descended with a smile on his mouth and a glare in his eyes . Marjorie got a sharp hissed reprimand . Mr. Meredith apologized to the hag , while Marjorie sulked at the other end of the counter , feeling spat upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day and the next and the next , and all the days she served in the store , the job was nothing but exasperating drudgery through a long day under a paralyzed clock ; daily it gave her a tired spine , aching feet , rubbed nerves , and a growing hatred of women . Mr. Meredith , her section manager , began keeping her after hours to teach her about the bewildering stockpiles of underwear . he was a tall mustached man of about fifty with waxy pink good looks , a fetid breath vainly masked by wintergreen drops , and a continual false smile . Marjorie found it decidedly queer to go rummaging through piles of frilly lingerie with Mr. Meredith , and to listen while he fingered brassieres and slips and talked about them . But she put up with it . The reward at the end of the week for all this slavery was twelve dollars . Her father had been giving her half that much each week just for being his daughter . But she brought the pay envelope home with some pride.  |p299Mr.  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter 's new self-reliance . The father seemed saddened . " Does my daughter , " he said , " have to work as a clerk selling underwear ? Are things that bad in this house ? " Mrs. Morgenstern said that Marjorie was a fool to drudge in a department store when she could make more money with less effort working for her father . Marjorie could n't very well explain to her parents that the Arnold Importing Company seemed to her a black pit which would swallow her forever , once she fell in . She said , " I thought you wanted me to be useful , earn my own keep  --  " " I do n't know what 's the matter with you , " the mother said . " You do everythingbackwards and sideways . You 're a stenographer . Papa needs another girl in the place . Twenty dollars a week . So you work like a horse for twelve dollars a week in Gorman 's behind a counter . " " Do n't you see that working for Dad would n't count , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled her eyes toward the ceiling . " If I had a college education maybe I would follow you . When I went to school , twenty was eight more than twelve . " It was a heavy effort to get herself to answer the alarm clock and go down to the store , and the fact that her virtue went unrecognized made it harder . She arrived at Gorman 's the following Monday already on edge from a breakfastwrangle with her mother , wherein she had finally been driven to exclaimthat becoming a stenographer in the Arnold firm was the fate she most feared . Mr. Meredith , who had an eerie way of popping at Marjorie around pillars and corners , flashing his false smile , especially when she was being rude to some unbearable customer , chose this morning to do an extraordinary amount of popping . Also , the girl who had had the mumps returned to work , and showed instant jealousy , fear , and hatred of Marjorie . She sneered at her mistakes , snarled at her when she leaned on the counter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up the stock so that it would never get straight again . She was a fat girl named Viola , with a short upper lip and two large front teeth . The lunch in the clerks ' cafeteria , greasy meatballs and spaghetti , disagreed with Marjorie , shaky as she was . After lunch Mr. Meredith , with an odd change of manner , came fawning around , and started to talk to her about yoga exercises . He recommended a couple of books , and suggested that Marjorie might like to come with him to a meeting of his yoga group . He talked on and on , at very short range , overwhelming Marjorie with bad breath and wintergreen . Her head ached as though a tomahawk were sunk in it . Far down the counter the fat girl glared and glared ; at last she came up with a look of fixed hate , and broke in to whine to Mr. Meredith about a mess in the stock which Marjorie had made . They both went out of sight around the corner of the counter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She left the floor , went to her locker , got her coat , and walked out into the sunshine . She never even shopped in Gorman 's again . But she remembered Mr. Meredith and Viola for years afterward , with extreme vividness , as though she had worked with them half a lifetime.
