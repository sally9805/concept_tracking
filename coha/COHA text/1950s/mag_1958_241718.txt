U.S. 66 is the path of a people in flight , refugees from dust and shrinking land . . . they come into 66 from the tributary side roads , from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads . 66 is the mother road , the road of flight . <P> - The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck <P> The time was the early 1930s . Dust-parched , drought-wrung , a steady caravan of humans clattered west over U.S. 66 . Piled high in antiquated jalopies and steaming trucks were the precious things of their lives : children , a tacky mattress or two , tattered blankets , a stick of old furniture , cooking utensils , a flap of canvas . Behind them , in Oklahoma , Texas , Kansas , Missouri , lay the dead land of the drought . Ahead , at the end of the road of flight : California , the rich , full , well-watered San Joaquin Valley , where vast orchards and fields seemed magically alive with grapes , potatoes , peaches , cotton . Those were the bad years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desolate , they moved from harvest to harvest-scrounging food for emaciated children , bedding down in farm shacks or U.S. Government emergency camps , harried by highway patrolmen and sheriffs ' deputies-to become a symbol in fact and fiction of the desperate injustices wrought by drought and Depression . <P> Last week , a full quarter-century later , the San Joaquin Valley was thriving , and the Okies were thriving . In Bakersfield , Fresno , Visalia , Modesto , the Okies were Californians , still speaking the accents of the Southwest , still voting Democratic , clapping their hands to the hillbilly music of their favorite TV entertainer ( ' ' Cousin " Herb Henson ) , still whacking away at religion , Bible-belt style ( Scotch-taped legend on one Oklahoma car : OBEY Acts 2:38 ) . They had , most of them , made good-so good that nobody even thought to ask , " Whatever became of the Okies ? " <P> Cooks &; Giants . Over the years they worked in the rich fields , got jobs as salesmen , short-order cooks , orange-juice stand attendants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and farms , raised good crops , joined Rotary Clubs , sent their sons to become lawyers , accountants , teachers . <P> B. F. ( for Bernice Frederick ) Sisk , 47 , rolled into the valley from Texas in 1937 , took the first job he could find-thinning nectarines near Visalia-and saved enough to send for his wife and baby . He was elected in 1954 ( and again in 1956 ) to the U.S. House of Representatives . <P> Paul Peoples , who was eleven when his family drove in from Arkansas in a 1929 Overland Whippet , picked cotton , waited anxiously with his mother and three brothers each Saturday to learn if his father had made enough money for groceries . Today Peoples , 32 , is a graduate of Fresno State College , works on his master 's degree , and is Fresno 's deputy probation officer . " There were two kinds of people then , " he recalls . " Those who had never had a desire to improve themselves - and those who were looking for some way to better their lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't chew tobacco . There was n't any reason he could n't hold his head up and look any man straight in the eye . "
