For years the propagandists of Peking and Formosa have fought a subsurface battle for the loyalties of Thailand 's 3,000,000-odd Chinese . Even though the Communist Party is outlawed by the Thais , the victories mostly seemed to go to the Communists . Afraid of being caught on the wrong side , impressed by Red China 's military powers , and on occasion intimidated by ominous warnings from the underground , Chinese oldsters in Thailand have been persuaded to be either cautiously closemouthed or openly sympathetic to the Reds . The biggest victories of all have been won on the impressionable battleground of youthful minds . <P> Crowded together in Bangkok 's cluttered slums , laboring for long hours each day in the city 's markets , shops and factories , Thailand 's young Chinese are eager for learning and enlightenment . They band together in hundreds of small groups to discuss art , literature , music and the world of ideas . Many a shrewd Communist has been able to plant his ideas in fertile soil . With the battle all but lost in this vital salient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help to Formosa . Their answer came in the form of a fat , jovial , 43-year-old music teacher named Chu Yung-chen . <P> An accomplished singer , composer and conductor , Chu had a special knack for getting along with the young . Soon after his arrival in Bangkok , they were flocking by the hundreds to listen to his lectures and to hear him play and sing . Chu extended his visitor 's visa and took up more or less permanent residence at the leading Chinese anti-Communist headquarters . <P> One night a fortnight ago , after an exceptionally crowded meeting at the headquarters building , during which his young enthusiasts had kept him answering questions about musical theory until well after 11 p.m. , Chu went upstairs to the small room he used as a bedchamber . A few hours later , a passer-by noticed flames spurting from the lower floors of the all but empty building . He raced to turn in an alarm , but by the time the firemen arrived the whole place was ablaze . Cut off from escape by the collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . Thai police could not prove that the building had been purposely set afire ; in fact , the local Chinese community found in the event new reason for saying nothing at all .
