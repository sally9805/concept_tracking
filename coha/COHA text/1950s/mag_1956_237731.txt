To shake and perhaps shatter that system or to seek gains from threatening to do so , is not a triumph , neither does it augment grandeur . The Suez Canal , by reason of its internationalized character , both in law and in fact , is the last place wherein to seek the means of gaining national triumphs . " He made passing reference to Nasser 's much quoted Philosophy of the Revolution ( see box ) and its implicit threat of an Arab withholding of oil , " the sinew of material civilization without which machines would cease to function . " To guard against such threats , Dulles proposed an international board to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
