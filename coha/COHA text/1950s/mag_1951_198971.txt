How come Premier Mohammed Mossadeq keels over so often ? As every newspaper reader knows , he is prone to fainting fits , weeping or taking to his bed . What ails the man ? <P> When he arrived in Manhattan to put Iran 's case before the U.N. , he checked in at a hospital instead of a hotel . After seven days on the 16th floor of the huge New York Hospital , Patient Mossadeq was discharged . The doctors ' verdict , as reported by the Premier 's physician-son , Gholam Mossadeq : there is nothing wrong with him that a good rest , regular meals and regular sleep wo n't cure . In the U.S. , he has been getting all three . <P> Electrocardiograms of the 70-year-old Premier were normal ; all the X rays , blood tests and urinalyses were negative . The only exceptions to the doctors ' clean bill of health : a mild anemia , slight deafness and rather low blood pressure ( 100 systolic ) . His only treatment : vitamins . <P> Many a man with Mossadeq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Dr. Gholam Mossadeq , his father has n't had one since his youth . Now he is the ulcer type , without the ulcer . <P> His public faints ( caused by an inadequate supply of blood to the brain ) are the result of his excitability , coupled with his low blood pressure and habitual overwork . Says Gholam Mossadeq : " My father is not really ill-just nervous and tired from too much work . In Teheran he works from 6 in the morning until n at night . " <P> With his U.N . task ( and Manhattan rest cure ) at an end , Premier Mossadeq plans to head back to Teheran and overwork this week . <P> <P> *Ambassador Ernest Gross , U.S. delegate to U.N .
