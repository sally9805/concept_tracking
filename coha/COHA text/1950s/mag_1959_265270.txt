MY FATHERS AND I ( 253 pp. ) - Eric Linklater-Harcourt , Brace ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> British Novelist Eric Linklater ( Juan in America , Laxdale Hall ) wore the kilt of the gallant Black Watch in World War I and has laughed in the face of reality ever since . His new novel , My Fathers and I , is an escape into the past . It is told by a degenerate descendant of proud ancestors who were greatly absurd but greatly revered . The narrator is Edward G. ( for Gratiano ) Vanbrugh , a seedily broke antique dealer in a shabby English provincial town . His principal stock , symbolically enough , was a menagerie of Staffordshire China figures-shepherdesses , sailors , heroes of the past . As his narrative unfolds , it turns into a gallery of historical portraits redone by a modern caricaturist . <P> All the Vanbrughs made fools of themselves in one way or another , but they did so in the grand manner . There was Eustace Vanbrugh ( born 1834 ) , a truly Victorian loony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the servant class has disappeared only to re-emerge as civil servants taking revenge , in the name of socialism , on their former masters . ) Eustace 's lunacy revolved around the theological implications of Charles Darwin 's Origin of Species . He would bribe maidservants with a guinea in order to investigate whether or not they had tails : discovery of a vestigial caudal appendage of course would help the Darwinian faction . His scientific passion caused his social ruin during the visit of a German grand duchess whose family was reputed to be fitted with a Darwinian decoration . <P> Most of the other Vanbrughs had their troubles with women , too . Francis Vanbrugh ( born 1772 ) was a frail and handsome man given to fainting fits , who spent ten long years being hopelessly in love with the proud Duchess of Avalon . When she finally capitulated and came to his room , Francis , " maladroit as ever , " took the occasion to die . Then there was Thomas Vanbrugh ( born 1861 ) , a captain in Prince Albert 's Regiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a native uprising when he ordered a retreat solely to save the local British Resident 's wife , a dauntless lady with a superior figure . Finally , there was Edward Vanbrugh ( born 1891 ) , the narrator 's own father , who returned after long and distinguished service in World War I to a wife whom he had known only three days . She met him at Victoria Station , and the two went off for two blissful nights in the Regent Palace Hotel . Only after he left her did she realize that Edward had not recognized her at all and had left 50 on the mantelpiece . <P> As for the modern Vanbrugh who tells the story , he is a nobody , but he has a spy 's eye for survival , the derisive eloquence of a shameless man and the bogus kind of face that , as he suggests , would go well on a butler or a bishop . As Author Linklater tells it in his savagely comic novel , Vanbrugh spent a profitable war as a wingless wing commander in the R.A.F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household of a Texas aristocrat . Says he : " I see my destiny , I recognize my genius ... but England , I have not abandoned you . No more than Clive or Hastings , Raffles or Lugard . . . have I deserted you ! " <P> Author Linklater 's moral is clear : the past may be laughable , but the present is beneath contempt .
