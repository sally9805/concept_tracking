One fact emerged last week as plain and sharp as a good photograph : no disarmament agreement is going to be signed in London 's Lancaster House this summer . Valerian Zorin . Soviet delegate , took care of that at the 61st gathering this year around the green table . To the four Western nations , this was the moment for Zorin to reply to John Foster Dulles ' proposals for aerial zones of inspection ( TIME , Aug. 12 ) . But . after complaining that the Dulles proposal failed to include all U.S. bases in Asia and Africa , Zorin returned to two of the most tired themes of Soviet propaganda : if there is to be disarmament , all NATO and Communist Warsaw Pact troops must be withdrawn from foreign soil in Europe , and all foreign military bases must be liquidated . He reiterated the Soviet insistence on a quick three-stage reduction of armed forces . <P> If Zorin really meant what he said about withdrawing foreign troops , there was little hope of agreement . The U.S. and Britain have repeatedly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political issues which necessitated arming in the first place , and they have specifically assured Chancellor Konrad Adenauer that German reunification is one such issue . <P> The U.S. , British . French and Canadian delegations interpreted Zorin 's remarks as propaganda aimed at next month 's German elections . It was obvious that until after Germany votes , the public meetings in London are going to prove little . Even the ever-ebullient U.S. Negotiator Harold Stassen seemed a little discouraged after Soviet Delegate Zorin declared , " The optimistic picture that Mr. Stassen painted for us far from exists . "
