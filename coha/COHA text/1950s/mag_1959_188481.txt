" We are not interested in producing well-rounded men , but men with sharp , abrasive edges-rebels with clear minds and uncowed consciences , critics of society , not adjusters to it . " The words would have a stirring ring coming from any educator , but they take on added meaning coming from the dean of faculty of a new public college spun off by big ( 20,000 students ) Michigan State University , long known as an " ag and tech " institution . Last week , at the opening of the new college at Oakland , 60 miles east of M.S.U. 's main East Lansing campus , crewcut Dean Robert Hoopes , 39 , onetime Marine Corps aviator , laid out his goal : to teach the art of living as well as pure knowledge . Said he to M.S.U.Oakland 's first 500 students ( all freshmen ) : " What is success ? What is good ? What do I want ? Where am I going ? You are in college to seek answers to those questions , and the first thing to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nucleus of a Dream . Michigan State hopes to get to the goal by developing a top-drawer liberal arts college to match its excellent technical schools . Oakland has the plant and the men for a good start . Most of the sweeping 2,000-acre campus was given to M.S.U. two years ago by the widow of Auto Tycoon John Dodge and her husband , Lumberman Alfred G. Wilson . Value of the land and the 125-room Wilson mansion : about $15 million . When the Wilsons added another $2,000,000 to the gift , astute M.S.U. President John Hannah appointed Vice President Durward B. Varner , 42 , as chancellor and gave him the job of turning Oakland into a dream college . Varner recruited 25 of the nation 's best young teachers ( average age : 33 ) as the nucleus of his faculty ; almost all are Ph.D.s v. an average of 30% in other colleges . He managed to pry $670 , - ooo out of the money-strapped Michigan legislature to pay the first year 's salaries and maintenance , and with help from some of the country 's top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will shun short-term specialization , emphasize principles that endure through technological changes . Oakland will offer degrees in only four fields : liberal arts , engineering , business , teaching . Every student will devote half his time to humanities , spend a full year studying the Far East , Middle East , Africa and Latin America . Engineers must master one foreign language , preferably Russian , and all seniors will take a " great issues " course together . <P> Oakland 's first students ( 60% in the top quarter of their high school classes ) may find the experience a bit prickly . All must live off campus ; no dormitories have yet been built . The school will have no fraternities , sororities , ROTC or remedial courses . The only athletics will be voluntary and for fun . <P> Independent Study . Mental effort is another matter . Says Dean Hoopes , sometime English teacher at Harvard , Yale and Stanford : " To a degree probably unmatched anywhere in this country , the students will find themselves responsible for their own education through independent study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest possible moment . Our university is a place of the mind , and the mind is an activity , not a repository . In this spirit we invite students to come and learn with us. "
