As speaker-in-chief of the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner ( East Coast division ) last week , Adlai Stevenson had to do a couple of jobs which many Democrats still found passing strange after all their years in office : 1 ) help get his own party out of hock , and 2 ) take a critical look at the party in power . He attracted 1,400 of the faithful into the ballroom of Philadelphia 's Bellevue-Stratford Hotel at $100 a head . There they heard Stevenson use his gift for bright English to express an exceedingly dim view of the state of the world-especially that part of it affected by the fact that the Republicans now hold power in the U.S. <P> " I should like . . . to thank President Eisenhower for the initiative he has taken this week with respect to atomic materials and for his forthright reaffirmation of our desire for peaceful . . . relations with the Russian people , " he said . But , Stevenson went on , " while he speaks of unity his colleagues sow disunity . While he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Where are Franklin Roosevelt 's Four Freedoms today ? Who speaks for them now ? <P> " Those gallant hopes of yesterday have given way to the sorry confusion of today . They have been replaced by the four fears-fear of depression ; fear of Communism ; fear of ourselves ; fear , if you please , of freedom itself . " Stevenson did not name Senator McCarthy during an obvious attack on Mc-Carthyism , in which , he charged , " the Bill of Rights is besieged , ancient liberties infringed . " He did , however , mention Attorney General Herbert Brownell , " the chief law-enforcement officer of the nation , the very embodiment of our concept of justice , who has even imputed disloyalty or Communist sympathy to a former President while our allies . . . listen in bewilderment and disgust . " <P> As for U.S. fear of a depression , Stevenson suggested that a depression , if it materialized , would be unnecessary and " man-made , " the Democrats having already proved that " Americans could master their own economic destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was long the privilege of the G.O.P.-visualizing the beneficial results to accrue from turning the bunglers of today out of office . After that , said Stevenson , " I see the U.S. united in high endeavors , standing once again before the world calm , wise and resolute , a beacon of hope , a citadel of fortitude-and of faith . "
