you get tired you can sit on top of the high fence there . You may be better there anyway . Too bad you did n't wear Texas boots , the heels hook in better . A million pairs at the house . Tomaso will look after you . I 'll be back . Here , take this . You 'll need it . Across your face . " He tossed her his handkerchief and was off into the melee , a figure of steel and iron and muscle . Cattle . So close-packed that it seemed you could walk on their backs for a mile  --  for miles as far as the eye could see . From the little sand hills , from the mesquite motts and the cactus came the living streams , a river here a river there , a river of moving flesh wherever the eye rested , and these sluggish lines were added to the great central pool until it became a Mississippi of cattle fed by its smaller tributaries . Little figures on horseback guided the course of these streams . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had said , " She 's been the point so long she ca n't get used to being the drag . " These little figures on horseback formed a triangle , and there in front was the point and there at the rear ends the drag . To the east the west and the south these tiny dots on horseback moved the rivers of red and white Herefords , the torrents of cattle with the white clown faces and the pink-rimmed eyes . The bawling of the calves , the bellowing of the cows was earsplitting . Now it was almost impossible to see through the dense clouds of dust . The men wore handkerchiefs tied in a triangle before their faces so that only their eyes were free . Leslie took the big handkerchief that Jordan had tossed to her , she tied it so that her nose and mouth were covered , a Moslem woman in riding clothes . The animals moved closepacked . Curtain on curtain of dust , the men on horseback the men running about on foot were ghostly figures in a fog of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders seemed not riders at all but centaurs part horse part man , swaying with the animals as though they were one body . They rode headlong into the herd , they seemed not even to touch the reins , they swung slightly in the saddle as the horse wove in and out like a fluid thing . You saw how this weavingp201movement of man and horse separated the bawling calf from its mother , the high plaintive blatting becoming more anguished as the animal sought frantically to return to the seething mass . Wide-eyed , breathless , Leslie watched this ancient process , unchangedfor centuries . These men leaped off their horses , threw the struggling calf and roped him , were on the horse again in a swift single leap and off into the surging herd . As they rode you heard them calling softly , tenderly , quieting the milling frantic sea of cattle . Woo woo woo vaca ! Woo woo woo novillo . Woo vaca . Woo woo woo ! Like a mother humming to her restless child . To Leslie it was a legendary scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A welter of noise , confusion ; the stench of singeing hair and burned flesh . Perched on the corral fence with Tomaso as bodyguard , her heels hooked on a lower rail , she began slowly to comprehend that in this gigantic melee of rounding-up , separating , branding , castrating there was order ; and in that order exquisite timing and actually a kind of art . Here , working with what seemed to her unbelievable courage and expertness , were men riding running leaping ; wrestling with huge animals ten times their size ; men slim heavy tall short young old bronze copper tan lemon black white . Here was a craft that had in it comedy and tragedy ; that had endured for centuries and changed but little in those centuries . Bick had said , just before he left her with Tomaso , " This is going to be pretty rough , Leslie . I do n't want to see you keeling off that fence . " " I promise you I wo n't do that again . I 'm a big girl now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told herself with mixed feelings of pride and resentment as she watched him  --  working in this inferno of heaving flesh and choking dust and noise and movement and daring and danger and brutal beauty . Working like any one of the vaqueros amidst hoofs and flanks and horns . A ballet , she said to herself . A violent beautiful ballet of America . Idiotically she turned to Tomaso . " Could n't it be done somep202other way ? Without all this danger and I mean not so many  --  thousands and thousands " Yo no comprendo , senora , " said Tomaso , sorrowfully . She thought she recognized two or three of the men as among those who had been drawn up so proudly in line at the gates as she and Bick had entered Reata  --  when was it ?  --  yesterday ? The day before ? A week a month ago ? It seemed something far in the past . It was easy to recognize Polo with his air of authority , his unique elegance , the white teeth in that dark fine-boned face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a king would have . The night of their arrival she had happened to speak again of Polo and his dramatic vaqueros and Bick had said , " Old Polo 's practically part of the family . When he was a boy he used to sleep outside my father 's door . " Startled , she had said , " How do you mean  --  outside his door ? " " On the floor in the hall . " " Good heavens , why ! " " I do n't know . They do . His son slept outside my door when I was a kid . For that matter , they still do , I suppose . Tomaso or one of the boys around the house . " " Now ! " She was aghast . " They 're not there when I come in and they 're gone when I get up . It 's been going on for a century . I think it 's pretty damned foolish , myself . " " Foolish ! It 's feudal ! It 's uncivi " Now , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the look on your face . I 'd give anything to know what you 're thinking , Yanqui . " " I was just reassuring myself by thinking of awfully American things . Like pork and beans . And Fourth of July . And Vermont . And pumpkin pie . And Fords . And Sunday school . And cocky Midwestern hired girls in Ohio , when I was a child . " " This is what I call American , " he had said . In a far corner out of the dust of battle old Rosendo had set up a tarpaulin , the chuck wagon was backed handily at its edge.  |p203The  wind wafted the scent of his cooking to the scene of feverish activity but it was lost in the stench of the branding . Calves bawled , cows bellowed , men yelled , hoofs pounded , gates slammed , flesh burned , irons clanged , dust swirled , sun glared . Leslie Benedict clung to the fence rail and knew why Texans paid fifty dollars for great cool sheltering ten-gallon Stetson hats . Up clattered Bick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , honey ? " " Fine . I want to ask questions . " " I was afraid of that . " He pulled his horse up beside her there at the fence . " Hungry ? " She wrinkled her nose . " No . " " You will be when you get to the camp . Old Rosendo 's part Mexican part Negro part Indian , he 's a real cook , we 'd have him up at the house kitchen but he wo n't work indoors . " " What can he cook under that little pocket handkerchief of a tent ? " " You wait . You 'll see . " " Everybody talks Spanish . Tell me , that 's Polo , is n't it , who was so splendid and dressy to welcome us . " " Yes . Polo 's caporal . Foreman . " " What 's he doing ? He and the others . It looks cruel but I suppose it is n't . " " Not if America wants to cat . They 're roping . And branding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ropers do that . The others  --  the men who are throwing the calves  --  they 're called tumbadores . It 's a great trick , throwing a calf , there 's less to it than meets the eye , really . It looks like a feat of strength but they 're not really lifting those calves . You squeeze the calf 's ear , it jumps , you pull him sideways and he falls flat on his right side with his left side up , ready for branding . Over there 's the brandingfire . And those fellows who run the brands , they 're really specialists . Marcadores , they 're called . " " Marcadores . A lovely word . For such a nasty job . What 's it mean ? "  | " Figure it for yourself , really . Marcar means to mark  --  to stamp  --  to brand . Marcadores  --  markers , branders . It 's tricky work . Those irons are red-hot . It 's the Reata brand , of course . If they press too hard the calves get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand wo n't be clear . They 're dehorning too , those other fellows . " " It seems horrible but perhaps it is n't . What are those boys doing ? The ones with the sticks and the buckets ? " " They 're atoleros . Atole  --  well , mush . They 've got a kind of lime paste in those buckets , they have rags wrapped around those sticks and they smear the lime on the fresh burns to heal them . . . . Well , you wanted to come . " " Do n't you worry about me . I 'm tougher than I was yesterday . I 'm a tough Texan . Go on . " He grinned . " Well , brace yourself . You wo n't like what comes next . " " The one who 's doing something to their ears and " And castrating the male calves . He 's the capador . He castrates the males and that makes them steers . And he nicks a piece off the end of the left ear of male and female and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ear with a hole and a slit , for identification . At the end of the day he adds up , and the number of pieces of ear in his pocket shows the number of calves we 've branded . " " Jordan Benedict , I 'll never eat roast beef again as long as I live . " " Oh , yes you will . " " Do n't tell me that 's what you 've planned for lunch ! " " No . Rest easy . It 's chicken and Rosendo 's apple pie . " " It just may be I 'll never eat anything again . . . . Look , there 's a darling little boy putting something in a bucket . Gatheringup and putting  --  why , he ca n't be more than ten years old . What 's he bringing to the fire in the bucket ? " Matter-of-factly Bick said , " That 's little Bobby Dietz , his father is ranch boss on Number One . "  | " But what 's he doing ? " " Well , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of your life . He 's picking up the testicles of the castrated calves . The tumbadores roast them on the coals , they burst open and they eat them as you 'd eat a roast oyster , they 're very tasty really and the vaqueros think they make you potent and strong as a bull . They 're considered quite a dainty . . . . Come on , honey , it 's time for lunch . Here 's Tomaso with your horse . And listen  --  there 's Rosendo 's bell . " " Why do n't the men stop working ? I should think they 'd be famished . " " They 'll eat after we 've finished . " On their way to the dinner camp they passed the fire of hot embers and she averted her eyes and then forced herself to look , and to smile . And at Bick 's call the little lad came running to their horses , he came shyly , a handsome boy with very blue eyes bluer in contrast with the sun-browned face . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where 's your father ? " " He went back there in the draw , he says there 's a bunch there the boys missed . " " Does , eh ? " Bick looked at Leslie . " This kid comes of good stuff . He 'll make a wonderful hand when he grows up . What are you going to be when you get to be a man , Bobby ? A cowboy ? " " I 'm going to be a Ranger , and shoot people . " " Not me ! " " No . Bad people . " " Bobby , this is Mrs. Benedict . This is the new senora . " The deep blue eyes were turned on her like searchlights . " What she wearing them funny clothes for ? " Bick grinned . " She has n't had time to get some Texas clothes . " And away they cantered from the little boy and his macabre task , but not so far after all , they were to discover twenty-five years later.  |p206Though  ten minutes before she had been repelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , Leslie now found herself eating Rosendo 's food with relish , not to say gusto . Having polished off chicken , string beans , apple pie and half a disk of skillet bread she inspected the chuck wagon with its orderly compartments for spices , flour , beans , rice , cutlery , tinware . She complimented the gifted Rosendo and was enchanted with the benign and wrinkled face beneath the vast straw sombrero . She felt well and buoyant of spirits . " Let me stay this afternoon and come home with you . I 'm not tired . " " Two more hours of sun and you 'd wish you had n't . " " I could steal a nap here under the canvas . " " Even a Mexican could n't sleep under this canvas at noon . " In the burning sun the men were sitting on the ground scooping up their beans and red rice , spooning up molasses and wiping their plates with hunks of bread torn from the great disks stacked on the tent table . Certainly they seemed much less dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the animals they tended . Sitting there with her husband under the scrap of unavailing canvas the gently bred girl was trying to arrange in her mind a pattern that would bring order into the kaleidoscope of these past three days . Gropingly , as though thinking aloud , she said , " In Washington and in New York and in Chicago and Detroit and Columbus men get up and take a streetcar or a bus or an automobile and go to work in offices and shops and factories , they write things down , they push a lever , they go to a restaurant and eat lunch and come back to work and weigh something or add up something or sell something or dictate something , and they go home . And that is a day 's work . But this ! " " Now what ? What 's the matter with this ? " " It 's incredible , that 's all . I ca n't believe that men earn their living this way . It 's too difficult . Why , just look at Polo ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Nothing , darling . I just mean  --  look at him on his horse , he looks like a Spanish grandee . I 've never seen a Spanish grandee but did Polo do all these circus stunts when he was a young man ? " " He sure enough did . Top hand . That 's how he got to be caporal . He can still do them , and better than men half his age . " " How old is he ? " " Nobody knows . I doubt that he does himself . But he 's getting too old for this job . And too old-fashioned . Would you believe he keeps his accounts in his head ! Hours , wages , stock counts . They always tally , he 's never been wrong , no one 's ever been able to solve his system of mathematics , but it 's infallible . It ca n't go on , though . I 'll have to retire him and put in a modern system like that in the other divisions . I 've humored him long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others on the sub-ject ! " " Why do n't they run the ranch , then ? " His head came up , his jaw set , his whole aspect changed as though he had been challenged . " I run this ranch . Do n't make any mistake about that . " She looked at old Polo , seated so lightly on his beautiful horse . The vaqueros had finished their noonday meal , they were stretchingand yawning , one of them took a mouthful of water from a tin cup and spat it out on the ground in some sort of primitive ablution . " What will he do then ? " Bick was silent a moment . When he spoke he did not answer her question . " Polo put me on a horse when I was three . He taught us all to ride like the vaqueros , they 're the best horsemen in the world , the Mexican cowboys , they 're better than those Hungarians that used to show off in all that glitter at the Horse Show in New York . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eight she could ride like a charro . " Charro . Charro ? I ca n't ask questions every minute , I 'll buy a Spanish dictionary . " Dearest , do you work like this every day ? " " Well  --  no . No , I don't. "  | " I mean it 's wonderful that you can do it , but it 's ghastly rough and tough . " He actually blushed a little then beneath the russet burn , and he laughed rather sheepishly , like a boy . " Tell you the truth , honey , I was just showing off today in front of my girl . Like a kid chinning himself on the apple tree . " The men were mounting their horses , fresh horses she saw , from a great cluster of them she had not noticed until now , grazingagainst the horizon . " New horses ? Are they going to start all over again ? " " Sure , new horses . Or fresh , we 'd say . Every Benedict vaquero has got at least ten horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't noticed . They 'll be riding about five different horses each , today . See that bunch of horses over there ? That 's called a remuda . They 're what we call cutting horses . They 're used to cut out certain animals from the herd . Trained for it . You do n't even have to touch the reins half the time . Just sway your body and your horse will turn with your weight this way or that . " " Jordan ! I forgot all about My Mistake . These two or three days have been so new and strange  --  different I mean . I forgot about My Mistake . Is she here ? Where is she ? Do you think she 'll know me ? My girl friend from home in Virginny . She brought us together . She introduced us . I 'd never have met you without her . I love her . " " She 's out in pasture . Very queenly , with a canvas shade on poles in one corner if she finds Texas too hot . A six-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys has been exercising her a little every day to keep her in shape after the long trip down . I meant to tell you . Obregon there  --  over there , that tall fellow in the straw hat  --  had her out yesterday he says she 's the finest little " Oh , let me talk to him , will you ? I 'm homesick for her . Tonightwhen you get back let 's visit her . Or surely tomorrow . Will you ? I 'll have to write Lacey all about her . " Summoned , the man came toward them . He was noticeablyp209taller than the average and very slim , with broad shoulders like the American cowboys Leslie had seen in Western motion pictures . His skin was a deep copper color and yet under the skin were freckles , an extraordinary thing . A chin strap held the crimped straw sombrero . His hair was cut in little dandified sideburnsalong his ears . " Angel , " Bick said as the man came toward them . " Angel Obregon . " " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know his wife . Is he the one ? If he has a new baby he is . Yesterday  --  butthen you do n't know about it . " The man stood before them . Bick acknowledged his presence with his charming smile and an openhanded gesture as he said , " Un minuto , Angel . " He went on speaking to Leslie , his manner leisurely . " The Mexican Obregons stem from some long-ago Irishman named O'Brien . That 's the story , anyway . The Irish came in here in 1845 , you know , section hands working on the new railroad , and a lot of them married Mexican Indian girls . Look at those shoulders . He inherited those from some **25;6588;TOOLONG named O'Brien . Three generations in Mexico made him an Obregon . Look at the Irish freckles under the copperskin . " " Jordan , he ca n't like it  --  standing there while you talk about him as if he were a  --  a -- one of your bulls . " " He does n't speak English . Look , Leslie , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the man . " The little filly you exercisedyesterday , " he said in Spanish , " is a great favorite of the senora . The horse is her own . She has great feeling for the horse . " The man 's face flashed into sudden radiance , he began to speak , the words rolling out with a great drumming of Spanish Rs . " He says she is a miracle of a horse , that she is swifter than any horse in Texas but she is not happy , he says perhaps she longs for her home . " A little involuntary cry came from Leslie . " Oh , Jordan , I must see her . She 's homesick for Virginia . I want to put my arms around her neck and comfort her . "  | " Yes , " said Bick stiffly . Obregon was speaking again , his hat was in his hand , he was speaking directly to Leslie in a flood of Spanish , the dark eyes glowing down upon her . Helplessly she smiled up at the ardent face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed his own inability to understand her , " No comprendo , " she said triumphantly . Bick stood up . " He is thanking you for being so kind to his wife yesterday . He says you have worked a miracle , his wife is much improved , his infant son  --  say what is all this , anyway ! I ca n't have you messing around with But she sprang up , impulsively she laid her hand on the man 's arm . " Oh , I 'm so glad . Tell her I 'll be in to see her again , I 'll bring her some delicious things and something for the baby . " " The hell you will ! . . . That is all , Obregon . To work now . " The man turned away , was off , he mounted his horse for the afternoon 's work with the others . The siesta was finished . The man and woman stared at each other . " Not again , " Leslie said . He came close to her . " You just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole Southwest looks after its people better than we do . But you do n't know these people . They 're full of superstitionsand legends . They believe in the evil eye and witchcraft and every damn thing . " " But he did n't say my eye was evil . " " It was just luck he did n't . If the child or the girl had turned sicker instead of better it would have been because you looked at them . They 've got a whole lingo about pregnant women and newborn babies and all that Mexican stuff . You just do n't know , honey . Look , the Hake ranch uses some vaqueros . Ask Vashti next time you see her , if you think Luz and I are  --  feudal , was n't it ? " A dot had been scurrying like a bug across the prairie . Now it came closer , it spun around in a spiral of dust , it stopped with a yip and a grinding of brakes . The calves ran bleating and scattering . The cattle leaped in terror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn that lout ! " Bick said . " If he ever runs down one of those calves I 'll beat him up myself . " Jett Rink leaped out and yelled to the world in general , " You et ? " " Si . " " I ai n't . " He heaped a plate with beans stew rice bread and squatting on his haunches he ate the boiling-hot mess in the boiling-hot sun . " You 're late , " Bick said . " It ai n't me . I had to catch that horse for Madama . " " What horse ? " " That new one . My Mistake . She wanted to ride her . " " She ca n't , " Leslie cried , and there was outrage in her voice . " She ca n't ! My Mistake 's a race horse . " " She 's riding her , " Jett said coolly , and heaped his plate again with the steaming stew . " She sure hated to put on that Western saddle , that little filly did . Took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could ride a bat outa hell . " A trifle worriedly Bick said , " It 's all right , Leslie . Luz can ride any four-legged thing . " Abruptly he turned to Rink . " Eat your dinner and get going . I want Mrs. Benedict out of this heat . " Jett shoveled the food into his mouth , he gulped and swallowed and wiped his face with his sleeve . He coughed and choked a little . He burst into laughter . " Wait till you see her . " Bick turned back , stared . " See her ! See who ? " " Madama . She 's riding My Mistake way here . She darned near kept up with me in the car , there for a stretch . " " You 're crazy ! " " I ai n't the one . " Jett laughed again . " You know what else she done ? She rigged herself out in a old hoop skirt she got out of the attic , she said her grammaw could ride and rope in a hoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that outfit , rope and all , and she 's riding hell-bent this way , last I saw of her . I 'm surprised she ai n't here aready . Said not to tell you . Said she 'd show you . Acted like she was mad at something , the way she does . "  |p212Bick  took off his hat and ran his hand over his hot wet forehead . His eyes searched the endless plain . " Jordan , I want to stay . I want to wait till she comes . My Mistakeis n't used to this terrible  --  to the sun and the brush and that heavy Western saddle . I want to see if she 's all right . " Almost harshly he said , " You 'll go along with Jett . I 'll tend to Luz . Alone . I 'll have Angel ride My Mistake home . " " But she 'll have to rest first . My Mistake will have to rest . She is n't just a riding horse . A mile  --  two miles  --  three  --  but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . It 'll be all right , I tell you . I 'll send over to a line house  --  Dietz 's place  --  and get some of Mrs. Dietz 's riding stuff for Luz , take that damn masquerade off her . I 'll send her home on a horse out of the remuda there . No , I 'll put her on the horse you rode here . Gentle as a cow . That 'll teach her . " " And when will you be home , Jordan ? " " Oh , God , how do I know ! When my work 's done . " Two million acres . He works like a cow hand . I 've turned into a nagging wife asking her husband when he 'll be home . But this is all crazy . Nobody can say it is n't crazy as a nightmare . Hoop skirts and race horses and old-maid sisters with twisted souls . Her eyes followed Jordan 's gaze out across the miles of open range , past the heaving backs of milling cattle and the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . Fifty feet away Jett Rink got up , tossed his empty tin plate and cup into the heap , wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . Quietly Leslie said , " All right , Jordan . " She came close to him , she saw the sharp white ridge of the jaw muscle beneath the sunburnedskin . The blue eyes were flint-grey.  |p213ALMOST  GRATEFULLY she had sunk into the hot dusty front seat of the car . " I want to sit up front , " she had said to Bick , " so that I can see everything on the way home . " Bick on his horse at the side of the car had leaned over and touched her hand . " We 'll make a real Texian of you yet , honey . At that , I do n't know any Texas woman who could take the heat and ruckus better than you did . Unless it 's Luz . " " Nothing to see , up front , or back , " Jett Rink said . But they were oblivious of him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just what I meant . Yesterday , when that nice Doctor Tom asked me . " " You have n't seen anything . It 'll take you years . " " I know . And we 've got years . Is n't it lucky ! " Bick threw a quick glance around . He leaned far off his horse so that he was standing in one stirrup , his left hand on her shoulder , she leaned toward him he bent far forward into the car , and kissed her hard on the mouth . Instinctively she sensed or saw out of the corner of her eye that Jett Rink 's foot moved to press the accelerator , then stopped , poised . She knew that he had suppresseda sudden murderous impulse to start the car with a swift leap while Jordan hung perilously half on the horse , half in the car . Bick straightened , he turned in his saddle to look back at her as he rode away , his hand held high in farewell . He looked handsomeand vital . Suddenly Jett pressed the accelerator hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can I take her around by the other way , the long back road ? If she wants to see things , different things . " Bick looked down at them , hesitating . " Oh yes , Jordan , " Lesliesaid . " If it 's a different way . " Reluctantly he said , " Well , all right . But you , Jett , do n't you get any big touring notions in that empty sheepherder 's head of yours . " He grinned . " Put him in a car and he goes road-crazy . Last December he started out to take Cora Dart  --  that 's the schoolteacher  --  to the fiesta in Viento . Ended up at the Cowboy Christmas Ball at Anson in Jones County , better than two thirds the way up across Texas . " Jett 's grin was sour . " Sure . Vamos por la casa . That 's me . " They stared hard at each other . It was , Leslie thought , as though they hated one another and yet there was a kind of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at terrific speed over the vast bare terrain . But once the camp had dwindled in the distance they slowed down , Jett was driving at the merest horse-and-buggyjog.  | " You want to go round Benedict way , seeing you did n't make it walking yesterday ? " " How did you know I started to walk to town ? " " Like I told you , everybody knows everything anybody does around here . " Enough of that . " Where is the road  --  the highway ? You said you were taking the long road back . " " This here is it . " " But this is just a little wider than the one we took this morning with the horses . It is n't really a public road , is it ? " " No road . No road like that . I guess you do n't know how big this outfit is . The roads around Reata are Reata .

His eyes actually were bulging a little and his mouth muscles were drawn back in a snarl like that of the stuffed catamount'shead on the wall in the great hall . She began to regret the drive , she decided to ask no questions of this boor , since every utterance seemed to send him into a rage . They went along in silence , their speed now was frightening . He began to speak again , he spat out the words . " How 'd they come by it ! Millions of acres . Who gets hold of millions of acres without they took it off somebody ! " Here at last was Leslie 's chance to make use of that knowledge gained from books of Southwest lore over which she had so eagerly pored . She darted about in her mind for remembered facts , statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought by anyone who had the money . It was just like a deal in real estate .

" " That 's not true at least , not always , " Leslie retorted , a trifle surprised to find herself suddenly on the other side of the argument . " They often bought it and paid for it . " " Yeah . Five cents a acre . Say , you 're Bick 's wife , you ai n't supposedto go against a Benedict . " " I would if I thought they were wrong .

But perhaps she had only imagined it . " You 're not exactly loyal to your employer , are you , Jett ? " She saw his head turn on that thick pugnacious neck as he stared at her . She went on , lightly , conversationally , a polite half-smile of interest on her lips . " You talk so interestingly about other people 's background . Tell me a little about your own , will you ? Your childhood and your father and mother . Unless you 'd rather not . " " Why would n't I ! " he yelled belligerently .

Ma , she 's been dead since I was about two years old , I do n't remember her even , they was seven of us kids , I do n't know where they 're at , most of ' em . Pa , he went in one day around here with his gun to get him some birds for us kids to eat , I guess . Strictly not allowed . Private , those birds , and the air they fly in is private . He never come out . He never turned up again after he went in there with his gun . " " Maybe he went away . Sometimes people do that  --  they don'tp217mean to but the responsibility is too much for them , their minds just Now he turned squarely to look at her , his laugh was a short sharp yelp . " You sure got a lot to learn about Texas . " " I want to learn . I want to know about you and all the others on Reata . " " Yeh , well , we 're all doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially . If they do n't like it they can go back to Mexico and starve . I 'm real petted . Bick , he give me a few acres out Viento way . Real lovely . You could n't feed a three-legged calf off it . " " Jett , I find I 'm more tired than I thought . I 'd like to go straight home . " " You said you wanted to go see Benedict . " " I 've changed my mind . " " Say , I did n't go for to make you mad . You asked me and I told you straight out . If you did n't want to know you got no call to ask me . You want everything prettified up , that 's what 's the ' natter with you . " Stunned , the impact of this truth silenced her . They tore along the landscape , it seemed to Leslie that movement was reversed in some nightmarish way and that it was the car that stood still , the flat glaring plain that whirled past them like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance against the flat tin sky was etched the outline of Reata . " No ! " she said to her own astonishment . " No , let 's not go home just yet . " " The town ? " " Yes . " " The other side of Benedict  --  that 's why I come this way  --  is Nopal . " " What 's that ? " " Nothing . Only Mexicans . It 's Benedict only they call it Nopal like it 's another town . It 's like real Mexico , I do n't guess there 's two white people living there . " " White . You mean  --  but the Mexicans aren't --  "  | " They sure ai n't white , for my money . Two Americans then . Maybe you like that better . " Jordan told me  --  my husband told me that some of the Mexicanshad been there  --  their families , I mean  --  hundreds of years . Have n't you read your Texas history ! They were here long before you , or the Benedicts , or Reata , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're more American than you are ! " " God damn it to hell ! " he yelled . " You  --  if you was a man I 'd kill you for that . " His foot jammed down hard on the floorboard , they were tearing crazily along the ribbon of road . We are going to be killed , she thought . We must surely be killed . She sat quietly while the past day  --  the past week  --  this past strange changeful month of her life marched in orderly array through her mind . It was like reviewing some sort of noisy over-colorful and crowded party from which she was about to take leave as decently as possible . I must go , she said to an imaginary hostess . It 's been so interesting . Thanks for letting me come . They entered a down-at-heel little town , they had flashed past a broken road sign that said NOPAL . The car slid and bumped to a jolting halt in front of the dusty little plaza . Leslie lurched forward , slammed back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Blandly he said , " Nopal means a prickly-pear tree , it 's a kind of cactus . " She began to laugh a little hysterically . Then she stopped abruptly and sat silent a moment , her hands covering her eyes . When she brought her hands down they were fists . She pretended to look about her , she was conquering an almost overwhelming impulse to hit hard that heavy-jowled young face with the hard blue eyes set so close together . " Ai n't you feeling good , ma'am ? You like a drink or something , Miz Benedict ? " Furious , she said , " You drove like a maniac . If my husband knew you drove like that ! You 're out of your senses ! " " I did n't go for to scare you . That 's the way we drive in Texas . Everybody . " " I 'm going to get out and walk , " she said.  | " Sure , " he said , humbly for him . " But why n't you wait and drive around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town , nothing to see . Anyway , you do n't want to walk , do you , in them clothes ? What you always wanting to walk for ? " She glanced down at herself . Riding pants made by a Washingtontailor . She looked about her . The plaza , the streets were deserted except for a woman in black ascending the church steps , a black rebozo covering her head . " I want to telephone . " " I bet they ai n't a telephone in town only the priest 's house and maybe one two places you would n't go into . " He hesitated a moment . " Say , do n't be sore , Miz Benedict . I get mad easy . Uhdon'tget sore . " For a moment she thought he was going to blubber . Well , the boy was a lout and something of a brute , but here she was and being here it was silly not to see something of this bit of Mexico in the United States . Here was another civilization , a strange land within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or flat on the dirt ground . The dwellings pitted and seared and scoured by wind and sand and heat and sudden northers . Dusty oleanders like weeds by the roadside . Broken sidewalks , crazily leaning balconies , sagging porches . They were moving now , slowly , inching their way around the little bare plaza with the paintless bandstand in the center . Yet there was something about the town  --  a kind of decayed beauty . The church stood richly facing the plaza , its lirnestone and brick and stained-glass windows in startling contrast to the rest of the dilapidated little town . " That there 's the church , they call it a cathedral , I got to laugh . " Jett Rink had assumed the air of official though scornful  --  guide . " They do n't do anything different from what they ( lid a hundred years ago . Sundays you know what they do ? They walk . And Saturday night . The band plays and they act like they never heard of America . The girls walk up on one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they walk down on the other side and they ai n't allowed to talk to each other . They just lookp220at each other , they ca n't talk alone , they say it 's just like in Spain . . . . American ! I got to laugh . " A priest in his black strode across the plaza and disappeared within the neat limestone house beside the church . A little velveteyedgirl ran through the quiet street , she glanced shyly at the car parked there at the plaza 's edge . A rickety cart trundled by , a cask on wheels , it was the cart that sold water to the Mexican households in this dry land . . . . Dim wineshops . The C.O.D . cafe . Garza 's Place . . . Rutted roads of white shell . . . Dusty footpaths leading to the church . " They ai n't changed , those dopes , the way they eat and live and all . They make their cinches of horse manes , by hand , like they did a hundred years ago , and reatas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckskin . They stick together and ca n't even talk English , half of ' em . Go around solemn-looking on the outside , but boy ! when they get together ! Dancing and singing their corridos telling about everything they do , like a bunch of kids . " " People do that , you know . They cling together when they feel frightened or unsafe . " EMILIO HAWKINS said a sign tacked crazily outside a grocery . ' There ! Is that one of your two Americans ? " " Half-and-half . " A dapper figure emerged from Garza 's Place . Glistening black hair , sideburns , a roving wet eye , brilliant yellow boots , an incongruousdark cloth suit such as a businessman might wear in the North . His Stetson was smooth and pale and fine . " Hi , Fidel ! " yelled Jett . " Hi , Coyote ! " The man bared his teeth and spat on the ground . Then he saw Leslie , he stared and wet his lips and his great hat came off as he bent in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though to come toward them but Jett stepped on the accelerator , they darted forward , Jett laughed a high sardonic laugh of triumph . " He seen you , he knew who you was , all right . " " What of it ? " " Nothing . "  | " What did you call him ? Coyote ? Is that his name ? How queer . " " Ha , that 's good  --  coyote a name ! They call him Coyote , his name is Fidel Gomez , he runs the Mexicans he 's the richest man in town . He 's got a nice house  --  I 'll show it to you  --  no ' dobe stuff but concrete whitewashed and a tree in front and a bathroom and a dining-room set and a bedroom set and a parlor set and a Chevy and he married the swellest-looking Mexican girl in town , she was brought up real strict , she ca n't speak a word of English , he keeps her dumb all right . Everybody in the county knows Gomez . He makes out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced back . The man was still standing there gazing after them . " I want you to turn around , " she said . " I want to speak to him . " " Say , you ca n't do that . " " Turn around , boy . " " Bick 'd give me hell if he found out . I ai n't going to turn . " Suddenly she was trembling with anger . " You 'll do as I say . You 'll take me back to where that man is standing . Do n't you dare to tell me what I can or ca n't do ! " He looked at her , a sidewise almost comical look of surprise . " Okay . Esta bien . " He spun the wheel , he turned with a shrieking of rubber on shell and brought up before the man at the edge of the dusty footpath . Astonishment was plain on the titan 's face , his eyes his mouth were ovals of apprehension . " How do you do , Mr. Gomez , " said Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find absurd . " I am Mrs. Jordan Benedict . " Again the man 's hat was swept off with a gesture that belonged to another century . He bowed elaborately from the waist . " La senora es muy simpatica . " " I am sorry . I do n't speak Spanish . " A gesture of his hand made nothing of this . " You need no language . Ma'am . " The dark eyes rolled . " I say you are very charming.  --  Well , perhaps Jett Rink had been right , after all . " Uh  --  Ip222I 'm told you are a very important citizen here in Nopal . I am just having a look at your interesting little town . " His glance at Jett Rink was pure venom . His mouth was smiling. " . . . muy bondadosa , " he murmured . . " I will tell my husband we met . " She sounded , she thought , like an exercise in a child 's copybook . " Good-bye . " Again the business with the hat . The bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them as they drove off . " But why do they call him Coyote ? " She had to know . " That 's a name for hombres like him , it 's a name the Mexicans call a chiseler , a crook . He lives off of them he sneaks them across the border from Mexico to work as pickers and then when they 're here time he 's through with them they do n't have nothing left when they get through working in the Valley crops . And he rounds up the Mexican voters and does a lot of dirty jobs . " " I ca n't listen to talk like that . " " There you go again . You ask me , and then when I tell you you get sore . " Primly she said only , " It 's getting rather late . Drive me home now , please  --  but not as fast as you drove here . " Suddenly she was tired with an overpowering weariness . " What 's the hurry ? " She did not reply . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't whup you when you get back , will she ? " As she still disdained to answer , " We 're only about fifteen minutes from Benedict , you said you wanted to walk around there and there 's something there I wanted to show you , you 'll be mighty interested . " " Some other time . " He rounds up the voters and does a lot of dirty jobs . In silence they drove into the town of Benedict . She wondered now why she had found it so fascinating that day of her arrival . Three days ago . Perhaps now it seemed commonplace in contrast with the old-world town she had just glimpsed . She saw it now as a neat enough little Southwest town squatting there in the sun and dust of a late spring afternoon ; living in its little heat-bakedp223houses and selling its groceries over its decent counters and handingits tidily stacked bills out of the bank teller 's window . Drinkingits soda pop and Coca-Cola and eating its chili and enchiladasat the lunch counter and riding in its Ford . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and walk , like you said ? " " No . " " Nothing to see in Benedict . Viento , that 's different , that 's a town . Or Hermoso . You ever been to Hermoso ? " " No . " " Corpus Christi ? " " No . " " Houston ? They got stores there bigger than New York . " Bigger . Biggest ranch . Biggest steer . Biggest houses . Biggest hat . Biggest state . A mania for bigness . What littleness did it hide ? Her eyes were lacklustre as she now surveyed the main street and the side streets that ended in the open prairie . There were neat street signs here and she saw that the names had been nostalgically bestowed by people who long ago had crossed the endless plains all the weary way from the green moist Atlantic seaboard , from the woods and streams and fields of the Middle West . Ohio Street . Connecticut Avenue . Indiana Street . Iowa Street . Somewherein their background , far back among the family photographs , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wagon wheels on snow , the crack of clapboards in sudden frost , rocking chairs on shady front porches , ancient wine glass elms dappling August streets . Now they still lived like Northerners with the blood of the North in their veins . They lived against the climate in unconsciousdefiance of this tropical land . They built their houses with front porches on which they never could sit , with front yards forever grassless , they planted Northern trees that perished under the sun and drought , they planted lilacs and peonies and larkspur and roses and stock and lilies-of-the-valley and these died at birth . Arrogantly , in defiance of their Mexican compatriots , they wore Northern clothes , these good solid citizens , the men sweating inp224good cloth pants and coats , the women corseted , high-heeled , marcelled , hatted . We 're the white Americans , we 're the big men , we eat the beef and drink the bourbon , we do n't take siestas , we do n't feel the sun , the heat or the cold , the wind or the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and stayed awake while the Mexican Americans quietly rested in the shade , their hats pulled down over their eyes ; and the Negroes vanished from the streets . So the big men strode the streets , red of face , shirt-sleeved , determined . Their kind had sprung from the Iowa fanns , the barren New England fields , from Tennessee . Their ancestors had found the land too big , too lonely , it had filled them with a namelessfear and a sense of apartness , so they set out to conquer it and the people whose land it was . And these , too , they must overcomeand keep conquered , they were a constant menace , they kept surging back to it . All right , let them work for us , let them work for a quarter a day till the work is done , then kick them back across the border where they belong . " Hiya , Murch ! " " Howdy , Dub ! " So there it was , the neat little town , squatting in the sun and dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Leslie Lynnton , with the romantic and terrible and gallant and bloody pages of a score of Texas history books fresh in her mind , thought of its violent past ; it marched before her eyes . The Spanish conquistadores in their plumes and coats of mail marchingthrough this wilderness . The savage Karankawa Indians . Coronado , seeking the fabulous Gran Quivira . Sieur de La Salle in the tiny ship Amiable wrecked in Matagorda Bay . Fort St. Louis on Garcitas Creek , a rude stockade with six little huts clusteredabout it . The Jesuit priests ; the Spanish Missions , with their brown-robed sandaled monks living their orderly routine in this desert wilderness , and the bells in the chapel towers ringing across a thousand miles of nothing . . . Moses Austin , the middle-aged St. Louis banker who , by trying to establish three hundred Americanfamilies in the Texas wilderness , thought to retrieve his for/tune lost in the panic of 1819 . . . Stephen Austin , his son , the calm , the dignified , the elegant , and what was he doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dead father 's gigantic problem . . . . Sam Houston , the mysterious swashbucklinghero of a thousand tales . . . Santa Anna the glib and tough and crooked little Mexican general . . . Bowie the lionhearted . . . Travis the war-minded . . . Davy Crockett the great fellow from Tennessee . . . the magnificent hopeless defenseof the Alamo . . . Texas the Spanish . . . Texas the French . . . Texas the Mexican . . . Texas the Republic . . . Texas the Confederate . . . Texas the Commonwealth of the United States of America . . . Commonwealth . . . common wealth . . . " Say , I bet you 'd like to see what Ildefonso 's making for you in there . " She stared at Jett . " What ? What did you say ? " " That there 's Ildefonso 's place , he makes leather stuff for Reata  --  boots and saddles and straps and every kind of leather on the place , he gets fifty dollars for a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of his real tooled saddles and that 's what he doing for you . Want to see it ? Looka these boots I got on , I saved up ten months for them . " The smell of leather , rich and oily , came to you even before you entered the shop of Ildefonso Mezo . And there in the front of the shop was the ancient Mexican saddle tooled over all in an intricate pattern of flowers and serpents , the classic scrolls and leaves and patterns of ancient Spain and Mexico . Not an inch of it that was not embossed or embroidered , and stirrups pommel bridle reins shining with silver engraved in a hundred designs . Jett Rink swaggered in , there was no one to be seen , he walked behind the glass case that held the boots of every size and degree of ornamentation  --  boots for a child of three , boots for a six-foot man , stitched and scrolled , high-heeled , pointed of toe . A whirringand a tapping and a clinking came from the long dim back room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to see her new ridin ' riggin ' . "  |p226And  here was Ildefonso Mezo , as much an artist of the leather of the Southwest as Cellini had been master of the silver-worker 's craft in Italy . A little brown-faced man with bright black eyes and grizzled hair , and hands that might have been made of the leather which he artificed . Standing before Leslie , the man bowed with the utmost formality . " Buenas tardes , senora . Entre . Ildefonso Mezo at your orders . I am honored . " What could she do , what could she say ? " Gracias  --  uhmuchasgracias . " Then she laughed a little helplessly and Ildefonso laughed to keep her company and because he thought she was not so badlookingand because she was Senora Benedict . " Show us the saddle , " yelled Jett Rink . " And the boots and the belt and the whole outfit . " " It is still in the work . I must ask Senora Benedict to come to the workshop . " Leslie , standing before the sumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefinger , feeling the great weight of the leather encrusted with embossed silver . It seemed enough to weigh down a stalwart horse to say nothing of his burden of rider and accoutrements . " But this one first tell me about this one . Did they actuallyuse this ! " " How else ! " Ildefonso assured her . He was plainly enchanted by her interest . " I could show the senora silver horseshoes that were used , silver was nothing it was everywhere . The Spaniards came to Mexico and they found silver in the mines and they coveredeverything with silver  --  their clothes and their furnishings and their saddles and harnesses . Until the Spaniards came there were no horses in Mexico but soon the Mexicans became the most daring riders more daring even than the Spaniards . And so theystill are . " " Come on ! Come on ! " bawled Jett . " Okay , the Mexicans are big shots , show us that saddle you 're cutting will you ! " Still smiling , but not mirthfully , Ildefonso shook his head.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He led the way to the workroomdoorway , he stood aside then so that Leslie should enter before him . Jett Rink swaggered after him . And now Ildefonso was the artist in his studio . Along the wall beneath the windows were the worktables and the dark heads were bent over these and the keen little tools made delicate intricate marks on leather yellowand brown and cream and tan and black . Wooden horses held saddles in every state of construction and ornamentation . Leather straps and belts hung in rows like curtains , there were boots in the making , reatas , hatbands , bridles , every manner of leather thing needed on the vast ranch . Ildefonso led the way to his own worktable . And there were Leslie 's saddle and her boots and her belt and her reata and her Bridle and her hatband together with straps and thongs and coils of leather whose use she did not even know . " Weeks ! " Ildefonso assured her earnestly . " Weeks ago they were commanded . But work such as this needs many weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Virginia weeks ago the senora 's shoes was sent to me . You did not know . " So that was where the old brown boots had got to . Leslie looked at all this artfully tooled trousseau of leather , stamped and patternedso intricately by hand with the coils and twists of the Benedictbrand . And between these twisted coils were her initials her new initials squirming over everything : L L B. She looked at the heavy ornate saddle and she loathed it . In a museum , yes . Beautifulto look at . But to use ? No . She liked all things neat and reticent . A well-made English saddle , so clean-cut and economicalin its lines , had always seemed to her as lovely as a sonnet . She thought how shocked her sister Leigh Karfrey would be if ever she saw this ; and Lacey , who looked upon a horse and a saddle as other girls regard a jewel of exquisite depth and cut . And My Mistake , that fleet and lovely lady , she must never be forced to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her , triumph in his eyes . Waiting . Leslie overdid it . " It 's it 's wonderful . It 's magnificent . I 've never seen anything like it . " She decided to think of all the poly/syllabic adjectives she knew and add an 0 at the end of them . " Magnifico ! Uh marvelouso ! Extraordinario ! " Ildefonso , under extreme emotion , then gratefully expressed himself in Spanish . " What you say is true , senora . This is no commonwork of art this is art of the highest kind in leather , in all of Texas there is no one who can do this work to equal Ildefonso . " She understood not a word but his meaning was unmistakable . She found herself falling into his own pattern of stilted English . " Si , " she agreed genially . " Si si si . I shall go home now and thank my husband for all this . He told me nothing about it . " A look of horror transformed Ildefonso 's beaming face . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know if he did not tell you ? I thought when you came in " She looked at Jett Rink . Under her accusing gaze and Ildefonso 's Jett 's expression was one of utterly unconvincing innocence . " He do n't tell me what he 's doing , does he ! Anybody can come into this here shop , ca n't they , and look around ! " Abruptly Leslie turned away . " Thank you for letting me see the beautiful saddle , Ildefonso , and all the other  --  I must go now , I am very late . " Ildefonso bowed , his expression his manner were correct . But as she turned he managed to catch Jett 's sleeve for just a second and his swarthy face was close to the ruddy hard-featured one . A whisper only . " Cochino . Piojo ! " " Spilt , " said Jett Rink briefly . And clattered out to the car on those high-heeled boots for which he had paid fifty dollars . Leslie was already seated in the car , she was rather bored now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose I 've done something again that I should n't have . But what ? Sight-seeing , driven by a kind of oafish hired man . What 's wrong with that ! " Look , " he began truculently , " I did n't know he was buying them like a surprise for you , how would I " It does n't concern you at all , " Leslie said in her best Lynnton manner . " I am rather tired . It has been a long day . Thank youp229for showing me the little Mexican town . I would like to sit quietly now , and not talk . " Across the little town then , past the mournful steer in his glass case , out to where Reata could be seen hazily like a mirage shimmering in the heat against the flat Texan plain and the searing ' I'exas sky . I just drove around with this boy  --  around and around  --  because I did n't want to go back to the house . And to Luz . I did n't want to go back to my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home even when you 're as tired and hot and thirsty and stiff as I am . You ca n't go on behaving like this , you know , Leslie my girl , she told herself. " . . . girl like you before . " Jett Rink was saying something . She had n't quite heard . He seemed to be driving very slowly , for him . " What ? What did you say ? " The knuckles of his hands on the wheel showed white . " I says  --  " He cleared his throat . "  --  I says I never seen a girl  --  a woman  --  like you before . You sure are different . " She was rigid with resentment . Then she relaxed . Now do n't be silly , this is an ignorant ranch hand , poor kid he 's never been taught anything , he 's never known anything but poverty . So now she laughed a prim little artificial laugh and said , " Yes , the East and the West are different here in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He faced straight ahead . " I ai n't talking about no United States geography . I 'm talking about you . I never seen a girl like you . You ai n't afraid of nothing . I 've seen a lot of women . I been going with Cora Dart  --  the teacher  --  since she give up hoping she could hook Bick . She 's got education and all , but I never seen anybody like you , that 's for sure . " They were nearing the gates now . She 'd never need to be with him again . " Well , that 's a very nice compliment , Jett . I 'll tell my husband you said so . " Boldly , deliberately , he turned to face her . " No you wo n't , " he jibed.  |p230She  turned her head away in disgust . How could Jordan have dreamed of letting her go about with this dirty little boy . If Jordan did n't know someone should tell him . She would . There was quite a cluster of cars parked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet learned to distinguish the Reata cars from others . Horses , too . She wished that one of these could be Jordan 's and that he might be home to greet her . But that was impossible . Still , it was after five , surprisingly enough . Late , really . She had been up and about twelve hours . Tired . She opened the car door , stepped out without a word or a backward glance . Slowly she ascended the steps . This was the first time she had walked alone up these imposing front steps . She enjoyed it , it gave her a sense of belonging . She glanced about her with a spacious feeling . She was after all coming home ; tired and hot , she was coming home . Now she noticed a glass-doored gun cabinet just inside the doorway , vaguely she recalled having seen it before out of the tail of her eye and having perhaps subconsciouslydismissed it as improbable . But there it was , a neat row of guns hanging handily behind the glass doors of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was outside the case , leaning negligently against a panel . This somehow annoyed her . Guns . Whoever heard of a woman having to enter her house past a row of guns ! These were n't Indian days  --  pioneer scalping days . Do n't forget to ask Jordan . Anyway , it was a relief to be back after the long difficult day . A bath and a change . And after all , guns in the hall are kind of romantic . They 're probably the Texas version of front hall clutter , like our tennis racquets and golf clubs and fishing rods back home . Quite a hubbub of voices from the big room . Jordan 's voice . " Yoo-hoo ! " she called and felt a great surge of happiness . He was there , he would be waiting for her . Bick came swiftly toward her across the great hall , the light from the doorway was on him , she thought , Why , he looks sort of strange and wild . " Where the hell have you been ! "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell did you get to ! " " Why , darling , you look all hot and haggard . Is anything wrong ? " Now it was he who repeated . " Wrong ! " he yelled . " I had a lovely time seeing Texas , we went to Nopal , it 's unbelievable , is n't it , it 's like a foreign village But he was shouting again . " Nopal ! Nopal ! That locoed drunken bum took you to Nopal ! Leslie , Leslie ! " " But it 's all right , Jordan . What 's so terrible about that ! " There in the big living-room doorway she saw Vashti Snyth and Cora Dart , they became part of a confused and bewildering picture . " Why hello ! How nice to see you , " she began , very socially , and moved toward them . Over her shoulder she added , in the direction of the purpling Bick , " It was your idea to have him call for me . " She was embarrassed , she was angry , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Her code condemned family exhibitions of temper . She went smiling to the two women in the doorway , she took Vashti 's hand in greeting , she had to pick up the limp and unresponsive hand of the schoolteacher but she managed it well enough . " D' you know , there 's really more protocolin Texas than there is in Washington  --  or at the Court of St. James 's for that matter . But I 'll learn . " She thought they were looking at her too strangely . " How nice to find you here . Uh , Miss Dart , I 've had a wonderful idea ; could you give me Spanish lessons  --  out of your school hours I mean  --  if you could Then she saw Luz . She was lying on the big couch in a curious stuffed-doll fashion , her mouth was open , her eyes were shut and her breathing was a snore , but more horrible than a snore . Leslie turned her head then to stare at the two women watchingher so intently . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bick came up behind her , his face was a curious grey beneath the russet now , and rigid . " It 's our fault . She wanted to go withp232us . My Mistake . She can ride anything . The Western saddle  --  the horse stepped in a gopher hole , deep . " " What is it ? " " Concussion . Or worse . Fracture , maybe . " " Doctor Tom . Doctor Tom Walker . " " He 's here . He 's telephoning . " " Hospital in Benedict . " " There is no hospital in Benedict . " " That other  --  that Viento place . " " No hospital in Viento . " Cora Dart spoke for the first time . " She 's dying . " As though she found satisfaction in saying it she repeated it . " Dying . " Hurriedly then Vashti became conversational . " He broke his leg , the horse . When he stumbled and threw her . Luz 's head came up against a mesquite stump . They had to shoot him . Bick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Mistake will never have to wear that silly saddle . That will teach you not to ride in hoop skirts , Luz Benedict . " Look out ! " yelled Vashti Snyth . " She 's going to faint again . Bick ! " With a tremendous effort of will Leslie Benedict pulled the swirling world into steadiness . " Oh , no I 'm not , " she said . " I 'm never going to faint again . " 23215EVERYBODY CAME to the funeral . Fortunately the actual basic Benedict family was small . A closed corporation . But Texas converged from every point of the compass . Friends , enemies , employees , business connections ; ranchers , governors , vaqueros , merchants , senators , cowboys , millionaires , politicians , housewives . The President of the United States sent a message of condolence . There had been no such Texas funeral since the death of Jordan Benedict Second . Luz Benedict had become a legendary figure though no one actually knew her in her deepest darkest depths except , oddlyp234enough , outsiders such as Jett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Tom Walker . Bick Benedict , her baby brother , knew her least of all ; or if he knew , refused to face the knowledge . Bick Benedict , whom she had deviled and ruled and loved , whose life she had twisted and so nearly ruined ; toward whom she had behaved like an adoring and possessive mother wife sister combined in one frustrated human being . The world of Texas knew her as the Benedict family matriarch . Sometimesthey wondered why a patriarch , in the person of Uncle Bawley Benedict , ruler of the vast Holgado Division , and older than his niece by fifteen years , did not head the clan . To this the wise ones made answer . " Bawley ! Why , say , he would n't have it a gift . That of Bawley , he 's a maverick . If he had his druthers he would n't see a Benedict one year 's end to the next . He 's smarter than any of ' em ; than Bick , even . If he put his mind to it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log . But he sets back like he 's done for years , smiling and hushed , and lets Bick run Reata and Luz run Bick . " Everybody who was anybody in Texas came to the funeral . They came , not to mourn the violent exit of Miss Luz Benedict , spinster , aged fifty , but to pay tribute to a Texas institution known as the Benedicts of Reata Ranch . Almost a century of Texas was contained in the small and resentful arrangement of human clay now so strangely passive in the bronze and silver box . Mortuary artifice had been powerless to erase entirely the furiousfrown that furrowed her brow . The lips were unresigned , the jaw pugnacious . Luz Benedict , tricked by sly and sudden death , could almost be said to bristle in her coffin . You , Death ! You ca n't do this to me ! This is Luz Benedict of Reata , this is my house this is my ranch this is my Texas this is my world . Familiar faces , bent over her for a last good-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was depicted there , arrogance , and the Benedict will to rule and triumph . You ca n't do this to me , I do as I please , all the Benedicts do as they please , I am a Benedict of Reata I am Texas.  |p235Every  bedroom in the Big House was filled , guests were sleeping in the bookless library , in the mute music room . Even the old unused adobe Main House of family tradition the house in which Bick Benedict and the Benedicts before him had been born  --  was opened now and aired and made habitable for the funeral guests who swarmed from every corner of the vast commonwealthand from most of the forty-seven other comparatively negligible states of the United States of America . Privately the family thought how like Luz to inconvenience everyone in the Benedict world and to make them do her bidding against their own plans and inclinations . Here it was late spring and Maudie Lou Placer and her polo-playing husband had been just about to sail for a summer in England and Scotland and France . Roady Benedict had secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas interests and was gamefishingin the luxurious wilds of the Benedict Canadian camp . Mr. and Mrs. Bowie Benedict were knee-deep in the blue grass of their Kentucky racing stables . Uncle Bawley was , as always , a lone eagle in his eyrie at the Holgado Division spread amongst the mountains of the Trans-Pecos . Assorted cousins of the first second and third degree were snatched from their oysters Rockefeller at Antoine 's in New Orleans , from their suites at the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco , from their tennis in Long Island , from the golf links of White Sulphur , and summoned to pay last homage to their kinswoman . Leslie moved from group to group , from room to room , from crowd to crowd . Sometimes she did not try to identify herself , sometimes she said , " I am Mrs. Benedict . " " Which Mrs. Benedict ? " " Jordan . Mrs. Jordan Benedict . " Mystified for a moment , they would stare . Then , " Oh , Bick ! Bick 's wife . Well , say ! I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live near here ? " " Milt K. Masters . " " Oh . Yes . I just wondered if you lived near Reata , Mr. Masters . "  | " Mr. Masters ! Say , that 's a good one . My name ai n't Masters . My name 's Decker  --  Vern Decker . " " I thought you said " That 's the name of the town I live in , town of Milt K. Masters . Named after the fella started it . " But she had no time then to ponder on what manner of man this Milt K. Masters had been to wish to perpetuate himself by stamping his undistinguished name on a little Texas town . " How interesting . Of course . Named after a man . Like Houston or Kingsville or  --  or Benedict , for that matter . " " Well , now , it 's just a little cow town but we think it 's just about the best little town in the whole state of Texas . Quite a piece from here , four five hundred miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How come you ai n't been , you and Bick ? I take it real unfriendly . " " I 've only been a few days in Texas . " A few days . It was with a feeling of unbelief that she heard herselfsaying this . A few days since she had stepped off the train at Vientecito . " Well , ma'am , you sure got a treat coming to you . You 're going to get acquainted with the greatest state in the country . Yes ma'am , and I do n't mean only size . I mean greatest everything . Crops . Cotton . Cattle . Horses . Folks . " " Do excuse me a moment , wo n't you ? I think my husband is beckoning to me . He 's just over there . " " Sure . Run right along . Say , it 's pretty lucky Bick 's got you now , keep him from being low-spirited . He 's sure going to feel Miss Luz being gone . She was more like a mother to Bick than a sister . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy . Her father had offered to come to her , as she knew he would . Do you want us to come , his telegram had said , Mother and I can start immediately . Do n't come , she had replied . It 's such a journey the funeral is day after tomorrow I am well Jordan is well enough but terribly shocked how strange and terrible that it should have been My Mistake.  |p237Her  husband was a stranger whom she could not reach . She was someone living in his house . It seemed to her that there was no cousin so remote but he or she yet seemed closer to Jordan Benedict than his wife . He was sodden with grief and remorse . In his stunned mind was a confusion in which Luz and Leslie and My Mistake and the morning of the roundup and his years of deep and hidden resentment against this dominating woman were inextricably blended . Leslie tried to comfort him with her arms about him , with her intelligence , with her sympathy her love her understanding of this emotional shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundredth time . " She just wanted to ride out to the roundup with us , " he would say . " Why did n't she ? Why did n't she come with us ? " He wanted her to say it . " We wanted to be alone . And that was right . " " If I had n't bought My Mistake she 'd be alive today . " Leslie decided on stern measures . " Yes , if you had n't bought My Mistake your sister Luz would be alive today . And if Papa had n't cured the ulcers of the horse 's original owner he would n't have wanted to show his gratitude by giving Papa the horse . And if Wind Wings had n't wandered into the wrong paddock , My Mistake never would have been born . If you want me to go on with this , if Papa had n't been a surgeon , and if he had n't married Mama and if I had n't been their daughter  --  well , you can go back as far as you like , Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was shocked , she was in a way frightened , when she learned that by Jordan 's orders Luz Benedict 's saddle , her boots , her Stetson , her riding clothes and even the tragic hoop skirts of family tradition were to be left untouched in her bedroom as a shrine . How he must have hated her , Leslie thought . Guilt is an awful thing , it can destroy him , I wo n't let it . So she went from group to group , from room to room , always with an eye on Bick . To anyone who had known her in the past it would have been amazing to see how she took charge of thisp238vast household . The obsequies had assumed the proportions of a grim public ceremonial . " We can put up another bed in this little sewing room . They can use the bath across the hall . . . . I know he will want to see you , he is resting just now he had no sleep last night . . . . A cake ! How good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so busy in the kitchen . . . . You are Jordan 's cousin Zora ? Of course of course he often speaks of . . . " The Girls were wonderful ; and of the Girls Vashti Snyth and Adarene Morey were twin towers of strength and efficiency . They knew their Texas , they knew their Benedicts , they were the daughters and granddaughters and great-granddaughters of men and women who had wrestled and coped with every native manifestation from drought and rattlesnakes to Neiman-Marcus and bridge . " I 'll do it , Leslie . Just you sit down . " " I do n't want to sit down . I ca n't . " " I know it . I do n't mean really sit down . I mean let me do this and you make out like you 're listening to all these people keep bawling at you , it 'll take all the strength you got . " This from the salty Vashti . Adarene and Lucius Morey had arrived the day after Luz 's death . They must have driven at ninety miles an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They entered the Big House , they took over . Servants . Food . Telegrams . Telephones . In a bedlam of big boots and big hats and big men and a cacophony of voices male and female these two seemed pure peace  --  Lucius Morey of the neat dark un-Texan suit and the neat dark un-Texan shoes and the shrewd blue eyes in the bland banker 's face ; Adarene of the plain countenance and the knobby forehead and the correct clothes and the direct gaze and the debunked mind . The crowds streamed up the steps of the great front entrance , solemnly they Viewed the Remains , they swarmed in the dining room , the grounds , the drive , the outer road , the town of Benedict , the roads for miles around were alive with them . Arcadio at the gatehouse entrance could not limp fast enough to encompassp239the steady stream of visitors flowing through his portals . Three Mexican helpers were delegated as assistants . Besieged though they were , no one passed the gates who was not known to one or all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coyote of Nopal to the Governor with his aides , come all the way from Austin . Bick met them all , his bloodshot eyes mutely questioning each mournful face as though hoping to find there the comforting answer to his self-reproach . . . Well say , Bick , I sure was throwed when I heard the news . . . . As representative of the Great Commonwealth of Texas I wish to extend in the name of my fellow citizens . . . " . . Mi estimado amigo , lo siento mucho . . . " Leslie , with a scant week of Texas experience to guide her , moved among the mourners trying hard to remember Texas names , Texas faces , Texas customs . The Placers , that was easy ; and Bowie and his wife and Roady and his wife and even a niece or two and a couple of nephews . But the others , millions of others . Let me remember . . . Uh , Mrs. Jennings . . . SomebodyBeezer . . . Ila Something Motten . . Mrs. Jakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panacea for grief . She kept plucking at Bick 's sleeve , she grasped Leslie 's arm , she motioned in the direction of the dining room from which came a sustained clatter accompanied by rich and heavy scents . " You got to eat if you 're going to keep your strength up . How you going to expect to go through tomorrow if you do n't eat ! Leslie , Bick looks terrible . Bick , Leslie looks real ganted . Pa tried to get over and could n't . He 'll be next , mark my words . He 's down sick , I ought to be there right now looking after him , he do n't even beller at Mott any more , just lays there so pitiful , course he ai n't been real rugged for a year and more , yesterday he said to me , Vashti , he said , it wo n't be long now , and when it comes you promise to put me away like I want to be put , no tie and my leather brush jacket . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youp240look real peaked . Leslie , come on have a cup of coffee and a cake . " Adarene Morey came close to Leslie , her voice low in the midst of the clamor . " Relax . Bick 's all right . It 's good for him to have all these people around . Do n't work so hard . Let them do the work . They 're curious about you , you know . Even more than they are about seeing Luz , and how Bick behaves . " " Why ? " " The Queen is dead . Long live the Queen ! If she can take it . " " I can take it . " There was a stir at the doorway , there was an acceleration of sound . " What 's that ? Who 's that ? " Uncle Bawley 's arrival was something of an event . Uncle Bawley who kinged it alone in splendid squalor at the Holgado Division , Uncle Bawley who had ignored Bick 's wedding except for the sending of a monolithic silver edifice that resembled a cenotaph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and even Mrs. Lynnton  --  never had been able to fathom . Now , as he strode through the welter of relatives , guests , neighborsand officials , Leslie was shocked . His eyes were streaming with tears , they washed down his cheeks and dropped off his chin . This was all the more startling because Uncle Bawley towered even above these Texas men who seemed to fill the rooms to bursting with their great shoulders , their pyramidal necks , their leather-colored faces , their leather-colored clothes , their enormous hats , their high-heeled boots , their overpowering maleness . Yet there was about this gigantic man a grace , an air of elegance . He was wearing a dark suit and black boots and Leslie 's knowing eye was quick to see that these garments had been born of the needle and shears of a New York tailor or even perhaps of a London magician of men 's clothes . They almost hid the slight bulge that , at nearly seventy , was just beginning to mar his waistline . Leslie felt she could not bear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faded blue , and the lids crinkled so that lines , etched by the sun and the wind , radiated from themp241fanwise at the temples . She knew he had been a Ranger in his youth , with gun notches and all the rest of the fabulous fanfare that went with stories of pioneer Texas times . Even now , in spite of his city suit , he was startlingly like a figure in the romantic fables of the region . He came across the room , threading his way toward Bick , making slow progress because of the outstretched hands and the spoken greetings , muted but hearty with affection . She knew that he had arrived and that he had refused to stay at the Big House or at the old Main House . He was quartered in one of the nearby line houses . Later , when she knew him better , she had remonstratedat his uncomfortable quarters . " You should be staying here , in the Big House . " " Me here ! Like to choke to death living in this pile . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture from Bick he turned to face Leslie . His eyes narrowed , then widened . There was no escaping him , his gaze was upon her and now as he came toward her Leslie was dismayed to see that he mopped his eyes with his handkerchief and she marveled that his features were so composed under this fountain of tears . He stood beside her , he took her hand in his and looked down at her from his towering height . Inadequately Leslie murmured , " I know what she must have meant to you  --  your eldest niece . I am so terribly sorry for you and for Jordan and for He dabbed at his eyes with his free hand . " Do n't pay this no mind , " he said , and his voice was gentle and low and almost caressing . " I ai n't bawling . This is what they call an allergy . Took me better than forty years to find out about it . " " Allergy ! " she repeated after him , stunned . " That 's right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarts . " She smiled wanly and dutifully , scenting one of these regional jokes she did not understand . She played up to it . " Tell me the rest . "  | " The smart new doctors found it out after I 'd been snuffling and bawling around for forty years and better . All my life a cowmanand the whole Benedict family first and last for a hundred years or nearly . And then a kid at Johns Hopkins finds out I 'm allergic to cows . " Leslie was utterly fascinated . She forgot about Luz and mourningetiquette and bereaved relatives-by-marriage . Temporarily she even forgot about Jordan . With a hand tucked in Uncle Bawley 's arm she maneuvered him toward a quiet corner of the vast room , away from the tight groups that seemed to prefer to stand in the center of the room , talking talking talking . A huge couch whose overstuffed arms were the size of an average chair was angled away from the room proper , by some mistaken whim of a decorator  --  or perhaps of Luz . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg crossed under her . " This is wonderful , " she said , and looked up , up at his toweringheight . " I 'm  --  well  --  I know now what my mother meant when she used to say I-haven't-sat-down-today . " " Nothing can beat you out quicker than a houseful of people come for a funeral , especially if they 're choused up like this . And you 're new to it here . Bad enough if you 're a Texian . " His shouldersrelaxed against the back of the vast couch , his long legs sprawled across the polished floor , his feet turned toes up , slim and arched in the beautifully hand-tooled high-heeled black boots . Leslie regarded him with anticipatory relish . " I must tell my father all about you . He 'll be enchanted . " " Enchanted with me ? " " He 's a doctor . " " He here ? " " No . No , he 's home . I mean he 's in Virginia where we  --  where he lives . He 'll be so interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The allergy , I mean . And about you . Do you mind if I call you Uncle Bawley  --  though I must say it does n't suit you . " " I 'd just purely love for you to do that . Leslie ? I do n't know as that suits you either . Usual thing I go slow with Yankees using their given names . They 're touchy . "  | " That 's funny . I think Texans are touchy . " " They 're just vain , " Uncle Bawley said in his soft almost musing voice . " Vain as peacocks and always making out like they 're modest . Acting all the time , most of them . Playing Texas . " She stared at him , fascinated , she broke into a laugh , then checked herself , horrified . She inched her way across the hummocksof the couch so that she sat now just beside him and facing him , her back to the room . " How refreshing you are ! I hope you do n't mind my saying that , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Why did n't you come to our wedding ? " " I never go to weddings . Waste of time . Person can get married a dozen times . Lots of folks do . Family like ours , know everybody in the state of Texas and around outside , why , you could spend your life going to weddings , white and Mexican . But a funeral , that 's different . You only die once . " She lied politely . " You sent us a magnificent wedding present , even though you did n't come . " " Was it ? I never did rightly know what they sent . I just wrote to Tiffany 's and I said for them to send a silver piece looked like a wedding present ought to look . " " They did , " Leslie murmured , wondering when the packing boxes containing all those wedding gifts would arrive from Virginia , and where she could possibly place Uncle Bawley 's cenotapheven in this gargantuan house with its outsize rooms . Mischievouslyshe decided to try a Texasism . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original fascinating subject . " You must find it very trying  --  the allergy I mean . In your  --  uh -- business . " " It 's mean as all hell , pardon me , but up in the high country where I live , mountainous and the air clear , why sometimes I hardly notice it . It all but stops except for a few weeks maybe in the hot of summer if we do n't get the seasonal rains we should . Down here , though , in the brush , the minute I set foot it starts like a fountain . The dust and the wind and the cow claps and the hair hides all together they set these springs to working . If the folks around here was smart they 'd pay me just to walkp244around sprinkling this brush country . Course the dust 's the worst down here . That and the wind . " " The wind , " she repeated after him . " The wind the wind . Does n't it ever stop ? Do n't tell Jordan  --  but the wind makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't pay it no mind , " he said soothingly . " Texas folks are all nervous and jumpy . Do n't appear to be , being so big and highpowered , but they are . You notice they laugh a lot ? Nervous people do , as a general rule . Easy laughers , but yet not what you 'd call real gay by nature . Up in the Panhandle they 're even jumpier than they are down here in the brush . Up there the wind blows all the time , never stops blowing , even the cattle are kind of loco up there . But where I live , in the Davis Mountains , it 's just about perfect . " He took from his coat pocket a folded handkerchief , white and fine , and as he wiped his brimming lids Leslie caught the pricking scent of eau de cologne . She sniffed the tangy scent now and beamed upon her new-found relative . This giant of the leathery skin , the gentle voice , the fine linen , the glove-fitting boots , was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp sidewise look . " Maybe you think it 's funny , a cowman getting himself all smelled up pretty . " " No , I like it . I like fastidious men . " " It 's made me a heap of trouble . First off , my real name 's Baldwin  --  Baldwin Benedict  --  that 's what they named me . Then along come this crying and that cinched it . I was Bawley Bene-dict . " " Oh , Uncle Bawley , I 'm so sorry . What would you like me to call you ? " " That 's all right , I 'm used to it . But I had to fist-fight my way through school and college . The Mexicans hereabouts call me Ilorono -- The Weepy . At Harvard I was fullback and heavyweightboxer just in self-defense . I was a heavier build then . Puppy fat . I like to wore out my knuckles proving I was n't a sissy . I have to laugh when I think of it now . " " Harvard ? "  | " We all go a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a trip to Europe young . The girls go to some school in the East . " His tone , his diction took on a complete change . " Just to prove to the world and ourselves that we are n't provincial . " She leaned toward him . " Please do n't think I 'm rude . But you talk  --  I mean Harvard and Europe and everything  --  and just now you  --  but most of the time you talk  --  well , the only ones who do n't are Jordan , and Maudie Lou . And now you  --  when you were n't looking . " " I know . Sometimes we forget to talk Texas . " " But Uncle Bawley , it 's regional , is n't it ? A kind of dialect just as the Boston people speak one way and the deep South another and the Middle Westerners another . " He had not mopped his eyes for a full five minutes , the tears had ceased to flow . " Partly . That 's right . Down here it 's a mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks from all over the whole country . It settled into a kind of jargon , but we play it up . Like when I was a young squirt visiting New York there was a girl named Anna Held a French actress . She was all the rage , milk baths and pearls and so on , by that time she could speak English as good as you and me , but there she was a-zissin ' and a-zattin ' because it was good publicity and cute . That 's us . Mostly , we know better . But we talk Texas because it 's good publicity and cute . " " Uncle Bawley , " she said earnestly , " I love talking to you . " He blushed like a girl . " That 's funny . " " Why ? " ? " I hardly ever talk to a woman . I got out of the habit . No women up to the Holgado Division , hardly , except two three of the section bosses live in the line houses with their wives and kids . But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use vaqueros up there , too near to the border . Course there 's all the Mexican families in Montaraz , that 's the town just outside the ranch . " The town outside the ranch . She smiled . " What you smiling at ? " he demanded . " What 'd I say made you smile like that and kind of shake your head ? "  | " I just thought how very Texan . The town outside the ranch . Most people would say , the ranch outside the town , would n't they ? " " Maybe so . If it was n't for Holgado there would n't be any town . Handful of Mexicans , maybe . " She hesitated a moment , but only a moment . The habit of wanting to know was too strong . " But did n't you ever marry ? Why ? " " What girl would have a man who stands there bawling with tears running down his face while he 's asking her to marry t him ! " Leslie was staring at him , she was scurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her years with her father had taught her to do . " Cows ! " " How 's that ? " " Allergic to cows . " " That 's right . " She was looking into his face with the most utter concentration . " Uncle Bawley , did you want to be a cowman ? Did you want to be head of Holgado and a big Benedict rancher and all that ? " " Hell no , honey . " " What did you want to be ? " " Funny you should ask me that . I have n't thought about it in years . What I wanted to be was , I wanted to be a musician . Pianist . " Leslie 's head turned toward him as if it had been jerked on wires . But the big pink face was bland , almost dreamy . " There 's always been music in the family , one way or another , but the minute it shows its head it gets stepped on . " " Uncle Bawley , do you mean you wanted the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know 's I looked at it square in the face , like that . But when I got to Europe I studied there with Levenov till they made me come home . Big rumpus , there was . The whole family . You 'd thought I wanted to run a faro wheel or marry a Mexican . Young men were younger then , I guess , than theyp247are now when they 're young . Pa got after me . Bick 's Pa too . My brother , named like Bick . Jordan . They got me out roping and branding and one thing another . Nothing spoils your hands quicker than that . For piano , I mean . Time they got through with me I was lucky if I could play chopsticks . About that time Brahms was just beginning to catch on , I was crazy about his  --  well , you know , you ca n't fool around with anything like that , I sat there at the piano looking at my fingers , it was like they were tied on with wires . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ! " She was terribly afraid she was going to cry . She looked down at his great sunburned hands , splotched with the vague brown spots of the aging . He looked at her and smiled , his teeth were brownish and somewhat broken , the great round face was beginning to be a bit crumpled , he was a monumental structure he was almost three times Leslie 's age , she wanted to take his hands in hers and press her lips to them as a mother comforts a child who has been hurt . He must have sensed something of this as he looked at her . Apologeticallyhe hurried on . " How 'd we get onto that ! Well , there was Holgado to run and I was picked to run it . Now when I look back on it , it 's kind of crazy . Benedicts and big Texas ranch folks , they act like they were royalty or something . Old-fashioned stuff . " He leaned toward her . " Let me tell you something , Leslie . If your kids get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it they do it . " " I will , Uncle Bawley . I promise I will . " " You get Bick to bring you out to Holgado for a nice visit . In the spring it 's real pretty . When the Spanish dagger is out . And summers , after the seasonal rains it 's right green , places . " " Is it a success ? Does Jordan  --  do you and Jordan think it 's successful ? " " Holgado ! Why , say , it 's the money-maker of the whole outfit . Even Maudie Lou and Placer and Bowie do n't complain about its being unfinancial . Course I do n't stock all the newfangled stuff Bick goes in for here at Reata . Not that I do n't think Bick 's a smart boy . There 's nothing he do n't know about a ranch  --  hornp248hide and hair . " He smiled at her , a singularly sweet and childlike smile . " I ai n't talked this much to a woman in years . " " You 're just fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you . " From behind her shoulder came Maudie Lou Placer 's high hard voice , she was leaning a little over the back of the huge couch . " There are people coming in all the time , they are asking for you , naturally . Elly Mae and I are doing all we can , and Roady and Lira of course , but Bick is worn out and it seems to me that you and Uncle Bawley  --  well Leslie sprang up . " Oh , Maudie Lou , I am so sorry . I was n't thinking . " " Rilly ! " said Maudie Lou in her best borrowed Eastern accent . The big room was now so densely packed that just to elbow a way through it was a physical effort . Nowhere in all this vast desert could one find an oasis of peace and quiet . A clamor of talk here , a rumble of sound from the adjoining rooms and the great hall . The huge dining room was all too small . The modest twenty places habitually laid had swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of tables and there was never a gap in the places . People drifted in as though it were a restaurant , they sat and ate and left and others took their places , the food flowed out of the kitchen an avalanche borne on a flood of coffee . The air was heavy with the odors of cooking , grey with cigarette smoke . A dozen  --  twenty -- Mexicans manned the cooking and serving . Steaming plates platters bowls . Back and forth back and forth . Sientese. , senor . . . Traigame el cafe solo . . . . Crema . . . . Heh , Domingo ! Traigame otro . . . Si senor , si senora . The driveway swarmed with cars and horses , they stretched down the road and spilled over into the weed-grown space in front of the old Main House half a mile distant . There was , for the accommodation of house guests , quite a fleet of cars shuttling back and forth between the Big House and the Main House , like a bus service . It was midafternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great double doors of the parlor beyond  --  the doors so constantly opening and closing to admit the intimate hundreds to the room they called the parlor where the little angry woman lay in state . And she tried not to think of the heat and of the night and of the next day . And she wished with all her heart that the huge house and the well-meaning , hordes that swarmed within it and without it , and the hundreds who served it , would vanish into the desert distance and that she could be alone with that Jordan Benedict she had met in Virginia , away from the noise and clamor and uproar of the endless spaces of Texas . She made her way to Bick standing there near the doorway with a group of men . She slid her arm through his ; she thought , He looks ghastly it 's as if he had shrunk in his clothes . " I 've been talking to Uncle Bawley . He 's marvelous . " " Yes . Uncle Bawley 's great guy . " " Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had some coffee . " " Coffee ! You ca n't live on coffee . I have n't had anything either . Wo n't you come with me ? " Gently he took her hand from his arm , he shook his head . " One of the girls  --  Maudie Lou will go with you  --  Adarene  --  here 's Adarene , right here . " He turned back to the men . And here was Adarene . " You look kind of funny , " said Adarene . " Are you all right ? " Leslie clutched her arm . " Adarene , would they think it was queer if I just went up to rest in my own room a few minutes ? " " Of course not . " " Will you come with me ? " Guiltily they wormed their way through the crowded room , through the hall to the stairway up and down which people she never before had seen were purposefully tramping . It was like being in a museum on a free exhibition day . When she opened her own bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawled on chairs and bed ? " Here we are , " said Adarene , and turned the doorknob . The door was locked . The two women stared at each other.  | " Who ? " demanded Leslie fiercely . " Who is in there ? " She pounded on the door with her fist , her feeling of outrage was the accumulation of days . There was no sound from within . " Shall I peek through the keyhole ? " asked Adarene . " Keyhole ! My own room ! " " It 's an enormous keyhole . " " Well " Leslie faltered , and glanced apprehensively over her shoulder down the length of the long hall . There was Lupe coming swiftly and soundlessly toward them . In her hand was the cumbersome key that fitted the massive door . Her dark eyes were lively and understanding , she jerked her head meaningfully toward the swarming crowd . The key grated in the lock , she flung the door open , her eyes darted about the room as though someone might have crept through the keyhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to Leslie and made a quick motion of the hand that advised locking the door from the inside . With another jerk of the head toward the babel below she vanished , closing the door behind her . The two women sensed that she waited a moment there outside until she heard the turn of the key . " They 're the ones who 'll really mourn Luz , " Adarene said . " Did you hear them last night ? " " No . Hear what ? " " The Mexicans will have their own mourning ceremonies for her . Lew and I could hear them last night , long after midnight down in the barrios , playing the guitar and singing her favorite songs . For weeks they 'll be saying rosarios  --  evening prayers . And a lot of other mourning customs that are kind of weird , some of them . " " Because she was a Benedict ? A kind of feudal custom ? " " No , not altogether . She was hard on them but she understood them  --  the older generation anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the madrina . Of course they never called her that , but they knew . They always know . . . . Why do n't you lie down and shut your eyes , rest a while ? Maybe you can sleep . "  | " Adarene , dear good Adarene . " " Do you want Lupe to bring you a cup of tea ? " " Not now . Just to sit here away from the crowd . " Briskly Adarene said , " Anyway , it 's given you a chance to meet the State of Texas . Ordinarily it would have taken a newcomer weeks and months and years . They 're all here large and small . Old Texas and new Texas . The cotton rich and the rotten rich and the big rich . Cattle , and the new oil crowd , and wheat and the Hermoso and Houston and Dallas big business bunch . " " I wish I knew half of what you know , " Leslie said . " It would be better for Jordan . " " You were pretty vivacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did n't realize . " " You 're on exhibition . Uncle Bawley 's never been known to talk as long as that to any woman . He 's woman-shy . " " I did n't mean to be disrespectful to  --  to Luz . He was enormouslyinteresting . " " Luz was a bitch and a holy terror and kind of crazy , too . Everybody knows that . But she was Luz Benedict . Madama . " " There 's so much I do n't understand . " " You 'd have to be born here  --  around 1836 . " " Adarene , are you happy here ? " " I would n't be happy living anywhere else . I 've tried it . Texas is in my blood . I do n't rightly know what it is  --  a kind of terrific vitality and movement . " " I get the feeling that they 're playing wild West like kids in the back yard . " " Maybe . Some of the time . But it really still is the wild West  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles and Bar-B-Que shacks and new houses with Greek columns and those new skyscrapersthat my Lucius and Gabe Target and his crowd are running up . Skyscrapers out on the prairie where there 's a million miles to spread out . " Leslie walked to the window and glanced out between the jalousies and closed her eyes and came back and sat at the edgep252of the bed . She smoothed the coverlet a bit with her hand , a little aimless gesture . Then she lay back and pressed her forearm over her eyes . " I 'm kind of scared . " " No wonder . You 've had quite a week . But you 'll get used to it . It 's the ranch that 's got you scared . I do n't know why Bick keeps on living here the year round . I wo n't do it . We 're ranchers too , you know . Everybody 's got a ranch , big or little . But I wo n't live on it . It 's all different . Or maybe I am . Even the cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the Longhorns . Not many , but some . Now they 're stocking grey velvet oriental monsterswith slanting eyes and humps on their backs . Scare you . Scare anybody . " " Oh , Adarene " Leslie began . There was a smart knock at the door . A series of them with determined knuckles . Leslie sat up , she smoothed her hair . The two women exchanged glances , Adarene 's finger went to her lips . Leslie stood up . " Maybe it 's Jordan . . . . Who is it ? " Aloud . " Girls ! Girls , can I come in ? " Vashti . " Damn ! " said Adarene , under her breath ; her eyebrows went up in rueful inquiry . Leslie nodded . And there , when the great key had been turned , was Vashti bouncing in with the over-eager uncertain look of a little girl who tags along unwanted by her playmates . Round red eager she glanced from Leslie to Adarene . " I saw you go up and then when you did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the lou all this while maybe there 's something the matter is anything the matter ? " " Thank you , Vashti , " Leslie said . " Nothing 's wrong . I just felt I had to rest a minute . " Vashti threw her washed-blue eyes ceilingward in an effort at mental concentration . " Let 's see now . How long is it since you and Bick were married ? Wedding trip and all . Month , anyway  --  is n't it ? " " No , " Leslie said . " I mean , yes , it 's a month . But I 'm tired because of what 's happened , and so many people to meet . "  | " I guess , " Vashti offered then , " you 'll be glad when this is all over . " Adarene Morey took charge . " Vashti , stop talking like a dope . Do people usually like to keep a funeral going on around the house ! " Vashti moved about the room humming gently to herself which was a habit she had  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of gossip to impart . She meandered to the broad expanse of the dresser with its silver and crystal and scent and silk . She sniffed at the stopper of a fragrant flask of perfume , her head on one side like a wary plump bird , her eyes glancing corner-wise at Leslie . " I guess Jett Rink will be too , " she observed airily . " Glad . " Adarene Morey stood up . " Let 's go down now , girls . If you feel rested , Leslie . " " What has Jett Rink to do with it ? " Leslie asked , though instincttold her not to . Vashti now assumed the air of an aggrieved little girl . " Well , I just meant what they 're saying downstairs , the men and all . " " Vashti Hake ! " Adarene said in sharp warning . " Snyth , " retorted Vashti in correction . " All right . Hake or Snyth , " Adarene went on , dropping into Texas patois in her indignation , " you 've got no call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I did n't pick it up . Mott told me . " She melted in a fatuous smile . " That 's the nicest thing about being married to Mott Snyth . He knows all the talk around , first off . " " I 'll bet ! " said Adarene with vigor . " Adarene Morey , if you mean because Mott used to be a cow hand before he married me and cow hands are the talkingest men there is " No , Vashti , I did n't mean anything like that . Pinky Snyth is no worse than all the other Texas men when it comes to gossip-ing . " Leslie felt there had been enough of this . " Will you two please tell me what you 're talking about ! "  | " We-e-e-ll , " Vashti began , with dreadful relish , " they 're saying around it was Jett got Miss Luz to try riding My Mistake in the first place and it was him said he bet she could put on a hoop skirt like her grammaw and rope anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it and ride out just to show you " Ale ! " " Well , I 'm just saying what they said he said , I do n't know . So sure enough what does Luz do but go up to the attic trunks and get out that hoop skirt and a big old Western saddle with a horn like a hitching post . And the minute that horse felt that saddle and glimpsed that hoop skirt he was like possessed it took three to hold him and she hardly 'd climbed on Mott said when he was off like a bat out of hell that 's what Mott said  --  and they 're saying around that after Bick shot the horse that killed Luz , why , Gill noticed there was a kind of funny-looking spit , like , around the horse 's mouth " Gill ? " " The vet . The head vet . Gill Dace . " " Oh yes . Yes . " " So he noticed there was a funny-looking spit , like , around his mouth and so he made some tests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something hopped him up , Gill said it was enough to hop up a whole herd of drought-starved Longhorns , let alone one horse . " Adarene Morey attempted to stay the flood . " That 's just a lot of stable talk , I do n't believe a word of it , anyway Jett Rink would n't dare . " She thought Leslie looked very odd , feeling around like that for the edge of the chair behind her before sinking down on it . " He would so . He and Luz hated each other like poison and then when Cora told Luz about her and Jett , why , Luz said she 'd turn them both off the ranch , you know the way she wanted to run everybody 's business her own way and seemed she could n't bear for anyone to get married , even if they had to , like Cora , look at the way she behaved about you and Bick  |p255Leslie  stood up very tall and straight . " Thanks so much for coming up with me , it was sweet of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure , " Vashti agreed briskly . " I just came up to see if I could help . The boys are saying Bick gave Jett ten minutes to get off the ranch and they say he 's going to take that piece of land away from him he gave him that time old Rink turned ' up missing , but he ca n't do that because Jett was smart , he 's got it down on paper it 's his . They started a terrible fist fight only if Gill and those had n't pulled them apart . " Leslie was moving toward the door , she proceeded rather grandly , giving the effect of wearing a long train which definitely was not in evidence . The key turned with a great clunk . She opened the door , " Petra ! " she called above the din below . " Lupe ! " She felt very strange and light in this new world of sound and movement and violence . It 's because I 've eaten nothing I suppose , she thought . Aloud she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they ever smack you good and hard ? " " My yes . " " Not hard enough , " said Leslie . Innocently , quite unruffled , Vashti prattled on . " Even now , sick as he is , times I think Pa 'd like to slap me if he could , Pa 's always bossing everybody around , he 's always after Mott , saying Pinky do this way , Pinky do that way , just like Luz does  --  used to do . . . . It 's sure going to be nice for you , Leslie , having the run of this big house and nobody to boss you around . . . . Ooh , look , they 's hardly anybody in the dining room now , it must be getting late , I 'm kind of hungry myself . It 's funny , funerals make you hungry , I guess it 's feeling so bad and worked up and all . . . " But Leslie was not listening . She put her hand on Adarene Morey 's arm . " Listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here in a minute , she 's always materializing here in the upper hall . Tell her -- here 's the key  --  to bring here to my bedroom some cold chicken and a bowl of fresh fruit and a pot of hot coffee and some bourbon and ice and a quart of champagne  --  and if they haven'tp256any champagne in this big damned arsenal I 'll scream my head off . " " They have , honey . " " I 'll be back . I 'm going to get Jordan . " Downstairs she found him exactly as she had left him , a strangely shrunken giant surrounded by other , giants who seemed to have gained in height and breadth in the half hour that had elapsed since last she saw them . As always the men now assumed different faces as they turned toward her , a woman ; the faces they would put on for conversation with a child . " Well , Miz Benedict , you 're holding up mighty well and so is old Bick here . It 's sad occasions like this and how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of . . . . " She heard them , she replied only with that agreeable grimace which , very early in her Washington and Virginia social life , she had learned would pass for conversation in a pinch . She came close to Bick , she spoke very low in his ear . " Come with me , dear . " He shook his head . " No . I 'm all right . " She faced the men . " Jordan is exhausted . He has n't slept or eaten . I 'm trying to have him rest before the evening  --  uh  --  " she had almost said the evening session  --  " before the evening . " Appealinglyshe looked up into those big tan faces . " I feel quite faint myself -- but that does n't matter . " They rallied with a boom . " That 's right , Bick , you go ' long . . . . You got to think of yourself and the little girl here . . . . Times like this it 's the ones are left behind got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mind the Missuz and go ' long , now . " Toward the hall , toward the stairway , her hand on his arm . In the hall melee they encountered Uncle Bawley battling his way toward the open outer door . " Uncle Bawley ! Where are you going ? " " See you all tomorrow . " He dabbed at his eyes . " But dinner . Have you had dinner ? " " I 'm eating with Dietz over to the line house . "  | " Jordan 's going upstairs to rest just a little while . You 'll be back this evening ? " She wished Jordan would say something . Uncle Bawley shook his head , the teardrops flew right and left . " Crowds aggravate it . Anyway , I turn in at eight . " " Eight ! " " Up at four . See you tomorrow , Bick . " He strode off . They were ascending the stairs when he came up behind them , he grasped Bick 's arm , he jerked a thumb toward Leslie , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexceptional , " he said earnestly . Was off down the stairs and out of the door . Lupe had been partially efficient for once ; the bowl of fruit was there , the bourbon , a bottle of champagne in a nest of ice . " What 's this ? " Bick asked testily . " This , darling , is what 's known as food and drink , and the rest of it will be along in a minute . I hope . " The great brass sun was descending now in the vast tin sky , she opened the jalousies a little , she wished she could open the door so that the Gulf wind would meet the draft that funneled through the house , and at least move the air with a semblance of coolness . Bick stumbled into the bathroom as Petra flung open the bedroomdoor without knocking , a habit that from the first moment Leslie had found maddening . Petra and Lupe carried trays , there was no table laid , Leslie cleared a space on the desk-table . She saw with utter dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate cold slices in a nest of crisp green was a vast hot boiled fowl with gobbets of yellow fat marbling its skin , its huge thighs turned upward , steaming . There was a bowl of hot mashed potatoes and a wet greenish mass that looked like boiled beet tops . These bowls she picked up , one in each hand , and gave them to Petra and Lupe . " Take them . Take them away . " But they shook their heads , they placed the bowls again on the tray , Lupe , the older , spoke in Spanish as always , her voice low but vibrant with insistence . Leslie caught a familiar word or two  --  " patata . . . con carne . . . senor . . . " The senor likes potatoesalways with his meat . All right . I 'm being quite a clever girl , she thought , with my new Spanish . She smiled , she nodded ,  |p258she  urged them from the room . She busied herself with the trays . The bathroom splashings and puffings had ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sagging lines were partly erased . " What 's this ? " he asked as before , viewing the table with distaste . " It 's chicken , " she said briskly . " I ordered it cold and they brought it hot . This is potato , I ca n't imagine why , and that 's some sort of dreadful greens . And this is your wife . Remember ? " She came to him , she stood before him , she placed her cool slim hands on his cheeks . He bent his head and kissed her perfunctorily and walked away from her and seated himself in a chair by the window away from the food . " A drink , " she said . " You can have bourbon or you can have champagne , one or the other . You ca n't have both because one is grain and one is grape and they say you must n't mix them . The French say so . " He looked down at his hands , he turned them over and inspectedhis palms as though expecting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? They sure ought to know . You 're hell-bent on civilizing me , are n't you ? " " Champagne I think , " she said , and plunked ice into the glasses to cool them and gave the bottle a twirl . " Bourbon lasts longer but champagne 's quicker . Open this , will you , dear ? " " Celebrating , are n't you ? " he said , his eyes ugly . I 'm going to take over now , she told herself . I 'm going to go right straight through , I 'm going to jolt him out of this . " No . I just wanted to make you eat a little and rest a little because if you do n't you 'll be ill . And because I love you . I was n't thinking of Luz at the moment . " He passed his hand over his forehead and brought the hand down and wiped its palm on his handkerchief . " I did n't mean  --  I 'm all mixed up today . " " But now you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luz or us . And it is better that it was Luz . " He brought his head down to his two clasped hands . She camep259to him and knelt on the floor and put her hand on his shoulder . " Jordan , after this is over and everything is quiet , Jordan darling , could n't we close this house or just use it for guests or something  --  there are so many here all the time  --  could n't we open the old house  --  the little Main House  --  and live in that , you and I ? " " Why ? What for ? " He had raised his head . He was listening . " I like it . It 's a house . I 'd love to live in it . " He looked around the room now , she saw that his mind was looking at the rooms and rooms and rooms that made up this fantastic pile rearing its bulk on the plains . " What 's the matter with this house ? " " It 's like living in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and sentries . It 's Alcatraz  --  without charm . And then those miserable shanties down there where the Mexicans live . " " I noticed your nigger cabins in the dear old South were n't so sumptuous . " " I know . But neither are the sumptuous old mansions sumptuousany more . The South has been busted for almost a century . And Texas is booming . Papa says that twenty-five years from now the cabins and the mansions will disappear in a new indus-trial " Forget what Papa says . " " All right . Your father built this house . Do you feel sentimental about it ? " At last he was jolted out of his numbness . He stood up as though jerked to his feet . " I hate it . I 've always hated it . Ma hated it too . The only person who likes it is  --  was  --  Luz . " His head drooped again . Now ! she thought . " I want our son to be born in the little old house . " " Son ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son . No real Benedict would consider anything but a male first child . And I want him to be born in the house where his father was born . "  |p261THE  GIRLS said she ought to get away . " It 's fierce here July and August , even for us Texians , and we 're raised on it . " Proudly they quoted astronomical Fahrenheit figures . " Your condition and all , Leslie . " " My condition 's fine . Fine and normal . My adrenal glands are working like a pumping station , Doctor Tom says . I 'm a mass of energy . " " Yes , but just you wait , " they predicted darkly . " I 'll have to . Unless they 've modernized that old nine months ' schedule . It 's odd , is n't it ? but the heat seems to stimulate me inp262some crazy way . Jordan says I whirl so fast that he has to go out in the pasture and look at the big windmills to rest his eyes . " The Girls fancied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or eleven in the morning . They arrived with their hair in pins , they sat they talked they drank gallons of coffee . Or they telephoned in the morning . They sat at the telephone and talked and drank coffee . These time-wasting habits drove Leslie to quiet desperation . Mr. and Mrs. Jordan Benedict were moving out of the Big House and into the old Main House . The County rocked with the news . Together Bick and Leslie were supervising the reconstructionof the ancient dwelling . But it was Leslie who majored in the project . Leslie had plans to redecorate and refurnish from eaves to root cellar . She whisked about all day with rainbow-hued swatches of cloth in wool silk canvas felt denim linen chintz dangling from her fingers , stuffing her handbags , pinned crazyquilt-fashionto the front of her dress . She knew exactly what she wanted , her decisions were almost instantaneous , her taste unerring , but no one was safe from her happy plans . It was as though she were giving a huge party and wanted everyone to share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too deep ? Too Mediterranean ? I want it to be the color of the Texas sky . That washed grey-blue . This pale yellow is just right against it , do n't you think ? The lemon-yellow of the huisache in the spring . . . . What a time I had finding this pale green , just the shade of the mesquite . Jordan says he 's spent billions trying to blast the mesquite off Reata and now I 'm bringing it into the house . . . . Is this the color of mountain pinks ? I 've never seen them but if Jordan takes me up to Holgado later perhaps they 'll still . . . " Bits of paper flapped in the wind . Daubs of paint waited for approval on newly plastered walls . Chairs chests tables beds appearedremained or vanished . Leslie carried notebooks and a sixfootmetal measuring tape that sprang out at you like a snake , whirring and rattling . Her supercharged energies encompassed Spanish lessons as well . She had discovered in the town of Bene/dict a sad-eyed professorial man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranchers and Drovers Bank . " Pure Spanish , " Bick assured Leslie . " Onate 's got no Mexican in him . He 's as Spanish as Alfonso and darned near dates back like a Habsburg , too . His people have been in Texas practically ever since North America cooled off . " Fascinated , Leslie asked , " How many millions of acres does he own ? He looks so defeated , though . " " Not an acre . " " But why ! " " Oh , you 're still that Why Girl . Uh , the Onates sold their Spanish land grants a century ago . " " Mhm , " she said musingly . She supplemented the Onate hours with alternate lessons in the more colloquial Mexican-Spanish lessons given her by the new schoolteacher who now ruled in Cora Dart 's place . " Senor Onate 's Castilian Spanish is all very nice in Madrid court circles but I notice that when I go lisping around the Mexicans do n't know what I 'm talking about . Though all you need to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d' you mean , Texan ? " " Even if you do n't know a word of Spanish you ca n't talk to anyone on Reata  --  to anyone in Texas , for that matter  --  five minutes without using words borrowed from the Spanish . Or Mexican . How about Reata ! Retama . Remuda . Corral . Ranchero . Stampede . Mesa . Canyon . Rodeo . Corral . Sombrero . Pinto . Bronco . Thousands of words . " " Well , naturally . Everybody knows that . " He regarded her fondly . " You really feeling all right , Leslie ? " " Simply superb . And so do you . " Yes , you , she thought . We 're happy , normally naturally happy , because a woman named Luz Benedict is dead , and it 's much healthier to admit it , but he wo n't or ca n't yet . He laughed . " Me ! Well , that 's different . I 'm not exactly uh " Yes you are , in a way . Because you 're in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're one . We 're three in one , really . Whatp264you feel I feel , what I feel you feel , you 're really as pregnant as I am . " " Say , honey , for a girl brought up the way you were you 're pretty rough-talking , are n't you ? " " Rough ? It 's a biological fact that two people in love " All right all right all right ! Suits me fine . Say no more . " His arms about her , his vital being engulfing her . Leslie and Vashti now had a common bond . These first weeks of pregnancy were not , however , flattering to Vashti . The Hake glands did not adjust as skillfully as did the Lynnton . Panting and uncomfortable , Vashti eyed her enceinte neighbor with an expression as near resentment as her naturally placid features could convey . " Lookit the way you look , and then me . It 's made you pretty , almost , your complexion and eyes and all . I got spots and my hair is stringy no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even show . I look seven months instead of seven weeks . Pa does n't even believe that Pinky and I behaved right before we were married , he says . " " It 's because I 'm tall and skinny , " Leslie assured her . " What you all call ganted . Never mind . We 'll both look worse before we 're better . " But Vashti , moist and lumpy , was a disconsolate heap in one of Leslie 's bedroom chairs . She sipped her ubiquitous coffee . " It 's all I can do to sit up , let alone run around the way you do . Run run run with all those samples and stuff . What do you want to go and live in the little Main House for anyway , honey ? It looks like a bad old mill . All these lovely rooms here in the Big House , it 's a palace . Compared to it that old Main House is a Mexican shack . " " Palaces have gone out . Like the people who used to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the knotted brow and the tense jaw , relaxed in this atmosphere of bustle and change and anticipation . He laughed at her , fondly . " You 're trying to make Texas over into Virginia , honey . Next thing you'llp265have me riding in one of those red coats and some big old bull will come along and tromp me to death . " " Why are you Texans so afraid of anything that 's beautiful or moving ! You 're all still stamping around with a gun in one hand and a skillet in the other . You 're still fighting Indians and Mexicansand orange souffles . Give up . Adapt yourselves . They 're here to stay . " He shook his head , hopelessly . " I should have known . That very first morning up there in Virginia when you came down to breakfast blinking like a lighthouse pretending you were wide awake and used to getting up early . Talking a streak about Texas . You 'd never heard of it until you reached out and grabbed me . " " My knight in shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough Brillo . " Grinning he regarded her and his smile faded . " Do you know what ? I think you need to get away . How would it be if you took a breather somewhere cool with Adarene , maybe , or Vashti ? " " Darling , you do n't know very much about wives , do you ? I do n't want to go anywhere until I 've finished the house . And when I do go I want to go with you . " " I 'm up to here in work . " " You always will be . Me too  --  I hope . But I 'd like to see lots of places . San Antonio and the Alamo that they 're always talking about . " " I know . But hot there now . " " Just a day or two . And then we could go up to Uncle Bawley 's in the lovely mountains . Mountains ! " " Girls are n't invited to Uncle Bawley 's . " " This one is . " " No ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He came over to me with his eyes streaming and said , Along about July you get Bick to bring you up to Holgado . No women as a general thing , but you 're different . ' I 've never been so flattered . And some of those Washington boys were n't bad at it . "  | " In July it 's likely to rain up there in Jeff Davis County . " " Oh , it 's that Davis ! " " High up there at Holgado , a mile high some places , the nights are cool . " " It sounds heavenly ! Jordan , ca n't we plan to go perhaps by midsummer ? The house will be set and the ranch can run itself for a little while  --  all these millions of people on it , somebody must have some sense besides yourself . Anyway , I 'm supposed to have whims now , and be humored . " Chip-chip clink-clink hammer-hammer went the tools of the workmen as they pierced the rocklike clay walls of the old Main House , transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , devising closet space , building the wide veranda that Leslie stubbornly insisted would be like an outdoor dwelling added to the house itself . " I wo n't sit indoors all day , like a cave dweller . And it will be cool , with this everlasting breeze , if we shade it and plant a sun-shield of trees , and lots of vines and have everything cool canvas in pale greens and pinks and blues . They do it in the tropics . Why not Texas ! " The old house had originally been built by slow hand labor , its stone and adobe walls were two feet thick , its window embrasures were cavernous , even the fierce shafts of the brush-country summersun could not pierce this century-old fastness . It was cooler than the Big House ever had been . Luz Benedict gone . Jett Rink gone . Cora Dart gone . Harmony . Peace . Home . The Big House became to Leslie as impersonal as the Vientecito depot . Guests came , went , it was like an hotel without a room clerk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie found herself watching a doorway , listening for the quick tap-tap of scurrying boot heels , dreading to see the small vigorous figure , to hear the strident domineering voice dictatingplans to the carpenters and painters . Leslie sensed that Bick , too , sometimes listened and held his breath . At such momentsshe would come to him and slip her arm through his and look up into his face . And she would say , as she had on her honeymoon , " I 'm having a lovely time . "  |p267Almost  fearfully he would bend his head to her lips . " Me too , honey . " " I feel as creative as Leonardo da Vinci , what with the baby going on inside and the house going up outside . " Her letters home were chatty and high-spirited . . . . I do n't want to come back home for a visit now with my figure like a grampus and it 's no good your coming here at this season it 's howling roaring hot but somehow I do n't mind I feel so very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an acrobat . . . . No Mama dearie do n't send a complete layette from Best 's there are really good shops here in Houston and Dallas and Hermoso though I have n't seen them yet , and even in Vientecito near by . . . . Besides , they have showers here , I do n't mean Rain Showers I mean Baby Showers , the Girls give you Baby Showers and bring bootees and bibs and rattles and knitted gips . . . . Everything is different here you must see it . I am beginning to understand it a little . Some of it is wonderful and some of it is horrible , but perhapsthat is true of any place San Francisco California , or Chicago Illinois , or New York New York . But this is n't only an outer difference . You know how these things interest me , Papa . Your fault , I 'm afraid . It 's a difference that has to do with the spirit . Goodness , that looks awful on paper . So smug . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual but no one walks . . . . We are going to a great Fiesta in Vientecito it 's an annual thing , they never have bazaars or fairs or exhibitions in Texas it 's always a Fiesta and everything 's very Spanish or very Mexican or both and yet the real Mexicans are n't allowed to . . . Not gradually , but quite suddenly , she felt that she belonged . She was part of the community . Her unabated curiosity about every aspect of Reata ranch life and the life of the town and the county and the far-flung state itself was a source of mingled amusement and irritation to Bick . He would greet her with a groan and , " Here 's that Why Girl again , " when she appeared at unexpected moments in unlikely places ; when he and Gill Dace , the chief vet , were deep in some bovine experiment at the ranch lab ; or in the midst of one of the rare sales of choice Benedictp268breeding bulls , attended by only the most serious and solvent stockbreeders within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " Look , honey , what did you want to come down to the tent for ! Hot and all that dust and yelling around . That 's no place for a woman . In your condition . " " My condition 's simply elegant and I do n't even look out of drawing yet . Anyway , Luz used to take part in all that , did n't she ? " A muscle in his cheek twitched . " That was different . " " I 'll never huddle in the harem and nibble poppy seed and sew a fine seam . You knew I was a nosy girl when you married me . I did n't deceive you , sir . From the first moment we met I could n't have been more unpleasant . " " True , true , " he murmured . " I only married you because I hoped I could slap you around and bully you into being my ideal little woman . " " Your mistake . You 're stuck with it . Anyway , you know you 're crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grosser side . That fine mind you inherited from your father is pretty damn repulsive . In a woman , that is . " " It 'll come in handy when we 're old gaffer and gammer . " Up and down the ranch . In and out of Benedict . The tradesmenand the townspeople recognized her and greeted her in open friendly Texas fashion . She drove her own car now , for short distances . The workings of the little town , the pattern of its life , of the county life , of the Texas way of living and thinking , began to open up before her observant eye and her keen absorbent mind . " Jordan , what are those streams and streams of old brokendowntrucks and Fords that go through town with loads of Mexicans ? Men and women and boys and girls and even little children . Swarms of them . " " Workers . " " Workers at what ? " " Oh , depends on the time of year . Cotton pickers . And vegetablesand fruit . In the Valley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they 're Mexicans they come from Mexico . Even a bright girl like you can figure that out . " " And when everything 's picked where do they go ? " " Back to Mexico , most of them . A few sometimes hide out and stay , but they 're usually rooted out and tossed back . " She tidied this in her orderly mind . Little bits and pieces marched obediently out of her memory 's ranks and fell into proper place . Coyote . Gomez . Fidel Gomez . Coyote . That 's a name the Mexicans call a chiseler a crook . He lives off of them he sneaks them across the border from Mexico to work as pickers . . . . Time he 's through with them they do n't have nothing left when they get through working in the Valley crops . . . . And he rounds up the Mexican voters and does a lot of dirty jobs . . . . " Where do they live while they 're here , with all those children and everything ? What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake ! " " I just want to know , darling . This is all an everyday bore to you but I 'm brand new , everything 's different and strange to me . I ca n't help it . I am that way . " " I do n't know . Very little . Couple of dollars . Whatever they 're paid it 's more than they 'd get home in Mexico starving to death . " " Where do they live ? " " Camps . And do n't you go near , they 're a mass of dysentery and t.b . and every damn thing . You stay away . Hear me ! " " But if you know that why do n't you stop it ! Why do n't you make them change it ! " " I 'm no vegetable farmer , I 'm no cotton grower . I 'm a cowman . Remember ? " " What 's that got to do with it ! You 're a Texan . You 've been a great big rich powerful Texan for a hundred years . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " No , thank you very much . " " Then I will . " " Leslie . " His face was ominous , his eyes stared at her cold withp270actual dislike . " If you ever go near one of those dumps  --  if I ever hear of your mixing into this migratory mess " " What 'll you do ? " " I swear to God I 'll leave you . " " You ca n't leave Reata . And to get me out you 'd have to tie me up and put me in a trunk or something . And I would n't stay put . I 'd come back . I 'll never leave you . I love you . Even when you glare at me like Simon Legree . " " And you 'd look like Carrie Nation , barging around stuff that 's none of your business . Fixing the world . We 'll be the laughingstockof Texas if this keeps on . I 've heard that women in your condition sometimes go kind of haywire but I never thought my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room , she heard the high-heeled boots clattering down the hall , the slam of the door , horse 's hoofs on sun-baked earth . He 's gone . Where ? Not far . Gill Dace . The Dietzes ' . Old Polo . Anyone who is part of this kingdom . If Luz were alive he 'd be rushing to her , his mother-sister . And she 'd tell him he 's right , he 's always right . Should I do that ? You 're a wife your uh individualityshould be submerged in the I do n't believe it I ca n't I must be myself or I am nothing and better dead . Now sit quietly here in the chair and think . What started this squabble that is one of a hundred we 're always having and then we make up in bed . Then in a day or two or three we are bickering again . Bick bickeringnow pull yourself together do n't be cute . What started this one ? You wanted to know about those thousands of Mexicans piled into trucks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they earn but you must not know this is a state secret so many things are state secrets all the things I am interested in perhaps I am becoming a worthy bore like those Madam Chairmen Madams Chairman anyway those large ladies in uncompromisinghats at Meetings with gavels and pitchers of ice water . Jett Rink . He 's the boy who could whirl me out to one of those camps and tell me all about the pickers . Put that out of your mind . Well then who else because I 've made up my mind I 'm notp271going to sit home and drink coffee and talktalktalk and play bridge in a Southwest harem the rest of my life Jordan was really furious this time I suppose I really am a kind of nuisance to him my darling Jordan . It is still early morning who will drive with me ? Vashti ? No . The new schoolteacher that Miss Minty , no . Besides , she has to teach school do n't be silly . Senor Onate at the bank , no . I wish Adarene were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Adarene . Dimodeo could drive me or one of the men in the garage or the stables . " I 'll go alone , " she said aloud . " Why not ! Do n't be a sissy . After all , the Valley lies just the other side of Nopal , it wo n't take more than two or three hours , the whole thing , I 'll be back in time for lunch . " In her shining little car in her neat silk dress , exhilarated and slightly short of breath from excitement , she tooled along the wide bright road in the wide bright morning . Through Benedict , familiar now , past the fences and fences and fences that were still Reata , into the grey-white somnolent little town of Nopal . The office of Fidel Gomez . That was the thing . He was the one to take her to a camp . He brought them in in droves . Let him explain what it was that Jordan did n't want her to see . In her smart white kid handbag she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western Hemisphere , the cover read . Then neatly , Espanol e ingles ( why the small i , she wondered always ) del Hemisferio Occidental . Fair enough , she said to herself happily . She was enjoyingherself immensely , full of success . The streets were strangely empty , as before . A woman in a black rebozo came toward her . The street boasted no sidewalk , there was only a dirt path . Leslie stopped her car , she waited , she leaned out and called in her stumbling Spanish , " Oficina Senor Fidel Gomez . Favor de  --  uh  --  decirme . " The woman looked at her she looked away she muttered Yo no comprendo , she walked on . A man then . A small dark man with a resigned suffering face and greying hair in the black . Favor de decirme Oficina Senor Fidel Gomez ? The man stoppedp272dead , his eyes swiveled past her , he shrugged , he hurried swiftly on . Well . What was the matter with everybody ! Or what was the matter with her Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have an office . He had been hanging around outside that wineshop or whatever it was , that last time . Maybe that was the place . But Jordan would n't like that , her going there . She would just park outside and blow the horn . Up one dusty little street and down another . Bodega . There , that was it . At the second blast of the horn , as though this were an accustomedform of summons , a figure leaned far out of the doorwayand it was magically Fidel Gomez . Leslie decided not to try a lot of favor de this time . " Come here , Mr. Gomez . " Three faces appeared in the doorwaypeering behind Gomez ' shoulder . With a nervous backward glance he came forward , removing his great Stetson passing his jeweled brown hand over his hair , placing the hat again on his head and again removing it as he stood at the door of the car . And as before she noted that his eyes were wide with apprehension . No nonsense . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you ask " Yes , well , I was talking to my husband this morning and I told him I wanted to see one of the camps  --  you know  --  where the Mexicans work  --  the pickers I mean . Where they live . So I drove over . Will you get in and we 'll drive to one . You 'll have to show me the way . " He shook his head , smiling a little patiently as one would gently chide a child . " No , senora , you would not want to go there . " " But I do . If you do n't take me I 'll go alone . " " You can not do that . " 4 " Do n't tell me what I can or ca n't do ! Is this the United States or is n't it ! " " Oh yes , senora , " he assured her earnestly . " Well , then , get in the car and we 'll go . "  | " I will first telephone . I will call your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's  --  he 's way out on the range or whatever you call it , somewhere . He left early this morning . Get in the car , Mr. Gomez . " Fidel Gomez pointed to a large bright scarlet automobile blazing proudly under the rays of the Southwest sun . " My automobileis there . " " Oh . Well ? " " If you will permit I will drive before you and you will please to follow me . We will stop at my house if you will honor me and my wife . We will drink coffee . " " No ! Really no . I ca n't . I do n't drink much coffee Very gravely , " It is ten o'clock . My wife will be honored . She will , of course , come with us . " She looked at him standing there , so bland so obsequious so immovableso  --  I never knew how to pronounce it , she thought , but the word is imperturbable . He bowed now , he entered his car and preceded her , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a neat square white box . Mrs. Fidel Gomez was a neat square dark box . Mrs. Gomez spoke absolutely no English , the Coyote informed Leslie when she tried to assure Mrs. Gomez that coffee was not necessary and that Mrs. Gomez ' presence on this expedition was not necessary . " My wife is happy to accompany us , " Fidel Gomez assured Leslie . " She is honored . She will come with us . First we will have coffee . " In Mrs. Gomez ' round olive Latin-American face and in Mrs. Gomez ' round black eyes Leslie detected a faint flash of AngloAmericanwifely resentment . She then vanished briefly while Leslie , in a quiet fury , and the Coyote in a pattern of correct Mexican etiquette sat on the edges of their chairs and conversed . A parlor set in a large-patterned combination of plush and flowered stuff . A large bridal photograph , gold-framed . And in a corner the household altar with its gaily colored images and its paper flowers , its candles and incense burners and the cross . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babbled ,  |p274feeling  foolish . " And Mexican , of course . Whole families in those trucks . Even babies and old men and women . They ca n't work , can they ? Children of seven or eight , they seemed . And quite old old people ? " " Excuse me , " said the Coyote . " One moment only . " " It 's no use your telephoning my husband . He 's not there . " " Excuse me . One moment only . " When he returned , " What are they paid ? " she asked , relentlessly . Mrs. Gomez appeared , carrying a tray . She had changed from her neat house dress to a tight and formal black . The ritual proceeded . They drank the strong black sweet coffee eying one another over the cup 's edge , crooking their little fingers , fuming and smiling . He is being correct , Leslie realized . He is following an absolutely correct plan of conduct for a coyote toward a Benedict . Click-click cup on saucer , sip-sip coffee on tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up time for some reason . Jordan . Abruptly she rose . " I am going now . If you wish to come with me , come . But you need n't . I can find a camp alone . " At a word from him Mrs. Gomez gathered the cups and in stately silence carried them away . A moment later the three stood facing the two cars by the roadside . " Would you and Mrs. Gomez like to ride with me ? Or . . . ? " She sensed there was some sort of protocol here . The stiff and unconvincing smile still on his face . " It will be more comfortable for you if my wife and I we drive in my car to show the way . You will follow in your car . In that way Uh-huh , she thought . He is not to be seen driving with the wife of Jordan Benedict . " Lovely , " she said , matching smile for smile . " But I want to see a camp . No nonsense . " " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the senora stuff , she noted . Each in the burning-hot front seat of a car . Off . A mile , two three four . There was the Gomez hand flipping a stop signal at the left of the red car . And there was a desolate trampled piecep275of land by the roadside . And there were the broken camp shacks and the sheds ; there were the crazy outhouses . A low-slung crawling dog , lean as a snake . No human thing moved in the camp . Fidel Gomez came around the back of his car and stood at the door of Leslie 's car as it stopped . He leaned an arm against the sill and smiled . " It is not worth to get out , " he said . " There is no person there . " " Why not ? " " What is here is working , picking . The season here is near the end . " She looked at the barren field . No shade from the cruel sun . " But I saw little children in those trucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pans . And old people . " " They are picking . " Sharply she jerked the brake , locked the car , dropped the keys neatly into her handbag . " I 'm going to get out and see the place . " Her challenging eyes met his flat depthless black ones and in that instant she saw two little red points leap at the center of his pupils . Two little red devils , she told herself . How strange . I 've never seen that before . She stepped out , shook her rumpled skirts , adjusted her hat . " Mrs. Gomez ? " She was almost relieved to notice that he no longer wore the smile . " My wife will sit in the automobile . She will wait . " She walked down into the roadside ditch and up the other side and into the smothering dust of the bare field . Now she saw that there were ragged small tents beyond the sagging sheds . She walked swiftly toward the nearest shed . She heard his footsteps just behind her . She peered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor ; blankets , too , spread there as though the sleepers had risen from them and left them as they were ; some sagging collapsible beds . No one . Two or three rusty stoves , open and unlighted , stood incongruously in the open field . Here and there on the ground you saw the ashes of what had been an open fire.  | " You see , " came the voice of Fidel Gomez , always just behind her , " there is no one , they are all busily at work in their jobs . A good thing . " Now she heard a low murmur of talk . Gingerly , and feeling somehow embarrassed , she peered into one of the ragged pup tents . A woman lay on a mattress on the ground . Squatting on her haunches at the side of the mattress was an old woman . The two looked wordlessly , without a sign of resentment , at the chic silken figure that held aside the open tent flap . " Oh , I 'm so sorry . Please excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring . Then , over her shoulder to Gomez , " There 's someone here . Please tell them in Spanish I 'm sorry to have  --  I mean intruding like this " as if she hadblundered , unbidden , into a formal dwelling . " I speak English , " said the girl on the mattress . " Oh , how nice ! " Leslie said . " Are you ill ? " " I have had a baby , " the girl said . " How lovely ! " Leslie said . " He is dead , " the girl said . Leslie took a step forward and let the tent flap fall , so that she stood within and Gomez outside . The heat under the canvas was stifling . " When ? " " Last night . " Then , at the look in Leslie 's eyes : " They took him away this morning , early , before my husband went to work , and the others . " " Let me help you . Let me Where is your home ? Are youMexican ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Leslie , accustomed to the half-light of the tent , saw that the pinched and greyish face was that of a girl not more than seventeen . She felt her own face flamingscarlet . There ! she said to herself . Take that ! " I have my car here . If you 're able  --  could I somehow take you home ? I 'd be glad to help . You and your  --  mother ? " " My home is Rayo . Near the border . There is no one there . We are all here , working . This "  --  with a little gesture of formality  --  " isthe mother of my husband . "  | " Working , " Leslie repeated dully . She began to feel strange and unreal . Then , to her own horror , " Who ? " " All of us . Tomorrow I will work , or the next day . My husband and my brother and my husband 's brother and my sister and my husband 's mother . " She had to know . " How much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little stir outside the tent . The girl did not seem to find the question offensive or even unusual , she answered with the docility of one who never has known privacy . " Together it is six dollars a week . " " Six ! " " Sometimes seven . Sometimes five . " " All ? " " Sure all . " Leslie opened her smart white handbag . Sick with shame at what she was doing . A crumpled little roll of bills there  --  tentwenty  --  shedid n't know . Miserably she stepped forward , she stooped and placed it on the mattress . " Please , " she said in a small wretched voice . " For the baby . I  --  please do n't mind . " The girl said nothing . The old woman said nothing . They looked at the money , their faces expressionless . Abruptly Leslie turned and stumbled through the tent flap into the blinding sunshine , she bumped into the man standing so close to the flap but she went on unheeding until a stench that was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were the open latrines , fly-covered , an abomination beneath the noonday sun . The early morning quarrel , the drive , the hot sweet coffee , the shock , the heat , the stench now gathered themselves tightly togetherlike a massive clenched fist to deal Mrs. Jordan Benedict an effective blow to the diaphragm . She was violently sick on the dust-covered scabland . Delicately Fidel Gomez turned away.  |p278NO  , HE HAD NOT come in at midday , they told her . But then , he rarely did . White and shaking she put herself to bed . No , no coffee , she said in her halting Spanish to Lupe ; and put her hand quickly to her mouth . She lay there in the heat of the day , quiveringa little now and then with an inexplicable chill . The sounds of the great house and of the outdoors came to her with curious remoteness as though filtered through a muffled transmitter . The hammering and clinking of tools wielded by the workmen busy with the remodeling of the Main House . Far-off voices from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always there werep279guests here at the Big House , half the time she scarcely knew who they were , or what their purpose there . Hoofbeats . It was one of the sounds she loved . She dozed a little . Words drifted through a mist . I have had a baby . How lovely ! He is dead . Leslie turned over on her elbow and began to cry , ceased to cry and fell asleep . She awoke refreshed , she bathed , she dressed herself in one of her trousseau tea gowns , tried a dab of rouge , regarded herself critically in the mirror , decided that pallor was more effective for her purpose , even if less flattering , wiped off the rouge . She read and listened . She wrote a letter and listened . The crude clangor of the dinner gong . The voices of guests in the hall , the tap-tap of high-heeled boots . He had not come up and when she went downstairs , her head high her spirits low , he was not there . How do you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? Oklahoma ! No , I have n't but of course I 've heard so much about it . Yes , he usually is but he is so very busy at this time of year . They sat at dinner , eleven in all , she could see the doorway and the great hall beyond but he did not come and she ate quite a surprising dinner and talked and listened and said I hope you will excuse me I have been a little not really ill but under the Texas weather . With a society laugh . Back in her room she took up some sewing . She sat near the lamp and made small stitches . The Little Mother To Be . She hated sewing . She wadded up the stuff and tossed it aside , she took up her book but a slow hard hot kernel of anger was forming in her vitals . I really hate him , she said . I hate all of it . I loathe and despise it . She leaned back and looked straight ahead at nothing , her eyes wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , worn out by emotion and the heat . When she awoke Bick was seated across the room . He was looking at her , his arms hanging loosely on either side , his legs sprawled . She was wide awake . In silence they stared at each other . Hammer hammer hammer . But the workmen had gone . It was her heart . She stood up . He stood up . They came together , they were not conscious of having walked or run or even moved.  |p281They  were together . She could not be near enough . " Closer , " she demanded insistently . " Closer closer . " Flushed and disheveled then she lay in his arms . " That Gomez telephoned ? " " Yes . " " What 's so terrible about it ! What 's so terrible about going to look at a Mexican work camp ? " " Sh ! Never mind . I talked to Adarene . " " Here ? " " No , Dallas . I called her . She thinks you 're due for a change . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days . " " Oh , Jordan ! When ? " " Right away . Adarene said they could start tomorrow , if we can . But I said day after tomorrow . " Her disappointment was like a knife thrust . " Ca n't we go alone , just you and I ? It would be so wonderful if we could go alone . " " It would . I know . But there are a lot of things I 've got to talk to Lew about . Luz 's will and a lot of things . He knows the whole family setup . And Vashti and Pinky are " No no no ! Please ! Not the Snyths too ! " " It 's ranch business , honey . " " I ca n't see why that 's a reason for traveling in bunches , like a safari . " " Texans always do . It 's a hangover , I reckon , from the old ( lays when if they did n't stick together they 'd be scalped by Indians or lose their way or get bitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A string of automobiles ? Or perhaps all of us in big hats on palominos with old Polo in the lead like a Buffalo Bill Wild West parade . " " My bittersweet bride . I thought we 'd drive as far as San Antonio  --  if you still insist on a day there , in the heat . The Moreys will come down from Dallas and meet us there . I do n't want you to take a long trip by automobile . From there we 'll go by train , a private car , San Antonio to Holgado . " " Like royalty . "  | " In the last fifty years that road has made enough off us to give us private parlor cars for shipping beef cattle , if we want it . " Before they slept she told him of her day at Nopal . It was cleansing to her , like a confessional , until he said , " But it 's got nothing to do with us . " " But it has ! It is us ! " Sadly , almost desperately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being like that ? Are you always going to be like that ? " " Always , " she said . Bick at the wheel , Pinky and Vashti following in the car behind them , they started Texas fashion two days later in the dim starlit dawn . Into the hot old romantic city of San Antonio with its hot new commercial streets like the streets of any modern American city , North or South East or West . Leslie made no comment , she was crushed by disappointment . They passed the Plaza with its towering office buildings its busy bus station its crowds milling up and down the streets . " Alamo , " Bick said briefly , and pointed to a dust-colored building with its dust-colored wall . " That . " Her voice flat . Ignoring the modern St. Anthony Hotel they went to the Menger because the Benedicts always stayed at the Menger . It was old Texas with its patio and its red plush and its double beds ; its smell of bourbon and bay rum and old carpets and fried food and ancient dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots and the clink of spurs . " Well , that 's more like it ! " Leslie exclaimed , heartily . " I love it . " You 're pleased by the damnedest things , " Bick said . " You turn up your nose at the Big House and here 's this hotel filled like a museum with the same kind of Texas stuff " That 's different , " she argued airily . " Who wants to live in a museum ! Jordan , when we really move into the Main House let 's not have a visitor stay overnight there , ever . It will be our house . They can stay at the Big House , I do n't care who they are.  |p283Royalty  or even Papa and Mama or Maudie Lou or any other Benedict . " " I 've always heard about this Virginia hospitality , " he jibed . Vashti knocked at their door , you could hear her eager smallgirlvoice chattering with Pinky like a child at a party . In they bounced . Ten minutes later the Moreys arrived from Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came tinkling down the corridor , Adarene , as quietly executive as a professional guide , took the plans in hand . Immediately the three men went into a small huddle . Bick made a large gesture . " Anything you girls say is all right with us . " " You look simply lovely , Leslie , " Adarene said . Then , hurriedly , " You too , Vashti . Now girls , we 've only got this one day and part of tomorrow , and it 's awfully hot , even for San Antonio . Let 's get organized . Though I do n't think you two are ideally fixed for sight-seeing just now , I must say . " " Nonsense . We 're full of demon energy , " Leslie said . " The Alamo . That 's the first thing . " But Adarene had made her plans more dramatically . " No , you 've got to work up to the Alamo . The Missions come first . " " Now just a minute , " Bick objected , emerging from the huddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those . Every step is a foot high , they twist like a rope , it gets you in the thighs and the knees and the calf of the leg . I 'm not going to have my son born with corkscrew legs . " " That 's right , " Vashti agreed . " I never will forget the first time I visited San Antonio , Pa brought me , I was fifteen . Everythingin one day . I did all the Missions , one right after another . Concepcion was n't so hard , and then that cute little San Franciscode la  --  something Espada I think . Anyway , couple others , and by the time I got to San Jose Mission I was beat , I did n't know about those twenty-three stairs built like a fan so you kind of meet yourself climbing up to the tower . Next day I was like somebody had their legs cut off and pinned back on with safety pins . They would n't hold me up . Crippled . "  | " I wo n't do them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them and climb just one stairway . The San Jose one , Jordan ? " " Not the San Jose , " firmly . " It 's sort of a novelty , being considered fragile . " Adarene eyed her thoughtfully . " I was just thinking . Maybe we should have gone right on up to Holgado . " " Stop hovering , dearies . Yes , it 's hot . And I 'm having a lovely time . " Lucius Morey , that strange mixture of Vermont and Texas , Lew the unloquacious , in his dark business suit and his plain black shoes and neat white shirt and the incongruous Stetson hat , had sat silent while the talk eddied about him . The bland face , the keen light blue eyes now turned toward Leslie . He spoke in that nasal dry tone that they termed his Coolidge voice . " Leslie , you 're a real fine girl , " he said gravely . Leslie did not share in the laugh that greeted this pronouncement . Just as gravely she said , " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texan , here in San Antonio . " " No wonder . This is where the whole thing began , " Bick explained . " I do n't mean the Spanish Missions and all that . This is the real beginning of Texas . This is where two old boys , flat broke and in their fifties , met up on the Plaza . One of them was the Baron de Bastrop and the other was old Moses Austin . This was San Antonio de Bexar in those days . And Americans were about as welcome in Texas then as " As Mexicans are now , " Leslie said . " Texas history is real interesting , " Vashti offered . " Only nobodyknows anything about it only Texans . Easterners always yapping about Bunker Hill and Valley Forge and places like that , you 'd think the Alamo and San Jacinto were some little fracas happened in Europe or someplace . Look how important they were ! If it had n't been for Sam Houston , and Bowie with that knife of his , and Davy Crockett and Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , can you imagine ! No Texas ! " " Vashti , do n't give any Texas lectures when Leslie 's around , "  |p285Bick  advised her . " She began to bone up on Texas ten minutes after she met me . By now she knows so much Texas history she makes old Frank Dobie look like a damyankee . " " Let 's get going , " Pinky cautioned them . " Maybe Leslie knows more but Vash can outtalk any historian living or dead . Say , Bick , you ever tell Leslie about how Texas has got the right to split up if it has a mind to ? " " No , " Leslie said , mystified . " Split up ? How ? " " Oh , all right , " Bick groaned . " They put it in the state constitutionwhen Texas joined the Union . She would n't join otherwise . It says Texas has the right to split itself into five separate states any time it wants to . " Leslie stared , unbelieving . " Like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactfully , " that reproduces by breaking off pieces of itself . " " If we ever do it , " Lucius Morey reflected , " we 'll have enough United States senators down here in the Southwest to run the whole damn country . " " Never will though , " Adarene announced with definiteness . " Texas 'll never split itself because if it did it would n't be able to say it was the biggest state , and being biggest is what we yell about most . " " Anyway , all five pieces would want to claim the Alamo for itself , " Pinky concluded , " so I guess we 're yoked for life . " " San Antonio 's rigged for the tourist , " Lucius Morey said , " but back of the bunco it 's the real thing anyway , somehow . It 's an old Spanish city real enough , with a flower in its hair and a guitar handy . " The narrow river meandered through the town like the stream of tourists , doubling on itself , turning up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush-country Texan momentarily forgot about the miles of mesquite and the endless plain . Hermoso had n't this look , or Houston or Dallas or Vientecitoor Austin . Adobe huts two hundred years old crouched in the shadow of skyscrapers . Blood and bravery and beauty and terror and the glory of the human spirit were written in the history ofp286these winding streets . They had been trails stamped out by the feet of conquistadores and of padres and the early Spanish settlers . And by the hoofs of the Castilian cattle brought in by the Spaniards in i6go . Their wild offspring , caught and bred again and again through the centuries to Longhorns Shorthorns Angus Hereford Brahmans Kashmirs , were to become the monolithic monsters who fed on the nutritious grasses of Reata Ranch . Leslie bought a guidebook and a concise history of the city , modern and debunked . She walked about reading from these , one finger between the pages , her gaze going from book to object in approved tourist fashion . " You ca n't do that ! " the Texans protested , outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who named it San Antonio ? " The Texans stared at one another . " Uh Her forefinger traced down the page . " Let 's see . . . Don Domingo Teran de los Rios , with Father Damian Massanet and an escort of fifty soldiers . . . June 169 1 . . . came upon rancheria of Payayas . . . What 's a Payaya ? " " Indian tribe , " Bick replied briskly . " Wonderful word , is n't it ?  --  all those ya-yas in it . I never heard of them . " Emboldened by Bick 's success , " A branch of the Comanches , I believe , " Lucius Morey ventured . " Mean-acting Indians , the Comanches were . " " Look , Leslie , " Vashti objected . " This way we 'll never get to show you anything . Why ca n't you just see things and not have to know about how they got there and everything .

Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura 01i I don'tknow why it makes me happy just to say all those words and to know about Payayas and those poor little fifty soldiers . But it does . " " It reads real pretty , " Pinky agreed . " If there 's one thing about San Antonio , it 's history . " " Who 's showing who Texas , that 's what I want to know ! " Vashti demanded , somewhat sulkily for her . " Indians . Who cares about Indians and soldiers and stuff ! The Mexican quarter is real picturesque , they wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidebook under her arm and turned to a passage she had marked in the modern volume . " Uh , San Antoniois the pecan-shelling center of the Southwest . The industry employs about twelve thousand Mexican workers in the Mexican Quarter . . . uh . . . average piecework wage for a 54-hour week is $1.56 . . . . " Gently Bick Benedict took the book from her hands and closed it . " How would you have liked it if I 'd told you how Vir-ginia " But we stumble all around Europe with our noses in Baedekers . I do n't see why we should n't know about our own sights . " The tactful Adarene to the rescue . Pinky settled it . " The Benedicts have been in these parts for about a hundred years now . Anybody around here see Bick Benedictwith his face in a guidebook , he 's liable to be run out of the state of Texas . " " Oh , my land let 's get going . " Vashti again . So off they went to visit the musty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with its dry terse accounts of incredible deeds in which padres and Indians and Spanish grandees , slaughter and agriculture and sculpture and frescoes were fantastically mingled . " The walls of Mission Concepcion are forty-five inches thick , " Leslie read . " Think of it ! The Indians built them with almost no tools . And the monks . " She read on . " Acanthus leaves . . . frontp288facade . . . Renaissance influence of the Churrigueresque school of Spanish Baroque . . . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake , Leslie ! " They ate Mexican food to the strumming of the Mexicans ' guitars on the Plaza . Spicy burning food . Tortillas . Enchiladas . Mole de guajolote . " What 's that ? " Leslie asked . " Terrific turkey thing , " Bick explained . " It 's the top Mexican dish . Turkey with a sauce made of  --  oh  --  chiles and ground almondsand all kinds of spices and chocolate " Chocolate ! " The musicians in their charro clothes . Shadowy figures in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strange exotic smells . Leslie fell silent . Bick touched her hand . " Come on back to us , honey . What are you thinking about way off there ? " She turned toward him gravely . " I was thinking of Boston . " " Boston ! " " I mean  --  it 's a kind of wonderful country , is n't it ? I mean  --  I was thinking about how it all hangs together somehow even when it 's as different as  --  I was thinking about Boston because San Antonio and Boston are absolutely the most different  --  the Ritz Hotel in Boston . That cool green dining room with the long windows looking out on the Common . Those big elm-tree branches make a pattern against the glass . And those dowdy Boston women and the agreeable Boston men with their long English heads . And the lobster so sweet and fresh and tender and the heavy white linen and the waiters ' beautiful clean white fingernails . And old Faneuil Hall . " She stopped , she looked into their disapproving faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just meant it 's just a kind of wonderful country altogether I mean " Her voice trailed off into nothing . She was noticeably silent in the Alamo . " I guess maybe you were oversold on it in the first place , " Lucius Morey said . " All Yankees are . Anyway , the Alamo is a feeling , not a place . " All around the adobe walls swirled the life of a modern city.  |p289Big  business streamed in and out of the department stores , in and out of the new post office , in and out of the bus station . The old tragic Alamo with its history of blood and bravery was a new Alamo , reconstructed within an inch of its life . Picture postcards . Souvenirs . At a desk in the great grey stone hall sat a schoolteacherly woman in spectacles who eyed the visitor with detached severity . The figures moving about the dim room tiptoed as in a cathedral and their voices dropped to a whisper . In the glass cases were the mementos . Proof of the mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  men who had come to this Texas wilderness from Massachusetts and Tennessee , from Virginia and Louisiana and Connecticut . In the glass cases under lock and key were the famed long-rifles that had barked so hopelessly against the oncoming enemy . Neat and cold and quaint in their glass caskets the long-rifles lay now , with their ornamental brass eagles and their six-foot unavailing barrels . And there was the slashing knife of Bowie . Bowie , on his cot in the crumbling Alamo fortress , Bowie already dying of typhoid and pneumonia and exposure and alcohol , wielding the pistols and the knife from his cot bed until they ran him through with their bayonets and it was finished . The letters under glass too  --  stiff formal letters written in extremityby desperate men . " . . . Your favour of the 11 Inst came safe to hand by the last mail and I will hasten to answer the contents . " He must indeed hasten , this Davy Crockett who wrote so politely , for he was soon to die for Texas  --  for this strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined brave Bowie of the terrible knife and the glory-seeking Travis all fought for and died for , though they had perhaps little legal right to do either . Tourists trailed through the garden , through the chapel , through the museum , whispering and pointing and staring . Young bridal couples , honeymooning . Middle-aged ranchers , their highheeledboots clicking on the stone floors , their wives plumplyp290corseted in city clothes . Leslie watched a stout dark-skinned Mexicanwith his wife and three small children . Their faces were impassiveas they looked at the knives , the guns , the flags . They were neatly dressed in their best . The woman trailed a little behind the man , and stared and quieted the restless infant in her arms . There at the far end of the dim room were the six flags that had flown in sovereign authority over this violent and capricious state . Draped and festooned , they made a brilliant splash of color against the grey stone wall . The flag of ancient Spain . Of France . Of Mexico . Of the Republic of Texas . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty years of violence of struggle , of unrest . Leslie Benedict stood in the shadows of the great vaulted room , her head averted . " Do n't mind me . Pretend you 're not with me . I cry at parades , too , so do n't mind me . " She stood there in the room that had become a sort of shrine to the arrogant swaggering giant  --  Texas . Texas . Jett Rink . JordanBenedict . Adarene Morey . Doctor Tom Walker . Angel Obregon . Pinky Snyth . Uncle Bawley . Vashti Hake . She stared at the festooned flags and the colors misted and became faces and the faces faded and the folds of the flags began to ripple strangely . " Heh , you feeling funny , Leslie ? " Bick , his arm around her shoulder , his eyes searching her face with concern . " No . I 'm feeling fine . The flags . I suppose I stared at them so long the colors made me dizzy . " " You 've just about seen it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest ? Before we make the train . " " In just a little while . I want to see the pictures . Just the pictures , and then we 'll go . " Oil paintings made vivid splashes of scarlet and blue and gold against the walls . Men in buckskin breeches . Men in battle . Men dying . Men attacking . Invariably there were the brave white Americans rising superior over the dark-skinned Mexicans . Even if they were about to die they fought on , facing their adversaries with fortitude and an expression of civilized superiority.  |p291The  Mexican and his wife and children had finished gazing at the old guns and knives and battered mementos in the glass cases , and puzzling over the faded ink of Travis ' desperate letters : Commandancy of Bexar , Feb. 23d. 3 o'clock P.M. 1836 To Andrew Ponton , Judge , and Citizens of Gonzales : The enemy in large force is in sight . We want men and provisions . Send them to us . We have 150 men and are determined to defend the Alamo to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were standing just beside Leslie now staring at the paintingsin oil of those to whom the men and the provisions never came . Here in crude glowing colors were depicted the darkskinnedmen in natty bright uniforms and the white-skinned men in the bloodstained shirts and the buckskins of the storied pioneer , and the dark men were hacking with knives and shooting with guns at the valiant white-faced men , and the faces of the one were ferocious and of the other agonized and brave . And which was right and which was wrong ? Leslie asked herself . And which was aggressor and which defender ? Beside her the Mexican and his wife with the child in her arms and the two wide-eyed children gazed at the pictures and the oldest child  --  the boy  --  pointed and asked a question , puzzlement in his eyes and in his voice . And the man replied in Spanish , lowvoiced . " Better watch out , Bick ! " Pinky said . " Your wife 's got that look in her eye ca n't tear herself away from Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed as he took Leslie 's arm . " They were both great boys with the ladies . Which is it , Leslie ? They 're good and dead , so I do n't have to mind too much . " Leslie turned as though she had not heard . " You were right about sight-seeing . I am rather tired . " " You take things too hard , " said the practical Vashti . " What was it you were so upset about in there ? "  | " It could be so wonderful . " " What could ? What could be so wonderful ? " " Texas . " " Texas ! Listen at her ! Texas is wonderful . Honestly , Leslie , sometimes I think you 're real horrid , the way you talk . " Bick 's arm was about his wife 's shoulder . " It used to rile me too , Vashti , until I caught on . It 's what they call impersonal ob-servation . " Briskly Adarene Morey said , " Anyway , we 've all had enough of Missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to get on that train . " " When we 're all settled on the train let 's order something wonderfulfor supper , " Vashti suggested as they walked down the Alamo garden path . " Steaks , " Pinky said . " No ! " the women shrieked . Vashti 's plump pink face took on the look of a misty-eyed dreamer . " What I 'd love is regular train food you never get anywhere else , hardly . Chicken potpie with teensy onions in the cream gravy , and corn muffins and that salad with Roquefort cheese dressing and for dessert blueberry pie a la mode with chocolate ice cream . " " You all right , Leslie ? " Adarene inquired anxiously , as her friend turned noticeably pale . " I 'm all right , " said Leslie . " Holgado . Is it really cool ? " 293THE SPECIAL CAR had been docilely waiting for them on the siding at San Antonio , ready to be picked up by the crack express that hurtled across the continent to the Mexican border and beyond into Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old family servitor . He knew who took charged water , who took branch water , who took it straight ; the Benedicts and the Moreys and the Hakes apparently had been part of his railroadlife for years . He greeted them like long-lost benefactors . " Well , this is mighty nice , " Lucius Morey said and sank into one of the great plushy seats with the air of one who has come home after a hard day 's work.  |p294Pinky  tossed his big Stetson with an expert twirl so that it landed neatly in the overhead rack at a distance of twenty feet . " I have n't done so much walking since one time my horse died on me middle of the desert . I had to lug my old kack twenty miles afoot . Nothing beats you out like sight-seeing . " " That 's right , " Bick agreed . " I 'd rather do a day 's roundup than one more Mission . " The jaunt took on a holiday air . Everyone felt relaxed . Vashti bubbled . " Ooh , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue is n't that cute I never saw blue before on a train it 's always green . . . " " George , we 'll want a setup right away , plenty of ice . . . " " That goes there and this goes here  --  no , the Benedict drawingroom . . . " " A menu from the dining car we 'll eat right here . . . " The three men then said " Phew ! " and glanced toward the little pantry from which came the tinkle of ice and glass . A waiter in a cardboard-stiff white apron and jacket appeared with menus . " Tengo hambre , " Pinky yelled . " Come on , amigos , let 's get together on this . Vash ! Girls ! " The three women emerged from their rooms along the corridor at the far end of the car . In some miraculous way heat and wearinesshad vanished . They were fresh and fragrant as peppermint patties . Solemnly they sipped their highballs and scanned the list of . dinner dishes " Six dinners to haul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinky said . " So do n't let 's go hog-wild and order the works , it 'll take from here to breakfast to get it . " There was a gate  --  a little crossbarred iron gate  --  that stretched across their car platform and separated it from the other cars . It was not locked , it folded back on itself like an accordion . Their private porter , full of his own importance , closed it opened it as he went back and forth on his errands . Now and then a stray passenger would drift in past the folding gate , thinking this was a public lounge car , he would see six people seated there talking and drinking and laughing , he would sink into one of the luxu/rious seats and look about him with an air of relief and calm . Slowly an uncertain look would come into his face , then puzzlement , then embarrassment . No one said anything , the deferential colored porter did not approach these people . They vanished , red-faced . One man came in , boots , Stetson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face beamed with a smile of recognition . " Well , say , Bick , you old sonofagun ! Pinky ! Howdy , Pinky ! " " Hi ! " the men said . " Howdy , Mel ! " He rose , he came toward them , then a certain something seemed to strike him , an apprehensive look came into the frank blue eyes . Deliberately he stood . Those crinkled eyes that had stared so many years across the endless plain now slowly encompassedthe luxurious room on wheels , the strangely empty seats , the porter eying him with amused hostility from the far doorway ; the neatness , the lack of piled-up luggage . " Have a drink , Mel ? " Bick called to him . " How about supper with us ? Had your supper ? " " Well , say , " Mel stammered , blushing like a boy . " I did n't go for to stomp in on your party . Excuse me ! " He shook his head and raised his hand in a rather touching gesture of apology and farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little folding gate outside go clink and clank as it opened and closed . Leslie felt guilty and embarrassed but no one else seemed to attach any importance to the coming and going of Mel or his " fellow travelers . Pinky said , " Mel still got that little bitty place up to San Angelo ? About fifteen sections , ai n't it ? " " Thereabouts . Ten twelve thousand-acre piece , " Bick said . " Over-used his grass , and over-stocked . Going under , I 'd say . " Pinky disposed of him . " That 's the trouble with those little fellows . Feeders . They let the grassland run down and have to feed their young stock cake and then they wonder where the money goes . " " Cake ! " said Leslie , scenting a Texas joke . They laughed tolerantly , Bick laid a fond possessive hand onp296her knee . " Cake , Yankee , is feed  --  cottonseed cake . Concentrated cow feed and good and damned expensive . " " That 's right , " Pinky agreed virtuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of two million acres . " Abuse the rangeland and what 's happened to Texas the last half century ! Couple inches of topsoil lost from millions of acres , that 's what . Like to 've wrecked the state . " " Why do n't they make them put it back ? " Leslie inquired . A roar went up . Vashti Hake 's shrill defense came to her through the uproar . " Never you mind , Leslie . " She could laugh with them , but she persisted . " Well , but why ? " Thoughtfully Bick stared out of the window at the hundredsthousands  --  millions of acres of semi-arid land . " Because man has n't the trick of making earth  --  or maybe he just has n't got the time . To build back a couple of inches of topsoilin Texas would take nature from eight hundred to four thousand years . " Fascinated , Leslie persisted . " Then why does n't somebody teach them not to neglect the grassland in the first place ? " Vashti had been rummaging in a huge box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigors of the journey . She was eating a fondant-filled sweet and drinking a bourbon highball , a unique gustatory feat of which even Pinky disapproved . He offered mild protest . " Vash , chocolates and liquor do n't go together , they do n't set right . Anyway , all that supper 'll be along any minute . " Vashti ignored this epicurean counsel . Through a mouthful of creamy fondant and a sip of the highball she still sounded brisk and emphatic . " Teach hell ! They got no right to go ranching on a little bitty old piece you could n't run a goat on . They 'd do better go to work for folks know how to run a real ranch . Like Pa . Or Bick . Or even the Moreys though they only run two three hundred thousand acres since they got to be city folks . " " No ! " said Leslie , to her own surprise . " That is n't the way . That is n't a good way . "  |p297Vashti  hooted good-naturedly . " Is n't the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until twenty years later that Bob Dietz the agronomistspoke the words which Leslie now was too inexperienced to phrase . " Reata , " he said two decades later , " and the Hake ranch and all those overgrown giants are dated . A man who knows modern methods can make a success of four sections and not feed his stock a pound of hay or cake even in a drought season . But successor failure , a man who 's running his own ranch is a man . But on a place like Reata he 's a piece of machinery . And anyway , no man in a democracy should have the right to own millions of acres of land . That 's foolish old feudal stuff . " Now , falteringly , Leslie tried to express her own half-formed observations . " I just mean I think it 's better for a million men to own their own little farms than for one man to own a mil-lion " Heh , hold on there ! " Bick laughed . " You 're talking about the husband of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to watch out with that kind of talk , " Vashti said . " Every single thing you say is repeated all over Texas inside of twenty-four hours . " Leslie smiled politely . " Now Vashti . I 've been in Texas long enough to know you mean all over Reata . " " I mean all over Texas . " " Why ? " " Because you 're Mrs. Bick Benedict . And a Yankee . And different . And Texas is like that . Next thing you know they 'll be saying you 're one of those Socialists . " " Pooh , you 're just trying to scare me . I wo n't scare . " Bick leaned toward her , smiling , his eyes serious . " Texas , " he said , " is a village  --  of about three hundred thousand square miles . There 's more cattle in Texas than there are people . And Texas people are kind of lonesome people , they like a piece of news to chew on . You 're news . " " In Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls al/ways were considered slightly crazy , and even Virginia thinks we 're odd . But Papa brought us up to think for ourselves and say what we thought . " " He sure did ! " Bick said in full round tones . " Papa ! " Vashti yelled . " That 's funny . My pa raised me up too . " " Well , they do n't come any crazier than you do , Vash , " Pinky stated reasonably . " Of course Texas , " Leslie went on , " is really very conventional , so that anyone who varies from the " Conventional ! " shouted the Texans in chorus . Lew Morey , the mild-faced , raised a placating hand . " It 's too hot to be arguing whether Texas is conventional or not . " " I kind of know what she means , " Adarene Morey said . " I honestly do . But did n't you mean provincial instead of conventional , Leslie ? " " Never mind who means what , " Bick interrupted irritably . " People have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years and more . Let 's talk about something else , will you ! " Smoothly Lucius Morey poured a conversational oil slick . " I 'll bet anybody that in another ten years , the way the airplane business is booming since the war , you 'll be flying up to Holgado insidean hour , instead of having to eat and sleep on a long train trip this way . " Pinky took a thoughtful sip of bourbon . " I do n't know 's I 'd relish flying up to Holgado in all that mountain country . Too many hard clouds up around there , as the fellas used to say in the war . " Adarene Morey regarded her undramatic Lucius . " Lucius flew in the war , " she said to Leslie . " You would n't think it to look at him , but he was an ace . " " Why would n't you think it to look at me ! " her husband challengedher . " Mars kind of changed his face these last couple of wars . Used to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid just about managed to have his first shave. "  |p299Leslie  regarded the bland Morey with new interest . She was silent a moment . Then she swung her chair around away from the window view of the flat land skimming by in the early evening light . " You wo n't believe it ! I 've never asked Jordan what he was up to in the war . We 've all wanted to forget it , I suppose . Jordan , did you win the Battle of the Marne single-handed ? " Vashti spoke quickly . Even Luz could not have sprung more alertly to his defense . " Some had to stay home and raise beef cattle so the soldiers could eat . " Thoughtlessly Leslie said , " Old men can raise beef cattle . " Immediately she regretted it . " If it had n't of been for Texas , " Vashti went on , " we probably would n't even have won the war . " " Well , now , Vash , " Pinky drawled in mild remonstrance , " maybe that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got a medal was a Texan . " Leslie tried to cover the hurt . " I did n't mean  --  Jordan , I did n't mean " That 's all right , " Bick said stiffly . " My father was a sick man . I was twenty-two . He died just a little after . I guess he figured it might be better in the end to raise a few hundred thousand head of beef cattle to feed the world than for me to kill a couple of Germans . Maybe he was wrong . " " Practically he was right , " Leslie said quietly . " But for you he was wrong . " Now it was Adarene Morey who tried to guide the talk into impersonal paths . " Everything 's changed since the war . I do n't know . As if something was lost . Even old San Antonio is all changed . " " It 'll be just one big flying field , the whole town , the way they 're headed , " Pinky predicted morosely . " We thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now they 're starting in on this new Randolph Field , they say it 's going to set us back better than ten million dollars , just to lay it down . Keep on , pretty soon San Antonio ca n't see the sky for the wings . " p 300 " That 's all right , " Lew Morey said . " That 's just Texas making sure they ca n't ever start another World War on us . " " Who 'd be fool enough to start it ! " scoffed Bick . Clink-clank went the little iron gate . Quite a parade of starched white aprons and starched white coats and alert black faces beneath precarious trays . At the head of this procession , like a commanding officer , marched the dining-car steward ( white ) . Well , Mr. Benedict , it 's mighty nice to have you travelingwith us again . . . . Have n't seen you this way in a long time , Mr. Morey . . . . Miss Hake . . . uh . . . " I 'm Mrs. Mott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hope everything 's going to suit you all right I tended to it myself personally if you find anything wrong why just send word , why , thanks now if you folks going to want breakfast it might be a good idea give us your order now , well , coffee anyway , I alwayssay a cup of coffee first off and you can face anything . . . . It was not a gay meal . The little side tables had been hooked ingeniously into the wall , the couples sat two by two before the over-abundant food . Pitchers of cream , mounds of rolls , bowls of iced butter in the true tradition of North American waste . The repast finished , the six sat replete , somewhat uncomfortable , and silent . Even Vashti was strangely quiet . " We 're due in at daybreak , " Bick said . " Everything in Texas starts at daybreak , " Adarene Morey complained . " Pioneer stuff . " Leslie smiled at her across the aisle . Dear Adarene . Dear oasis . Bick stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Texas night . " I do n't know how the rest of you folks feel but I 'm all for letting the scenery go by until morning . " The Benedicts had the drawing room , the Moreys and the Snyths a compartment each . " Just roughing it , " Pinky grinned . " But anyway it 's better than on the ground like I 've done a milliontimes , with my saddle for a pillow . " Mumblemumble whisperwhisper ! They all knew better than to talk aloud in those connecting cubicles.  | " Jordan darling , I did n't mean it that way . I just remembered that we 'd never talked about the war , I suddenly thought Vashti expressed herself in whispers to Pinky . " Sometimes she says the meanest things and does n't mean them , that I ever heard spoken . " Lucius Morey ran an investigating thumb over his chin as he stared at his reflection in the mirror of the little bedroom . " She 'll be all right as soon as she gets the hang of Texas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sotto voce from the depths of her lower berth . " It 's just Bick that never will be really in love with anything but Reata . " Next morning at dawn Leslie saw in the distance something that broke at last the limitless horizon . There , blue against the golden plain , were the mountains . She felt a lift , a lightness in the air . And there at the little station was Uncle Bawley towering yet blending into the landscape like the mountains themselves . Leslie walked toward Uncle Bawley , she did not extend her hand to him she kept on walking and quite naturally walked into his arms and stayed there a moment with a feeling of having come home to someone she had known for a long long time . " Well , there 's something Holgado never saw before , " Bick said . " You better look alive , Bick ! " Pinky yelled . " Uncle Bawley 's going to cut you out ! " Bick grinned . " I 've seen history made . Uncle Bawley with his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so easy , " Uncle Bawley said ruefully , " I 'd of started earlier . " They piled into the waiting car , a glittering costly thing , elegantand sleek as Uncle Bawley 's boots , but even the women recognized it as a model of vintage make . Bick surveyed this conveyance , opulent and stuffy as a dowager in black satin . " You still pushing this ice wagon , Uncle Bawley ! " " I never drive the thing myself , I keep it for visiting royalty , like you folks . Nothing the matter with it , it sits there in the garage , the boys have to take it out and exercise it every week to keep it from going stale on me , like a horse . "  |p302Over  the roads at a fearsome Texas speed . The air seemed a visible opalescent shimmer , there was about it a heady coolness , dry and bracing as a martini . Leslie gazed about her . " I do n't wish to seem too annoying , but I am going to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of these she stopped and pointed dramatically as they sped along . " They 're real mountains ! " " What did you think they were ? Cream puffs ? " Bick said . " I mean they 're high . They 're really mountains . " Bick produced statistics . " Baldy 's over seven thousand feet . Sawtooth 's almost eight . That right , Uncle Bawley ? " " Seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight , " Uncle Bawley said . " Only reason I remember is I always wondered why the fella that measured it could n't have throwed in the extra two feet , made it an even eight . Sounds higher that way . But no , he had to go and be honest . " Seen from the road as they approached it from a far distance Holgado seemed a village in itself , a collection of adobe houses , whitewashed , squatting on the plain . But presently the main house took on dimensions , sprawling like the old Main House at Benedict in a series of rooms and patios . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the big living room whose waxed and shining tiles were strewn with Mexican rugs and the skins of mountain lions . Though here , as at Benedict , stuffed animal heads complete with horns manes fangs and ferocious eyes glared down from the walls upon the beholder , Leslie could regard them impersonally . They seemed to suit this house and region . They made a proper background for this giant in the canvas working clothes of a rancher . " You have some coffee on the train ? " Uncle Bawley asked . " Breakfast is ready any time you are . You folks probably want to go to your rooms first  --  you girls specially . " The thick-walled house was incredibly cool , no sunlight penetratedthe deep window embrasures . Neat white bedrooms opened off a neat white gallery ; neat white bathrooms , a haphazardp303Mexican chambermaid a precarious Mexican waitress , a neat black male cook in a very starched white apron and towering chef 's cap . " Well ! " Leslie exclaimed coming into the cool dining room and feeling strangely fresh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer Benedicts certainly rough it . What 's that heavenly smell ? " " Ham and eggs and biscuits and steak and fried potatoes is my guess , " Bick said , " if I know Uncle Bawley . And probably sausage and pancakes and maybe chicken . " " No , I mean an outside smell . I got it as I came along the veranda . A lovely scent , fresh and sweet . " " We had mountain showers , " Uncle Bawley said . " That 's the smell of wet greasewood and pinon and grass , it 's a nicer smell than any French perfume . " In came the steaming breakfast dishes in fantastic profusion , they were ranged on the long side table against the dining-room wall . " Oh , how lovely and lavish ! " Leslie said . " That 's the way we serve breakfast at home . " Vashti looked up from her plate . " You do ! For just you and Bick ! " " Oh . I meant at home in Virginia . " A little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Do you think it 's the altitude makes me feel so gay ? " " Let 's say it 's that and the company , " Bick suggested . " And maybe Uncle Bawley 's coffee , it 's notorious , they say a pound to a cup is his rule . " " No such thing , it only tastes like that because up here folks are already pepped up with the air , " Uncle Bawley said . " Down in the brush country you got to hop yourself up with coffee every few minutes to keep going . " " By now , Leslie , " Adarene Morey explained , " you 've probably noticed that West Texans look down on East Texans , and South Texans think nothing of the Panhandle crowd up north . Central Texas snoots the whole four corners , and the only time they allp304get together is when an outsider belittles the entire darned state . " " That 's right , " Pinky agreed . " Take like my maw , she used to pick on all us kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but let anybody outside say a word against any of us , why we were one and indivisible . " Blandly Lew Morey inquired , " Bawley , you 're going to show Leslie and the girls your house , are n't you ? " " You well know I ai n't . " " But is n't this your house ? " Leslie asked . " It 's my house . But I do n't live in it . I only visit here when I have company . " " But where . . . ? " Startled , she stared at him . He pointed past the veranda to an adobe house perched on a little rise a hundred feet back from the main house . A rather shabby old structure , its veranda slightly off plumb , its windows curtainless . " That 's the house I live in . " " Oh , Uncle Bawley , do let me see it . You must have wonderful things in it . " A shout went up . Bewildered , Leslie looked from one to the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , honey . I thought I 'd told you that no woman has ever set foot in Uncle Bawley 's house , even to clean it . " " Especially not to clean it , " Uncle Bawley corrected . " But I never saw a man who looked more spick-and-span than you , Uncle Bawley , " Leslie argued . " Only from head to foot . Not underfoot . " She looked at the old man , she marveled at the pain which old wounds could continue to inflict . It was more than five years later that Leslie finally saw this retreat in which old Bawley Benedict nursed his loneliness and unfulfillment ; this welter of newspapers , saddles , boots , saddle soap , pipes , gourds , trophies , pans , massive silver punch bowls , empty peach tins , time-stained copies of the Breeder 's Gazette . Five years later , when Jordy was four and Luz three a female entered this sanctum . Leslie had taken the two children up to Holgadop305for the cool air and the altitude . The three-year-old Luz was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there by cowboys , a calling and a searching before they came upon her . She had trotted off in the absence of her Mexican nurse , she had made her way up the little hill to Uncle Bawley 's house , and there they found her fluttering and rummaging ecstaticallyamongst the heaped-up scraps and piles of waste like a sparrow in the dust of the road . Now Leslie was never to forget these first ten days at Holgado . The clear lightness of the air exhilarated her after the humid heat of the Gulf coast country . The mountain showers seemed to bring up from the earth a sweet freshness , reticent but haunting . " It smells like white freesias , " Leslie said . " People are always making a fuss about honeysuckle and roses and magnolias . Freesias have the most exquisite scent of all . " " None of those around here , " Uncle Bawley said , " and I do n't know 's I 'm familiar with that brand of flower . But we 've got a blossom up here comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the sharp spikes of the plant , they can go into you like a stiletto . It 's too late now , they 've gone by , but the flower is white-petaled and mighty sweet . To my notion it 's about the prettiest flower there is anywhere . " He paused a moment . " If you can liken a person to a flower , why , I 'd say that 's the one you 're most like . " This compliment delighted her , she repeated it to Bick that first evening when , red-eyed and yawning , he came to their room where she already was sitting up in bed , reading . The house was bookless except for a shelf of technical volumes . These were ranged in the grim room that contained the big glass-doored gun cabinets . Shining and sinister in their racks , these slim blackbarreleditems of ranch household equipment did not appear anachronistic to anyone but Leslie . The books turned out to be gnawed-looking volumes on Spanishland grants in Texas . Intended as a baldly stated record of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unconsciously , a cloak-and-dagger account of such skullduggery ,  |p306adventure  , and acquisitive ruthlessness as to make the reader reject the whole as mythical . Settlers , pioneers , frontiersmen used cupidity against ignorance , turned land into cash and live men into dead men with blithe ferocity . Leslie devoured them , fascinated , horrified . " Jordan , what do you think ? Uncle Bawley is turning into a ladies ' man . He told me about the Spanish dagger flower and he said he thought it was the loveliest flower in the world . And then  --  pardon my pointing  --  he said I was like the flower . How 's that for a misogynist ! " " Uh-huh . He meant spikes and all , I suppose ? " Spiritedly she said , " I hope so . Who wants to be merely white and sweet , like a blanc mange ! " The first evening after the very good dinner , and on each succeeding evening , the four men gathered into the tightest of knots in one corner of the great living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity . Occasionally a word wafted itself over to the somewhat looser knot formed by the three semi-deserted women . Election . . . Commissioner . . . tax . . . district . . . oil . . . Congress . . . Gomez . . precinct . . . Vashti sometimes played a defeated game of solitaire through which she chattered unceasingly . " Jack on the queen ten on the jack I hope it 's a girl because they 're so cute to fix up with pink and hair ribbons where 's that nine for goodness ' sakes but a course Pa and Mott they 're yelling it 's got to be a boy whee there 's that of nine Adarene was doing a gros point chair tapestry , her basket of brilliant-hued wools made a gay splash of color in the firelighted room . After three evenings of this Leslie drifted casually across the room and sat down on the couch beside Bick . Conversation ceased . " Are n't you men being a bit too cozy ? " Bick 's left ear , she noticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch stuff , Leslie . Business . " " How fascinating ! I 'll listen . And learn a lot . "  |p307Lew  Morey leaned toward her , he patted her knee in a strangely paternal gesture for a man of his years . " Now now you do n't want to fret your head about such talk . " Suddenly she saw him clear . The bland almost expressionless face , unlined , quiet . There leaped into her mind a line she had read in a newspaper story about a frightfully rich oil man from the East . He had come to Oklahoma in the early oil days of that fantastic commonwealth , he had made his brisk millions , he had lost them almost as briskly . " They cleaned me , " he had said in the newspaper account . " The still-faced men . They got to me . " The still-faced men . Bland . Nerveless . Quietly genial . Lucius Morey . " We 're fixing it so that you girls can have all those doodads you 're always buying , " Pinky Snyth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a smile such as one would bestow upon an annoying and meddlesome brat . " All that stuff you 're getting for that new house of yours . How d' you think poor of Bick 's going to pay up for all that unless we figger out ! " The cow hand . The shrewd pink-cheeked curly-headed little gimlet . Turned cattle king . Leslie settled back as for a long stay . " How right you are ! I ought to know . Here I am , spending all that money without realizinghow Jordan has to plan and  --  and devise  --  to get it . So now you just go on talking and I 'll listen as quiet as a mouse  --  though I must say I think mice are awfully noisy , squeaking and scuttering around Bick 's voice was flat and hard . " This is n't only business . It 's politics . Men 's stuff . " " But darling , I was brought up on politics . You lads talk as if you had n't heard that women have the vote . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were in and out like whippets . And Jordan , you know our house was crammed with political talk and career men and striped trousers and national and international what not . Go on . Talk . I love it . " They were absolutely dumb . Uncle Bawley broke the silence . " My , that 's a pretty dress you 're wearing , Leslie . "  |p308In  disappointment she looked at him . " You too , Uncle Bawley ! " The gaze of the handsome old wreck of a giant met hers and to her amazement his faded blue eyes suddenly were deeply blue-black with the burning intensity of a young male in love . Leslie stood up . She was furious she was confused . " You men ought to be wearing leopard skins and carrying clubs and living in caves . You date back a hundred thousand years . Politics ! What 's so dirty about your politics that I ca n't hear it ! Gomez ! Jett Rink ! Gill Dace ! And all of you . Smiling and conniv-ing Bick Benedict rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not well " I am well ! I 'm well in body and I 'm well in mind . But mildew is going to set in . I can feel it . That slimy white sticky stuff that creeps into all the corners and closets down there unless you open the doors and windows and let the sun in . " Feeling rather triumphant though strangely shaky she walked across the room to where the two women sat like figures , she thought , in the fairy tale of the Sleeping Beauty . Vashti 's right hand was suspended in mid-air , a playing card held in her fingers . Her mouth was open , her eyes very round . Adarene 's needle was poised motionless above her embroidery frame . " Boo ! " said Leslie . Uncle Bawley called across the room . " What do you girls say we have a sunrise breakfast tomorrow , ride up into the hills ? And I 'll cook . " Vashti 's childlike squeal . " Ooh ! I 'd love it ! Let 's . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pinky said . " Or we wo n't be able to rout you out come daybreak . " Shrewishly Leslie called to him over her shoulder , " Yes , send the idiot children to bed so that you massive brains can talk in peace . " The men managed a tolerant laugh but Leslie hoped she detectedin it a touch of malaise . Adarene again began to ply her needle , in and out , in andp309out . She did not look up . " If you think anything you can say will make a dent in the tough hide of Texas . " " I 'd like to crack their skulls together like coconut shells . " " I 'm going to get me a snack before I go to bed , " Vashti said . Automatically Leslie rejected this . " After all that dinner ! " " I 'm eating for two . " Virtuously . " At least , " Adarene agreed . " Look , Leslie , just pay them no mind . It 's the elections coming up this autumn . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidel Gomez getting uppity they say , there are lots of important things to straighten out . I heard that Jett Rink was trying to make trouble with the ranch hands . " " What 's that got to do with elections ? " Adarene took three or four careful stitches , the big needle went through the coarse stiff web of the material , pop pop pop . " You 've never seen one of our elections , have you ? " " No . What about them ? " " Well , sometimes it gets sort of  --  uh  --  dramatic . The Mexican vote is pretty important . " " Is n't any vote important ? " " I suppose so . There are about four million whites in Texas . And about a million Mexicans . " " Whites . Mexicans . I never thought of Mexicans as  --  but if they vote they 're citizens , are n't they ? " " Yes . Yes , of course . But Vashti , slapping down the cards with the vehemence of one who is playing a losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . There ! There 's the deuce . . . . Come on now you ace . . . . Oh , damn ! " Scrabbling the unobliging cards together she looked up , defeated . " It 's real exciting at election . Regular old times , guns and all . They lock the gates and guard the fences , nobody can get out . " " Who ca n't ? " " Everybody . The Mexicans . The ranch hands . " " Vashti . Uh  --  look , Adarene . You two girls forget sometimes that I 'm new to Texas . I love to know about things . Now . Theyp310lock the gates so that people ca n't get out at election time . Why ? " In a tone of elaborate patience , as one would speak to a backwardchild , Vashti said , " So they 'll vote right of course , honey . So they wo n't go out and get mixed up with somebody 'll tell ' em wrong . This way they vote like they 're told to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Depends . Our place it 's Pa and two three behind him . And now Pinky too , of course . " " Of course . And at Reata , who ? " Adarene rolled up her embroidery , her voice cut this interrogation . " How about a three-handed game of bridge if those mean men wo n't talk to us or play ? " But Leslie leaned toward Vashti in utter concentration . " Who at Reata ? " " Oh goodness , I do n't know , I do n't pay much attention to men 's stuff like elections and so on . Luz , she used to be the real boss . She sure was the point when it came to rounding up the Mexicans . Then there was Jett Rink , of course , drunk as a sheep election time but that always made him tougher and they were scared of him . And then Fidel Gomez around Nopal and Benedict , all the Mexicans there . " Adarene Morey stood up . " Girls , I think I 'll go to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before dawn . How about you , Vashti ? " " I ai n't really sleepy . We slept so late this morning . Pinky never batted an eye till seven . I thought he was dead . It 's this mountain air and all , I guess . " " Listen a minute , Vashti . What offices do they vote for ? Local ? State ? National ? " " H 'm ? Oh . I do n't know , rightly . Do you , Adarene ? I do n't pay any attention . Commissioners , I guess . Anyway , for around here . Of course everybody is tied up with the ranches , miles and miles around . Why , they would n't be alive if it was n't for us , it 's their living , hauling cattle , working cattle , supplies and stuff and all that goes with it . I do n't know , do n't ask me , Pinky says I 'm a nitwit about stuff like that . Why n't you ask Bick ? Bick 'll explainp311to you all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't you , girls ? And a glass of milk and maybe some of that pie left over if there is any . Let 's raid the icebox , maybe the boys will too . " Leslie glanced toward the four men at the far end of the room . Their heads were close together , their voices low , their shoulders hunched . " No , I think I 'll take Adarene 's advice and go to bed . And read . " " You can take my movie magazine I bought in San Antonio , I 'm through with it . " Adarene laid a hand lightly on Leslie 's arm . " Stop looking like Lady Macbeth , honey . Take Texas the way Texas takes bourbon . Straight . It goes down easier . " " All I know is , " Vashti now was prattling on , " Mott says less'n ten years from now about six men 'll be running the whole of Texas . Gabe Target he says , and 011ie Whiteside if he gets Judge , and Lew and a course Bick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock Leslie , reading in bed , smelled the aroma of coffee , the state nightcap . The strong smell of the brew made her slightly queasy , she wished Bick would come in and open another window . She took deep grateful breaths of the cool sweet air . There was no sound . The men must be in the kitchen at the far end of the house . She resumed her reading of the naive volume on Spanish land grants . She must have dozed a bit for suddenly Bick was in the room , he was pulling off his boots with a little grunt . " Jordan ! I must have dropped off like a dozy old lady . It 's this heavenly air . " Bick Benedict did not reply . He regarded his bride with a hard and hostile eye . She looked very plain . Her habit of reading in bed through long night hours had made spectacles advisable and these were of the owlish horn-rimmed variety . The bare electric light bulb was glaring down on her face . As always , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwound tendrils of her hair so that now she presented a Medusa aspect . There was a small highlight of cold cream on one cheek . Finally , the slight cast that usually madep310more piquant the beauty of her eyes now was exaggerated under the strain of reading beneath the glaring white light . Harsh unspoken words formed in Bick Benedict 's mind as he went about the business of preparing for bed . So this was Leslie Lynnton the Virginia belle and beauty that he had split a gut to get . No Texas girl good enough , huh ? Oh no ! She now removed her glasses and regarded him thoughtfully , tapping her teeth with her spectacle bows . She had closed her book , one finger inserted to keep her place . He 's angry , she told herself , because I wanted to hear the talk . And I suppose I was n't very polite . That cave-man stuff . " This old book is fascinating , it 's about Spanish land grants . It says in those days they measured by varas . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . Mm . So you wo n't talk , eh ? She went on then , equably . " They cut a switch off a tree  --  about a yard long , it says  --  and that 's what they measured the land with . A vara 's length . A switch 's length . And then sometimes they measured by the wagon wheel , it says . They tied a red rag to a wheel spoke and walked behind the wagon and every time the red rag flashed round it was roughly fifteen feet . Is n't that sweet ! No wonder people could have million-acre ranches  --  I mean In his pajamas he was standing before the wall mirror running an investigating hand over his cheek . He regarded his own image intently . " Why , thanks , " he said . " Can you tell me more about Texas ? It 's all so fascinating . " " Sorry about my cave-man speech , darling . I 'll apologize tomorrow to the others , first thing . " " That 's big of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring at her in anger . His diction was pure Harvard and hard-bitten . " You certainly distinguished yourself this evening . " " Sh ! Jordan ! They can hear every word in every room along this veranda . " " That 's fine . And we heard every word you said in there too , tonight . Dirty politics ! And we date back a hundred thousandp313years ! Who the hell do you think you are ! Joan of Arc or some-thing ! " She held her breath as the words rang through the little stark white bedroom . They were holding their breath too , she thought , and hearing all this , there in those other little stark white bedroomsalong the gallery . " I said I 'm sorry about the name-calling . It was impolite . But in principle I was right . " " You come down here and try to tell us how to run the ranch ! And the town ! And the state ! I swear to God I think you 're crazy ! Insulting my friends . I 've stood it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm through with that . You 're my wife , you 're Mrs. Jordan Benedict . When the hell are you going to settle down and behave like everybody else ! " She got out of bed then and stood facing him , the book still in her hand , pressed against the laces at her breast . " Never . " They stood glaring at each other . Automatically his hand came up . He stared down at it . Dropped it to his side . " I almost hit you . " " I know . My darling . " " You 're running around in your bare feet . Cold . " " It does n't matter . " " Get back into bed . " Shivering she crept between the covers . He turned out the light . Silence in the little room , silence in all the little rooms , silence in the dark fragrant Texas night so full of turmoil and unrest and conflict . " Oh , Jordan , I wish we could live up here in the mountains . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reata . Could n't he ? Could n't he ? " " Get this . If you can understand anything that is n't Virginia and pink coats and hunt dinners and Washington tea parties . Just get this . I run Reata . I run Holgado . I run the damn wet Humedo Division and Los Gatos too and a lot you 've never heard of . Everything in them and on them is run by me . I run everything and everyone that has the Reata brand on it . " " Does that include me ? "  | " Dramatizing yourself , like a cheap movie . " Silence again . He spoke , his resentment hung almost a palpable thing in the darkness . " Tired . The hardest kind of day 's work does n't wear me down like ten minutes of this god-damned wrangling . I 'm not used to it . " " You 're not used to marriage . . . . Jordan , who was it said that thing about power ? " " Oh , Christ ! I do n't know who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He said " Papa Papa ! Forget Papa , will you ! " She lay very still , concentrating . The cool still fragrant mountainnight . Suddenly she sat bolt upright . Her low vibrant voice hung in the darkness . " Power corrupts . That 's it . I ca n't remember who said it . An English statesman I think . He said power corrupts . And absolute power corrupts absolutely . Jordan . " But he did not hear her . He was asleep.  |p315IT  WAS DARKER than night when the Mexican maid brought the morning coffee to their room . But all Holgado was astir . Hoofbeats . The deep reverberations of powerful motor vehicles , the sound intensified on the thin mountain air . The hiss and drum of Spanish spoken along the corridors . The tap-tap of men 's boot heels , the clink of spurs . The scampering feet of Mexican servitude  --  asound that Leslie found irksome . " They do n't walk . They run . On their heels . I should think it would shatter their gizzards . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  |p316Si  si senor . . . Momento senora . . . Las botas , si . . . Hace mucho frio . . . Bick emerged from the bathroom fully dressed . Tiptoeing . He peered toward her bed , the bathroom light behind him . " I 'm awake . " " Vashti 's complaining about the cold . " " It 's heaven . " Last night 's quarrel was cast aside like a soiled garment discardedin the fresh new day . " If we 're going to make that fool sunrise breakfast of Bawley 's . Even you girls ca n't make the sun wait while you dress . " She threw aside the covers , sat a moment hugging her shoulders . " I 'll be dressed in fifteen minutes . I must say I 'd like sunrisesjust as well if they could run them later in the morning . " " I do n't know  --  is this ride up the trail good for you now ? How about you girls taking a car instead ? We boys can get a head start riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your mother practically produced you on horseback . " " She was a Texan . " " Even for Texans the equipment is , I believe , standard . " He grinned . " See you later . I 'm going down to the corral . I 'll pick a gentled one for you . " She was still slim and almost boyish in her riding clothes . As she came along the veranda she could hear Uncle Bawley 's voice from the direction of the dining room , there was a sharp edge to his usual tone of almost caressing gentleness . " No , I do n't want any cook along , I 'm going to do the cooking myself . How about a couple dozen those Mexican quail , I 'll rig up an asador over the fire , they 'll make good breakfast eating , with bacon . " Vashti and Adarene were not yet down . It was still dark , the lights shone everywhere about the place . In her hand she carried the book on Spanish land grants , she had finished it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf in the gun room just off the patio . She opened the door , peered into the grim unlighted room , her hand groping for the electric switch . A sound , a littlep317quick startled sound . She hesitated . Waited . Silence . But there was a sense of presence there , of a something that held its breath and waited . Oh , pooh , a mouse . Her fingers found the light , flicked it on . A boy , dark ragged shaking , was flattened against the whitewashedwall , the palms of his hands were spread against it like one crucified , the emaciated body was trying to press into the wall itself . The black eyes , fixed in a frantic stare , became imploring as the eyelids relaxed a trifle and a caught breath lifted the rags on his breast . Before she darted out and shut the door , before she lifted her voice to call , in that split second her inner voice said , That was Fear you just saw that was n't flesh and blood that was blind naked Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a note of hysteria in her voice . " Uncle Bawley ! Uncle Bawley ! Uncle Bawley ! " He was there with incredible swiftness , speeded by the urgency in her voice , towering above her , his hands on her shoulders . " What 's wrong ! Leslie ! " " In there . There 's a  --  there 's somebody hiding in there . " He flung open the gun-room door . The boy was on the floor , a heap on the floor like a mop like a rag . Speaking in Spanish Uncle Bawley said , " Get up ! " The boy did not move . Uncle Bawley picked him up as you would a wet dog , gingerly , by the neck and shoulders and half carried half dragged him along the floor to the patio . " No , " Leslie whispered . " No . Do n't " It 's all right . Happens every day . " Uncle Bawley looked enormous above the little heap of rags on the floor . " Nobody 's going to hurt him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wetback . Swum or waded the river between Mexico and here , must have walked a hundred miles and more . " Foolishly she stammered , " What river ? " " Now Leslie ! Rio Grande of course . They do it all the time . " Now he leaned over the boy , he spoke to him in Spanish , Leslie caught a word here and there . In Uncle Bawley 's voice therep318was something that caused the bundle of rags to raise its head . Leslie 's Spanish lessons bore fruit now . A familiar Spanish word , the inflection of Uncle Bawley 's voice , her own instinct combinedto give her the sense of what was being said . Come come , boy , stand up ! You have waded the Rio Grande you have walked the long miles , that takes the courage of a man . Do n't crouch there then like a dog . No one will hurt you . Stand up ! You are a man ! He stirred the bundle with the toe of his shining boot . The rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was a mask of abject terror and glimmering hope mingled . Seventeen , perhaps . A skeleton . " How long have you been in there ? " " This morning only . I walked all night and the night before and the night before and before . By day I lay where I could , hiding . " " Food ? " The shoulders came up , the bony hands spread . " Have you seen Immigration Officers or Rangers these past nights ? " " Once men passed near me as I lay in a ditch . I prayed I pressed deep into the ground I pushed myself into the desert I was the desert I prayed to the Miraculous Christ and to the Senor de Chalma and to the Virgin of Guadalupe and they heard and my prayers were answered . " " I bet , " said Uncle Bawley . The boy was still talking , a stream of words poured out in relief and hysteria and hope . " Tell me , " Leslie said . " I only catch a word here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time I tell you . About fifty sixty thousand of these wetbacks slip out of Mexico every year , swim or wade the Rio Grande where it 's shallow , travel by night and hole up by day . The Border Patrol and the Immigrationboys and Rangers and all , they ca n't keep all of them out . Sometimes they make it , a lot of ' em are caught and thrown back . Sometimes they 're shot by mistake , sometimes they wander around and starve . This skin-and-bones says he 's been eating rats . "  | " No ! " She was stiff with horror . " But he ought 've come in with the regular Mexican labor lot . Thousands of them brought across legally here to Texas . Pick the cotton and the crops , fruit and vegetables in the Valley , and so on . He says he tried to make it , they were full up . " " I 'm going to call Jordan . " Instantly Uncle Bawley raised his hand . " Nope . Jordan 's against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " He would n't ! " Uncle Bawley glanced over his shoulder . " If Bick comes along now and sees the boy he 'll turn him in . He 's set against it I tell you . " She stared at him . " If I do n't call Jordan what will you do ? " " Feed him give him some decent rags turn him loose tonight . " She stared now at the boy , the black eyes were fixed on her , they shifted then to the great booted towering figure . " Do that , " she said . " Do that . " Her lips felt stiff . Uncle Bawley turned to the boy . He spoke again in Spanish , he pointed to his own shabby house on the hillock behind the main ranch house . " Has anyone else seen you ? " The boy shook his head . " That house . Run there now . No . Wait . I 'll take you . " Leslie stood in the patio . She watched the two quickly ascend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadowy figure , screening him . She stood there , waiting , peering into the dark . She was there , outlined against the patio light , when Uncle Bawley emerged and joined her . " What you getting upset about , Leslie ? Immigration fellas come along looking for hide-outs the way they sometimes do , why , they would n't dast go near my house up there , they well know nobody 's allowed , I 'd take their jobs away from them if they did . " She was completely bewildered . She thought , What a statement ! " I 'm so mixed up , " she stammered . " What you so upset about , Leslie ? " In that soft strangely musical voice . " He 's mostly Mexican Indian , that boy , he 's used to traveling hundreds of miles afoot . " A tiny door in a corner ofp320her memory opened and a handful of words flashed out . Walk ! You ca n't walk . Nobody walks in Texas , only the Mexicans . " Anyway , " Uncle Bawley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , sleep in a corner all day up there , I 'll fetch him up coffee now and a lot of good grub , give him pants and a shirt and shoes  --  he 'll sell the shoes first off " How do you know Jordan would have turned him back ! I do n't believe it . He is n't like that . In the Valley . . . I saw . . . there 's a horrid man called Gomez . . . " He came to her , his great hand on her shoulder , he looked down at her . " Now now Leslie girl , nothing to go to bawling about , just another Mexican Indian coming back to Tejas , you might almost say . It 's only that Bick 's made a rule against it here at Holgado , so near the border , and all over Reata . And he 's right . Texas ca n't take in all of Mexico 's misfits . It 's illegal , it makes big trouble . If they come in with the seasonal labor migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haul ' em in , pay ' em a couple of dollars , haul ' em back , well and good . But a kid crawls in , starving like that one , I pay Bick no mind . Only let 's keep this just between us , you and me. fm ? " " Yes , Uncle Bawley . I wish I could get it all straight in my mind . They use them . Cheap . And then throw them back , like old rags . A century of it but it 's never really worked out right , has it ? " Evasively , " Where 's the rest of the boys and girls , I wonder , have n't heard a peep out of the Moreys or the " His voice trailed off . He faced Leslie squarely . " Strictly speaking  --  which hardly anybody does  --  why , what with picking the cotton and the fruit and now the Valley is all planted with vegetables , a big new industry , and the old railroad building days and all , why you might say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that one . On the bent backs of Mexicans . Do n't let on to Bick I said that . " Through her tears she looked up at him and the blur wiped the lines from the face , the little sag from the shoulders . With a gesture utterly unpremeditated , wanton , overpowering , she threwp321her arms about his neck she brought the fine old head down to hers , she kissed him full on the lips , long hard lasting . Horrified . " Forgive me . What is the matter with me ! Uncle Bawley ! " He stood a moment , his arms hanging at his sides . " My , that was nice , " he said quietly . " But you ever get a notion to do that again , Leslie , I 'll turn you over my knee and spank you good . Hear me . " " Yes , Uncle Bawley . " Vashti 's voice high and shrill from the direction of the guest rooms . " Adarene ! Leslie ! Where 's everybody got to ! " Uncle Bawley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm coming . We overslept . " Pinky skipping along the gallery toward the patio . " Now Vash , do n't you go to eating before breakfast . " " Why do n't we get going , then ! I 'm starved . " " All right . Cup of coffee . " Fifteen minutes later they clattered out in the cool scented darkness , Bick keeping close to Leslie . Adarene sat very straight in the saddle . " Rides like a Yankee , " Lucius Morey commented . " Adarene never got over that school she went to , up the Hudson . " Vashti , an imposing mound of flesh looming ahead in the first faint dawn , rode cowboy fashion , one vast hip slipped to the side , one arm hanging loose or waving in the air , she kept up with the men and greeted the dawn like a Comanche on the warpath . The hills loomed grey then brown then rose then burst into scarlet . The plains , green and gold , ran to meet them . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The light , the curious light . Not like anything in America . It 's Egypt  --  with the Alps thrown in . " " Egypt and Alps hell ! It 's Texas . " A streak of gold-beige , like a flash of smoky sunlight , shot across the nearby brush and vanished behind a hillock . " Antelope , " said Bick . He was riding at Leslie 's left , Uncle Bawley was at her right.  | " Uncle Bawley , you told me that there are more cattle than people in Texas , " Leslie said . " But I never see any . Look . Miles and miles and miles , but not a four-footed thing . " " They like the brush , " Uncle Bawley explained . " And the quiet places away from the roads and highways . Maybe the old wild Longhorn strain ai n't all bred out of them . Like me . " " And cowboys . Where do you keep them ? I saw more cowboys in the movies at home . Those strong silent handsome males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Lacey writes and asks me " Strong silent clabbermouths ! Cow hands talk all the time , they 're lonely people , they 'll talk to anybody . If they ca n't talk they sing to themselves or to the cows . " " Movies ! " scoffed Bick . " Movies and those rodeos at Madison Square Garden and around , they give people the impression that a cow hand goes out and throws a steer every morning before breakfast , just for exercise . It 's a technique , like any other profession , you have to have a gift for it , you have to spend years learning it , it 's something you have to have handed down from father to son . I did , and my father did , and my son 's going to . " " That 's right , " said Uncle Bawley . " They write to Bick all the time , and they write to me and the big ranches around , college kids that want to be cowboys . They say they can ride a horse , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they ride in Central Park in New York , they say they want to learn to be cowboys . Well , say , I would n't have them free , they ai n't worth picking up off the ground after the horse has threw them . " Suddenly , " Look , Leslie , " Bick said , and pointed to a smallherd gloomily regarding the riders from the range fence . rLeslie stared at the animals , they returned her stare glumly , hunched near the fence , their shaggy heads and bald faces , their humped backs and short-haired hides giving them the aspect of monsters in a nightmare . " What are they ! They 're frightening ! " " Now , Bick , do n't you go making me out a fool , front of Leslie . "  |p323Bick  was laughing , and the riders ahead were pointing and grinning back at Uncle Bawley . " They 're called cattlo . Tell her , Bawley . " Ruefully Uncle Bawley eyed the weird creatures so mournfullyreturning his gaze as the little cavalcade rode by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word made up out of cattle and buffalo and that 's what those critters are , they 're bred up out of cattle and buffalo , bred years back to see if we could n't fetch something the heat and the ticks would n't get to . " " You got something sure enough , " Bick grinned . " I do n't know 's they 're much meaner-looking than those crittersyou 're talking so big about , Herefords bred to those old humpy sloe-eyed beasts you 're always yapping about . Kashmirs ! And Brahmans . Camels with an underslung chassis , that 's what they are . Cows with humps on their backs . It ai n't in nature ! " But Bick laughed as he rode along . " Just you wait , Bawley , you 're going to see a breed that 'll make cattle history before Gill Dace and I finish with them . " Pinky turned in his saddle to shout back to them . " I never heard so much talking a-horseback in my whole life . Who ever heard of talking riding ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I have to talk to them riding because it 's the only time they ever sit down . " " I 'll go along ahead , " Uncle Bawley said , " get a fire going and the skillet on . " He was off with a clatter and a whoosh . The other horses tried to follow but the big man on the powerful horse outdistanced them . " That horse of Bawley 's , " Bick explained , as he eyed Leslie with some concern after their spurt of sudden speed , " is the fastest thing in Jeff Davis County and maybe in Texas . For riding , that is . And look at the build of him ! A regular galon for size . " " He 'd have to be huge to carry around that mountain of a man . Uh , sorry , dear , but I feel a question coming on . Galon ? What 's a galon ? " As they jogged along with the rose of sunrise reflected in their faces , " Well , let 's see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big horse a galon , it 's a horse they used to have for hauling , not for riding . Before machinery did the work . They say that in the war for Texas Independence the Mexicans would hear the American teamsters yelling at those big square puddingfootedhorses going through the Texas sand and mud and clay , hauling the heavy stuff of war . The teamsters would yell to the horses , G'long ! G'long ! ' Get along , get along , see ? So the Mexicans thought a heavy horse was a galon . " " True ? " " True enough . Anyway , it 's fun telling you tall Texas tales . You always look like a little girl who 's hearing Cinderella for the first time . " " Antelopes and galons and cattlos and sunrise and quail for breakfast " And me . " " And you . " " And Vashti . " " Jordan , we 're quite near the Mexican border , are n't we ? " " Not far . " " If we were to meet a wetback now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " Dear little Yankee , do you think wetbacks go dripping along the road in daylight carrying a printed sign that says I Am a Wetback ? " " No , but if you did see one , there in the ditch , hiding . What would you do ? Would you pass him by , would you help him , would you turn him in ? " " You know what happens to little girls who play with matches , do n't you ? They get burned . " " Oh , Jordan , I 'm just trying to get things straight in my mind . It 's all so new to me and some of it 's fascinating and some of it 's horrible . Labor , almost like slaves , but that 's legal . Wetbacks , but that is n't legal . You all use the Mexican vote in Benedict and the whole county " Uh-huh . Like your Negro vote in the South . " " Yes , but that does n't make it right . "  | " Honey , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have married any nice comfortable Texas girl and damned well let you wrestle with Red Coat and his dandy little Principality . I 'll bet you 'd have had a fine time straightening out the Labor Situation in the Schleppenhausen or wherever it is he rules . . . . Come on , they 're all miles ahead of us . Let 's really ride before they send back a search party for us . " Clattering down the main road , then off on a dirt side road and up the narrow trail with the smoke of Uncle Bawley 's fire pointing the way and the scent of Uncle Bawley 's coffee and quail and bacon . He was squatting Mexican fashion in front of the fire of mesquite , the plump quail were roasting on an improvised spit and the bacon was slowly sizzling in the pan . The others already were sipping burning-hot black coffee as they stood about the fire . " Mm , smells divine ! " Leslie said . " Let me warn you , Yankee , " Bick said . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf balls . " " Let me help , Uncle Bawley , " Leslie offered . " I 'll baste them . That 'll make them tender . " " He 'll never let you , " Vashti said . " Uncle Bawley is a real batch , he likes to do things his own way . Texas way . " " No different from anybody else , " Uncle Bawley argued . " Cooking over an open fire is cooking over an open fire , no matter where . " He was lifting the crisp strips of dripping bacon out of the pan as they curled and sizzled , he looked about him for an absorbent receptacle on which to place them to drain until the quail should be golden brown . His wandering gaze  --  the eye of the practiced rancher and camper  --  fell on a nearby clop of old sun-dried cow dung ; porous , dehydrated as a sponge or a blotter . Delicately , methodically , he placed the first strip of bacon , and the second and third , on top of this natural draining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Bawley repeated . " Texans are n't , only maybe some little ways . " Leslie began to laugh , peal after peal , helplessly . The others stared at her , surprised , vaguely resentful but scrupulously polite.  |p327THE  BOY was named Jordan . Jordan Benedict Fourth . Like royalty . Leslie had objected to no avail . It became Jordy for short in order not to confuse him with his father , Jordan Third . " Yes , I know there 's been a Jordan in the family for a century . Jordan First Second Third and now Fourth . But remember what happened to all those dynasty boys ? Those Ptolemys and the Louis lads and the Charleses ? " " What would you call him ? " " David . " " David ! What David ? "  | " The boy with the slingshot . The one who killed the giant Goliath . " " That 's a nice bloodthirsty idea . " Bick Benedict 's happiness was touching to see . " But he 's no Benedict , " Bick said , regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . I 've been canceled out of the whole transaction . " " You 're just disappointed because he did n't turn out to be that perfect Hereford-Kashmir bull calf you 've been trying to produce . " A month later Vashti Hake Snyth presented Pinky with twin daughters . Mercifully , old Cliff Hake had died just before the birth of the twins . The mammoth matron made no secret of her disappointment . " In a way I 'm glad Pa went before the twins came . He was mad enough when I was born . They say he would n't speak to Ma for a month after . He 'd prolly have disinheritedme , seeing these , or shot Mott for a Texas traitor . " She named the plump girl babies Yula Belle and Lula Belle . As they grew in length and width and attained young girlhood they were fated to be known to the undazzled swains for five hundred miles in every direction as the Cow Belles . Vashti 's plan for at least one of these stolid morsels was confidedwith her usual subtlety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry one of ' em , stands to reason . No crawling out of it this time , with two of them waiting . " " Both or nothing , " Bick said . To Bick Leslie said , not altogether humorously , " Vashti as my Jordy 's mother-in-law ! I 'd send him to Tibet , rather , and have him brought up a lama in a lamasery . " " Do n't you worry . Jordan Benedict Fourth is going to be a tough Texas cowman . Nobody 'll have to tell him where to head in . He 'll take care of himself . " Jordy Benedict was scarcely a month old when his father gave him his first reata , his boots , his Stetson his saddle , all initialed all stamped with the Reata Ranch brand . As he outgrew the tiny boots expressly made for him fresh ones were ordered , exquisitelyp329soft bits of leather fashioned by the hands of the craftsman Ildefonso Mezo . When the boy was two years old Ildefonso had taken the baby foot in his brown sensitive hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of a century of booted Benedicts . Hesitantly , frowning a little , the boy 's small foot in his palm , he looked up at Bick Benedict . " Plana . " He ran a finger over the instep . " Flat . This is more the foot of a dancer . " " Dancer ! " yelled Bick . " This is not the foot of a jinete . It is not a foot for the stirrup . " " It damned well will be . " At three , arrayed in full cowboy regalia , the boy had been lifted to the horse 's back . Bick himself had set him there , had placed the reins in the baby fingers , had remained alongside , mounted on his own horse while Leslie stood by tense with fear . The child had sat a moment in frozen silence , his eyes wide , his mouth an open oval of terror . Suddenly he broke , he began to slip off the saddle , he screamed to be taken down . Down ! Down ! Bick was disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's only a baby , " Leslie said , her arms about the screaming child . " When I was his age I yelled to be put on a horse , not taken off . If they did n't put me on I began to climb up his legs or tail or something . Ask anybody . Ask Polo . " " All right , that was very cute , but that was you . This is another person . Maybe he just does n't like horses . Maybe he does n't like riding . Maybe he 's a walker like his mother . " " He 's a Benedict and I 'm going to make a horseman out of him if I have to tie him to do it . " " You 've been playing God so long you think you run the world . " " I run the part of it that 's mine . " " He 's not yours . He 's yours and mine . And not even ours . He 's himself . Suppose he does n't like sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to do I wo n't care if he ca n't tell a horse from a cow . There are important things inp330the world outside Reata . Outside Benedict . Even outside Texas ! " " Not to me . " " I think you actually mean that . " " Damn right I do . " But this came later . Just now the boy was seven months old . Leslie longed to have her father see him ; to show him to her mother and her friends . She began to plan a Virginia visit . " It 's been almost a year and a half . I can hardly believe it . Jordy 'll be all grown up before they see him . " " Why do n't they all come here for a visit ? " Bick suggested . " I wrote them . But Papa ca n't get away just now . Lacey 's gota beau who is n't safe to leave she says . Mama alone . . . ? " " You 're right . " Hastily . " I feel so  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite and this morning " She stopped , struck by a sudden shattering suspicion . Doctor Tom had made the suspicion a reality . " No ! " Leslie , appalled , had rejected the diagnosis . " I ca n't ! Jordy 's only seven months old ! " " Everything grows fast in Texas . " " I wo n't ! There 'll be only  --  let 's see  --  nine  --  sixteen months between them . I wo n't ! " " You 're a healthy young woman . It 'll be all right , Leslie . If this one 's a girl you 'll have a nice start toward a real family , all in about two years . " Doctor Tom regarded her with keen kind eyes . " It 's better this way . Something  --  two somethings  --  real and important to tie you to Texas . " Bick had been startled , then hilarious and definitely pleased with himself . " I 'll consent to a girl this time , just to show you I 'm no pasha . " Half laughing half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brides . I have n't even had a chance to wear my trousseau dresses . They 'll be museum pieces . " " Give them to the Mexican girls around the house . " " Mama would sue . " A terrible thought struck her . " Now I ca n't go home . "  | " Next year then , honey . In triumph . With two babies . Do n't forget to show them to that duke or whatever he was , in the pink coat . I 'll bet he could n't have - " " Oh , I would n't be so sure . He seemed to me quite a talented young man . " She felt irritable , restless , trapped . " I wish I could dress up and sit at a restaurant table and hear some music . And even dance , perhaps . I look awful . My skin is like a crocodile 's . I hear that dresses are longer and waistlines shorter and the boyish bob is out . I feel like a squaw . " " I ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel up to it . Tell you what , let 's run down to Viento and stay at the Hake for a couple of days . " " Hake . If it 's anything like " It 's quite a hotel . Music and the Seville Room and hostesses and a gold-and-marble lobby , all new . Did n't I ever tell you about the Hake ? Besides , this is Fiesta week down there . " " Crowded . " " We 'll be all right . We keep a big suite at the Hake the year round . It 's quite a story . Old Cliff Hake built the hotel to spite the Jaggers outfit at the old Lone Star House . He was staying at the Lone Star and he got good and boiled one night and thought he was back in the old days fifty years ago . He ran out of his own liquor and forgot all about Texas being dry , began shooting up the Coffee Shoppe , poor old maverick , and then he shot his way into the lobby , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jordan , you 're making this up ! " " Ask Vashti . Ask anybody . After that they would n't give him a room at the Lone Star . Old Cliff was so mad he said he 'd build a new modern hotel that would put the old Lone Star out of business and he sure did . The night of the opening he and Vashti led the grand march in the ballroom , you had to dress in Spanish costume , the invitations said Frontier Fiesta , Cliff was drunk as an owl and Vashti was n't exactly cold sober . Well , guests began playing hide-and-seek behind those new marble pillars in the lobby , dodging bullets . "  | " Poor little man , " said Leslie . " Living in a day that is gone . " Bick stared . " I would n't put it exactly that way . Cliff was modern as the next one . " The Vientecito trip was quite a success . Leslie was amazed at the natural beauty of the thriving little city , perched as it was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . " It 's dazzling ! " she exclaimed as she and Bick drove along the miles of waterfront . " In any other country in the world it would be a Riviera , with casinos and beaches and restaurants and all that dreadful stuff . Miles and miles and miles of waterfront ! Jordan , let 's get out and walk . Really walk . " " Walk ! What for ? " " What does anybody walk for ! " " I never could figure out . " The long promenade was strangely deserted , even the Fiesta crowds only drove briskly by , staring at the brilliant expanse of rolling waters as at some strange and unapproachable phenomenon of nature . Boats bobbed at the piers , sails glinted against the horizon . The man and woman walked alone , two figures against the background of sky and water , no other living thing moved except the swooping gulls and an occasional Mexican fisherman sitting hunched over his crude pole at the edge of the breakwater . The wind blew , it whipped you along if you went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was none of the exhilaratingsalty tang of ocean air . Leslie drew in a few experimental deep breaths . Nothing happened . " Had enough ? " Bick asked . " Why does n't it make me feel terrific ? " " Uh -- how would you like to go put in one of the boats ? I always keep a boat here and so does Roady . And there 's the speed boat too , if you want to hit it up . " " Boat . Oh , I think boats are n't the thing for me just now The bright thriving city was in gala dress . Plump matrons in fringed silk shawls and high combs and mantillas , mahogany giants in costumes that were an impartial mixture of late Texasp333Mexican music ; Miss Charlene " Cookie " Tacker , voted Queen of this year 's Fiesta , held royal court atop a vast moving platform transformed for the occasion from its prosaic everyday aspect as Baumer 's Trucking and Hauling vehicle . Men and women in satins and sombreros astride creamy palominos . The horses , glintingin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fairy tale . Skittish quarter horses prancing and sidling . False ferocious mustaches and beards , grandees in goatees . " You all right , Leslie ? " " I 'm wonderful . " " You do n't want to get all tired out . Maybe you 'd better go in and rest for a while . Lie down . This 'll be going on for hours . " " I love it . After it 's finished  --  later  --  let 's go down in the lobby . I want to look at all the people . " " An awful jam down there . We 'd better have dinner served up here . " " Oh , no ! No ! I want to have it in the restaurant . It 's  --  it 's kind of stimulating to be in a crowd again . People , lots and lots of people . " " Pretty rough down there . . . . All right all right . I 'll reserve a table . I hope . But it 's late . " " Never too late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The parade the music the clamor the crowds streamed and blared and shouted on and on in the street below . At last , baffled , Leslie asked her question . " But where are the Mexicans ? It 's all about Spain and Mexico and old Texas . Where are they ? All theand early buccaneer thronged the streets , the Hake lobby . Mexicanfood was dispensed at street corners , signs worded in Spanish proclaimed this attraction or that , there was a gigantic parade which Bick and Leslie and an assortment of unexpected guests ( true to the state custom ) watched from the windows of the big Benedict suite . Float after float rumbled past , bunting-draped flower-festooned ; Spanish costumes , Mexican costumes ; charro costumes , vaquero costumes , senoritas , ruffled long-skirted dancers , grandees , pirates , conquistadores , toreros , Spanish music ,  |p334|peo|ple  in the parade and even on the streets are what you call-well -- Anglo . " " Uh oh , they have a celebration of their own another day  --  a real Mexican Fiesta over in the Mexican part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vientecito ? " " Well , sure . " " I suppose Coronado and all those conquistadores you 're always naming everything after were one hundred percent white Protestant Americans . " " You going to start all that again ? Come on now , this is Fiesta , Yankee . No fair crabbing . " The hotel lobby fascinated her . Vast , marble-columned , it was , architecturally , a blend of Roman bath and Byzantine bordello . Gigantic men in boots and ten-gallon hats lolled in the stupendous leather chairs amongst the mottled marble and the potted palms . The Mexican bellboys , slim and elegant in their tight uniforms , agile as eels , were in startling contrast with the monolithic men whose bags they carried , whose errands they ran . Clearing a path ahead of her , battling his way through the lobby mob . . . Hi , Bick ! . . . Bick , you old maverick , where you been all these . . . Howdy , Bick ! Say , I 'd like for you to meet my wife she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this stampede ! . . . A corner in a far end of the room near a pillar and beneath a gigantic palm . The assistant manager magically produced a chair . Here you are , Mrs. Benedict , right in the middle of the roundup . You want to look out , Bick , she do n't get tromped the way they 're milling around today . Bick was puzzled . " It does n't seem like you , Leslie , wanting to get into the middle of a mob like this . " " I know . I suppose I 'm hungry for people . Crowds of people . Once in a while it 's sort of exhilarating . " " Will you be all right here for a minute ? I 'll just butter up those people in the dining room so we 'll have a decent table . The Beezers are here , they 're going to eat with us , and the Caldwellsp335and Jim and Mamie Hatton  --  you met the Hattons , remember ? At Len 's ? " " Yes , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She enjoyed it . She seemed to draw in through her skin and her senses a kind of vitality from the sheer strength and high spirits that flowed from these sun-soaked beef-fed people . Quietly she sat in her corner in her pretty trousseau dress , a bit snug for her now , and watched the surge and flow of these pseudo-Spanish and mock-Mexican Texans in their Fiesta finery . " Howdy , Miz Benedict . " Jett Rink in his good Stetson and his good handmade boots and his clean canvas clothes . " Jett ! " " Yes ma'am . I watched for you to come down . I knew you had to , sometime . I heard you was here . And I was across the street watching the parade , I seen you  --  saw you at the window . " Seen you saw you . The schoolteacher wife . " How are you , Jett ? " " Good . " " And your wife ? I hear you married Miss Dart , the school-teacher . " " Not now we ai n't . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the dining-room doorway . Jordan would be furious if he found her talking to this boy . She turned her head away . But he stood there before her , staring at her . " I 'm running a rig now . Ai n't you heard ? I 'm the works , driller and tool dresser and grease monkey all rolled in one . " " Grease monkey ? " She could n't resist the question . " On the oil rig . We 're drilling on my own piece , me and my uncle and little brother . Starting to , that is . " She rose . " That 's splendid . Good-bye . " " Huh ? " He glanced over his shoulder . " Say , I know Bick 's got his kettle on for me , I ai n't aiming to meet up with him  --  vet . " He turned his hard relentless gaze upon her , those hot narrow eyes set so close together bored into her eyes . They traveled slowly down her face to her mouth and rested there a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I been wanting to see you , " he said , almost humbly . She brushed past him , she began to push her way through the throng . " I 'll be seeing you again , " Jett Rink said . It was not a casual farewell . It was a threat . The crowd closed in on her . She was elbowed this way and that . A hand gripped her arm . " Leslie ! I told you to stay till I came back for you . " Jordan 's dear face full of concern for her . " I did n't like it there . Hot . " " The folks are waiting for us . Let 's have dinner early , before the big mob . " The Seville Room maitre d'hotel turned out to be a headwaitress , brightly blonde and dressed as Carmen . Her kind carewornface beamed a genuine welcome . " Hiyah ! Right this way , honey . " In the same breath she speeded a parting guest . " Come back quick ! " Her flounced skirts bobbed energetically as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Beezers and the Hattons and the Caldwells , brimming with friendship and warm hospitality . The men had brown paper parcels under their arms , and these they now somewhat sheepishly brought forth as bottles . Carmen hovered solicitously , she beckoned and a Mexican bus boy brought ice and glasses and water . " Where at 's your castanets , Carrie ? " Ed Beezer inquired . " Never you mind , " Carmen retorted inadequately , her anxious eye on the doorway even as she bent over their table . " Pay him no mind , Carrie , " Joella Beezer said kindly . " How 's your little girl ? " Carmen momentarily forgot the doorway guests . " Little ! Say , you ought to see her ! Taller than me , she 's singing in the choir of the First Baptist now , and taking vocal . " " Well , you got a right to be real proud ! " Bick looked at Leslie . " Well , you asked for it . " His hand sought hers . " I love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you . " Carmen , guileless as milk , bustled off to greet the Fiesta diners that now thronged the doorway . Her voice rang above the blarep337of the big band on the platform at the far end of the room . " Hiyah ! Howdy ! Sure nice to see you . Right this way , honey ! " Well , Mexican food is the thing tonight , sure enough , they decided . Not as good here as it is in a real Mexican joint , but good enough . What d' you say we start with enchiladas ? . . . Heartburn . " I think a steak for Leslie here , " Bick said . " Steak all right , Leslie ? " " Fine , " Leslie said . " Perfect . " The band broke into the measured beat of a tango . Gourds chattered , drums pounded . The little dancing floor in the center of the dining room suddenly was asquirm with posturing figures in mantillas and silks and boleros . Handsome Texas males . Blooming Texas matrons . Dazzlingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aroma of coffee , the smell of hot spicy food . No dark faces other than those of the Mexican bus boys moving silently from table to table . Ed Beezer challenged Leslie 's wide-eyed interest in the colorful clamorous room . " I bet you never saw anything like this up North , Miz Benedict . You 'd never believe you were in the United States , would you ? " " Never , " Leslie said . " Never . "  |p338EVEN  BICK CONCEDED that the girl , from the moment of her birth , was completely a Benedict . She was fair as her brother Jordy was dark , sunny as he was somber . " Well , that 's more like it ! " Bick exulted . " Too bad we ca n't switch them around , but anyway now we 're really coming through with the strain . " With a cautious caressing forefinger he traced a path down the fragile pink face from brow to chin . " Luz . H 'm ? We 'll call her Luz . " " No ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the names we 've "  | " Yes , but she looks it , though . All that yellow hair and blue eyes and look at that skin ! Luz Benedict . Luz . It means light . " " Not Luz . Not that . " " What then ? " " You 'd think I was some sort of prize cow that has her calf taken away from her after she 's produced it . " " Wrong . Cows feed their calves . " " Oh , all right , if that 's the only language you understand . And if it 's light you want we 'll name her Claire . Not Luz . Never Luz . " " Nothing to get so upset about , honey . You just do n't like Benedict names , that 's all . You were dead against Jordan too , remember ? " " This is different . I ca n't bear it . " " All right . I 'll be big about it . " His arms about the woman and the child , his cheek against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession . " I guess I 'm so set up about these two kids  --  two new Benedicts for Reata  --  I wo n't admit anybody else has a right to them . Even their mother . My darling girl . My two darling girls . . . . All right then . Your turn this time . If Claire is what you want then it 'll be Claire . " But he fell into the habit of calling her Luz . Just a kind of nickname , he said . And in time the child and everyone who knew her forgot that she ever had had another name . Only Leslie remembered . Even she , in time , became accustomed to the use of the name she hated . The child was Luz to the hundreds on Reata , Luz at school , Luz to her friends . She herself forgot the name of Claire and signed herself Luz Benedict . At school in the East she explained , " I was named for my aunt , Luz Benedict . You ought to hear the stories about her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County began to approve of Leslie . In a limited way . Mrs. Jordan Benedict  --  vou know  --  Bick Benedict 's wife . Yes , she took to Texas like a heifer to cake . You would n't hardly know she was n't a Texian born , only a little ways . Two children , boy and girl . Now she longed for a glimpse of her family ; for Virginia , forp341a taste of the easy graceful life of her girlhood . " This is your home . But you talk as if you were homesick , " Bick said . " I suppose I am . I suppose I will be until I see it again . " " It 's going to feel mighty funny to me , end of the day , no kids no wife . " " It will be fine for both of us . We 've been together every day every night since the day we were married . " " Is n't that good ? " " It 'll be better after a few weeks apart . " " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up and call for you . I 'll have to go to Washington anyway about that time . That 's what I 'll do . Otherwise you 'd probably never come back to this poor old beat-up cow hand . " Though they spoke lightly they were both terribly in earnest . This was more than a little visit with the family back home in Virginia . This was a long look around . This was a separation in spirit as well as body . These two terribly dissimilar people would not admit even to themselves that they were about to take a cooldetached look at the brief tale of their married years , and a long speculative look at the years that stretched ahead . In the spring she made the trip to Virginia , traveling true to Benedict tradition in a private car with two Mexican nursemaids ; Petra her own maid ; a welter of trunks , boxes , bags , small luggage ; and gifts ranging from a complete Western riding outfit for Lacey including saddle boots hat , to crates of Valley grapefruit and bushels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chills and fever as the Southwest receded , then the Midwest was left behind and the train approached the Eastern seaboard . Her father . The lovely rambling old shabby house . Lacey . Apple trees in bloom . Rich green grass in the meadows . Her mother . In exactly that order of her longing . Jordy and Luz were dressed within an inch of their lives hours before they reached their destination , managed to ruin this effect , were undressed , dressed again . The safari wound its way out of the train to the station platform in such a brouhaha of squeals shrieks chatter laughter tears Spanish English and Southern sweetp342talk that Leslie only tardily became aware of the actual presence of her sister Leigh , Lady Karfrey , here in the flesh in Virginia instead of being a voice on the overseas telephone from England . " Leigh ! " Her surprise was less than completely joyous . She looked about her . " Is Alfred with you ? " She hoped not , she wanted only her own dear family for this homecoming . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mad to see Texas . " " To see Texas ! " Leslie repeated with sinking heart . Then , hastily , " He would n't like it . " But there was no time now to go into this . jordy and Luz were being kissed , exclaimed over , thoroughly disorganized . Howling , they were carried off by their Mexican nurses who conversed in a torrent of Spanish to the Lynntons ' Negro servants . With the miraculous rapport of the minorities they understood each other . Mrs. Lynnton said , " Leslie ! Your skin ! " She said , " Leslie ! Your hair ! " She said , " Leslie Lynnton , that 's one of your old trousseau dresses . Well , I should think the wife of a husband with three million acres would be able " Only two and a half , Mama . " Lady Karfrey said , " You travel like an East Indian maharanee . I thought Texas was a republic or a democracy or something . Do all Texans travel with a retinue ? " " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massive Western saddle , the hand-tooled boots , belt , reata , as one would gaze upon an exhibit of prehistoric tribal utensils . The saddle especially fascinated her . " It looks like a rocking chair . And all that carving ! It weighs tons , does n't it ? . . . What a pommel ! Goodness , look at it miles high , what do they use it for  --  flying the Texas flag ? " Doctor Horace Lynnton said , " Well , Leslie . " It was she who threw her arms about him and held him close as if he were a child . " Oh , Papa ! " He looked so much older than she had remembered him , so much frailer , so much paler and more stooped . " Oh , Papa , you are n't have you been well ? " " You 've been looking at seven-foot beef eaters for two years , all Eastern men will look like albino dwarfs to you . "  |p343He  held her off and regarded her with the eyes of a loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head as at the conclusion of a satisfactory diagnosis . " You 've come through it all right . Some scar tissue . But in the main a triumph . " " Through what ? " snapped Lady Karfrey . " One would think she 'd been to the wars and back . " Leigh Lynnton Karfrey of the tart tongue had always been tinged with the jealousy of the firstbornfor the next in years . " What has your darling daughter been through that 's so terrible ! " " Through the first years of marriage . Two children in two years . And Texas . It makes any mere warrior look like a sissy . " Doctor Horace rolled a non-existent pill between thumb and forefinger , an elderly habit that Leslie had never heretofore noticed in him . In a haze of sentimental remembrance Leslie walked through the lovely and beloved old house . The drawing room . How faded the curtains were . Her old bedroom so tidy now , with the bed head pushed against the wall . It all looked shabbier than she had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller . There was the apple orchard in bloom . With the new vision of one who has seen a vast domain equipped with every modern mechanical device she noted that the trees badly needed spraying and pruning and mulching . There in Virginia and Washington and Maryland were the boys and girls  --  men and women now  --  with whom she had spent her carefree girlhood and the more serious years of young womanhood during the war . Now they welcomed her with all manner of festivities . Cocktail parties . Hunt balls . Dinner parties . Teas . Receptions . Luncheons . Presidential , ambassadorial , senatorial affairs , quite splendid and formal . Local society affairs , quite the opposite . " But Leslie , you ca n't go to all these things in those clothes ! " Even Lacey , of the erstwhile overalls , was scornful of Leslie 's dated gowns . " The new things are way below the knees , and some evening dresses are almost to the floor . " Mrs. Lynnton took her daughter in hand . " It 's bad enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years looking like ap344frump . But she does it purposely . She tries to out-English the English . They 've always been dowdy , God knows , but since the war they 've made a religion of it . Leigh 's brought along enough scratchy old tweeds for daytime and moth-eaten old portieres for evening to make a British county wardrobe . " " But Mama , you know perfectly well Jordy was born almost on the dot of nine months . I had hardly time to change from my traveling suit to a negligee when I found I was pregnant . " " Do n't be common , Leslie . " " Well uh " Leslie indulged in a noncommittal grin . " Then just as I 'd got myself pulled together and thought I'dgo to Hermoso or Dallas on a dress-buying spree " Dallas ! " " You 'd be surprised . So then it was Luz . And here I am . " " Well , Washington 's no place for shopping , heaven knows , but it will have to do . You ca n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoe-down . " There was a great deal of talk about a catastrophe called the Crash , and a long-lasting condition known as the Depression . This , it seemed , was an emotional as well as a financial condition . People dated things from it as they once used the war as a basis for time computation . Before the war . During the war . After the war . Now they said , " No , we have n't had one since the Depression . . . . I used to but that was before the Depression . . . . He 's been like that ever since the Depression . " She was having a dazzling time of it . Old friends , new clothes , delicious food ; gaiety , amusing talk ; girlhood beaux who had not found consolation in her absence . Surprisingly , they all seemed to have learned quite a lot about Texas . Modern Texas . " How did you know that ! " Leslie would exclaim when someonereferred airily to the vast Hake or Beezer or Waggoner or King or Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyscraper in Houston . " Everybody knows about Texas , " they said . " It 's getting to be the fashion . Pretty soon Texans wo n't even have to brag any more.  |p345A  newly met acquaintance at a Washington dinner might say , " I know you 're from Texas , Mrs. Benedict . Well , of course we 've all heard of the fabulous goings-on down there . Exaggerated , I suppose ? " " No . Understated . " If he happened to be a somewhat stuffy newcomer he would smile uncertainly , scenting a note of sarcasm . Reassured by Leslie 's earnest gaze , he would go on . " But I suppose the Depressionhas hit you folks down there just as it has everyone else . Wall Street has a long reach . " " No one ever complains about the Depression down there . I do n't think it has touched them . Us . When I left Texas everything seemed as booming as always . If anything , a little more so . " Her warm and charming smile took some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sigh as he drank a mouthful of pleasant dinner wine . " If I were twenty years younger I 'd go down there and start all over again . " After the first two weeks her nostalgic longing was satisfied . She took to visiting Caroline in the kitchen in quest of that gifted woman 's somewhat haphazard recipes . " Yes , but just how much sugar , Caroline ? " Or flour or baking powder or butter or lemon . " It 's delicious when you make it , but what are the quantities ? " " A body cai n't be so businessified about how much this and how much that , Miss Leslie . I just th'ow in . " Mrs. Lynnton said , " You did n't come up here to fuss around in the kitchen . If your cook is n't suitable why do n't you send her away ? " " My cook is a he . Not bad . I 've tried to teach him a lot of Virginia recipes . But the Mexicans are n't very gifted with our kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin looks blotchy . Chili and red peppers and all sorts of strange hot spices . Deathly ! " " Reata food is now considered epicurean . Most of Texas prefersbeef cut hot off the steer and flung into the frying pan . " When at last she encountered Nicky Rorik the conversation and the emotions in which they became involved were somethingp346of a shock to both of them . Safely Mrs. Jordan Benedict , mother of two . The Pink Coat was at the point of marrying an attractive rather prim girl of Pittsburgh derivation whose grandfather ( not at all hale at the moment ) possessed one of the four greatest fortunes in the Western Hemisphere . Leslie and Nicky relaxed comfortably and had a real talk . " According to the storybooks , " Leslie said , " I ought to find you pallid and what-did-I-see-in-him . But my goodness you 're attractive , Nicky ! " " If I were to tell you what I feel about you this minute you would leave me sitting here . Leslie . " " It 's pleasant to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost in love in a nice  --  or maybe not so nice  --  kind of way . " And then along came that enormous Texan . " " Not so enormous , really , when he 's stacked up against his native state . Anyway , it would n't have done . No money in the Lynnton family  --  if you do n't mind my putting it crudely . Is she terribly rich ? " " Fantastic . " " And very nice , I hear . " " She is a little like you . A carbon copy , fourth perhaps and not sharp and clear like the original . But like . " " Your country will be grateful to you . And to her . " It was all very reassuring . She wondered if she could possibly tell Jordan . No , of course not . Still , it would be pleasant to think about later , perhaps , when she was older and the children had the measles and Jordan was even more matter-of-fact than usual . Lady Karfrey was proving something of a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of days she attacked the business at hand with her usual ferocity , possessed as she was of a drive equal to Leslie 's but with none of Leslie 's charm . " I 've been studying up on your Texas , Leslie . I must say you do n't seem to talk much about it . " " I did n't think you 'd be particularly interested , " Leslie countered faintly.  | " Of course I am as we 're going down I hope . Now tell me , what do you do down there ? For society , I mean . I know it 's a ranch , and millions of miles . But what do you do ? I mean concertsplays clubs gardening politics committees ? House guests ? " " Uh , no gardening , dearie . Do n't confuse the Texas climate with Kent , England . But house guests , yes . Hordes of house guests . " " That will be stimulating . But what do you do ? All that land and all those cows . You do n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh  --  people visit , sort of . And everybody drinks a lot of coffee . " " Coffee ! " " Oh , my poor darling girl ! " moaned Mrs. Lynnton , who was sitting over the breakfast crumbs with her two daughters . " Poor me eye ! " Leslie said briskly , to her own surprise . Lady Karfrey now moved in for the kill . " Alfred always has been fascinated by Texas , he 's mad to have a look at it . His grandfather , you know , had an interest in that vast thing that went bust in the 187os , was n't it ? Called the T. and P. Whatever that means . " " Texas and Pacific Railroad . " Horace Lynnton now spoke from the corner of the veranda off the dining room where he had been smoking his pipe , viewing the Virginia sky through the fallingapple blossoms , and listening to the acquired English accent of his least favorite and eldest daughter . " It went bust through Jay Cooke and those big Wall Street boys in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . The railroad was to service the big ranches that the English were supposed to buy . " Speculatively Leslie surveyed her formidable sister . " Just imagineif it had n't failed , Leigh . You 'd have been the Texan in the Lynnton family . Though I do n't know how you 'd have met Alfred . " " Let 's talk about our visit . When would it be convenient for you ? " " Leigh , we 'd love to have you , of course . But I do n't know thatp348you 'd like it , really . Alfred is n't used to  --  he 'd find it too terribly hot after the cool English " Nothing 's too hot for the English , " Leigh Karfrey stated with great definiteness . " Or too cold . Remember India . And Hudson 's Bay . And all that . They just put on a topee or long woolen underwearas the case may be , and thrive . They always have . " " But you can be frying under the sun at noon and freezing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " It sounds absolutely Alfred 's cup of tea , " said Lady Karfrey . Leslie tried to imagine Sir Alfred at Reata . A chubby little Englishman with a somewhat falsetto speaking voice and a mottled magenta coloring . He doted on good food , had a name as a collector of antiques and bibelots . Christie 's and Fortnum and Mason 's were always sending him special notices . " Besides , " Leslie said deliberately , " I do n't know when I 'm going back . " There was the silence that follows indrawn breaths . When she had recovered , " Just what does that mean ! " demanded Mrs. Lynnton . " Benedict 's in Washington , is n't he , next week , that is ? " Lady Karfrey marshaled her facts . " He 's calling for you , is n't he ? To take you and the children back ? You said . " " That was the plan . " " Was ! " shrilled Mrs. Lynnton . Doctor Horace Lynnton stood framed in the veranda doorway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pa , Leslie ? I 've hardly seen you or talked to you since you came . Really , I mean . And now this talk of going back home . " Wordlessly she joined him , she tucked her hand in his arm , close , as they descended the broad shallow steps to the garden . Horace Lynnton 's voice , louder than necessary , came clearly to the undeceived ears of his wife and eldest daughter . " I 've been at the hospital every day , you 're at some party every night . Next thing I know you 'll be gone . Why do n't you stay until you 're really ready to " Well ! " said Leigh Karfrey to her mother . " What do you make of that ! "  |p349The  somewhat stooped elderly man and the blooming young woman walked close together through the garden , through the orchard , across the meadow and into the woods as lovers would have walked , seeing nothing with the conscious eye . Silent . When Doctor Lynnton broke the silence it was as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something no one can decide for you . But if you feel like talking about it a little . " " Oh , Papa . I 'm so confused . " " You do n't love him ? " " That 's the terrible part of it . I do . Not only that , I 'm in love with him . More than when I married him . " " But he seems to me to have a first-rate mind , too . Not only smart but aware and civilized . And amusing , too , I thought . Amusing is very important after the first years . " She thought of her mother . Not amusing . She pressed his arm . " Yes , he 's all those things . But he 's got that blind spot . Papa , he and I do n't see alike about a single thing  --  except unimportant things . Handsome intelligent sexy ambitious successful vital amusing tender tough . Everything . " " But " Power-mad . Dictator . His thoughts and energies and emotions are bounded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's not unkind to people . Around , I mean . But to him they 're only important in relation to the ranch , his life , Texas . He 'll never change . " " No , we do n't change . " " We ? " " Dedicated men . Men primarily in love with their work . Like Bick . And me . " As she stared at him , peered into his face openmouthed , like a child : " Leslie , your mother talked the same way . Poor girl , she 's had a thin enough time of it too all these years while I 've been pouring myself into the laboratories and hospitals . She 's had what was left , and it was n't much . It was unreasonable of me to expect her to understand . So I took it out on you girls.  |p350I  tried to make you conscious of the world . Your mother never changed . But neither did I. " " Jordan will never change . I know that now . " " No . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world will . It 's changing at a rate that takes my breath away . Everything has speeded up like those terrific engines they 've invented these past few years . Faster and faster , nearer and nearer . Your Bick wo n't change  --  nor you  --  but your children will take another big step . Enormous step , probably . Some call it revolution but it 's evolution , really . Sbmetimes slow sometimes fast , horrible to be caught in it helpless . But no matter how appalledyou are by what you see down there in that strange chunk of the United States , still , you 're interested . Are n't you ? " " Fascinated . But rebelling most of the time . " " What could be more exciting ! As long as you 're fascinated and as long as you keep on fighting the things you think are wrong , you 're living . It is n't the evil people in the world who do the most harm . It 's the sweet do-nothings that can destroy us . Dolce far niente . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful world . Gangrene . The sweet sickening smell of rotting flesh . " Bick Benedict , when he arrived , seemed by his very buoyance to make all this talk mere academic babble . He was a mass of charm and high spirits . Virile handsome actually boyish , Leslie thought she never had seen him so pleased with himself and the world . His arms about her , Jordy and Luz flung themselves at him . In the first flush of their reunion she thought it was herself and the children that gave him this vibrating aura of well-being and elation . But she began to detect something within himself that was the source of this bubbling . Surveying him with a wifely gaze , " What makes you so full of beans ? This glitter in your eye ca n't be just wife and children . " " Purely spiritual , honey . It 's just the result of all that highmindedtalk down there in Washington . They 've voted to continue the twenty-seven percent tax allowance on oil . Clear . "  | " But you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hated the stinking oil wells . " " That 's right . " " I do n't understand . " " But I 'm right petted on oil  --  off my land . I do n't mind others having it because from now on the whole world is going to be yelling for oil . Texas is booming . The rest of the country is flat . " " Is that good ? " " Only good enough to make us the richest state in the whole country . We 're a country within a country . " " Again ! " " Oil and beef and cotton . You ca n't stop it , you ca n't top it . " He breathed deeply , for a moment she thought she saw a strained look in his eye . He gazed around and about the Virginia landscapeand he laughed . " God , it looks little ! The fields . And the sky . Are you ready to come back with your old man , honey ? " " Jordan , I 'm no different from what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you different . We Texians like a little vinegar on our greens . Gives it flavor . Come on , let 's go home . "  |p352ON  THE JOURNEY homeward Leslie said , " If you had told me , on our honeymoon , that the next time we made this trip I 'd be traveling with you and masses of our children and hundreds of nurses and millions of bags and bottles and toys and stuff ! " " You 'd have made it anyway . " " You 're so pleased with yourself I think this is the time to tell you that Leigh meant it when she said she and Karfrey want to visit Reata . " " Why not ! " Bick demanded , largely . " Penned up on that little island all their lives ! Do ' em good to have to hunt for the horizon.  |p354Anyway  , it 'll be worth it just to see Karfrey in a ten-gallon hat . " " I wish Papa and Mama would come down at the same time . And Lacey too . Just to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a sign of strain . " That 's a fine idea . Folks down here are beginning to think you 're an orphan . Look , I 'm going to send them all a telegram at the next stop . " Down they came to Reata , the lot of them . " Do you mean to tell me , " demanded Mrs. Lynnton , " that I am not going to be allowed to sleep under the same roof with my daughter and my grandchildren ! " " Mama dear , you 're staying in the Big House because there is n't room here in our house . You 'd go simply crazy here , and I do n't like to shush the children . Over there it 's bigger and quieter and more restful for you . " " Restful ! The place is full of utter strangers stamping and jingling through the halls all hours of the day and night . Nobody even knows who they are . I asked one of those Mexican girls . She just shook her head and jabbered something in Spanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People he has to see . Or they come to see the ranch . They come from everywhere . " " What are you running ? A hotel ! God knows we 're hospitable in Virginia . But this ! " " Mama , this is n't just a ranch . It 's a scientific laboratory too . And a kind of show place for the whole ranching world . Reata and the King ranch and the Hakes ' Double B and a few others are sort of famous , you know . People come to see and learn . Jordan loves it . He 's breeding a new kind of cattle . " " If God had meant to have men create new cattle He 'd have given them the job in the first place , with all He had to do . " The family visitors adapted themselves to the climate , the environmentand the customs with astonishing ease . Lacey was off on a horse from morning until night , she was more at home in thep355stables than the house . The vaqueros adopted her as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English . Even old Polo demonstrated to her the value of the new breed of fleet-footed creatures whose swift quarter-mile spurting powers were invaluable in the roundup and on the range . Quarter horses , they were called . IMrs . Lynnton took alarm . She sought out Bick . " Lacey spends all her time with those Mexican men , no one knows where she is the day through and half the night . I 've spoken and spoken to Horace about it but he 's as bad as she is . " Bick grinned , he pretended to misunderstand . " No ! You mean the Doctor 's galloping around on quarter horses ! " " You know perfectly well he 's down at that laboratory of yours with that vet , or poking into the wretched shacks around here , looking for local diseases , they 're worse than any slave quarters in the old Virginia days I can tell you . " He could not be angry with her , actually , though he thought privately that he would like nothing better than to drive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reata was a country in itself to which each visitor could adapt according to his or her own taste . Luxury or hardship , leisure or work . Lacey ate her midday meal out on the range with the vaqueros . In the evening she reported on her day , to the horror of Mrs. Lynnton . " For lunch we had some rather awful stuff looked like entrails . And beans of course . Do n't they ever tire of beans ! " Mischievously Bick said , " I must ask the boys to fix you up with a tasty dish of magueys . " " Magueys ? " " It 's quite a Mexican delicacy . White maguey worms fried crisp . Elegant eating . " A squawking sound from Mrs. Lynnton . Sir Alfred took a more world-wise view . " Why not ? All foreigners eat certain beastly messes . Look at the French with their snails ! " " True , true , " agreed Horace Lynnton . " And is there anything more repulsive-looking than a succulent Baltimore soft-shell crab ?    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
