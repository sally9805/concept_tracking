<P> For years now , echoes have come across the lost horizon from remote Tibet that the Chinese Communists were having trouble digesting their 1950 conquest . Many of the reports of revolt and fighting came from refugees who in their excitement did not have all the facts straight , and when the details collapsed , so did the reports . But in 1957 Peking itself confirmed that all was not well : faced with passive opposition from Tibet 's powerful Buddhist lamas and landlords , the Reds announced postponement of Communist " reforms " in Tibet for another six years . <P> Last week the Indians , who in their anxiety not to offend Peking have previously pooh-poohed rumors of trouble in Tibet , confirmed reports that tough Khamba tribesmen , who have been raiding for centuries against all intruders in Tibet , have now taken on the Reds . According to the reports , up to 8,000 of the leather-booted Khambas , swinging ancient swords on horseback , taking potshots with captured Red rifles and pushing boulders down the mountain sides onto Chinese truck convoys have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basin of the Brahmaputra River south of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa . So far , they appear to be fighting more for themselves than in the name of the 23-year-old Dalai Lama , who with Red consent has managed to stay on his lacquered throne as Tibet 's titular ruler . <P> The Indians , who are no longer openly cordial to Peking but are still determined to be correct , are disturbed by the rumblings to the north . They fear that if the Reds rout the tribesmen , the Khambas might seek refuge in India or the buffer states of Nepal , Sikkim and Bhutan between India and China , providing China with a pretext for extending the fighting beyond Tibet into areas that Peking already claims as Chinese . Or , if the revolt spreads to include other Tibetans , the Reds might be driven to pouring in troops to put down the uprising , and force through the Communization of Tibet . <P> Either way , neutralist India would prefer not to have to think about it .
