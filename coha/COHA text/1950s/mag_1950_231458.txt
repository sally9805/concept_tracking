Safely out of Czechoslovakia and the reach of the Communist Secret Police , who were about to arrest him on a trumped-up charge of espionage ( TIME , June 19 ) , Correspondent Dana Adams Schmidt sat down to his typewriter in Vienna and began a new series of dispatches to the New York Times . Out of the range of Prague 's Communist censors , he wrote at length and in detail . His dispatches , published in the Times last week , gave a sharp picture of the tragedy that enveloped Czechoslovakia 28 months ago when the Communists seized control . <P> <P> " The most characteristic thing about a police state is that people ' disappear , ' " wrote Reporter Schmidt . " It is difficult for the casual visitor to understand that when he enters the office of a business associate the desk in the corner is empty because the secretary who occupied it was arrested last week , or that the girl at the opposite desk is the police spy who denounced her , and who will shortly make a report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " You have to stay around and get to know people before you feel the situation - feel sick and weak when you learn someone you know has been arrested , nauseated by a note summoning you to a police station , angered every time you see one of those unmistakable men in brown leather coats the STB-Czechoslovak Secret Police . . . The police are rarely brutal . But I know or know of persons who have been beaten , persons who have been questioned for 24 hours . . . where the sound of other people being beaten in the next room could be heard . " <P> A Sieve a Week . Power in Czechoslovakia rests in the hands of a small , inscrutable inner circle of Communists , who get their orders from the offices of the Cominform in Bucharest or directly from Moscow . Most notable member of this inner circle is Rudolf Slansky , secretary general of the party . Other members , according to the Times 's Schmidt , are Bedrich Gemmder , contactman for the Cominform Defense Minister Dr. Alexej Cepicka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not include President Klement Gottwald , chairman of the Communist Party , or Prime Minister Antonin Zapotocky . ( While both men seem to hold undisputed authority , it has been rumored that Moscow does not completely trust them . ) The entire population is covered by a secret police network , fed by informers among the party members . Chief object of police persecution is the middle class , about 20,000 to 30,000 of whom are now in forced labor camps . New camps are now being built .
