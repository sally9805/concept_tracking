Now and then a rifle crack broke the stillness of the hills , but the Communist insurgents were finding the simpler weapons of rumor , exaggeration and bluff sufficient to keep their campaign going . Operating in little bands of 5 to 25 men , they sent heralds ahead to frighten villages with stories of Communist hordes about to descend , of real or imaginary atrocities committed near by , of the fall of a government fort . Sometimes they rowed back and forth across a river to give the impression of large numbers . Sometimes they herded villages of people before them to make an attack seem bigger . <P> The tactics of psychological warfare were working fine last week among the primitive and superstitious northern tribesmen of Laos , in the provinces of Phongsaly and Samneua on the border of Communist North Viet Nam . It was these northern areas , occupied by the Communists until 1957 , that the insurgents seemed most determined to conquer . Often , villages were occupied without a fight . In some , families packed hastily and paddled away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists approached . Last week the banks of the Mekong at the royal capital of Luangpra-bang were dotted with bamboo huts built by newly arrived refugees from threatened areas ; at week 's end Communist bands were stirring up incidents in the vicinity of the royal capital itself . <P> No Helicopters . It was an odd kind of war , with little bloodshed . Several army outposts abandoned their stations before a terrorist hove in sight . Company and platoon units , with no radio contact with higher headquarters , were out of touch for days at a time . Often Laos ' creaky , eight-plane air force could not get supplies to isolated garrisons , and more than one slightly wounded trooper died at a monsoon-soaked outpost for the lack of a road or airstrip to get him out to a doctor ; in all Laos there is not one helicopter . In Samneua-the province in greatest danger of Communist takeover , where an 800-square-mile area is now controlled by Communist rebels-a surrounded paratroop company could not be reinforced by troops waiting to jump in and help ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered by word last week that the U.S. will soon airlift supplies-such items as tents . Jeeps , small arms and radio sets-to aid them . But the main difficulty of staunchly anti-Communist Premier Phoui Sananikone lies in the fact that the poor , discontented , primitive half of Laos ' 2,000,000 people have never developed loyalty to the central government . <P> Unhappy Mountaineers . These mountaineers-the Black Thai , the primitive Kha , the opium-growing Meo-have long disliked being ruled by the Lao of the south . A few among the wild hill people fight on the side of the Communist Pathet Lao ; many more have a passive indifference toward the government . <P> Little Laos gets more U.S. aid per capita than almost any other nation but virtually nothing of the $250 million sent by the U.S. has ever gone to benefit the remote sections of the country now being overrun by Communist rebels .
