Lucky McDaniel 's technique of instruction was described to a number of scientists and resulted in a number of very tentative hypotheses to explain it . Most explanations suggested that hypnotism might be a factor , though not necessarily the kind in which a person is overtly put into a trance . // There is a more subtle stage of hypnotism , most often called " suggestion . " Dr. Donald B. Douglas of the Psychiatric Institute , New York City , defined suggestion as a state in which the subject 's unconscious mind willingly follows instructions from another person , suspending all volition , because the subject wants to be persuaded . And who , indeed , would not want to be persuaded that he can shoot like Wild Bill Hickok ? On the other hand , who would not want to be persuaded that he can hit a golf ball like Sam Snead , and how many golf pros are turning out Sam Sneads these days ? The point about McDaniel is that he , unlike the golf pros , is able to teach anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time . // Dr. Henry Makover , Professor of Preventive Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine , speaking very informally , thought there might be still another explanation not necessarily involving hypnosis. // " In all forms of athletics , " he said , " there are moments , sometimes whole days , in which an individual is capable of giving a physical performance within his sport , which , for him , is almost impossible generally . Every golfer knows such days . At a particular time , for a reason which we do not know , all physical coordinative elements of the individual may function together in a manner which permits a performance many times the individual 's normal ability . " // At this point Dr. Makover , who never has met McDaniel , uttered a precise paraphrase of what McDaniel says . // " Within most people , " to put it Dr. Makover 's way , " there is a physical potential far greater than that which is realized in normal activity . " // The way McDaniel puts it is this : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses know more than we do . " // Or , to return to Dr. Makover : " There exists , I believe , in the general population a greater potential for accuracy than is realized , but for a number of reasons ... this potential can not be exploited at all times . It is conceivable that McDaniel , wittingly or unwittingly , has discovered a technique of exploitation of this faculty which functions in the majority of people on whom he experiments . " // McDaniel says that " the power of suggestion " is a factor in his teaching . And he also says that everyone is capable of far greater feats than he is aware of . A McDaniel come to judgment maintains that he can condition a man 's reflexes to a point where he is able to realize his capacities . // So , too , say the Zen Buddhists , whose adepts perform astonishing feats of archery , like extinguishing a candle while blindfolded . Then , to delve perhaps more shallowly into the esoteric , there is Dr. Joseph B. Rhine of Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind to influence the actions of such objects as dice . That , of course , has more to do with crapshooting than bird shooting .
