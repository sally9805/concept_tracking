In the first years of television , U.S. newspaper editors worried that the new medium would capture many of their readers by covering news as it happened . So far , the worries have been groundless ; TV news programs have added little to the technique of reporting , have often been no better than radio newscasts-and sometimes not as good . Last week , in an effort to change all that , NBC launched an ambitious , two-hour global news roundup - with records and special events thrown in-called Today ( Monday through Friday ; 7-9 a.m . E.S.T. ) . <P> All Set . How did the experiment turn out ? After squirming through the two hours of the program , John Crosby , the sharp-witted Radio &; TV critic of the New York Herald Tribune , decided the time had come to read NBC-and telecasters in general-a lecture of what 's wrong with their news programs . Said Crosby : there is a " basic lack of understanding of the purpose of communications , which is , after all , just a conveyor , not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garroway ( kittenishly billed as a ' Communicator " ) had " the most magnificent array of communications equipment ever put into one room . . . telephones , television monitors , telephoto machines , intercoms , wireless . Everything was 11 set in case anything was happening anywhere . " But , for the telecasters , " nothng was . " <P> For example , the ranging TV eye fixed on Admiral William M. Fechteler , Chief of Naval Operations , on the steps of the Pentagon on his way to work . " Can you give us a pronouncement on the state of he Navy ? " asked NBC 's reporter . " Well , <P> I do n't know , " said Admiral Fechteler . " When I left it yesterday , it was in great shape . " " Thank you , Admiral Fechteler , " cried the reporter triumphantly . Said Critic Crosby : " The fact is Admiral Fechteler had n't opened his mail yet . " <P> Communicator Garroway went on with his program : " Hello , Ed Haaker in Frankfurt . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Replied Haaker : " The big news is the weather . We had our first big storm of the year . We 're really chilly . " Said Garroway : " You 're not alone . Goodbye , Ed . " <P> Above All ... What was the point in having a foreign correspondent on the phone if he had nothing to say ? As for telling the actual news , the program merely gave a brief resume of Page One headlines . By so doing , concluded Crosby , the TV editors relied " much too heavily on the newspapers and news services , much too little on their own imaginations . Newspapers and news services are geared for the printed page , not for this new and challenging medium whose demands are so different . The same news story - let 's say the explosive situation in the Near East- should not be handled entirely on a spot news basis as it is in the press- waiting , that is , for the riots , the assassination , or whatever comes - because when the spot news breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cameras should be out there now - probing , sifting , analyzing and explaining what might come and , above all , why . "
