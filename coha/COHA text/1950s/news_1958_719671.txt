txt Today is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the World Health Organization . This is one of the specialized agencies organized , under the aegis of the United Nations . Ten years ago twenty-six nations ratified its constitution . Today it has eighty-eight members . Its operations extend to almost every part of the globe and they are affecting the lives and welfare of roughly half the world 's population . There are several good reasons why the conquest of disease and the promotion of conditions under which health is possible should be , basically , an international enterprise . In the first place , the actual communication of epidemic disease is no respecter of national boundaries . A threat at one point may well be a threat at a dozen others . Moreover , this very threat has been increased by the tightening of the network of international communications . The recognition of this phase of the problem is not new . It forafed the basis for the splendid work that was done by the League of Nations in the establishment of uniform operation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . Cities were protected against plague ; whole populations were made more safe against the danger of yellow fever . And , most important , it was established that this could be an effective service only if it were sustained , voluntarily , through the cooperation of many different peoples . Beyond that lies the fact that the great advances in the science of health likewise know no- national boundaries . What is learned at one point may be most valuable in its application at another . The medical scientist is first of all a citizen of the world , devoted to the cause of human beings wherever his skills and discoveries may be most usefully brought to bear . A laboratory in Europe may provide the weapons to make a great fight in Africa . A technologist in the United States may develop a therapy , relatively limited in his own country , but affecting hundreds of millions of persons on the other side of the world . This , also , is not a new concept . Almost every blanch of medicine has had its international organize= tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted that what was learned in one part of the world could and would be used in another . What the United Nations , and an agency such as the World Health Organization , have been able to do is to offer a splendid clearing ground for the pooling of information and the application of knowledge so obtained to a diversity of problems . It is interesting to note , in this connection , that the organization has worked , from the beginning , in the closest association with local and national groups . It has not tried , at sky time , to supersede good work that was already being done by other instruments . It has merely offered more , and sometimes betterCoordinated , help . The results in these ten years have been spectacular . A major target has been the greatest of the international scourges , malaria , and it is now predicted that it can be eradicated by-the middle of the next decade . Meanwhile , epidemics of cholera , plague and typhus ' have been checked . Effective treatment has been . provided for trachoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even tuberculosis are yielding to more highly . developed techniques of both prevention and cure . ? The whole pattern of the world 's health is being changed before our very eyes . Survival rates are totally different from what they were a generation ago , . Tile gains . in the " advanced " countries have been easily tabulated . In the " underdeveloped " areas there is the likelihood that they will shortly be even more astonishing . But what is most astonishing of all is the size of the budget upon which this organization operates . This year it will spend about $13 , - 500,000 , of which a third is contributed by the United States . In our time of astronomical expenditures for the business of developing weapons of destruction , this expenditure for the weapons of salvation is minuscule . Yet it is doubtful that at any time in history have so many . gained from the expenditure of so little . Th  --  whole life pattern of millions of persons has been changed for the better at a cost that in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible because the organization has expended more than money . It has given skill , experience , imagination and , above all , dedication to a great task . We celebrate its anniversary . We can best do so by increasing its scope and its means .
