You know , whenever I see a father here with us , I wonder whether he had some reason for not wanting to go to work . " All heads turn to look at this adult truant .

The man on the evening shift travels in comfort to work , at a nonrush hour pace , surrounded only by the women going in for a bit of shopping before meeting their husbands in town . He bids the children good night as he leaves , tells his wife not to wait up for him because undoubtedly he wo n't be able to get away early tonight , and hurries off to prepare for meeting the evening 's deadlines  --  hardly missing the ordinary social activity and community responsibilities that soon will be swirling around all those normal people who follow a sensible schedule .
