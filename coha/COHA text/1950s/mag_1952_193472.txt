Asked the Atlanta Constitution 's Editor Ralph McGill : " Why did he have to do it Saturday night ? " For newspapermen , President Truman could hardly have picked a worse time to announce he would not run again ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Many dailies had only the usual weekend skeleton crews on hand to handle one of the biggest political stories of the year , and their presses had already rolled off a big chunk of their fat Sunday editions when the big news came through . Most had been decoyed into a false security by an advance text of Truman 's speech sent out at 11 a.m. which said not a word about his intentions . Nevertheless , when he news came through at 10:58 by radio , ront pages were torn up so fast that many Dapers were on the streets with the news within half an hour . <P> No one was better prepared for the unexpected than the New York Times . For its two-page summary of the " News of the Week in Review , " which usually closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chances . He had ordered four different leads written for the section ( will run , wo n't run , etc . ) . When the speech came through , staffers quickly dropped in he right heads and lead , caught two-birds of the Sunday press run with a complete story on the Truman decision . <P> In Portland , an Oregon Journal photographer excitedly ran eight blocks to the Civic Auditorium where Margaret Truman was about to start a concert . Panting , he momentously told her the news . She sweetly replied that she had known it . In Chicago , the Sun-Times spread across its centerfold two pages of pictures of Truman from cradle to Jefferson-Jackson banquet . Many a paper , - e.g. , the Fort Worth Star-Telegram , had taken a chance and gone to press with stories based on the advance text ( PRESIDENT DOES NOT INDICATE PLANS ) , and shifted to a new banner and the big news before their press run was finished . <P> In rounding up man-in-the-street reactions , as many papers did , none got a weirder assortment than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the phone book , then decided to " chase around to barrooms , nightclubs and restaurants where most of the people were . " Among those quoted in the first News survey : two all-night restaurant proprietors , the owner of a nightclub , Jimmy Durante , a disk jockey and Sammy Fuchs , the unofficial " mayor " of the Bowery.
