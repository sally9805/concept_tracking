" Oh , women of the Prophet , " commands the Koran " . . . stay quietly in your houses . " A 12th century philosopher was more specific : " A woman should go out of doors only thrice-to go to her husband 's house , to the funeral of her parents and , finally , to her own funeral . " Omar the First ( 581-644 ) advised : " Consult women , and then do the contrary of what they advise . " <P> In the back countries of the Moslem world , the men who can afford it still keep the Allah-granted quota of four wives . Unable to read , forbidden to attend schools , or to listen to the deliberations of the males , millions of Islamic women remain quietly in their houses , unaware that there is any world beyond the narrow one visible through the slits in their veils . <P> But in the cities of Islam , time has chipped at the hard pillars of Islamic dogma : <P> In making modern Turkey , Kemal Ata-trk , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in his army and abolished polygamy . In 1930 Turkish women got the vote and the right to public office. * Today women cast 60% of the Turkish vote , and three smart women sit in Parliament . <P> In Syria only eight years ago , a report that some women were going to remove their veils in public touched off a riot . Now , Syrian women who can show a primary-school diploma have the vote . <P> In Lebanon , which is officially half Christian and half Moslem , women press for reforms through nearly 100 women 's clubs dominated by beloved old Ibtihaj Kha-doura , who in 1930 became the first Lebanese woman to rip off the veil . <P> Pakistan , upon its creation in 1947 , began to loosen some of the old restrictions on women : purdah lost ground , women got a couple of seats ( which they still hold ) in the parliament . But the mullahs of Islam have reasserted the old customs ; the Begum Liaquat Ali Khan , widow of the assassinated Premier and once a militant suffragist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of the new Premier hides uncomplainingly in strictest purdah . <P> But it was in Egypt that the stirrings of emancipated women rocked Islam 's elders most , for it took place in the very shadow of the mosques and chambers where the high priests of Islam hold their greatest sway . Well-to-do Egyptian women formed the Feminist National Party . Another group , Daughters of the Nile , led by smart and young ( 34 ) Doria Shafik , a philosophy graduate of the Sorbonne , signed up more than 1,000 upper-class Egyptian women . They prowl Cairo fixing politicians with the same gimlet stare on which Susan B. Anthony and Carrie Chapman Catt once impaled squirming U.S. Senators .
