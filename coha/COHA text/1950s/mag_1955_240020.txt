Violent Saturday ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a big , rough , savvy sort of pell-meller-perhaps the best thing of its crude kind that Hollywood has offered in 1955 . The idea of the picture , trenchantly written by Sydney Boehm and slickly directed by Richard Fleischer , is as simple and as nerve-racking , as a bomb . Three thugs arrive in a small Arizona mining town to hold up the bank . While the robbers prepare their plans , while the bomb ticks away in the mind , the moviegoer stares with itchy horror into the faces and the lives of the innocent bystanders who will be caught in the eventual explosion . <P> Not all the bystanders are outstandingly innocent . The son ( Richard Egan ) of the mineowner is an aging squirt who romances the bottle instead of his wife , and makes rye grimaces at the facts of life . The lady herself ( Margaret Hayes ) is a country-club tramp who indulges in " two or three hobbies a year . " The town librarian ( Sylvia Sidney ) is caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Tommy Noonan ) , whose civic indignation is somewhat dampened by the fact that she has caught him , too , in his secret sin ( he peeps ) . <P> Best of all are the sympathetic insights into the personal problems of a reasonably steady , square-shooting , white-collar criminal ( Lee Marvin ) . The night before the big job the poor fellow can not sleep . Of course he is afraid , but he is also anxious to impress the boss ( Stephen McNally ) and get ahead in the underworld . He paces the floor in his hotel room until all hours , sniffing wretchedly at his " Benny " inhaler . This reminds him of a former wife , a party named Parmalee . Few marriages can have suffered so implacable a description as he gives that one , in seven well-chosen words . " Caught better'n 50 colds from that broad , " he gravels disconsolately . <P> The robbery itself is staged with the subtle unreality - in which dreamy calm and awful violence lie , like lion and lamb , impossibly together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is achieved with a stroke so strong that it makes the rest of the picture seem a little weak . An Amish farmer ( Ernest Borgnine ) , committed by his deepest beliefs to non violence , kills the last of the killers to save the life of an innocent man ( Victor Mature ) . He drives a pitchfork into the brute 's back as if he were a bale of hay ; and yet as he strikes , his eyes convey the heart-stricken awareness , as his lips express the unshakable determination , of an Abraham commanded by a higher power to destroy a life that is dear to him . In this scene , the morality of violence is brought vividly into question , and the question has seldom been answered with more pith and natural majesty . <P> With his sensitive performance in Marty , and now in Violent Saturday , Ernest Borgnine , 37 , is giving moviegoers a satisfying look at a new facet of a talent hitherto largely devoted to villainous sneers . For an actor who looks like a beer-truck driver ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend was too far from his New Haven home ) , the revelation may be just startling enough to launch a new career .
