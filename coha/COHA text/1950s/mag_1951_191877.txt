The French . Assembly this week found itself divided and agitated over two new words , " antianticipationisme " and " antioctobrisme . " Antianticipationistes are those Deputies who want to put off this year 's national elections until October ; antioctobristes want to hold them in June . <P> This bitter dispute about dates was the latest symptom of the Assembly 's deadlock over the issue of electoral reform . Most Deputies agree that the present system of **27;7661;TOOLONG voting must be changed before the next election . The antianticipationistes feel that the Assembly , which has fruitlessly debated the question on &; off since last October , will be unable to find a workable substitute in time for elections in June . <P> Last week , when the Assembly finally passed an electoral reform plan ( the 20th considered ) , it seemed to have made progress . The new plan is designed to keep as many Communists ( and Gaullists ) as possible out of a new Assembly , re-elect as many Deputies as possible from the government coalition ( Socialists . Radical Socialists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute majority , with local party coalitions permitted . This is intended to give the more plastic center parties a golden opportunity to win seats at the expense of the right and the left . <P> But the progress was not real . Government leaders in the Assembly had to strain party discipline to get a bare majority of 263 to 251 for their proposal . Some hundred Deputies , not quite sure how the new law would affect their own election chances , cautiously stayed away or abstained from voting . The bill now goes to the Council of the Republic , which will probably send it back to the Assembly . It will then need an absolute majority of 311 in a second vote to become law-a possibility which the most optimistic government leaders do not see .
