of letters and editorials have assumed that the ills of the National Parks , which I described in the October issue , could be cured if the entrance fees were to be raised . This is a soothing idea but it is wrong . In the first place , the fees collected ( actually for automobile permits ) do not go to the National Park Service but to the U. S. Treasury . That is government practice and very sound : if a bureau could amass funds of its own it would he free of Congressional control . In the second place , the amount needed to rehabilitate the parks is much greater than any increase of fees could provide . ( Can you imagine a fifty-dollar or even a twenty-five-dollar fee for Yellowstone ? ) The present crisis was produced by fourteen years of cumulative neglect . Congress did not provide money to repair the deterioration that went on . unchecked in the parks during the war . It has not provided money to enable the parks to cope with the enormous postwar increase in tourist travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unless both are corrected ? soon ? the parks can never he rehabilitated . Does anyone suppose such appropriations will be provided ? As I write this , the Bureau of the Budget has reduced the appropriation for the next fiscal year somewhat below this year 's , though during the last travel season the number of visitors increased by more than three million and accelerated the breakdown of facilities that were already intolerably overstrained . When this issue of Harper 's appears , the House and Senate appropriations committees will be trying to see how much they can knock off the Bureau 's figures . They customarily cut some items by an arbitrary percentage and others by arbitrary andmysterious round numbers , arrived at in the inscrutable wisdom of statesmanship . This is known as economy in government or letting the plant go to hell , a kind of managerial stupidity that no corporation 's stockholders would permit . A federal bureau which turns a lot of money into the Treasury can ask that some of the take be plowed back for maintenance , but the intangibles with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no show-me value for Congressmen . Meanwhile , the principal job of the Advisory Board on National Parks , of which I have been a member for five years , is to say that it finds no national significance in various semi-scenic Lovers Leaps which Congressmen , urged on by local chambers of commerce , are eager to have added to the national park system ? without appropriations to take care of them . C ONGRESSIONAL neglect could be ended if people who use the parks , or those who think that our grandchildren would like to use them too , understood that the problem exists . In the first ten months of 1953 forty-three million people had visited the parks . All except a handful of them seem to assume that a park ranger , a road , a comfort station , and a fire truck are just like the waterfalls , provided by nature at no expense . One inequity of the fee system was corrected last year . There are now two kinds of entrance permits , one good for a short stay , the other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a park and visit it repeatedly pay twice as much as the casual tourist . So what happens ? Most tourists leave a park before their permits have expired . just beyond the entrance station many give them to boys who sell them at half-price to new arrivals ; many others turn them over direct to the newcomers . Both donor and recipient get intense satisfaction from beating the United States out of a dollar , sometimes up to two dollars and seventy-five cents . ALL the proposals made in the long letter which was run in the December issue were wildly impractical but one was horrifying : that we permit the development of business and amusement centers in the parks . The problem of the concessions , like several other NPS problems , is probably insoluble but the shortest way to destroy the parks completely would be to provide resort services . If it is Coney Island , the Midway . or even Dance/and , it is not a national park . These are areas of climactic natural beauty and supreme scientific importance , and they are primitive areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural condition . Decent comfort for visitors must be assured ( though it is n't at present ) but the parks are not vacation resorts . Some of the pressure on them would disappear , in fact , if it could be made clear to vacationists that they are n't , that there arc no golf courses , roller coasters , or bathing beaches at Many Glaciers . The purpose , I repeat , is to preserve our most majestic scenery intact and in its primitive condition . To this end Congressman Leroy Johnson of California has introduced a bill , HR 1037 , which would change the status of Dinosaur National Monument , making it a national park , and a companion measure , HR 1038 , which would further safeguard Dinosaur and all the parks . The idea is to close Dinosaur to builders of dams , the present law which Forbids dam-building being apparently permeable by the Bureau of Reclamation . The Monument is in the high plateau country of Colorado and Utah . It contains tremendous canyons of the Green and Yampa Rivers and some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal of any of the parks and it is sharply individual , unique , an overpowering spectacle in sculptured stone . It is also an untouched wilderness of almost ridiculously easy access . Bureau of Reclamation propaganda represents it as inaccessible , but arty automobile can reach the edge of the Yampa canyons in half an hour from US 40 and there are places where the river itself can be reached at only a mild risk of getting stuck . The two darns which the Bureau of Reclamation proposes to build there , as part of the development of the Colorado River , would convert majestic canyons into mere creases , reduce vast cliffs to mere embanks , and subdue white water to mill-pond placidity . There are sites outside the Monument where equivalent dams could be built , one of them at less expense . Keep an eye on Congressman Johnson 's bills . The present Administration has not decided what to do about reclamation projects . But even if they should remain in abeyance , private power companies , which , like the government 's dam-builders , have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way in by the gate which the Bureau of Reclamation proposes to open ? and which the bills would lock shut . Up to now the project to which the Dinosaur dams belong has been much too costly for private enterprise but it may not be hereafter . In the provision for tax amortization that was intended for armament plants , the Idaho Power Company has Found a gimmick which could get its dams in Hell 's Canyon built not only free of charge ? that is paid for by the taxpayer ? but with a sixtymillion-dollar bonus for initiative . Meanwhile the Sierra Club has completed a fine film , in color and with sound , of a river trip in Dinosaur . The photography , most of it by Charles Eggert , is superb . It runs just less than thirty minutes and , short of visiting Dinosaur , provides by far the best means we have ever had of comprehending what this magnificent and threatened area is like . Interested organizations can buy , rent , or borrow prints from the Sierra Club , 1050 Mills Tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no news value in saying that my colleague John Kouwenhoven has produced a remarkable book as part of Columbia University 's bicentennial celebration . Mr. Harper said two months ago that The Columbia Historical Portrait of New York costs $21 and is worth it . Even as mere bookmaking it is in fact worth more ; Columbia or Doubleday , the publisher , must be taking a loss on every copy sold . Mr. Kouwenhoven had a freedom few authors have ever enjoyed ; in effect Doubleday told him to disregard expense and consider only what would produce the book he wanted . That turned out to be nine hundred pictures and Columbia has gained a memorial which will still be doing its job at the tercentenary , a hundred years hence . So much the better . All I can remember of the Harvard tercentenary , only eighteen years ago , is the occasion when Dr. Jung was introduced to an audience as Dr. Freud . In one aspect the Portrait is a picture book and let 's say at once that it is surely one of the finest ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bravura . Most people will react it ? I suppose " read " is the verb we must use till language catches up with invention ? as a picture book . But Mr. Kouwenhoven is making several experiments in historiography and from the point of view of the historians it must be approached a good deal more seriously . As history , it . requires a reader to work tolerably hard . One needs at least three readings to establish a base from which to make use of it . It should be read once consecutively and without lingering , to comprehend the extent and variety of the visual record , to observe its tempo , to apprehend the sweep and fluctuation of change , and to take in Mr. Kouwenhoven 's method . Then comes the hard work , a second reading in the book 's own terms , which are those of a major work of history that happens also to he a pioneering work . The second time through must be slow and painstaking , in minute detail , and in relation to as much American history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the more will be returned . It must be scanned with constant cross-reference , which Mr. Kouwenhoven facilitates by frequently directing the reader to consult earlier and later pictures , though the reader must make the comparisons much oftener than he I is told to . Also , this study had better be done with a reading glass at hand . It is needed not only for minute details but because it can separate the planes which gravure reproduction tends to telescope together . After such a study another reading like the first one will produce a far greater yield in historical knowledge than a casual reader would think possible . It also , I believe , will define the possibilities and limitations of the method . S EVERAL difficulties have to be overcome . One of them is unavoidable : as a native of the city , a lover , and a scholar Mr. Kouwenhoven is oriented with the New York scene . One who lacks the threefold qualification must strain to visualize the picture he is looking at against the lie of the land and the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as graphic representation becomes a commoner tool of history : one has to learn how to look at a picture which is being used as a historical document . It is easy to apprehend casual illustrative detail , costumes , say . It is tolerably easy to read the architectural record ? and necessarily such a book as this emphasizes architecture at almost every inoment . But beyond this the historical content has to be sought for ? diligently , You 'll learn from this month 's HOLIDAY that most United States Senators work very hard indeed . You 'll also learn and unlearn much else about your Senate . It is called the World 's Most Exclusive Club . ( It is n't . ) Its members have been called a number of things , from Monster to Unprintable . ( They 're not . ) It is sometimes referred to as the greatest legislative body in the world . ( It might very well he . ) All this is in an article by Blair Moody , who not only was and is a crack newspaperman , but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent appointed to fill out the term of the deceased Senator Vandenberg . ) It 's the most enlightened and enlightening Senate piece we 've ever seen , another in the HOLIDAY series on great American institutions , another example of HOLIDAY 's knack of fitting writer to subject . 111=11=111111 ? studiously , and with historical imagination as well as historical knowledge . And a simple visual fact has to be constantly adjusted to , that in a book of heterogenous pictures , especially one in which there are both drawings and photographs , the optical perspective is always changing . M R. KOUWENHOVEN stresses subjective nature of Isis instrument , repeatedly pointing out that a picture is someone 's way of looking at something . Basically , I assume him to mean , the book tells you about the people who have in the city than about the city they lived in . But people are the content of all history . This instrument is not often more subjective than any other with which historians must work , and what a reader must keep in mind is the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time the men who make the pictures are on the one hand architects or draftsmen or on the other pictorial artists or agents of closely allied special points of view . All have not only pictorial conventions but the particular value-conventions of their trade and class . Not till the development of cheap newspapers and popular magazines do they become recorders of data -- reporters . Mr. Kouwenhoven points out that only with the rise of the genre painters in the eighteen-forties do the figures in a drawing become individuals rather than types . But it is also true that not until that time does anyone expect the artist to put into a scene the people who everyone knows are there . It is possible to regard this as a defect in the historical instrument , but also it contains the raw material of a serious fallacy which the historian must bear in Blind . If he does not , he will compound it . Thus , as Mr. Kouwenhoven remarks , for a long- time the visual record of New York is dominated by the waterfront . It would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's eastward orientation , its outlook toward Europe , and its transatlantic commerce . Even when the pictures begin to face westward , it is only toward rural uptown landscapes sentimentalized as peaceful retreatsfor metropolitans , and we do not look as far as Croton till the water mains are built . The suggestion might he that the city was unconcerned with its own corporate frontier , the interior of the colony , or the wasteland beyond . But this is a gap in the pictorial record . Other records fill the gap : to merchants , mechanics , tradesmen , and professional men the coastwise commerce was at /east as important as that which crossed to the Indies or Europe . The site of the city was no more important as the terminus of the seaway than as the mouth of the Hudson , that is as the gateway to the interior . From the earliest years Albany and the Great Lakes sent wealth to the city ; the business interests of the Livingstons and their circle extended to Buffalo , those of the Astors to the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Among many reasons , two : the pre-occupations of pictorial artists and the nature of the market in which they sold their wares . aris-rs become before A the invention of photography , but their scope widens progressively after they get a camera to work with . Before that time there has been plenty of interest in commerce and trade and a naive awe before the symbols of commercial wealth . But before the camera little attention has been paid to the processes of commerce as distinguished from its symbols , less to its mechanisms , and almost none to its machines . The pictorialization of industry lags far behind industrial development , and until our own time industry is mostly treated as spectacle . There can have been no lack of a market from the middle of the nineteenth century on . We must suspect another subjective pitfall and it is probably class-consciousness or aesthetic snobbery . It is also a striking fact that with photography illustration suddenly becomes more convincing . Now not only can a camera be made to lie as much as the photographer may desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or report some facts , more completely than a photograph . There may be some residual distrust of any visual statement , and some unconscious assumption that one made by a lens is not corrupted by human intervention . Is this wiihin Mr. Kouwenhoven 's constant reminder that a picture is someone 's way of looking at something ? Not altogether , I think . There also enters into it an awareness , formulated or not , that a picture can not record an event . It can look at an arrested moment of an event , it can comment on an event and sometimes interpret one , but it can not convey one for it must leave out too much ? including dine , sequence , and development . In Mr. Kouwenhoven 's Portrait there is a great variety of fires , wrecks , cave-ins , riots , assaults , athletic contests , elections , and other actions in the course of occurring ? not to mention successive stages of actions which occur over long periods of time . But by themselves they must be called designs and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absolute abstraction . They splendidly illustrate history and they contribute to its course but they do not record it by themselves . T HAT , I think , is the fixed limita- ion of the graphic instrument which history is now , and so very belatedly , trying to make use of . It adds a visual dimension to the past , but it does not of itself give the historian movement or even con-1 tent . And without content it must remain ? for the reader , not the historian ? a kind of spectacle . No one has ever worked harder than Mr. Kouwenhoven , if anyone else has worked so hard , to fuse the picture and the text till they become inseparable . His text is never more than a few words , printed at the top of the page ? for the much longer captions of the pictures are footnotes and bibliography . But this text is what transforms pictorial documents , which differ only in the nature of the medium from such traditional documents as archives and personal papers , into the substance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of pictures , the instrument will increase in subtlety and sophistication , but it will still be static and , apart from the text , without content . The graphic instrument , then , is for the historian ; all the reader can make of it is a picture book .
