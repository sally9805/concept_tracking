By definition , it was no news when a snake bit a man in St. Joseph , Mo . a fortnight ago , and little more newsworthy when , thanks to antisnakebite serum , the man recovered . But last week the snake made news : it died as a result of the bite it had inflicted . <P> An Indian hooded cobra , it bit the hand of William White . 32 , a professional snake handler in a reptile garden . Serum flown from Miami by Air Force jet saved White . But the cobra 's fangs were loosened by the heavy burlap bag through which it struck , and its jaw was dislocated when White jerked his hand away . Infection of the injured mouth killed the snake .
