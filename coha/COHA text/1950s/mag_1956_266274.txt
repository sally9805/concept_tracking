By any system of scoring , Russia ran off with the seventh Winter Olympics . In the unofficial arithmetic of sideline experts , the Soviets won with 121 points . Second : Austria , 78 third : Finland , 66 . But strangely , it was a group of grim and driving U.S. females known in Cortina as " the Skating Mothers " who had the most to cheer about . Like mothers of most virtuosos , they drove their children hard , with fierce jealousy of their rivals . " They look like women who were born 150 years too late , " said one newsman . " Otherwise . they would have been shouldering Madame Defarge away from her front seat at the guillotine . " But the fierce ambition of the Skating Mothers paid off . In the midst of defeat in other events , the U.S. could still salve its pride with the lilting skill of Tenley Albright and Hayes Alan Jenkins , of Ronald Robertson and Carol Heiss , the spectacular figure skaters who swept past all opposition . <P> The precise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first gold medal . No sooner had the strains of The Star-Spangled Banner faded away than the Colorado stylist was all but forgotten . Accompanied only by his proud mother and his brother David ( who finished third , behind California 's Robertson ) , he hiked back through bitter cold to his hotel . No one had thought to send a car . Now everyone was worried about honey-haired Tenley Albright , the hard-luck kid from Newton , Mass . Only two weeks before , she had gashed her right ankle in a practice accident . <P> But Tenley Albright thrives on trouble . She started skating in the first place to speed her recovery from childhood polio . Poised and sure in her dark rose sweater , red flowers bright against her bobbed blonde hair , she swung into her free-skating routine . Gliding to the beat of a bright Offenbach medley , she picked up speed and leaped into a stag ( a twisting jump in which the skater takes off backwards , turns , and sails forward , back arched and trailing leg extended ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenley whirled through her complicated routine . Axels , splits , cross-foot spins were all combined in a daring dance . Only once did her bad ankle seem to buckle , but she recovered quickly . Judges gave her an almost perfect score . <P> Closest competition came from Long Island 's Carol Heiss , 16 . Blonde pony tail flying , she missed out by the narrowest of margins in the rigid requirements of school figures . " We call her the bridesmaid , " said Carol 's disappointed mother . " Always second to Tenley. "
