What the Japanese Baptists need , thinks Andrew Quincy Allen of Dallas , the Texas Baptists have got . Last week he arrived in Tokyo to give them some of it . <P> Andrew Allen , 52 , is a precise and practical man , with a windburned complexion and a flat drawl ; he became Sunday school secretary of the Texas Baptist Convention in 1949 , and since then has worked out his own theory of how to do his job . " Small units , " he says crisply . " The small unit concept is what has built the Texas Sunday school system , and Sunday school is our best evangelistic opportunity . You build a church by building the Sunday school . When you reach people in Sunday school and teach them the Bible , you get the money ; they want to expand the kingdom of God . " <P> The next step , says Allen , is " visitation . You could have beautiful buildings and train your teachers until they were Ph.D.s , but if you did n't get out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would n't get them to church . You can come and visit one of our classes , and then two or three of the members will be out to visit you the next week , instead of just saying , ' We 're glad to have you . ' We are glad to have you , and we 're coming out after you . " <P> With Dr. William L. Howse of Nashville , an official of the Southern Baptist Convention , Allen has begun a three-week tour to expound his Sunday school building ideas to Japanese Baptists , also plans to conduct clinics and conferences in Hong Kong , Java , Korea and the Philippines under the sponsorship of the Baptist General Convention of Texas and the Southern Baptist Convention . <P> " In Japan , " says Allen , " they feel that Sunday school is too childlike . Part of my task is to try and help them see it is not childlike , but manly and womanly . We 're going to try to get them to understand our idea of the teacher , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best teaching without knowing the problem of the pupil-visiting him in his home , learning about his personal life , his family life , his recreational life , his business life . They also have to see the importance of many rooms . You ca n't reach a five-year-old girl in the same room with a 50-year-old man . If they follow our advice , they ca n't help growing . " Japan now has 65 Southern Baptist churches and about 8,000 members . Allen says confidently that with Texas Baptist techniques the Japanese can have 1,000 churches and 100,000 members within the next 25 years . <P> After only a few days of Texan Allen 's ingratiating techniques , Japanese Baptists were impressed . Said one Tokyo pastor : " We 're going to have to shift gears in our thinking . "
