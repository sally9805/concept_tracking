Old soldiers faded a little faster early in World War II , when the Army announced that its traditional four-regiment , two-brigade divisions would give way to streamlined , speedier , three-regiment units . Last week the old soldiers of even the wartime triangular divisions received a shock . Adjusting to atomic strategy and tactics , the Army announced a complete reorganization of 18 active divisions along the lines of its 19th , the " pentomic " 101st Airborne Division . <P> Under radically different tables of organization and equipment still being drawn up , the regiments of all 18 divisions during the next two years will be reformed into five smaller combat groups ( pent ) that can group quickly for major-division operations and disperse as quickly to escape atomic retaliation ( - omic ) . To increase mobility , heavy artillery and rockets will be reassigned to corps or armies . <P> Though the reorganization will trim the strength of airborne divisions by one-third , and of infantry divisions by almost one-fifth , the Pentagon emphasized two points : 1 ) the plan does not lower the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future draft calls ; 2 ) the changeover is no experiment in disarmament . Then , for old soldiers , a humane third point was added : history-rich regimental colors and numbers will somehow be preserved even in the pentomic age .
