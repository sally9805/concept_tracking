txt Delegates from Louisiana , South Carolina and Virginia exulted last night after the Democratic national convention voted to seat the Virginians , even tho they refused to sign the controversial party loyalty pledge . The jubilation was increased after the convention , in another prolonged episode , admitted both Louisiana and South Carolina . Thus , altho they would not meet the letter of the loyalty oath , the three southern commenwealth delegations will participate fully in further business of the convention . The resounding defeat handed proponents of the pledge brought ' the following comment from Sen. Harry F. Byrd of Virginia : " We fought a clean fight and we won a clean victory . We refused to sign any pledge , and we still do . If we had had our way , we 'd have had all three states voted on at one time , instead of Virginia only . " Maybank Shouts Jubilantly Near the end of the interminably long roll call , when it became apparent that an earlier tide wag ' being reversed and Virginia 's delegates would be seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisle to his colleague , Sen. Pat McCarran of Ne-vada : " We 're going to win , Pat  --  and we should . We 're all Democrats . " One imperturbable figure during the wrangling and the see-sawing roll call was Gov . James F. Byrnes of South Carolina , former senator , Supreme court justice , and secretary of state . With the aplomb of an old political hand , Byrnes sat impassive as some of the more excitable members of his delegation fidgeted , counted votes feverishly , squirmed , and gave vent to their indignation . Laughs Over South Dakotans The one good laugh Byrnes had as the hours rolled along was when the South Dakota delegation provided the comic relief by walking out  --  then walking back again . The veteran South Carolinian took his delegation on a walkout Wednesday and was prepared to do it again , it was believed , had the convention refused to seat the Virginians . Another calm listener was Gov . John Battle of Virginia , who wore an easy smile even when it appeared that the large northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies . Vowed Not to Compromise With the vote lopsided against him , Battle told reporters : " There will be no compromise . We could n't go back to Virginia if we compromised . We have n't been defeated ; we did n't make this motion . " The motion to seat Virginia came from the Maryland delegation . Battle , tall , grey , and 60 , sagged a little when his delegation 's fortunes were at their lowest ebb on the roll call , but straightened and widened his grin when the tables were turned . Several Virginians were heard to mutter during the low point , " Well , if they throw us out , they 'll be sorry in November . " The defection of Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana , who signed the loyalty pledge and spoke in its behalf during the long session , did not surprise his fellow Louisiana Democrats because he and Gov . Robert F. Kennon have had a long political feud . Maybank Spurns Offer While Long was speaking and waving his arms in a fashion reminiscent of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard to say disgustedly , " There 's a little punk I put on my committee . " In the early stages of the roll call , an unidentified man , apparently a messenger from someone in power , rushed to the South Carolina delegation and was heard saying to Maybank : " We 'll make it easy for you . " " I wo n't sign anything , " Maybank barked at him . Gov . Kennon held the same position all day , and there were reports that Mississippi also would have walked out if the three states had been ousted . DIXIE TALKS OF IKE Before the Democratic convention had its showdown on the loyalty issue last night , dissident southern Democrats had been talking about supporting Gen. Eisenhower , the Republican Presidential nominee . Leaders and members of the Louisiana , South Carolina , and Virginia delegations yesterday afternoon frankly said they believed the party had treated them outrageously and that their traditional Democratic partisanship was fading away . " The labor skates , the crooks , and the communist fellow travelers now control what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina . " There 's nothing for us to do but go back home and agree on some Presidential electors who would cast their votes for Eisenhower . I regret it more than I can say , but we have no choice . " " All Loyal to Jimmy " Other South Carolinians joined in these sentiments but asked that in deference to their leader , Gov . James F. Byrnes , they be unidentified . " We 're all loyal to Jimmy , " one said , " and we do n't want it to appear that we are going off on our own trail until the convention is over . Who knows , Jimmy may join us for Eisenhower . " Another delegate added : " We know how to put South Carolina behind Eisenhower . When our people realize that the party they once were proud of has shucked them off and betrayed them , they 'll join us . " Louisiana Hedges Louisiana delegates would not say they would vote for Eisenhower but they would n't say they would never vote for him . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except possibly a few of them ; not snore than one or two on some occasion  --  who ever voted the Republican ticket , " said Sherwood R. Loe of Shreveport , delegation vice chairman . Asked whether he might vote for Eisenhower in November if the Democrats nominated a Yankee liberal , Loe said , " That I could n't say . " Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana said : " My impression is that some of the delegation have in mind that they might put the Republican nominee on the ballot as the Democratic candidate in my state . " Sees Chance for Ike Delegate Frank Stone of Matthew , Va. , expressed belief Eisenhower could carry Virginia if the state does n't approve the Democratic nominee . Two other delegates , George Grove and Charles Fenwick , both of Arlington , Va. , disagreed . " Ike was a good soldier , but he would make a poor President , " Grove said . " I 'll haste to go along with the Democratic nominee , no matter who he is , and so will most other Virginians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic ticket and wo n't change his vote .
