Convict Joseph Holmes liked music . Every day from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. , the loudspeakers in Maryland 's State Penitentiary blared out radio programs for the prisoners ' entertainment , and Holmes scraped away at his tunnel . The radio drowned out the noise . <P> Holmes , a slender , 39-year-old Negro , had loosened a piece of slate on the floor under the bunk in his cell . Then he chipped patiently through ten inches of concrete , burrowed diagonally downward for ten feet and leveled off under the massive stone wall . He kept digging , tunneled on under a dry moat , then turned upward again . He had 26 feet to go to reach the surface . <P> He dug with bits of scrap iron stolen from the prison workshop . Crawling painfully along the cramped tube , he carried the dirt out in his clothes and flushed it down the cell toilet . Midway , fresh-water seepage formed a narrow chamber high enough for a man to stand in . He matted it with old clothes and rags to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. from his cell and ten years from completing his 20-year stretch for burglary , Convict Holmes broke through in a grassy plot outside the prison walls , hopped over a 7-ft. picket fence , and disappeared into the surrounding city of Baltimore . Nobody missed him until next morning , when a guard checked a motionless lump on Holmes ' bunk . It was a wadded blanket and a pillow .
