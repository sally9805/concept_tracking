The Tweedledum and Tweedledee of Soviet journalism-Izvestia ( Information ) , the official daily of the government , and Pravda ( Truth ) , the official daily of the Communist Party-are so packed with pap and propaganda that a few editors have discreetly hinted recently that the two dailies are incredible bores ( TIME , June 1 ) . Last week brought a sign that the government had at last decided to print some news that is fit to be read . Named as the new managing editor of Izvestia : round-cheeked Aleksei I. Adzhubei , garrulous and gregarious as his father-in-law , who happens to be Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev . <P> Adzhubei 's appointment is no nepotistic caper . At 34 he is one of Russia 's most talented journalists ; as editor , he pumped readability into Komsomolskaya Pravda , the Communist youth organ , by ordering firsthand factual reporting on the Russian scene , crusading against erring officials ( e.g. , a garage manager who had wrongly fired a worker ) . He helped to push Komsomolskaya Pravda 's circulation from 1.500,000 five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. in 1955 , Adzhubei refused to answer tough questions from American newsmen about Russia , but generally radiated good will , quipped as he made a small wager at a Reno gambling table : " I probably should n't do this-I might make a million . " ( He did n't . ) As editorial boss of Izvestia ( circ. 1,800,000 ) . Adzhubei may some day give the monolithic Pravda ( 5,560,000 ) a run for its kopecks.
