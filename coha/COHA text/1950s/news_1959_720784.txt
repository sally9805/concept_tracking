txt The most stringent and austere defense budget since ' the end of the Korean war confronts the armed services ! ' in the next fiscal year , which begins July 1 , 1960. lslajor , cutbacks , limitations and socalled stretchouts are already ' being projected , even though the final budget figures are not likely to be approved by the President until December . Under discussion are a 20 , - 000-man , forty-ship reduction for the Navy 's operating forces ; a 20,000-man reduction and a $2,500,000,000 cut in procurement for the Air Force ; a rigid limitation of procurement of new weapons and equipment for the Army . and a reduction in civilian personnel employed by the Department of Defense . Also at stake between now and next spring is the fate of the Army 's Nike-Zeus antiballistic missile program . ? Missile Age Is Factor The unusually severe impact of the forthcoming budget on the armed services is due to several factors . The most important is the heavy hand of the Bureau of the Budget . The dollar " guide lines " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the defense budget level of the current fiscal year and last year , or about $40,000,000,000 . Defense Department officials believe it is impossible to make the extensive technological transition to the missile and nuclearpower age and still maintain the force levels of the services at current strength if . the " levelbudget concept " is maintained . An almost equally important factor is the expenditure limitations clamped on the services during the last three years and most rigidly during the current year . This executive method of controlling spending means that , regardless of the amount of funds provided or authorized by Congress , the services ' actual disbursements and expenditures can total only a specified limited amount each year . The ceiling on expenditures has been so rigid that it is now commencing to squeeze all the services severely . In effect it means that the , services are having to use most of the ready cash released to them to pay for past and current bills . There is little left over to order new arms or equipment . Another factor is inflation and the ever-increasing costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimating on the final price tags of new planes , ships and missiles . The Navy will be particularly affected in the next budget by gross underestimates in the past on the costs of some of its new ships , especially the nuclear-powered carrier Enterprise and the nuclear-powered cruiser Long Beach , both under construction . A final factor that has added materially to the usual pains and difficulties of budget formulation is the demand of Rep.esentative George H. Mahon , Democrat of Texas , for a new kind of " functional " budget . He has asked the Defense Department to tabulate , titemize and identify manpower , major equipment , forces and costs of the armed services , regardless of duplication , under six main headings . The so-called functions he wants " costed and appraised " are those suggested earlier this year to Mr. Mahon 's House Appropriations subcommittee on defense by Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor , retired , who was then Chief of Staff of the Army . The six categories , which cut across service lines , are : 1 . Atomic retaliatory forces ( identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . 3 . Strategic reserve forces . 4 . Overseas forces . 5 . Forces guarding sea and air - line of communications , including anti-submarine warfare forces . 6 . Reserve forces , including National Guard and organized Reserves . Since most of these functions overlap and some or all of the men and equipment utilized for one of these functions are also capable of utilization for other functions , the problem of identitabtilating and " costing " has the Pentagon in a tizzy . The ( final decision on the exact shape of the defense budget for the year starting next July 1-is not expected until after the return to Washington about Oct. 30 of the Secretary of Defense , Neil H. . He is on a trip to the Pacific and the Far East . As things stand now the limiting factors cited are expected to have the following effects : AIR FORCE In addition to a 20,000-man reduction and a possible reduction in the number of medium bombers operated by the Strategic Air Command , the Air Force has informed industry to expect cuts , limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to $2,500,000,000 in new obligational authority requested will bring , in effect , a rigid limitation on the placement of orders for new equipment . The development of the huge supersonic B-70 bomber may be continued but will be delayed , Reductions in procurement of the Boeing B-52 and the Convair B-58 bombers and in the Atlas and Titan intercontinental ballistic missiles are expected . In the case of the Atlas , the Pentagon is now talking in terms of a program of " more than ten " squadrons of ten missiles each . The original program was nine squadrons , but Congress at its last session appropriated more than the President had requested for the Atlas and indicated that the Air Force should procure eight more squadrons , or a total of seventeen . However , a study af the possibility of " hardening " and dispersing all Atlas missile-launching sites is now tinder way and some of the funds may be used for this purpose instead of for the procurement of all of the added missiles . Hardening of the missilelaunching sites would involve putting them entirely or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The future of the Titan is complicated by an impending decision on whether it should be modified in development to utilize so-called storable , or package liquid ? propellants , which have the advantage of reducing the . count-down , or reaction time , required prior to launching .. ' NAVY Various alternatives for the Navy budget are under consideration . One of them has postulated the reduction of the Navy by about 40,000 men and eighty operating ships . The more probable program , however , contemplates a 20,000-man cut and an austere plane , missile and ship-building p ? ogram under discussion envisages a modernization and conversion gram . This shipbuilding p ? oprogram for seven or eight old ships and the start of fourteen new ones . The Navy is expected to ask for more funds for a second nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . Funds to procure longlead-time items for this carrier were provided by Congress for this fiscal year . Four new destroyers and two or three nuclear-powered Polaris submarines are also being considered for next year . A decision whether to convert the cruiser Bremerton to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000,000 is not yet final . The Navy 's research and development budget is expected to be strictly curtailed and the prospects are that there will not be enough funds to initiate many new projects . MARINE CORPS The strength of the corps , now about 175,000 men , is likely to remain at this level , despite the fact that Congress appropriated funds at the last session to increase it to 200,000 . ARMY The most , severe impact on the Army will he in procurement , where a $700,000,000 reduction front this year is under discussion , and in research and development . Enough funds are not expected to be available even to equip all our forces in Europe with the new NATO cartridge and the new Army rifle , much less to buy new heavy equipment . If the contemplated limitations are finally approved , funds for starting any new research and development projects in 1961 will be almost nonexistent . The Nike-Zeus anti-ballisticmissile program presents a special case , This defense weapons system is still in development . Its total ultimate cost is placed at $9,200,000.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of batteries planned . The first actual intercept test of the Nike-Zeus , to be fired from Kwajalein Island in the Pacific against a missile launched from Johnston Island , is not scheduled until the summer of 1962 . But if the NikeZeus is to be operational as rapidly as possible , the production of long lead-time items , the pooling of factories and so on must start soon . Congress appropriated about $137.000,000 at its last session to start preparations for producing long lead-time electronic production items . This money has not been obligated and under present plans a decision on whether to spend it will not be reached until next April 1 . Army experts believe that unless more production funding of at least $500.000,000 is available for Nike-Zeus in the 1961 budget there is no use spending the $137,000,000 already authorized in the 1960 budget It will buy no time . Between now and April 1 , 1960 , a thorough Defense Department study and analysis of the whole Nike-Zeus program is planned . It will be based in part on short-range tests of Nike-Zeus components at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies to be made between now and April 1 are adjudged favorable by the Defense ? Department and the White House , production funds will be requested in a supplementary budget request after April 1 . If the analysis Is not favorable , Nike-Zeus may be canceled or continued for development purposes only .
