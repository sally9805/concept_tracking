txt  | selves by virtue of an intrinsic evidence or charm , wherever these can be felt , and neither the pure philosopher nor the pure artist makes any effort to impose his thoughts willynilly upon people too stupid or too differently endowed to understand them . Fanatics , on the contrary , can not be content to wait , and find their genuine friends where nature has bred them . They can not afford to let their seed grow and their prophecies fulfill themselves by the moving equilibrium of physical forces . It is the essence of fanaticism to be impatient and to demand that nothing should ever exist anywhere contrary to a utopian regimen adopted in idea , without patent means of realising it either in the world at large , or even in the lives or habitual feelings of the enthusiasts themselves . The fanatic is a tyrant on principle , and often a hypocrite in practice . He can not exercise the art of government , even over himself , in a frank manly way , with sympathy and understanding for the forces which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding would seem to him the deepest treason , a temptation of the devil still troubling his soul ; and he will whip himself up to hate and to revile all that side of his own nature which , perhaps wisely , he has decided to sacrifice . He is in hot haste ; and he fosters injustice in his heart as a necessary virtue . There is an evident impurity in this moral condition , a mixture of ideal interests ( which , however absorbing , are always disinterested ) with a profound physical unrest and insecurity , an urgent need of being victorious , to hide the secret suspicion of having been wrong . This impurity is mirrored in the method by which fanaticism endeavours to maintain and to spread itself . The thoughts to be conveyed are not allowed to recommend themselves only by their own clearness or eloquence , nor the virtues by their intrinsic dignity or sweetness . Loudness and repetition , eulogy , personal influence , affections , self-interest , and vilification of all things else are employed also . It is hoped that social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canalise the spontaneous course of ideas . The ancient Jews and the Moslems , though we sometimes call them fanatics , were not yet hypocrites , because their enthusiasm was frankly national and warlike ; they formed , in their own eyes , an elite predestined to conquer and rule all other peoples , without necessarily assimilating them ; so that in their ideas , Moslems at least were not always intolerant or tyrannical , but only a little  | contemptuous , like Epicureans , towards the delusions of dirtier and more slavish sects . Their fanaticism was only political , and based on a childish simplification of human nature and history , like the fanaticism of modern liberals . They thought that galloping over endless deserts and then , in the cool moonlight , making verses and making love , fulfilled man 's highest destiny . This was hardly a faith to impose but rather a model to exhibit , a beautiful poem to exhale once more , before nobleness should vanish from the earth . In a biological view the agencies that control ideas are always ultimately physical : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passions and employments in particular men . But in so far as these forces have already gone to form the psyche , and to make man what he is inwardly prompted to become , he adopts these forces for his own . He is the synthesis and voice of those vital currents ; and what those forces do or tend to do in him and through him is his own free and only possible work . If all his neighbours share the same endowment as himself , there may be competition in pursuing the same goods which everybody desires but which , unless they are spiritual goods , everybody can not obtain ; but this rivalry in ambition and action will not imply any diversity in ideas . On the contrary , everybody will stimulate everybody else by proposing and perhaps realising the common model . In the tightest tribal dogmatism and morality there need then be nothing forced , or imposed from without . Even the criminal or deserter will inwardly blame his momentary madness , and regard his punishment as just . But such unanimity is precarious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and the beginnings of new types come to the surface , and perhaps vast revolutionary movements , like epidemics , may threaten to set people talking and acting in entirely new ways . It is then that propaganda is appealed to , and in both camps ; in the conservative camp to burnish up the old ideas , and inspire horror for the new ; in the revolutionary camp , to discredit everything traditional , and paint some untried alternative in brilliant colours . Yet the difference between the two parties is less profound than it might seem . Propaganda must be speculative : mere cold facts would miss fire . One party , the young party , cries that the kingdom of heaven is at hand . The other , the old party , whispers that the kingdom of heaven is come already , that it is something spiritual , and exists within us . But this makes wretched propaganda ,  | and must be supplemented .

" VICISSITUDES OF FAITH LOYALTY to clan or monarch and religious or political faith , however intense or rapturous , have an insecure tenure in the moral nature of man . The doctrinaire who for this reason turns upon human nature and calls it sinful or corrupt may be right metaphysically , but his conviction that he is right should give him no confidence that he can force his particular system upon mankind . He may pile controversial proof or may organise a dogmatic education like the Catholic Church or the Russian State and proclaim inexorable laws , like the Pentateuch , the Koran , or the Medes and Persians . Indomitable aliens will still surround and resist him . His own children will whisper incessant heresies ; his very soul will trouble him with doubts or with treacherous extensions of orthodoxy ; and nothing he can do will prevent the ground from crumbling under his feet , and the world from moving on to some other unexpected convention .

Even the traditional system imposed upon him , with time , changes its spirit . Every new definition of dogma , every fresh regulation , slightly changes the tone and the living upshot of the whole . Therefore , whoever frames political or religious or aesthetic systems ought not to expect to see them long carried out or widely accepted as their authors conceive them . They must reckon with their host , with the unaccountable , ever young , irresponsible individual . His name is legion ; his imagination and his instincts are subject to spontaneous variation , and while he will doubtless always remain subject to panic influences ,  | to social suasion , and to tribal enthusiasm , these subtle contagions will never be quite the same .

Chance impulses are like a hoop which outruns the child that has set it rolling ; its very speed condemns it , when left to itself , to meander and to flop . If , on the contrary , the impulse is an adopted one , and needs to be reawakened , it is more likely to be maintained ; for its cause recurs .

A missionary sermon is an unprovoked attack ; it seeks to entice , to dictate , to browbeat , to disturb , and to terrify ; it ends , if it can , by grafting into your heart , and leaving to fructify there , an alien impulse , the grounds of which you do not contain understand , and the consequences of which you never have desired . That which preaching tries to do openly other hypnotic influences do more efficaciously by indirect suggestion . It is admitted that the flame of faith needs to be kept going artificially ; it will die down if for a moment you stop blowing the bellows . Leave the natural man to himself and he would forget or transform your legends , fetch a morality for himself out of his heart and his social experience , and speculate on the basis not of what tales he had heard but of what facts he had encountered .

To preserve an illusion it must be linked to something in the real world ; at least to a phrase , if possible to a place and to  | a ceremony . Even then the illusion will flicker , because its relation to waking belief will remain vague ; but this very uncertainty may lend it passionate interest . Controversy will rage about it until science or theology defines it dogmatically . Then the alien dominance of it , as if it were a fact , will be overt and confessed . It will seem a crime or an absurdity to call it in question , so interwoven will it now be with public opinion , convention , and sentiment ; until at length some fine morning the enormity of that hoary usurpation strikes upon the soul . Then the astonished dupe rubs his eyes and touches his own body to make sure that he is awake , that the objects of his consciousness are at last actually its causes ; and he marvels how all his life he has been walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy society the public instinctively runs to help the police ; the criminal is felt to be everybody 's enemy ; there is an implicit brotherhood amongst peaceful citizens , who if attacked may confidently cry Help , help , or Stop thief . And the moral principle behind this ready cooperation is that no one ought to be a public enemy ; that crime ought to be extirpated ; and that the police , save for some involuntary error , is always right . It follows that the police can not be too strong in respect to possible disorderly elements ; it ought to be so obviously irresistible , and so supported by universal sentiment , that disorder should not dare to show its face , and that the very idea and possibility of rebellion to the law should be absent from the public mind . This is the light in which contemporary sentiment sometimes would look upon war . Nations , like good citizens , ought to keep the peace ; and armies should be simply police forces at the disposal of an international tribunal . A war would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry Stop thief , if any nation ventured to run amok . By a curious irony of fate , at the very moment when this view is being advanced , and a pretentious international tribunal ( though  | without real jurisdiction or armed force ) had actually been estabished in the League of Nations and , when it crumbled , has been reconstructed with even greater elaboration and folly ? at this very moment the laws of war have collapsed , and peoples glare at each other in absolute hate and terror , like crouching beasts in the jungle . Wars were not formerly regarded as crimes ; they might indeed be begun unjustly or waged cruelly ; and this would be criminal precisely because unnecessary and contrary to the true function of war . What was this function ? The maintenance of the rights and liberties of some social organism , a state or city or family or even an individual . These rights and liberties had been established and proclaimed boldly , and you clung to them with the same pride and courage with which you would defend your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these rights and liberties , that others might have rights and liberties of their own , which it would be their duty to defend . You had no right to assault them , unless they assaulted you . The aggressor , the trespasser , would be a villain ? a man who trampled on the rights of others , having no true idea of right . But if by some unfortunate combination of circumstances , the true rights and liberties of two states or cities or men collided , then both were right in defending themselves by force ; and war was the judgment of Heaven between them . In practice , no doubt , neither side in ancient wars was apt to be blameless ; and the definition of rights and liberties , being made by each party for itself , would hardly help being biassed and fantastic ; yet the nominal appeal was always to justice , and the enemy rights and liberties were recognised to be valid , in so far as they were justly maintained . War was therefore an appeal to God to give the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inordinate ambition , and to restore both to their true liberties and rights . This was the spirit of chivalry . A chivalrous war was not incompatible with personal disinterestedness or with Christian charity . A man 's rights and liberties were a trust ; and in going forth to punish injustice the knight errant not only did his duty and vindicated his honour , but could be merciful to the evildoer , once restored to his true place , where a just and religious life was possible for him . So to vindicate one 's rights and liberties was a matter of honour , like defending one 's body against a blow . If anyone preferred to let himself be kicked ,  | he was either a saint or a coward ; and in both cases the man of honour was bound to step in , repel the aggressor , protect the saint , and kick the coward again for having deserted the cause of justice . Even to the enemy , if the enemy too was a man of honour , consideration was fitting . Chivalrous wars were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory and often in the conviction of both parties , wars to maintain the right ; and , justice once restored , your enemy could become your friend not merely because there was now material peace between the two , but because there had always been at bottom between them a certain mutual sympathy and equality in honour . The war had been an incidental duel , fought under accepted rules , within Christian limits , announced with eloquent indictments and counter-charges , and sanctified by sacramental oaths ; and the tilt , if decisive , could establish a new recognised right with new duties mutually accepted . All this chivalrous sentiment could not change the foundations of human nature or of natural necessity , only at best add a touch of imagination and nobleness to men 's minds . Wars were not often begun purely for justice 's sake , or prosecuted with courtesy : ambition and love of gain , hot anger and stubbornness played as usual the leading parts ; and the name of right often covered insatiable lusts which included a lust for war and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalry that the gentry should go about armed , and always fighting with no great ultimate settlement in view . In contrast with this chivalrous skirmishing , fanatical or materialistic wars appear more rational , in that they look to radical and final issues ; by exterminating the enemy they propose to clear the air and to make a harmonious world seem , for the moment , attained or attainable . Perhaps if the Crusades and the wars of the Reformation had not been fought by chivalrous princes , the results might have been more decisive ; but the leaders were often distracted by personal and incidental interests from their nominal religious mission ; they did not hesitate to ally themselves on occasion with infidels or heretics against men of their own faith . This faith , after all , was not chivalrous ; it had absolute pretensions , profoundly hostile to knightly freedom of fancy , of self-will , and of spontaneous allegiance ; and very likely these lords in their lordly minds were impatient of priests and legal pedants deafening them with arguments . They believed in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt a chivalrous sympathy with a like lordliness in others . Chivalry was something romantic ; the knight had a private adventurous conscience of his own ; and his imagination demanded , and was not sorry to create , a picturesque medley of attachments . In one respect , indeed , the ideal essence of chivalry never was obscured by either religious or worldly influences : the knight always preferred death to dishonour . Death he daily defied ; at every turn of a corner , in every retort , in every love affair , his hand went to the hilt of his sword . When death is habitually defied , all the slavery , all the vileness of life is defied also . It belonged almost to the pride and joy of life to hold life cheap , and risk it , and be coolly indifferent to losing it , in defence of the least of one 's rights and liberties . A smiling and mystic neighbourliness with death , as with one 's own shadow , intensified life enormously in the dramatic direction ; it kept religion awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , to fashionable swagger ; and it concentrated the whole gamut of human passion and fancy within each hour . Shakespeare 's theatre ( not to speak of the Spanish ) is a living monument to the mentality of chivalry . In contrast with that freedom and richness we can see to what a shocking degradation modern society has condemned the spirit . There can be no doubt of it : chivalry is now thoroughly dead . Our one preoccupation is to be safe . We do n't know what we love , or if we do we do n't dare mention it . We are willing to become anything , to be turned into any sort of worm , by the will of the majority . We are afraid of starving , of standing alone ; above all we are afraid of having to fight . And when nevertheless we are forced to fight , we do so without chivalry . We do not talk of justice , but of interests . We have become very numerous , we have established a great many industries , we have encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this has to be maintained , it has a great momentum , which we can not resist . And we need our neighbour 's land and markets and colonies ; at least we need a strip along their borders , so as to be able to expand a little , and to breathe . For as it is , we are dreadfully crowded and insecure and unhappy . If only more people spoke our language and were governed by our government , we somehow believe we might be less crowded , less insecure , and less unhappy ; as if it made any essential difference whether 20 million more people read the  | same newspaper , and thought and said the same thing at the same moment . Is there in this megalomania a remnant of imitation of religious propaganda ? Is it for the salvation of foreigners ' souls that we wish to annex and to standardise them ? Is it to prevent those who are unlike ourselves from being eternally damned that we long to exterminate them ? Meantime our society has lost its own soul . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great eruption and inundation of brute humanity threatens to overwhelm all the treasures that artful humanity has created . Brute humanity has the power to destroy polite humanity , because it retains the material equipment of modern industry which has recently grown upon man like fresh hide , horns , and claws . Armed with this prodigious mechanism , any hand at headquarters can spread death and ruin over the earth . But whose shall this hand be ? Anybody 's : the first man 's who jumps at the lever , touches the button , and takes possession of the radio . Yes , but this is so easy , so alluring , that more than one man may attempt it at once . Then the really great war , in the modern sense of greatness , would begin . The whole mechanism in one hand would clash with the whole mechanism in another hand . Will they simply blow each other up , and perish together ? Or at the last moment will they agree to pool their machinery and draw lots as to who shall be boss ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only one party survives , and makes an appeal to chance unnecessary ? In any case , it will be a war of extermination establishing an absolute power . There will be no consideration ' of rights or liberties , no talk of honour , and no nonsensical chivalry . REALPOLITIK MACHIAVELLI and his recent emulators can never be judged fairly unless we begin by making a distinction which they have neglected to make between the efficacy of means and the choice of ends : an  | omission which turns their honesty into a scandal . Their insight into the ways of the world is genuine ; and it was honourable in them to face the facts , and to face obloquy in reporting them frankly . Yet it was a true scandal , born of their mixed moral education , Christian and pagan , to confuse the natural history of politics with rational government . It is an old trick . Nurses sometimes say : Little boys never do that ; and the tempter will whisper : Have a cigarette . All the boys smoke . Both assertions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion that what is done is right , and what is not done is wrong . This is a double non sequitur : and apart from logical scruples it is false morality , since much that is done is certainly wrong for its purpose , and much that is purposed is heartless or foolish in itself . This scandal has been aggravated in our day by the demoralising influence that optimism and the worship of evolution exerted in the nineteenth century . Most men are not good , says Machiavelli ; i therefore anyone who wishes to hold his own must learn not to be good on occasion . This would not be evil counsel , if it were not presumed that every man worth his salt will undoubtedly wish to hold his own among bad men , and not rather perish in the effort to make them better : which would not in that case seem a hopeless effort , since human nature , at least in the martyr , would already have proved capable of heroism ; and the virtue native to one man might perhaps be propagated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machiavelli , however , was not thinking of the saints ; and like Thrasymachus and Callicles in Plato , he thought it a matter of course , if not a point of honour , that at least a prince should prefer to be occasionally wicked rather than to be worsted or die : and he seemed to assume ( what Thrasymachus proclaimed loudly ) that it is better to be a wicked prince than not to be a prince at all . But that first assumption ( which is psychological ) is hasty , and the subsequent suggestion ( which is moral ) is false . Now it is just these hasty or false ideas that the worship of evolution introduces into ethics ; for it is then taken for granted that to survive is the mark of excellence , and that the will to live and to dominate is the basis of morals . But the will to live could be the basis of morals only for a brute that had not discovered that he was mortal , and must ultimately fail in that blind effort ; an effort which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I.  | doubt the occasion of much bravery and many labours , but also of many crimes . Meantime , the only rational aim he can pursue is to live in the best possible manner while he does live . Survival is something impossible : but it is possible to have lived and died well . In other words , the good to be attained by good conduct need not be personal or national ; and the function of a civilised government need not be only to preserve itself ( that is but the by-play of office ) nor even to preserve the state ( which though it need not die at an assignable time is always changing its essence ) but rather to redeem human life from vanity and barbarism , even if the agent in this redemption should itself perish . Such an achivement , or even some part or memory of it surviving afterwards , is glory ; and when the ancients said that it was noble to pursue fame , we may hope they meant glory of this sort , for in that case they attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps an unconscious one ) which is morally sound . Convention is not the standard of true virtue ; and if virti ? stands ( as it sometimes seems to do ) for what is naturally admirable and splendid , though carped at by envy , fanaticism , or timidity ? then what we have before us is a genuine moral reform , masquerading as satire or licence or devilry . Probably its promoters have not philosophy enough to perceive that they and not the pharisees or the pedants are the true moralists . But by " naturally admirable " we must not understand prevalent in the animal or vegetable kingdom , or producing some good results ( almost anything has some good results ) at a prodigious expense of cruelty , labour , sorrow , and remorse . By " naturally admirable " we must understand what human nature ( we are not legislating for other creatures ) , when the touchstone of experience has fully tested and developed the quality of it , feels and declares to be admirable . The nature in question must be recognised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as he would be happy in being ; and the value he sets on things must be such as he would set upon them with full knowledge both of them and of himself . Lacking this knowledge , his moral feelings may be warm , but they will be misguided . Misguided , very likely , are the reigning notions of morality ; and in so far as this is the case , the satirist or the scoffer , however offensive his tone may be to polite ears , is a prophet of true goodness , and not a reprobate . He is not proposing an occasional crime , or a general moral anarchy ; on the con-  | trary , it is the conventional moralists that , in the sad name of a mock virtue , are encouraging evil feelings and evil actions . What wickedness , precisely , did Thrasymachus or Callicles , Machiavelli or Nietzsche require of their political heroes ? Was it what a superstitious rabble calls wickedness ? Or was it something that these philosophers themselves in their hearts felt to be wicked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they craved a certain romantic excitement ? The latter , I think , almost exclusively . They were out for mischief ; not seeing clearly nor caring much for what might ensue , but bursting with the desire to smash things generally . They would have ostracised Aristides for being called the Just . They loved above all things the consciousness of their own radicalism and the sense of rising on stilts of insolence above the vulgar crowd . Yet there may have been something more in the background : the smart of some veritable deep injustice , or the light of a better world shining through all this impatience . That a specious idea should tempt people to wickedness ? is that a new thing in morals ? Does not any temptation allure under the guise of good ? Is there not often something charming about the impossible , something it is a pity and a sorrow to miss ? Can it be that these Realpolitiker have forgotten the rudiments of morals , or have never heard of them ? Are these supermen nothing but ill-bred little boys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination : they are only sowing their wild oats . They will have destroyed a great many things that had a good side , all of them transitory by nature and destined in any case to perish . If their domination lasts they will have established a social order on the same old foundations of physical necessities and human accidents ; and they will proceed painfully to unravel the rights and wrongs of their new experiment . The fruits of their revolution will presently form a crust of conservatism round their hearts . The oracular Zarathustra , become prime minister , will sit at his desk in goggles , ringing for one secretary after another , and receiving some financier who insidiously offers him a plum . Poor superman ! As things get rather thick about him , will he regret the happy irresponsible days when , in the legend of a Borgia , he could publicly invite all his rival supermen to a feast , in order to have them poisoned at his table ? Or will he remember how , distracted by the  | heat and nobly fearless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished instead most horribly ? Ah , those bold romantic crimes were not really more satisfactory than the entanglements of this official slavery . Both are vanity . And in that case , what follows ? It follows that these wild ambitions ( though some lovely things may be summoned by them before the mind ) are themselves evil , at least in part ; that to yield to them , in that respect , is foolish as well as wicked ; and that the misguided hero , like a Damocles or like a poor ghost-seeing and witch-haunting Macbeth , will lose his soul in gaining a sorry world , and his wishes , once attained , will horrify him . These are trite maxims , and elementary : but I am talking of children , to children : a pack of young simpletons led by some young scoundrel . THE SENTIMENTAL BANDIT IN WALKING through a Zoological Garden we may admire the dignity of the animals ? except the monkeys and the peering spectators . True , those animals are caged ; if they were free they might make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radically the enemy of all the rest . Here they are artificially prevented from attacking one another ; yet the intense way they have of burrowing or prowling or pecking expresses clearly enough the absoluteness of their will . Their noble indifference lasts only as long as their digestion : if all is well within , all is well or nonexistent without . But at the call of hunger or lust or fear , the brave war of each atom begins against the universe ; and the universe itself is so tolerant and so indifferent that it suffers the brave atom , sometimes , to win . A curious complication arises in the absolute will when it becomes sentimental . Are the lower animals , the vultures or the bisons , ever sentimental ? They seem so at times : as if the infinite vacuity of a world that does n't concern them made them aware of their own pathetic predicament in having to act as if they were  | important . They must act so , on occasion , with an absolute conviction and ferocity ; but in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , they may dimly feel that the world is as helpless and as innocent as themselves , and they may grow sentimental . For they ca n't change that state of things ; they can only be sorry for their victims , and sorry for themselves at having to victimise them . Such at least , among men , is the sentiment of the romantic criminal . He has reverted to animal war against society ; but he was a social being in childhood ; he remains a social being in respect to his comrades , and to his wife and children ; it is easy for him therefore to extend an impotent benevolence to the people he robs and murders . Poor things , especially if they are young women , and good-looking . He would much prefer to be nice to them ; but his professional duty obliges him to waylay or to gag or perhaps to kill them . It is too bad . His professional duty is far more merciless to him than his heart is to his fellow-creatures . The sentimental bandit is not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch or a general or the founder of a colony , or of a great business enterprise . Sometimes too he is a revolutionary leader , an enthusiastic humanitarian . He is not robbing and murdering for his own benefit ; he is doing it for the greatness of his country or for the emancipation of the poor . He is cruel only in order to dry the people 's tears , or those of a part of the people , or those which he himself has been shedding all his life long at the sight of human misery . Nothing could be nobler than the language and sentiments of such a romantic bandit . His every word is a eulogy . of himself . He talks of his honour : tells you how unjustly fortune has treated him , and how wickedly his enemies have maligned him ; how he has been driven unwillingly to defend himself ; how he detests and despises the decrepit society of which he was a victim ; although he may admit that his own victims personally were sometimes innocent . But invective and apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent in prophecy and self-glorification . The pure will of man , he says , is above all : if you have the gift of commanding you have the right , even the duty , to command ; for the only duty of a free man is that which he imposes upon himself . But ah , what noble storms often agitate his free bosom ! He will confess that in the midst of his hard cruel actions a strange wave of sensibility sometimes over-  | whelms him ; suddenly he will cross himself or say the Lord 's prayer or found a hospital or endow a college . All this , however , will be a passing weakness , unless , like the improbable Don Juan of history , he is sincerely converted and reformed . Absolute Will rejects religion as it rejects chivalry ; it is on the make . The bandit , however sentimental , is not a gentleman crossing swords in a specific quarrel with a particular person , whom he recognises as an equal , with rights and liberties of his own to defend . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles to be kicked out of the way . His avowed art is to take them at a disadvantage . You should never , he says , attack the strong ; that would be foolish and dangerous ; you would be likely to come off crippled even if victorious . And when you think what great losses and sufferings such an equal war might impose , the mere idea of it will become repulsive , and you will make any sacrifice for the sake of peace . The wise , the efficient , the ultimately kind policy is to attack the weak . Then the struggle will be brief , the victims few , and the settlement decisive . The sentimental bandit , or the bandit pure and simple , can seem a hero to children or to awestruck peasants ; they admire his courage , and sympathise with the absolute will let loose in a play world . Yet this benevolence is itself fanciful ; at close quarters and in the long run the sentimental bandit will impose his own absoluteness and lack of chivalry upon his enemies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ; it appeals to a deeper and more universal impulse of animal life . Any absolute asserters of themselves , any other sentimental bandits will be suppressed by him without mercy , hunted down by police-dogs , and thoroughly extirpated like so many rats . Of late we have seen , in art , in war , and in social theory , a rehabilitation of savagery . It is not for me to deny that a great deal of affectation , mere restlessness , and ignorant folly is mixed up in these revivals . They are archaistic and the work of people not savages except by choice . Yet these modish or doctrinaire poses have an instructive side . They remind us that savagery , like every form of animal life , may suddenly be recovered and loved by those in whom it lay latent ; and then free impulse may be defended more hotly than life itself ; because it is less dreadful to die than to live contrary to one 's deepest inclinations .  | THE RAVAGES OF WAR WE READ with horror of the distant ravages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror quickens the pulse and we enjoy it . Even the victims of the disaster , in the midst of distracted efforts to rescue themselves and their possessions , sometimes feel a touch of the same exaltation . The pious regard these evils as the work of God ; and reverence for God is as often increased as diminished by such visitations . Nor are unbelievers , who perhaps have set their hearts on prosperity as the only good , really in a different case . They may attribute their calamities to natural causes , yet when the blow falls , their dismay will not be altogether without incidental satisfactions . Is not science gloriously ready to explain these accidents by universal laws ? Is not international philanthropy quick to relieve them ? Is it not urgent at least to form a committee and discuss the measures that should be first adopted ? Human sentiment in these matters must needs be complex , yet it need not be irresolute or self-contradictory . On the one hand , there is an irrepressible sympathy in every sensitive and clear mind for the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each after its kind . On the other hand there is no less irrepressible insight into natural necessity and the ways of the world . Existence devours itself . Wisdom must expect continual troubles , and in view of them has made ample provision of lightning-rods , lifeboats , firemen , surgeons , hospitals , and cemeteries . The optimist will not fail to add that the existence of vice , crime , and lunacy , so blindly regretted by us , adds several prosperous departments to social administration . It is only in the individual conscience that this conventional equilibrium proves at times insecure , or is upset by some shock particularly terrible or unforeseen . Misfortune may then produce disbelief in God ; yet the notion of a merciless natural order may some day acquire its right of domicle in the mind , becoming axiomatic and even sublime ; and something very like the ancient reverence for the gods will re-establish itself in the heart of the  | atheist . Natural piety has never attempted to moralise the cosmos , but only to recognise in that non-moral natural order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for man and his morality . He is free to incorporate and to turn to moral uses such natural energies as he may learn to control , having in himself , as he has , a spark of that same energy . To the rest he must bow , eluding every fatal contact , and admiring the starry scene from a distance . The ravages of war excite the same horror as do other catastrophes , with this added note : that since the immediate authors and agents in war are men or nations , horror turns into reproaches , indignation , and lasting hostility . Yet this hatred too breaks in the end , like a loud wave on the sand , against the broad indifference of nature and history . If rage is fiercer at being disturbed or thwarted by a man than by some inanimate power , dramatic sympathy with the enemy , when it supervenes , is more rational and more complete . This enemy is a hero in his own eyes , and may ultimately become one in ours . Moreover , he was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blind nature was working irresistibly in us both , at cross purposes with herself . Thus horror at war , intense while Troy burns , sinks in time into the tragic yet courageous emotion with which health always views the evils of life . The ravages of war are immense , and have always been irreparable ; yet we still exist , and are rich and hopeful enough to deprecate any fresh havoc . Even actual war , when it breaks out again , has not altogether a horrible aspect : there is life in the air , if there is death before one 's eyes , or behind one 's back ; and the exalted imagination can not help vaguely disclosing the impartial panorama of history , in which no evil , however horrible , has not causes and conditions that are partly good , and effects that are partly good also . In almost all horror and invective there is in fact a suppressed major premiss invalidating the conclusion which the hot minor premiss , our present passion , would impose . The present evil is truly evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But perception runs easily into idolatry , when it attributes dramatic and moral qualities to diffused natural agencies innocent of any such emotions . We think we are fighting the devil or some wicked race , or some incarnate injustice ; when probably the evils from which we suffer have their roots in the very essence of existence , or in cosmic or biological processes quite beyond human contrivance .  | These evils , in their essence , would have overtaken us in any case . Our real enemy is too large to be seen , being the universe ; or too near , being within ourselves ; and we heap our wrath and hatred on some poor visible agent of destiny , from whom perhaps comes the insult , but not the injury . This is evidently the case with regard to the most deeply lamented of the ravages of war , namely , the loss of life . Death , for the mere animal , is the greatest of evils ; yet it is intimately involved in his structure , since his organism is reproductive , not stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the individual . If he dies in war , or is devoured by some other animal for whom he is the natural prey , what he may attribute to this evil occasion is the date and manner of his death , not his death itself . Certainly the date and manner of death are all-important ; constitution , conduct , and fortune determine them more or less nobly . One man dies in youth of his virtues , another in middle life of his vices ; some die of hardship , overwork , or starvation , and some kill themselves for sheer boredom and surfeit . The majority are overtaken on the way by some violent or insiduous disease or by some vulgar accident ; and a few linger on and die of old age , finding nothing else to die of . Death in battle , being violent and often premature , calls forth loud lamentations . These war-griefs are nobly tragic , in that they rise above the thoughtless feeling that we should live forever or that death in war is worse than death creeping upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . Death as it overtakes the unwilling , is ignominious ; and it is ignominious even in war for the herded rabble , who are not spontaneously or personally soldiers , but poor conscripts with a blank mind . This makes the unmixed pitifulness of many a casualty . So , among the sick and wounded , as with people dying at home , nature tortures herself in the vain struggle to ward off death to the last gasp , prolonging the proof of her congenital wastefulness and irrationality ; and when at last she breaks us and leaves the wreck of us in peace , that mock peace is ghastly , sardonic , and loathsome . Fortunately dissolution soon obliterates almost all traces of that vain resistance , and the broad currents of nature swallow and absorb it in some new formation , in which death and life are not to be distinguished . Meantime something important has happened . The reproductive organisation , which distinguishes life from motion and thereby  | makes death possible , has raised existence for a moment to a supermaterial status . Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volatile and evanescent of things , yet it possesses in passing a moral reality which can not be obliterated in the same manner as the organism itself , because spirit is essentially and in each instance self-centred , and indifferent to whether , from beyond , it be forgotten or remembered . And sometime under the spell of love , religion , or war , this spirit is kindled into a distinterested passion , that fears death so little as almost to court it , being purified in the white heat of a generous self-surrender , and sublimated by the very cruelty of fortune . It is easy , almost pleasant , to give up the world , if we know what the world is ; and we never die too soon , if we have found something eternal to live with . The aggressive side of war , which physically is brutal , is ennobled by spirit no less than the sacrificial side , which physically is slavish . There is no need of hating or vilifying the enemy . In himself , at a sufficient distance , he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But spirit , which is the child of a nature specifically and delicately organised , loves and reveres the order from which it springs . It is consecrated to the defence of that order , and to its perfection ; and nothing can be more glorious for it than to clear the jungle of dragons and giants , and to extirpate vileness and treachery at home . War brings many other evils besides the loss of life , some of which , like the destruction of ancient monuments , may be harder to repair than a diminished population . Numbers , where there is room for them , are soon supplied ; but war will be disastrous from a humanistic point of view if the new race is of inferior blood , or if with the race that has succumbed the aptitude for a high organisation has disappeared . If this has happened , even population will be permanently thinned , since a warlike manner of life requires a large hunting-ground , and discourages intensive cultivation of land . On the other hand , if only the peasantry be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in China and India , without otherwise benefiting by the liberal culture that may exist in higher circles . Wars will be wars of princes and revolutions in the fine arts or in religion . The masses will continue to plod , while those clouds pass over their heads , and will be decimated only by famine , pestilence , and taxes . It is often said ( and I too have repeated it elsewhere ) that  | war cuts off the flower of each generation , leaving only the baser weeds to inherit the earth . Where are the Achaeans of Homer , the Theban band , or the Romans ? Where is the chivalry of Christendom ? Where even the great lords of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ? Evidently they have all disappeared ; but the question is whether it is war that has exterminated them , or other causes that have abolished their status and made their descendants indistinguishable from ordinary people . It would require separate and thorough investigation to trace in each case the precise decline of particular physical or social types . War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Spartans after Leuctra ; yet the Romans conquered half the world after Can nae . Perhaps worse than the loss of life is the loss of confidence in such a case , and the oppressive sense that the world is too large and too irrational for our chosen ambition . New fashions in virtue will creep in , favoured by this discouragement ; or even hostility to virtue , and a positive taste for meaner things . Belated Don Quixotes , if they still arise , will pine in a vacuum , or pass for madmen if they venture out into the world . Wars may have played an important part in producing the social transformation that renders old moral types obsolete ; but not principally by killing off the old heroes in battle . If the bravest are the most likely to fall in war ( and this is now hardly the case ) they probably have put many cowards out of the way first . The fallen , however numerous , usually leave younger brothers or sons of their own mettle ; and on the whole courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory , rather than to exterminate themselves in winning it . The cycle in the rise and fall of nations and civilisations , without attributing any magical force to the tropes discovered , may be ascribed to the natural mutability of existence , each phase and each combination of circumstances issuing inevitably in something different from itself . Only where organisms are living bodies , propagating their kind through seed , may we expect cycles of evolution to be roughly repeated : roughly , because even where seeds are almost exactly similar , circumstances will modify the product , these circumstances changing according to laws and at a rate irrelevant to that of the organism in question . Slowly , these circumstances will even modify the seed ; so that the disappearance of types of men or of society , whether warlike or peaceful , is a matter of course , because the field in which they live changes physically and  | politically around them ; and they too change it , not always favourably to their original type of life merely by living in it . THE SECRET OF TYRANNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denouncing any systematic oppression or injustice ; and in that sense there is an element of tyranny in almost all dominations , because it is impossible to govern at all without disregarding the aspirations of some people in some directions . It is therefore simply a question of degree whether a government or a constitution , or even a free people , may be styled tyrannical : they will be tyrants if they trample upon many other people in many unnecessary ways . In a legal and historical sense , however , tyranny means absolute government established by revolution , and not sanctioned by the previous laws of the State ; so that if such a tyranny maintains its . if and obtains the sanction of a new set of laws accepted by the public , it ceases to be a tyranny and becomes a normal constitutional government . Power in such as case having been usurped by a coup cl'etat , the dislodged party feels the outrage bitterly , and the whole people is more disturbed , and more conscious of being governed , than in normal times ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments are more than ordinarily oppressive , the word tyrant , which only means lord , has become opprobrious . Tyranny is a sort of travesty of monarchy . The tyrant is probably a plebeian , or a leader of the plebs : yet he talks and acts and before long probably lives like a king . A popular wind then blows in high places , and opens them to the public mind , if not also the old royal parks to the Sunday crowd as a new promenade for the people . Such tyranny is the assault of a new and crude regimen upon a society not in its entirety ready for the change ; many privileges are abolished and many persons dispossessed who were formerly in the light , and are not reconciled to extinction . Yet extinction is  | probably their fate , and would have insidiously overtaken them even if the shifts of power in the official classes had continued their legal course . Behind the visible tyrant stands an invisible one : Neptune the earthshaker , a morose deity much disregarded in the public religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent Jove . The secret of this tyranny does not lie in human nature : for that reason it is a secret . Such transitions and catastrophes are not fruits of political calculation , but are forced upon men by physical fatalities , as if by a change of weather . They dominate the tyrant as much as the slave ; they exercise a circumstantial pressure , by which everybody is drawn into courses which no one has freely chosen . The art of an intelligent tyrant , like Lenin , is to read the signs of the times , to jump into the breach , " assume the god , affect to nod , and seem to shake the spheres . " This appears if we consider the degrees of subjection which men suffer in their various functions . Their subjection to convention is greater in words than in thought , and greater in thought than in action . A Christian , for instance , calls himself a sinner , but he seldom regrets his sins , and hardly ever corrects them . This is because he has been indoctrinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his conduct than in his opinions , and more like the blameless Ethiopian ; while his opinions in turn are far less Christian than his language . On the other hand , a soldier or a schoolboy will look quite obedient and smart on parade ; but there is make-believe in this alacrity , and a sort of mockery which is pleasant enough for a while ; yet presently the schoolboy will be making faces behind his book , and the soldier cursing his sergeant , his uniform , and his rations . Discipline may reassert itself at crucial moments , when gregarious impulses and sporting courage bear most people onward without much thought ; especially as there is commonly no alternative . There is some difficulty in thinking what else to do , when one is commanded and evidently expected to obey . The slave grumbles , but works , the child and the conscript are unhappy , but on the whole obedient , and willing to do their bit . They might as well . Round the tedium and desolation of daily life there are walls and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we can see beyond , is an even more forbidding barrier ? isolation and the fog of the unknown . The world has caught us in a trap ; but it did so when we  | were born , and we are used to the feeling . Consecrated phrases wrap our minds up in a cloud ; we can no more stop using them than we can stop breathing . These are fatalities to which it is wise to yield gracefully ; they are unavoidable and they are sometimes pleasant . Those who break away from convention are usually right in thinking convention arbitrary and in some measure oppressive ; but they are probably wrong in thinking their own heresy less arbitrary , and not likely to be oppressive in far more important respects . Impatience and criticism are necessarily founded on some friction of surfaces , which it is indeed a pity not to remove if possible ; but this regrettable friction does not enlighten the discontented mind about the grounds for those arrangements , or even about the source of its own dislike of them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its favour . At least that convention possesses , or has possessed in the past , some congruity with the circumstances of life ; and this can not be said of any dream , or wish , or utopia . No doubt the latter too have adequate causes ; and subjectively a utopia or dream may even be more profoundly rooted , and more important for a penetrating moral philosophy , than all the laws of a city or maxims of a Church ; yet even in that most favourable case , the prophetic soul may be wasting its eloquence , if the dream is too beautiful or the utopia out of tune with the movement of the world . The secret of tyranny , then , is not to be looked for in the tyrant 's unusual wickedness or love of power . If a desire to lay down the law could make a despot , surely the enemies of tyranny would have become tyrants . It is not the will to dominate that they lack , but only the capacity or the opportunity . Nor is the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people : under any system of government , even when they imagine that they rule themselves , the people grumble and acquiesce , with no great illusions regarding the wisdom of their rulers . But there are slow mutations in the sub-soil of politics , felt as sudden shocks upon the surface ; and tyranny embodies a part of this transitory tension , where society is blindly changing the balance of its institutions . So it was in ancient Greece , during the epidemic of tyrannies . The aristocratic age was coming to an end ; material growth had made that patriarchal regimen impossible . But the noisy wideawake democrats in the agora had no competence to take charge ; a city was a sacred and military heritage . By the skill and im-  | pudence of the tyrant this heritage might be accepted and transmuted into a modern constitution . So perhaps in our day dictators or national leaders may be smoothing the way for socialism , and establishing it in a form less hostile to tradition than a revolution could be without a permanent head ; because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of difficulties and of consequences than is a series of factions , succeeding one another in the government . A tyranny , supervening in the midst of some profound convulsion , marks a temporary equilibrium , coordinates the forces at work , selects consistent objectives , and leaves the ship of state already sailing a steadier course . Such at least was the work of those admirable tyrants Caesar and Napoleon . This subterranean explanation of tyranny would also apply to that margin of oppressive action inseparable from any social order . This order can not establish a perfect harmony amongst all the interests concerned ; and the interests neglected or sacrificed will murmur . They are not to be blamed for murmuring ; yet it is not wickedness or injustice from which they suffer . They suffer from the latent cruelty and blindness of all competitive life ; and it is their misfortune that their rivals , and not they , have succeeded in establishing a relative harmony . REVOLUTIONARY LIBERTY IT MIGHT seem a strange outrage to destroy the order that the past had evolved and had exquisitely refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty . Whence , then , had those institutions arisen if not from the union of inspiration and inclination with necessity in the life of the people themselves ? And after this outrage , it might seem an even stranger tyranny , if ever the people were inclined to re-adopt or to re-create something of the traditional kind , to forbid them that pleasure . But the French Revolution and the whole movement , still not quite spent , which proceeded from it , was not liberal except verbally and by accident .  | The world was to be freed from Christianity and feudalism ; it was not to be free to become Christian and feudal again . These were not regarded as normal episodes in human history , as forms of civilisation as legitimate as any others ; they were regarded as fiendish inventions foisted by tyrants on human helplessness and ignorance . That incubus removed , all mankind was expected to found a heroic , fearless , unchallengeable republic , composed by Catos , Brutuses , and Cincinnatuses . This rigid form of liberty being established , no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves were hardly men of that type , but idealogues and romantic orators , not always remarkable for their private virtues ; and Roman discipline would surely have seemed a cruel and stupid slavery to the whole tender school of Rousseau . What the Revolution was really making for , though hardly expressed with frankness before Nietzsche , was liberty absolute and forever empty ; liberty without foundations in nature or history , but resident in a sort of prophetic commotion . Custom , law , privilege , and religion were not to command allegiance , but to be themes only for criticism and invective . Hence the mortal hatred of any view that recognised realities , or built upon them . A truth , a fact , a past , a future , if definite and knowable , would abolish pure liberty , and it was essential , if this liberty were to be preserved , that nobody should build anything on it . If you settled something or made something , you would have become the slave of your action or of your work . The past was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , exorcise it , call it unreal , and see it wither and vanish at the word . As for the future , its own absolute free will would shape it as it came ; you need not attempt to make it your product ; it will know how to flout you , just as you flout the past . Only the present is ever real . A free soul inhabits the paradise of anarchy . Thus while politically the Revolution led to nationalism , industrialism , and absolute democracy , intellectually it ended in romantic egotism . The conflicts which might arise between different men would then be solved by force directly , as they are solved now indirectly by the intervention of the armed law . Each would either destroy the others , or so adapt his conduct as to suffer as little as possible from their presence . On this principle evolution seems to have established the economy of the lower animals and of the diplomatic world . The shocks that ensue occasionally are no doubt rude ;  | but if we asked any wild animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living , he would consent to become domesticated and tame , he would doubtless reject the suggestion with scorn . To acknowledge a superior authority , purporting to correct his natural Will and his sense of what is good , would seem to him a surrender of all that makes life worth living ? its moral spontaneity , its pleasures , and its pride in achievement . Better , he would say , one hour of passionate freedom and battle than an age of constraint , torpor , and peace . Governments in their origin have always had to struggle against this pride of absoluteness in the primitive soul . The bold pirate , the reckless gambler , the libertine , and the clever burglar remain popular heroes . A suppressed self in everybody would like to play these parts . The same deep rebellion against control reappears in every willful child , and in every willful idea . Heretics feel it in the presence of orthodoxy , and orthodoxies feel it in the presence of one another . They all prefer martyrdom to reform . ALIEN DOMINATION PATRIARCHAL monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of war . Being able to conquer , it does so ; and by a curious but easy combination , the father of one race is at the same time the tyrant of another . The two may retain different systems of law , language , and religion , but they have ultimately only one and the same government , that of the King . There is a kingdom within a kingdom , or rather a nation above a nation ; the first ruled by a patriarchal monarch , the second by a foreign despot , these two persons being one and the same . The elements of selfishness and beneficence in the ruler are not mutually exclusive nor merely juxtaposed . It is not necessary that in pandering to his own passions he should simply fleece his subjects , nor that when he serves his subjects he should simply sacrifice himself . That this is not the case is evident in foreign  | wars ; for then in protecting his people he strengthens his throne , and in extending his conquered field of taxation he probably enriches his original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government should be utterly distinterested , and should exercise the art of governing purely for its own sake and for the good of its subjects only , without also practicing what Plato calls the art of wages ; that is , without serving simultaneously his personal aims . A government of philanthropists , guided only by a sense of duty , would prove a detestable government . To be beneficent , one must first live ; and if beneficence is to be exercised amidst hostile forces and varied accidents , to be beneficent one must first be strong . One must have an inflexible personal bent and a great volume of life obeying it . Now , vigour absorbs energy ; it must be largely fed . In other words , a government to be beneficent and morally representative must be autonomous and full of initiative ; it must give direction , and not receive it ; the interests it discerns and pictures need not be the private interests of its members , but interests seated in their individual hearts , quickening their imagination , and enlisting their continuous efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , may be the service of other people , even in those matters for which he himself cares nothing ; he may play with children merely to amuse them , or give an alms out of pure benevolence ; yet even here , to play well with children he must first like children , and like playing ; and to make his alms truly charitable and acceptable , he must give it spontaneously and without second thoughts . The most impersonal and disinterested arts are also arts of self-expression . Alien domination can not plausibly claim the justification that a paternal government may have for its autocracy , namely , that it understands the true interests and fosters the true vital liberty of its subjects better than they , with little experience or traditional training , can do ; yet there is another element in wise management that a foreign government may perceive but that a native one , sharing the limitations of its people , might easily ignore ; and that is the radical and the ultimate conditions imposed by nature on each race or class , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least save us from some of our favourite follies . If a conqueror has a family or bodyguard of his own he may be a double monarch ? with parental authority over his house and lordship over his estates . He may further be a prophet , a medicine  | man , a poet , imposing rites , legends , and maxims on both sets of his subjects . Perhaps the difference between Oriental and European monarchy lies in this : that the Oriental had no separate family : his wives were his slaves , and his sons had no rights other than those of any favourite ; and woe to them if they seemed to be their father 's rivals . Religion and morals are still imposed by family tyranny rather than by the State ; for the State can hardly inspire them ; it can only expose scandals and suppress rebellions against itself . Most despotisms end by being tolerant in religious matters , that is by leaving every sect to oppress those born within its pale . This saves the monarch from religious arguments , attaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and favours good order within their respective flocks . If ever a universal government is established in this world , it would do well to act , or rather to abstain from acting , on this prudent principle , leaving each nationality and religion to govern itself according to its lights and traditions , not only in manners but in all liberal arts . It was a mistake of the Romans , when they built roads , bridges , and aqueducts , to build also Roman temples and forums for subject nations ; and not only a mistake politically , in that it might cause resentment in the native , but a mistake morally , if their aim was to spread civilisation . Not until the provinces and the city of Rome itself lost their classic aspect , did ecclesiastical , military , and domestic architecture , for instance , become free and picturesque , or did poetry and religion become varied and sincere . But unfortunately the Roman peace and commerce of the Empire were lost at the same time . DOMINANT CRIME ONE of the inspirations of man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein , it may end by persuading you that it is murder to boil an egg . For if you say it is wrong to inflict injury  | on any creature or to deprive it of any good , then all life would presently appear wicked and self-contradictory , since it is a choice between incompatible goods , and a competition between rival persons . Or if , to avoid condemning existence altogether , you say that it is wrong to inflict any felt injury , but not to destroy the life of a potential chicken as yet unconscious , it might follow that to put a man to death painlessly in his sleep would be , like boiling an egg , a harmless exercise of your scientific domination . To a sensitive conscience this lordly prerogative of eating , with the prospect of being eaten ( by worms and by time if not by cannibals ) is far from harmless ; it sanctions the universal dominance of crime . The rigid consequence of condemning such mutual destruction has actually been drawn , and the abolition of all competitive existence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue , however , draws the ladder up after it as it climbs ; and the earth remains altogether abandoned to the less sensitive sort of virtue that begins with the will to live . If you love life , you wo n't complain of a few bruises ; you may even court the greatest dangers ; and the very precariousness and dubious justification of living will encourage you to push forward , without a piffling calculation of goods and evils , either for yourself or for others . Your will , you may say , is your only rule of virtue . Adventure and labour , glory and death , are like the four points of the compass for your creative purpose . Very well : when this romantic language is reduced to its bare import , it bleats or bellows the will to live of irrational animals . But in man , who has long walked in the path of reconsideration , repentance , and the desire for union , such absolute willfulness is archaistic . It is an artificial intoxication , and a desperate apology for crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favourite theme of tragic poets and novelists . It is hardly necessary to analyse this domination coldly , or to show how it is possible and why it is enthralling . But the domination of crime over society is worth a little study , because the first thing that happens is that such crime calls itself virtue . At bottom this occurs also in the heart of the private criminal . In the first glow of his plottings and anticipations , he feels the fascinating and dashing character of his future act , and he always retains a certain fatherly pride and glory in it . Rakes boast of their debaucheries , burglars boast of their sly tac-  | tics , at least to their pals , and murderers congratulate themselves endlessly in private upon their admirable precautions . It is true that a contrary voice usually makes itself heard even in the closet ; not only misgivings about that cleverness and those precautions ? for events are incalculably complicated in this world ? but regret for advantages sacrificed to this fell passion , and disgust at the whole business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , his ruling passion does not dominate his whole being ; and in his inner dialogue he hears voices praising other things and making uncomfortable prophecies . Collective crime soon dispels these conscientious vapours . The commands of the chief , the public spirit of the band , the strict discipline internal to it , relieve the individual of doubts and scruples . He is no longer a bandit , but a hero . Nevertheless , the enterprise remains criminal ; because at the circumference it continually clashes not only with the interests of others , which might be disagreeable in war , but with the unavowed motives for the rash enterprise itself ; so that alleged particular injustices suffered or vengeance nobly exacted or feuds inherited or ulterior peace to be ensured must be appealed to in self-justification . In a word , the authority of the public order is acknowledged , and the crime seeks to shelter and excuse itself , within that order , as the lesser of two evils . To call a man or a government criminal is accordingly to pay them a relative compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as perhaps they are , by an absolute unqualified Will , like the lion and the eagle : but in reality , they are human , so that they ca n't help looking before - and after , and suffering a little at the reproaches of their victims . A conscience exists in them that needs to be appeased by excuses , or drowned in the clamour of sheer effrontery . And such intentional beastliness is , in one sense , better than beastliness constitutional and eternal . It was in this sense that Socrates proposed his characteristic paradox that to do wrong on purpose is better than not to be capable of doing right ; as a man who runs slowly because he chooses is a better runner than one who is equally slow at the top of his speed . Better physically certainly , and even better morally ( though naughtier for the moment ) because he can be corrected . The wild beast , the madman , the fanatic have integrity but are incorrigible in their harmfulness ; and in society any absolute singleness of Will and organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be exterminated , or caged as a curiosity , or disregarded as a minor nuisance . But fanatical consistency is seldom attained ; perhaps only by the first prophets of some new revelation . In the later apostles it soon begins to be mixed with some resisting elements of our common nature ; and good sense and good humour destroy integrity in an established theocracy long before scepticism undermines the system intellectually . But there is still a third temper often found in the third generation , or in the innocent pupils of the regimen . They have at first the illusion of integrity , throwing themselves without reserve into the prescribed life , as into a good and holy discipline ; and it is only later , on further experience , that they awake to the injury which they are inflicting on others and on themselves ; and they are horrified at it , and repent ? or at least there is a voice audible within them which , though it may be overpowered , prompts them to repentance . This is the typical state of the sinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sticking in that evil with regret , and confessing his impotence and division of purpose . Christian moral tales had been wont to represent the sinner as casting off his sin , warmly embracing a purer life , remote from his old passions and ambitions , and seeing heaven open before him as he rose from a baptism of universal renunciation . But there is another way of managing salvation in which the domination of crime is not ended abruptly and crudely , by suppressing crime and putting on a white robe of unnatural innocence ; on the contrary , the dominance of crime is accepted , enlarged , systematised , until it seems the dominance of crime no longer , but a sort of rapturous natural destiny , above the petty contrasts of morality . In Goethe 's Faust , for instance , the ravished Gretchen dies in her misery ; and we are consoled by learning that she is forgiven and goes to heaven . She has served her turn and that is the end of the story . But the guilty Faust does not need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun his career ; and strengthened by the experience of that first crime , he is ready to start upon fresh and nobler adventures . He will do more deeds , borne up through any incidental mischances by the consciousness of his own noble character ; and always equally vain and equally guilty , but always guilty and vain upon a higher plane of activity . Here is dominant crime in excelsis : for the heavens open before  | it , too , crimson and blue and silver-studded , with the eternal feminine forever leading the way . I am afraid that on earth , however , the denouement may be rather different , with the roles reversed . The ravishing Faust , so lusty in his galvanised youth , and so brave ? in spite of a little surviving pedantry ? in his knightly trappings , will grow feeble , vicious , and sad , like other sinners : he will revert to his narcotic draughts and his theosophical hocus-pocus ; and whether he go to heaven or to hell will soon make no difference to anybody . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her village garden , that in time will renew her youth , turn to honest loves , and learn in the four watches of the night to despise her shabby seducer. // DISTINCTION BETWEEN CRIME AND MADNESS IT SEEMS necessary to admit that living beings , like the blind forces of nature , may do harm without doing wrong ; for like the blind forces of nature , which never cease to work through them , living beings may be incapable of perceiving or of sharing the interests which they trample upon . And this without any lack of intellectual and moral keenness ; because the principle of integrity is one , and that of beneficence is another . Incapacity to sympathise with certain animals , such as vermin , or with certain human interests , such as strange lusts or strange religions , may actually be a mark of integrity in clear-cut souls ; and barbarians always regard it as disgraceful for anybody to be more tender than they are themselves . In such cases integrity may be compatible with cruelty , drunkenness , lust , vagabondage , witch-burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An upright barbarian can not justly be called criminal , however maleficent he may be ; he is virtuous in his own world as the vermin and the vultures may be virtuous . It would be a nice question for the sentimentalist , whether he ought not to sympathise with barbarians , and wish them a happy  | hunting-ground for their energy , where they should not seriously annoy anybody , as he would wish a happy hunting-ground for those innocent vermin . It is not reasonable to require all animals to be beneficent like the kind sheep supplying us with wool and mutton , nor is it generously sympathetic to sympathise only with those who sympathise with us . The narrow and fierce soul of the crocodile , too , is living and real . Nevertheless , in practice , barbarians are criminal ; for they do not commonly attain integrity , although it may be a part of their voluntary obfuscation to proclaim that they do . Just as often religious madmen ( at least when the madness is acquired by precept and sustained by propaganda ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make believe consistently , their chief madness being the love of going mad , so in the most systematic and sanctified ruthlessness there is something histrionic . Only a part of the soul adheres to that fanatical system , and it has a hard fight against obvious facts and against contrary instincts . But as the parts of villains in plays are often the most interesting and display the greatest skill and concentration ( because the way of the transgressor is exciting as well as hard ) so it is in playing the villain in real life ? you have to dominate yourself , and keep all your wits about you , lest you lapse from your self-imposed and exacting character . For this reason when people undertake the defence of systematic crime they can not do it consistently : they have not the courage of their principles . Some Greek Sophists in their effrontery , some prophets in their zeal , Machiavelli in his cool acceptance of human wickedness , Nietzsche in his ecstatic egotism , may have tried to walk this ethical tightrope . They have done it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each case , but always forced . They are acting out a self-contradiction : defending crime , when crime is actually condemning itself , because to be criminal is to plan an injury when you feel it to be wrong . Whether a passion be called mad or criminal hangs largely on the temper of the judge . A man will often speak of his own passions , when past , as madness . I lost my head , he will say : I was beside myself . This is his way of assuring you what a sound person he is at heart ; had he only been himself , his conduct would have been perfect . But when we call the passions of others madness , we mean to condemn those persons absolutely ; had they merely been  | yielding to some human passion , with which in this instance we were displeased , they would appear as normal competitors in the general scramble ? though by chance inconvenient or odious to ourselves . But by calling those passions mad , we imply that they work havoc on their possessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our enemies ; we would gladly become their friends ; but unfortunately they are mad , and what can one do with mad people ? Father , forgive them , we say , like the coroner over a suicide : they are temporarily of unsound mind . RULING MADNESS MADNESS , when recognised as a disease , excites distress and pity , or when merely gaped at , as odd and silly , it may excite laughter ; or , in its inward misery , it may seem a divine visitation . We are all mad in our dreams , when outer impressions do not check our galloping ideas ; and marginal madness plays about us in our waking thoughts ; as a dog will scurry before and behind his pedestrian master and is whistled for sometimes in vain . Great passions and excitements touch madness at their summit : ' so that madness is not really an inhuman or demonic thing . It is only too domestic , too individually human , too headstrong to keep in step with things ; so that if it becomes central and directive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , so soon or so fatally as a summary view might suggest . A boat may lean over very far in the wind without capsizing , when there is ballast and momentum enough ; and a mind can yield to a vast deal of extravagance without coming to grief . Certainly madness involves some waste of energy : the spirit is not disembodied , and wild ideas imply a hectic disposition . But this waste may be inconsiderable ( as in dreams ) or compensated for by some indirect advantage as in many taboos and panics . Moreover , taken as a personal experience madness may be domesticated by receiving a moral and symbolic interpretation , perhaps  | actually relieving the stress out of which it sprang , as in ritual mourning . Ceremonial is a sort of mad echo of rational conduct , but measured and sober in its own field ; and this mad music is healing . The great waves of delusion that sometimes sweep over the world come from a momentary attachment of active impulses ( not mad in themselves , but restive and ignorant ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk and honey has been divinely promised , that the end of the world is at hand , that a plague comes from neglect of ritual observances , that ghosts are abroad , or that miracles are being worked round the corner . Unbelievers have a madness of their own : that theirs is the one race or the one philosophy predestined to rule the world , or to explain it . These persuasions soon lapse from the condition of urgent prophecies to that of mysteries and dogmas which nobody need quite understand or be much troubled by . The madness is then neutralised by a convention which corrects its implications and rationalises its deliverance . Yet while the embers of such madness smoulder congenially in the soul , any breath may blow it again into a flame : and the day of psychic epidemics is not yet over . A most beautiful illustration of dominant yet domesticated madness may be found in the Greek oracles . In the first place they gave out no permanent code of precepts or legislation ; and they issued summonses to no wars or revolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) like modern mediums . People seldom appealed to them except in extremities , when reason was silent , and a man or city could only have appealed to some casual omen , or drawn lots . The embassy to the oracle gave pause and ceremony to the deliberation ; the response came in an ambiguous verse in which the mutterings of the prophetess were already somewhat humanised ; and the questioner still had to decide for himself what to do , with a curious feeling that divine accomplices were half prompting , half baffling his action , and in any case making the issue their own . In this way a truly religious sentiment was , or might be , produced ? faith , humility , courage , conformity . Yet the aboriginal madness of the oracle was of the frankest : and the most intelligent and temperate of nations submitted , in the most crucial matters , to the inspiration of idiots . This might seem a horrible fate ; and yet if the wisest man of Greece ? Socrates ? had been asked to pronounce on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been better than that of the Pythoness and her tripos ? I am afraid that the decisions of oracles or of philosophers at best divert the course of very slender streams ; and that a different gas in the cave at Delphi would not have given Greek history a very different twist . Socrates resisted the Thirty Tyrants with heroic courage ; but his example , like that of Phocion , was powerless to arrest the general decay . What brought on the catastrophe was not any incidental error or madness ; it was a vast silent change in the constellation of forces in the geographic world , producing a transformation of custom and character in all Hellas . There had been something to defend against Persia ; but what was there to defend against Rome ? Independence is not an important good when cosmopolites ask for it ; and an administrative machine , even if jealously local , will not produce anything but taxpayers . Civilisations grow old and succumb to disease like individuals ; they become memories and can not breed after their kind except in the rarefied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so modify their manners and mix their blood that it seems irony to call them after the name of their ancestors . It was not the oracles , then , that destroyed Greece : that prophetic madness may almost have been a benefit , a cathartic , purging people of their insane wills , and enabling them to walk about in their sanity . It is almost normal to be partly mad : not only because sensation is visionary , and grammar arbitrary , but because there is a margin of less articulate wildness beneath these conventional fictions , a residue that will not submit to them . The point is not to be mad on the whole ; to keep your madness in leash , and to let it loose only in season . Plato , with an inimitable union of reverence and irony , identified madness with inspiration , and called it divine ; it comes from the fountains of nature , it is primordial . Yet it is not central or dominant , because the soul or life of the individual is formed by a harmony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it is achieved , is health and ( on the intellectual side ) sanity ; so that sanity and not madness is the constitutional principle of the psyche , and of all her organs . But this vital harmony is always imperfect , a sort of crust beneath which mighty chaotic forces are at work , as yet imperfectly unified or transmuted into the life of reason . Each of these parts is breeding an inchoate spirit with an incipient rationality of its own . Each slumbers or flares up with its special imagery and method ; and  | it is from one or another of these subterranean souls that dreams and inspirations break in upon the rational man . It is for him , in his sober equilibrium , to accept , use , interpret , and control these promptings . He is not mad for having them ; they are the materials for his rational synthesis . But if he lets any of them become dominant he is lost , and they also ; because after all the organ or member can not endure , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be all hand or belly or head , all will or all lust or all fancy , would make a horrible amputated monster , dying , not being born . Madness is fatal then if it reigns , but it may be neutralised and the energies beneath it may be turned to good uses if it is tamed and governed . After all , to exist and to wish to exist is itself a sort of madness ; yet life and passion are the basis of reason . You must live , if you are to live well ; you must assume some shape among shapes , become a phantom among phantoms , if you are to be beautiful . In morals and politics the soundness must be begged from physical realities , else morals and politics would become mad in the fanatical sense ? tragically , hideously , cruelly mad . But the primal irrationality of the Will , when reduced to measure , modestly rejoins the gentle and universal inebriation of nature , where madness is only innocent sport , exuberantly fashioning all sorts of temporary harmonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern mind has been the love of liberty ; but this love , when we examine it , appears to be three fourths hatred . There is the passionate , secret , accumulated hatred towards religion , wealth , and government ; and there is the hatred of all the ills that flesh is heir to , easily attributed to the wickedness and folly of other men . Mankind has always been unhappy , more unhappy perhaps when submissive and pious than when rebellious . The rebel is proud of himself and hopeful ; these are  | inspiriting sentiments , and in protesting against his misery he has half vanquished it . Misery in other cases may lead to self-depreciation and self-reproach , as if the fault must lie rather in oneself than in the ruling powers . These powers may even be idealised , in contrast to our wretchedness , and conceived as splendid heroes and happy gods . But such pious illusions are hateful to a free spirit . It will not only defy all tyrants , divine and human , but will declare all the ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humanity . Sometimes the love of liberty becomes open hatred of every independent thing limiting one 's own fancy : hatred of tradition , of greatness , of inequality , of truth , and even of matter . " What ignominy , " cries the brave young mind , " to allow myself to be hypnotised by some decrepit charlatan , merely because he speaks in hollow accents , has a white beard , and waves a wand ! Have n't I eyes as good as his , or much better eyes ? Have n't I hands much more skillful and strong ? Have n't I a will far more simple , honest , and clear ? To discover the true good I need but look into my own breast . There , written in large capitals I find the whole duty of man , the obvious rule for disseminating a perfect happiness . There nature has deeply engraved the eternal law of liberty : THINK As You LIKE , SAY WHAT YOU THINK , Do WHAT YOU CHOOSE . " There is a possible difficulty here , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind there were nothing but this law of freedom , the law would remain inapplicable , because that empty mind would never know what to like or what to think . This happens sometimes to young children . If they are awake , and not crying for food , they begin to cry out of sheer boredom . The rattle or ball must be fetched at once to attract their attention , and suggest an employment for their blank liberty . Theoretically , this difficulty is fatal to libertarianism ; there must be given motives , given organs , given objects , before liberty can exist or can begin to move . Liberty is not a source but a confluence and a harmony . In practice , however , the very definite structure of the human body and the very definite solicitations from outside give to the sense of liberty abundant employment ; so that the little monarch , playing with his toys , never suspects how completely he depends on his heritage and his circumstances even for his liberty . I turn , however , to another consideration politically more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate  | and has chosen something to do . If contrary forces now appeared in that field , preventing the desired action , or destroying the free agent , evidently liberty would be gone . In order to be truly and happily free you must be safe . Liberty requires peace . War would impose the most terrible slavery , and you would never be free if you were always compelled to fight for your freedom . This circumstance is ominous : by it the whole sky of liberty is at once clouded over . We are drawn away violently from irresponsible play to a painful study of facts and to the endless labour of coping with probable enemies . Yet that is not the worst of it . If liberty demands peace , peace does not merely demand that other people should not meddle with us ; it demands equally that we should not meddle with them . It would really be as much a breach of the peace , though not so painful , if we broke their heads as if they broke ours . Besides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own heads might be broken . But if we are not free to break any head or any heart or any bounds , what sort of liberty remains to us ? Liberty to follow the golden rule : whereby our free hearts are at once sobered and transfixed in their inmost affections . What a surprise , when we had proclaimed our complete freedom , to find ourselves condemned by it to eternal vigilance and to the most drastic discipline and reversal of our natural Will ! The superman sees himself committed by his supermanhood to the morality of the slave . But perhaps all this is a mistake , and I have done injustice to the heroism of free spirit in supposing it anxious for peace or security or length of life . Perhaps its joy is to live dangerously and instead of the golden rule which involves the degradation of respecting the preferences of others , the superman may invoke the lilies of the field that take no thought for the morrow . Such mystic placidity after all can survive in this world and is surely in as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are knowingness and craft ; which is not to say that the superman need fail to be ruthless as well as placid . At times he may enact the lion , the true lord of creation . Nor is this impulse to live in the magic present merely lazy or merely immoral ; it expresses , perhaps out of season , the ultimate relation of spirit to the miscellany of existence . Spirit is essentially the timeless witness of it all , untouched and incredulous , yet for that very reason omnivorous and fearless .  | Here is a first glimpse of a paradise of anarchy , in which peace should reign not as in Eden by dint of organisation and harmony , but by the perfect insulation of each life and its utter irrelevance to all others . This is an idea that might perhaps be realised in the interstellar spaces , if free spirits there could forgo that love of preaching which characterises them on earth . They would probably abandon it , or else it would abandon them ; because what bends the spirit to the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , its dependence on the vicissitudes of material life . Could you cut off this attachment materially you would have dissolved it morally . Not being rooted any longer in an earthly person or station or passion , spirit might have ceased to be social and competitive ; it might have ceased to be preoccupied even with the defence or propagation of its own life . It would think anarchically , without so much as the notion of a truth to which it might conform . It would pursue that gala scienza which is not knowledge of anything but pure composition . Yes , it would have become too free to think . It would only sing . As we shall see presently , this is far from the end of the story ; but it indicates the direction of spiritual emancipation . The notion of pure spirit abstracts from human nature , and does so legitimately , because there is no reason to suppose that spirit is peculiar to man . Biological analogy would suggest that any creature moving organically with obvious reference to the past or the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of spirit . In such a case , action and adjustment are virtually selftranscendent ; in reacting they enact the movement of the object , dancing as it dances ; so that the animal not only possesses its own life but lives in awakened sympathy with outlying things , and partly from their point of view . Raise this behaviour to the level of feeling , and you will have synthetic consciousness or spirit ; to which some part of the world is revealed , so to speak on a map , impartially , as in fact the parts are distributed in the plane of causation . The centre of action and speculation ? it is the same centre ? will remain individual and personal ; the action will continue to obey an organic impulse ; but by the sensibility of the organism the world will have been surveyed ; and the organism itself will figure in that survey as an incident in the world explored : now one of the patches on the map will be labelled Myself . The virtual self-transcendence of intelligent action will have become  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all existence . Once thus awakened , spirit has turned the tables on life . It has potentially discounted every vital and moral perspective ; it has begun to conceive how things actually grow and work ; the organism will no longer dumbly undergo the influence of their presence . Spirit is called spirit because it is breathed in and breathed out into the infinite air ; it would not be spirit if a certain disloyalty , a certain love of anarchy , were not native to it . This essential impartiality of spirit is normally exercised within narrow limits . Language , manners , and practical good sense correct severely the childish spirituality that runs too far afield in this world , or finds too much fault with it . Yet the insidious principle of emancipation is at work even in those social conventions , in so far as they are at all understood or focussed in reflection . The philosophic mind will discover that the order of society is unstable , and in the very act of studying the various forms of order and comparing their fruits , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Not that pure spirit would tend anywhere to relax the existing order , to which spirit , in this special instance , owes its existence . The disruptive force in society is not that of understanding , but that of some political passion contrary to the prevalent one . Spirit is already free enough both from the unreformed and from the reformers when it has understood various forms of order in their natural diversity and contrary perfections . Yet this inalienable liberty with which the possession of spirit endows the individual inverts the order of genesis in human life . The individual criticises society , but society has produced the individual . This contrariety ? for it is not a contradiction ? causes infinite trouble . Society , or those conventional domineering persons who speak in its name , thinks the individual exists only to serve it . But what a monstrous thing to sacrifice all the living parts , in order that the nominal mechanical whole may continue its blind career ! We know that the first-born was once sacrificed superstitiously , in hope that the family might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still perpetually sacrificed in order that the world may keep up any melancholy routine which it has once adopted . And as one day the voice of reason held back Abraham 's hand , when he was about to obey the voice of society , so at any time the spirit ,  | morally autonomous though physically dependent , may reject the domination of those social passions which after all are only imposed upon it and occasional . To live without let or hindrance would be life indeed , and so the spirit actually lives in its happier moments , in laughter or in quick thought . Yet there is a snare in this vital anarchy . It is like the liberty to sign cheques without possessing a bank account . You may then write them for any amount ; but it is only when a precise deposit limits your liberty that you may write them to any purpose . So the spirit , before it can be vital or free , must exist ; there must be oil in the lamp , there must be substance and organs and circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give it direction , to offer it entertainment . At the level of complexity at which thought and laughter are possible , to exist means to be distinctly organised , localised , contrasted with other things , and conditioned by them . It means to have a mock freedom only ; freedom to exert oneself spontaneously in one way , but no freedom to exert oneself otherwise or not at all or under different circumstances or with another result . In order to live without control and absolutely ungoverned , as the spirit thinks it lives , it must be controlled by an organism that governs itself . In other words , it can not be anarchical , but must be inwardly , precisely , and irretrievably governed . I say advisedly , " in order to live . " There is a sense in which spirit is not compelled to persevere in existence , or to develop or complete any thought . It may flash and disappear , to be kindled elsewhere , in some other organism or in different circumstances . It may still be spirit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if it could remember these wild vicissitudes ( though this would hardly be possible ) it might conceive them as collapses and free growths of its own being . Yet in those scattered instances , spirit would be only being born , suffering , and dying ; it would not be living . It would not be preserving or defending or developing any kind of labour or affection . Its own anarchy would kill it , because life is an exercise of self-government . No blunder could therefore be more radical than that of destroying the ruling powers in order to enjoy life . The rebellion of Lucifer was essentially a suicide : reducing himself to free spirit he reduced himself to nothing . Real powers are always definite , or they would not have definite results . Even that passive capacity to arise and suffer and be extinguished which I was just now attrib-  | uting to pure spirit depends on a prior precise organisation of animal life : spirit comes when the occasion has summoned it . And the very pride and joy of spirit in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cares annoy , much thinking entangles us in vain suppositions : therefore it is a relief to dismiss all responsibility , and float or bask or sing . Dissolution itself may be pleasant if there was a painful tightness before ; and one organ in ceasing to function may allow , for a moment , freer play to another organ . Hence the illusion that liberation in itself is a good , and that complete freedom would be paradise . It is true that we live by metabolism , by subduing old substances to new forms ; and the inherited psyche within us suffers variation and cyclical decay . This is only another way of saying that a continual dying is a condition of physical life . Only spiritual life can be wholly vital ; but for that very reason actual spirit is altogether volatile and evanescent and dependent for its existence on an endless labour of birth and death in the material sphere . The paradise of anarchy is accordingly but a momentary sporadic enjoyment of an underlying paradise of order . For every unit in nature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence as far as circumstances permit ; but when the surroundings prove too unfavourable , that nucleus will contract , and bide its time , until it is wholly destroyed ; while a well-knit and proud psyche in such a case may desperately entrench itself in its own apparent sufficiency , and may boast that it will live better or at least die happier feeding only on its own heart .  | DEGREES OF MILITANCY ENTERPRISE is a form of militancy without moral provocation and without enemies . Like faction it feels itself to be a virtue , not only for showing courage and initiative , but particularly for doing so peacefully , without any lust for blood or vengeance , and purely at the call of some open chance to attempt untried and glorious things . And yet , although so blameless and admirable in itself , enterprise somehow secures less admiration and honour than do military or revolutionary achievements . The abusive rhetorician and the smashing victorious general get all the ovations , and the man who has proved his mastery over the fruitful world is never entrusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in which everyone participates at least in imagination ; but the private discoveries and inventions of the adventurous mind work the transformation of society often without being noticed at all . Even the disasters of warlike ambition fill history with tales of heroism and martyrdom , and even more dramatic crimes and punishments ; while the failures of enterprise , if remembered , excite only ridicule or contempt . Enterprise is indeed less social than faction in its inspiration , so that the world is naturally less concerned with it as it arises , although society may be more affected by it in the end . Empires and forms of government disappear completely at frequent intervals ; while the arts and fashions that distinguish each civilisation , although they may be lost on the surface , usually leave their mark in the habits of at least a part of mankind . The nineteenth century began with two extraordinary eruptions of faction , the French Revolution , tamed but spreading , and the Napoleonic wars . The first of these is still at work in several different ideologies and parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . The second half of that century , on the contrary , was filled with brilliant enterprise in science and  | industry , producing a revolution in the equipment of human life and mind , which has continued with acceleration to the present time , and is presumably destined to make a wholly new era in the relation of mankind to the latent energies of matter . Medicine , most beneficently , communications and means of transit most astonishingly by radio and air , have respectively relieved and frivolously complicated human existence . Meantime two general wars on an unprecedented scale , and the Russian Revolution , with its repercussions everywhere , have left the intellectual and political world bewildered . It had thought , until 1914 , that dominated as it was by beneficent enterprise , it would continue to grow daily more populous , richer , better instructed , freer , and more secure in its picturesque variety of nations , all united in one web of accelerated motion , time saved , labour lightened , and sports , private but more conspicuously public and professional , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless excitement . Still floating in the haze of this mentality , the prophets of enterprise founded the League of Nations and twenty-five years later the rather too similar Organisation of United Nations . In this , as a Charter member , was included the Soviet Union , an ultrademocratic comrade , who had been allied to the conquering Germans , and had been saved by American aid from their treacherous invasion , a comrade who now took the Germans ' place , occupied half their territory , and obtained the right to veto , in the Council of the United Nations , every measure that the other comrades proposed . It might seem that these prophets of Enterprise in their innocent goodness were not militant at all : what other ministers of foreign affairs ever carried goodwill and cooperation so far ? I think , however , that the pure essence of militancy is more dominant in these prophets than in ordinary hunters or warriors . The latter are prompted at bottom by material needs or material lures ; renown and praise , which saints and poets may also obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the material domination which their feats can procure . Their ambition is to improve their position rather than to transform the world . But the desire to improve the world is militancy in excelsis . It involves not only the exercise of power but the miracle of creation : to see mankind adopt one 's thoughts , obey one 's precepts , and draw forever the line between good and evil exactly where we have  | drawn it . What enterprise could be more ambitious and show a more extraordinary self-confidence than the assumed mission to judge and to convert all the rest of the world ? Can these politicians and socialist professors of philosophy think themselves divinely inspired ? Or can they regard their own country or their own party as the one right model and right censor for all mankind ? It is not in such plain words that they proclaim their purposes , but rather in terms of the economic or popular advantages that they enjoy at home and generously wish to diffuse among less fortunate peoples . They hardly conceive that these other peoples may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so , and to advocate the right of self-government for all nations . Yet they establish at the same time a universal authority , to which all would have to bow if it were able to govern . Perhaps the cause of this contradiction lies in the fact that Enterprise in the economically advanced countries has been chiefly economic . All nations would like to be prosperous ; and if it were only as a guide to prosperity that a universal authority was to be established , it might speak and act impartially , in the light of science . But some traces of moral and cultural militancy seem to remain in the proposed universal government ; and the attempt to impose such constraints , not imposed already by nature at terrible cost on the unprepared , would be of all enterprises the most deeply egotistical and probably the least successful . THE ROMANCE OF ENTERPRISE THERE iS a romantic side to all militancy , conspicuous in outlawry and war and in the lure of seafaring , so magical for the boyish mind ; but there is more homely romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives , its memories , and relics of successful ventures and varied contacts . Even without now going far from home , the sharer in great engineering or financial operations brings the whole world , as it were , into a focus there ; and  | the wealth that he may amass need not be merely material and enslaving , but a continual bond with far-reaching revolutions and exotic arts . This atmosphere may well surround a great merchant in his old age , and be the medium in which his children grow up , much more liberal than the air of military or factious households . For the young merchant himself , if he plunged without much backing into perilous enterprises , there was a different quality of liberal excitement in earlier life : there was hazard . The risk incidental to all buiness may become the dominant phase of it for the speculator on the stock exchange ; and he may be ruined as easily gambling there as on the turf . But the defiance that makes the manly vanity of a wager , even in a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because here the occasion for betting is likely to be expert knowledge , or the illusion of expert knowledge : and this is a factor not in the risk of enterprise but in the art and sure conduct of it . When the merchant holds a trump hand , and can guess the hand of his rivals , he is legitimately playing for results that will count in the world , for the right conduct of public operations , and not merely for the excitement of playing , with a superstitious hope of being suddenly rich . These spontaneous and liberal elements in enterprise should not be lost sight of if we hope to do justice to its political developments . Utilitarian economists , jealous of public rights against all the private passions of the public , may denounce the profits of trade as they might the rents of landlords , as being a sort of antecedent robbery of what should have belonged to the people . Yet these innocent robbers too form a part of the people , with primary human needs and ambitions ; and to satisfy these needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public good . So the arts and risks of the merchant have a natural attractiveness of their own , apart from any predatory motives that an envious revolutionary rhetoric may eventually charge them with . The dominance of trade comes about as innocently as the dominance of speech , and is just as much an element in the growth of human society . Every lively animal in his idle moments loves to experiment with his tongue or with his claws , and see what things he can do and what sounds he can make ; and these manual or vocal sports may become ingrained in his system , pleasant , inevitable , and by chance useful . So singers and poets , comedians and orators , priests and prophets acquire their special arts and  | perhaps win general applause and public esteem ; and yet their position in society remains at bottom precarious . Essentially their hold is only on the imagination . By accident they may acquire a material use ; yet there is nothing to insure their arts against proving utterly vain and perhaps pernicious . So a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human happiness , and spoke of sacra pinus , the accursed keel , that had brought foreign wares and corruption into Arcadia . And not only may the enterprise of adventurers be suspected of having evil consequences in itself , but it may be seen even by us to-day to avail itself of all those dubious auxiliary arts that misguide the unwary by appeals to the imagination . Instead of comparatively innocent cries of vendors or heralds announcing their wares or their news , we now have advertising and propaganda : arts explicitly bent on bending the public mind to party advantage . The process is like that of a lottery , catering to human weakness and popular delusions for the benefit of partial interests themselves probably hollow and deceptive . THE MIDDLEMAN IN TRADE IN PRIMITIVE barter , even when money begins to intervene , there is no dominance of any party over any other . Each knows his own positive interest and need , and closes the bargain willingly , with open eyes , thinking it on the whole to his own advantage . This advantage will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greater than the wish to buy ; resources and foresight may be unequal in the two bargainers ; one may be making a clear gain and the other only postponing disaster ; yet even the latter acts freely , and is not fleeced anonymously , without his knowledge or consent . Money , while a great convenience in exchange , introduces a middle term pregnant with terrible dangers . Without attempting to enumerate or to trace these dangers , which would involve a whole treatise on trade , I may here notice one circumstance which  | politically is the most remarkable . When there is a common currency , a third party , a middleman , may intervene in all exchanges . He may know nothing , except verbally and in terms of money , of the needs and interests of any other class . His own interest and need will be simply to buy his wares cheap and to sell them dear . To get the advantage in bargains at both ends will be his whole art and profession ; and that element of inequality in making exchanges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now becomes the sole means of living for the middleman , be he pedlar , shopkeeper , merchant , or banker . Trade has become an art in itself , and has bred a whole set of social classes living on an invisible toll which they levy on all people 's affairs ; it has become the art of " making money . " This abstract form of industry or finance is a by-product of concrete commercial enterprise , and not necessary to it . The pure essence of a merchant and of his eventual domination over mankind may be seen most clearly when he is an intrepid adventurer , sailing to remote countries , and dealing with alien peoples . Then his joy is to be the first to discover some savage strand where pearls may be had in exchange for glass beads , furs for coloured tissue paper , or an elephant 's tusk for a bottle of rum . So long as this sort of barter is possible , merchants are men of enterprise , loving finery and rare knowledge . Blue sea ports prosper and colonies pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trade settles down to a normal prosaic level , as if love had passed into wedlock . The merchant is no longer called a merchant but a dealer or a business man . He makes no perilous voyages ; there are few perilous voyages to make . Ships are insured , and merchandise also . The owners are probably unknown shareholders , or maiden ladies living on annuities ; while the partners or directors are only officials on fixed salaries . They do not sail the ocean blue but sit in an office , telephone in hand , waiting for the next report from the stock exchange or dictating perfunctory business letters to a frizzled and pouting typist . The profits of prosaic trade , in normal cases , may then loosely represent services rendered in distributing merchandise and making it accessible to the public . Enterprise now appears rather in the invention of mechanical contrivances , partly to cheapen production , partly to introduce new products . It is evidently not enough to invent a new machine ; it must either have a use for existing pur-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantness , become in itself , like the radio , a new object of passion , to diminish the tedium and multiply the commitments of civic life . The ultimate , the moral , use of such inventions might be hard to determine ; but in practice there is no need of doing so . The inventor has his own vanity and pecuniary interest at heart ; and the agents that disseminate his invention also have a pecuniary interest of their own to consider . Advertisement , propaganda , missionary work then introduce the new trick amongst the innocent million and develop a new demand . The point is to capture the public , and then , by force of fashion and custom , to induce the public to perpetuate your business . Society is then dominated by the producer 's interests , and trade proper takes a secondary and inglorious place . Capitalists and bankers are merchants sublimated and reduced to the abstract function of doing nothing but invest their money in order to increase its nominal total . Commerce is encouraged by these gentlemen in all markets at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ships , unless it be a private yacht ; they have no warehouse or shop , but an office furnished like a club ; and they deal in no special kind of merchandise . All their business is overhead business and all their profits overhead profits . They are international in mind , like the proletariat . They see in everything merely its value in money . Nothing therefore has any quality in their eyes except its quantity . Their incomes , which are sucked out of all their transactions impartially , tend in turn to be spent impartially and in all climates upon all luxuries . They are probably patrons of the fine arts everywhere , and if they smile upon or even practice any special religion it is precisely that form of it which , like a varnish , has the least smell or colour and gives the most polish . Even for the subject population , commerce breaks down local barriers . It brings nationalities together , not only physically in the great seaports , but ideally in the public mind . And it does so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerating the foreignness of the foreigner or the unbeliever and breeding a desire to abolish him . Commerce , on the contrary , after the first predatory and adventurous phase is past , assimilates trading nations to one another , and creates an economic organism larger than the political and moral one and rooted in all the nations employing their serv-  | ices . Those local organisms , moral and political , come to seem to the commercial mind accidental and perhaps troublesome , where they impede at all the pervasive and equalising prevalence of trade . A cosmopolitan upper class then grows up , all speaking well or ill the same fashionable languages and cultivating the same fashionable manners . Or a cosmopolitan middle class , like the Jews , already diffused throughout the world and dedicated to commerce , may rise to the top , and may undertake to subordinate all nations and religions to international cooperation and prosperity . In rising to the top , this cosmopolitan middle class takes over the arts and sciences and the literary activities native to the older societies and often manipulates them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is merely the subjective superiority of the incurable foreigner , who has no roots in the society he studies and has cut himself off from his own roots . Indeed , the commercial mind has no apprehension of roots of any kind and moves on a verbal plane of conventional maxims and utopian prophecies . This does not prevent it from inspiring respect in the half-educated public , proud to have outgrown old-fashioned ideas which militant intellect never possessed and can not understand . Wealth and progress in wealth with all its intellectual luxuries are visible gains , like those of a man winning the big prize in a lottery . Yet even wealth seldom comes to the uprooted in a satisfying measure , while the ethos and dignity of the past seem to them absurd or even pernicious . Thus the commercial mind imposes itself on the urban and suburban population , living in chance rooms or hired houses , easily migrating , picking up work individually , perhaps without friends or family , and guided intellectually by the newspapers , themselves a commercial enterprise full of information coloured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before such a population are far more superficial and ignoble than those natural to the individuals composing it ; even the leaders , in their speeches and proclamations , feel compelled to repeat empty phrases that at least alienate nobody . All they require is that their tone should encourage hope in the multitude and perhaps in themselves . Those who suspect the fallacy , or feel some cross-inspiration , may learn to put these doubts away as temptations , and be actually ashamed of them . Thus the grossest vanity and cheapest rhetoric are likely to carry the day politically ; yet they are not likely to  | carry it socially or permanently . An old civilisation sails with enough hidden ballast to neutralise the follies of a random crew . Four futile Republics , for instance , have not upset the balance of the French nation . The very superficiality of a commercial stratum ( for commerce is not necessary to life ) prevents a thorough domination on its part over society . If it dominated , it would dissolve society altogether . Yet there is a moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of commerce , and is enriched by it in culture as well as extended in power . A rural population may have had its religion and its minstrelsy ; but philosophical debate and the more critical forms of the fine arts require the concourse of many differing minds and of contrary traditions . The idle rich supported by commercial fortunes travel more and are better informed that is a military caste or a local seminary ; they elude the domination of any religious orthodoxy ; they may even become connoisseurs and counterfeit aristocrats with a veneer of facile refinement if not of distinction . Meantime beneath them , within and beyond a belt of suburban villas , a large commercial class imitates their culture , and makes a point of distingushing itself from the artisan and wage-earning class by cultivating a certain degree of emancipated mental vivacity . They offer a fertile field for party views and theoretical persuasions of every description ; they know nothing and criticise everything . Yet their commercial background still demands a modicum of honesty and steadiness ; and as they regard themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn away , as a class , from the political ideals of commerce . Taken by themselves into an innocent mind these ideals are not unattractive . Unattached circulating wealth , such as commerce accumulates , sheer invisible credit or money in the bank , acts as a sort of lubricant , giving a magic power to the mind . It opens up possibilities , uncramps old prejudices , stimulates the arts by the shock of the exotic , and creates a floating , idle , talkative , rationalistic atmosphere of universal information and easy competence . Information and agility , left to themselves , are morally important , but they never exist unsupported by elementary interests and passions , which may use enlightenment as an aid in their animal career . So buttressed and armed , and so enveloped in polite sophistry , human nature seems to justify itself and its ways . It becomes  | civilised ; but its civilisation runs no deeper than an intellectual draping of moral confusion . The high lights of history , the ages of Pericles , Augustus , Louis XIV , or Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood , when material enterprise has clothed itself in some sort of science or art , and is only beginning to decay inwardly and to withdraw the sap of life from those arts or sciences . I have seen , after the Victorian era , the commercial deluge which covered the earth rise into the air , and accelerate invention and motion so as completely to envelop mankind . This has been accompanied by a sudden , though unconfessed , collapse of the theoretic and artistic convictions which , in the nineteenth century , kept the polite capitalist world in countenance . Conviction has deserted the civilised mind ; and a good conscience exists only at the extreme left , in that crudely deluded mass of plethoric humanity which perhaps forms the substance of another material tide destined to sweep away the remnants of our old vanities , and to breed new vanities of its own . Or perhaps the revolution we are undergoing may turn out to be less profound and cataclysmic than the communists have undertaken to make it . Their loudly heralded revolution may internally " wither away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but some reassertion of national , military , or religious positivism , some specific type or types of human order and virtue , comparable to those that diversified the recorded and the unrecorded past . MORAL EFFECTS OF TRADE RURAL industry must always subsist beneath commerce and beyond the congested centres of manufacture on a large scale . The moral and intellectual principles proper to non-commercial classes must therefore always remain alive , even in the most commercial State . Sometimes , as in France during the Third Republic , a healthy national tradition subsists only as a precious heirloom committed to a dispossessed aristocracy and a despised peasantry , who live like  | foreigners in their ancestral land , ignored by a government of commercial and official parasites . The automatic political tendency of such a government has properly nothing to do with the fundamental interests of the governed nor , in the long run , with its own interests ; because the parasites could not subsist if the body on which they feed should perish . Yet this radical alienation of the politicians from the nation is disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the demagogues most alien morally are physically natives ; they have inevitably imbibed something of the traditions enshrined in the history and the older literature of their country ; whilst on the other hand , since the French Revolution , peasants , soldiers , and aristocrats , and even the clergy , have acquired intellectually , in so far as they live intellectually at all , the rhetoric and ambitions of the new age , and a way of life contrary to their traditional virtues . Thus all parties once in office continue to discharge the traditional functions automatically , with less disorder and contrariety than might be expected from their respective principles . The old order indeed lapses slowly and a new order appears unannounced , in complete defiance of the two sets of ideas frantically advocated in the two camps . In England , first with Protestantism and then with the fall of the Stuarts , a plutocracy bred by commerce began to recruit the old landed aristocracy , and gradually dropped the feudal , local , military domination that it originally exercised . Its pre-eminence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its much less princely way of living might be charged , in the national economy , to overhead expenses , or directors ' salaries . Political leaders are all constitutional monarchs on a small scale , following the policy of a responsible or irresponsible ministry imposed upon them by a lumbering heterogeneous mechanism which they never devised and probably do not understand . English national policy , without losing a certain refinement of form , has thus become essentially commercial ; with this dangerous aggravation , that the population has far outgrown the resources of the land , and has become , for half its substance , a parasite on other nations . It is obvious that in a fertile country , or in a country fed by another which is fertile , the parasites may outnumber the productive labourers ; and a democratic government may obey the wishes of the majority while oppressing or flouting the only true produc-  | tive and necessary class . Such a government may think it considers the interests of the majority in obeying their wishes ; yet both this majority and the government that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social and economic fusion softens the outlines of these distinctions . Classes intermingle : one man and one family may belong to several classes ; and the moral and intellectual atmosphere breathed by all may be almost the same , in spite of radical divergence in their primary interests . The Church of England , for instance , was meant to be , and in part is , a means of unifying politically the most crying material and religious conflicts . In doctrine and in spirit it is an indescribable chaos ; yet it serves its purpose all the better for this intellectual disorder when considered as an emotional eirenicon , or ceremonial means of creating a sense of unison , where no moral unison exists . Nor is this narcotic function merely social . The chaos in the private mind is soothed by the same influences . Nice people thereby reinforce their nice feelings , and a sham front of religious solemnity hides the moral insecurity of a life slowly losing its local roots and ancient loyalties . Not that commerce does not impose a definite morality , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tradesman 's religion . On the social and political side it enjoins a morality productive of prosperity and material progress ; and on the mystical side it excites the self-consciousness and metaphysical agony of a lost soul alone with the Absolute . But this extreme privacy and personal independence is not so contrary as it might seem to that social positivism . The arbitrary and mediocre character of the latter , with its petty meticulous and joyless duties , throws spiritual ardour , when this exists , all the more violently upon abstract speculation ; so that in the Protestant communities , on a background of prosaic commercialism , we find Calvinism and Methodism and Spiritualism and Christian Science and ultimately transcendental idealism crying prophetically from the housetops . These persuasions borrow a good deal from the business world in which they appear . For one thing , they all approve , foster , and sanctify business ; and they keep their ideality so thin , so amiably impotent and privately visionary , as not to make any incongruous inroads into business life , but merely to supply a safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , rec-  | titude , integrity , fidelity to duty , earnest acceptance of public prejudice , or no less earnest advocacy ' of some moral hobby not yet publicly dominant , are characteristic of a commercial society ; such a society requires these vital forces to cement its mechanism and to keep the private mind and heart docile to the industrial work in hand . This , indeed , is what still makes religion and morality such a solemn matter , about which scurrilous doubts are to be repressed severely . A similar , and very curious , influence is exercised by commerce on metaphysics . Commerce is favourable to enlightenment . It knows the difference between that which can be found , weighed , and measured , and that which is merely imagined : words , ideas , unrealities . While thoroughly contemptuous of mind , taken on its own account , commerce stoutly professes a kind of rationalism . Mathematics it thinks a true science , at least in its applications ; and the same may be said of physics , chemistry , and even astronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government renders all argument about them arbitrary and worthless ; we may simply observe the effect which , under different circumstances , these dominant conventions have on prosperity and on a placid order of society favourable to commerce . The economic philosophy of the merchant is international , but not so his religion or morality ; for these , while different in each country , are in each bulwarks of peace and order . An established Church should nowhere be disturbed , especially not the probably moderate dignified one which he maintains at home . The less meddlesome it is , the better ; its function is to keep people satisfied with themselves and with their social order . Variations may be tolerated , and refugees from other countries may be hospitably received , and may add , if not too numerous , a valuable element to the industry of the country ; but only if , at the same time , the orthodox native religion and system of government are defended and transmitted , not indeed unchanged ? there is no intrinsic value in any one doctrine or law ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working power of the people . Commerce is favourable to positivism in philosophy , to that sort of enlightenment which conceives that by overcoming a few needless prejudices all mankind might easily settle down in per.petual peace to exchange the greatest possible number and variety  | of objects . Also the greatest possible number and variety of ideas ; because ideas are cheap luxuries , satisfying and harmless . Liberty , then , in matters of opinion and , save as regards crimes against property , liberty , and personal safety . The protection of business naturally presupposes the protection of life . A man of business must not be interrupted or coerced by threats to his person . For him such foolish practices as duelling or carrying arms are anachronisms ; his legal rights are defended by the law , and he laughs at imaginary injuries . In case of libel or unprovoked domestic infidelity he feels honourably indemnified by divorce and damages . Such things may secretly distress him for the moment , but he is too proud to allow them to interrupt his public activities or prevent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all the stronger for not relying too much on other people 's virtue . Virtue is its own reward and vice its own punishment . Industrious habits , for instance , hardly need to be inculcated or bred into the rising generation by any harsh discipline . In a commercial " society , the idle and thriftless sink out of sight by the natural selection of the competent . No need , therefore , of artificial restraints on the young , or of useless instruction beyond reading , writing , and arithmetic . Not that the higher culture is excluded in such a society ; but it floats ornamentally at the top , like religion , sport , and social amusements . Nor does this render such culture inferior ; on the contrary , while a rooted national and moral culture would necessarily be one-sided and narrow , a loosely floating supervening culture may be universal . Universal culture is preserved in books and in museums ; there it may be reasorbed by specialists in each generation ; and a fresh crop of criticisms , histories , and biographies may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the latest critics supply . The best part , if not the whole , of criticism will soon be to criticise previous critics . Through this rich prism , as well as through that of its own particular temperament , the public will view with interest an everchanging perspective of the past , of the present , and of the future . What may be lacking in such a cultivated plutocracy will be only a native culture . No single inevitable tragedy will inspire poets or artists . Even music , which by its abstraction is able to supply to the careworn mind a luxurious interlude to its cares , without  | demanding any capacity to frame ideas , falls into the hands of professionals without roots , whose art and life are international . No social prescription imposes on their art any definite tone or any definite limits . The artists , or each sect of artists , form a kind of soviet , sovereign in its own sphere , and far from soliciting any higher patronage , decree that the public shall accept anything and everything at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a congenital disease ; it professes to create substance out of form , which is physically impossible . It suffers from the freedom of emptiness . Without a traditional subject-matter and a traditonal unquestioned method ? both of which may be congruously developed and transformed by individual genius and deeper understanding ? the strength of soul is wanting which is requisite for great achievements . The artist , even the historian or the philosopher , then becomes an amateur ; he plays with surfaces or falls into extravagance . Originality , which in living things comes unasked , is sought for to the point of cultivating absurdity and letting it pass for genius ; spells of archaism intervene ; savage art or ignorant opinion is rehabilitated and set up as if its very grotesqueness were a miracle of inspiration . The public is overawed , being told it is too stupid to understand ; yet perhaps it is flattered at the same time and encouraged to indulge its crudest passions and emotions , no longer secretly or in an underworld , but with a sort of bacchic enthusiasm , affected or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . What we call science , in the narrower sense , may be said not to have existed before the modern commercial age . Diligent measurement and experiment distinguish science from common knowledge , however certain , and from speculation , however clairvoyant . But diligent measurement and experiment are necessary in commerce . They are involved in navigating the high seas and the air and in inventing all elaborate machinery . If science could be reduced , as it may be reduced by definition , to mere measurement and experiment , all images and hypotheses being regarded as incidental and negligible , science would become simply such knowledge as is useful in industry . Undoubtedly monumental arts like engineering and architecture also require science ; but here the process of construction is itself only a means to the possession of the perfected work , which in  | itself has amiable uses and values for the imagination ; whereas the application of science to trade serves only trade and the interests of the middleman without reference to the spiritual uses of his trade or his inventions . It might rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middleman have unintentionally done mankind a service in stimulating enormously the pursuit of physical science , which is a spiritual good in itself ; and this even if wireless communication , aeroplanes , and atomic bombs proved in the end a curse to mankind . When science , essentially a liberal interest , is enormously stimulated by economic pressure and rewards , the pure investigation itself need not be infected by any worldly motive , at least not among genuine inquirers . Sometimes , on the contrary , the joy of discovery may be heightened by the warmth of public interest in it , and of the human benefits that may ensue . And subjectively even the obstacles or perversions that the world may have put in the way of true science may intensify and purify the love of it in the struggling mind ; as we may feel in the case of Michelangelo , whose genius was harassed by official demands and taboos , how his love of pure beauty was sublimated the more , the more he saw and depicted the contrariety and vanity of the passions that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this tragic shadow cast by the world and the flesh over the summits of free imagination is exceptional ; the effect that strong material influences have on the liberal arts is usually more direct and obvious . A prosperous society tends rather to increase the number of artists , intellectuals , and scientific experts , while transforming their quality . They all become more ambitious and less disciplined , none apprenticed and all original masters . A public composed of capitalist patrons will prove individually very critical but without any common taste or criterion . The problems presenting themselves for solution will be miscellaneous and constantly more technical and mysterious . Any subject and any method will do for a fresh professorship ; but it will not serve for long . The ground will be constantly quaking , and the edifices will never be consistent or complete . Commerce will have produced loose wealth without a function , and omnivorous taste without a standard ; it will have multiplied the materials of the liberal arts , and dissolved their types . //  | RADIATION OF ENTERPRISE COMMERCE produces nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who levies a tax for arranging to collect and distribute merchandise already existing . Also , by exhibiting or advertising his wares , he may create a market for them where they were not previously required . Manufacture may thus be stimulated in one place and agriculture in another , and a division of labour established on a larger scale than would have been possible without foreign exchanges . The necessaries of life being now more abundant in both places , population will increase and the poor will become more numerous , while the merchant grows richer , since he now levies his tax , though diminished for each consumer , on a larger community . At the same time the variety of articles offered for sale will dazzle the eye , and everybody will be tempted to indulge more and more in superfluities . Thus commerce , without directly producing wealth , indirectly produces luxury . When the arts have only a home market , farmers and artisans can dominate their industry in its entirety , modifying it according to their personal fancy or the needs of their clients ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary merchants open up distant markets , they facilitate production on a large scale in standardised forms ; and then the useful arts grow cheap and mechanical ; while at the same time the whole world is flooded with exotic products which confuse the public taste and incite it to be omnivorous . Militancy in enterprises here has the opposite effect to that of militancy in faction . Enterprise in trade and in industry tends to diffuse knowledge and taste , and by making culture cosmopolitan undermines in each place or period its specific tradition and inspiration , so that the arts become everywhere anarchical and debased . Faction , on the contrary , in narrowing its aim and excluding everything irrelevant to it , concentrates human virtue on militancy itself , bringing out at all costs the chosen type of order and harmony , so that the works of that forced unanimity are meagre , even  | when imposing by force of the intensity of Will that animates them ; but they probably pay for this special strength by a hopeless monotony , ultimately dwindling into decay ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave their trace in the world . Compare for instance , the futile discipline of Sparta with the fragile spoils and allurements of Venice ; or the ruins of Norman England with the rubbish heap that may one day remain of its smoking industrial works . Militancy of both kinds is equally distracted and barren , considered rationally ; but each has its passions and incidental compensations for those whom it genuinely enlists and inspires . Politics at the middle of the twentieth century offer an important illustration of this possibility . Trade , at least foreign and seaborne trade , was always a matter of militant enterprise , provoking competition and sometimes war . But industry , in its beginnings and in its vital impulse , had always been a spontaneous habit , even in some of the lower animals , when they possess bills , fingers , or can weave nets with fibres spun within their bodies , as in the case of birds , monkeys or kangaroos , and spiders . And in man this playful industry found many economic uses and at the same time developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like those of nature , when anyone had gathered or cultivated them , became objects of possible barter or profit ; but there is nothing intrinsically militant about them ; since the most recalcitrant materials aid the artist who respects them , and stimulate his invention more than they delay it . As to the destructive accidents that may crush him and his works together , these are foreign assaults , not to be warded off by free industry itself , but only perhaps by some purely engineering or military art developed independently . Industry and , as the word indicates , manufacture , were long cultivated by single artisans , like the fine arts , in private , by the fireside , or with a few domestic apprentices . These domestic tasks had nothing to do , in their origin and spirit , with exchange or sale of the product . Objects were fashioned for private use , or by personal caprice , or in imitation and rivalry of other performers , as in sports , dancing , and singing ; and ultimately , in the most important traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons or animals , and lend them a monumental sacredness in their immobility and their preternatural size and expression . If anyone excelled in these productions , and his neighbours asked for copies ,  | or the tribe or village engaged him to carve their totem or decorate their arms or their family tombs , he might become a professional artist , and live by the gifts given him in exchange for his works ; but it would always be by his science and inspiration that he was guided in his labours , like a minstrel or chieftain . There would always be personal freedom in his art , and as much beauty and caprice as utility in its products . So , before commerce intervened , industry composed , decorated , and varied the paraphernalia of life according to the needs and tastes of each region and of its artisans . These two properties , of being personal and being local , combined to render primitive industry both variable and , at each place and date , distinctly typical ; so much so that by the character of potsherds archaeologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mediaeval cities , when of kindred race or religion , no doubt somewhat influenced one another 's industry , but less than we should expect ; how little contagion , for instance , in the parallel and often contemporary developments of Byzantine , Romanesque , Gothic , and Saracenic architecture and decoration , though they had the same background in antiquity ! Yet in spite of their close analogies each kept its own local character and special evolution of taste . No community seemed to be confused in its work by knowledge of the different work of other communities , and industry in each retained something of the character of liberal art . Even when during the Renaissance , the patrons and critics of art became intolerantly classical in doctrine , the artists in practice never attempted to copy the ancient monuments but preserved the framework and the spirit of their own traditions . Much less did utensils , furniture , or clothes attempt to reproduce the forms they had had in Rome or Athens . That theatrical masquerade had to wait for the French Revolution . The effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintended , profound , and morally fatal . They have turned industry from a liberal art become , for a few , a means of livelihood , into a militant process of making as much money as possible ; the investors by gathering higher and higher profits , the workers by exacting higher and higher wages . The free life of neither class has any moral roots in their working life . If competition obliges them to study the uses and appeals to taste possible in their line , those technical matters are relegated to specially  | trained salesmen or designers on fixed salaries . As for the industrialists themselves , their spirit awakes , if at all , only after business hours . The workmen therefore are always demanding shorter hours and more holidays ; but the directors are either only mock business men , who lounge a few hours in their office thinking of their sports and their vices , to be enjoyed on getting out , or else calculators and investigators , studying every market , and every possible financial operation ; so that when they go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are bored to death , except when the post brings them their business letters , or alone in a corner they can take notebook and fountain-pen from their pocket , and make for the third time some important calculation . A public effect of such militant commercial industry is the dominance of their producer in universal economy . You invent some new article ; you advertise it ; you perhaps pay some influential person to use it , talk about it , and make it fashionable , and you have enriched creation with a new requisite , a new convenience , or a new vice . This reversal of the moral order , by turning means into ends , might be classed with the fallacy of the miser who lives like a pauper for the sake of growing rich . A psyche , made illiberal by being trained exclusively in one useful discipline , may feel absolutely pledged to that habit , as by a categorical imperative , even when it is worse than useless . Political theorists and even philosophers are often caught in this trap . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can exist only for the sake of the tribe or the State ; a sentiment that probably rests on two different sophisms vaguely accepted : one , that because everyone owes his birth and nurture in infancy to his elders , he can never become or do anything that is not due to society : and the other , that the traditions and culture which civilised life transmits are not dependent in every particular for their origin and continued acceptance on the individuals who have carried on those traditions , perpetually modifying or corrupting them by their personal initiative . Commerce is inevitably favourable to the growth of great cities and to the domination of the urban mind . Ancient cities were primarily built for defence , and the market was held at the foot of the citadel , often outside the walls . The number of citizens was limited to the local exigencies of defence and subsistence , and the political organisation was incidental to the military , or superimposed , like religion and eloquence , for the real or supposed benefit of the  | State . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquests abroad , has given commerce a freer hand , the centre of gravity of the State passes from the citadel to the market . There is then no limit to the possible growth of the city : a million , two million , ten million polyglot human beings of different nations and religions may swarm within it . A crowd itself attracts a crowd ; and the proletariat ? the floating masses of the poor , without roots in the soil or social cohesion ? will prefer poverty in a great city where at least something may always turn up , to mechanised agricultural labour in a thinned , homeless , and cheerless countryside . Intellectually , too , a great city is more stimulating . Opinions , like dress , speech , and manners , are brought by commerce into the melting pot : intellectual fashions arise , rule , and disappear quickly by an irresistible contagion . To-day they may be carried in a moment , by radio , all over the world ; whereas in a society without foreign commerce , they would be persistent locally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be provincial in time . The airy force of novelty is soon deflated , like spent foam in the trough of the sea . Thus under commercial domination useful arts become mechanical , and fine arts a chaos of whims and fashions . The Reformation , in contrast with the Renaissance , is instructive in this respect . Both were contemptuous of mediaeval art , science and piety . When Luther pours scorn on the monks in his old monastery , he does not accuse them of being corrupt ( as we are usually told that monasteries had become ) but of being devout and credulous . Yet he himself , in his disordered zeal , remained blindly credulous in spots , and deeply religious in the midst of riot . Concentration on the Epistles of St. Paul had given him the temporary political advantage of seeming more orthodox than the Pope , and of appealing to heated religious minds like his own , incapable of taking a philosophic view of tradition . Yet the permanent advantage and ultimate reward of the Reformation was to secularise society without emancipating it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while making this business soundly mundane and prosperous . The Renaissance , on the contrary , had been humanistic , aesthetic , and truly scientific in inspiration , however fanciful science might still have been amongst Platonising or necromantic enthusiasts . These humanists laughed at austerity and orthodoxy , or hated  | them as trammels to their arts and to the free play of speculation . A political alliance was not impossible at times between the fanatics , the humanists , and the ruling class , feudal or commercial : they could unite in pillaging the Church . In this alliance it was humanism that was most compromised : because the fanatics and the new-rich were both interested in tightening the reins of morality , imposing soberness and fidelity to duty , and suppressing imagination and the free joys of life . Humanism might have been crushed altogether between the upper and the nether millstone , had not the merchants drawn the line at the sacrifice of their private pleasures : so that Lutheran Holland and Germany in the seventeenth century retained much of their jollity . The early Renaissance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate ; manners were courtly , food succulent and long draughts out of magnificent tankards frequently repaired the ravages of business toil and care . In England the Restoration issued in a characteristic and happy compromise between tradition and reform , between commercialism and aristocracy . Education for the upper classes remained down to our day entirely classical and humanistic ; but the taste and intelligence fed by this schoolboy knowledge were soon applied , not ungracefully , to imperial affairs . The Army and the Church retained their respective mentalities , not utilitarian in tone ; nevertheless ultimate control of the Church and the Army , and over the mind of the nation , lay always , as it lies to-day , in the hands of commerce . During the nineteenth century archaistic affectations in art and religion float sentimentally in the upper air , whilst legislation and war pursue commercial advantage with implacable instinct . The traditional parties owe at bottom no other allegiance than allegiance to money , diplomatically called the national interest ; the only internal question being in what proportion the money shall be distributed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error to suppose that , like certain other nations , they set their heart ultimately on the liberties or glories talked about by their orators ; these unrealities are exchangeable , provisional , and only means to the great end , prosperity . Why must the expensive British Navy be kept up ? To protect the routes of commerce and , by retaining the colonies , to enable the country to keep up an establishment and a population far exceeding its home resources . And how can the Church be justified ? Because its elastic theology and agreeable ritual  | help to keep up the moral tone of the nation , and according to Eddington and Jeans are not contrary to science , that is , to the technical calculations necessary for industry . INSTABILITY OF COMPOUND UNITS WHEN people make a tool , like an axe , they are not surprised if after a little , the edge grows dull , or the handle loose . Wood and iron are brought artificially together , and called an axe by virtue of the use they acquire in that conjunction . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retain that life fully while called an axe ; and they continue it afterwards when , being broken up and released from their incidental function , they form an axe no longer . In such a case the independent nature of the materials is obvious , and the precarious and external way in which they remain effectively an axe is plain to those who must be continually sharpening and repairing old axes and making new ones . On the other hand , when what possesses a useful function is not artificial but grows up spontaneously , like the eye or the liver , like language or religion or government , people are apt to forget that in these compounds , too , substance has a life of its own , quite independent of the ends it may be expected to serve when called by these names . Chemically and psychologically the underlying life goes on uninterruptedly , as that of the wood and the iron does in the axe . But as a man never makes his eye or his liver , he may easily ignore ( until he becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may even forget that they have a material substance at all . In language he notices the meaning , not the sound nor the complicated inflexions and extraordinary syntax . In religion he recognises divine authority or saving grace , not any human inventions , hypotheses , and confused traditions which , when they seem to exercise that religious function , are called religion . Only when his eyes see double , or his liver refuses to work , only  | when in language or religion he finds what he calls error , does he observe , with no little astonishment , that these names cover natural facts and processes existing on their own account , with a mechanism and a tendency absolutely independent of the service which they may occasionally have done him ; and that it is no more marvellous that they should go their own way to his chagrin and discomfiture than that an axe should grow dull or fall to pieces in his hand . Unintelligent surprise at the essential automatism and irresponsible life of organs that , to a greedy and self-centred Will , seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of government . People expect that a government should operate simply for their complete convenience . Not only when it taxes , dragoons , imprisons , enslaves , ruins , or exterminates them , but when in any measure it makes for results which they do not desire , they are full of astonishment and indignation , and look for some diabolical influence to explain the anomaly . Experience since the world began seems powerless here against the presumptions of egotism and ignorance , and against that rooted belief with which all animals seem to be born , that the world exists for their benefit . Nevertheless government , although it sometimes serves to protect , educate , or inspire a people , is in fact a material formation with an origin , life , and tendency of its own . The secret of its activity is its own impulses and not the eventual agreement of that impulse with the impulses of its individual subjects or of other societies . The mistakes of governments , and the fact that governments are often bad , obey the same causes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpened or replaced , so governments ( as liberal ages have discovered ) need to be constantly refreshed by criticism , by new elections , by revolts , by assassinations , and by other means of grinding their edge ; while in the end the only cure is to throw them away and call to life a wholly new government from out of the midst of the people . New axes , however , for all their newness are not disembodied and perfect instruments , with utility for their essence . Living wood and living iron ? men and their private interests ? are the inner substance of them ; and the external joints and wedges that keep these men and their private interests together are as fragile and mortal , as incapable of remaining for two days in the same posture , as is the flux of matter itself , which being the substance of all things  | keeps them all continually growing old and being reproduced with odd variations . The substance of a government is the men in office : but the life of a government ? its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social and even moral life of its members . These men become a government by a partial conjunction of their minds and actions . There is only an abstract relation or occasional union of each of them with the others , such as among members of the same opera troupe . As members of a government they have certain interests , passions , and morality which they would never have had as private men . This new element in each is in its quality common to them all : and the mutual contagion of this common impulse strengthens very much the official soul in all the officials . Let not the reader vaguely imagine that this common element in associated persons is a new and superior person , of a mystical , logical , or hyper-psychological sort , a common mind that possesses interests without having an animal body or an individual consciousness . The common medium in which the associated persons move and which hypnotises them into sharing the same impulses and emotions ( in so far as they do so ) is a natural medium ? namely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government they take up . They acquire the habits , taboos , and accepted maxims of the new society they move in , or of such part of it as touches them . This material environment , where it contains persons , is of course animate , and these persons have emotions and ideas of their own ; but it is only by material channels that these souls are betrayed to one another ? or can have any mutual influence ; so that the social medium , regarded as a hypnotic power and source of contagion , is thoroughly physical . The governmental mind is simply so much of the mind of each member of the government as is subject to these common material influences , and is therefore very like the simultaneous movement of the other members ' minds . I am far from wishing to deny that many minds may entertain identical views , in the sense of employing the same logical terms . But a logical term is not a mind ; an object of thought is not a natural object or historic event but an ideal theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds to which such essences are manifest has its own currents and accompaniments , independent in existence and movement from those of the other minds concerned : so that  | the minds are not in the least one mind , though they may be swayed by the same influence , and may coincide in the same dogmas . This common strain , in times of great excitement and close cooperation , may swell remarkably and submerge for the moment those other strains which are different in quality in each of the minds concerned ; and the consequent howling and rushing unanimity of the mob ? for governments at certain junctions are like mobs ? may be poetically called the movement of a single Will ; as the froth of a thousand waves , whipped up by the same wind , might be called the fury of a single tempest . All , however , is not false idealism in politics ; and members of a government acquire another faculty besides imitative imagination and supplementary to the contagious social side of their humanity . They acquire a corporate instinct of self-preservation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passions , and necessities , quite irrelevant to the public good , but most influential over public affairs . Quite apart from obsession with party policy , which after all is something verbally noble , a government is wedded to itself , to its own material inertia and effort at equilibrium . Its own life is its first concern ; for if it did not endure , how could it work for its political cause , or serve the country it has been called upon to rule ? It must first of all maintain its cohesion , and abound in inward strength ; then its relations to other interests can be looked into at leisure . What will not a government do in order not to fall , or in order so to fall as to be able to rise again ? Long after the delight of giving direction and the hope of realising cherished ideas have been clouded over with sordid business and anxious expectations , the fear of defeat still keeps them at work . To cease governing involves such painful changes of intellectual speed , of executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of income , and of residence ! Moreover , it is a defeat in the game ; it is as unpleasant , as tenaciously resisted , as checkmate at chess . Such a government is a parasite . Like any organ in an animal body , it is a sort of knot or carbuncle formed in the flesh : a little organism in the larger one , with its own centre and circulation , its own instincts of recuperation and work , feeding on the common blood , and supplying the body with a new local sensitiveness , a new motor faculty , and a new point open to attack . This parasite is sometimes convenient , sometimes inconvenient , sometimes fatal . The society which it dominates will therefore  | judge it differently according as its special interests are affected by it ; for some it may be useful , for others oppressive and odious . But the balance of these judgments will not trouble its conscience , as if it were a government professing to coordinate and advance all the interests of its subjects ; that would seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a true master in the art of constructing and directing governments . To rule , for a master , would be a militant enterprise , free and spontaneous , as for the superman of Nietzsche . Like the liberal arts this enterprise would be autonomous and inspired only by the inward vision of a perfect work to be constructed ; but unlike the liberal arts , it would choose living creatures to be trained and shaped after its arbitrary Will and ideal . Like the liberal arts , therefore , it would be capable of fixity in its principles ; but like any other order imposed on an aggregate of natural units , its works would be insecure , and its own existence in constant peril . DOMINATION AS AN ART MACHIAVELLI in his treatise The Prince chooses to regard every ruler as animated only by the Will to Rule and to describe the policy that this incarnate abstraction should pursue in order to maintain his position . The result is that nothing appears except a pack of unprincipled princes playing the game of diplomatic war . In the classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be included ; but the militant art of imposing a precise regimen on others is less unnatural and has not only been often preached but sometimes successfully practiced . The best-known instance is Sparta , and some Moslem and some ancient Asiatic despotisms exhibit it also . Here it is not primarily treacherous neighbours that preoccupy the commander but rather the faithful under his authority . He is concerned above all for the Law of which he has made himself the prophet or the guardian . He may be , and usually is in the beginning , the chief of only a small band ; and he may- not aspire to universal dominion or care anything for the fate  | of the multitude of the outsiders , the heathen , the barbarians , or the rabble at his own door . He may even , like the Spartans and the ancient Hebrews , be proud and jealous of the singular , the difficult virtue of his people , its incommunicable superiority : and this , if circumstances permitted , would easily pass into a dream of universal empire . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather on home discipline than on conquests or numbers . Such at least was the case of Sparta . Amid chequered fortunes intrepidly borne , there had always been a great aridity of spirit in the Spartans themselves and an occasional marked weakness under personal temptation when abroad ; and finally a ghostly survival , under Roman benevolence , of the forms of Lycurgus ' republic covering an inglorious impotence . The military Orders of the Mediaeval West were somewhat similar in ethos , although the militancy here , as among the Moslems , was religious at least in theory and the field not a single Greek city but the whole world to conquer , garrison , and convert , and ever after to be dominated from castles or abbeys on every hilltop . There was far more disorder and licence than in Spartan campaigning , but also a Christian and chivalrous desire to propagate to all mankind the spiritual essence of Christian loyalty , something shown again , in both its aspects , in the Spanish conquests over seas , and in their permanent traces in the conquered populations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocratic governments , exhibited first by the Greek overflow into innumerable colonies , and in the conquests and foundations of Alexander , as well as in Roman works everywhere at a later date : I mean the imposing labours designed to make the earth 's surface safer , more fruitful , and more worthy of its human masters . All this was partly , no doubt , a financial speculation ; it was always militant enterprise rather than faction ; yet the spirit of dignity and beauty in form , and of perennial civilisation in intent , dominated the calculation , and mixed magnanimity with the thirst for tribute . When the modern world began to take shape after the great migrations , with the rapid conquests of Islam and the gradual hardening of the feudal organisation of Europe , there was no occasion for any political regime to become a militant force on its own account . Governments were accidental growths out of extinct institutions and novel rights assumed , and duties imposed by force . The enterprise of governing the lives of men morally , according to a  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a model of human virtue and art , passed to the ecclesiastical authorities , that drew it from the piety of the Hebrews and the philosophy of the Greeks . Yet , unlike either of these sources , both the Christian and the Moslem authorities were unflinchingly militant . By disputation , zealous education , and on occasion by war , these religions were to be imposed and preserved in unchallenged domination ; or if the temerity of unbelievers or of rebellious sects could not be overcome , they might be allowed to exist , but unarmed and cast into the shade by a resplendent establishment . These great religions were militant , but in a war of imagination . As the Greeks sometimes invoked friendship as an incentive to courage in war , so the religions with supernatural claims sometimes invoked enterprise or war or science as a provisional support ; but it was successful only in introducing the faith to astonished and uncritical masses , as the first followers of Mohammed did in Asia and North Africa , or the Spaniards in parts of America . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially keen , it can be easily filled with any appealing fiction ; but no material or social force will bend it when it already has its syntax and prosody well rooted and tried . The greatest force of propaganda for the imagination is example , habituation , and rooted attachment to special types of belief . As circumstances cause the balance of this psychic influence to vary in a given population , or this population to come under fresh influences , the hold of its traditional religion will be variously transformed , as well as the susceptibility of that population to alien religions . During the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth I happen to have had occasion to observe at close quarters the movement of public sentiment , in five different countries ? Spain , the United States , England , France , and Italy ? in regard to philosophy and religion , especially in regard to the Catholic Church . At first doctrinaire intolerance prevailed ( among advocates of political toleration as much or more vigorous than among its opponents ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boasting of their past prevalence or sure future dominion . 1n regard to religion and philosophy , though there was much prejudice there was little faith ; living faith was concentrated on science , liberalism , and progress . It was only in Germany , and in the vogue in academic circles elsewhere of German philosophy , that any dif-  | ferent view prevailed in regard to history and politics ; but of that I had only perfunctory knowledge . Only recently , the two German wars and the sudden Russian threat of universal domination have proved that the classic tradition , passing through the German philosophy of history , drawn from the Bible , inspired the Russian Revolution and guides , most unexpectedly , a militant art of government intended to dominate the world . A patient reader of these pages need not be told that in my opinion the course of events obeys the generative order of nature , and not any militant revolt , following the mirage of a humanistic or moralistic ideology . If the communist conspiracy succeeded it would not establish anything permanent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human psyche . Meantime an incidental illustration of this process may be seen in the change that has occurred since the 187o 's in public sentiment towards science and religion . While the application of science to mechanical uses has become more and more wonderful , and has disclosed fields of complexity and power unsuspected in the depths of matter , the tone of proud finality in science that its popular leaders had assumed earlier has given place to modesty . But meantime speculation in mathematical terms invaded the principles of physics , with a grand air of undermining them . In physics , however , validity attaches to experiment , not to language . Language serves the humanities better . History and archaeology in particular have much enlarged their investigations , and acquired a respect for ages , races , and philosophies , as well as arts , that were formerly despised as barbarous . And this moral tolerance has extended to the non-scientific religions and philosophies that come down into our times from antiquity , notably the Indian and Chinese , and the Catholic and Orthodox Churches among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Catholics if they choose , without losing at all the respect of the public or of their own professional circle , for science is felt to be merely a language expressing the sides of the universe that human observation , in its present phase , is able to plot and to predict ; while the realm of imagination is felt to be omnimodal so that the cultivation of one method or aim by no means condemns the cultivation , at other times or in other circles , of some different method . And this liberality might well be extended to methods of government , if only the adherents of each could be peacefully segregated and had the  | courage to practice their chosen antics at home , without arming to destroy their neighbours for practicing , in excelsis , a different acrobatic art . DISSOLUTION OF THE ARTS IN THE great ages of art nobody talked of aesthetics . Doubtless there was lively criticism of each new tragedy or temple or cathedral ; every innovation was hotly discussed by the craftsmen and by the public , and divided them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no break with tradition , no thought of irrelevant new beginnings or creations ex nihilo . The arts were only skilled and decorative ways of doing what , for other reasons , had to be done ; skilled and decorative ways of making pots , clothes , and houses , of speaking and persuading , of praying and dancing . Things had to be made beautiful for the use of the great , and for the honour of the soul . The great could be themselves beautiful ; and so were the grand occasions , the feasts , processions , and games , in which major works of art were displayed and admired . The artist was the servant , the studious contriver , of these public splendours ; and in the public enthusiasm he forgot himself and joined in applauding the wonders that Minerva and the Muses had accomplished through his guided hands . In modern times , even before the French Revolution , nations became too large and unwieldy to inspire the arts or to enjoy them in common . Moreover , tradition was divided between a stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Art still had patrons , and therefore still had some consistency ; the great in their palaces and country seats demanded a certain semiprivate splendour ; and they possessed a certain semi-private tradition which they called good taste . They might even be connoisseurs , and collect paintings and statues . This was an omen of the end : for works of art now were prized as curiosities , detachable and detached . Soon the expert reviewed them with a knowing smile , related anec-  | dotes about the alleged artist , compared them with Chinese or African specimens , and meantime in his own house allowed some wholesale establishment to furnish him with all his belongings . The artists , on their side , became superior persons , contemptuous of the stupid public and the traditional styles . They strove to be original , called themselves creative , and kept themselves before the public , which might have gladly ignored them , by praising themselves extravagantly , and outraging good sense in their works and often in their lives . All the arts ? except perhaps architecture ? have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Is this a gain in dignity ? Is there a deeper inspiration in breaking loose from the world and plumbing the secret sensibility of one 's own organism ? Perhaps it is incidental to democracy to eschew patronage of any sort , and rely only on what the average loose individual can discover in his insulated self-consciousness . And certainly the democratic public respects the self-advertising artist and gives him free rein , as an ancient city or an aristocratic society would never have done . The artist now belongs to the Intelligentsia , which feels itself to be a sort of aristocracy ; whereas formerly he passed for a worthy artisan , perhaps a singular genius , but never for a lord of life . The true lords of life were , and perhaps always will be , the men of action , the masters of things , the directors of political events . This is as inevitable in a democracy as under a military monarchy . Put a lot of human beings , presumably equal , into a camp ; enforce peace ; forbid bullying ; stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who dominates the community . Will it be the poets ? Will it be the painters ? Will it be the devout ? Will it be the learned ? No ; it will be the athletes , the riders , the huntsmen , the explorers . These will not only give direction by virtue of greater competence and quickness , but also by virtue of the general admiration and trust which they inspire . They inspire such confidence justly ; not because they are at all infallible or even very sagacious , but because in their rough , prejudiced , and empirical way they deal with realities ; whereas those other mental people , who think themselves superior , stop at ideas , and remain entangled each in his own subjective world . Your true aristocrat is not without a play life of his own ; he is a sportsman ; and incidentally he may like to surround himself with a noble setting , in which it will be natural to live nobly . In this the  | artists and the priests may serve him , if they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a qualified deference , not venturing , perhaps , to quarrel with them on their own ground , but taking their measure smilingly in his own mind , and reserving his manly freedom . As the Sabbath was made for man , so the fine arts , he thinks , were made for the gentleman : a feeling that was charmingly mirrored in English art and literature so long as England remained officially aristocratic . But now that every emancipated prig creates his theology , why should n't he also create his art ? The aesthete armed with his supercilious sensibility and transcendental freedom , intrudes into the workshop of the arts with his nose in the air ; but he remains an amateur in his craft , plays a game of bluff with the public ( a game which for a time is often successful ) , but dwindles and soon vanishes from the scene in consequence of his inherent vacuity . For the arts , after all , draw their life-blood from a well-digested craftsman 's tradition . But the aesthete , posing in his studio , despises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flits from one experiment to another until perhaps his extravagances bring him round full circle to the most primitive conventions . There , by touching bottom and recovering the rudiments , he may really renovate his art and develop it in harmony with the new necessities of society ; but the danger is that instead of serving the public and helping them to recognise and refine their natural feelings , he may attempt to stimulate in himself some unprecedented emotion , and may waste his cleverness in abusing mankind for not appreciating his folly . Indeed , the public is not blameless in this dissolution of the arts ; it too has become aesthetic ; it too has taken to gathering collections and building museums . A genuine lover of the beautiful would never enter a museum . There the historian might find the sediment which the stream of intuition in the past had deposited as it flowed ; and perhaps during the study of those relics , some intuitions of the beautiful might be awakened in his own mind , delightful but evanescent . The artist , the poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily unintentional aspects of nature and action that he draws his inspiration . The arts , especially the active practice of the arts , will also awaken in him living intuitions ; the scene about him may be full of artificial as well as of natural objects , and both equally make up his native world , he being inevitably merged in the atmosphere of their uses and associations . Antiquity , like  | autumn , has the poetic quality of lost youth , the charm of patina , of ruins , of unrecoverable titanic passions . Even the connoisseur , surrounded by his bibelots , may be a poet ; he may occasionally catch a glimpse of the fine modish beauty proper to these trifles in their day , when the sun shone upon them . He might , if he had a living and organic imagination of his own , make an epic or an elegy out of those vistas . But this would be a new , a modern , art crossing , and reflecting upon , the arts that are dead ; it would not be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spontaneous artist , the young poet who runs singing home , full of irrepressible inspiration and planning marvellous works , cares for no art but his own . He works in the vernacular , he ruminates on images he can not banish , because they are the substance of his life . That which is politely called beautiful leaves him cold : the really beautiful hides from him behind the sad or trivial or horrible visions that existence forces upon him ; and his art is to draw out and weave it into a tapestry for the eyes of the spirit . The history of art is nothing to him : his art is a fresh image of inescapable things . THE DECLINE OF THE GREAT POWERS IT Is not the little powers or any revival of provincial life that threatens the pride and freedom of the great powers ; it is the hideous entanglement and moral vacancy of their own governments . England , for instance , in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , acted the great power with conviction ; she was independent , mistress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Difficulties and even defeats , such as the loss of the American Colonies , did not in the least daunt her ; her vitality at home and her liberty abroad remained untouched . But gradually , though she suffered no final military defeat , the heart seemed to fail her for so vast an enterprise . It was not the colonies she had lost that maimed her , but those she had retained or annexed . Ireland , South Africa ,  | and India became thorns in her side . The bloated industries which helped her to dominate the world made her incapable of feeding herself ; they committed her to forced expansion , in order to secure markets and to secure supplies . But she could no longer be warlike with a good conscience ; the virtuous thing was to bow one 's way out and say : My mistake . Her kings were half-ashamed to be kings , her liberals were half-ashamed to govern , her Church was halfashamed to be Protestant . All became a medley of sweet reasonableness , stupidity , and confusion . Being a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce responsibility , to reduce armaments , to refer everything to conferences , to support the League of Nations , to let everyone have his own way abroad , and to let everyone have his own way at home . Had not England always been a champion of liberty ? But was n't it time now for the champion to retire ? And would n't liberty be much freer without a champion ? The other great powers , for abdicating more unwillingly , have not avoided the same fate ; they are embarrassed by greater inertia or rebellion at home , and by the same tangle abroad . The brave pose of Germany in 1914 , in the old manner of great powers , after a military failure and a sham quiescence , had a terrible sequel : and everyone suffered from general paralysis , industrial and moral . There was in various quarters a ferocious propaganda of philosophical nationalism , or philosophical communism ; there was industrial unrest ; but the great powers were completely impotent before the international stalemate of all their real ambitions . Patriotism attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally different passions , the love of home and the pride of empire . The love of home is topographical , climatic , moral ; it is intertwined with the myths and poetry of a nation , with personal affections , and with the comfort and assurance of moving in a familiar world , where you are master and where you may shine . This domestic attachment has little to do with government , and nothing to do with war . But when home is a city , and this city is at the head of an independent state , foreign policy and war may become the great affairs of the market-place ; they may supply the chief excitements of civic and even of private life . So in ancient and mediaeval city-states ; and the modern great power is an enlarged and monstrous version of the same double association . To the love of one 's home landscape and home ways ? a natural and innocent  | love ? the pride of empire , the gamble of war , the lust and vanity of competition are added ; and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as peasants had ) and perhaps without religion , the sporting passion for what they call their country ? that is , for the prestige of their government ? a passion fed by the newspapers , like the passion for football matches , carries all before it . But only for the nonce . A different propaganda in the press , a different appeal to senseless vanity may suddenly turn that government of theirs ( as they call it ) into the supposed enemy of their class and their persons . The pride of empire , the zeal for victory , which were their ruling passions the day before , may seem the day after most wicked delusions ; and since these modern masses have no home , and hardly a nationality , no natural patriotism may subsist to keep them from being blown by a wordy blast like so much bran in the wind . The pride of empire , in the Romans or in Englishmen of the old school , was an aristocratic passion , almost a bond of duty : and it went beautifully with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national character , deeply saturated with home influences and strictly limited in its virtues , enabled them to explore and govern the most outlandish regions , and even to spend their lives there , without dropping one iota of their native orthodoxy ; and their function in governing abroad , though it may unintentionally have spread their language and manners in certain quarters , was really in the nature of paid services rendered to the foreigner , with no desire to assimilate him . He was not worthy or capable of being assimilated , and a fool if he attempted it ; but he might be initiated into certain material arts and positive sciences , for him to combine as best he might with his own traditions , or in the case of the uncivilised native , with his own temperament . Empire building may be conceived as a sort of lay missionary work , under military protection ; and the army and the government that undertake it no doubt feel and perhaps ought to feel a great pride in the work . It is a big business ; there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes to be made . But now the big business of being a great power has perhaps outlived its function . That function was entirely distinct from natural home patriotism ; the latter is attachment of a mind with roots to the roots which it has , the love of home in those who have a home . But the big business of imperialism had better be relegated to some non-sentimental au-  | thority , less sentimental perhaps than the League of Nations , capable of discerning and enforcing a material equilibrium in the world . If this authority were that of one of the great powers , the first requisite for success would be to wash away all local patriotism from the minds of those universal rulers so that in obeying them the world might believe that it was free , and might truly be so , in everything in which freedom is a good . NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL ALLEGIANCE IN A city , or near it , free men once had their birthplace , their residence ; and so had all their known ancestors , relations , and acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their military fortunes , and their festivals and sports . If it was ever in peril , they were in equal peril too , and they normally prospered in its prosperity . It was familiar to them in its entirety , and they knew all its principal men by sight , and heard their orations . And it was as citizens of that city that , if by chance they ever left it , they were known and judged by the rest of the world . If we ask ourselves how so close and lasting a political society had arisen , I think we should have to consider various alternatives or perhaps converging or successive causes of growth . A village grows up at the place where paths cross in any inhabited region , and it is there that fairs are held , inns opened , and temples built . That would be growth by virtue of economic convenience or necessity . But when instead of a village we find a defended town , though walls are not in themselves signs of militant enterprise , they may indicate that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find it necessary to entrench themselves in their cave or their stronghold against probable reprisals ; and then we should see the city as a by-product of militant adventure on a large and permanent scale . A great city would be the nest of a numerous and permanent association of bandits . And this would be confirmed by the relation which the citizens of the city had to the peasants in the  | surrounding country , even if these , and their chiefs , were also legally citizens . The elders in the city , probably heirs to parcels of the original city lanes , would be heavily armed , perhaps mounted on war horses or chariots , and altogether irresistible for the shepherds or sailors , woodcutters or miners . There would be also many artisans in the city , whose sons might be regular soldiers , or light-armed auxiliaries . Thus we should be in the presence of a complete military and aristocratic organisation , perhaps with a King or High Priest at its head . This would have been a city built up and existing to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over minor cities akin to it . Beyond this limited and easily cancelled expansion a purely military city-state like Sparta was not likely to go ; its ambition was not at all to conquer or convert the world , but like a race of hunters or athletes or Pythagorean philosophers , to lead together a severe , brave , and simple life , in contempt alike of the voluntary slave who drudged and hoarded , or the fool with his absurd passions and unnecessary sorrows . This was an essentially moral , or more specifically , an ascetic enterprise , but having the form of a complete human polity , not a separated private society , like a monastic order ; it included marriage , political independence , and domination over slaves and helots and a selected friendship in the surrounding political world , with action in the necessary wars . But it was not a faction either political or religious or moral , because it aspired to live its own disciplined life without attempting to diffuse it . Singularity was its pride and disdain of wealth and knowledge its weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that it might in each of them become heroic and godlike , all the more for standing , like a bronze statue in the midst of a swarm of howling and hiding beasts . Why did Athenians , like Socrates and Plato , immediately after the age of Pericles , as well as the conservatives all over Greece , look with admiration towards this artificial barbarism ? No doubt because they felt the corruption and inevitable decline of their own country , and of all its liberal glory . But why this corruption and decadence ? Consider the contrast with Rome , never in the least Spartan , and yet at that time , by its military and administrative endurance and genius , beginning to dominate the world . Why had Athens , that had repulsed the immense Persian Empire , failed against corrupt Syracuse and meagre Sparta , when Rome was des-  | tined to destroy utterly the formidable military empire of Carthage ? Rome , like Carthage and Athens , was an imperial city-state ; it was not , like Persia , a conquering tribe or nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of wars of growth rather than imagination or enthusiasm . But the empires of citystates , except that of Rome , were based on commerce and consequent wealth , which a prevalently naval force extended and protected . Roman enterprise had always been political , not economic , and its conquests were made on land , after which a navy was established to protect the commerce in the Mediterranean , for economic objects , not as a . help to extend commercial adventures . Commerce , no doubt , served luxury too , during the Roman decadence , and in the Byzantine empire , but in Rome the wealth that supported its luxury was still landed wealth . This makes all the difference in the stability of empire and in its moral solidity . A Venice may be long prosperous and beautiful , but with a meretricious and theatrical beauty . Such , among the Greeks , had been the character of Corinth and Syracuse ; but Athens had an early history of internal growth and political discipline , which gave to its imperial enterprise a nucleus of political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , which British administration preserved even in governing foreign peoples , and its colonists carried with them wherever they migrated . But the most sudden and fruitful of military enterprises , having such a moral nucleus , have been those of Alexander and of Islam . Alexander 's enterprise was not arbitrary . The whole history of Ilerodotus , dedicated to the nine Muses , gives its traditional grounds . It was a war to secure safety for Greece ; and in its victory it never thought of peopling all Asia with Greeks , but was content to turn it into a friendly and enlightened empire . The Greeks succeeded in transforming a part of Asia , until the Moslem or even the Turkish conquest , into a Hellenised world . And the Moslem conquest , especially in Mesopotamia , Persia , and Spain , revived spontaneously , in a novel and delicate form , the elegance of the 1lellenic arts and manners , without any hostility to the larger spiritual inspiration proper to Asia itself . Yet there are always seeds of futility in artifice ; a foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations of forgetful heirs of the old world and refractory pupils of the new have generated an unwitting hybrid that feels itself young and  | original . This occurs rarely . What happened in the Hellenised east was that the Hellenic and Christian elements were submerged by Islam , except in Byzantium itself and the native Greek territories ; and that almost nothing of the Arab or Moorish civilisation survived in Spain ; while even in the Arab countries it is now helplessly struggling under European and Jewish pressure that prevents it from knowing what it wants . Is a convinced and unadulterated Islam again capable of exercising dominion in economics and in culture ? That is somewhat as if we asked whether the Catholicism of the thirteenth or that of the seventeenth century was again capable of dominating Western Europe and modern America . But the subject of religious enterprises and their fate is a large one and deserves separate treatment . MILITANT RELIGIONS PAGANISM is aptly described by the Germans as " natural " religion , in the sense that it is not artificial , but grows up unobserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is contagious , and the gestures , local cults , and stories of wonders and visions , are seen and heard , as they are enacted or repeated , with a sense that some magic or numinous influence envelops them . But these cults are local and ritualistic ; the myths that are suggested by them are freely varied , and essentially poetical and fabulous . The sources of these magic influences are represented sometimes as animals , sometimes as human beings , but always more elusive in their substance and apparition . They are therefore splendid subjects for myths and for oracular admonitions , representing secret fears or hopes of perturbed minds . When the growth of natural religion of this kind has become complex and precise in any people , critics will not be someday wanting that will criticise that fantastic tradition , either deriding it altogether as moonshine , or denouncing some elements in it as unworthy of others , which are declared sacred .  | The complete sceptics have little political importance , although they never cease to reappear sporadically , or in little groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and the contrary errors of mankind disastrous . Local pagan deities and rites may sincerely respect one another ; but when zealous souls , far from abandoning their traditional religion , undertake to reform or transform it , so as to render it true and perfect , then faith in it becomes militant and the practice and advocacy of it a positive social enterprise . The previously innocent pagan practices and doctrines , having now challenged and condemned all others , must take up arms in at least verbal defence of their singular claims . Here we have a Church Militant ; but that is only a forced and incidental turn of private zeal , and rather poisons than purifies the positive , poetical , ascetic , and spiritual side of pagan worship . Moreover , it is a dangerous procedure for the fundamental tenets which are assumed by both sides in such a controversy ; because the arguments and evidences invoked against the heretics may very easily be applied eventually to the orthodoxy that they retain , and thereby also to the foundations of the conservative position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-purifications , sudden new inspirations , and ultimate unforeseen alternative results may be studied to unparalleled advantage in the Book of Genesis and in the whole Bible , including the origin of the Christian Church ; to which the history of Islam and of Protestantism can be easily appended . The other great religions in Egypt , Mesopotamia , India , and China seem not to have been militant , although their philosophers sometimes advocate sharply their personal moral sentiments or schemes of salvation , as if no other was possible . l lowever this may be , I think the lesson of these oriental religions may be gathered by philosophy better than by any theological eclecticism ; and what is philosophy , as the governance and appreciation of life , except religion liberated from groundless fear or anxiety , that is to say from superstition , and also from rage at honest illusions ? Now , the Hebrews , or Children of Abraham , were not at all Orientals in being given to speculation , but an ordinary nomadic tribe with a tribal patron . It is intelligible that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , but rather to the fortunes of his People . Changes in their fortunes would be due to  | their right or wrong conduct towards their God , who yet would lead the faithful in the end to conquer and possess for ever a land flowing with milk and honey . For this tribe had never , as far as their traditions reported their past , lived in the depths of Arabia or in the vast wilderness of Central Asia , but rather on . the borders of highly civilised and populous nations , like Babylonia and Egypt . They exchanged their pastoral produce for the grain and luxuries of those countries , and in these contacts they would have heard , perhaps with wonder , of their cosmic speculations and cosmic deities . The Hebrews were too tightly bound to the worship of their one celestial patron ( for it was there that he sometimes appeared and from there that he spoke to them ) to be attracted to those strange gods and their monstrous images ; and they had never much regarded the gods of other nations except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the power and will of Jehovah to protect them always . Yet those stories of the creation of the world and of the universal flood , and the notion of a deity ruling all nature and all nations may well have impressed them ; so much so that , attributed to their own God , they could accept them without disloyalty . For how , indeed , could Jehovah control the fortunes of his People unless he was master also of all other nations and all other gods ? And in that case it became sacrilege even for these other nations to worship any god but the God of Abraham and of Isaac who had appeared to Jacob and made with him at Bethel that memorable contract . It must be , in fine , the whole universe that was guided and planned for the glory and for the chastisement of Israel . All nations were destined to recognise him , and the special authority of his People and his Law ; so that Israel by right of divine grace was the one appointed teacher and master of all mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that right effective . It is only by a slight and automatic change of locus and names that this formidable doctrine has passed to the two international and interracial religions that , as religions , are derived from Israel : Christianity and Islam , which , in the claim to supernatural universal authority , are continuations of Judaism . Yet these two , by their diversified and much richer contacts with the gentile world , have become social , political , and moral forms of culture no less than of religion . Islam in particular , although initially a religious gospel , at once became a military mission of conquest and domination , with  | a special legislation , oriental and sub-tropical in character , to be imposed on all believers ; and belief itself was to be imposed on pain of death on all conquered peoples , unless being Jews or Christians , they were already " men of the Book " and could be tolerated and protected in their special faiths , though not admitted to military or judicial functions . This system produced a special civilisation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later several centuries .. of wide but sleepy and imperfect domination under the Turks . But a militant religion is an embarrassing heritage for nations compelled to live under the tense , noisy , and restless pressure of the modern world ; although if this pressure subsides , oases might remain in the desert where that rare seed might again take root and come to flower . Israel itself , although so strictly tribal , has found it easy to spread all over the world ; but its tribal pride , deepened more than shaken by its sufferings , has prevented it either from merging with the gentiles or from gathering them in large numbers into its own pale . The truth is that their religion , after its two chief treasures , monarchical theism and the Scriptures , have been incorporated in other religions , remains distinctive enough , by its exclusions , to segregate them in the midst of a modern society that they love , but that is not distinctive enough , in its religion , to attract religious minds . And how many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got complete possession of Jerusalem , to rebuild the Temple of Solomon or even of Herod and to restore all its ornaments and ceremonies , with all the prescriptions , for private life , of the Book of Leviticus ? If you remove the cult in the Temple , the observance of the Sabbath and the Feasts , and the miraculous tales in the Bible , what would remain in Judaism that , say , Protestant Christianity does not contain , greatly expurgated and universalised ? Liberal Jews are simply humanitarians and positivists : the religion of Israel is for them what Catholicism was to Comte . The free-thinking modern Jew may be an artist , a capitalist , a philanthropist , or a communist : his militant soul has outgrown religion without finding philosophy or peace . The militant enterprise of the Catholic Church in the modern world is particularly interesting and instructive . Two different fountains , both springing up spontaneously in the human soul , itself a living compound of contraries , unite in inspiring and rationalising this religion . The first fountain is the pure doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of John the Baptist and the hermits in the desert or , when they turn towards mankind , in the homeless missionary little band of Jesus and his disciples ; which with the growth of numbers can not avoid special settlements in various cities , or in monasteries in the country , combining the little necessary tilling of the soil with much building and much praying . But evidently this truly evangelical life can be led only by a few selected communities , where each individual has heard a special call , and all are celibate , merely waiting for the second coming of the Lord , either publicly with trumpets , to judge the world and bring it to an end , or privately to each soul for its sanctification . The laity that is converted to this doctrine can not be required to reproduce its discipline ; but by the distinction between universal commandments and evangelical counsels , they will be encouraged to live in the spirit of chastity , poverty , and obedience as far as their station and duties in the world permit ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual as well as moral , so long as it is admitted to be weakness and not defended as manly and enlightened . Catholic morality is therefore easily compatible with any form of civil or military government that does not itself impose a different religion or morality , but attends to the things that are Caesar 's with a benevolent smile at the tastes of mankind in mystical matters . Even a hostile theocracy , if it recognised the Catholic minority as a separate People , and allowed them their own language , religion , education , and laws of marriage and inheritance , could be passively endured , without any rebellious impulses . But the position of a Catholic party in a modern constitutional democracy , where the majority has socialistic leanings and wants to organise , equalise , and train everybody , making them all unanimous , is a difficult and embarrassing one . Christianity is a revealed and militant religion . It would die out at once if it were not expressly inculcated ; and although its followers might be dragooned into a political party as they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under compulsion , reserving for their religion their only real allegiance . How genuinely and fruitfully Catholicism can be fused into a rich human civilisation becomes clear when we consider the other fountain of its inspiration , namely , Hellenism . And for Catholics this is not , as for Protestants , an appendage , almost a treason , to  | their Christianity , but a spontaneous , genial , and poetical way of being Christians . This is , in spirit , more marked in the Eastern Church where Hellenism is native than in the Western , although even here , through the Greek Fathers , Plato and Aristotle , it is no less traditional and even more warmly embraced and popular , as in the case of sacred ikons and statues . Into the Hebrew Scriptures themselves , after the conquests of Alexander had been divided into Hellenistic kingdoms , there appears a mature philosophy , freely speculative in Job and in Ecclesiastes , while in the Alexandrian Wisdom-books a salacious knowledge of the world . Nor did the Fathers and Apologists of the Church in the least hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cause , nor the Councils and the Popes to outdo the neo-Platonists in the refinements of theological speculation , or the other popular cults in the elaboration of pious legends and feasts . It was not by quitting their special revelation that Christians assimilated their piety to that of other men , but by introducing that same humanity into their own , as indeed was already done for them , radically and in principle , by the cardinal tenet of their faith , namely , the incarnation of God in Man . Humanism was in fact so deeply interfused with religion in the Catholic mind that it is precisely in the most Catholic ages that it flourished most and that a sort of paralysis fell on both , if either was muted . The ages of the Crusades were those of chivalry ; and Don Quixote felt no discord , but a mutual sanction , in being loyal to both at once . And yet a philological critic , spelling out his ideas from the letter of books , would have told him that chivalry , with its magic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fostering conceit , pride , and absurd combativeness in a clown masquerading as a hero . But Don Quixote , who read books with the imagination , would have replied : No ; no act could be more Christian than to defend the weak from the unjust aggression of the strong , and to turn the thoughts from carnal desires to an ideal and religious love . Compare with this the extraordinary cult of the Virgin Mary , inspired first by profound meditation on the mystery of the Incarnation , reported in the Gospels and itself the taproot of the Christian faith ; but this implication was fed and humanised by ambient religious sentiments regarding virginity and also motherhood , popular myths concerning the Mother of the  | Gods and Diana of the Ephesians and perhaps also by atavistic memories of matriarchal authority and government . And the vague mystical intuition of God in Man , latent everywhere , became concrete and at once homely and sacred , when concentrated in the figure of God in Jesus , and consequently hidden but actual , once in the womb and always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in a divine providence overruling the incidents of daily life , if even small favours could be mediated , as at the marriage in Cana , by a sigh at some domestic worry , or a tender sympathy with childish hearts . I doubt that , in any age , a mature philosophy can have avoided the conviction that it is such humble human models that the religious imagination has enlarged into propitious or hostile celestial giants , visiting angels , heroic Messiahs , mendicant prophets , and domestic wonderworking saints . But if Hellenism , in its devotion to the Theotokos , had made Hebraic religion at once speculative and humble , there could no longer be any quarrel between Christianity and interludes of gaiety , poetry , splendour , and refinement . These things can never be made pervasive or constant in human life , which can never radically control the physical world or its own irrational growths . But like religion itself , worldly fortunes can be cultivated at the right season in many various places and ways , of which Catholic civilisation gives brilliant though troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West , where the thirteenth century perfected ecclesiastical philosophy and architecture and the fifteenth century a pure renaissance which the seventeenth sublimated into majesty , magnificence , and baroque exuberance . There had been no lack of exuberance of other less monumental sorts throughout the middle ages . Heraldry shows it to the eye , spreading into costume , sculpture , romantic fabulous histories , and grotesque popular shows and the unbridled fancy of religious sects and speculations . Heresies were , indeed , often cruelly suppressed ; but chiefly when they involved social and political rebellion . Towards the ideal play of thought and language there was a great indulgence , and laughter rang as loud as the clash of arms and the screams and curses of the tortured . It was a rough existence , struggling and playing close to the ground ; but even in the persecutions which it authorised , religion was an exalting admonition from powers behind the scenes , in whose presence the passing passions lost their finality ; as ritual  | candles , at a wedding or at a funeral , lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into another world where it has another meaning ; much as the mention of ancient sorrows and glories by the chorus in a Greek play removes the too great horror of the present tragedy , together with all else that is accidental and transitory , into a realm where everything coexists and has become a perfect monument to itself . Certainly it is no relief to a man in agony to be told that the sky is sometimes blue and that the stars , though usually hidden , are always shining ; and these platitudes are no justification for the torments he suffers or for those who impose them . Existence is irrational and so is the love of it ; and while we exist we can not escape either . Yet a man has also a spirit capable of being speculative and disinterested whenever the pressure of hostile circumstances or vicious passions is relaxed . At such times , all things seem to speak to that spirit in its native language . Tragedies become poems ; the hopes and sorrows of the world become arguments for religion . Evils remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the spirit in him they are transformed ; what was a predicament becomes a vista , what was a puzzle becomes a truth . You have begun to live in a new way just as natural ( if you are a thinking man ) and much less disturbed . This is what society loses if it discards the liberal arts , or the liberating side of religion and philosophy . On their militant side , however , these speculative gifts and ideal systems only overload the weight of scientific and historical knowledge with arbitrary explanations which multiply unnecessary doubts and quarrels about optional doctrine and about groundless duties and prohibitions in action .  | THE STATUS OF REASON IN NATURE IN POLITICS reason may seem to play an eminently militant part , since when it can it introduces a moral order into the chaos of conflicting customs and quarrels . Yet a moment 's reflection will suffice to remind us that militancy itself is a strand in the generative order of society , an eddy in the stream , when one vital interest becomes vivid and turns against the smothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the integrity of a part asserting itself and seeking to dominate the blind drift of the rest . Now , such integrity in an insurgent Will is itself a triumph of reason and of vital liberty in the individual or the party girding itself for combat ; so that reason enters the political arena as an aggressive demand put forward by an eager agent whose Will , suddenly clarified , feels capable of achieving social domination . An oriental sage , however , might attain perfect integrity and rationality without growing in the least militant or figuring in politics as a reformer . The itch to make war on a drifting world would have to arise in him irrationally , as a heaven-sent mission or a political passion . Reason by no means requires a man to set about making rational those things which are irrational by nature , as life itself is . Don Quixote was kindly and heroically mad , but he had lost his reason . A rational order of society must be imposed on it by art , by express institutions and laws which presuppose birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perpetual fringe of madness and crime surrounding the fortified oasis of reason . And the needful agent in building and defending this fortress can never be reason itself but some sworn band of militant enthusiasts in whom the idea of a rational society has become an obsession . The primary force in establishing a rational order of society is therefore a purely vegetative growth in the psyche , that easily spreads by contagion to a group of psyches , and forms a political party or philosophic sect . The germ of this political growth is not  | itself political but biological and moral : it is the seedling of the life of reason sprouting within the secret self , and spreading as it finds the psychic soil favourable and the surrounding climate clement and sunny . Sympathy is a great help in the early stages of such moral integrations ; but when the inner domination has become deep-rooted and firm , contrary blasts harden rather than bend it ; and zeal in the cause grows faster than does the good work itself . This occurs , however , only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secondary habit in the animal psyche , a not indispensable synthesis of functions each capable of asserting itself separately , and apt , in rough weather , to lose all contact with its neighbours . The political power exercised in the alleged service of reason is always exercised by persons , themselves fundamentally irrational , but attached in their studious meditations to some rational utopia , or to phrases become catch-words for special interests , but still suggesting the rational aspirations of some political philosopher . A rationalist party may thus arise and govern in its day , as rationalist sects arise in philosophy , probably in both cases animated by an irrational hatred of tradition in general , and of religion in particular . It is not the work of such parties that I wish to study under the name of the Rational Order of Society . Such an Order would liberate all human interests , especially those that being ideal and harmless do not materially trample on one another , and that even psychologically can often be pursued together , to the delight and enrichment of a rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and unimaginative morals , counting bread-rations but not moments of sport or laughter . The militant aspect of reason in politics is therefore accidental , as are aggression and enmity in the generative order . Fishes , for instance , may have no choice but to devour one another if they are to live at all , vegetable food being absent or insufficient in their medium ; and plants in the jungle may be by nature pure parasites on other plants , or may , by merely existing , rob them of their necessary space , moisture , or sunlight . This is not militancy , but only involuntary and inevitable rivalry . So the agents that diffuse the life of reason must remove , not from the world but from their own lives and chosen surroundings , all that would destroy or subvert their rational economy . This would involve a strict and " totalitarian " discipline within the rational circle , as within a monastery or  | school or army , but without the least ambition to make all nature , all animals , or all societies rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncompromising regimen has a natural and irrational nucleus ; and as this nucleus differs in different races , ages , or countries , so the rational development there would differ from an equally rational development on another foundation . As to peace between different rational regimens or civilisations , it would depend on the physical possibility of their coexistence . If there was room and sustenance for all , they should rationally agree to differ . If only one could subsist at a time , underlying physical forces or economic developments , perhaps without war but certainly without reason , would automatically decide the issue . In itself , indeed , reason is something internal to spirit : a faculty of seeing identity , affinity , contrast , or irrelevance between essences present together in direct intuition . Though purely speculative in itself , this faculty sheds continual and revealing light on events and on the whole history and composition of the world ; because the images and the calculations that reveal surrounding facts to an animal have essentially dialectical relations to one another ; and these relations become patent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distractedly following the lures , the threats , and the shocks of pressing events . Language in making recognisable sounds to mark similar accidents tends to cast a net of grammatical relations over the flux of experience , and superposes in this way a partially intelligible syntax on the natural order of genesis in the world . Mathematical science , which in itself is perfectly hypothetical and ideal , carries this application of reason to nature one step further , with brilliant practical and speculative results . These results prove the partial truth of what language and myth assume too sweepingly : that nature , though fundamentally contingent and irrational , falls readily into repetitions and analogies which render possible a rational description and appreciation of what happens in some spheres and in some directions . There can be shrewd divination even in psychology and politics , in business and in war ; but all is at best imaginative presumption , which can be justified only where the objects studied are so simple in structure that the human senses can distinguish and measure their elements and movements . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when prophets profess to see dialectical necessity in the complex and confused movements of civilisation  | they indulge in a forced distortion both of facts and of logic and morals . The eloquent composition of historical books must indeed be inspired by a Muse , because it treats dramatically the fortunes of some man or some nation or some art ; but the dark background of destiny still remains dominant and dictates the moral , unless the partisan author relies on eloquence to reverse the truth . It is not therefore in the scientific description of society or of government , or in universal history , that any rational order is to be expected , but only , at best , in the exercise of government when this is virtuously inspired and intelligently pursued . The choice of reason as a guide , instead of Will or of faith or of public approval , is itself a matter of vital endowment or character in the individual . It will mark the type of morality that he advocates or actually exemplifies . Reason is a standard that the barbarian heartily despises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , much less in the practice , of politics . Intelligence has been admired and sharpened in the pursuit of irrational ends ; it has seldom been allowed to criticise or to select the ends actually pursued . And this is no scandal or paradox . Distress and vitality in a man breed and employ reason as a method of concentrating natural powers in himself or discovering them in the world ; but an intense cultivation of reason sucks up and reorganises all mental vista 's into a speculative habit that transcends those animal and social interests which it was cultivated to serve . The chief field in which such a habit has borne rich political fruit is mechanics , where a mathematical formula posited to govern material processes is verified in them ; yet even here the traceable rational order presupposes brute facts and arbitrary variations in them which do not become rational or intelligible simply for being habitual . Motion and change are themselves utterly irrational ; and both the fact that they occur and the fact that they seem to obey certain laws are factors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . Reason can not rationally deny or condemn nature , or the life and Will that nature breeds ; and this for various reasons . First : Reason itself owes its existence as a chief characteristic of the spirit to the spontaneous fertility of those material and vital powers . Secondly : Even spirit manifests an emotional and poetic sensibility which is not rational . Thirdly : On its rational side spirit transcends all censorious judgments or combative Will , and thereby gives carte blanche to all logical possibilities , but without sanctioning the  | existence of any one of them in particular . In all its sufferings and joys spirit therefore moves in the order of generation and not in that of reason . Consonantly with this , when reason becomes by any chance or any discipline a dominant movement in the psyche it tends to deflate all animal and political interests , and to deflate the passionate or playful impulses of spirit itself . It makes for omniscience , equilibrium , and peace : in a word , for Nirvana . Observing or foreseeing this , the domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an instrument in his pursuits , heartily detests reason as an inspiration or a sanctuary . With this reminder that reason is properly a spiritual virtue , having its standards and rewards in itself , we may be prepared to find the rational arts that flourish in the world to be secluded , like mathematics , or festive , like music ; also to find little but confusion and tragic failure where reason attempts to clarify such a concrete and mundane subject as politics or even as philosophy . For the life of reason on earth is inevitably distracted . In the presence of the aesthetic qualities and logical relations between things which actually appear to the spirit , a man harnessed to affairs or intent on his own passions will not see those obvious qualities in their rational logical order , but will see rather their irrational comings and goings or will feel only the active impulses which , as signs , they arouse automatically in his body . In this he obeys , like any other animal , the generative order of nature and of economic arts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vain accident and psychic waste , like after-images or dreams ; and nothing counts except a man 's physical reaction to the physical presence of particular dynamic objects , such as public events , institutions , and persons ; compounds that figure as units on the scale of the human body , and that produce that excitement in. the psyche of which images and feelings are echoes or prophecies to the spirit . What wonder , in such circumstances , that the political man should ignore reason , or be utterly confused if he attempts to be rational ? Material complications and headlong events are calling to him or threatening on every side . He must pick his perilous way among realities ; yet to conceive , remember , or forecast those realities he has only those " inert ideas " which past contacts have imposed on his uncertain and crowded memory ; and on this he must model his probably fatuous expectations . His automatic reactions will carry him forward before he knows what reasons he will assign p 300 for them if challenged in debate ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent his vague motives and , by mere repetition and emphasis , to vent his perhaps genuine emotions . If in a quandary he ever feels his terrible ignorance he can look for enlightenment only in the dead dramas congealed in books or in moral or religious precepts . There is indeed a fund of wisdom buried there , to which mankind may appeal when their living Will falters ; but like proverbs such maxims , especially in politics and religion , are contradictory , local , and casual . You must first know your aim , before you can choose a precept by which to justify it . RELATIVITY OF KNOWLEDGE AND OF MORALS MISTAKES and failure of reason occur continually in the exercise of government , and are sometimes recognised afterwards by those who made them . The mistakes made in the programmes and theories of political parties are often pointed out by their opponents , but seldom acknowledged by the parties themselves , because the sources of their views are fixed and the tests to which those views are subjected in practice are never adequate or final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or action . I assume that grounds exist , in the Will of certain men or in their education , for the choice that each party makes of its policy ; these grounds can not be rational fundamentally , but they may be consistent in their chosen aims ; and irrationality in argument or in action will then appear only if the circumstances are ignored which , at that time and place , may render the execution of that policy impossible . Then any irrational attempt to carry out that policy would be due to ignorance . If we agree to this , we shall be confirming the doctrine of Socrates that it is knowledge , not accidental desires or opinions , that makes conduct rational and right . What Socrates seems to have forgotten to say is that the knowledge requisite to make action rational in this sense lies entirely beyond the reach of mankind . We might be rational in trifles ? in taking a bus marked for the place to which we wish to go ? but never rational in choosing our political party and never , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our supporters must vote for . These major matters would all have to be decided by habit , accidental impressions , or mysterious intuition . Modern speculation , on the other hand , being introverted , places virtue in sentiment and intention rather than in art , and seeks to found morals on " the moral sense " or conscience , so that morality , private or public , would be entirely a matter of direct intuition and absolute or " categorical " in its spontaneous precepts . I should think , however , that at least in politics , the first commandment of the conscience in a responsible statesman would be to understand the world in which he was playing a part , and the capacities and genuine needs of the people in whose interest he was acting . So that his moral sense , if it was not a mere prejudice , would bring him back again into the hopeless position of Socrates , demanding before he could act rightly , a knowledge that he could never possess . Socrates , however , was providentially inspired as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fortunes of ancient Greece . The age of political and plastic arts was over , and that of private moral reflection and conversion had begun . His imagination , if we may trust the Utopia that Plato puts into his mouth , was archaically political ; and Plato 's own testament in the Laws was like the visions of the Hebrew Prophets , a transformation of a militant national past into an entrenched religious discipline , like that of the monasteries of the future . He meant to immortalise Sparta and Olympia , but he unwittingly legislated for Mount Athos and Monte Cassino . What I have called the forgetfulness of Socrates , in proposing an unattainable criterion for the conduct of life , was precisely what made him the herald of two thousand years of subjectivity and political and scientific disorder ; not that there ensued any dark ages or mediaeval barbarism for the spirit ; but on the contrary that a long and voluntary flight of the spirit into the wilderness was to develop its dramatic sense of isolation and its fonction fabulatrice , not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world in romantic and moralistic terms . Has not the time come for mankind to awake to its actual situation , and to that of the spirit that animates it ? The Sophists , who were in one sense the partners of Socrates , inasmuch as they too represented the dissolution of the classic world , pointed in an opposite direction in that the corruption of  | the traditional ethos seemed to them an emancipation instead of a divine summons to repentance and to an inner discipline of the soul . They abounded in miscellaneous information , as do the intellectuals of our own age , and being more bold and free than any modern can be , they doted on the relativity of knowledge and of morals , as they understood this relativity : namely , that morals and science , goodness and truth , could never be anything but the feeling or thought that each man had of them at each moment ; these thoughts and feelings were assumed , whenever a Sophist lectured to a company of town wits , to be indefinitely numerous and all different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of relativity might easily be expressed absolutely , by saying that all feelings of right and wrong , and all opinions were false : or in the language of Indian philosophy , were all illusions . But the Indians really meant this , and believed that only Brahman , or Spirit , was ever real . The Sophists , like the British empiricists , who have rediscovered this axiom , are essentially social beings , publicists , orators , teachers , and politicians . To them , the axiom that life is a dream , and all objects illusions , is taboo ; you must never mention it , because it would prick the bubble of your analytic reform of philosophy . Now when I say that morals and knowledge ( not the truth , but opinions regarding the truth ) and all judgments about right and wrong ( not all goods ) are relative I mean something entirely different . I mean that opinions and judgments arise in psyches and express the capacity and inevitableness of such opinions and judgments arising at each moment in each psyche ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their several deliverances have to the facts that provoke them and that they mean to refer to . That they refer to something which , existentially , they do not contain is due to the fact that they are not purely logical or psychological phenomena , - but spiritual transcripts of biological processes and tensions which are all self-transcendent , as are all the phases of existence . Spirit arises in animals when they react , as organisms charged with specific reflexes and potentialities of growth , which specific occasions excite and turn into action ; and as these reactions are directed upon the real objects that provoke them , so the spiritual transcript of them also is turned , in expectation , description , and appreciation upon the power that has evoked it . It is in view of this biological status of perception , opinion , and moral judgment that these spiritual events are necessarily rele-  | vant to their occasion and relative to the character of the organ that produces them under that stimulus . The degree of truth in ideas and beliefs , and the degree of justness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we can be aware of only by their effects , but on the character of the impression we receive and the complex reaction and radiation of that impression within the life of the psyche . Nothing could therefore be more false , and willfully ignorant , than to maintain with the Greek Sophists and the British empiricists ( when both are radical and consistent ) that knowledge and judgment refer to nothing and are always equally true and valid , in the sense that each is equally real ? as a sensation when it is felt . Their relativity , properly understood , far from making opinions and judgments worthless renders them capable of some'degree of truth and justness , since they express the sensibility of a living psyche , according to its endowment and development , to the influences that reach it , and determine its fate , in the natural world . The subjectivity of the Sophists and empiricists survives in German philosophy with an interesting difference . As the Sophists were publicists , and inconsistently posited a social but not physical world , and the empiricists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , so the German idealists posited a Philosophy of History or a Phenomenology of Spirit . This they drew from the Bible and from Saint Augustine as to history , and from their own inspiration for the Romance of Spirit . There is more air and light in all this than in the other subjective schools ; but I think we may say of all without exception that it is precisely when they are false to their subjective axioms , and feed on common sense , on real history , and on natural science , or even on theology , that they tell us anything worth hearing . MASKS OF VICE AND VIRTUE SOMETIMES an unexpected awakening quickens a dark corner of our nature and for a moment renders attractive , as in a dream , something that would normally seem repulsive . To bask in such a light  | might dislocate the balance of the psyche already achieved and might gradually poison all our habits and tastes . We should then acquire the mask of that vice in the public eye , and not merely , as perhaps we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really no less legitimate for seeming at first exotic . In this way the young of wild animals , that look so simple and innocent at birth , acquire the mask of ferocity or watchfulness or greed ? a mask that bears witness to habits they have learned to adopt . How or why have they acquired these habits ? Because they had organs capable of such employment , with suitable innate reflexes , often guided and stimulated by the example of their parents . Each tentative act so prepared has cast a ray of sunshine on a special image and has withdrawn attention from any others , now become meaningless sensations . The keen eye waits for the chosen signals , the paw gathers itself tightly for the sudden blow . The young animal , that seemed so plastic , has discovered his predestined path , without knowing where it will lead him . Lures and feats have been set for him , under the guise of goods ; and whatever evils they may entail , goods , supreme goods , exclusive goods they will now appear to his captivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The habits which he has acquired as virtues have stamped upon him what seems to us a horrible mask of vice . Not only is his strength utterly cruel and blind to all alien goods , but the vital liberty which that strength seems to serve is a tragic liberty even for him . He is condemned to turn , enslaved and tormented , in an irrational treadmill . It is important to perceive , for our instruction , that this mask of vice , which makes us shudder , expresses virtue and concentration of Will upon a recognised good . The animal psyche that as it developed its powers in contact with circumstances unwittingly fashioned that mask was bent upon a predatory life . It saw its victims , as it devoted its attention to its young or to its mate , as objects of immediate categorical value , goods to chase and devour or acts to perform and repeat at all costs . That the first set of these actions were wicked and the second set virtuous does not hold for that psyche ; both actions are expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally virtuous within the compass of that life . For life itself , the Will of the psyche and of its operation , is not a good , but only the fountain and organ of both good and evil , and the seat of their contrary character . Good and evil , in a dumb  | unquestioned immediacy , exist for the beasts . They are moral creatures vitally , though not intellectually ; and their vital virtue creates a genuine moral criterion for their lives , which we can appreciate in their strength , ingenuity , courage , and beauty . Yet those virtues , divorced from transcendent reason and justice , seem vices to- us . In themselves , however , they remain virtues even in us ; only that for us , who are inwardly called to be just , reasonable , and intelligent , those virtues are subordinated or forbidden ; and when we see them dominant in the bold mask worn by a beast , that mask seems to us hideous , because it would be morally hideous in a man . Even in the beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species to which it belongs has not attained a happy harmony in its constitution , but is overloaded and embarrassed by its own organs . Yet usually what repels us in natural monsters is not their own constitutional trouble but only the malice and ferocity that their aspects suggest in preying on other creatures . That death should feed on life and life on the death of other life is a first law of existence as we find it on earth ; and we accept and admire such alternation easily enough in the inanimate sphere ; yet it saddens us when we read into it an irrational hostility of one living psyche to another . This is a human error . Psyches , or forms of life , bear no hatred or ill-will towards other psyches ; they simply have no imagination , until they develop a highly social and cooperative way of living . Even then sympathy is very partial in any living creature ; for cooperation can not safely extend beyond those natural processes with which one 's own life is allied ; and sympathy without cooperation is merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their natural masks are masks of virtue , as we readily feel in regard to the mineral and vegetable kingdoms . Stars and flowers differ from one another in glory , and it is no vice or failure in any one not to show the glory of all . But animals possessing initiative necessarily have an optative or militant side . They have , and feel that they have , a standard of achievement and right behaviour ; and whatever falls short of this or contravenes it excites their contempt or hatred . Their possessive ethos makes them blind to- the virtue of contrary vocations . This intolerance survives in man in so far as he is more vital than rational . Fine art might seem to be a sphere in which alien gifts . or standards would surely be respected ; but not at all . The mask
