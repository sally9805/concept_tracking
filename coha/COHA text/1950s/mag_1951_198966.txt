ARGENTINA <P> Thinner and paler than ever after a month 's illness , Evita Pern came back last week to perhaps her greatest triumph . The occasion was the Peronistas ' Loyalty Day , celebrating the day in 1945 when Juan Pern was sprung from prison and swept back into power on the shoulders of his " shirtless " supporters . This year the day was dedicated to Evita . <P> Some 100,000 descamisados massed before the palace to pay tribute to " our lady of hope . " There was a thunderous roar as she was carried in an armchair , a slight figure in a checked burgundy suit , to Pern 's side on the balcony . Just before he spoke , the President decorated her with a special medal for relinquishing the vice-presidential nomination . Then , for the first time that anyone could remember , he clasped his wife in a public embrace . The descamisados howled with pleasure . <P> His wife , said Pern , is " not only the standard bearer of our movement but its soul and guiding spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply in a low-pitched voice . She thanked Pern " for having taught me to know you and love you . " She had left her bed to come , she said , because of her debt of gratitude " to Pern and to you , the workers-I do not care whether I have to part with pieces of my life to pay it . " For two minutes the crowd chanted : " Our lives for Pern . " <P> Then the President , following his six-year custom , proclaimed that the next day would be a holiday . It would be called " St. Evita Day . " <P> Pern , who still might be in trouble with the army , was undoubtedly in need of all the popular election support his ailing wife could win him . She had made her dramatic appearance in defiance of doctors ' orders . The official press had already announced that she would soon submit to an operation-the first hint that she was suffering from more than anemia . At week 's end it was reported that one of Evita 's doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would perform the operation .
