When it comes to General Curtis Emerson LeMay , the able , black-browed boss of the Air Force 's Strategic Air Command , official Washington and official Moscow have one thing in common : they both regard him with considerable respect . <P> <P> Moscow knows that Curt LeMay can drop SAC 's bombs on target and on schedule ; Washington knows that he can drop his hard , soldierly opinions the same way . <P> Last week as LeMay testified under oath before a Senate Armed Services Sub committee , chaired by Missouri 's airwise Democrat Stuart Symington , the capitol rushed to man its security defenses . Symington 's committee submitted all of its questions to LeMay in advance . In advance , LeMay wrote out all his answers for the next day 's session . In all-night conferences , both questions and answers were reviewed at the Pentagon by an Air Force task force and by a high-ranking Navy security specialist . Of the 153 questions asked during two days ' hearings , LeMay answered 78 in secret session . Despite all this , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hower Administration had yet seen . The key answers : <P> Although SAC presumably could still win any war the Soviets might start , " we are not capable of winning it without this country receiving very serious damage . Five years ago we could have won the war without the country receiving comparatively serious damage . " <P> As of April 30. the U.S. had produced only 78 intercontinental jet-powered B-52 bombers , and SAC had been obliged to delay acceptance of 31 of these because they had a defective turbine in the electrical system , " for which we now have a solution . " <P> " If our estimate of Soviet production is accurate , " the Russians are producing Bears and Bisons. their two modern long-range bombers , " at a combined rate substantially higher " than U.S. production of B-525 , and " we believe they now have more Bisons and Bears in their inventory than we have B-525 . " <P> EBy 1958-60 " the Soviet air force will have substantially more Bisons and Bears than we will have B-525 ... I can only conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have . " <P> Special Dedication . Even before LeMay finished testifying , the Administration brought up its big bazooka . Defense Secretary Charles Wilson , to fire a challenging round . His " best information , " said Engine Charlie enigmatically at a news conference , was that the Russians are indeed producing more long-range bombers than the U.S. , but " in itself that is not a very high rate either for us or for them . " Speaking of Curt LeMay , he added : " A dedicated specialist usually gets pretty well sold on his particular part of the business . That is no criticism . . . but in my experience , if you added up the desires and the stated needs and ambi tions of all your specialists , you would have an impossible total on your hands . " <P> Bolstering Wilson 's point , another top-level Administration spokesman declared that to give LeMay everything he wants for SAC ( including a force of 1,800 B-525 in 1958 rather than the 500 now planned ) would require an immediate increase of $55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the spokesman half in admiration , " thinks only SAC . "
