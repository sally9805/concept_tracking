Into the nation 's auto showrooms this week rolled the Big Three 's lowest-priced cars for 1959 . The emphasis was on a wide choice of new engines and economy features to balance higher selling prices . The restyled Chevrolet led the way with a new six-cylinder engine that " gives up to 10% more mileage , " also offered eight other engines ranging up to 315 h.p . Plymouth offered four engines from 132 h.p. to 305 h.p. , had a new gas-saving carburetor and new rear-axle-gear ratio , which it said " contribute to 10% greater economy of operation . " Ford came out with four engines ranging from 145 h.p. to 300 h.p. , said its lowest-powered , six-cylinder model will get better than 20 miles per gal . <P> Studebaker-Packard last week showed the press its 175-in. - long economy Lark , which gets 22 to 30 miles per gal . Studebaker said the six-cylinder , 90-h.p. models will be priced " below $2,000 , " but there will be higher-priced models with an op-tional V8 , 180-h.p. engine . More than 25,000 orders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the ' 58 model year . <P> Ordering moved so briskly for American Motors ' Rambler ( 72,566 firm orders from dealers v. 35,607 at the same time in 1957 ) that President George Romney again boosted his sales predictions-from 252,000 to 300,000 . He advertised the 100-in. wheel base Rambler American for a factory list price of $1,835 . <P> Dealers reported that demand for other models was racing far ahead of last year . But buyers found that a little haggling still goes a long way . Dealers were shaving about $200 to $300 off suggested list prices of most cars , with or without trade-ins . When pressed , dealers commonly offered discounts of $500 to $700 on cars listing at $3,500 or more with extras . Only the Cadillac dealers refused to bargain , figured that their luxury market will run high and fast without discounts . <P> Dealers still had a tough time finding enough cars to sell . Local strikes idled General Motors workers . Most of Plymouth 's production was shut down . Among the Big Three , only Ford rolled in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce full speed for 60 to 90 days . But strikebound Chevy had produced only 14,800 of the ' 593 for its 7,500 dealers .
