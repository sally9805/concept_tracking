In their fight to cut foreign-aid appropriations . House Democrats put on a cloak that was tailor-made for their uncomfortable posture . As onetime champions of mutual assistance and onetime foes of isolationism , they could not use the well-worn cry- " Why pour good U.S. dollars down foreign ratholes ? ' ' - against the principle involved . <P> " I want to give them every cent they need , " cried Louisiana 's Representative Otto Passman , leader of the cut-foreign-aid forces . The Eisenhower Administration , said Passman &; Co. , already has about $9.5 billion in unspent foreign-aid funds appropriated in previous years-plenty to keep the program going . Democrats could therefore place themselves on the record at one and the same time for economy and for effective foreign aid . The argument worked : the House cut the mutual-assistance appropriation to $3,191,810,000 , about $810 million below the Administration 's request and $175 million less than the House 's own earlier authorization ( TIME . Aug. 26 ) . <P> Last week the Administration set out to prove to the Senate that the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big guns-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , retired Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Arthur Radford . new JCS Chairman Nathan Twining , and outgoing International Cooperation Administrator John B. Hollister . They spoke eloquently , but perhaps too generally of the urgent necessity for more foreign-aid money to protect the security of the free world . But they failed to dispel the statistical myth of the " surplus " $9.5 billion . <P> That had to be done in careful detail by a team of second-echelon ICA and Defense Department foreign-aid experts . Some of the " surplus " could be accounted for by the fact that Passman &; Co. had engaged in such statistical antics as counting a $667 million item not once but twice in arriving at their final figure . Most of the $9.5 billion has been firmly committed to the foreign-aid pipeline . Example : the U.S. has about $3.7 billion in unexpended but obligated funds for arms for its allies . But such items as tanks and planes require about two years between the time they are ordered and the time they are delivered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , represents a U.S. obligation and can not be casually tossed off as some sort of surplus . <P> What the pipeline explanation made clear is that cuts in appropriations this year will mean a serious slashing of actual aid to U.S. allies in 1959 and 1960 , no matter what is done by Congress next year . It also made the point that when ( and if ) the time comes to call a halt to foreign aid the pipeline will have to be plugged two or three years in advance of the proposed cutoff date . The experts ' explanation seemed to clear the Senate 's vision . At week 's end it seemed likely that the Appropriations Committee and the Senate itself would restore at least part of the House cuts .
