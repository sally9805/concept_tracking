RONAN Acting Mayor Impellitteril charged yesterday that a city inspection trip arranged by Jerry Finkelstein , chairman of the City Planning Commission , for the fourMayoralty candidates was nothing more than a political tour intended to promote the candidacy of Justice Ferdinand Pecora , DemocraticLiberal party nominee . The tour was to begin at 10 o'clock this morning at City Hall Plaza but last night the Citizens Budget Commission , which also was a sponsor , announced that it had been postponed . Robert W. Dowling , president of the Budget Commission , said that he and Mr. Finkelstein felt that the absence of any of the candidates " might be construed politically " and they wished to avoid any such " misunderstanding . " The trip had been suggested by Mr. Finkelstein as a means of acquainting the candidates with the importance of city planning . Renewing his charge that Mr. Finkelstein was " the back-door manager " for Justice Pecora , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city planning program since he had been closely connected with it for the ' last five years as President of the 1 City Council and Acting Mayor . " The trip might prove interesting and instructive for Judge Pecora , " he declared . Mr. Impellitteri 's observations were made yesterday as he made an automobile trip with officials of the New York City Housing // Authority through Manhattan , Queens and Brooklyn to inspect housing projects erected with the aid of public funds and the recently-opened James Ewing Hospital at First Avenue and Sixty-eighth Street . He said that he had planned this tour a long time ago and had had no advance knowledge of the planning trip . He also asserted that the members of the Board of Estimate and the other members of the planning commission , among them Park Commissioner Robert Moses , " who knows more about city planning than any man in the country , " had not known about it . During a stop at the James Weldon Johnson Houses at 1844 Lexington Avenue , Mr. Impellitteri reviewed the city 's housing program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed nearly half a million persons will be moved from the slums into decent housing . Declaring that the program had had his strong support during the last five years , Mr. Impellitteri said that he was " very proud " of it and would see that it continued with full speed . In a speech over station WJZ last night , Mrs. Betty Impellitteri , the candidate 's wife , told how he came home " one evening not so long ago " and told her that he had been offered a nomination to the Supreme Court if he would get out of the campaign for Mayor . " He said he had turned the offer dc.wn even though it would have meant security for both of us for the rest of our lives , " she continued . " He told me that he felt he deserved to be Mayor because of his experience in the job and that he had refused to withdraw . " He also said that his decision might write an end to his entire career in public life and he felt I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy that he told me so frankly just what his decision had been and I liked the sincere and forthright way in which he spoke , even though I have never known him to be anything but completely honest . " But I will tell you another thing that may at first surprise you . I was glad that he did not consult me before he gave his answer . I was glad because he had such faith in me that he knew he did n't have to ask me . He was certain all the time of just how I would feel  --  and he was right . " Mrs. Impellitteri said that she was never prouder of her husband than at that moment and that she told him he could have made no other decision . In another development , Walter T. Shirley , Mr. Impellitteri 's campaign chairman , renewed his plea for financial assistance from the people . He said that more than $10,000 in $1 and $5 bills had been contributed by citizens who desired to help Mr. Impellitteri " in his gallant campaign against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no alarming shortage of funds , Mr. Shirley said , additional funds were needed to meet financial obligations during the final days of the campaign . Alexander Weinstock , president of Local 370 of the Correction Officers , C. I. 0. , last night repudiated the use of his name in an advertisement in a civil service paper endorsing Justice Pecora . He said he was working for Mr. Impellitteri . Addressing 500 delegates of the Joint Board of Sanitation Locals , A. F. L. , in the Hans Jaeger Restaurant at Lexington Avenue and Eighty-fifth Street , the Acting Mayor said he had been informed Justice Pecora had gone to Washington but Mr. Impellitteri was skeptical whether Mr. Pecora would pick up any New York Mayoralty notes on his trip . He referred to a news report in an afternoon newspaper that said Cardinal Spellman had called on Justice Pecora . The Acting Mayor said the Cardinal had happened to be in the Commodore Hotel , where Justice Pecora has his political headquarters , to attend ... a function not connected with the political campaign and accidentally met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
