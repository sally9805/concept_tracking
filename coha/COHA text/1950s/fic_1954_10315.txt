He knew that the only person you can trust is an absolutelyselfish person . He always runs true to form . You know everything he 'll do . But you take somebody with an underlying kindness , and he might fool you . The only satisfactory sucker is the one who is entirely selfish . You never have any trouble with that kind .

Suzy you would n't forget . A real bad risk . Suzy liked people or she did n't like them . That in itself was bad . Cacahuete , the Patron 's nephew , was dusting shelves , and he flashed a gold smile at Suzy . Suzy lighted up . She did n't smile  --  she grinned . Her lips were full and her mouth wide , and when she grinned her eyes crinkled and something warm and scary came out of her . That 's a bad risk . On top of this was toughness , but not dependable dull toughness . Suzy might take a poke atp51Jack Dempsey . She was n't smart . All in all , Joseph and Mary would 've dumped Suzy in a minute . She 'd be the kind of dumb dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . She was the kind , he thought , who 'd give one guy a helluva lot of trouble but who 'd be lousy playing the field . She had something of the same quality Doc had . The Patron decided to warn Fauna again . This kid could be pure murder in a hookshop . Such was the Patron 's reasoned opinion , and the Patron was a professional . If you 'd take a doctor 's advice about a disease , you 'd surely take the Patron 's about a hustler . Both could be wrong , of course . The appraisals and judgments were almost instantaneous , so that by the time Suzy had opened her cigarettes , put one in her mouth , and lighted it , the judgment was complete . " How are you ?

Doc came in with two empty beer bottles . " Get ap52couple of cold ones back on the ice , will you ? " he asked . Suzy glanced at him , took him in , and looked away . His beard shocked her a little . She did n't stare at him the way you do n't stare at a cripple . The Patron said , " Why do n't you put in an icebox ? Then you can take a case at a time .

" The Patron was defending Doc the way everyone did . " Kind of hoity-toity ? " asked Suzy . " Hell no ! That 's the way he always talks . He do n't know no other way . " " Well , I guess it takes all kinds , " said Suzy . " He gets bugs and stuff out of the ocean and sells them . " " Who to ? " " Why , there 's people 'll buy anything , " said the Patron . " I guess so . Why do n't other people do it ? " " Too much work , and you got to know what to get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I used to know a wrestler wore one .

" The Patron went on , " In the Army they made a guy with a beard shave it off . Said a guy with a beard wanted to be different , and the best way to not get along in the barracks is to be different . " " Maybe that 's it , " said Suzy . " I do n't mind a different guy if he ai n't too different . " " Dames can take it , " said the Patron . " They do n't like it but they can take it . What the hell am I doing all this talking for ?

" Be seeing you , " said Suzy , and she went out and let the screen door slam . She ai n't a bad kid , the Patron thought , but I 'd sure kick her the hell out of the Bear Flag . Doc looked out the window of Western Biological . He watched Suzy walk past the vacant lot and up to the front porch of the Bear Flag . Just as she was about to climb the steps she turned and looked around . She thought someone was looking at her . She did n't see Doc. 54 Sweet Thursdayp54Pacific Grove and Monterey sit side by side on a hill borderingthe bay . The two towns touch shoulders but they are not alike . Whereas Monterey was founded a long time ago by foreigners , Indians and Spaniards and such , and the town grew up higgledy-piggledy without plan or purpose , Pacific Grove sprang full blown from the iron heart of a psycho-ideo-legal religion . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came fully equipped with laws , ideals , and customs . On the town 's statute books a deed is void if liquor is ever brought on the property.CAs a result , the sale of iron-and-wine tonic is fantastic Pacific Grove has a law that requires you to pull your shades down after sundown , and forbids you to pull them down before . Scorching on bicycles is forbidden , as is sea bathing and boating on Sundays . There is one crime which is not defined but which I , is definitely against the law . Hijinks are or is forbidden It must be admitted that most of these laws are not enforced to the hilt . The fence that once surrounded the Pacific Grove retreat is no longer in existence . Once , during its history , Pacific Grove was in trouble , deep trouble . You see , when the town was founded many old people moved to the retreat , people you 'd think did n't have anything to retreat from . These old people became grumpy after a while and got to interfering in everythingp55and causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two roque courts . Roque is a complicated kind of croquet , with narrow wickets and short-handled mallets . You play off the sidelines , like billiards . Very complicated , it is . They say it develops character . In a local sport there must be competition and a prize . In Pacific Grove a cup was given every year for the winning team on the roque courts . You would n't think a thing like that would work up much heat , particularly since most of the contestants were over seventy . But it did . One of the teams was called the Blues and the other the reens . The old men wore little skullcaps and striped blazers in their team colors . Well it was n't more than two years before &; hell broke loose . The Blues would practice in the court right alongsidethe Greens but they would n't speak to them . And thenit got into the families of the teams . You were a Blue family or a Green family . Finally the feeling spread outside the family . You were a partisan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so that the Greens tried to . discourage intermarriage with the Blues , and vice versa . Pretty soon it reached into politics , so that a Green would n't think of voting for a Blue . It split the church right down the middle . The Blues and the Greens would n't sit on the same side . They made plans to build separate churches . Of course everything got really hot at tournament time . Things were very touchy . Those old men brought a passionto the game you would n't believe . Why , two octogenarianswould walk away into the woods and you 'd find.  |p56them  locked in mortal combat . They even developed secret languages so that each would n't know what the other was talking about . Well , things got so hot and feeling ran so high that the county had to take notice of it . A. Blue got his house burned down and then a Green was found clubbed to death with a roque mallet in the woods . A roque mallet is short-handled and heavy and can be a very deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to their wrists by thongs , like battle-axes . They did n't go any place without them . There was n't any crime each did n't charge the other with , including things they 'd outgrown and could n't have done if they 'd wanted to . The Blues would n't trade in Green stores . The whole town was a mess . The original benefactor , Mr. Deems , was a nice old fellow . He used to smoke a little opium , when it was legal , and this kept him healthy and rested so that he did n't get high blood pressure or tuberculosis . He was a benevolent , ' man , but he was also a philosopher . When he saw what he had created by giving the roque courts to the Pacific Grove retreat he was saddened and later horrified . He said he knew how God felt . The tournament came July 30 , and feeling was so bad that people were carving pistols . liieeeids and Green kids had gang wars : Mr .. Deems , after a period of years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might as well act like God . There was too much violence in town. - On the night of July 29 Mr. Deems sent out a bulldozer . In the morning , where the roque courts had been , there was only a deep , ragged hole in the ground . If he 'd hadp57time he would have continued God 's solution . He 'd have filled the hole with water . They ran Mr. Deems out of Pacific Grove . They would have tarred and feathered him if they could have caught him , but he was safe in Monterey , cooking his yen shi over a peanut-oil lamp . Every July 30 , to this day , the whole town of Pacific Grove gets together and burns Mr. Deems in effigy . They make a celebration of it , dress up a life-size figure , and hang it from a pine tree . Later they burn it . People march underneathwith torches , and the poor helpless figure of Mr. Deems goes up in smoke every year. here are people who will say that this whole account is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie even if it did n't necessarily happen . To a casual observer Cannery Row might have seemed a series of self-contained and selfish units , each functioning alone with no reference to the others . There was little visible connection between La Ida 's , the Bear Flag , the grocery ( still known as Lee Chong 's Heavenly Flower Grocery ) , the Palace Flophouse , and Western Biological Laboratories . The fact is that each was bound by gossamerp58threads of steel to all the others  --  hurt one , and you aroused vengeance in all . Let sadness come to one , and all wept . Doc was more than first citizen of Cannery Row . He was healer of the wounded soul and the cut finger . Strongly entrenched in legality though he was , he found himself constantly edged into infringements by the needs of his friends , and anyone could hustle him for a buck without half trying . When trouble came to Doc it was everybody 's trouble . What was Doe 's trouble ? Even he did n't know . He was deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his desk with a yellow pad before him and his needle-sharp pencils lined up . Sometimes his wastebasket was full of crushed , scribbled pages , and at others not even a doodle went down . Then he would move to the aquarium and stare into it . And his voices howled and cried and moaned . " Write ! " said his top voice , and " Search ! " sang his middle voice , and his lowest voice sighed , " Lonesome ! Lonesome ! " He did not go down without a struggle . He resurrectedold love affairs , he swam deep in music , he read the Sorrows of Werther ; but the voices would not leave him . The beckoning yellow pages became his enemies . One by one the octopi died in the aquarium . He had worn thin the excuse of his lack of a proper microscope . When the last octopus died he leaped on this as his excuse . When his friends visited him he would explain , " You see , I ca n't go on without specimens , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as I have specimens and a new microscopeI can whip the paper right off . " His friends sensed his pain and caught it and carried itp59away with them . They knew the time was coming when they would have to do something . In the Palace Flophouse a little meeting occurred  --  occurred , because no one called it , no one planned it , and yet everyone knew what it was about . Wide Ida brooded hugely . The Bear Flag was representedby Agnes , Mabel , and Becky . All the boys were accounted for . The meeting began casually and obliquely , as all meetings should . Hazel said , " Wide Ida throwed out a drunk last night and sprained her shoulder . " " I ai n't as young as I used to be , " Wide Ida said gloomily . " The drunk dared her , " said Hazel . " He did n't even touch the sidewalk going out . If they was an Olympic event for A and C , Wide Ida would win it easy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They kept skirting their problem . Mack said , " How 's Fauna been ? " " Pretty good . She got problems , " said Agnes . Becky was delicately picking off nail polish . " That Fauna , " she said , " she 's a wonder . She 's giving us tablesettinglessons . I bet if they was thirty-five forks , she 'd know what every one of them was for . " " Ai n't they to eat with ? " Hazel asked . " Jesus , what a ignorant ! " said Becky . " I bet you do n't know a dessert fork from a hole in the ground . " Hazel said belligerently , " You know what a Jackson fork is for ? " " No , what ? " " Just leave it lay and see who 's a ignorant , " said Hazel.  |p60Wide  Ida asked , " Any change with Doc ? " " No , " said Mack . " I went over to see him last night . I wisht there was something we could do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Doc , they were equally hard on his friends who loved him . Once he had been infallible . There was nothing he could not do because there was nothing he wanted to do very much . And in spite of themselves a little contempt for him was growingin his friends  --  a kind and loving contempt that might never have happened if he had not once been so great . People who had once spoken his name with awe now felt better than he because he was no better than they . " I ai n't got an idea 's how to proceed , " said Mack . Hazel said , " How 's about if we ask Fauna to do his horoscope ? She 's doing me right now . " " You ai n't got no future , " said Mack . " I have too , " said Hazel . " I bet Fauna could tell us what to do about Doc . " Mack looked interested . " It 's better than nothing , " he said . " Hoc sunt . Eddie , you dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hazel , you ask Fauna to come over for a drink . Tell her to bring her star stuff . " " Maybe she 's got me finished , " said Hazel . It was a matter of some sorrow to Fauna that she did n't entirely believe in astrology , but she had found that nearly everyone wants to believe that the stars take notice of us . Her science gave her a means for telling people what they ought to do , and Fauna had definite ideas about what everybody ought to do . In spite of her secret skepticism , every once in a while she turned up a reading that astonished her . Hazel 's horo/scope had her breathless and baffled . She seriously consideredburning it and never telling him . Hazel led her to the Palace Flophouse and Mack poured her a drink from the keg . She tossed it off , still deep in thought . " You got my stars wrote down ? " Hazel demanded anxiously . Fauna regarded him sorrowfully . " I do n't want to tell you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Awful , " said Fauna . " Come on , tell me . I can take it . " Fauna sighed . " I 've checked it over and over , " she said . " You sure you give me your true birthday ? " " Sure . " " Then I do n't see how it can be wrong . " She turned wearily and faced the others . " The stars say Hazel 's going to be President of the United States . " There was a shocked silence . " I do n't believe it , " siad Mack . " I do n't want to be President , " Hazel said , and he did n't . " There is no choice , " said Fauna . " The stars have spoke . You will go to Washington . " " I do n't want to ! " Hazel cried . " I do n't know nobody there . " " I wonder where we could all go , " said Whitey No. 2 . " I seen some islands in the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them too . The U. S. got a man-date . " " I wo n't take it , " said Hazel . Mack said , " We could kill him . "  | " His stars do n't say it , " Fauna said . " He 's going to live to seventy-eight and die from a spoiled oyster . " " I do n't like oysters , " said Hazel . " Maybe you 'll learn in Washington . " Mack said , " Maybe you made a mistake . " " That 's what I hoped , " said Fauna . " I went over and over it . No , sir ! Hazel is going to be President . " " Well , we 've weathered some pretty bad ones , " Eddie offered forlornly . " Ai n't they no way I can tell them I wo n't do it ? Hell , I 'll hide out ! " said Hazel desperately . Fauna shook her head dismally . " I 'll check again , " she said , " but I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , count . " Hazel took off his shoes and moved his lips . " Nine , " he said bitterly . " That 's what the horoscope said . We can only pray it 's for the best . " " Lord ! " said Whitey No. 2 . " That 's what I call a nineto-oneprayer . Fauna , now you 've went and made a presidentout of a sow 's ear , how about getting Doc 's paper wrote ? " " Who 's a sow 's ear ? " Hazel demanded . " William Henry Harrison . " " Oh ! " said Hazel . " Oh yeah ! " Agnes piped up in her hoarse soprano , " Doc just ai n't himself . I took him a pint and he did n't hardly pass the time a day . Just set there looking at that yellow paper . Know what was on that paper ? " 63 " Eggs , " said Whitey No . I. " No . I do n't like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn ! " said Mack . " Maybe he 's getting well . Go on  --  what ? " " Well , " said Agnes in a shocked voice , " he 'd drew a picture of a lady without no clothes on , and right beside that was one of them damn devilfish , only it was smoking a pipe . Do n't hardly seem like the old Doc . " Wide Ida shook herself out of a mountainous lethargy . " He used to be the easygoinest guy in the world . Now he 's got a wild hair . Anybody else but Doc , I 'd figure it was a dame . But hell ! Doc can take dames or let them alone . " Mack said , " He could even take dames and let them alone . " Fauna put her hands on her hips . " You fellas sure there ai n't a girl hiding out where he ca n't get to her ? " " No , " said Hazel . " I wisht he 'd snap out of it . Go over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he do n't listen . " " Let 's run a few dames past him and see if he picks up , " said Whitey No. 2 . Mack said , " I do n't believe in it but I wish Fauna would do a job on Doc . Might give us an idea . " Fauna said , " I never seen nobody that wanted me to do a horoscope that believed in it . I ai n't sure I believe in it myself . Sure I 'll do Doc . When 's his birthday ? " With surprise they realized that no one could remember . " Seems like it was in autumn , " said Eddie . " Got to have it , " Fauna said . " Mack , you think you could find out ? "  | " I guess so . Say , Fauna , if you ai n't got too much integrity , could you maybe rig it a little ? " " How do you mean ? " " Well , kind of tell him to lay off his goddam paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with his paper if only he gets it wrote ? " Hazel demanded . Mack scratched his stomach . " I guess we got to face it , " he said . " Doc wants to write that crazy paper . Driving himself nuts with it . Know what I think ? Doc ai n't never going to write that paper . " Hazel stood up . " What d' you mean ? " " Well , you know them kind of people they call accident prone ? No matter what they do they get hurt . It 's like they want accidents . Well , I think Doc do n't really want to write that paper . " Whitey No. i said , " He sure goes about it the hard way . " " Ever hear of a substitute ? " said Mack . " You mean like on the bench at football ? " Eddie asked . " Hell no ! " said Mack . " I mean like a guy is using something to cover up something else  --  and maybe he do n't even know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ? " " Take it easy , " said Mack . " I think Doc 's scared to write that paper because he knows it 's crazy . Quod erat demon-strandum . " " Huh ? " asked Fauna . " Q.E.D. , " said Mack . " Oh ! " said Fauna . " Sure . "  |p65Doc  had made changes . His desk was drawn in front  --  of the window . He sat writing rapidly on his yellow pad . " Color change , " he wrote , " seems to be not only a concentration of fluids to the surface but also a warping of tissue , which , perhaps , refracts the light , giving an impression of color . " A door slammed . Doc looked out at the street . Fauna was teetering down the chicken walk that led from the Palace Flophouse . Doc looked back at his pad . There were footsteps on the pavement . He looked up . Wide Ida was going toward her bar . Joseph and Mary came out of the Heavenly Flower and crossed the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come in , " Doc cried , and there was relief in his voice . " Thought I 'd shovel the dirt a little . That band of mine is practicing upstairs . Drives me crazy . " " Well , I 'm pretty busy , " said Doc . J and M gazed about the room . " Why do you keep snakes ? " " To sell . " " Who 'd buy snakes ? " said J and M. " Say , what you looking at ? " He craned his neck . " That 's the new dame.  |p66She  's going to give Fauna trouble . Little Mary trouble . " " Who ? " Doc asked . " You was n't listening , I guess . " " I must get to work , " said Doc . " You know , I still do n't get it . " " What ? " " There must be some way to kind of bend the odds in chess . " " There is n't . I 've got to go . " " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doc walked on the beach beyond the lighthouse . The waves splashed white beside him and sometimes basted his ankles . The sandpipers ran ahead of him as though on little wheels . The golden afternoon moved on toward China , and on the horizon 's edge a lumber schooner balanced . On Doc 's left the white sand dunes rounded up , and behind them the dark pine trees seemed to hold a piece of night throughout the day . Doc thought , Under stimulation there is increased pulsinglike a man under physical or emotional strain , something like the release of adrenalin  --  but no way to prove it . No more specimens until the spring tides . His middle voice argued , " Maybe you do n't believe any of it . Why ca n't you laugh at yourself ? You could once . You 're trapped in a cage of self-importance . " " Lonesome ! " the low voice cried in his guts . " No one to receive from you or give to you . No one warm enough and dear enough . " Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep67hopeless wish of a man wanting to be a little boy , forgetting the pain of little boys . Doc dropped to his knees and dug a hole in the damp sand with a scooped hand . He watched the sea water seep in and crumble the sides of the hole . A sand crab scuttled away from his digging fingers . From behind him a voice said , " What are you digging for ? " " Nothing , " said Doc without looking around . " There are no clams here . " " I know it , " said Doc . And his top voice sang , " I just want to be alone . I do n't want to talk or explain or argue or even to listen . Now he 'll tell me a theory he 's got on oceanography . I wo n't look around .

" It 's just my business but you tell me about it . " He did n't remember ever having been discourteous to a stranger before . This one was a big , bearded stranger with the lively , innocent eyes of a healthy baby . He wore ragged overalls and a blue shirt washed nearly white , and he was barefooted . The straw hat on his head had two large holes cut in the brim , proof that it had once been the property of a horse . Doc found his interest rising . " It is my custom to invite a stranger to dinner , " said thep68seer . " Not original , of course . Harun al-Rashid did the same . Please follow me . " Doc stood up from his squatting position . The tendons in back of his knees creaked with pain . The seer towered above him , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merry light of a wise baby . But his face was granitic  --  chiseled out of the material of prophets and patriarchs . Doc found himself wondering if some of the saints had not looked like this . From the ragged sleeves of the blue shirt wrists like big grapevines protruded , and hands sheathed in brown calluses crisscrossed with barnacle cuts . The seer carried a pair of ancient basketball shoes in his left hand , and , seeing Doc look at them , he said , " I only wear them in the sea . My feet are n't proof against urchins and barnacles . " In spite of himself Doc felt surrounded by the man . " Harun , " said Doc , " was visited by djinni and the spirits of earth , fire , and water . Do the djinni visit you ? " Doc thought , Oh Lord ! Am I going to play along with this nonsense ? Why ca n't 1 cross my fingers and spit and walk away ? I can still walk away . The seer looked downward at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said simply . " I live in the open . I hear the waves at night and see the black patterns of the pine boughs against the sky . With sound and silence and color and solitude , of course I see visions . Anyone would . " " But you do n't believe in them ? " Doc asked hopefully . " I do n't find it a matter for belief or disbelief , " the seer said . " You 've seen the sun flatten and take strange shapes just before it sinks in the ocean . Do you have to tell your. - p69self every time that it 's an illusion caused by atmospheric dust and light distorted by the sea , or do you simply enjoy the beauty of it ? Do n't you see visions ? " " No , " said Doc . " From music , do n't forms of wishes and forms of memorytake shape ? " " That 's different , " said Doc . " I do n't see any difference , " said the seer . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are deep little creases where the windcrouchingpines have made a stand against the moving sand , and in one of these , only a hundred yards back from the beach , the seer had his home . The little valley was protected from the wind . The pine boughs covered it , and the sand was deeply carpeted with sweet pine needles . Once down in the little cup you could hear the wind sweeping the pine tips overhead , and a perpetual dusk hung under the warped trees . The pines survived only by following the suggestions of the stronger forces  --  crouching low and growing their limbs in the direction of the wind , nourishingthe little trailing plants which slow up the pace of the walking dunes . Under the trees a fire was burning , and on a hearth of flat stones blackened tin cans steamed . " This is my home , " the seer said . " You are welcome here . I have a wonderful dinner .

Some people think it 's aphrodisiac . " There was an iron simplicity in the seer . He was like a monolith of logic standing against waves of angry nonsense . " Next we 'll have steamed limpets , " said the seer . " I have a pin here to eat them with . Do you like sea lettuce ? It 's an acquired taste . And then I have a stew  --  a kind of universal bouillabaisse  --  I wo n't tell you what 's in it . You 'll see . " Do you take all of your food from the sea ? " The seer smiled at him . " No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler . I take all the protein I need , and more , but my human stomach still craves starch . I want a littlebread and some potatoes . I love acid with the protein .

" You wo n't find sugars in a tide pool . " The seer dropped his eyes and watched a black ant try to climb an avalanche of sand , losing ground all the way . When he spoke his voice was shy and ashamed . " I steal candy bars , " he said . " I ca n't seem to help it . " " The flesh is weak , " said Doc . " Oh , I do n't mind that , " the seer cried . " Appetites are good things .

" They picked the limpets from their shells with pins and dipped them in lemon juice . The stew contained mussels and clams and crabs and little fish , seasoned with garlic and rosemary . " Some people do n't like it , " said the seer . After they had finished Doc lay back in the pine needles , and a fine peacefulness settled on him . The air , the softness of the needles , the odors of kelp and pine and yerba buena , the music of surf against wind-plucking pine needles , the fullness of belly , made a little room of contentment around him .

" " I forgot , " said Doc . " You are crazy , are n't you ? " " I guess so , " said the seer , " but not dangerous . And they 've never caught me stealing candy bars . I 'm very clever at that , and I steal only one at a time . " " Do n't ever gather disciples , " said Doc . " They 'd have you on a cross in no time . "  | " There 's not much danger of that .

Can you drink it out of a beer bottle ? " " 1 do n't know why not . " " Look out ! The bottle 's hot ! Here , wrap a twig around it . After a while the seer asked , " What 's aching you , or do n't you want to talk about it ? " " I 'd just as soon talk about it if I knew what it was , " said Doc . " As a matter of fact , it 's gone away for the moment . " " Ah , one of those , " said the seer . " Do you have wife or children ? " " No . " " Do you want wife or children ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I saw a mermaid last night . You remember , there was a half moon and a thin drifting mist . There was color in the night , not like the black and gray and white of an ordinary night . Down at the end of the beach a shelf of rock reaches out , and the tide was low so that there was a smooth bed of kelp . She swam to the edge and then churned her tail , like a salmon leaping a rapid . Andp73then she lay on the kelp bed and made dancing figures with her white arms and hands . She did n't go away until the rising tide covered the kelp bed . " " Was she a dream ? Did you imagine her ? " " I do n't know . But if I did I 'm proud that I could imagine anything so beautiful . What is it you want ? " " I 've tried to think , " said Doc . " I want to take everything I 've seen and thought and learned and reduce them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , something of use . And I ca n't seem to do it . " " Maybe you are n't ready . And maybe you need help . " " What kind of help ? " " There are some things a man ca n't do alone . I would n't think of trying anything so big without  --  " He stopped . The heavy waves beat the hard beach , and the yellow light of the setting sun illuminated a cloud to the eastward , a clot of gold . " Without what ? " Doc asked . " Without love , " said the seer . " I have to go to the sunset now . I 've come to the point where I do n't think it can go down without me . That makes me seem needed .

Things came through slowly to Hazel . He had heard Mack advancehis theory about how Doc would never get his paper written , but the impact of the statement did not strike home until he was alone . It is true that all over Cannery Row the feeling was growing that Doc was not infallible , but the news had not seeped through to Hazel . He knew that Doc was in trouble , but the friendly feeling of contempt had not penetrated . If Hazel had wanted to know the day and hour of the world 's demise , he would have gone to Doc and Doc 's answer would have been final . Alone he brooded , not about Doc 's weakness , but about the treachery of Doc 's friends who could question him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the arm of his rocking chair for a while and then he got up and went to Wide Ida 's . Eddie was behind the bar , so Hazel had two shots of whisky and paid for a Coke . He walked between two canneries to the beach . A seagullwith a broken wing engaged his kindly interest . He chased it , trying to help it , until it swam to sea and drowned . Hazel had experienced an earthquake and he searchedp75for the shaker . He walked along the rocks to Pacific Grove Beach , and even the brown young men standing on their hands for the girls did not hold interest . He went up the hill and toured the basement of Holman 's Department Store . The floor manager accompanied him , an honor and a precaution few people received . But Hazel did n't even see the shining display of small tools . You can not cut the ground from under a man and expect him to act normally . On his way back to Cannery Row , Hazel passed a funeral home where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of celebration with enthusiasm . But now he watched the mounds of gladiolas being carried out and no sense of participation stirred in him . The festive dead would have to be buried without Hazel . In New Monterey , Hazel walked , not around , but right through a dog fight . All the preceding manifestations would have troubled his friends , but if they had known what Hazel was thinking they would have been horrified . Thinking is always painful , but in Hazel it was heroic . A picture of the process would make you seasick . A gray , whirling furor of images , memories , words , patterns . It was like a traffic jam at a big intersection with Hazel in the middle trying to get something to move somewhere . He strolled back to Cannery Row but he did not go to the Palace Flophouse . By instinct , he crept under the branches of the black cypress tree in the vacant lot where he had lived for so many years in pre-Palace days . Hazel 's thoughts were not complicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hazel loved Doc . Doc was in trouble . Somebody wasp76responsible . Who ? That it might be a situation rather than a person was beyond his grasp . The person who was hurtingDoc must be made to stop it even if he had to be killed . Hazel had nothing against murder . That he had n't killed anybody was only because he had n't needed to or wanted to . He tried to recall everything he had heard concerning Doc 's frustration , and it was all nebulous , all vague , except for one thing : Mack had said Doc could n't write his paper . That was the only clear statement that had been made . Mack was the one . If Mack knew about it , he must be responsible for it . This was a matter of sorrow to Hazel , because he liked Mack very much . He hoped he would n't have to kill him . It was getting dark under the cypress tree , too dark to read . Hazel always judged light by whether or not you could read by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read anything . The front-porch light of the Bear Flag came on . Western Biological was still dark . Up the hill in the Palace Flophouse the kerosene lantern made a dim glow through the windows . Again and again , Hazel tried to turn to sweet thoughtlessness , but it was no use . Mack was responsible . Mack had to do something about it . Hazel got up and brushed the cypress dirt from his clothes . He walked up past the rusty pipes and the empty boiler , crossed the railroad track , and went up the chicken walk . Behind him , muffled by the canneries , he could hear Cacahuete playing " Stormy Weather " on his trumpet and the sea lions on China Point barking . In the Palace , Mack and the boys were playing ticktacktoewith a piece of chalk on the floor . The wining jug was . set conveniently near.  | " Hi , Hazel , " said Mack . " Draw up . " " Mack , " Hazel said sadly , " I want you should step outsidewith me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels . " What ! " " I 'm going to beat the holy hell out of you , " said Hazel . " Why ? " Mack asked . This was just the question Hazel was afraid of . He tried to find a quick , tough answer . " You just step out and you 'll find out , " he said . " Hazel  --  " Mack stood up . " Hazel baby , what 's eating you ? Tell me . See if I ca n't make it right . " Hazel felt the whole situation leaving his hands . " You ca n't treat Doc that way , " he said fiercely . " Not Doc ! " " What way am I treating him ? I ai n't done nothing to Doc , except maybe hustle him a little . But we all done that  --  even you tried . " " You said he ca n't write his paper , that 's what you done . " " Oh , for God 's sakes ! " said Mack . " You 're yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometime when I ai n't feeling yellowI 'll paddywhack you . Sit down . Have a jolt from the jug . " They babied Hazel and pampered him until his eyes were damp with appreciation . But when Hazel 's mind dug in it would not let loose . " You got to help him , " he repeated . " He ai n't happy , he just mopes . You got to help him . " Mack said , " It ai n't entirely our fault . Trouble is , Doc lets concealment like a worm in the bud feed on his damask cheek . " " He sure as hell does , " said Whitey No. z.  | " I ai n't going to stand for no excuses , " said Hazel . Mack studied the problem from every angle . " Hazel 's right , " he said at last . " We 've been selfish . We never in our lives had such a good friend as Doc , and we 're letting him down . Makes me feel ashamed . It 's Hazel showed the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel to do no figuring but I sure would like to have him for a friend . " Hazel ducked his head in embarrassment . In his life so few compliments had come his way that he did n't know how to cope with them . Mack went on , " I make a solemn move we all stand up and drink a toast to Hazel  --  a noble , noble soul ! " " Aw , hell , fellas , " said Hazel , and he wiped his eyes on his sleeve . They stood in a circle around him , Mack and Eddie , Whitey No. i and Whitey No. 2 , and each one tipped the jug over his elbow and drank to Hazel . Good feeling was running so high they did it again , and were about to do it a third time when Hazel said , " Ai n't there something we can drink to so I can get a drink ? " " To Lefty Grove ! " said Eddie . That broke the ice . An era of good feeling set in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had saved during the war . He started the bung and smelled it delicately. " 1 remember this one , " he said . " They was some guys up from South America and they brought in a bottle of absinthe . " " Perfumes the whole house , " said Mack . It was like old times , they reminded one another . if Gayp79were only here  --  let 's drink a toast to good old Gay , our departed friend . The absinthe had soothed the mixture in the keg and added something sweet and old-fashioned . A courtliness crept into the speech of the dwellers of the Palace Flophouse , an old-world courtesy . Everyone vied to be last , not first , at the refilled jug . " Next dough we get we 'll go up to Woolworth 's and get some glasses , " said Mack . " Hell , " said Whitey No. 2 , " they 'll just get broke . But I see what you mean . " Somehow they felt they were living in a moment when history pauses and takes stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this night as a beginning . At such times men feel the nudge toward oratory . Mack steadied himself against the stove and begged their attention by rapping on the stovepipe . " Gentlemen , " he said , " let us here highly resolve to get Doc 's ass out of the sling of despond . " Eddie said , " Remember we done something like that once and damn near ruined him . " Mack 's golden mood held . " We were younger then , " he said . " This time we 're going to think her out and she 's going to be foolproof . " Hazel was so far won back into comradeship that he had relaxed into happy incoherence . " To Lefty Grove ! " he said . Mack opened the oven door and sat on it . " I 've give it a lot of thought , " he said . " Lately I done hardly nothings else . "  | " You never do hardly nothing else , " said Whitey No. 2 . Mack ignored him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Eddie . " Who you talking to ? " said Whitey No. z . " I do n't know , " said Eddie innocently , " but if the shoe fits  --  " " I got a theory , if you ai n't too pie-eyed to listen , " said Mack . When he had them quiet he went on , " When you hear my theory you might get kind of violent . I want you to sleep on it before you talk . I think Doc needs a wife . " " What ! " " Well , hell , he do n't have to marry her , " said Mack . " You know what I mean . . . " If the absinthe had not given them tolerance he might have had a series of fights right then . " Kindly do not interrupt , " he said . " I will now review the dame situation in the U. S. You take a look at divorces and the reasons for them and you can only think one thing : the only guy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is the guy that 's going to marry her . That 's a fact . It 's a fact that if he 's left alone a guy practically always marries the wrong kind of dame . " " Play it safe and do n't marry nobody , " said Whitey No. 2 . " There 's some guys ca n't operate that way , " said Mack . " Are you suggesting we turn Doc , our true friend , in ? " " I asked you not to shoot off your face until you slepton it , " said Mack with dignity . Hazel tugged at his sleeve . " Ai n't you joking , Mack ? " " No , " said Mack , " I ai n't joking . " " If anything bad come to Doc , you know what I 'd do to you ? " Hazel asked  | " Yes , " said Mack . " I think 1 do  --  and I think I 'd have it coming . " Hazel 's bed was a four-poster on which the bedposts were two-by-fours topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a moving picture . When the Palace Flophouse was quiet at last , Hazel lay in his bed and looked up at the log-cabin pattern of his canopy . His mind was whirling . He wished there were some simpler way to help Doc than by the major operation Mack had suggested . Once he got up and looked out the door and saw that the green shaded light was on in the laboratory . " The poor bastard , " he whispered . He did n't sleep well and his dreams were shaped like mushrooms . Joe Elegant was a pale young man with bangs . He smoked foreign cigarettes in a long ebony holder and he cooked for the Bear Flag . The girls said he made the best popovers in the world , and he could give a massage that would shake the kinks out of a Saturday night when the fleet was in . He sneered most of the time , and except at mealtime kept to himself in his little lean-to behind the Bear Flag , from which the rattle of his typewriter could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come Suzy was having her coffee while Joe Elegant cleared the table of crumbs from earlier breakfasts . " You make good coffee , " Suzy said . " Thank you . " " You do n't look like a guy would work here . " " It 's temporary , I assure you . " " I got a wonderful recipe for gumbo . Want me to give it to you ? " " Fauna designs the meals . " " You ai n't very friendly . " " Why should I be ? " He was passing behind her . Suzy reached up , hooked her fingers in his shirt collar , twisted and yanked his face down level with her own . " Listen you , " she began , and she scowled into his popping eyes . " Oh , the hell with it , " said Suzy and released him . Joe Elegant stepped back and massaged his throat and smoothed his shirt . " Sorry , " said Suzy . " It 's quite all right . " " What makes you so mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " Where do you belong ? " " I do n't think you 'd understand . " " You too good for the place ? " " Let 's say I 'm different . " " No kidding ! " said Suzy . " I 'm writing a novel . " " You are ? What about ? I love novels . " " You would n't like this one . "  | " Why not ? " " You would n't understand it . " " Then what good is it ? " " It is n't intended for the mass . " " I 'm the mass , huh ? I guess you got something there . I bet you could write a pretty nice hunk of stuff . " Joe Elegant swallowed and his face twitched convulsively . " Sometime I 'll read you some of it . " " Say , that would be nice . But you said I could n't understand it . " " I 'll explain it as I go along . " " I 'd like that . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you like brownies ? " he asked . " I love them . " " I 'll make you some . Maybe you 'll come to my apartmentsome afternoon . I could give you a cup of tea . " " Say , you 're a nice fella ! Got any more coffee ? " " I 'll make a fresh pot . " Doc spent a restless night . His head was full of yellow pads and seers and octopi . Ordinarily he would have worked or read since he could n't sleep , but now if he turned on a light he would see the yellow pad and the marshaled pencils.  |p84As  the dawn crept over the bay he decided to go for a very long walk , perhaps to follow the shoreline all the way around to Carmel . He arose , and since it was still dusky in the laboratory he turned on the lights to make his coffee . Wide Ida , from the entrance of La Ida , saw his lights come on . She put an unlabeled pint bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Western Biological . " Doc , " she said , " would you work this stuff over ? " " What is it ? " " They say it 's whisky . I just want to know if it 'll kill anybody . I got a pretty good buy . They make it up in Pine Canyon . " " That 's against the law , " said Doc . " Killing people is against the law too , " said Wide Ida . Doc was torn between bootlegging and murder . He thought sadly that he was always involved in something like this  --  not good or bad but bad and less bad . He made a fairly quick analysis . " It 's not poison , " he said , " but it wo n't build good healthy stomachs . There 's some fusel oil in it . But I guess it 's no worse than Old Tennis Shoes . " " Thanks , Doc . What do I owe you ? " " Oh , maybe a quart  --  but not this stuff . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to go off the deep end , " said Doc . " Doc , I hear you got trouble . " " Me ? What kind of trouble ? " " I just heard , " said Wide Ida . Doc said angrily , " I 've got no trouble . What 's all the talk ! God Almighty , everybody treats me as though I had a disease . What kind of trouble ? "   " If there 's anything I can do , " she said and went out quickly , leaving the pint behind . Doc took a sip of it , made a face , and took a swig . His heart was pounding angrily . He could not admit that the pity of his friends only confirmed his frustration . He knew that pity and contempt are brothers . He set his chin . " I will get the spring tides at La Jolla , " he said to himself . " I will get a new microscope . " And the very lowest voice whispered , " Somewhere there 's warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viciously : " Parallels must be related . " He took another drink from the pint and opened yesterday 's mail . There was an order for six sets of slides  --  starfish , embryonic series , for the Oakland Poly-. technic High School . He was almost glad to do the old and practiced work . He got his collecting buckets together , threw rubber boots in his old car , and drove out to the Great Tide Pool . Some days are born ugly . From the very first light they are no damn good whatever the weather , and everybody knows it . No one knows what causes this , but on such a day people resist getting out of bed and set their heels against the day . When they are finally forced out by hungeror job they find that the day is just as lousy as they knew it would be.  |p86On  such a day it is impossible to make a good cup of coffee , shoestrings break , cups leap from the shelf by themselves and shatter on the floor , children ordinarily honest tell lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas range and lose the screws and have to be spanked . This is the day the cat chooses to have kittens and housebroken dogs wet on the parlor rug . Oh , it 's awful on such a day ! The postman brings overduebills . If it 's a sunny day it is too damn sunny , and if it is dark who can stand it ? Mack knew it was going to be that kind of a day . He could n't find his pants . He fell over a box that had crept out in his path . He cursed each brother in the Palace Flophouse , and on his way across the vacant lot he went out of his way to kick a dandelion flower . He was sitting gloomily on a pipe when Eddie came by , and so naturally he walked with Eddie to Wide Ida 's to try to do something about it . He hung around waiting for Wide Ida to go so that Eddie could slip him a drink : But Wide Ida was bending over the bar , cursing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time you get going there 's more taxes . You 're lucky , Mack . You do n't own nothing and you do n't make nothing . Until they start taxing skin , you 're safe . " " What 's the beef ? " Mack asked . " City and county taxes , " said Wide Ida . " On what ? " " On this place . It ai n't much , but I was fixed to put a down payment on a new Pontiac . " It was a statement that ordinarily would have aroused a detached compassion in Mack , together with mild self/congratulation that he was not burdened with taxable assets . But now a nagging worry fell on him , and he went back to the Palace Flophouse to worry in greater comfort . He went over the history of the Palace in his mind . It had belonged to Lee Chong . Long before the war Mack and the boys had rented it from him for five dollars a month , and , naturally enough , they had never paid any rent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Lee Chong sold out to Joseph and Mary . Did the Palace go with the rest ? Mack did n't know , but if it did , the Patron did n't know it . He was no Lee Chong . He would have demanded the rent . But if the Patron did own the place , he would get a tax bill . If he got a tax bill , he was sure to be on the necks of Mack and the boys . The Patron was not a man to pay out money without getting more money back , that was certain . It seemed very unjust . Their home , their security , even their social standing , were cast in the balance . Mack lay on his bed and considered what could be done . Suppose the Patron demanded back rent  --  clear back for years . You could n't trust a man like that . What a lousy day it was ! Mack did n't know what to do , so he called a meeting of the boys , even sent Hazel to bring Eddie back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shaken assembly . Mack explained all the angles until even Hazel seemed to understand the danger . The boys studied their fingers , looked at the ceiling , blew on their knuckles . Eddie got up and walked around his chair to change his thinking luck . At last Whitey No. 2 said , " We could steal his mail so he wo n't get no tax bill . "  | " It ai n't practical , " said Mack . " Even if it was n't a crime . " Hazel offered , " We could kill him . " " You ai n't heard that 's against the law too ? " Mack asked . " I mean , make it like an accident , " said Hazel . " He could fall off Point Lobos . " " Then somebody else inherits the joint and we do n't even know who . " The injustice in the theory of private ownership of real estate was descending on them . " Maybe we could get Doc to talk to him . He likes Doc . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his attention , " said Mack . " Hell , he might even raise the rent . " " He might even try to collect it , " said Eddie . Hazel was going into a slow but luminous burn . He gazed about the whitewashed walls of the Palace Flophouse , at the Coca-Cola calendar girls , at the great and ancient woodstove , at the grandfather clock , at the framed portrait of Romie Jacks . There were honest , unabashed tears in Hazel 's eyes . " The son-of-a-bitch , " he said . " After all our work he takes away our home  --  the only place where I ever been happy . How can a guy be so goddam mean ? " " He ai n't done it yet , " said Mack . " He do n't even know about it maybe . " " I wish Doc owned the place , " said Eddie . " We would n't have no trouble with Doc . " Mack looked at him quickly . " What put that in your head ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail for weeks on end . Docp89would forget to collect the rent and he 'd forget to open a tax bill . " Excitement shone in Mack 's eyes . " Eddie , " he said , " maybe you put your finger in it . " " In what ? " " I got to think it over , " said Mack , " but just maybe our darling Eddie here is a genius . " Eddie blushed with pleasure . " What 'd I do , Mack ? " " I ca n't tell you now . " " Hell , Mack , I want to know what I done . " " It was smart , " said Mack . " It was a stroke of just pure wonderful . Now let 's give the Patron a going-over . How much guts you think he 's got ? " " Plenty , " said Hazel . " And he 's plenty wise . " Mack spoke slowly , thinking aloud . " Let 's see . Joseph and Mary , you might say , is a con man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a nice dresser , " said Hazel . " A con man ca n't make enemies unless , of course , he wants to get out of town . He got to keep everybody happy and friendly . " " Come on , Mack , " Whitey No. i demanded . " Tell us ! " " Fellas , " said Mack , " if I blowed it now and it was n't no good , why , you 'd kind of lose face in me . I want to think this one out and see if I ca n't kind of surround him . But if we do her , you 'll all have to help . " " Do what ? " " Let me alone now , boys , " said Mack , and he went back to his bed and put his head on his crossed hands and studied the rafters of the Palace Flophouse.  |p90Hazel  came quietly to his bedside . " You wo n't let nobodytake our home away , will you , Mack ? " " I promise ! " said Mack fervently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wide Ida 's . " " Will you do something for me , Hazel ? " " Sure , Mack . " " Take that lard can over there and see can Eddie fill it full of beer without too much fuss . It 'll help me to think better . " " You 'll get your beer , " said Hazel . " You just keep thinking , Mack . Say , Mack , how do you think Eddie always got a stroke of genius even when he do n't know it and I do n't never have none ? " " Come again ? " said Mack . " How come  --  oh , the hell with it ! " said Hazel . Fauna had made a success of three improbable enterprises . More than likely she could have held her own in steel or chemicals , maybe even in General Electric , for Fauna had the proper ingredients for modern business . She was benevolentand at the same time solvent , public-spirited and privately an individualist , open-handed but with a delicate sense of double-entry bookkeeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the board ofp91a large corporation . And Fauna took a deep personal interestin her girls . Shortly after she took over the Bear Flag , Fauna set aside and decorated the Ready Room . It was a large and pleasant apartment with three windows overlooking the vacant lot . Fauna put in deep chairs and couches covered with bright , flower-littered glazed chintz . The drapes matched the furniture , and the pictures were designed to soothe without arousing interest  --  engravings of cows in ponds , deer in streams , dogs in lakes . Wet animals seem to serve some human need . For recreation Fauna provided a table-tennis set , a card table , and a parchesi board . The Ready Room was a place to relax , to read , to gossip , to study , and some of these things were actually done by the girls of the Bear Flag . One wall was dominated by a large framed board on which were pasted enormous gold stars , and this was Fauna 's personal pride . The Ready Room was gay and feminine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned in the blackened lap of a crouching plaster Buddha . At about a quater to three Agnes and Mabel and Becky were relaxing in the Ready Room . It was the time of languor . The vacant lot was washed in clear pale sunshine , which made even the rusty pipes and the old boiler look beautiful . The tall mallow weeds were as sweetly green as a garden . A sleek , gray , lazy Persian cat hunted gophers in the grass and did n't care whether she caught one or not . Mabel stood at the window . She said , " I heard some peopleused to live in that old boiler . " Agnes was painting her toenails and waving her feet top92dry the enamel . " That 's before your time , " she said . " Mr. and Mrs. Malloy , they had it fixed up nice  --  awning out front , oriental rug . Once you got inside , through the firedoor , it was real nice . She was a homemaker . " " Why 'd they leave ? " Becky asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would n't let her because there was n't no windows . When they argued it kind of echoed in there and got on their nerves . He said there was n't room inside to take a swing at her . He 's in the county jail now  --  trusty . Mrs. Malloy 's slinging hash in a grease joint over at Salinas , waiting for him to get out . They was real nice people . He 's a high Elk . " Mabel moved away from the window . " You heard the Rattlesnake Club is coming from Salinas tonight ? Took the whole house over . " " Yeah , " said Becky . " They 're having a memorial meeting for dead members . Fauna give them a rate . " Agnes lifted her left leg and blew on her toenails . " Like this color ? " she asked . " It 's nice , " said Becky . " Looks a little like you was rotting . Say , where in hell is Suzy ? She 'll find out when Fauna says three o'clock she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . " Mabel said , " Her name used to be Flora . What is a fauna anyway ? I never knew nobody named that . " " Oh , it 's like a baby deer , " said Becky . " I do n't think Suzy 'll be here long . She 's kind of nuts  --  got a nuts look in her eye . Goes out walking . " Mabel said , " Well , it 's two minutes to three . Suzy better get here . "  |p93On  the stroke of three a door opened and Fauna came in from her bedroom . A silver headband was tied around her orange hair , and it made her look like a certain social leader recently deceased . Fauna had the elegance found only in the drawing rooms of the old rich and in haute monde brothels . She was heavy but she moved with light , deft steps . She carried a large basket . " Where 's Suzy ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " said Mabel . " Well , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the parchesi board . " Somebody 's been shooting craps with the parchesi dice , " she said . " How 'd you know ? " Becky asked . " There 's two bucks in the corner pocket . I do n't want gambling in the Ready Room . If a young lady wants to run a few passes with a customer , that 's different , but I do n't want to find no more pencil marks on the lump sugar either . Gambling 's a vice . I knew many a good hooker with a future that 's throwed it away on games of chance . " " Hell , Fauna , you play poker , " said Becky . " Poker ai n't a game of chance , " said Fauna . " And you watch your language , Becky . Vulgarity gives a hookshop a bad name . " She took a linen tablecloth from her basket and spread it over the parchesi board . Then she laid out a napkin , a plate , wineglasses , and a heap of flat silver . Mabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like my young ladies to be late . " She took a teacher 's pointer from her basket . " Now , what young lady wants to be first ? " Agnes said , " I 'll do her . "  | " You done it yesterday , " said Mabel . " Goddam it , it 's my turn ! " Fauna said sternly , " Young ladies , suppose some nice dumb young fellow was to hear you . Now , Mabel  --  " She indicated the items on the tablecloth with a pointer , and Mabel began , like a child reciting poetry , " Oyster fork ... salad fork . . . fish fork . . . roast fork . . savory fork . . . dessert fork . . . plate ... dessert knife .. . savory knife . . . roast knife . . . fish knife  --  " " Good ! " said Fauna . " Now here . " And Mabel went on , " Water ... white wine . . . claret . . . burgundy .. . port ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which side does the salad go on ? " " Left side , so you can get your sleeve in the gravy . " Fauna was deeply gratified . " By God , that 's good ! I would n't be surprised if Mabel was n't one of them stars before too long . " She indicated the gold stars on the wall . " What are they ? " Suzy asked . Fauna said proudly , " Every one of them stars represents a young lady from the Bear Flag that married , and married well . That first star 's got four kids and her husband 's managerof an A and P. Third from the end is president of the Salinas Forward and Upward Club and held the tree on Arbor Day . Next star is high up in the Watch and Ward , sings alto in the Episcopal church in San Jose . My young ladies go places . Now , Suzy  --  " " Huh ? " " What 's that ? " " That funny kind of fork ? " " What 's it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cooperate , Suzy . What do you eat with it ? " Suzy mused , " You could n't get much mashed potatoes on it . Pickles maybe ? " " It 's a clam fork , " said Fauna . " Now say it . Clam fork . " Suzy said vehemently , " I would n't eat a clam if you was to give me a scoop shovel . " " What a mug ! " said Agnes . Suzy turned on her . " I ai n't no mug ! " Mabel cried , " Double negative ! Double negative ! " " What you talking about ? " said Suzy . Mabel said , " When you say you ai n't no mug , that means you 're a mug . " Suzy started for her . " Who 's a mug ? " Fauna bellowed , " If certain young ladies do n't come to order they 're going to get a paste in the puss ! Now  --  posture . Where 's the books ? " Agnes said , " I think Joe Elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Fauna , " I picked them books special so 's nobody 'd take them . What 's he reading them for ? Breeder 's Journal , California Civil Code , and a novel by Sterling North  --  what the hell is there to read ? Well , we 'll just have to use the basket , I guess . Agnes , put the basket on your head . " Fauna inspected her . " Now look here , young ladies , " she said . " Just because you got your ankles together and your hips flang forward  --  that do n't necessarily mean posture . Agnes , tuck in your butt ! Posture 's a state of mind . Real posture is when a young lady 's flat on her ass and still looks like she got books on her head . " There came a knock on the door and Joe Elegant handedp96Fauna a note . She read it and sighed with pleasure . " That Mack , " she said . " What a gent ! I guess he 'd drain the embalmingfluid off his dead grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is his grandma dead ? " Agnes asked . " Who knows ? " said Fauna . " Listen to this , young ladies . Mack and the boys request the pleasure of your company at their joint tomorrow aft . to drink a slug of good stuff and talk about something important . Bring the girls . R.S.V.P. ' " Fauna paused . " He could of yelled outside the window , but not Mack  --  he requests the pleasure of our company . " She sighed . " What a gent ! If he was n't such a bum I 'd aim one of you young ladies at him . " Agnes asked , " What 's the matter with Mack 's grandma ? " " I do n't even know he 's got a grandma , " said Fauna . " Now when we go over there tomorrow , you young ladies keep your traps shut and just listen . " She mused , " Somethingimportant  --  well , it might be like Mack needs twenty bucks , so just keep your heads shut and let me do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heel of her hand . " I nearly forgot ! Joe Elegant baked a great big goddamcake . Suzy , you take four cold cans of beer and that cake and go over and give them to Doc to cheer him up . " " Okay , " said Suzy . " But it 'll probably molt in his stom-ach . " " His stomach ai n't none of your business , " said Fauna . And when Suzy had gone Fauna said , " I wisht I could stick up a star for that kid . She do n't hardly pull her own weight here . "  |p97Doc  laid ten big starfish out on a shelf , and he set up a line of eight glass dishes half filled with sea water . Although he was inclined to carelessness in his living arrangements his laboratory technique was immaculate . The making of the embryo series gave him pleasure . He had done it hundreds of times before , and he felt a safety in the known thing  --  no speculation here . He did certain things and certain other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old life came back to him  --  a plateau of contentment with small peaks of excitement but none of the jagged pain of original thinking , none of the loneliness of invention . His phonograph played softly , played the safe and certain fugues of Bach , clear as equations . As he worked , a benign feeling came over him . He liked himself again as he once had ; liked himself as a person , the way he might like anyone else . The self-hatred which poisons so many people and which had been irritating him was gone for the time . The top voice of his mind sang peacefulness and order , and the raucous middle voice was gentle ; it mumbled and snarled but it could not be heard . The lowest voice of all was silent , dreaming of a warm safe sea . The rattlesnakes in their wire cage suddenly lifted their heads , felt the air with their forked tongues , and then allp98four set up a dry buzzing rattle . Doc looked up from his work as Mack came in . Mack glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to me yet , " he said . " Takes a little time , " said Doc . " You have n't been here much . " " Did n't feel no welcome here , " said Mack . " I 'm sorry , Mack . I guess I 've been off my feed . I 'll try to do better . " " You going to let up on them devilfish ? " " I do n't know . " " They was making you sick . " Doc laughed . " It was n't the octopi . I guess it was trying to think . I 'd got out of the habit . " " I never got the habit , " said Mack . " That 's not true , " said Doc . " I never knew anyone who devoted more loving thought to minisculae . " " I never even heard of them , " said Mack . " Say , Doc , what do you think of the Patron  --  your honest , spit-in-thelakeopinion ? " " I do n't think I understand him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't kidding , " said Mack . " He ai n't honest . " Doc said , " I 'd call that expert testimony . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean you bring some experience to bear . " " Oh , I know what you mean , " said Mack earnestly , " but you search your heart , Doc , and see if I ai n't dishonest in a kind of honest way . I do n't really fool nobody  --  not even myself . And there 's another thing  --  I know when I 'm doing it . Joseph and Mary ca n't tell the difference . "  | " I think that might be true , " said Doc . " What I 'm wondering is  --  well , I do n't think the Patron wants any trouble around here , do you ? " " Nobody wants any trouble . " " He 's got a stake here , " Mack went on . " If the whole Row took a skunner to him , why , he just could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I knew what you were talking about , it might help , " said Doc . " I 'm just trying to figure something , " said Mack . " Well , if you mean that the Patron is in kind of a sensitiveposition  --  " " That 's what I do mean , " said Mack . " He ca n't afford to have no enemies . " " Nobody wants enemies , " said Doc . " I know . But he could get his ass in a sling . He got a business and he 's got property . " " I see what you mean , " said Doc . " You 're going to pressurehim and you want to know what he 'll do . What are you going to try to take away from him , Mack ? " " I 'm just thinking , " said Mack . " I never knew you to think idly . When you think , some-1 body gets hurt . " " I never hurt nobody , Doc . " " Well , not bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mack was uneasy . He had not intended the conversation to turn to him . He changed the subject . " Say , Doc , did you hear ? The whole country club took a loyalty oath on the eighteenth green . Whitey No. 2 was caddying . Them members all took off their hats and swore they would not destroy the U. S. government . "  | " I 'm glad , " said Doc . " I was worried . Did the caddies take the oath too ? " " Some of them did , but not Whitey . He 's kind of an idealist , you might say . He says if he gets an idea to burn down the Capitol he do n't want no perjury rap to stand in his way . They wo n't let him caddy no more . " " Does he want to burn down the Capitol ? " Doc asked . " Well , no . He says he do n't want to now , but he do n't know what he 'll want to do next month . He give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Marine , went through a lot of fighting for the country , figures he 's got a kind of personal interest . He do n't want nobody to tell him what to do . " Doc laughed . " So he ca n't carry golf clubs any more because of his ideals ? " " They say he 's a security risk , " said Mack . " Whitey claims he ai n't got a good enough memory to be a security risk . Besides , they do n't talk about nothing out there on the golf course except money and dames . " Doc said , " Heroes always get punished at first . " " Speaking of dames , Doc  --  " " Let 's , " said Doc . " Whatever happened to that swell-looking babe in the fur coat used to come over ? " " She 's not been very well . " " That 's too bad , " said Mack . " What 's she got ? " " Oh , something obscure . Ca n't seem to track it down . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean ? " " I seen it happen so many times , " said Mack . " You take a dame and she 's married to a guy that 's making twenty/five bucks a week . You ca n't kill her with a meat ax . She 's got kids and does the washing  --  may get a little tired but that 's the worse that can happen to her . But let the guy get raised to seventy-five bucks a week and she begins to get colds and take vitamins . " " That 's a new theory of medicine , " said Doc . " It ai n't new . Hell , just use your eyes . Guy gets up to a hundred a week and this same dame reads Time magazine and she 's got the newest disease before she even finished the page . I 've knew dames that can give doctors cards , spades , and big cassino about medicine . They got stuff called allergy now . Used to call it hay fever  --  made you sneeze . Guy that figured out allergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get sick when there 's something you do n't want to do . I 've knew dames that was allergic to dishwater . Married guy starts making dough  --  he 's got a patient on his hands . " " You sound cynical , " said Doc . " No , I ai n't . You just look around and show me one well dame with her old man in the chips . " Doc chuckled . " You think that 's what happened to my friend ? " " Oh , hell no , " said Mack . " That 's big stuff . When you get dough like that it 's different . She got to have something that do n't nobody know what it is . She ca n't have nothing common that you can take salts for . She goes around puzzlingdoctors . They stand around her and they shake their heads and they scratch and they never seen nothing like her case before . " " I have n't heard you go on like this for a long time , " said Doc.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think them doctors is honest ? " " I have n't any reason to doubt it . Why ? " " I bet I could fix rich dames up , " said Mack . " At least for a while . " " How would you go about it ? " " Well , sir , first I 'd hire me a deaf-and-dumb assistant . His job is just to set and listen and look worried . Then I 'd get me a bottle of Epsom salts and I 'd put in a pretty little screwcap thing and I 'd call it Moondust . I 'd charge about thirty dollars a teaspoonful , and you got to come to my office to get it . Then I 'd invent me a machine you strap the dame in . It 's all chrome and it lights colored lights every minute or so . It costs the dame twelve dollars a half-hour and it puts her through the motions she 'd do over a scrub board . I 'd cure them ! And I 'd make a fortune too . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have something else , like mixed sleeping pills and wake-up pills that keeps you right where you was when you started . " Doc said , " Thank God you have n't got a license to practice ! " " Why ? " " As a matter of fact , I do n't know why , " said Doc . " How about preventive medicine ? " " You mean how to keep them from getting sick ? " " Yes . " " That 's easy , " said Mack . " Stay broke ! " Doc sat silent for a while . He glanced at the starfish and saw the reproductive fluid beginning to ooze from between their rays . " Say , Mack , " he asked , " did you come over to try to get something out of me ? "  | " I do n't think so , " said Mack . " If I did I 've forgot what it was . I 'm sure glad you got over it , Doc . " " Got over what ? " " Oh , them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudden anger welled up in Doc . " Do n't get any funny ideas . I am going to write that paper . I am going to La Jolla for the spring tides . " " All right , Doc , all right . Have it your own way . " But back in the Palace Flophouse Mack reported to the boys , " Seemed like he was better , but he ai n't over the hump yet . We got to help him not to write that goddam paper . " Suzy was light on her feet . She was up the stairs and knocking on the door of Western Biological before the snakes rattled . Doc called , " Come in , " without looking up from his microscope . Suzy stood in the doorway . She held a gigantic flop cake on one hand and carried a paper bag of canned beer in the other . " How do you do , " she said formally . Doc looked up . " Oh , hello . For God 's sake , what 's that ? " " A cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doc asked . " I think Fauna told him to . " " Well , I hope you like cake , " said Doc.  |p104Suzy  laughed . " I do n't think this is a eating cake . This is a looking cake . Fauna sent you some beer . " " That 's more like it , " said Doc . " What 's Fauna want ? " " Nothing . " " That 's funny . " " Where shall I put the cake ? " said Suzy . Now Doc looked at Suzy and Suzy looked at Doc and they both had the same thought and they burst into laughter . Tears streamed from Suzy 's eyes . " Oh , Lord ! " said Suzy . " Oh , Lord ! " She laughed with her mouth wide and her eyes pinched shut . Doc slapped his leg and threw back his head and roared . And the laughter was so pleasant they tried to keep it going after its momentum was spent . " Oh , Lord , " said Suzy , " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on top of the rattlesnake cage , and hysterical rattling filled the room . Suzy jumped back . " What 's that ? " " Rattlesnakes . " " What you got them for ? " " I take their venom and sell it . " " I 'd hate to live with a bunch of dirty snakes . " " They 're not dirty . They even change their skins . That 's more than people do . " " I hate them , " said Suzy , and she shuddered . " You would n't , once you knew them . " " Well I ai n't likely to get to know them , " said Suzy . " They 're dirty . " Doc leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs . Hesaid , " You know , this interests me . Snakes are cleaner thanmost animals . Wonder why you call them dirty ? " Suzy looked at him levelly . " You want to know why ? " " Sure I do . "  | " Because you run Fauna down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that got  --  I did not ! " " You said Fauna 's trying to get something out of you . She just done it to be nice . " Doc nodded his head slowly . " I see . So you got even by calling snakes dirty . " " You got it , mister . Nobody do n't run Fauna down when I 'm around . " " It was just a joke , " said Doc . " Did n't sound like no joke to me . " " Why , Fauna 's one of my best friends , " said Doc . " Let 's have a can of beer and make peace . " " Okay , " said Suzy . " You make the first move . " Doc said , " Tell Joe Elegant it 's an incredible cake . " " Got marshmallow frosting , " said Suzy . " And tell Fauna the beer saved my life . " Suzy 's face relaxed . " Okay , " she said . " I guess that 's okay . Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " Suzy brought the two punched cans to Doe 's work table . " Say , what you doing ? " " Making slides . When I started I put starfish sperm and ova in each of these glasses . Then every half-hour I kill one glass of the developing embryos , and when I have the whole series , I mount them on slides like this , and one slide shows the whole development . " Suzy bent over the dishes . " I do n't see nothing . " " They 're too small . I can show you in the glass . " Suzy backed up . " What do you do it for ? " " So students can see how starfish get to be . "  | " Why do they want to know ? " " Well , I guess because that 's the way people get to be . " " Then why do n't they study people ? " Doc laughed . " It 's a little difficult to kill unborn babies every half-hour . Here , take a look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzy peered in the eyepieces . " God Almighty ! " she said . " Did I look like that once ? " " Something like . " " Sometimes I feel like that now . Say , Doc , you got a funny business  --  bugs and all like that . " " There are funnier businesses , " he said sharply . She stiffened . " Meaning my business ? You do n't like my business , huh ? " " It does n't matter whether I like it or not . There it is . But it does seem to me a kind of sad substitute for love  --  a kind of lonesome substitute . " Suzy put her hands on her hips . " And what 've you got , mister ? Bugs , snakes ? Look at this dump ! It stinks . Floor ai n't been clean in years . You ai n't got a decent suit of clothes . You probably ca n't remember your last hot meal . You sit here breeding bugs  --  for Chrissake ! What do you think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been amused , but now his guard was down and he caught her anger like a disease . " I do what I want , " he said . " I live the way I want . I 'm free  --  do you get that ? I 'm free and I do what I want . " " You ai n't got nothing , " Suzy said . " Bugs and snakes and a dirty house . I bet some dame threw you over . That 's what you 're substituting for . Got a wife ? No ! Got a girl ? No ! "  |p107Doc  found himself shouting , " 1 do n't want a wife . I have all the women I want ! " " Woman and women is two different things , " said Suzy . " Guy knows all about women he do n't know nothing about a woman . " Doc said , " This guy is happy that way . " " Now you 're happy ! " said Suzy . " You 're a pushover ! If no dame 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who the hell would want to live with bugs and snakes in a joint like this ? " " Who 'd want to go to bed with anybody that 's got three bucks ? " said Doc cruelly . Suzy said icily , " A smart guy . A real smart guy . He 's got what he wants . Seems to me I heard you 're writing a great big goddam highfalutin paper . " " Who told you that ? " " Everybody knows about it . Everybody 's laughing at you behind your back  --  and you know why ? Because everybody knows you 're kidding yourself . You ai n't never going to write that paper because you ca n't write that paper . You 're just sitting here like a kid playing wish games . " She saw her words go home as surely as though she had watched arrows drive into his chest , and misery and shame overwhelmed her . " I wish I did n't say that , " she spoke softly . " I wish to God I never said that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly . " Maybe you put your finger on the truth . Is everybody laughing at me ? Is everybody laughing  --  ? " " My name 's Suzy , " she said . " Are they laughing , Suzy ? "  | " They got no right to , " she said . " I was just fighting back  --  honest to God I was . I did n't mean any of that stuff I said . " " I love true things , " said Doc . " Even when they hurt . Is n't it better to know the truth about oneself ? " And he asked it of himself . " Yes , I think it is . I think it is . You 're quite right , I 've got nothing . That 's why I built up the whole story about my paper until I believed it myself  --  a little man pretending to be a big man , a fool trying to be wise . " " Fauna will kill me , " Suzy moaned . " She 'll wring my neck . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk from a two-bit hustler  --  you got no right . " " What 's it matter where the truth comes from , " he said , " if it 's the truth ? " Suzy said , " Doc , I never felt so lousy in my life . Get mad at me , wo n't you ? " " Why should I get mad ? Maybe you 've stopped a bunch of nonsense . Perhaps you 've nipped a fool in the bud . " " Get mad at me , " she begged . " Here ! Take a punch at me . " Doc chuckled . " I wish it could be that easy . " Suzy said sadly , " Then I ai n't got any choice , " and she shrilled at him , " Why you goddam bum ! You lousy stinkingfool ! Who the hell d' you think you are ? " There was a flutter of footsteps and the door burst open . It was Becky . " Suzy ! You 're late . The Rattlesnakes are here . Come on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Love Apples , ' " said Suzy quietly . " So long , Doc , " and she followed Becky out . Doc watched them go . He said aloud , " That 's probablyp109the only completely honest human I have ever met . " His eyes wandered to the table and suddenly he bellowed , " Goddam it ! She made me miss the time . The dirty bitch ! I 've got to do it all over . " And he dumped the contents of the glass dishes into his slop bucket . Not the least important and valuable custom Fauna brought to the Bear Flag was the little time of rest and contemplationin the Ready Room after work and before sleep . Grievances were brought out and inspected , quarrels were settled , and all the little matters of interest and despair were turned over and examined for their actual value . Then praise or blame were assigned and plans for improvement were laid out with lore and tact learned in other fields . Fauna warped and nudged and bunted her young ladies toward good nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not unusual for light refreshments to be served , and on occasion the young ladies ' voices joined in song  --  " Home Sweet Home , " " Old Black Joe , " " Down by the Old Mill Stream , " " Harvest Moon . " Dog watch in the Ready Room was a medicine to weary nerves and frayed bodies . The Bear Flag was shorthanded the night of the memorialmeeting for dead members sponsored by the RattlesnakeClub of Salinas . Helen and Wisteria were doing sixtyp110days for a lady fight that is still discussed with admiration in Cannery Row . When the last Rattlesnake had gone and the big front door was closed , the girls wandered wearily into the Ready Room , sat down , and kicked off their shoes . Becky said , " One of them Rattlesnakes tonight called us an institution and a landmark . " Agnes said acidly , " We get a few more like Suzy and it 'll be a institution all right . I got an uncle in a institution . He goes right on fighting the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm right here , " said Suzy , entering . " I was getting that cracked record out of the juke-box . Am I pooped ! Let 's put it in the sack . " " Before Fauna gives us good night ? You crazy ? " Mabel said . " She 'd bust a gut . " Becky sighed . " What a night ! This is one time the group rate paid off . Them Rattlesnakes ai n't turned a trick since midnight but they sure was active . " " They was going fine until they run out of liquor , " said Mabel . " That new stuff Wide Ida sent in must be made of jumping beans . " Suzy said , " I figured if that short one told me once more how his little boy cut a worm in two with a shovel  --  " " Oh , you got it too , huh ? Know what the little bastard said ? Only four years old too . He said , I cut a wum . ' Now if he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times . " " That bald one ! " said Mabel . " Did his wife have an operation ! They turned her inside out . Sounded like theyp111was pelting her . He got crying so hard I never did find out what she had . " " A malignant artichoke , " said Becky . " I made him say it slow . " Agnes asked , " Say , who is this guy Sigmund Ki they was singing about ? " " Never heard of him , " said Becky . " I once knew a dame said she was the original Frankie though . " " I 've personally knew three original Frankies , " said Mabel . " Suzy , you got to stop arguing with the customers . " Suzy said , " If that 's the live members of the Rattlesnake Club , the dead ones is what I call dead . I can scream twice at a rubber lizard and then the hell with it . " Fauna came out of the bedroom office and stood in the doorway , rubbing lotion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown . She said seriously , " Young ladies , you can make fun of the Rattlesnakes if you want to , but if you ever get in the administration end you will welcome good solid citizens like them . Why , there was some very important people here from Salinas ! I give them a good rate , but you notice there 's no busted furniture . Them free-spending sailors last Saturday night cost me eighty-five dollars in repairs . That nice boy give Becky a five-dollar tip  --  but he busted two windows and run off with the deer-antler halltree . " Suzy said , " God , I 'm sleepy . " Fauna said sharply , " Suzy , I got one rule : never let the sun rise on a cross word or an unbalanced book . " She scratched her nose with a pencil . " I just wish there was more Rattlesnakes , " she said.  | " I wish there was more dead members , " Suzy said . " That 's a cross word , Suzy ! " said Fauna . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now let 's relax . Who wants a beer ? " Becky said , " If I say I want it I 'll have to get it for everybody . My dogs are tired ! You know what I was dancing ? A quadrille ! " Fauna said dryly , " I seen you . I 'll have to give you some lessons , I guess . You done a kootch quadrille . It ai n't your feet should be tired . After all the posture lessons I give you , you still dance like a harlot . " " What 's a harlot ? " Becky asked . " A whore , " said Mabel . " Oh , harlot , huh ? " said Becky . Agnes said , " Fauna , I want you should tell Suzy when she goes on errands she should come back . She stayed over Doc 's about an hour while the Rattlesnakes was really ac-tive . " Suzy asked , " Say , Fauna , what 's wrong with Doc ? " " Wrong ? Ai n't nothing wrong with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nicest fellas ever lived on Cannery Row . You 'd think he 'd turn bitter the way everybody hustles him . Wide Ida gets him to analyze her booze , Mack and the boys throw the hook into him for every dime that sticks out , a kid cuts his finger on the Row and he goes to Doc to get it wrapped up . Why , when Becky got in a fight with that Woodman of the World and got bit in the shoulder , she might of lost her arm if it was n't for Doc . Show her the scar , Becky . " Suzy asked , " Do n't Doc never come here ? "  | " No , he do n't . But do n't let nothing ever give you the idea he 's strange . There 's girls goes in there with fur coats and stuff and he plays that churchy kind of music . Doc 's all right . He gets what he wants . Dora said every girl made a play for him . I put a stop to that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm saving him  --  that 's why . You look at them gold stars over there  --  every star , one of my girls has married well . " Suzy said , " Who marries hustlers ? " " Now that 's a bad attitude to take , " Fauna said coldly . " That 's the kind of attitude I try to discourage . You look at that third star from the end over there . I admit she 's kind of snooty , but why should n't she be ? She 's a reader in a big church in San Luis Obispo . I tell you , my girls marry , and marry well ! " Suzy said , " What 's that got to do with Doc ? " " I got him staked out for Miss Right , " said Fauna . " Someday I 'll draw a bead on him . " " Hell , " said Suzy , " he said he do n't want to marry no-body . " " Watch your language , Suzy , " said Fauna . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along with him ? " " We got in a hassle , " said Suzy . " He made me mad and I made him mad . All them goddam bugs  --  and a paper about nervous breakdowns in devilfish ! Someday a guy in a white coat 's going to tap him on the shoulder . " Fauna said , " Do n't believe it ! Why , some of them bugs he gets as much as ten bucks for . " " Not apiece ? " said Suzy.  |p114Fauna  went on , " Why , he takes an old beat-up cat he paid a quarter for and he shoots red and blue and yellow paint in it and he gets fifteen bucks for it . " " Why , for Chrissake ? " Suzy asked . " Suzy , if you do n't watch your language I 'll wash out your mouth . Now you just get up and bring the beer for that . You 're an ignorant girl but I 'll be goddamned if I 'll let you get common . " Suzy went out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for Doc  --  she 's got an awful big mouth . She 'd talk her way out of an apple dumpling . " Suzy came back with a tray of beer bottles . Becky said , " Fauna , why do n't you read Suzy 's horo-scope ? " " You mean stars and like that ? " said Suzy . " What for ? " Becky said , " To see if you 're going to marry Doc . " Suzy said angrily , " I like a joke as good as anybody butdo n't get rough with me . " Becky said , " Who 's rough ? " " I do n't believe that crap about stars , " said Suzy . " And you lay off talking about Doc . He 's been to college  --  he 's read so many books he ca n't count ' em  --  and not comic books neither . You lay off talking about him and me . " Fauna said , " That will be enough , miss . You see that chart ? Just look at them gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a gold star on it . That young lady ' is married to a professor at Stanford . He 's got about a million books , and she used to take all day Sunday figuring out Jiggs and Maggie . You know what she does ? If somebodypoints to all them books and says , Does the little lady read all of them ? ' she just smiles kind of quiet and mysteri/ous . When they ask her a question , you know what she does ? You can learn , Suzy , if you just pay attention . She repeats the last three words anybody says , and first thing you know , they think she said it . Why , her own husband thinks she can read and write ! You get smart , Suzy . Doc do n't want no dame that knows as much as him . What would he have to talk about ? Let him tell you for once . Do n't tell him . " Becky said , " She wo n't . She loves to shoot off her face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't be no gold star , " said Fauna . " That 's a good idea about the horoscope . When 's your birthday , Suzy ? " " February twenty-third . " " What time was you born ? " " God knows , but I think it was leap year . " Agnes said , " I bet she was born at night . I can always tell . " Fauna went into her room and brought back a chart and pinned it to the wall . And she brought out her schoolroom* pointer again . " Now this here 's you , Pisces  --  that 's fish . " Suzy said , " You mean I 'm fish ? " " You 're fish , " said Fauna . " I do n't believe a goddam word of it . I do n't even like fish , " Suzy said . " Why , hell , I break out if I look at a fish ! " " Do n't look at them then , " said Fauna . " But if you ai n't lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  fish is to Jupiter , carry two in the Saturn , and three left over in the House of Venus  --  " " I do n't believe none of it , " Suzy said . Fauna looked up from her figuring . " Tell her some of that stuff I done , Mabel . "  |p116Mabel  said , " I seen her do wonderful stuff . I had a pup one time . Fauna , she done a horoscope on him . It says on that pup 's third birthday , ten o'clock , he 's going explode . " Suzy asked , " Did he ? " " W ell , no . Something went haywire with the chart , I guess . Ten o'clock on that dog 's third birthday he caught fire . I was taking a lemon rinse . " " You could use one now , " Fauna said . " What caught him on fire ? " Suzy asked . " He just caught . Spontaneous something or other . Hewas a pretty good dog but he was n't very bright . Nevercould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Suzy said , " I bet Joe Elegant set him on fire . " " That 's a lie ! " said Mabel . " Joe Elegant was in thehospital . " Suddenly Fauna clapped her hands to her brow . " God Almighty ! " " What is it ? " said Becky . " What 's the matter ? " Fauna said impressively , " Suzy , you know what you'regoing to marry ? You 're going to marry a Cancer ! " " Thought you caught it , " said Suzy . " I did n't knowyou had to marry it . " " Do n't get funny , " said Fauna . " Cancer , that 's a crab  --  and that 's also July . Now you just think  --  who works with crabs and stuff like that ? " Becky said , " Joe Anguro 's fish market . " Fauna exploded , " Doc ! And if his birthday 's in July he 's a gone goose . Agnes , when 's Doc 's birthday ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we 'll have to find out . Ca n't let him know why we want to know . "  |p117Agnes  said , " Mack will find out . Mack 's used to hustling Doc . " " Well , I want to know right away . Now you young ladies get some sleep , you hear me ? You know what 's coming in today ? " Fauna stuck the pencil in her hair . " A great big fat juicy destroyer ! And you know what day it is ? " The girls spoke in a chorus . " Lord-God-Almighty , " they said , " payday ! " It took Fauna about five minutes to put up her hair and then she was ready to make her final rounds to see that the garbage was out and all the lights turned off . In the dark Ready Room she saw a glowing cigarette . " Who 's there ? " she called . " Me , " said Suzy . " Why ai n't you in bed ? " " I was thinking . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking about , your horoscope ? " " Yeah . " " You like Doc , huh ? " " I put the knife in him . He made me mad . " " Why n't you let me handle it ? " said Fauna . " I think I could maybe get him for you . " " He do n't want a wife , and if he did , he do n't want nobody like me . " " People do n't know what they want , " said Fauna . " They got to be pushed . Why would guys in their right mind want to get married ? But they do . " " Maybe they fall in love , " said Suzy.  | " Yeah  --  and that 's the worst that can happen . Know something , Suzy ? When a man falls in love it 's ninety to one he falls for the dame that 's worst for him . That 's why I take matters in my own hands . " " How do you mean ? " Suzy asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself he 's in love with something in himself that has n't got nothing to do with the dame . She looks like his mother , or she 's dark and he 's scared of blondes , or maybe he 's getting even with somebody , or maybe he ai n't quite sure he 's a man and has to prove it . Fella that studied stuff like that told me one time  --  a man do n't fall for a dame . He falls for new roses , and he brings his own new roses . The best marriages are the ones pulled off by someone that 's smart but not sucked in . I think you 'd be good for Doc . " " Why ? " " Because you ai n't like him . You want I should try ? " " No , " said Suzy . " I would n't sandbag no guy . Especially Doc . " " Everybody sandbags everybody , " said Fauna . Suzy said softly , " You know , you was right , Fauna . I was sixteen when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was a girl . I ca n't even remember how it sounds  --  talked to like a girl . " Fauna put her hand on Suzy 's shoulder . " Maybe you 'll find out again , " she said . " If I pull this off I 'll put a red ring around your gold star . You ready to go to sleep now ? " " I guess so , " said Suzy . " Let 's do n't sandbag Doc . " Suzy waited until Fauna had rustled to her bed and then she crept out the front door . The light was still burn/ing in Western Biological . She went across the street , past the street light , and up the stairs , and she tapped with her fingertips . Doc did n't answer . She opened the door and saw him sitting at his table , his eyes red , the glass dishes in front of him . He looked very tired and the skin above his beard was gray . " You 're working late , " she said . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do it over . It takes time . " " I 'm sorry . Doc , you got to write that paper . 1 do n't know nothing about it , but you got to write it . " " I think you were right the first time , " he said . " Maybe I ca n't . " " Sure you can , " said Suzy . " You can do anything you want to . " " Maybe that 's it . Maybe I do n't want to . " " I want you to . " " What have you got to do with it ? " Suzy blushed and looked at her fingers for an answer . " Everybody wants you to , " she said . " You 'll let everybody down if you do n't do it . " He laughed . " That 's not a good reason , Suzy . " She tried another tack . " Everybody hates a coward  --  " " If I 'm a coward , whose business is it ? " " You got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I 'd help you if I could . " " What in the world could you do ? " Her face flamed . " Maybe give you a kick in the ass . Maybe that 's what you need . " " Why ca n't you leave me alone ? " he said . And then ,  | " Goddam it ! You 've done it again  --  you made me pass over the time ! " " You done it yourself , " said Suzy , " you lousy stiff ! You blame everybody else . You done it yourself . " " Get on back to the whorehouse ! " he shouted . " Go on ! Get out ! " In the doorway she stopped and looked back . " God , how I hate a fool ! " she said , and she slammed the door behind her . In a moment there was a tap on the glass . " Go on home ! " Doc shouted . Mack opened the door . " It ai n't Suzy , it 's me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't . Say , Doc , would you say a piece of property on Cannery Row was a good investment ? " " No , " said Doc . " She 's quite a dame , " said Mack . " I thought you said you were n't listening . " " Listen , Doc , nobody in this block was listening  --  but everybody heard . You know , they say there 's three good reasons for marrying a hustler . " " What are you talking about ? " said Doc . Mack counted on his fingers . " Number one , she ai n't likely to wander  --  she 's done all her experimenting . Num .. ber two , you ai n't likely to surprise her or disappoint her . And number three , if a hustler goes for you she ai n't got but one reason . " Doc watched him , hypnotized . " What reason ? " " She likes you . Good night , Doc . " " Sit down  --  have a drink . "  | " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to do tomorrow . ' Night , Doc . " Doc looked at the door after Mack had closed it . The grain of the unpainted pine seemed to squirm to his weary eyes . Looking backward in time , you can usually find the day it started , the day of Sarajevo , the day of Munich , the moment of Stalingrad or Valley Forge . You fix the day and hour by some incident that happened to yourself . You remember exactly what you were doing when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor . There is no doubt that forces were in motion on that Thursday in Cannery Row . Some of the causes and directionshave been in process for generations . There are always some people who claim they felt it coming . Those who remember say it felt like earthquake weather . It was a Thursday , and it was one of those days in Montereywhen the air is washed and polished like a lens , so that you can see the houses in Santa Cruz twenty miles across the bay and you can see the redwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fremont 's Peak , clear the other side of Salinas , stands up nobly against the east . The sunshine had a goldy look and red geraniumsp122burned the air around them . The delphiniums were like little openings in the sky . There are n't many days like that anyplace . People treasurethem . Little kids are likely to give off tin-whistle screams for no reason , and businessmen find it necessary to take a drive to look at a piece of property . Old people sit looking off into the distance and remember inaccurately that the days of their youth were all like that . Horses roll in the green pastures on such a day and hens make a terrible sunny racket . Thursday was that magic kind of day . Miss Winch , who took pride in her foul disposition before noon , said good morning to the postman . Joe Elegant awakened early , intending to work on his novel , on the scene where the young man digs up his grandmother to see if she was as beautiful as he remembered . You will recall his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elegant saw the golden light on the vacant lot and a dew diamond . in the heart of every mallow leaf . He went out in the damp grass in his bare feet and scampered like a kitten until he got to sneezing . Miss Graves , who sings lead in the butterfly pageant in Pacific Grove , saw her first leprechaun up in back of the reservoir  --  but you ca n't tell everything that happened every place on that Sweet Thursday . For Mack and the boys it was the morning of Truth , and since Mack was to bear the brunt of it , his friends cooked him a hot breakfast and Eddie mixed real bourbon whisky in the coffee . Hazel polished Mack 's shoes and brushed his best blue jeans . Whitey No. i brought out his father 's hat for Mack to wear  --  a narrow-brimmed blackp123hat , the crown peaked up to a point . Whitey No. 1 's father had been a switchman on the Southern Pacific , and this hat proved it . He stuffed toilet paper in back of the sweatbanduntil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew how much depended on him , and he was brave and humble at the same time . The boys put the carefully printed tickets in his hand and saw him off , and then they sat down in the weeds to wait . They knew Mack was quaking inside . Mack went down the chicken walk and across the railroadtrack . He passed the old boiler and rapped on the rusty pipes in a wild show of bravado . In front of the grocery he studied a display of screw drivers with loving intensity before he went in . Cacahuete was behind the counter , studying a copy of Down Beat . He wore a purple windbreaker with gold piping . A lean and handsome boy , he had the wild and sullen light of genius in his eyes . " Hi ! " said Mack . " Jar ! " said Cacahuete . " Joseph and Mary around ? " " Upstairs . " " I want to see him personal , " said Mack . Cacahuete gave him a long , surly stare , then went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you want ? " " Mack wants to see you . " " What about ? " " Who knows ? " Joseph and Mary came down the stairs in a pale blue silk bathrobe.  | " ' Morning , Mack . These kids have no manners . " Cacahuete shrugged and took his Down Beat to the top of the potato bin . " You 're out early , " said the Patron . Mack began with ceremonial seriousness , " You ai n't been here long , Joseph and Mary , but you 've made a lot of friends , good friends . " The Patron inspected this statement and made note of its slight inaccuracy . Still , he had nothing to lose by going along with it . " I like the people around here , " he said . " They treat me good . " His eyelids lowered sleepily , which meant he was as alert as a radar screen . Mack said , " In a little town you get kind of hidebound . But you 're a man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things is . " The Patron smiled and acknowledged his wisdom and waited . " I and the boys want to ask your advice , " said Mack . " You ai n't likely to get a wild hair . " A vague uneasiness stirred in the Patron . " What 's it about ? " he asked tentatively . Mack drew a deep breath . " A smart businessman like you might think it was silly , but maybe you been here long enough to get it . It 's a sentimental thing . It 's about Doc . I and the boys owe Doc a debt we ai n't never going to be able to repay . " " How much ? " asked the Patron . He up-ended a broom and tore out a straw with which to pick his teeth . " Take a powder , " he said softly to Cacahuete , and his nephew slithered upstairs. " lt ai n't money , " said Mack , " it 's gratitude . For yearsp125Doc 's took care of us  --  get sick he cures us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everybody says the same , " the Patron observed . He could not put his finger on the attack , and yet he felt there was an attack . The sound of his own voice had a warming , reassuring effect on Mack . He was the professional practicing his profession . " We might of went right on hustling Doc for years , " he said , " if only Doc did n't get his ass in a sling . " " He 's in trouble ? " " You know he 's in trouble , " said Mack . " Poor bastard sits there beating his brains out with them sooplapods . " " You told me . " " Well , us boys want to do something about it . We ai n't going to see our darling friend crap out if we can help it . I bet he done a couple of nice things for you too . " The Patron said , " Do you know you ca n't rig a chess game ? " " We had that out , " said Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ca n't crack open them sooplapods without he gets a great big goddam microscope  --  cost about four hundred bucks . " The Patron said hastily , " If you 're passing the hat I 'll throw in ten bucks . " " Thanks ! " said Mack passionately . " I knew you was a good guy . But that ai n't it . I and the boys want to do it ourself . We do n't want your ten bucks  --  we want your advice . " The Patron went behind the counter , opened the icebox , took out two cans of beer , speared them open , and slid one up the counter to Mack.  | " Thanks , " said Mack , and he beered down his dry mouth and throat . " Haaah ! " he said . " That 's fine . Now here 's what we want to know . We got something and we want to raffle it . Then we want to take that raffle money and get that microscope for Doc . We want you should give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What you going to raffle ? " the Patron asked . This was the moment , the horrible moment . Mack 's hand shook a little as he poured down the second half of the cool sharp beer . His insides quaked . " The Palace Flophouse  --  ourhome , " he said . The Patron took a pocket comb out of stock and ran it through his black shining hair . " It ai n't worth four hundred bucks , " he said . Mack nearly cried with relief . He could have kissed the Patron 's hand . He loved Joseph and Mary . A strong and tender tone issued from his throat . " We know that , " he said , " but it 's our home . Oh , I know it ai n't very valuable , but when you got something that ai n't worth much  --  why , you raffle it , do n't you ? If you got a good cause you can raffle an old pair of socks . " A new respect showed in the Patron 's eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , " Who 's going to win it ? " Mack felt confident now . He knew his man . He was ready to use his knowledge . He said confidentially , " I do n't never try to kid a smart hombre . I could tell you we was going to draw honest but you 'd know that was double malarky . No , we got a idear . " The PatrOn leaned forward . Some of his wariness wasp127lulled . He was still no pushover but he was softened up . " What 's the idear ? " he asked . " Well , we got to have someplace to live , do n't we ? Now this is between I and the boys and you  --  okay ? " " Okay , " said the Patron . " We 'll sell Doc a ticket or maybe just put a ticket in his name , and we 'll rig the raffle so he wins . " " I do n't get it , " said the Patron . " Look ! " said Mack . " Doc gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on habiting in the Palace Flophouse but it 's Doc 's . It 's a sap to his old age  --  a kind of insurance . I and the boys figure that 's the least we can do for him . " " S'pose he sells it ? " said the Patron . " Oh , not Doc ! He would n't put us out in the street . " A smile spread over the Patron 's large handsome face . He could find no fault with it . " I guess I never give you proper credit , " he said . " You 're smart . Maybe we can do some business  --  I mean , later . You got the raffle tickets ? " " We made them up last night . " Mack laid a little pile of cards on the table . " How much apiece ? " " Says right on them , " Mack said . " Two bucks . " " My first offer still stands , " said the Patron . " I 'll take five and you can leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty ? " " I could unload nearly fifty , " said the Patron . " I 'll put them out with the Espaldas Mojadas . " Mack 's knees were weak as he went up the chicken walk . His glazed eyes stared straight ahead . He walked right pastp128the boys and into the Palace Flophouse and sat down heavily on his bed . The boys trooped in behind him and stood around . " Got him ! " said Mack . " He do n't know he owns it . He bought five tickets and he 's going to sell fifty to his wet-backs ! " There is a point of relief and triumph in which words have no place . Eddie went outside , and they could hear his shovel strike the ground . Mack and the boys knew Eddie was digging up a keg . And this was only one of the happenings on that Sweet Thursday . Fauna always drew the shades of her bedroom tight down . Because of the late hours of business , she had to sleep until noon to get her proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a trick on her . The windowshade had a hole in it no bigger than the point of a pin . The playfulsun picked up the doings of Cannery Row , pushed them through the pinhole , turned them upside down , and projectedthem in full color on the wall of Fauna 's bedroom . Wide Ida waddled across the wall upside down , wearing a print dress strewn with red poppies and on her head a black beret . The Pacific Gas &; Electric truck rolled across her wall upside down , its wheels in the air . Mack strodep129toward the grocery head down . And a little later , Doc , weary , feet over his head , walked along the wallpaper carrying a quart of beer that would have spilled if it had not been an illusion . At first Fauna tried to go back to sleep , but she was afraid she might miss something . It was the little colored ghost of upside-down Doc that drew her from her couch . It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And this had happened to Fauna . She was glad when she raised the shade and saw how beautiful was the day . The roof of the Hediondo Cannery where seagulls had perched glowed like a pearl . Fauna brushed her hair severely back and put on a closefittinghat of black sequins . She wore her dark-gray knitted suit and carried gloves . In the kitchen she put six bottles of beer in a paper bag , and then , as an afterthought , she rooted out one of the shrunken monkey heads as a present . When she climbed the stairs of Western Biological and stood at the top , puffing a little , you might have thought she was soliciting for the Red Cross instead of for the Bear Flag . Doc was frying sausages , sprinkling a little chocolate over them . It gave them an odd and oriental flavor , he thought . " You 're up early , " he greeted Fauna . " I figured one quart of beer would n't last long . " " It did n't , " said Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't mind if I do , " said Fauna . For she knew that he who gives to you is in debt to you . " This here 's a monkey head that I picked up in my travels . " " Interesting , " said Doc.  | " You know , there 's some folks think they 're people 's heads , " said Fauna . " Do n't see how they could . See the shape of the eyes and ears ? Look at the nose . " " Oh , some folks do n't look at people very close , " said Fauna . " I 'll have a bottle of beer with you . " The taste of the chocolate sausages intrigued her . " I never tasted nothing like it , " she observed . " Did you ever eat grasshoppers , Doc ? " " Yes , " said Doc . " In Mexico . They 're kind of peppery . " Fauna was not one to beat around bushes . " You must get sick of everybody wanting something from you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sicker if they did n't , " he said . " What can I do for you ? Say , thanks for the cake and the beer last night ! " Fauna asked , " What did you think of the kid ? " " Strange , " said Doc . " Somehow I ca n't see her working at the Bear Flag . " " Neither can I , " said Fauna . " She ai n't no good at it but it looks like I 'm stuck with her . Trouble with Suzy is , she 's got a streak of lady in her and I do n't know how to root it out . " Doc munched his sausages and sipped his beer thoughtfully . " I never thought of it , but that could be a drawback , " he said . " She 's a nice kid , " said Fauna . " I like her fine . But she 's a liability in a business way . " " Why do n't you kick her out ? " " Oh , I ca n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Ip131never had no gift for kicking people out . What I 'd like is if she 'd pick up and go . She got no future as a floozy . " " She threw the book at me , " said Doc . " You see ? " said Fauna . " She 's a character . That ai n't no good in a house . " " She slapped me in the face with a few basic truths , " said Doc . " That 's a quick eye she 's got . " " And a quicker tongue , " said Fauna . " Would you do me a favor ? " " Why , of course , " said Doc . " Anything I can . " " I ca n't go to nobody else , " Fauna went on , " they would n't understand . " " What is it ? " " Doc , " said Fauna , " I knocked around and I seen all kinds . I tell you , if you got a streak of lady in you it spoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Bear Flag . You play the field . I personally think that costs more but I ai n't one to mess in the way people want to live . " " I do n't think I 'm following you , " said Doc . " Okay , I 'll lay out the deck . When you 're making a play for one of them babes , them amateurs , you got to do quite a lot of talking before you make the sack  --  ai n't that right ? " Doc smiled ruefully . " Right , " he said . " Well , do you always mean every word of it ? " Doc pinched his lower lip . " Why  --  why  --  I guess right at the moment I do . " " But afterward ? " " Afterward , if I were to think about it  --  "  | " That 's what I mean , " said Fauna . " So if you happen to tell a little teensy-beensy bit of baloney you do n't blow your brains out . " " You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you want me to do ? " " This kid Suzy 's lousy with new roses . She ai n't a good hustler because of that streak of lady . I do n't know if she 'd make a good lady or not . I want her off my neck . Doc , would it do you any harm to make a play for her ? I mean , like you do with them dames that come in here . " " What good could that possibly do ? " he asked . " Well , maybe I 'm wrong , but the way I figure it , you can use new roses if you want to . If you made a pitch for the kid , like she was a lady , why , she might turn lady on you . " " I still ca n't see what good it would do , " said Doc . " It would get her the hell out of the Bear Flag , " said Fauna . " She would n't want to congregate with no more floozies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You do n't marry them others , do you ? " " No , but  --  " " Take a whang at her , will you , Doc ? " Fauna begged . " Ca n't do you no harm . Why , hell , she might scram out of here and take up typewriting or telephone operating . Will you do that for me , Doc ? " He said , " It does n't seem honest . " Fauna changed her tack . " I was talking to her last night and she said she could n't remember when a guy had treated her like a girl . What harm would that do ? " " Might make her miserable . "  | 3 " Might make her fly the coop . " " Maybe she likes it the way it is . " " She do n't . I tell you she 's a blowed-in-the-glass lady . Look , Doc , you take her out to dinner and I 'll buy the dinner . You do n't have to make no pass . Just be nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " " Think you might do it ? " " I might . " " That 's a good kid if you treat her right . You 'd be doing me a big favor . " " Suppose she wo n't go ? " " She will . I wo n't give her no choice . " Doc looked out the window and a warmth crept through him , and suddenly he felt better than he could remember feeling . " I 'll think about it , " he said . " I 'll throw in three bottles of champagne whenever you say the word , " said Fauna . After lunch Joe Elegant read Fauna his latest chapter . He explained the myth and the symbol . " You see , " he said , " the grandmother stands for guilt . " " Ai n't she dead and buried ? " " Yes . " " That 's a kind of a messy guilt . " " It 's the reality below reality , " said Joe Elegant . " Balls ! " said Fauna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about something real ? " " Maybe you can tell me about the art of writing ? " he said.  | " I sure as hell can , " said Fauna . " There 's this guy , and he makes love to this dame . " " Very original , " said Joe . " When a man says words he believes them , even if he thinks he 's lying . " " For goodness ' sake ! What are you talking about ? " " I bet I get rid of a certain person and put up a new gold star . You want to take that bet ? " " How did Doc like the cake ? " Joe Elegant asked . " He loved it , " said Fauna . And this was the second event of that Sweet Thursday . Fission took place in the Palace Flophouse , and from there a chain reaction flared up in all directions . Cannery Row caught fire . Mack and the boys had the energy and the enthusiasm of plutonium . Only very lazy men could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meetings , the messages carried , the plans and counterplans ! Mack had to make more and more raffle tickets . What started as a kind of gentle blackmail assumed the nature of an outpouringof popular love for Doc . People bought tickets , sold tickets , traded tickets . Emissaries covered the Southern Pacific Depot , the Greyhound Bus Station . Joe Blaikey , the constable , carried tickets in his pocket and canceled parkingp135summonses if the lawbreaker bought a two-dollar chance on the Palace Flophouse . Whitey No. i invaded the foreign and fancy purlieus of Pebble Beach and Carmel and the Highlands . Whitey No. 2 'S method was characteristically direct . The first man to refuse him got a rock through his windshield , and the news traveled . To the boys it had become a crusade . And the winning ticket , of course , with Doe 's name on it , was in a tomato can , buried in the vacant lot . By tacit agreement no one mentioned the raffle to Doc . To Doe 's friends Mack and the boys mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cared ? It was a perfect example of the collective goodness and generosity of a community . But if communities have a group Good Fairy they also have an Imp who works parallel with and sometimes in collaboration with the Good Fairy . Cannery Row 's Imp saw the Good Fairy stirring to life , and he sprang to action . Into the ears of his clients he whispered a few words , and his constituents grinned with evil pleasure and their thoughts went like this : The Patron is a wise guy . He 's a newcomer , nice clothes , makes his money off poor helpless wetbacks because he 's smart . Lee Chong must have sold him the Palace Flophouse and he 's forgot it or he never knew it . Once Doc wins it the Patron wo n't dare make a move . It is such fun to outsmart a smart guy . The Imp of the Row had a good professional time and for once his job seemed almost virtuous . People bought more tickets from the Patron than from anyone else . They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face when he found out . Now ordinarily Mack and the boys would have strung out the ticket sales over weeks , but time was breathing down their necks . If the Patron got his tax bill from the county their plan would blow up in their faces . They had to take a chance with Friday  --  Saturday was the deadline . The boys spread the word that there would be mediumheavyrefreshments at the Palace Flophouse on Saturday night and that contributions of any nature would be welcome . Mack called on Doc the afternoon of Sweet Thursday . " If you ai n't doing anything Saturday night , " he said , " I and the boys are throwing a little wing-ding . R.S.V.P. " " Moi , je respond oui . " " Come again ? " " I 'll be there , " said Doc . Then Mack remembered a mission with which he had been entrusted . " I guess I could squirm it out of you , Doc , like I done once before , " he said , " but I 'll come right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A shudder went through Doc . " Please do n't give me a party , " he begged . " The last one you gave nearly ruined me . " " This has n't got nothing to do with a party  --  it 's a bet , " said Mack . " I stand to win a buck . When is it ? " Mack prodded him . Doc picked the first date that came to him . " July fourth , " he said . " Why , that 's like the Fourth of July ! "  | " A little , " said Doc , and he felt greatly relieved . Later that afternoon Fauna and the girls called formally at the Palace Flophouse in answer to the note Mack had sent asking them to drink a jolt of good stuff . Suzy did not attend . She had been quiet all morning , and then she mooned away on the path that leads along the sea to the lighthouse on Point Pinos . She looked in the tide pools , and she picked a bunch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can . Suzy was restless and unhappy . She felt excitement and nausea at the same time . She wanted to smile and she wanted to cry , and she was scared and happy and hopeless . Doc had asked her to have dinner with him , at Sonny Boy 's on the pier , and Fauna had urged her to go . Suzy 's first reaction had been violent . " I wo n't do it ! " she said . " Sure you 'll go , " said Fauna . " I may have to persuade you with a indoor-ball bat  --  but you 'll go . " " You ca n't make me . " " Want to test that ? Why , I 've wore my brain down to the knuckles , trying to do something nice for you . " " I ai n't got nothing to wear , " said Suzy . " Neither has Doc . If he can go like he does , what right 's a chippy to get grand ? " " But hell , Fauna , he 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a puff because they got nothing else . I'mafraid I 'll turn mean because I do n't know how to be nice . " " Suzy , " said Fauna , " I 'm going to give you a piece ofadvice , and if you wo n't take it , I may just call Joe Blaikeyand get you floated right out of town . Do n't throw thep138first punch ! Wait 'll you 're hit before you put up your dukes . Most of the time they ai n't nobody laid a glove on you . " " Suppose 1 could wear my suit ? It 's got a big spot , " said Suzy . " Ask Joe Elegant to spot-clean it and press it . Tell him t I said so . " And thus it was that Suzy went walking out lighthouse way on Sweet Thursday . The meeting in the Palace was n't really necessary , for word of the raffle had got around and Fauna had bought ten tickets and made each girl buy one . Eddie had borrowed glasses from Wide Ida 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to the meeting too , and she brought two quarts of Pine Canyon whisky . " It do n't cost hardly nothing , " she explained . Formality took hold of the meeting . Agnes and Mabel kept their knees together when they sat down , and Fauna 's look of thunder made Becky snap hers shut so quickly she spilled her drink . " She 's going to be a wallager , " said Mack . " I ca n't wait to see Doc 's face when he wins . " Wide Ida asked , " How you going to explain it to him he wins when he did n't buy no ticket ? " " Why , we 'll say a friend did it and do n't want his name mentioned . I saw Doc a little while ago . He said he 'd sure be here . " Fauna said , " Did you find out when is his birthday ? " " Sure . July fourth . " Fauna exhaled with the sound of escaping gas . " Holyp139apples ! He 's a gone goose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing work out so nice ! " " What 're you talking about ? " said Mack . Fauna 's eyes were misty . " Mack , " she said huskily , " I do n't want to horn in on your party , but why could n't we make it an engagement party too ? " " Who 's engaged ? " " Well , they ai n't yet  --  but they will be . " " Who ? " " Doc and Suzy . It 's right in their horoscopes . " " S'pose they wo n't ? " " They will , " said Fauna . " You can just depend on that  --  they will ! " The little group sat in silence , and then Mack said softly , " Did I say it was going to be a wallager ? This here 's a tom-wallager ! They ai n't been nothing so stupendous since the Second World War ! You sure Doc 'll go for it ? " " You let me take care of that  --  and do n't none of you blab it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiss of Death Kelly , welterweight . I 'll have Doc in the ring . " Eddie asked , " Flow about Suzy ? " " Suzy 's already in the ring , " said Fauna . They parted quietly , but in their breasts a flame of emotion burned . There never was a day like that Sweet Thursday . And it was n't over yet.  |p140At  four-thirty in the afternoon Fauna ordered Suzy to the office bedroom with full field equipment . Suzy dumped her clothes on Fauna 's bed . " That 's a hell of a way to keep wrinkles out , " Fauna observed . She picked up the gray woolen skirt and jacket , laid them out , inspected them for spots , smelled them for cleaning fluid . " Nice piece of goods , " she said . " Community chest , " said Suzy . " I was in the charity ward . " " Well , somebody was n't . " Her eyes noted the brown shoes . She went to the door and yelled , " Joe ! Joe Elegant ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on duty , " he said . " I 'm a thorn in the side of the worker , " said Fauna . " You run up the street to Wildock 's and get new heel taps on these here . Tell them to fix this scuffed place and give them a nice shine . Wait and bring them back . " Joe complained as he went , but he went . Fauna said to Suzy , " You got any gloves ? " " No . " " I 'll lend you some . Here  --  these white ones . And here 's a handkerchief . I do n't want no lipstick marks on it . Now you listen to me , Suzy girl  --  take care of your shoes , wear clean gloves , carry a white handkerchief , and keep yourp141stocking seams straight . If you do that you can get away with murder . This here 's a nice suit  --  the kind of cloth that the older it gets the better it looks  --  if your heels ai n't run over . Call Becky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't you got a white pique dickey and cuffs ? " " I just done them up . " " I want you should lend them to Suzy . Get some thread and sew the cuffs in this here jacket . " " She 'll have to wash them . " " She will . " While Becky basted in the cuffs Fauna said , " Turn out your purse , Suzy . " She inspected the pile on the bed . " You do n't need that aspirin . Here , take my comb  --  throw that one away . Ai n't nothing tackier than a comb missing teeth . Put these here Kleenex in . Here , use my compact and touch up the shine on your nose once in a while . Let 's see your nails ! Hmmm , pretty good . You washed your hair ? " " Get her a wig , " said Becky , and she bit the thread . " Do n't get smart . Come on now  --  get off your behind and do something with her hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Becky got a light hand with hair . You ca n't take that coat . Community chest slipped up there . " She tapped her teeth with a pencil and then went to her closet and brought out two baum martens that were biting each other 's heads off . " Just hang these here bo ' martens over your shoulder , " Fauna said . " And if you lose them or hurt them I 'll cut your tripes out . Now , where are we ? No perfume . Douse some of this Florida water on  --  kind of old-fashioned and young-smelling. "  |p142Becky  stood behind Suzy 's chair , brushing and combing and molding . " She got big ears , " Becky said . " Maybe I can kind of hide them a little . " " You got a nice hand with hair , " Fauna said . Tide final briefing took place at six o'clock , with the bedroom door closed . " Turn around , " said Fauna . " Keep your ankles close together . Now , walk ! That 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , you 're a good-looking kid if you work at it a little . " Suzy looked at herself in the mirror and she smiled , for it seemed to her that she really was pretty , and the idea startled her and pleased her too , and when she looked pleased she was even prettier . Then her mouth turned down and blind panic came over her . " What 's the matter ? " Fauna demanded . " What can I talk about ? Fauna , I do n't want to go ! I do n't belong with a guy like Doc . Jesus , Fauna , tell him I 'm sick . I ai n't going . " Fauna let her talk herself out and then she said quietly , " Maybe you 'd like to cry now and get your eyes red after all my trouble ? Go on , cry ! " " I 'm sorry , " said Suzy . " You been nice . I ai n't no good , Fauna . You 're just wasting your time . I know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand I 'll get mad . I 'm scared . " " ' Course you 're scared , " said Fauna . " But if you did n't care nothing about Doc you would n't be scared . You did n't invent it . There ai n't never been no dame went out first time with a guy she liked that was n't scared . Maybe Doc 's scared too . "  | " Oh nuts ! " said Suzy . Fauna said , " If I was your age with your face and shape and what I know , there would n't be no man in the world could get away ! I got the know-how  --  but that 's all I got . Oh well ! I 'm going to tell you a few thousand things , Suzy , that if you would listen you 'd get anything you want . But hell , you wo n't listen ! Nobody listens , and when they learn the hard way it 's too late . Maybe it 's a good thing  --  I do n't know . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't learn . You know , Suzy , they ai n't no way in the world to get in trouble by keeping your mouth shut . You look back at every mess you ever got in and you 'll find your tongue started it . " " That 's true , " said Suzy . " But I ca n't seem to stop . " " You got to learn it like you learn anything else  --  just practice . Next thing is opinions . You and me is always busting out with opinions . Hell , Suzy , we ai n't got no opinions ! We just say stuff we heard or seen in the movies . We 're scared we 'll miss something , like running for a bus . That 's the second rule : lay off opinions because you ai n't really got any . " " You got them numbered , huh ? " said Suzy . " I should write a book , " said Fauna . " If She Could , I Could . ' Now take number three . There do n't hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to do nothing when you listen . If you do listen it 's pretty interesting . If a guy says something that pricks up your interest , why , do n't hide it from him . Kind of try to wonder what he 's thinking instead of how you 're going to answer him back . " " You 're sure putting the finger on me , " Suzy said softly  | " I only got a little more , but it 's the hardest of all , and the easiest . " " What number ? " " I lost track . Do n't pretend to be something you ai n't , and do n't make like you know something you do n't , or sooner or later you 'll sure fall on your ass . And there 's one more part to this one , whatever number it is : they ai n't nobody was ever insulted by a question . S'pose Doc says something and you do n't know what it means . Ask him ! The nicest thing in the world you can do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , looking down at her hands . Fauna said , " You got nice nails . Flow do you keep them so nice ? " Suzy said , " That 's easy . My grandma taught me . You keep a old lemon rind , and every time you wash your hands you scrounge your fingernails around in it . And then you shake a little face powder on your hand and you polish your nails on the ham of your hand and you push down the quick with a little piece of lemon wood . " " See what I mean ? " said Fauna . " What ? " " I just asked you a question . " Suzy blushed . " I sure fell into that . " " No , you did n't . I wanted to know . It 's best if you ask when you want to know . " " Thanks , " said Suzy . " You 're a hell of a dame . I wonder if I could learn ? " " You can if you just remember a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzy and you ai n't nobody else but Suzy . Then you got to remember that Suzy is a goodp145thing  --  a real valuable thing  --  and there ai n't nothing like it in the world . It do n't do no harm just to say that to yourself . Then , when you got that , remember that there 's one hell of a lot Suzy do n't know . Only way she can find out is if she sees it , or reads it , or asks it . Most people do n't look at nothing but themselves , and that 's a rat race . " " What 's the fourth thing ? " Suzy asked . " I 'm proud of you ! " Fauna said . " You listened . The next thing you 'll have to do some thinking about . Nobody do n't give a particular damn about Suzy one way or the other . It 's hard to get them thinking about you because they 're too busy thinking about themselves . There 's two , three , copper-bottom ways to get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice or good or pretty , tell them . Do n't make it a fake though . Do n't fight nobody unless there ai n't no other way . Do n't never start a fight , and if one starts , let it get going good before you jump in . Best way in the whole world to defend yourself is to keep your dukes down ! Now , when you got their attention , first thing they want is to do something . That 's a slap in the puss . Thing people like most in the world is to give you something and have you like it and need it . That ai n't sloppy . That works . You give it a try . " " You think Doc would fall for that stuff ? " " Just give it a try . " Suzy said , " Fauna , did n't you never get married ? " " No . " " Why not ? " Fauna smiled . " Time I learned what I just told you , it was too late . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see ! You got me softened up like butter . I want you should keep them furs . " " But  --  " " Watch it ! " " Yeah , I see . I sure do thank you . And would you maybewrite down all that stuff so I can get it by heart ? " " Sure I will . Now look , Suzy  --  tonight , just before yousay something , say it first to yourself , and kind of dust it off . " " You mean cussing ? " " I mean cussing and 1 mean  --  well , sometimes if you look at it you do n't say it . One whole hell of a lot that passes for talk is just running off at the mouth . I guess you 're about ready now . " " Is there anything I can do for you , Fauna ? " " Yes . I want you should repeat after me , I 'm Suzy and nobody else . ' " " I 'm Suzy and nobody else . ' " " I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . ' " " There ai n't nothing like me in the whole world . ' " " There ai n't nothing '  --  goddam it , Fauna , now my eyes ' 11 be red ! " " They look pretty that way , " said Fauna . At seven o'clock Doc , dressed in an open-collared shirt , leather jacket , and army pants , rang the bell at the Bear Flag . He looked at Suzy and he said , " I 've got to make a telephone call , do you mind ? " And he ran back to the laboratory.  |p147Ten  minutes later he returned . He had on clean slacks , a tweed jacket , and a tie he had n't used in years . Fauna saw him standing under the porch light . " Honey , " she said to Suzy , " you win the first round on points . " Sonny Boy is truly the only Greek born in America named Sonny Boy . He operates a restaurant and bar on the wharf in Monterey . Sonny Boy is plump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco and went to public schools , Sonny Boy has singlehandedly O kept alive the mystery of the Near East . His perfectly round face hints Orient Express and beautiful spies . His bushy voice is congenitally confidential . Sonny Boy can say " good evening " and make it sound like an international plot . His restaurant makes friends for him and supports him . Perhaps Sonny Boy , in one sense , wears a long black cape and dines with Balkan countesses where two seas kiss the Golden Horn  --  but he also runs a good restaurant . He probably knows more secrets than any man in the community , for his martinis are a combination truth serum and lie detector . Veritas is not only in vino but regularly batters its way out . Doc stopped his old car in front of Sonny Boy 's , got out ,  |p148walked  around , opened the other door , and helped Suzy out . She was a little shocked but she remained silent . The sentence , " You think I 'm a cripple , for Chrissake ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's advice  --  whispered it and pushed it back . The fact of his hand on her elbow did a magic thing to her , pushed back her shoulders and raised her chin . The gritty light of resistance went out of her eyes . Doc opened the door of the bar and stood aside to let Suzy enter . The regulars on the stools turned to look . The eyes crept from pretty face to pretty legs , took in the martens on the way . For one second panic halted her , but she saw no look of recognition in the eyes of the regulars . Sonny Boy turned sideways to get around the end of the bar . " ' Evening , folks , " he said . " Your table is ready . Would you like to have a cocktail here , or shall I send one over ? " " Oh , let 's sit at the table , " said Doc . Sonny Boy bowed Suzy through the door to the restaurant , and she strolled ahead with her nice walk . Sonny Boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Your secretary called . It 's all fixed . You got a secretary , Doc ? " Doc overcame his surprise . " Part time , " he said . " Who 's the lady ? She new around here ? " " She 's new around here , " said Doc . He caught up with Suzy . " This way , " said Sonny Boy . He led them to a round table in front of the stone fireplace . A pine fire crackled and sent out its fragrance . The table had a centerpiece ofp149wild iris . The breadsticks stood like soldiers in their glasses . The napkins were folded to make little crowns . It was the best table in the house , private , but downstage and well lighted . Suzy 's eyes darted around the room . No other table had flowers . Something wonderful happened in Suzy . She did n't walk around the table and sit down . She waited , and when Doc held her chair she seated herself , looked smiling up at him , and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good you telephoned , " he said . " I had trouble getting pompano , but I got it . How 's about a cocktail ? The wine 's cooling . " Doc said , " One time I had some kind of  --  " " I remember ! " said Sonny Boy . " The Webster F. Street Lay-Away Plan  --  a martini made with chartreuse instead of vermouth . Very good . " " Very effective , as I remember it , " said Doc . " Two doubles . " " Coming right up , " said Sonny Boy . " I told Tony to be here to play piano like you said , but he 's sick . " Doc looked at Suzy to see whether she knew Fauna had made the arrangements . She did n't . It is probable that if Doc had n't ordered the Webster F. Street Lay-Away Plans he would have got them anyway . They arrived with a speed that indicated they were already mixed . The shock of a necktie was leaving Doc . He looked across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beauty in a girl that it can come and go ? This Suzy did not faintly resemble the tough hustler who had screamed at him the night before . He raised the cocktail glass . " You'rep150pretty , " he said . " I 'm glad you came with me . Here 's to both of us . " Suzy swallowed a gulp , held back her tears , and waited for the spasm to pass . " I should have warned you , " said Doc , " there 's a rumor that this drink is made of rattlesnake venom and raw opium . " Suzy got her breath . " It 's good , " she said . " But I was watching its right hand and walked into a left hook ! " Her mind cried , I should n't of said that ! I forgot already . Then she saw Doc 's amusement and it was all right . Suzy noticed a waiter drifting delicately within earshot . She had discovered something for herself . When in doubt , move slowly . Her head turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her **34;7656;TOOLONG . She lifted her glass slowly , looked at it carefully , then sipped and held it a moment before she put it down . S-1-o-w-ness  --  it gave meaning to everything . It made everything royal . She remembered how all the unsure and worried people she knew jumped and picked and jittered . Just doing everything slowly , forcingherself , she felt a new kind of security . Do n't forget , she told herself . Do n't ever forget this . Slow ! Slow ! Doc gave her a cigarette and held a match , and she leaned forward so slowly that the flame was touching his fingers before she had lighted it . A lovely warmth stole through . her body . She felt bold , not defensively bold , but safe . She asked , " Do they know  --  what I am ? " The Lay-Away Plan works equally on all . Doc said , " They know you 're with me . That 's all they need to know . Shall we have one more ? "  | 51It came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conspiracy , Sonny Boy wanted to be in on it . If felicity , he liked that too . " I like a fire , " Suzy said . " Once we had a fireplace where I lived . " Doc said , " You 're pretty . Yes , by George ! You 're pretty ! " Suzy swallowed the first words that rose and swallowed the second ones and ended up by dropping her eyes and saying " Thank you " softly . Sonny Boy personally escorted the waiter , who carried the ice bucket with the chilled Chablis . Then he stood back and surveyed the table . " How is everything , Doc ? " " Just fine , " said Doc . " You ready to eat ? " " Any time , " said Doc . And Suzy 's discovery continued to hold good : Take it slow and keep your eyes open and your mouth shut . The cold , cracked crab , the pompano , were new to her , and they required an eating technique she did n't know . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't conscious that she watched every move he made . When champagne and fruit and cheese arrived , Suzy knew she had to be alone . A thought so overwhelming had come to her that her knees shook and the blood pounded in her temples . Slow ! she warned herself . Take it easy . She looked at the leaping flames and then pivoted her head to Doc . " Will you excuse . . . ? " " Of course ! " He jumped up and drew back her chair . Suzy moved regally toward the Ladies ' Room . She could not feel her feet against the floor.  |p152Doc  watched her passage . Strange , strange , he thought . What is it ? " Maidenly " is the word . A kind of lonely and terrible modesty . What has made the change ? Then he thought , It 's an act . Fauna coached her . But he knew that was n't true . Acting could n't get into the eyes like that . Coaching could n't draw the blood to her cheeks . He spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself wishing she would hurry back . His eyes found a window that reflected the door to the Ladies ' Room . Behind that door Suzy dampened a paper towel and put it against her forehead . She stared at herself in the mirror and she did n't know the face . She thought of the dinner . " I hate fish , " she said out loud . " It makes me break out . But I ai n't broke out . " Finally she was ready to inspect the thought that had sent her out : the symbol , the mystery , the signpost with an inexorable pointing finger . It was so plain no one could miss it . Fate was not only pointing the way but booting from behind . She thought of the dishes being taken away : the heaped legs and claws of crab and  --  They had eaten their horoscopes ! Cancer and Pisces  --  fish and crab . " Great God Almighty ! " she said , and she was limp in the hands of Fate . Sonny Boy came to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Doc . " Just like you ordered . " " Huh ? " " Y our secretary told me . " " Fine , " said Doc , " just the way I wanted it . "  | 3When Suzy came back she was dedicated . You can only fight Fate so far , and when you give in to it you 're very strong ; because all of your force flows in one direction . Doc held her chair and then he popped the champagne cork and smelled it . Suzy said , " Can I have it ? " " Of course . " She turned the cork in her fingers and looked at it . It was very beautiful . She put it in her purse and took an iris from the vase . " Do you like champagne ? " " I love it , " she said and wondered what it would taste like . And she did love it . Doc said , " You know , out in the sand dunes there are little valleys covered with pines . Sometime , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and cook our supper . It 's very nice . " " The fire reminded you , " said Suzy . " That 's clever of you  --  so it did . " She said , " Doc , will you sometime teach me about the stuff you got in your place ? " " Sure I will . " A surge of affection filled him . But he was a little afraid too of her terrible modesty . He looked away from her eyes to the wild iris in her hand . " There 's an old Welsh story , " he said . " It 's about a poor knight who made a wife completely out of flowers  --  " The wine was strong in Suzy now . She said the sentence twice to herself before she said it aloud to Doc . " I hope she did n't wilt . " The low voice of Doc 's guts burst through at last . " I'mp154lonely , " he said . He said it as a simple matter of fact and he said it in wonder . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . " He felt very shy . He filled the glasses . " What the hell ! Let 's have some brandy too . " Suzy turned half away from him so that her face was outlined in leaping pine flames . " You know that place you said  --  out in the sand dunes ? " " Yes . " " Could we look at it ? " " Whenever you want . " " On our way home ? " " You 'll ruin your shoes . " " I know , " said Suzy . " You could take them off . " " I will , " said Suzy . Not everyone believes that Friday is unlucky , but nearly everybody agrees it is a waiting day . In business , the week is really over . In school , Friday is the half-open gate to freedom . Friday is neither a holiday nor a workday , but a time of wondering what Saturday will bring . Trade and amusement fall off . Women look through their closets to see what they have to wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabs for supper at the Bear Flag . The Espaldas Mojadas returned from their latest triumph and were ushered with great courtesy to the rooms over the grocery . The Patron distributed bottles of tequila . Also , he kept a saucer of Seconal at hand . Sometimes a passion of homesickness got into his wetbacks . Sleep , he thought , was better than fighting . Doc slept late , and when he went to the grocery for his morning beer he found Joseph and Mary alert and gay , and the sound of singing drifted down the stairs . " Have a good time ? " the Patron asked . " What do you mean ? " Doc demanded . " Did n't you have a nice party last night ? " " Oh sure , " said Doc . He said it with finality . " Doc , I 'd like you to teach me more of that chess . " " You still think you can cheat at it , do you ? " " No , I just like to figure it out . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Wonderful ! " said Doc . " That 's the best beer in the Western Hemisphere . " " It 's a present , " said the Patron . " Why ? " " I do n't know . Maybe I just feel good . " " Thanks , " said Doc . He began to feel uneasy . There were eyes on him . Going back to Western Biological , he felt eyes on him . It 's the brandy , he thought . I should n't drink brandy . Makes me nervous . He scrambled two eggs and shook curry powder over them . He consulted the tide chart in Thursday 's Monterey Herald . There was a fair tide at 2:18 p.m. , enough for chitons and brittlestars if the wind was n't blowing inshorep156by then . The Bohemia beer settled his nerves without solvinghis restlessness . And for once the curried eggs did n't taste very good . Fauna knocked and entered . She flicked her hand at the rattlesnakes . " How do you feel , Doc ?

And then , " I said good morn-ing . " " Oh yeah , " said Suzy . " ' Morning . " " Look at me ! " " Why not ? " Suzy raised her eyes . " You can look down now , " said Fauna . " You do n't know nothing , " said Suzy . " Okay , I do n't know nothing . When did I ever get nosy with you ? Joe , " she called , " bring me a cup of coffee ! " She slid a tin box of aspirins across the oil-cloth tablecover . " Thanks . " Suzy took three and washed them down with coffee . " He 's going out collecting bugs , " said Fauna quietly . " You went over there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice time ? " Suzy looked up at her with eyes so wide that she seemed to be turned inside out . " He did n't make no pass , " she said breathlessly . " Went out on the sand dunes and he did n't make no pass . " Fauna smiled . " But he talked nice ? " " Did n't talk much , but he talked nice . " " That 's good . " " Maybe I 'm nuts , Fauna , but I told him . " " Oh , you ai n't nuts . " " I told him everything . He did n't even ask . " Fauna asked quietly , " What did he talk about ? " " He said there 's a fella in old times made a wife out of flowers . "  | " What for , for God 's sake ? " " Well , I do n't know . But it was all right when he said it. , , " What else did he say ? " Suzy spoke slowly . " Out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he give me a boost every now and then when I run down .

" " Remember what you said , how I 'm fish and he 's crab ? " Fauna turned her head away . " I got something up my nose , " she said . " I wonder if I 'm catching cold . " " Do you think that 's a sign , Fauna ? Do you ? " " Everything 's signs , " said Fauna . " Everything . " There was a glory in Suzy 's eyes . " Right after we ate wewas talking , and he said , I 'm lonely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fauna said . " That 's a dirty trick ! " " No , ma'am , " Suzy contradicted her . " He did n't say it like that . I heard that one before too . He said it like it was pushed out of him . It surprised him , like he did n't know he was going to say it . What do you think , Fauna ? Tell me , what do you think ? " " I think there 's going to be like a new gold star . " " Well , s'pose  --  and there ai n't no harm in supposings'poseI moved over there . It would be  --  well , it would bep159right across the street from here . Everybody knows I worked here . Would n't that kind of bother him ? " " He knows you work here , do n't he ? Suzy girl , you got to promise me something . Do n't you never try to run away from nothing , because you ca n't . If you 're all right nobody ai n't going to tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a fugitive . And a fugitive never gets away . " " How about Doc ? " said Suzy . " Look , if you ai n't good enough for him , he ai n't good for you . " " I do n't want to lay no bear trap for him , Fauna . " Fauna was smiling to herself . She said , " I guess a man is the only kind of varmint sets his own trap , baits it , and then steps in it . You just set still , Suzy girl . Do n't do nothing . Nobody ca n't say you trapped him if you do n't do nothing . " " Well , he did n't really say  --  " " They never do , " said Fauna . Suzy said weakly , " I ca n't hardly breathe . " " You know , you ai n't cussed once this morning , " Fauna said . " Ai n't I ? " " Some of my gold stars was damn good hookers , " said Fauna . " But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoringbusiness ai n't lost nothing . Like the Patron says , you 're too small in the butt and too big in the bust . " " I do n't want nobody to get the idea I 'm hustling Doc . " " You 're damn right you ai n't . I 'll see to that . " She looked speculatively at Suzy . " You know , I 'd like you to get out of town tonight and kind of freshen up . " " Where 'll I go ? "  | " You could go on an errand for me to San Francisco if you wanted to . I got a little package up there in a safedepositbox . I 'll give you some dough . And I want you should buy some clothes and a hat . Get a nice suit . It 'll last you for years . Look ! Walk up and down Montgomery Street and see what the nice-looking dames is wearing  --  you know , the kind of material . They 're pretty smart women up there . Before you buy , look around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . " Suzy said , " You getting me out of the way ? " " Yeah , " said Fauna . " You got the idea . " " Why ? " " Suzy girl , that ai n't none of your business . There 's a two o'clock bus and a four o'clock bus . " " I 'll take the four o'clock . " " Why ? " " Well , you said Doc 's going out collecting bugs . Maybe while he 's gone I could kind of swamp out his joint . It ai n't had a scrubbing for years . " " That might make him mad . " " I 'll start him a nice stew cooking slow , " said Suzy . " I make a real nice stew . " She came around the table . " Get your hands off me ! " said Fauna . " Go on now ! And do n't you ever say that thing again that made a sucker out of me . My best fur ! " " You mean , I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say it . " " Okay , " said Suzy.  |p161Doc  got back from his collecting about four-thirty . He had over a hundred chitons bound with string to little glass plates to keep them from curling , and submerged in sea water in his collecting buckets were hundreds of brittlestars . Now , killing is one of the delicate operations of a marine zoologist . You want the animal to resemble its living self , but this is impossible . In death the color changes , just as it does with us . Also , if any violent means of killing is used there is constriction , and in the case of brittlestars the death struggle causes the animal to shed its arms . In the front room of Western Biological , Doc poured out part of the sea water from his wooden bucket . Then he moved the brittlestars to a large , flat-bottomed glass dish and poured some sea water on top of them . The little animalswith the snakelike arms whipped about for a moment and then settled down . When they were quite still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The arms stirred nervously . He waited a while and then added a little more fresh water . To a sea animal , fresh water is a poison , and if it is slowly introduced it is as subtle as morphine . It relaxes and soothes until the little creature goes to sleep and dies without violence . Doc sat down to wait for the poison to act . He sensedp162that there was something wrong . What could it be ? Had he forgotten something ? He felt all right , the small hangover of the morning was gone . Of course ! It was the case of Bohemia beer over at the Patron 's . His subconscious must have been reminding him of the beer . He looked out the window toward the grocery . And there was something wrong with that too . And finally he saw . His windows were clean . He turned and looked around the laboratory . The records were piled neatly on the shelves , not falling all over themselves . The floor was shining , and that smell  --  that was soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean , the pans scoured and shining . A delicious odor came from a pot on the gas stove . He lifted the lid . Brown meat juice bubbled up through carrots and onions , and a stick of white celery swam like a fish . Doc went back to his table and sat down . His cot was made up and smooth and the turned-down sheet was clean . Suddenly a sense of desolation came over him  --  a great sadnessthat was like warmth . The toes of his lined-up shoes peaked out at him from under the bed . The poor kid , he thought . Oh , the poor damn kid ! I wonder if she 's trying to repay  --  I hope I have n't done anythingbad . My God , I hope she did n't misunderstand anything ! What did 1 say ? I know I did n't do anything , but what did I say ? I would n't hurt Suzy for the world . He glanced around again . She sure does a job of cleaning , he thought . The stew smells wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass dish . The arms of the brittlestars were arranging themselves in small spirals . They hardly moved when the fresh poison was introduced.  |p163The  clean laboratory made Doc nervous and apprehensive . And there was something missing from himself , somethinglost . The lowest voice of all was still . In his black depths he was somehow comforted . He went to the record shelf : not Bach . . . no , not Buxtehude . . . not Palestrinaeither . His hand strayed to an album not used in a long time . He had opened it before he knew what he was doing . And then he smiled and put the first record on the turntable : Mozart 's Don Giovanni . It started its overture , and Doc , still smiling , went to the kitchen and stirred the stew . " Don Giovanni , " he said . " Is that what I think of myself ? No ! I do not . But why do I feel so good , and so bad ? " He looked at his desk . The yellow pads were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe I 'll try . " And at that point there were fumbling steps on his porch and Old Jingleballicks burst in . It is madness to write about Old Jingleballicks , but since he came in at this point it is necessary . People coming out of a session with Old Jay felt slightly dizzy , and the wise ones , after a time , just did n't believe it . His name can not be mentioned , for it occurs on too many bronze plaques that begin , " Donated by . " Old Jay was born so rich that he did n't know he was rich at all . He thought everybody was that way . He was a scientist , but whether brilliant or a screwball nobody ever knew , and since he had contributed to so many learned foundations and financed so many projects and served on so many boards of trustees , nobody dared openly to wonder . He gave millions away but he was likely to sponge on a friend . His scholastic honors were many , and there were people who thought privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he was , in fact , like a football player whose grades have little relation to his scholarship . He was a stubby man with a natural tonsure of yellow hair . His eyes were bright as a bird 's eyes , and he was interested in everything . He was so close to reality that he had completely lost touch with realism . Sometimes he amused Doc , and at other times his endless and myopic enthusiasms could drive a man to despair . Old Jingleballicks shouted at everyone under the impression that this made for clarity . " Did you get my wire ? " he cried . " No . " " Came for your birthday . Always remember it . Same day they burned Giordano Bruno . " " It 's not my birthday , " said Doc . " Well , what day is this ? " " Friday . " " Oh ! Well , 1 ' 11 wait over . " " It 's in December . I only have one cot . " " All right . I 'll sleep on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lid off the pot , and began eating the stew  --  blowing on it violently to cool it . " That 's not done , " said Doc , and he was irritated to find that he was shouting back . " Done enough ! " cried Old Jay and went on eating . Doc said , " Hitzler came through . He said you were seen on a lawn in Berkeley , on your knees , pulling a worm out of the ground with your teeth . " Old Jay swallowed a half-cooked carrot . " Not so ! " he shouted . " Say , this stew 's not done . "  | " That 's what I told you . " " Oh ! Well , you see I 've watched robins getting warms . Little beggars dig in their heels , so to speak . I got to wonderinghow much actual pull was involved . Had a scale with a clamp in my teeth . Average night crawler resists to the extent of one pound six ounces . I tried forty-eight individuals . Think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own weight . No wonder they eat so much . Just eating keeps them hungry . Like robins ? " " Not particularly , " said Doc . " Are you going to eat all my dinner ? " " I guess so , " said Old Jingleballicks . " But it 's not done . You got anything to drink ? " " I 'll get some beer , " said Doc . " Fine ! Get a lot . " " Do n't you want to contribute a little ? " " I 'm short , " said Old Jay . Doc said , " You are not . You 're a free-loader . " " Oh ! " said Jingleballicks . " I said , do n't you want to contribute ! " " I 'm a little short , " said Old Jay . Doc said angrily , " You are not . You 're a free-loader . You never pay . You ran the lab while I was in the Army and damn near bankrupted me . I do n't say you stole most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you take those specimen jars ? " " Well , yes , " said Old Jingleballicks . And then he said thoughtfully , " I wish you were a charity or an institution . " " What ! " " Then I could endow you , " said Old Jingleballicks.  | " Well , I 'm not an institution . So what do you do ? You go to a lot of trouble to keep from paying a couple of dollars for beer . " And suddenly despair and humor crashed head on in Doc and he burst into weary laughter . " Oh Lord , " he said , " you 're just not possible ! You 're a ridiculousidea . " " Your stew is burning , " said Old Jingleballicks . Doc leaped to the stove and pulled the pot from the burner . " You ate all the juice , " he said bitterly . " Of course it burned ! " " It was very good , " said Old Jay . In the grocery Doc said , " Give me a dozen cans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hell no ! " Doc said . " I have a guest who  --  " And then an evil thought came to him . " A very interesting man , " Doc said . " Why do n't you come over and have a drink with us ? Old  --  I mean , my friend can explain chess to you better than I can . " " Why not ? " said the Patron . " Maybe I better bring a little liquor . " " Why not ? " said Doc . Crossing the street , the Patron asked , " You going to the party tomorrow ? " " Sure . " " I like you , Doc , but I do n't get you . You ai n't real , " said the Patron . " How do you mean ? " " Well , everything you do is  --  well , you 're like that chess . I do n't get you at all . " Doc said , " Do you suppose nobody 's real to anybodyp167else ? You 're going to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't talk like that , " said the Patron nervously . Old Jay shouted as they went up the stairs , " I bring you tidings of great joy . The human species is going to dis-appear ! " " This is Joseph and Mary Rivas , " said Doc . " Joseph and Mary , this is Old Jingleballicks . " " Why ca n't you rig a chess game ? " the Patron asked . " Oh , you can , you can ! Or at least you can rearrange your opponent . Comes to the same thing . Now , where was I ? Oh yes  --  we are about to join the great reptiles in ex-tinction . " " Good ! " said Doc . " You mean there ai n't gon na be no more people ? " said the Patron . " Right , young man . We have played the final joke on ourselves . Open the beer ! Man , in saving himself , has destroyedhimself . " " Who 's destroyed ? " the Patron demanded . " There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We go not to Armageddon but to the gas chamber , and we generate our own gas  --  " Doc said , " I intended to work on my paper . " " Good ! I 'll help , " said Old Jingleballicks . " Oh God ! No ! " said Doc . " Man has solved his problems , " Old Jay went on . " Predatorshe has removed from the earth ; heat and cold he has turned aside ; communicable disease he has practically eliminated . The old live on , the young do not die . The best wars ca n't even balance the birth rate . There was a time when a small army could cut a population in half in a year.  |p168Starvation  , typhus , plague , tuberculosis , were trusty weapons . A scratch with a spear point meant infection and death . Do you know what the incidence of death from battle wounds is today ? One per cent . A hundred years ago it was eighty per cent . The population grows and the productivityof the earth decreases . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . Only birth controlcould save us , and that is one thing mankind is never going to practice . " " Broth-er ! " said the Patron . " What makes you so damn happy about it ? " " It is a cosmic joke . Preoccupation with survival has set the stage for extinction . " " I did n't get one goddam word of that , " said Joseph and Mary . Doc 's hands were full . In his left he held a small glass of whisky and in his right a can of beer . He sipped from the one and gulped from the other . " Every instinct tells me to stay out of this , " he said , " and every impulse makes me want to get into it . " " Good ! " said Old Jay . " Is that whisky ? " " Old Tennis Shoes , " said Joseph and Mary . " Want some ? " " Perhaps a little later . " " Okay " " It 's a little later now , " said Old Jingleballicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Patron . " I got a feeling I 'm being took . " " Well , the impulse wins , " said Doc . " You have forgotten one thing , Old Jingleballicks . Indeed , there have been specieswhich became extinct through their own miscalcula/tions , but they were species with a small range of variability . Now consider the lemming  --  " " That is a very specialized case , " said Old Jingleballicks . " How do you know we are n't ? What do lemmings do when their population exceeds the food supply ? ' Whole masses of them swim out to sea and drown , until a balance of food and population is reached . " " I deny your right to use lemmings , " said Old Jingleballicks . " Hand me the bottle , will you ? " " Deny and be damned ! " Doc said . " Is the lemming migrationa disease ? Is it a memory ? Or is it a psychic manifestationforced on part of the group for the survival of the whole ? " Old Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbed of extinction ! This is a swindle . " He turned to the Patron . " Do n't listen to that man . He 's a charlatan . " " He sure in hell is , " said Joseph and Mary admiringly . Doc leveled a finger between the eyes of Old Jay , holding his whisky glass like the butt of a pistol . " Disease , you say ? Infection ? Down almost to nonexistence ? But tell me , are not neurotic disturbances on the increase ? And are they curable or does the cure spread them ? Now you wait ! Do n't you try to talk now . Do you suppose that the tendencytoward homosexuality might not also have a mathematicalprogression ? And could this not be the human so-lution ? " " You ca n't prove it , " Old Jingleballicks cried . " It 's all talk  --  overemphasis . Why , you might as well accuse me of neurotic tendencies and be done with it ! " His eyes brimmed with tears . " My friend , my thought-friend , my true friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even think of such a thing . " " You would n't ? " " Certainly not . " " When are you going to start dinner ? " said Old Jingleballicks . " You 've eaten my dinner , " said Doc . " I 've got a fine idea , " said Old Jay . " While you start dinner , William and Mary can get a fresh bottle of whisky and I 'll set up the chessmen . " " It 's not William and Mary , it 's Joseph and Mary . " " Who is ? Oh ! My friend , I 'm going to teach you the greatest of all games , the ethereal creation of human intelligence . Shall we sugar it up with a little side bet ? " " Why , you dishonest old fraud ! " Doc shouted . " Ten dollars , Mary ? " The Patron shrugged his shoulders in apology to Doc . " You have to pay to learn things , " he said . " Make it twenty-five , " Old Jingleballicks said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of salmon and a can of spaghetti and stirred the two together in a frying pan . He grated nutmeg over it . Sadly he put the burned stewpot to soak in the sink . A little after dark the Patron went back to the grocery and sent Cacahuete to deliver a third bottle of whisky . Upstairshe joined the wetbacks as in advancing and retreating lines they danced the sad and stately measures of the Tehuanos . " Sandunga , " they sang , " Sandunga mama mia . . . " In the darkening laboratory Doc and Old Jay went softly into the third bottle of Old Tennis Shoes.  | " You 've had the bed long enough , " Doc said . " I want it now. , , " All right . As I grow older I expect less and less  --  and get nothing , even from my so-called friends . " " Look here ! You 've eaten and spoiled my first dinner , stuffed my second , swilled my beer , taken two drinks for one of the whisky , appropriated my bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my fountain pen in your pocket . And how you razzle-dazzled the Patron out of twenty-five dollars I do n't know . You should n't have told him that under certain circumstances a knight can jump three squares in one direction  --  that 's not honest . " " I know , " said Old Jingleballicks . He patted the pillow lovingly . " Now you lie down here and get comfortable . I 'll bring you a drink . Feel better now ? " " Oh , I 'm all right , " said Doc . " Say , is that place across the street still running ? " A jagged rage whipped Doc upright . " You stay out of there ! " he said . " You old fool ! Lie down and go to sleep . " " Why should n't I go ? Am I to deny myself the loveliness of women if the price is right ? I can hear the tinkle of their sweet voices and see the heaving of their white round-ness  --  " " Oh , shut up ! " Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't remember that you ever starved for love even when it was less near and less reasonable . " " You go to hell , " said Doc . " But you go to hell here . "  |p172At  the very moment Doc and Old Jingleballicks were quarrelingover a matter neither of them understood , Mack was sitting , body comfortable but spirit disturbed , in Fauna 's office bedroom . In his hand he held a Venetian glass bud vase of whisky . He was pouring out to Fauna a problem that had not come up in his life for many years . " Do n't think that there ai n't been parties before at the Palace , and fights , " he said . " Why , when the news come that Gay had went to his reward we give a memorial shindigthat they do n't hardly do no better at the Salinas Rodeo . Gay would of been proud of it  --  if he could of got in . " Fauna said , " There 's talk around that three mourners went to join Gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to expect a certain amount of accidents , " said Mack modestly . " That was all fine . But this here 's something special . Not only are loyal hearts framing their dear friend for a hunk of charity , but we got a doubleheader . Right in the Palace Flophouse the holy bounds of matrimony got its spikes dug in on the starting line . This here 's a halcyon brawl . I and the boys got real delicate feelings about it . " " But no clothes , " said Fauna . " Right ! We think somebody got to set a standard . If thep173loyal friends look like mugs , what 'll the mugs look like ? " Fauna nodded . " I see what you mean . How far you want to go  --  monkeysuits ? " " God no ! " Mack said . " Just pants and coats made out of the same stuff and nobody gets in without he 's got a necktieon , and none of them bow ties that light up neither . This is a goddam solemn moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mack went on , " I ai n't as young as I was . I do n't know how many more parties I can take . " " Do n't none of us get no younger , " said Fauna . She tapped her teeth with the pencil . As it happened , she also had a problem , and she intended to ask Mack 's advice . Now , suddenly , the two problems crashed together and a solution for both was born . Into Fauna 's eyes came the light of triumph as she murmured , " I got it ! " " Give it to me gentle , " said Mack . " I did n't get much sleep today . " Fauna got up and found the stick with which she directedastrological traffic or whacked a protruding piece of bad posture . She talked better with the wand in her hand . " This here calls for a drink , " she said , and she poured it . Mack turned the stem of the bud vase in his fingers and sighted through his drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fauna said , " There was a queen a long time ago and she was loaded . Did n't think nothing of paying a couple hundredbucks for a housedress . Got so many bracelets she could n't bend her arms . You know what she done when she had a birthday or a hanging or something ? " " Overalls , " said Mack.  | " No , but you 're close . Dressed like she 's a milkmaid . They 'd wash up a cow and the queen 'd sit on a gold stool and take a whang at milking . And there 's another old dame . Just the top cream of the top cream . Gives them parties ca n't nobody get in . She wears a headrag . Done it for years . If you look over the crowd and do n't see a headrag  --  sheai n't there . " Mack 's hand shook as he raised the bud vase to his lips . " Is it what I think ? " " Masquerade ! " cried Fauna . " There 's only two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got too much and people who ai n't got nothing . " Mack smiled inwardly to himself . " Can I have a freshener ? " he asked . " Help yourself , " said Fauna . " Masquerade has got other things too . People get kind of bored with who they are . Makes them something else for a while . " Mack spoke with reverence . " They used to say , if you got something you ca n't figure out , give it to Mack . Fauna , it 's your dice . You 're a bull-bitch idear dame . God te-tumturnHis wonders to perform . " " Like it ? " " Like it ! Fauna , this here 's one Life magazine would give its ass for an invite . " " We got to have a theme . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , we ca n't let people just run wild . You do n't know what kind of stuff they 'd wear . I do n't want no tramp and gunnysack party . " " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about At the court of the Fairy Queen ? ' "  | " No , " said Mack . " First place , we got no right to hurt Joe Elegant 's feelings ; second place , the cops  --  " " Well , how about then Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . ' " " I seen the picture , " said Mack . " I think you got something . Some of them dwarfs looked like mugs . I ca n't see Hazel as no fairy , but he 'd do fine as a great big overgroweddwarf . " " That 's what 's nice about it , " said Fauna . " Give 's you some leeway . " " Do you think this might call for a drink ? " " I sure as hell do ! You spread the word , Mack , will you ? You come either as a dwarf , a prince , or a princess , or you damn well do n't get in . Hold that vase steady . " " But not Doc , " said Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five 'll get you seven Doc wears a tie . " The communications system on Cannery Row is mysterious to the point of magic and rapid to the speed of light . Fauna and Mack came to the decision that the party should be a masquerade on Friday evening at 9 : I 11/2 . By 9 : I 2 the magic had started , and by 9:30 everyone who was not asleep , drunk , or away , knew about it . One particularly mean woman who had n't had a man for a long time commented ,  | " How will you know whether they 're in costume or not ? "  --  a statement clearly drawn from her own state of misery . But mainly the news was received with wonder and joy . Mack 's tom-wallager had achieved the stature of a bullbitchtom-wallager . Consider what was in store for the ticket holders : a party at the Palace Flophouse ; a raffle that amounted to a potlatch ; an engagement of exciting proportions unknown in the annals of the Row ; and , on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been enough . Togetherthey threatened to be a celebration close to a catastrophe . Fauna breathed a sigh of relief for it solved her greatest problem . She wanted to dress Suzy in a certain way , and Suzy , being the tough monkey she was , would have resisted . Now it was easy . There 's little difference between the wardrobe of Snow White and that of a lovely young bride . There will be those who will consider that Fauna took too much upon herself in engineering a marriage without the knowledge or collusion of either party , and such skepticswill be perfectly right . But it was Fauna 's conviction , born out of long experience , that most people , one , did not know what they wanted ; two , did not know how to go about getting it ; and three , did n't know when they had it . Fauna was one of those rare people who not only have convictions but are quite willing to take responsibility for them . She knew that Doc and Suzy should be together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shy to bring about that happy state , Fauna was prepared to do it for them . Her critics will cry , " Suppose she is wrong !  |p177Maybe  this association has no chance of success . " And Fauna 's answer to this , if she had heard it , would have been , " They ai n't doing so good now . It might work . What they got to lose ? And when you look at it , what chance has anybody got ? Doc put on a tie , did n't he ? And if I 'm wrong it 's my fault . Sure , they 'll fight now and then . Who do n't ? But maybe they 'll get something too . What 's the odds for anybody ? " And if it was suggested that people should have the right to choose for themselves after thinking it over , she would have replied , " Who thinks ? I can think because I ai n't part of it .

" Youcould n't win an argument with Fauna because she would agree with you and then go right on as she had planned . She had taken up astrology because she had found that people who wo n't take advice from a wise and informed friend will blindly follow the orders of planets  --  which , by all reports , are fairly remote and aloof . Doc would refuse astrology , so he had to be sandbagged . Fauna expected nothanks . She had given that up long ago . Doc could notinterpret the black voice of his guts , but it sounded loudin Fauna 's ears . She knew his loneliness . When she was withhim , that low voice drowned out all the others . On Saturday morning she made every girl in the house bring out every article of clothing she possessed and lay it on the bed in her office . Now Mabel was a natural-born , blowed-in-the-glass hustler . In any time , under any system , after a period of orientation , Mabel would have found herself doing exactly178 Sweet Thursdaywhat she was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fate , but rather a combination of aptitudes and inclinations . Born in a hovel or a castle , Mabel would have gravitatedtoward hustling . The heap of finery on Fauna 's bed was impressive . Some of those dresses could have got a girl booked for vagrancy just going out to mail a letter . Mabel took Fauna aside and spoke to her privately . " My grandma come from the old country , " she said when the door of her room was closed . Mabel opened the bottom drawer of her bureau and lifted out a brown paper parcel sealed against air with strips of cellophane tape . " Grandma left it to Mama , and Mama left it to me , " she said as she tore the paper . " We ai n't none of us needed it . " She removedlayer after layer of tissue paper and at last spread a dress out on her bed  --  a wedding dress of sheerest white linen embroidered with sprays of white flowers  --  stitches so tiny they seemed to grow out of the cloth . The bodice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box and laid beside the dress a silver wedding crown . " I guess she would n't hurt it none , " said Mabel . " Tell her not to spill nothing on it . I 'll polish up the crown , it 's kind of tarnished  --  real silver ! " Fauna was speechless for once . Her fingers went to the light and lovely fabric . She was a hard woman to break up , but the dress nearly did it . " Snow White ! " she said breathlessly . " I better be careful or I 'll get to believing my own pitch . Mabel , I 'm going to give you my jet earrings . " " I do n't want nothing . " " You want my jet earrings ! "  | " Aw shoot ! " said Mabel . " Looks like it might nearly fit her , " Fauna observed . " Well , we can kind of tack it where it do n't . " " You know , you 're a good girl . You want I should go towork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabel . " I like it here . There 's a veil too in this here bag . " " I do n't know if we can get away with a veil , but we 'll try , " said Fauna . " Oh hell , she do n't know a veil from a hole in the ground , " said Mabel . If only people would give the thought , the care , the judgment to international affairs , to politics , even to their jobs , that they lavish on what to wear to a masquerade , the world would run in greased grooves . On the surface CanneryRow was quieter than usual , but below the surface it seethed . In one corner of the Palace Flophouse , Whitey No. 2 gave careful lessons to little Johnny Carriaga in the art of palming cards . Johnny had been borrowed for the occasion  --  or , more truthfully , rented  --  since Alberto Carriagahad received sixty-two cents , the price of a gallon of wine , for the use of his firstborn . It was planned that Johnny should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrow , and quiver . The quiver was added as a hiding place for the winning raffle ticket . For although nearly everyone on the Row knew the raffle was rigged , a certain pride made it necessary to carry the deception off with dignity . Because of a small distrust of Johnny the arrows in the quiver were tipped with rubber suction cups.  |p180Whitey  No. 2 had cut a card the exact size of a raffle ticket . " Now try it again , Johnny , " he said . " No , I can see the edge of it . Look ! Sort of squeeze the edges in your palm , like this . Now try it again . That 's right ! That 's good . Now let 's see you get it out of the quiver . You make a pass with the bow  --  like this  --  so they look at your other hand , and you say  --  " " I know , " said Johnny . " I 'm Cupid , God of Love , and I draw a bead on unsuspecting hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Eddie . " I wonder where Mack got that ? " " He made it up , " said Whitey No. 2 . " Now when you shove up the bow with your right hand , you get the ticket out of the quiver with your left . Try it . " " I-am-Cupid-God-of-Love , ' " said Johnny , and he brandished the bow . " That 's good , " said Whitey No. 2 . " It will take a little more practice though . Do n't look at your left hand , Johnny . Look at the bow . Now here 's the bowl . Dig around the cards without dropping the ticket . Go on , prac-tice . " " I want thirty-five cents , " said Johnny . " What ! " " If I do n't get thirty-five cents I 'll tell . " " Mack , " said Whitey No. 2 , " this here kid 's jumped the price . " " Give it to him , " said Mack . " I 'll flip him double or nothing later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " said Johnny . " Seems like kids got no respect for their elders now/adays , " Eddie observed . " If I ever said that , my old man would of clobbered me . " " Maybe your old man was n't rigging no raffle , " said Johnny . Whitey No. i said , " This kid ai n't honest . You know where bad kids go , Johnny ? " " I sure do , and I been there , " said Johnny . " Give him the thirty-five cents , " said Mack . What hidden , hoarded longings there are in all of us ! Behind the broken nose and baleful eye may be a gentle courtier ; behind the postures and symbols and myths of Joe Elegant there may be the hunger to be a man . If one could be , for only an evening , whatever in the world one wished , what would it be ? What secret would come out ? To a certain extent the theme of the Palace Flophouse raffle and engagement party was chosen because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had reviewedthe story , asked questions , and got as clear a picture as he ever got of anything , Hazel elected to be Prince Charming . He saw himself in white silk knee breeches and an Eton jacket , his left hand fondling the hilt of a small sword . They offered him Grumpy , lovable old Grumpy , the prize part of all . They offered him Sweet Pea the Skunk , but Hazel stuck to his dream . It was Prince Charming or he would n't attend . Friendships have foundered on less . " All right , " said Mack , " you go ahead . I was going to help you with your costume , but I know when I 'm stumped . Hazel , if you 're Prince Charming , you 're on your own . "  | " Who cares ? " said Hazel . " Who wants your help ? I 'll bet you 're mad because you wanted to be Prince Charm-ing . " " Not me , " said Mack . " I 'm going as a tree . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forest , ai n't it ? " said Mack . " I want a little anenmity . You ca n't see the tree for the forest . " Hazel went to sit under the cypress tree . He was gloomy and he was frightened because ideas did not come to him , and when he sought them they ran screaming away . But he was determined . He could not let the office down . A man sentenced to be President could not go as a dwarf . It was n't dignified . Later in the morning he went to the back door of the Bear Flag and called for help from Joe Elegant . Joe smiled . " I 'll help you , " he said maliciously . All over the Row trunks were being opened , and the smell of mothballs penetrated as far as the middle of the street . And all over the Row the story was being rewritten to fit the wardrobe . By unspoken agreement no one planned to be Snow White . In Western Biological , Doc awakened wracked with pain from sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to isolate the part of him that hurt worst . Not the least of his agony was his memory of forcing Old Jingleballicksto take his bed . A crazy , alcoholic generosity , probablymasochistic in origin , had prompted the sacrifice . He raised up on one shattered elbow and looked at the old bastard sleeping so sweetly  --  his halo of yellow hair surroundinghis polished pink pate , his breath puffing in small comfortable snores.  | " Wake up ! " Doc shouted in fury . The pale eyes flickered . " What 's for breakfast ? " said Old Jay . " Do n't you even have the decency to have a hangover ? " " Certainly I do , " said Old Jay with dignity . " How 's about some beer ? " " Does your head ache ? " " Yes . " " Do your joints ache ? " " Yes . " " Do you have low-blood-pressure depression ? " " Overwhelming . " " Then I 've got you , " said Doc . " You get the beer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half if you get it . " " No . " " Tell you what I 'll do  --  I 'll loan you the money . " " No . " Old Jingleballicks ' eyes were bleak . " Reach me my pants , " he said , and he fished out a quarter and a dime and held them out . " No , " said Doc . " God in heaven ! What do you want ? " " I want two dollars . " " Why , that would be six bottles ! " " Exactly . You 're trapped , Old Jingleballicks , and you know it . " Old Jay dug deep and found two one-dollar bills . " Maybe I can write it off to entertainment , " he said . Doc pulled on pants and shirt and went across the street . He took his time . He drank a bottle of beer quickly andp184then sipped a second while he heard the news of the day from Joseph and Mary . Back in the laboratory he put the four cold remaining bottles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Jay . " I drank your change , " said Doc . He was beginning to feel good . He saw the stricken look . " You cheap old fraud , " he said happily , " for once you 've been had . " And he went on , " I wish I could understand you . You must have millions and yet you pinch and squirm and cheat . Why ? " " Please give me beer . I 'm dying , " said Old Jingleballicks . " Then die a little longer , " said Doc . " I love to see you die ! " " It 's not my fault , " Old Jay said . " It 's a state of mind . You might call it the American state of mind . The tax laws are creating a whole new kind of man  --  a psyche rather than a psychosis . Two or three generations and we 'll maybe set the species . Can I have beer now ? " " No . " " If a man has any money he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Can I deduct it ? ' Two men fight over a luncheon check when both of them are going to deduct it anyway  --  a whole nation conditioned to dishonesty by its laws , because honesty is penalized . But it 's worse than that . If you 'll just hand me a bottle I 'll tell you . " " Tell me first . " " I did n't write the tax laws , " Old Jay said , trembling . " The only creative thing we have is the individual , but the law does n't permit me to give money to an individual . I must give it to a group , an organization  --  and the onlyp185thing a group has ever created is bookkeeping . To participate in my gift the individual must become part of the group and thus lose his individuality and his creativeness . I did n't write the law . I hate a law that stifles generosity and makes charity good business . Corporations are losing their financial efficiency because waste pays . I deplore it , but I do it . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to you because with taxes a four-hundred-dollar microscopecosts me twelve hundred dollars  --  if 1 give it to you  --  and nothing if I give it to an institution . Why , if you , through creative work , should win a prize , most of the money would go in taxes . 1 do n't mind taxes , God knows ! But I do mind the kind of law that makes of charity not the full warmness of sharing but a stinking expediency . And now , if you do n't hand me a beer , I shall be forced  --  " " Here 's your beer , " said Doc . " What 's for breakfast ? " " God knows . The party at the Palace Flophouse tonight is a masquerade . Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . ' " " Why ? " " I do n't know . " " I shall go as a red dwarf , " said Old Jingleballicks . " A dying star , " said Doc . " It kind of fits you with that hair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast redundant . Doc went back for six more bottles , and in a burst of generosity he brought back the Bohemia . " Now there 's beer for you , " said Old Jingleballicks . " The Mexicans are a great and noble people . The Pyramid of the Sun and this beer  --  whole civilizations have producedless . You started to tell me about your paper lastp186night but you got deflected by a girl . I 'd like to see that girl . " " I 'd like to tell you about my paper . I want to draw some parallels between emotional responses in cephalopods and in humans , and I 'd like to observe the pathological changes that go with these responses . Now the body walls of octopi are semi-transparent . With proper equipment it might be possible to observe these changes as they happen . Sometimesthe simpler organisms can give us a key to the more complex . Dementia praecox , for example , was considered purely a psychotic manifestation until it was observed that there were physical symptoms as well . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be afraid to . A kind of terror comes over me when I start . " " What have you got to lose if you fail ? " " Nothing . " " What have you got to gain if you succeed ? " " I do n't know . " Old Jingleballicks regarded Doc benignly . " Have you got enough beer in you so you are n't quarrelsome ? " " I 'm never quarrelsome . " " The hell you are n't ! Took my head off last night . You hurt my feelings . " " I 'm sorry . What did you want to say ? " " Will you let me finish if I start ? " " I 'll try . " Old Jay said , " You feel to me like a woman who has never had a baby but knows all the words . There 's a lack of fulfillment in you . I think you have violated something or withheld something from yourself  --  almost as thoughp187you were eating plenty but no Vitamin A. You are n't hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ca n't imagine anything I lack . I have freedom , comfort , and the work I like . What have I missed ? " " Well , last night , in every conversation , a girl namedSuzy crept in  --  " " For God 's sake ! " said Doc . " Do you know what Suzy is ? An illiterate little tramp , a whore ! I took her out to dinner because Fauna asked me to . I found her interesting the way I 'd find a new species of octopus interesting , that 's all . You 've always been a goddam fool , Old Jingleballicks , but you 've never been a romantic damn fool . " " Who 's talking about romance ? I was speaking of hunger . Maybe you ca n't be wholly yourself because you 've never given yourself wholly to someone else . " " Of all the esoteric goddam nonsense ! " Doc cried . " Why I give floor room to you I do n't know . " " Then try to figure out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " " Well , are n't you putting a lot of energy into denyingsomething which , if it is not true , deserves no denial ? " " Sometimes I think you 're just plain nuts , " said Doc . " Know what I 'm going to do ? " said Old Jay . " I 'm goingto buy a bottle of whisky . " " 1 do n't believe it ! " said Doc.  |p188Very  few people know that Hazel had given the Palace Flophouse its name years ago when the boys had first moved in . Inspired by the glory of having a home , Hazel compounded the name of something he knew about and something he did n't , the known and the unknown , the homely and the exotic ; and , ever after , the name had stuck , so that it was known by certain people from one end of the state to the other . And the Palace Flophouse had justified its name over the years . It had been shelter and home base to the boys . Also , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impressive  --  redwood board and bat , tarpaper roof , twenty-eight feet long , fourteen feet wide , two square windows , and two doors , one on each side . Into this simple box Mack and the boys had moved some remarkable articles , the products of their wits , their work , and sometimes their misfortune . The great cast-iron stove was in excellent condition and bid fair to outlast the Colosseum which it resembled . The grandfather clock , once the home of a dog , stood empty now  --  and Eddie wanted to be buried in it . Each of the beds was canopied as a substitute for mending the roof , and Gay 's bed was kept just as it was when he went away  --  patchworkquilt turned down to reveal a gray tennis-flannelp189sheet . His copy of Amazing True Desert Stories , folded open to page 62 , lay on top of the apple box just as Gay had left it ; and his prize possession , a collector 's item , a ring gear and pinions of a 1914 Willys-Knight , lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the shelf over his bed the boys kept some kind of nosegay in a swanky swig glass , for Gay had loved flowers . He ate them  --  particularly red roses , mustard flowers , wild turnip blossoms , and the petals of one variety of dahlia . No one had ever been allowed to sit or sleep in Gay 's bed . He might return one day , the boys thought , even though he was reported dead and his Army insurance paid . Now there had been tom-wallagers in the Palace Flophousebut never such a bull-bitch tom-wallager as was now in the process of exploding . The outside was freshly whitewashed . Beds were pushed together , and the interior was a bower of pine boughs crossed to make a canopy . The great stove was laid out as a bar and the oven was full of cracked ice . In front of the back door a little stage was built , with a painter 's dropcloth for a curtain and the door for an entrance  --  for certain theatrical effects , not countingthe raffle itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted by Japanese lanterns , and a string of lanterns led down to the chicken walk above the railroad track . The boys were pleased with their effort . Mack surveyed the scene and put a name to it that was remembered . " A veritable fairyland , " he said . The Patron had contributed his prize group of musicians , the original Espaldas Mojadas  --  two guitars , gourds , bones , castanets , and Haitian drum , and last , a guitaron as big as a rowboat . Cacahuete Rivas , the nephew of the Patron , wasp190scheduled to join his trumpet to the band later , but now he was on the beach , practicing his solo softly . As evening came to Cannery Row the boys were tired but content . Following Mack 's lead , they all agreed to be trees . After all , they were the hosts . Their one sorrow was that Hazel had left them . His yearning to be Prince Charming had overcome his love for his friends . in Joe Elegant 's tiny bedroom he was being transformed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized for the twentieth time . " Hazel 's such a mug you forget he 's sensitive . Hell , I could of worked out some kind of charmingrig if I 'd give it some thought . Do n't seem right withouthim here to mess things up . " It is customary at most masquerades for the arriving guests to be shy , ill at ease , and sober , and to stand around uneasily for maybe an hour before the party warms up . In this matter of starting a party Cannery Row is far ahead of some other centers of culture . The party was to start at nine p.m. sharp . The guests would be notified by the trumpet of Cacahuete Rivas , playing " Whistle While You Work . " At least two hours before the signal a series of small earnest parties , at Wide Ida 's , the Bear Flag , and in private homes , were practicing for the main event . This party was going to begin in full bloom . Of course Mack and the boys were so weighed down with responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor ; still , they made progress , and they watched the big hand of the alarm clock on the back of the stove.  |p191In  the Bear Flag the pageantry was spread all over the floor . Snow White was going to have , as ladies of honor , some of the best-known and most respected hookers north of San Luis Obispo . The ladies were dressing in filmy gowns of red , yellow , and green , and each one was to carry a bottle of whisky garlanded with ribbons to match her dress . Fauna was going as a witch . It was her own idea . The only costume she really needed was a broom , but she had made a peaked black hat and a black alpaca wraparoundto carry the part off . But Fauna had a payoff . When the big moment came she was prepared to fling off her black gown , switch broom for wand , and emerge as the fairy godmother . Wide Ida 's was dwarf country . Eight Happys , four Sneezys , six Dopeys , and nineteen Grumpys clustered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and a half part harmony . Joseph and Mary had elected to go as Dracula . He had n't seen Snow White , but to him a moving picture was a moving picture . At Western Biological , Doc and Old Jingleballicks were hopelessly enmeshed in a discussion of tobacco mosaic . When the dam had burst a flood followed . A garbage can stood in the middle of the floor , and in it , nestled in crushed ice , the six remaining bottles of a case of champagne bought by Old Jay . Doc and Old Jay had completely forgotten the party . When Cacahuete 's trumpet sounded the call to arms they were shouting so loud they did n't hear it . When the youth and beauty of Cannery Row walked gaily up the lantern/lit chicken walk Old Jay and Doc were still screaming at each other . Suddenly Doc dropped his voice , and it had the effect of a loud noise . " I think I will go away , " he said . " I have tried with every sinew and I have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Young man , you are at the threshold of a great career . " " But what do I care for honors ? " " How do you know ? You never got any , " said Old Jay . " Do n't try to hold me back , Old Jingle . " " I wo n't . There 's too many of you already . Do you realize you have n't cooked any dinner ? " " I bought a pound of hamburger and you ate it raw before I got it near a pan . " " You should n't starve yourself , young friend , " said Old Jingleballicks . Eddie hurled himself up the steps and flung open the door . " Doc ! " he cried . " For God 's sakes ! She 's started ! They 're going to draw ! " Doc picked a bottle from the ice . " Arm yourself , Old Jingleballicks . Forward ! " They had to help Old Jay up the chicken walk . The drawing was being held for them . Dwarfs , animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain . " I guess we 're all here , " said Mack . He looked behind the curtain . " You all right , Johnny ? " " Goddam cold , " said Johnny . And at that moment Hazel entered proudly , his chin up , his eyes flashing with dignity . Joe Elegant had worked all day to get his revenge on mankind , and Hazel was thep193result . The basis of his costume was long gray underwear , to which were sewed hearts , diamonds , spades , and clubs in red and black . Hazel 's army shoes had yellow pompoms on the toes . An Elizabethan ruff of stiff paper was around his neck , and on his head a Knight Templar 's hat with a white ostrich plume . From the belt around his middle hung a long scabbard . His right hand proudly held a cavalry saber at salute . Joe Elegant had concentrated his revenge in one area . The drop seat of the costume had been removed and in its place , right on the essential surface of Hazel himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red and blue . Hazel was a breathtaking sight . He did not glance around . He knew he was right  --  he knew it by the silence . Smartly he turned the saber to parade rest and crossed his hands on the hilt . His breath caught in his throat. " 1 , " he said huskily , " I am Prince Charming . " And the company could see now that his cheeks were rouged and his eyelashes beaded. " 1 proteck dam  --  damsels , " he announced . And only then did he turn his proud head for the applause and approval he knew he merited . There were tears in Mack 's eyes . " You done fine , Hazel baby , " he said . " Could n't nobody do better . Who helped you ? " " Joe Elegant , " said Hazel . " What a nice guy ! " Whitey No. z moved up at Mack 's imperceptible signal . " You want I should go now ? " " Right now , " said Mack softly . " Kick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their soft talk . " Mr. Joe Elegant presents his compliments , " he said . " He is sorryp194he can not attend as he had to leave town on business . Let 's see  --  is that all ?  --  yep , that 's all . " " We 'll thank him when he comes back , " said Mack grimly . The guests looked at Hazel with stricken eyes , and no one laughed . One glance at Mack 's jutting chin and doubledfists stopped that impulse . " Get on with it , " Wide Ida growled . Mack pulled himself together , advanced to the curtain , and turned to face the guests . " Fellow citizens , " he said , " right here in Cannery Row lives a guy that there ca n't nobody want a better friend . For years we have took his bounty without sharing nothingback at him . Now this guy needs a certain article that runs into dough . Therefore it is the pleasure of I and the boys to raffle off the Palace Flophouse to buy a microscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cur-tain ! " Doc shouted , " Mack ! You 're crazy ! " " Shut up ! " said Mack . " Curtain . " The cloth was pulled aside to reveal Johnny Carriaga dressed in an aluminum supporter and a pair of blue paper wings . Johnny brandished his bow . " I-am-Cupid-God-ofLove ! " he shouted . Then the winning ticket slipped from his palm and fluttered to the floor . Johnny scrambled after it , yelling , " **34;7692;TOOLONG . " He grabbed the ticket and turned to Mack . " What do I do now ? " he asked . Mack gave up . " Oh , what the hell ! " Then he shouted , " ls that the ticket you have drawn , Cupid ? "  | " I have plucked from the many . " Johnny had n't been near the bowl but he yelled it anyway . " Give it to me , you little bastard , " said Mack quietly . " Friends , " he said , " do my eyes deceive me ? This is a surprise ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to announce that the Palace Flophouse has passed into the hands of Doc . " Doc was jarred toward sobriety . He moved close to Mack . " You 're crazy ! " he said . " Like a fox , " said Mack . " Who told you you owned it ? I did n't tell . " " How do you mean , Doc ? " " I did n't think Chong told anybody but me . He was afraid you 'd do something like this . " Mack said , " Let 's you and I step outside . " Under the lanterns they faced each other . Doc popped the champagne cork and handed the bottle to Mack , who cupped his mouth over the glistening foam . " What was you saying , Doc ? " he asked quietly . " Chong wanted you and the boys to have a home . He deeded it to you and put up the money for ten years ' taxes . " " Well , why n't he tell us ? " " He was afraid if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you would n't have a home . " Mack was shaken . " Doc , " he said , " would you do me the favor ? Do n't tell the boys . " " Why , sure . " " Shake on it ? " " Shake ! Have a drink . "  |p196Suddenly  Mack laughed . " Doc , " he said , " I and the boys want to ask will you rent the joint to us ? " " Sure I will , Mack . " " I hope they never find out . They 'd skin me , " said Mack . " Would n't it be simpler if we just forgot the raffle ? " " No , sir ! " said Mack . " Chong was right . I would n't trust the boys not to sell her sometime when they need a buck . I would n't trust myself . " The visit of Old Jingleballicks had put Doc 's system to an outrageous test . Meals had been infrequent , sleep fitful , emotions on stilts , and the intake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pleasant swimming state into something resembling sobriety , but not very closely . A fog of unreality like a dream feeling was not in him but all around him . He went inside the Palace and saw the dwarfs and monsters and the preposterous Hazel all lighted by the flickering lanterns . None of it seemed the fabric of sweet reality . The music was deafening . Old Jay danced by , clutching a pale brunette to his stomach as though she were a pain  --  a disgusting sight , and as unreal as the rest . Anyone untrained in tom-wallagers might well have been startled at this tom-wallager . Eddie waltzed to the rumba music , his arms embracing an invisible partner . Wide Ida lay on the floor Indian wrestling with Whitey No. 2 , at each try displaying acres of pink panties , while a wild conga line of dwarfs and animals milled about . Johnny Carriaga ran wild . Standing on a box , he fired at random but not at unsuspecting hearts . Mrs. Alfred Wong had a rubber-tipped arrow stuck between her shoulderblades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flamesp197and set fire to three dwarfs , so that they had to be put out with a punch bowl . Mack and Doc were swept into the conga line . To Doc the room began to revolve slowly and then to rise and fall like the deck of a stately ship in a groundswell . The music roared and tinkled . Hazel beat out rhythm on the stove with his sword until Johnny , aiming carefully , got a bull 's eye on Hazel . Hazel leaped in the air and came down on the oven door , scattering crushed ice all over the floor . One of the guests had got wedged in the grandfather clock . From the outside the Palace Flophouse seemed to swell and subside like rising bread . Doc cupped his hands close to Mack 's ear . " Where 's Fauna and the girls ? " he shouted . " Later , " Mack cried . " What ? " " Coming later , " and he added , " Better get here pretty soon before the joint burns down . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point Whitey No. i fought his way to Mack 's side and yelled , " Mack , they 're coming ! " Mack rushed to the Espaldas Mojadas and raised both hands at them . Johnny aimed his last arrow at the guitaron and took the fret out clean . " Hold it ! " Mack screamed . The music stopped , and silence fell on the room . Then the unrealest part of all began to happen . Very softly the sound of a sweet muted trumpet whispered , and the crazy thing was playing the " Weddingp198March " from Lohengrin , and even as Doc listened the sly brass began playing with it , slid into minors , took a short rhythm ride , and moaned away at blues . The dancers were very still , almost stuffed . Doc found the source of the music  --  CacahueteRivas in the corner of the room , muting his trumpet with a damp sponge . Then in this dream the paint-splashed curtain was pulled aside , and Fauna , the witch , came through the door , straddlinga broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify about this . I 'd get the booby-hatch ! Fauna barked , " This here 's a very happy occasion . " She looked around . " Doc , come here . " He moved vaguely toward her . Four girls from the Bear Flag came through the door , dressed in blinding colors . They ranged themselves two on each side of the door , facing inward , holding their beribbonedwhisky bottles to make an arch . Fauna dismounted from her broom and ripped off her black wrapper , displaying a sheath of silver lame . In her hand miraculously appeared a silver wand tipped with a gold star . She struck a pose , riding on her toes as though prepared for flight . " I am your fairy godmother , " she shouted . " I bring you Snow White , the bride ! " Then Suzy appeared in the doorway , a transformed Suzy in a wedding gown . The silver crown was on her head , and from its points a veil was suspended . She looked lovely and young and excited . Her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your girl ! " Doc shook his head to try to wake up . It was a dream ,  |p199a  craziness , the crown , the veil , the virginity . " What in hell is going on ? " It happens that two people standing apart can dip into each other 's thoughts . Suzy read his mind or his face . An embarrassed red crept up her neck and darkened her cheeks . She closed her eyes . And Doc 's mind read her pain . His world spun like a top . He heard himself say , " Fairy Godmother , I accept-my  --  girl . " Suzy opened her eyes and looked in Doc 's eyes . Then her jaw muscles tightened and her eyes grew fierce ; her sweet mouth hardened to a line . She took off the crown and veil , looked at them a moment , and placed them gently on an apple box . The crazy trumpet put a samba beat to the " Wedding March " and a guitar took up the throbbing . " Listen , you mugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with a stumblebum in a culvert and be a good wife . 1 could marry a yellow dog and be nice to him . But good Christ ! Not Doc ! " Suddenly she turned and darted out the door . Fauna plunged after her . There was no chicken walk out the back way . Suzy slipped and rolled down the embankmentand Fauna rolled after her . On the railroad track they gathered themselves together . " You goddam grandstanding bitch ! " said Fauna bitterly . " What do you mean  --  ' not Doc ? ' " " I love him , " said Suzy.  |p200One  of the common reactions to shock is lethargy . If , after an automobile accident , one man is howling and writhing and another sits quietly staring into space , it is usually the quiet man who is badly hurt . A community can go into shock too . Cannery Row did . People drew into themselves , kept their doors closed , and did n't visit . Everyone felt guilty , even those who had not planned the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys were doubled up with a sense of unhappyfate . It was their third try at doing something nice for Doc , and it was their third failure . They did not know where to turn to escape their own scorn . Wide Ida became fiercely taciturn . Her customers drank in silence to escape the guilty rage they knew was just under her muscular surface . Fauna grieved like a lost setter dog . In a lifetime of preposterous plans she had discovered some failures but never before a catastrophe . Even the Patron experienced little flashes of an emotion new to him . Always before he had managed to swap guilt for blame of circumstance or enemy , but now his accusing finger bent like a comedy pistol and aimed at his own heart . It was an interesting pain , but a pain nevertheless . He became kindly and thoughtful of all around him  --  anp201attitude that frightened people who knew him . There is nothing reassuring about the smile of a tiger . As for Doc , he was undergoing reorganization so profoundthat he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken apart on a jeweler 's table  --  all jewels and springs and balances laid out ready for reassembling . For pain or frustration the human has many anodynes , not the least of which is anger . Doc quarreled viciously with Old Jingleballicks , ordered him out , and told him never to return . Then Doc fought with the expressman over the quality of the service he had been getting , although it had n't varied in ten years . Finally he let the word be passed that he was working and did not want to see anyone from Cannery Row or anyplaceelse . He sat over his yellow pad , the neat pile of Suzy 's sharpened pencils beside him , and in his eyes the bleak look of shock . Suzy was at once the cause and the victim of the disintegrationof the Row . It can not be said that trouble builds character , for just as often it destroys character . But if certain character traits , mixed with certain dreams , are subjected to the fire , sometimes . . . sometimes .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less tired at ten in the morning than at midnight . She was always tired . She not only accepted this but thought everybody was that way . She could not conceive of feet that did not hurt , of a back that did not ache , or of a cook with a good disposition . At breakfast the row of gobbling mouths ruined her appetite and she never got it back . In the slack time around ten she cleaned and mopped thep202moist restaurant and swept the crumbs from under the counter stools . Joe Blaikey came in for his morning coffee . " Just making a fresh pot . Want to wait ? " Ella said . " Sure , " said Joe . " Say , Ella , you heard what happened down in Cannery Row Saturday night ? " " No . What ? " " I do n't know . There was a party . I was going to it . Time I got there it was over . Nobody wants to talk about it . " " I did n't hear , " said Ella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . They 'd talk about a fight . They love a fight . Everybody seems to feel kind of ashamed of something . Let me know if you hear anything , will you ? " " Okay . Coffee 's about ready , Joe . " Suzy came in , dressed in her San Francisco suit  --  gray herringbone tweed , very neat and smart . She sat down on a stool . " Hi , " said the cop . " Hi , " said Suzy . " Cup of coffee . " " Just going through the grounds now . Say , that 's a cute outfit , " said Ella . " Frisco , " said Suzy . " You moving out ? " " No , " said Suzy , " I 'm staying . " Joe said , " What happened down on the Row the other night ? " Suzy shrugged her shoulders . " You wo n't talk neither , huh ? " " Nope . " " Damnedest thing I ever saw ! " said Joe . " Mostly they'dp203break their necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better spill it . You ever hear of that material-witness stuff ? " " Nobody got killed , " said Suzy . And then , " Your name 's Ella , ai n't it ? " " Till now . " " Remember you said you was n't never off shift ? " " Well , I ai n't , " said Ella . " Would you give me a try ? Watch me a couple weeks . Then maybe you could go to a movie . " " Sister , you come to the wrong place . This joint do n't make enough profit to hire no waitress . " " I 'll do it for my meals , and I do n't eat much . " Joe Blaikey looked away . It was his method of paying attention . Ella said , " What 's the gag , sister ? " " No gag . I want a job and I 'll sling hash for my keep . " Joe turned his head back slowly . " You 'd better tell  --  " he suggested . " Sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fix myself up and I ai n't going to run away to do it . " " What made up your mind ? " " That ai n't none of your business . Is it against the law ? " " Happens so seldom it ought to be , " said Joe . " Come on , Ella , " Suzy begged , " give me a break . " Ella asked , " What do you think , Joe ? " Joe 's eyes went over Suzy 's face . He dwelt for a moment on the dyed hair . He said , " You 're letting your hair grow out ? " " Yeah . " " Give her a break , Ella , " he said . Ella smiled a tired smile . " In them clothes ? "  | " I 'll go change . Take me maybe fifteen minutes . I can cook too , Ella . I 'm a pretty good fry cook . " " Go change your clothes , " said Ella . Joe Blaikey waited in the street for Suzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't bitch Ella up , " he said gently . " I wo n't . " " You look excited . " " Joe , " said Suzy , " you remember once you said if I wanted to blow town you 'd lend me the dough ? " " I thought you was staying . " " I am . I wonder could you stake me not to blow town . " " How much ? " " Twenty-five bucks . " " Where you going to live ? " " I 'll let you know . " Joe said , " I staked kids before . What the hell have I got to lose ? " " You 'll get it back . " " I know I will , " said Joe . The boiler that for many years had rested among the mallow weeds in the vacant lot between the Bear Flag and the grocery was the first boiler the Hediondo Cannery ever had , and the Hediondo was the first cannery Monterey ever had . When it was understood that pilchards could be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sealed and then cooked in live steam , a new industry came to Monterery . Hediondo started with small capital and skimped and pioneered its way first to success and finally to oblivion . Its first boiler for producing the cooking steamp205was the triumphant improvisation of William Randolph , engineer , fireman , and president . The boiler itself he got for nothing . It was the whole front end of a locomotive of the Pajaro Valley and Coast Railroad . This engine , encounteringa split rail one night , leaped a trestle and dived twenty feet into a mudhole . The railroad company stripped its wheels and valves , whistle and bell , and left the great cylinder standing in the mud . William Randolph found it , hauled it to Monterery , and set it in concrete at the new Hediondo Cannery . For years it produced low-pressure steam for cooking canned fish , while its tubes blew out at intervals and were replaced . In 1932 , when the cannery was rich and expanding , the old boiler was finally abandoned in the vacant lot to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , althoughretired , he still hated waste . He stripped out the tubes , leaving only the big cylinder , sixteen feet long and seven feet in diameter . The smokestack was still on it , and its firedoor , two feet wide and eighteen inches high , still swung on rusty pins . Many people had used the boiler for temporary shelter , but Mr. and Mrs. Sam Malloy were the first permanent residents . Mr. Malloy , who was good with his hands , after stripping out the remaining tubes , added a number of little comforts . A boiler as a home has disadvantages as well as advantages . Some people would balk at getting down on hands and knees to crawl in through the firedoor . The floor , being rounded , makes for difficulty both in walking and in arranging furniture . The third inconvenience lies in a lack of light.  |p206The  advantages of a boiler can be listed as follows : it is absolutely rainproof ; it is cozy ; and it has wonderful ventilation . By adjusting the damper and firedoor you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokestack Mr. Malloy had built a little brick fireplace for cold winter nights . In addition to all of these advantages , the boiler was fireproof , windproof , earthquake-proof , and almost bombproof . These more than balanced the lack of running water , electricity , and interiorplumbing . There are those , particularly in Carmel-by-the-Sea , who say that Suzy 's choice of the boiler as a home was a symbolicretreat to the womb , and , while this may be true , it is also true that this womb had economic factors . At the Golden Poppy , Suzy had her meals free , and in the boiler she had free shelter . Suzy took the money Joe Blaikey loaned her and went to Holman 's Department Store in Pacific Grove . She bought a hammer , saw , assorted nails , two sheets of plywood , a box of pale blue kalsomine and a brush , a tube of Duco cement , a pair of pink cottage curtains with blue flowers , three sheets , two pillow cases , two towels and a washcloth , a teakettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teabags . At Joe 's Surplus she bought a used army cot and mattress pad , bowl and pitcher and chamberpot , two army blankets , a small mirror , and a kerosene lamp . These supplies exhausted her capital , but at the end of her first week of work at the Golden Poppy , Suzy paid Joe back two dollars and a quarter out of tips . The Row , in its shame , pretended not to see what was going on at the boiler or to hear the sound of hammeringp207late at night . This was good manners rather than a lack of curiosity . Fauna held out for ten days , and when she did give in to her natural nosiness she went secretly , late on a Tuesday night , when the Bear Flag was closed for lack of customers . From the window of the Ready Room , Fauna could see a little glow of light coming from the firedoor of the boiler . The smokestack put out a lazy curl of smoke that smelled of pine pitch . Fauna went silently out the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she called softly . " Who is it ? " " Me , Fauna . " " What do you want ? " " To see if you 're all right . " " I 'm all right . " Fauna got down on her knees and poked her head through the firedoor . The transformation was complete . The curving walls were pale blue , and the curtains were stuck to the walls with Duco cement . It was a pleasant feminine apartment . Suzy sat on her cot in the light from the little fireplace . She had built a dressing table for her mirror and bowl and pitcher , and beside it stood a fruit jar filled with lupines and poppies . " You sure fixed it up nice , " said Fauna . " Ai n't you going to invite me in ? " " Come on in , but do n't get stuck in the door . " " Give me a hand , will you ? " Suzy pulled and boosted her through the firedoor . " Here , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a chair pretty soon . "  | " We could make you a hook rug , " said Fauna . " That would look nice . " " No , " said Suzy . " I want to do it myself . Would you like I should make you a cup of tea ? " " Do n't mind if I do , " said Fauna absently , and then , " You sure you ai n't mad ? " " I ai n't mad . You know , I never had no place of my own before . " " Well , you 've fixed it up real nice , " said Fauna . " I can lend you anything you need . You can use the bathroom over at the Bear Flag . " " They got a shower down at the Golden Poppy , " said Suzy . " Now look , " Fauna said . " You got me down and my claws wedged . Do n't put the boots to me . " " I ai n't . " " This here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , Suzy . I do n't care if you want to hear it or not . I been wrong quite a lot , but you 're going about this wrong . Do n't rub Doc 's nose in it . That just makes a man mad . " " What are you talking about ? " " Well , settling here . He ca n't look out his window without you 're in his hair . " Fauna braced herself for the explosion , and it did not come . Suzy looked at her hands . " I got real nice nails , " she said . " Down at the Poppy where I got my hands in water all the time I squidge lotion on . Keeps them soft . Fauna , you told me not to run away , and I did n't . I felt like digging a hole in the ground and crawling in and 1 did n't , because I think what you said was right . I 'm going to do it right here in sight . "  | " That ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Suzy . " You said about Doc . Now I 'm telling you once , and you can tell it all over the Row if you want , then I wo n't have to tell it to nobody again . You just forget Doc . Doc ai n't got nothing to do with me . He come along and I was n't up to him  --  was n't good enough for him . Now maybe it wo n't never happen again , but if it does  --  if there 's a guy  --  I 'm goddam well going to be good enough for him , inside and outside , public and private ; but mostly I 'm going to feel good enough . Now , you got that ? " " You better watch that cussing , " said Fauna . " I do n't cuss no more . " " You just  --  " " Do n't try to mix me up , " said Suzy . " Did you get what I said ? " " Why , sure , Suzy girl ! But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a hand . " " ' Cause then it would n't be me done it . Then 1 would n't be no good . " " You borrowed dough from Joe Blaikey . " " Sure , from a cop . The same cop that was going to float me . He ai n't a friend , he 's a cop . When I get him paid back maybe he can be a friend . " " You sure make it tough on yourself . " " How else ? You ca n't cut off a leg with a banana . " " You was n't never no hustler , Suzy . At least you was n't no good at it . " " I know what I was , and I know what I 'm going to be . " " Doc ? " Fauna asked  | " That 's done , I tell you ! Get it through your thick head  --  that 's done ! " " Well , I guess I better be going , " Fauna said unhappily . She put the teacup on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , and crawled to the firedoor . " Give me a boost through , will you , Suzy ? " Suzy stuffed her through the opening the way you 'd stuff a sausage . And then she called , " Fauna ! " Fauna put her head in through the door . " You been the best friend I ever had . If I 'm tough , it ai n't at you , it 's at me . I was always mad at everybody . Turns out it was me I was mad at . When I get friends with myself , maybe I can get friends with somebody without no chip . " Fauna said , " S'pose Doc come a-begging ? " " I ai n't no mantrap , " said Suzy . " I would n't have him if he come walking on his hands . You ca n't cure a sock in the puss with a sock in the puss . But if ever I like a guy again , and he lays it on the line , why , I 'm going to have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss you , Suzy . " " I 'll be back when I 'm right . I love you . " " Oh , shut up ! " said Fauna . And she clanged the firedoor shut.  |p211Of  all our murky inventions , guilt is at once the most devious , the most comic , the most painful . Was it planted by the group pressure of the tribe to keep the potentially dangerous individual off balance ? Is it set in the psycho tissue , watered and cultivated by ductless glands ? Is guilt the unconscious device by which a man cries for attention in an unperceiving world , or can it be that the final human pleasure is pain ? Whatever its origin , we scream like cats in copulation , wolf-bay the moon , whip ourselves with the exquisite thorns of contempt , and generally have a hell of a good time at it . In the pleasures and passions of guilt , Hazel should have been voted the human least likely to succeed . Guilt is a selfish pastime and Hazel had never been aware enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small boy watches a train go by  --  mouth open , breathing high and light , pleased , astonished , and a little confused . Hazel had never amounted to a damn . Mack once describedHazel 's education : " He done four years in grammar school and four years in reform school  --  and he did n't learn nothing either place . " Reform school , you see , where vice and crime are not a ' extracurricular , failed to have any more effect on Hazel than the fourth grade had . He came out as innocent as he  |p212had  gone in . Hazel did n't pay enough attention to be evil . If Mack and the boys and Doc had n't been his friends , there 's no telling what might have happened to him . Hazel thought Mack was the world 's greatest human , while Doc he did n't consider human at all . Sometimes he said his prayers to Doc . But Hazel was changing . Imperceptibly he had begun to pay attention . Perhaps Fauna had planted the germ by readingHazel 's horoscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should in itself have been suspicious . Hazel did not want to be President of the United States . If there had been any avenue of escape he would have taken it , but his horoscope closed all doors . When a man is finally boxed and he has no choice , he begins to decorate his box . So Hazel , condemned to the presidency , since he could not escape it , began to ornament it . A man can climb high on the steps of responsibility . Hazel began to prepare himself for the time when his call should come . He read every word of a copy of Time magazine , then went back to the beginning and read it again . He thought about it a great deal and came to the conclusion that it was nuts  --  which proves that Hazel 's problem had been inattention , not unintelligence . He bought a World Almanac and read the lives of the Presidents , and he began to wonder what he would do if the British impressed our sailors or the " Fifty-four-Forty " issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it made him sick . Sometimesin the morning he would awaken happy in the thought that it was a bad dream . Then he would count his toes and relapse into acceptance of his fate and his duty.  |p213What  made it worst of all was the loneliness . He could n't discuss it with anyone . He was set apart and above ordinary experience . When he had offered to fight Mack it was not in anger . He was preparing to defend the weak . When he had flown in the face of his friends , and refused to be a dwarf , and insisted on being Prince Charming , Hazel was not being vain . The dignity of his position was greater than himself . He could not let his future down . In an ordinary time one of the boys would have noticed Hazel 's suffering face , the weariness , the pained nobility , and they would have given him two tablespoons of Epsom salts . But in these times all men 's souls were being tried , and women 's too , and a tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out what had happened at the masquerade were fruitless . He remembered how he had been dignified and beautiful and then all hell had broken loose . And the aftermath was horrible . The spirit of the Palace Flophouse , tested under the torques and stresses of so many years , was broken , shattered like granite , which withstands so long the hammer blows , then suddenly disintegrates . Mack , who considered life hardly worse than a bad cold , was sickened to death  --  his eyes were lackluster and his valiant soul was shot . And if Mack was that way , you can imagine what the boys were like  --  jellyfish washed up on an inhospitable shore . " What happened ? " Hazel asked , and eyes glanced at him and glanced away and no one had the will to explain . For several days Hazel thought it might be the bull-bitch hangover of all time , but it continued into the day of reviv/ing thirst and there was no thirst . Hazel began to be afraid for his friends . He sat under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject , he actually thought about it . It was a time for greatness , and only Hazel had the strength to rise to that bright bait . When he stood up and brushed the cypress dirt from his jeans , he had completed the change . No longer was he Hazel the Innocent , Hazel the Unaware , Hazel the Dope . His shoulders squared to take the weight , and the calm beauty of strength shone from his eyes . It was dusky in the Palace , moldy and sad . The boys lay on their beds , listless and ruined . Mack stared up at his canopy , and he was the worst of all , for there was no expression in his face . He had not crashed in flames , he was eroding away . When Hazel sat down quietly on the side of his bed Mack did n't even take a kick at him , although his shoes were on . Hazel said , " Mack , Mack darling , you should shake the lead out of your pants now . " Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tears squeezed out and hung there until they dried . Hazel said gently , " Mack , you want I should kick the hell out of you ? " Mack moved his head quietly back and forth in negation . Hazel did not hold back . He threw his trump card in , and the hell with it . " I been over to Doe 's , " he said . " He 's setting there with a pencil in his hand . He ai n't wrote nothing . He ai n't done nothing . He ai n't thought nothing . Get off your behind , Mack , he needs us. "  |p215Mack  spoke sepulchrally . " He needs us like a muddauber'snest up his pants leg . Do n't blame me , Hazel . I ca n't fight back no more . I 'm down for the count . " " What 's happened , Mack ? " Mack 's voice was hollow . " When we done it before we wrecked his joint and busted him , but that was mere chaff . " " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was things busted  --  glass , records , dishes , books , stuff like that . But this time we 've put a knife in his belly . If you keep trying to pat a guy on the head and instead you knock his brains out , you lose confidence . " He sighed and turned over and covered his face with his arms . " You ai n't got the right to give up , " Hazel said . " I got the right to do any goddam thing I want . " " Now that sounds better ! " " Or not do nothing , " said Mack . " Look , Doc got to go to La Jolla , you know that . He got to make the spring tides next week . Then , when his new microscope comes , he 'll have devilfish and write his paper . We got to help him , Mack . " " Fauna says she used to manage a welterweight nameof Kiss of Death Kelly . That 's me  --  Kiss of Death Mack . Everything I touch withers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I wo n't , " said Mack . " Get up , I tell you ! " Mack did n't even respond . Hazel went outside and looked around . He walked to ap216broken tar barrel lying in the weeds and pulled out a curved oaken stave . He went back and stood beside Mack 's bed . He judged distance and lift . He hit Mack so hard that his pants split . And only then did Hazel realize how serious it was , for Mack did n't even move . He only groaned . Hazel fought down panic , and then he remembered his Fate  --  a sacrifice to Washington where he would have to eat oysters . " All right , Mack , " he said softly . " I 'll have to do her myself . " He turned and walked out of the door with quiet dignity . Mack rolled up on one elbow . " Did you hear what that crazy bastard said ? Oh , what the hell ! Ca n't do no worse than I done . Mother , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death and I fain would lie down . " " You 're already down , " said Whitey No. 2 . When people change direction it is a rare one who does not spend the first half of his journey looking back over his shoulder . Hazel had chosen , or had been forced to choose , a new path . He had said , " I 'll have to do her myself . " It had seemed easy . But , sitting under the sheltering branches of the black cypress tree , he had to admit he did n't know who or what in the hell " she " was . He thoughtp217with longing of the old time when he was a dope , when he was cared for and thought for and loved . He had paid off , of course , by accepting ridicule , but it had been a lovely time , a warm time . Doc had said long ago , " I like to have you sit with me , Hazel . You are the well  --  the original well . A man can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . And if you did , it would n't make any difference because you do n't pay attention . Why , you 're better than a well because you listen  --  but you do n't hear . You are a priest without penalties , an analyst without diagnosis . " Those were the good days before Hazel 's responsibility . But responsibility required judgment , the choosing between courses , and what was that but thought ? Hazel undertook thought , but he did it secretly . No one knew . He was a little ashamed of it . In the sweet old days he would have sat down under the black cypress and then he would have reclinedwith his head on his arm and in less than a minute he would have been asleep . The new Hazel clasped his knees with his arms and mourned into the future . His mind climbed and slipped like an ant in the treacherous crater of an ant lion 's trap . He must plan , he must judge , he must choose . No sleep came . He did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she ? He never knew how his solution came to him . He dropped off to sleep , forehead on knees , then suddenly his muscles leaped as though under a blow . He had a sense of falling  --  and there was his course laid out before him . It was n't an honorable course , but it was the only one he had . It almost amounted to treachery . You will remember that it was Hazel 's pleasant social custom to ask questions but not to listen to the answers.  |p218Peo|ple  expected that , depended on it . Suppose , he thought , I was to ask and then listen but not let on I 'm listening . It was sneaky , but the intention was clean and the end infinitelyto be desired . He would not only listen , he would remember , and he would put all the answers together . Maybe then he would be able to think her and do her . One question would be enough , he thought . Maybe two . Hazel was weary from his effort . He reclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good sleep of work well done . Joe Elegant came cautiously back from his journey ready to take another one at a moment 's notice . He expectedreprisals for Hazel 's costume , and there were no reprisals . In gratitude he made popovers at the Bear Flag three evenings in a row  --  and the girls did n't even know what they were eating . He wanted to know what had happenedbut he was afraid to ask . Thus Joe Elegant was glad when Hazel called on him in his little lean-to in the rear of the Bear Flag . " Sit here , " he said . " I 'll get you a piece of cake . " While he was gone Hazel regarded the works of Henri the artist on the wall  --  one from the chicken-feather period and one from the later nutshell time . And he looked at the card table on which Joe Elegant worked at a portablep219typewriter . There was a neat pile of manuscript on the table , green paper typed with a green ribbon . A sheet of paper was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , It was sweet of you  --  " Joe came back with a wedge of cake and a glass of milk for Hazel , and while Hazel munched and drank , Joe 's large damp eyes bracketed him but never hit him . " How 'd it go ? " he asked . " What ? " " Why , your costume ? " " Fine , fine . Everybody was real surprised . " " I 'll bet they were . Did Mack say anything ? " " He said I done fine . He almost cried . " Joe Elegant smiled with quiet malice . Hazel asked vacuously , " Say , what would you think was the matter with Doc ? " Joe crossed his legs professionally and his fingers rippled through the green-typed green pages . " It 's the whole and the part and the part is the whole , " he said . " Come again ? " " It 's many things and one thing . Doc 's libido is driving him one way and his conscience is pulling him another . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide , and he relates to it by collecting animals . He carries his treasures to his laboratory . He wants to hide them and perhaps to place the dragon Fafnir on guard . " Hazel nearly said , " He sells them , " but that would have given him away as listening . " I knew a dame named Fafnir , " he said . " Bertha Fafnir . Third grade . Used to do pitchers of turkeys on the blackboard Thanksgiving . Had starched underskirts , they rustled kind of . "  |p220Joe  Elegant scowled faintly at the interruption . " Distill the myth and you get the symbol , " he went on . " The symbolis the paper he wants to write , but that in itself has impurities , needs distillation . Why ? Because it is a substitute , that 's why . His symbol is false . That 's why he ca n't write his paper . Frustration ! He has taken the wrong path . And so he brings in false solutions . I need a microscope , ' he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides . ' He will not go to La Jolla . He will never write his paper . " " Why not ? " " Wrong symbol . We must go back to the myth , the sea . The sea is his mother . His mother is dead but she is living . He is carrying treasures from his mother 's womb and trying to save them . Do you understand ? " " Sure , " said Hazel listlessly . " He needs love . He needs understanding , " said Joe Elegant . " Who do n't ? " Hazel asked . " I feel that I could help him if he would let me. " " 1 kind of thought he 'd took a shine to Suzy , " said Hazel . Joe Elegant let a shadow of distaste tighten his mouth . " That would only be a new false path , a new frustration . " Hazel observed , " Some people like one thing , someanother . " " Very original ! " said Joe Elegant . It was only a few steps from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room . In the Ready Room sat Becky with her feet up , reading her mail . Becky subscribed to " Pen Pals " and had a lively correspondence all over the world . The sheet of rice paper in her handsp221was from japan . " Dear Pen Pal , " it began , " Your interest missive receipt . How gondola the Goldy State . Japan girl do hair-kink likewise , but not using blitch . My friend , Mitzi Mitzuki very West in minded . Would try if you mailing small little container hydrogen peroxide double pressure . " " Hi ! " said Hazel . Becky laid down her letter . " Ever been to Japan ? " " Nope . " " Me neither . How 's Mack ? " " Fine . Say , Becky , what would you say was the matter with Doc ? " " Love , " said Becky . " Doc 's aching away . Or if he ai n't , he ought to be . Nice fella like that . " " He sets like he been pole-axed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was me , why , I 'd go to him and I 'd put my cool hand on his brow and I 'd say , Doc  --  ' " The door of Fauna 's room opened . " I thought I heard voices . Hello , Hazel . Ai n't none of the other girls around ? Becky 's poorly . " " I come to ask you something , " said Hazel . " Well , come on in here . Set down . Want a snort ? Is it private ? I 'll shut the door . " " Yes , " said Hazel , and that covered all the questions . The snort brightened his eye . " What would you say was wrong with Doc ? " " I would n't of said it a while ago , " said Fauna , " but when he put on that tie  --  and then , the other night  --  " " Hell , he was drunk , " said Hazel . " A guy will say anythingwhen he 's drunk . " " No , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Suzy ? " " Yes , sir ! And if she was n't nuts , she could go to La Jolla with him and help him work . Why , hell ! She 'd be in . " " He 's trying to write his paper . " " He got himself all bollixed up , " said Fauna . " I bet he ai n't even thinking about his paper . " " He ai n't thinking about nothing . " " That 's what I mean . If he could stop not thinking about Suzy , why , he could start thinking about his paper . That 's my opinion anyway . " " You think if she went to La Jolla  --  ? " " I do . But she wo n't go . " " He would n't take her , " said Hazel . " If everybody was n't such damn fools he would n't get asked , " said Fauna . " I do n't know what we 're coming to . Have one more snort ? " " I ca n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was only a coincidence that Joseph and Mary Rivas was also reading a letter when Hazel entered the grocery . Joseph and Mary was reading and cursing at the same time , cursing in obscure Spanish . The letter was from James Petrillo , and it spoke in no uncertain terms . If the threat in the letter could be carried out , it looked as though what the U. S. government could not do in keeping wetbacks out , the musicians ' union could . The Patron was in a stew . Ordinarily what he could not eliminate he joined . But Petrillo did not give him that choice . Joseph and Mary 's mind strayed toward assassination . Hazel said , " How 're you ? " " Lousy ! " said the Patron.  | " Ai n't nobody feeling too good , " Hazel observed . " Doc 's setting over there like he 's punch-drunk . What you think 's the matter with him ? " " Christ knows ! " said the Patron . " I got troubles of my own . Funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night I was coming home from Monterey , late , and there was a shadow up in the vacant lot . It moved into that bright spot the street light throws up by the boiler , and I swear to God it was Doc sneaking around up there . " " No ! " said Hazel . " I say yes . " The Patron looked over the vegetables and the piled canned goods and his eyes dwelt on the cardboard Coca-Cola girl in a swing . " Know something ? " he said speculatively . " Before the party I would have said she was just one more tramp . Then she belted loose and moved into the boiler . And then , well  --  it looks like Doc seen something there . Maybe Suzy 's got something I missed . I been thinking I might just take a whack at her . " " You ca n't , " said Hazel . " She 's Doc 's . " " Hell , " said the Patron , " dames do n't belong to nobody . I might just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no windows , " said Hazel . The Patron smiled . Petrillo 's poison was going out of him . " Yes , sir ! " he said . " Maybe I missed something . " " You stay away from her , " said Hazel . Joseph and Mary drooped his eyes , and an Indian looked out for a second . Then he smiled again . " Have it your own way , " he said lightly . " I hear she 's got a job . " This was the Golden Poppy : long , narrow , high-ceilinged ; small octagonal tiles on the floor ; dark wood counterp224with small round stools ; units at intervals on the counterjuke-boxslot , paper-napkin holder , salt , pepper , sugar , mustard , catsup ; rear door to the kitchen with window and service shelf ; cash register at the front , cigarette machinebeside the door ; long mirror behind the counter fronted by coffee maker , griddle , toasters , covered cakes and pies , stacked breakfast foods , doughnuts , rack of canned soup and soup heater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing to be done about the Golden Poppy . It was a dour and gloomy place dedicated to good coffee and sad , soggy food . It could not compete with the gay and phony little restaurants springing up in Monterey , with their checked tablecloths , showcard murals , low ceilings , and candles in cork floats . The Golden Poppy did not try . There were many people who preferred it to the newcomers  --  customers who liked cold , damp doughnuts , stringy stews , and canned soup . These diners distrusted fishnets on the walls and jokes on the menu . To them food was a necessary but solemn sacrament about which there should be no nonsense . The rush hours were seven to eight-thirty , breakfast ; eleven-thirty to one-thirty , lunch ; six to eight , dinner . In between these hours there were the coffee customers , the sandwich and doughnut people . In the evening came two rush times : at nine-thirty when the early movie let out , and at eleven-thirty when the second show broke . At twelve-thirty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it stayed open until two for the early drunks . The coming of Suzy to the Golden Poppy had a curiousp225but reasonable effect on Ella . She had , over the years , maintained an iron interdict against weariness and pain . If she had allowed herself to realize how miserable she was she would have cut her throat . Suzy did more than help , she took over : joked with the salesmen , whistled over the sandwich toaster , remembered that Mr. Garrigas liked cream of celery soup and remembered his name too . For a day or so Ella had watched Suzy and refused acidly when Suzy suggested that she go home and lie down for a couple of hours . Then her interdict cracked , and the crack widened . Abysmal fatigue , aching legs , and abdominal pains crept through . Ella was an exhausted woman when she came at last to admit it . Going home to lie down for an hour was first a sin , and then a luxury , and finally a drug . Now when Suzy said after the nine-thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's sleep , " it seemed perfectly natural . Not only could Suzy hold the fort , but her terse , professional gaiety was drawing in new customers . At eleven-fifteen Suzy had the four Silexes filled with fresh coffee , the hamburgers between waxed paper in the icebox , the tomatoes sliced , and the sandwich bread in the drawer below the griddle . At eleven-thirty the customerscame in a rush from the second show . Suzy grew six extra hands : club sandwiches , melted cheese sandwiches , cheeseburgers , and coffee , coffee , coffee ! The cash register jangled and the change appeared standing up between the tits of the rubber mat . " How 's about a date Saturday ? " " Sure ! Love to . "  | " Is it a date ? " " Can my husband come ? " " You married ? " " I wo n't be if 1 keep that date . " " You 're a swell-looking kid . " " You 're kind of pretty yourself . Here 's your change . " " Keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighty-six on the tuna fish sandwiches . " In the seconds between orders , three of her extra hands crashed dishes into the soapy water , rinsed and dried them . " Hey ! Mr. Gelthain , you forgot your umbrella ! " " So I did . Thank you . " That would be another quartertip , and the quarter went into a slotted can marked " Joe . " Every morning when Joe Blaikey came in for his coffee a little pile of silver was put before him and checked in the account book . It was amazing how it added up . At five minutes of twelve Hazel came in and waited against the wall until a stool was vacant . " Hi , Hazel . What 'll it be ? " " Cup of coffee . " " It 's on the house , Hazel . How you been ? " " Okay . " Gradually the customers thinned out and then were gone . Suzy 's flashing hands put the Golden Poppy to bed : scrubbed the grill , washed down the counter , wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Hazel sweeping out . " Say , what the hell are you doing ? "  | " I figured we 're both going the same way . I 'll walk with you. , , " Whv not ? " said Suzy . " You can carry my books . " " What ? " " Just a joke . " " Ha , ha ! " said Hazel seriously . They walked down Alvarado Street , all closed up exceptwhere the bars splashed neon culture on the sidewalk . At the tip of the Presidio they stopped and leaned their elbows on the iron railing and looked at the fishing boats in the black water of the bay . They crossed the tracks , went past the Army warehouse , and entered the upper end of Cannery Row . And at last Hazel said , " You 're a swell dame . " " Come again ? " " Say , what you think 's the matter with Doc ? " " How would I know ? " " You sore at him ? " " How 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , " said Hazel quickly . " I ai n't bright . Everybodyknows that . " " What 's that got to do with keeping out of my hair ? " " Nobody pays no attention to me , " said Hazel . He offeredthis as a recommendation . " Doc says I do n't listen . He likes that . " They walked on in silence for a while . Then Hazel said timidly , " He done everything in the world for me . Once he went character witness for me and I ai n't got no character . Once I 'd of lost a foot , but he opened her up and shook powder on her and I still got her . "  |p228Suzy  did n't answer . Their footsteps were loud on the pavement and echoed back from the iron fronts of dead canneries . " Doc 's in trouble , " Hazel said . Their footsteps filled the street . " Anybody in trouble , why , they go to Doc . Nobody goes to him now he 's in trouble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him , " said Hazel . " But I ai n't bright . " " What the hell do you want me to do ? " said Suzy . " Well , could n't you go over and set with him ? " " No . " " If you was in trouble he 'd help you . " " I ai n't in trouble . How do you know he 's in trouble ? " " I 'm telling you . I thought you liked him . " " I like him all right . If he was in real trouble like if he was sick or bust his leg , I 'd probably take him some soup . " " Jeeze ! If he bust his leg he could n't go to the spring tides , " said Hazel . " Well , he ai n't busted his leg . " They passed Wide Ida 's . Hazel asked , " You want a beer ? " " No , thanks . " Then she said , " Ai n't you going up to the Palace ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a guy . " Suzy said , " Once , when I was a kid , I made an ashtray for my old man and old lady  --  " " They like it ? " " They did n't need no ashtray . " " Did n't they smoke ? " " Yes , " said Suzy . " Good night . "  |p229Hazel  was approaching a state of collapse . In his whole life he had never sustained a thought for more than two minutes . Now his resources reeled under the strain of four hours of concentration . And it was not yet over . He had to make two more visits , and then he had to retire under the black cypress tree to sift his findings . So far he could see no light anywhere . His mental pictures were like those children 's kaleidoscopes that change color and design as they are turned . It seemed to Hazel that a slight zizzing sound came from his brain . It was a catty night . Big toms crept about , their heads and shoulders flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preened themselves in sweet innocence , unaware of what they hoped was likely to happen to them . On the rocks off Hopkins Marine Station the sea lions barked with a houndish quaver . The silver canneries were silent under the street lights . And from somewhere on the beach Cacahuete Rivas 's trumpet softly mourned the " Memphis Blues . " Hazel had stopped for a moment in appreciation of the secret night . He looked up at the boiler where Suzy had gone , and into the streak of street light he saw a figure move . From the shape and posture he thought it must be the Patron . In a way it was none of Hazel 's business . He walked up the stairs and knocked on the door of Western Biological . Doc sat on his bed regarding a heap of collecting paraphernalia : nets , buckets and jars , formaldehyde and Epsomsalts and menthol , rubber boots and rubber gloves ,  |p230glass  plates and string . On his table stood a small new traveling aquarium with a tiny pump and motor run by two dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles sift through the sea water . " Come in , " he said to Hazel . " I 'm glad to see you . " " Just come to pass the time of day , " said Hazel . " Good . I 'm glad . A man feels silly talking to himself , and at the same time it 's private . You 're the perfect answer , Hazel . " . " Say , Doc , I just remembered . " What 's ass  --  astro-physic ? " " You do n't really want me to tell you , do you ? " " Not very much . I just wondered . I signed up for it . " Doc shuddered . " I do n't think I want to hear about that , " he said . " I brang you a pint . " " That 's friendly of you . Will you join me ? " " Sure , " said Hazel . " You 're really going to La Jolla , huh ? " " Well , I guess 1 have to . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out . I 've made such a stink about it . " " Lot of people think you wo n't go . " " Well , that 's one of the reasons I have to . " " Do n't you want to ? " " I do n't know , " said Doc softly . He got up from the bed and disengaged a wire from the dry cell . " No point in wasting juice , " he said . " I 've been tearing myself down like a Model T Ford in a backyard . Got the pieces all laid out . Still do n't know why it wo n't run . Do n't even know whether I can get it together again . " " I could help , " said Hazel . " I know about Model T's. "  | " It might turn out you know about people too , " said Doc . Hazel looked shyly down at his feet . No one had ever accused him of knowing anything before . Doc chuckled . " That 's my good Hazel ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with you ? " Hazel was appalled at his daring , but he had asked . And Doc seemed to find the question reasonable . " God knows , " he said . " Some kind of obscure self-justification , I guess . I wanted to make a contribution to learning . Maybe that was a substitution for fathering children . Right now , my contribution , even if it came off , seems kind of weak . I think maybe I 've talked myself into something , and now maybe I have to do it . " Hazel groped among his bits and pieces . " Mack 's sorry about what him and Fauna done . He 's just sick . " " He should n't be , " said Doc . " I 'm the one who messed it up . " " You mean you would of took Suzy on ? " " 1 guess so . I 've thought about it ever since . For a couple of days there I felt different and better than I ever have in my life . A kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " About Suzy ? " " I guess so . I 'm supposed to have this wild free brain without conventional barriers . And what did I do ? I balanceda nasty ledger . I weighed education , experience , background , even probable blood lines . Some of the worst people I ever knew had the best of all those . Well , there it is . Saying it has made it even clearer . I guess I 've thrown it away . " " Why do n't you give it one more try , Doc ? "  | " How ? " " Why do n't you take a candy bar or a bunch of carnationsand knock on her door ? " " Right from the beginning , huh ? Sounds kind of silly . " " Well , dames is all dame , " said Hazel . " You may have made a discovery . Have you seen her ? " " Yeah . She got that boiler fixed up real pretty . She got a job down at the Golden Poppy . " " How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about again among his broken pieces . Her vehemence came back to him . " When she was a kid she made an ashtray for her papa and mama  --  " Hazel let it hang there because it sounded ridiculous . " Well , what about it ? " " They did n't need no ashtray , " said Hazel . " She told you that ? " " Yep . " " Let 's have a drink . " " I ca n't , Doc . I got one more  --  I mean , I got to see a guy . " " This late at night ? " " Yeah . " And then Hazel confessed . " You been good to me , Doc . I would n't do no bad thing to you . " " Of course you would n't . " " But I done it . " " What ! " " Remember you always said you liked me ' cause I did n't listen ? " " Sure I remember . " Hazel 's eyes were shy and ashamed . " I listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Doc  --  " " Yes ? " " Joseph and Mary 's hanging around the boiler . " Hazel could n't remember ever having been so tired . He had put his mind to unaccustomed tricks , and it was just as he had been afraid it would be . He had got nothing . He had started out hoping to find some kind of light to guide him . What he had got reminded him of Henri 's painting in nutshells . He wanted to sleep a long time , perhaps never to awaken to a world in which he now felt himself a stranger . He had made a mess of it . He wondered if he would make as bad a mess in Washington . He walked wearily through the vacant lot and up the chicken walk to the Palace Flophouse . He wanted to slip into bed in the dark and hide his failure in sleep . Mack and the boys were waiting up for him . " Where the hell you been ? " said Mack . " We looked all over for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel listlessly . Mack moved and groaned . " Jesus ! You hit me a crack , " he said . " Damn near killed me . " " I should n't of did it , " said Hazel . " You want I should rub it ? " " Hell no ! What you been up to ? When you get makingplans , the sky is falling on my tail , said Henny Penny . " Whitey No. 2 asked , " Who you been with ? " " Everybody . Just walking around . " " Well , who ? "  | " Oh , Joe Elegant and Fauna and Suzy and Doc . " " You seen Suzy ? " Mack demanded . " Sure . Went down to the Poppy for a cup of coffee . " " Look who 's buying coffee ! " " It was on the house , " said Hazel . " Well , what did she say ? " " She says in the third grade she made an ashtray . " " Oh , Jesus ! " said Mack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I guess so . " " You guess so ! " " Do n't ask me if you 're going to be mean to me . That 'll just get me mean . " Mack shifted painfully to his other buttock . Hazel felt ringed with hostility . " I guess I 'll go outside , " he said miserably . " Wait ! What 'd she say about Doc ? " " Said she did n't want no part of him , except  --  I 'm going to go on out . " " Except what ? " " Except he got sick or bust a leg . " Mack shook his head . " Sometimes you get me thinking the way you do . God Almighty ! I should n't of let you out alone . " " I did n't do no harm . " " I bet you did n't do no good neither . I bet right now you 're trying to figure out germ warfare  --  how to get Doc sick . " " I 'm tired , " said Hazel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's stopping you ? " Hazel did n't even take off his clothes before he went top235bed , but he did n't sleep either ; at least not until the dawn crept out from Salinas . His brain was blistered and his responsibility rode him with surcingle and spurs . Doc sat for a long time after Hazel left him . His chest rustled with feeling and his throat was dry . His top mind looked at him  --  a scientist , a thinker trained , conditioned to method , to exactness . No single thing could be permitted in unless it could be measured or tasted or heard or seen . The laws of science were Doc 's laws , and he sought to obey them . To break these laws was not only a sin to him but a danger , for violation would let in anarchy . He was frightened and cold . His middle mind screamed with joy at his discomfiture . " I told you ! All through the years I 've told you you were fooling yourself . Let 's see you get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in his entrails was busy too , aching and yet singing that the ache was necessary and good . Middle mind had its way . Doc thought , Let 's look at this . Here is a man with work to do . The girl  --  what is she ? Let 's suppose every good thing should come of a relationship with her . It still would be no good . There is no possible way for this girl and me to be successful  --  nop236way under the sun . Not only is she illiterate , but she has a violent temper . She has all of the convictions of the uninformed . She is sure of things she has not investigated , not only sure for herself , but sure for everyone . In two months she will become a prude . Then where will freedom go ? Your thinking will be like tennis against a bad player . Let 's stop this nonsense ! Forget it ! You ca n't have it and you do n't want it . Middle mind hooted , " You ca n't not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take a feel of your pulse , listen to your pounding heart . Why ? You just heard the iron door of the boiler clang , that 's why . You have n't even thought what that means yet , but you 've got a pain in your gut because of that clang and because it 's three-thirteenin the morning . " Low mind said , " Nothing 's bad . It 's all part of one thing  --  the good and bad . Do you know any man and woman  --  no matter how close  --  who do n't have good and bad ? Let me out ! Or , by God , I 'll set my claws in you and I 'll tear at you for all your life ! Let me out , I say ! Feel this , this red burning ? That 's rage . Will you let it out or will it fester here until it makes you sick and crazy ? Look at the time . You heard that iron door . " Doc looked at his watch  --  3:17 . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his light and went to the window and looked out toward the strip of light the street lamp threw on the vacant lot . Then he opened his front door and crept down the stairs . Crossing the street , he followed a broad shadow and hid in it . The Patron was sitting on a big rusty pipe trying to work out a puzzle . He had it laid out and the pieces did n't makep237sense . Here was himself , young , good-looking , snappy dresser , and making dough . And here was a dame , a dimea-dozendame , living in a boiler , working for her keep . The Patron knew methods too , and , if not scientific , they had served him well enough so that he could depend on them . You sweet talk , you promise , you offer , and in reserve you always hold force . Every dame needs a little force . He felt the swelling knuckles of his right hand . This dame was nuts . She did n't listen to his pitch , and when he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his fingers off . He was going to lose the nails of all four fingers . The dirty bitch ! Thus , musing bitterly , he did not hear Doc 's approach . Doc 's fingers locked in the collar of the Patron 's striped shirt and yanked him to his feet . By reflex the Patron lashed out with his foot and kicked Doc 's legs from under him . The two fell together and rolled in the mallow weeds . Joseph and Mary tried for the groin with his knee , while Doc 's delicate strong fingers laced around the throat . The Patron felt the thumbs seeking the hollow below his Adam 's apple . He tore at the white face with his fingers and Doc 's thumbs went home . Flaring lights whirled in the Patron 's eyes and his brain turned red . He knew that in two seconds his thorax would collapse under the thumbs and he would be dead . He had seen it happen . He knew it and , so knowing , he went limp and in sweating terror felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickened mind figured the chances  --  the groin again or butt of head to chin ? But if he missed the terrible thumbs would come again . He was weak and afraid  --  afraid even to speak for fear the wrongp238word might draw the seeking thumbs . " Doc , " he whispered , " I give up . You got me . " " Go near that girl again and I 'll tear your throat out , " Doc whispered back . " I wo n't . I swear to God I wo n't . " In the grocery under the seven-watt light , the Patron tried to get the cork out of a pint with his mashed fingers but had to pass the bottle to Doc . Doc felt the sickness that follows rage  --  and he also felt silly . He took a gulp of whisky and passed the bottle over the counter . Joseph and Mary drank and then bent over , coughing and spluttering . Doc had to run around the counter to beat him on the back . When he could speak , Joseph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand it , " he said . " Where 'd you learn that trick ? What 'd you want to do it for ? You might of killed me . " " I guess I wanted to , " said Doc . " I must have wanted to . " He laughed embarrassedly . " I thought you were making a pass at Suzy . " " I was , " said Joseph and Mary . " Jesus , Doc , I did n't know you was that way with her . " " I 'm not , " said Doc . " Give me a drink . " " You was n't playing tiddlywinks , " said Joseph and Mary . " Now do n't get excited . She give me the bum 's rush . Hell , she damn near took off my fingers with that door . You ai n't got any competition from me , Doc . She 's all yours . " " She wo n't even see me , " said Doc . " Wo n't ? What in hell is the matter with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their elbows on the counter and faced each other . " Beats me , " said Joseph and Mary . " What you going to do ? " Doc smiled . " Hazel said take her flowers and a candy bar . " " He might have something there . I ca n't figure her . " Gingerly the Patron let a little whisky dribble down his throat and winced as it passed the bruised place . " I guess she 's just nuts , " he said . " And if she 's nuts , a guy 's got to do nuts things . You do n't think you could say the hell with her ? " " I have , over and over . " " Do n't do no good ? " " Not a bit . I know it 's damn foolishness , but there it is . " " I knew guys like that . There ai n't nothing to do about it , I guess . " His eyes sharpened . " 1 remember something , " he said . " When I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I find a guy that 's up to his eyes I 'll dive in , ' she says . And I says , For Doc ? ' Hell no ! ' she says . He 's sliced like package bacon . ' " " I guess she 's right , " said Doc . " That ai n't what I was thinking . Look , Doc , when you had the hooks in me , if I 'd went on  --  well , would you of ? " " I guess so . I can hardly believe it of myself , but I guess I would have . I never did anything like that before . Why ? " " Well , I just thought  --  a guy that 'll do a killing with his hands ai n't sliced too thin . Let 's finish the pint , Doc , and then I 'll help you . "  | " Help me what ? " " Flowers , " said Joseph and Mary . " We got an hour before daylight . Up above Lighthouse Avenue there 's front yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cook at the Bear Flag , not the bouncer , with the result that his services were never requiredlate at night . He retired early and set his alarm clock for four . This gave him three or four hours every morning over his portable to tap out green letters on green paper . The book was going well . His hero had been born in a state of shock and nothing subsequent had reassured him . When a symbol was n't slapping him in the mouth , a myth was kicking his feet out from under him . It was a book of moods , of dank rooms with cryptic wallpaper , of pale odors , of decaying dreams . There was n't a character in the whole of The Pi Root of Oedipus who would n't have made the observation ward . The hero had elderly aunts beside whom the Marquis de Sade was an altar boy . The pile of green manuscript was three inches thick , and Joe Elegant was beginning to plan his photograph for the back of the dust cover : open collar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one hand relaxed in front of him with an open poison ring on the third finger . He knew which re/viewers he could depend on and why . He typed : " A pool scummed with Azolla . In the open water in the middle of the pond a dead fish floated belly up ... " Joe Elegant sighed , leaned back , and scratched his stomach . He yawned , went into the Bear Flag 's kitchen , and started a pot of coffee . While it was heating he walked out into a glorious morning . The pelicans were drumming in for a run of tom cod , and little pink Kleenex clouds hung over the bay . Joe saw the flowers in front of the boiler door and moved over to inspect them  --  a huge bouquet of tulips , early roses , jonquils , and iris . They might have been anyone 's offering , except that their stems were in a museum jar . Joe Elegant 's life had not been in danger since the engagementand raffle party , but he had n't felt much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bear Flag and served it to Fauna on a tray along with her coffee and crullers . By eight o'clock the news was in the Palace Flophouse , and the early men were ingesting it with their whisky sours at the La Ida . The best seats were in the Ready Room with its windowsoverlooking the vacant lot . Mack was there behind a drape , munching Fauna 's crullers . The girls were there in their best kimonos . Becky had put on her mules with the ostrich feathers . At eight-thirty the audience heard the boiler door screech and shushed one another . Suzy , on her hands and knees , poked her head out of the firedoor and rammed her nose into the giant floral tribute . For a long moment she stared at the flowers , and then she reached out and dragged them inside . The iron door closed after her.  |p242At  nine o'clock Suzy re-emerged and walked rapidly toward Monterey . At nine-thirty she was back . She went into the boiler and in a moment came out , pushing her suitcase ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for a moment . Suzy climbed the steps and rang the bell at the Bear Flag . Fauna chased the girls to their rooms and Mack out the back way before she answered the door . Suzy said , " You told me I could use your bathroom . " Help yourself , " said Fauna . In an hour , when the splashing had ceased , Fauna knocked on the bathroom door . " Want a little toilet water , . honey ? " " Thanks , " said Suzy . In a few minutes she emerged , scrubbed and shining . " Like a cup of coffee ? " Fauna asked . " Wish I could , " said Suzy . " I got to run . Thanks for the bath . There ai n't nothing like a good deep-dish setdownbath . " Fauna , from behind a drape , watched her crawl back into the boiler . In her office bedroom Fauna scribbled a note and sent it by Joe Elegant to Western Biological . It read : " She ai n't going to work today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were pale acid spots on the washed khaki trousers , the white shirt was yellow with age , and he noticed for the first time that his old tweed jacket was frayed through at both elbows . The tie he had worn to the dinner at Sonny Boy 's was spotted . He found a black army tie in the bottom of his suitcase . For the first time in his life he was dissatisfied with his clothing . It was silly to feel serious about it , but there was no doubt that he was serious . For a time he sat down and regarded his wardrobe and his life , and he found them both ridiculous . And not less ridiculous was the quaking certainty that he was frightened . He spoke aloud to the rattlesnakes , and they ran out their forked tongues to listen . " You are looking at a fool , " he said . " I am a reasonable man , a comparatively intelligent man  --  IQ one hundred and eighty-two , University of Chicago , Master 's and Ph.D . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other fields . Regard this man ! " he said . " He is about to pay a formal call on a girl in a boiler . He has a halfpoundbox of chocolates for her . This man is scared stiff . Why ? I 'll tell you why . He is afraid this girl will notp244approve of him . He is terrified of her . He knows this is funny , but he can not laugh at it . " The eyes of the snakes looked dustily at him  --  or seemed to . Doc went on , " Let me put it this way : there is nothing I can do . They say of an amputee that he remembers his leg . Well , I remember this girl . I am not whole without her I am not alive without her . When she was with me I was more alive than I have ever been , and not only when she was pleasant either . Even when we were fighting I w-as whole . At the time I did n't realize how important it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know that if I should win her I 'll have many horrible times . Over and over , I 'll wish I 'd never seen her . But I also know that if I fail I 'll never be a whole man . I 'll live a gray half-life , and I 'll mourn for my lost girl every hour of the rest of my life . As thoughtful reptiles you will wonder , Why not wait ? Look further ! There are better fish in the sea ! ' But you are not involved . Let me tell you that to me not only are there no better fish , there are no other fish in the sea at all . The sea is lonely without this fish . Put that in your pipe and smoke it ! " He took off his clothes and had a shower and scrubbed himself until his skin was soap-burned and red . He brushed his teeth until his gums bled . His hands were frayed with forrnaline , but he gouged at his discolored nails just the same , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his face was on fire . At last he was ready  --  and still he looked for things to do , to put off his departure . His stomach was crowding up against his chest , forcingp245him to breathe shallowly . I should take a big slug of whisky , he thought . But it would be on my breath and she would know why I 'd taken it . I wonder if she 's frightenedtoo ? You never know . Women can conceal these things better than men . Oh God , what a fool I am ! I ca n't go this way . I 'm falling to pieces . My voice would tremble . Why , the little  --  no , do n't do that . You ca n't build your courage by running her down . You 're going to her , not she to you . Why do I say " you " when it is " I " ? Am I afraid of " I ? " And then he knew what to do . He went to his records and he found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage from his greatness , he thought , I might as well give up . He sat unmoving while Bach built a world and peopled it and organized it and finally fought his world and was destroyed by it . And when the music stopped , as the man had stopped when death came to him , stopped in the middle of a phrase , Doc had his courage back . " Bach fought savagely , " he said . " He was not defeated . If he had lived he would have gone on fighting the impossible fight . " Doc cried to no one , " Give me a little time ! I want to think . What did Bach have that I am hungry for to the point of starvation ? Was n't it gallantry ? And is n't gallantry the great art of the soul ? Is there any more noble quality in the human than gallantry ? " He stopped and then suddenly he seemed to be wracked with inner tears . " Why did n't I know before ? " he asked . " I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw it . Old Bach had his talent and his family and his friends . Everyone has something . And what has Suzy got ? Absolutely nothing in the world but guts . She 's taken on an atomic world with ap246slingshot , and , by God , she 's going to win ! If she does n't win there 's no point in living any more . " What do I mean , win ? " Doc asked himself . " I know . If you are not defeated , you win . " Then he stabbed himself in vengeance for having run Suzy down . " I know what I 'm doing . In the face of my own defeat I 'm warming myself at her gallantry . Let me face this clearly , please ! I need her to save myself . I can be whole only with Suzy . " He stood up and he did not feel silly any more and his mission was not ridiculous . " So long , " he said to the rattlesnakes . " Wish me luck ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of Western Biological . Crossingthe street , he knew he was being observed from every window from which he was visible , and he did n't care . He waved a salute to his unseen audience . Going through the vacant lot among the mallow weeds , he thought , How do you knock on an iron door ? He stooped and picked a rusty tenpenny nail from the ground and he arrived almost gaily at the boiler and tapped a little drumbeat on the iron wall . The firedoor was slightly ajar . Suzy 's voice sounded with a metallic ring . " Who is it ? " " It 's I , " said Doc . " Or me  --  somebody like that . " The firedoor opened and Suzy looked out . " Thanks for the flowers , " she said . " I brought you another present . " She looked at the candy box in his hand . Being on her hands and knees , she had to twist her neck to look up at him . Doc could n't tell whether there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her position . " Candy ? " she asked . " Yes . " " I do n't  --  " she began , and then Fauna 's words crowded in on her with short punches . " What the hell , " she said . " Thanks . " Doc was losing his poise . Suzy had straightened her neck and from her position she could n't see above his knees . Doc tried for lightness again , and he sounded clumsy to himself . " This is a formal call , " he said . " Are n't you going to ask me in ? " " Do you think you can get in ? " " I can try . " " There ai n't much room inside . " Doc remained silent . " Oh , for God 's sakes come on in ! " said Suzy . She backed her head out of the opening . Doc got down on his hands and knees . He threw the candy box through the firedoor , then crawled through the opening . He thought with amusement , A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , and at that moment his trouser cuff caught on the door and pulled it closed against his ankle . He was all inside except one foot and he could not free himself . " I seem to be hung up , " he said . " Hold it , " said Suzy . She straddled him and worked the cuff loose from the door corner . " I think you tore your pants , " she said as she backed off over his shoulders . " Maybe I can mend ' em for you . " Doc 's eyes were getting used to the dim interior . Ap248little light came in from the smokestack and met a little more that entered from the firedoor . " It 's hard to see at first , " said Suzy . " I got a lamp here . Wait , I 'll light it up . " " No need , " said Doc . He could see now and something in him collapsed with pity at the pretension of the curtains , the painted walls , and the home-built dressing table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brave thing is the human ! he thought . And then Suzy brought his rising compassioncrashing down . " There 's a welder eats at the Poppy . Know what he 's going to do first any day he can ? Bring his torch and cut windows in the sides . " Her voice echoed with enthusiasm . " I 'll put in little window frames and some flower boxes with red geraniums , " she said . " ' Course , I 'll have to paint the outside then , white , I think , with green trim . Maybe a trellis like in front . I got a nice hand with roses . " Then she was silent . Constraint and formality sifted in and filled the boiler . Doc thought in wonder , It 's not a boiler at all . Somehowshe has managed to make a home of this . He said , " You 've done a wonderful job here . " " Thanks . " He spoke his thought . " It 's a real home . " " It 's comfortable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . " " Well , you have now . " " Sometimes I set in here and think how they 'd have to blast to get me out if I did n't want to come . "  |p249Doc  gathered his courage . " Suzy , I 'm sorry for what hap-pened . " " I do n't want to talk about it . It was n't none of your fault . " " Yes , it was . " " I do n't think so , " she said with finality . " I would do anything to  --  " " Look , Doc , " she said , " you wo n't let it alone , so maybe 1 got to rub your nose in it a little . It was n't no fault of yours , but it sure as hell give me a lesson . I had myself a bawl and now it 's done . There ai n't nothing for you to do . I do n't need nothing . Anybody 's sorry for me , they 're wasting their time . I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Well , do n't forget it ! There ai n't nothing for you nor nobody to do ' cause I 'm doing it all myself . If you can get that through your knocker , okay . If you ca n't , you better take a powder . " He said , " What a conceited fool I 've been ! " Then silence hung in the boiler . Suzy broke it when she felt that his nose was sufficiently rubbed in it . " Know what ? " she said brightly . " They got a night class , typing , at the high school . I signed up . Next Satur day I get a rent typewriter . I can learn . " " I 'll bet you can too . Maybe you 'll type my paper for me . " " You 're going to write it after all ? " " I 've got to , Suzy . It 's all I have . I 'm a dead duck withoutit . I 'm going to La Jolla Saturday for the spring tides . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " I do n't like to see nobodyp250kicked in the face . " She drew up formality like a coverlet . " You want I should make you a nice cup of tea ? I got a Sterno stove . " " I 'd like it . " She had the situation in hand now , and she talked on easily while she lighted the stove and put her little teakettleon to boil . " I 'm making good tips down at the Poppy , " she said . " Paid off Joe Blaikey in two weeks . Ella 's thinking about taking a week 's vacation . She ai n't never had a vacation . Hell , I can run the joint easy . ' Scuse that hell . ' I do n't hardly never cuss no more . " " You 're doing fine , " said Doc . " Could you tell me , withoutrubbing my nose in it , what you want in a man ? Might help me  --  another time . " " Tea 's ready , " said Suzy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep a little longer , " she said . " Sugar 's in the cup on the dressing table . " When he was stirring the sugar in she said , " If I thought it was n't a pitch you was making I 'd tell you . " " I do n't think it 's a pitch . " " Okay then . Maybe what I want ai n't anywhere in the world , but I want it , so I think there is such a thing . I want a guy that 's wide open . I want him to be a real guy , maybe even a tough guy , but I want a window in him . He can have his dukes up every other place but not with me . And he got to need the hell out of me . He got to be the kind of guy that if he ai n't got me he ai n't got nothing . And brother , that guy 's going to have something ! " " Except for toughness , you 're kind of describing me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
