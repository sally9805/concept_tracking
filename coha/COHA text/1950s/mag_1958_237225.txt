While the stock market scrambled to a new 1958 high for the third week in a row , the bond market was still in trouble . Part of it was due to continued speculative selling by free-riders in Government bonds ( TIME , June 30 ) . But a bigger cause was the fact that the corporate bond market was swamped with high-grade issues , was trying to peddle them at a time when investors were increasingly queasy over the Federal Reserve 's next move on interest rates . <P> Wall Street glumly estimated a float of $100 million to $150 million worth of unsold high-grade bonds in dealers ' hands , with another $500 million worth of new bonds scheduled for offering within the next three weeks . The market was so saturated that Standard Oil of California decided to withdraw a planned $150 million offering because the underwriters ' suggested price was too high . A $20 million issue by Pacific Power &; Light Co. was tough to sell even with a yield of 4.35% . Moreover , when two syndicates that had been supporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . withdrew their support , the bonds immediately dropped a point or two , and still had trouble finding buyers . Halsey , Stuart &; Co. , with a $50 million Consolidated Edison issue , was also in trouble , but it extended its underwriting pact in hopes of getting out of its commitment at a better price in the next few weeks . <P> Everyone was waiting for some indication of the Federal Reserve 's future money policy . Last week the direction was still toward easy money . The Federal Reserve 's open market committee continued its buying of Government bonds , thus helping stabilize the market . Moreover , it announced that for the week ending June 25 , average free reserves of member banks hit $611 million and the highest level in 3 years . To Wall Street it meant that there would still be plenty of money around for investment once the market settled down .
