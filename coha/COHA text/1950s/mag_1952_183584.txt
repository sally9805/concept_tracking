Sculptor Reuben Nakian is a short , bristling rock of a man with a pronounced stutter and an utter inability to feel anything mildly . As a rising artist back in the ' 30s , he nursed a great passion for contemporary heroes . He did powerful portrait busts of some of the men around F.D.R.-Henry Wallace , Rex Tugwell , General Hugh Johnson-and modeled Babe Ruth into an eight-foot giant with the air of an arrogant Hercules . Critics admired his work , but then something happened and Nakian all but disappeared . <P> The trouble was that Nakian felt he was crowding the " hairline between greatness and corniness . " His work seemed too glib , too academic-and commercial . Nakian settled back to study his favorite masters-Titian , Rubens , Van Gogh , Cezanne-and read avidly through the Greek classics . The classics , he felt , had everything a sculptor could want , especially the story of how Jupiter disguised himself as a bull and carried the fair Europa off to Crete . Nakian spent five years pummeling and twisting the clay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a tremendous , wild figure , more bizarre than Picasso or Henry Moore , " but it lacked " greatness . " Nakian destroyed it with blows of his sledge . <P> Last week , now 54 and getting grey , Reuben Nakian was in a Manhattan gallery with an exhibit he was certain was worth saving . Working at Newark 's School of Fine and Industrial Art , the center of a group of noisy , eager students , he has turned out 15 large and small statues in two years . All are of Europa and the bull done in natural clay washed over with red , black and pastel glazes . The work looks rough and half-finished , is built of abstract masses of streaming , fluted clay with little or no regard for anatomy . The angry figures of Europa and Jupiter are frequently lost in swirls and whorls , the dolphins and nymphs cavorting at their feet are jagged points and blobs . But the statues have much of the grace and power Nakian has worked to achieve . <P> Nakian calls his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voyage , he says , that he has been on ever since he first started daubing in clay 40 years ago .
