The hills around Besenhausen on the border between East and West Germany were veiled in sunlit haze one afternoon last week . On the Soviet side of the crossing point , a tired horde of D.P.s moved forward as the barrier pole swung up . On the British side , British officers and customs controllers , German border guards , police , priests , nuns , nurses and refugee administration officials looked at the sad group facing them . <P> From the British loudspeaker a voice began : " Achtung ! Bitte Melden ! Elizabeth Schmidt , mit zwei Kindern " Frau <P> Schmidt stumbled through the crowd with her two small sons by the hand . The boys carried a brown enamel soup can and tattered cloth shopping bags . The loudspeaker squawked again : " Paul Fehr . F-e-h-r . " No one moved . A man 's trembling voice spoke from the rear : " 1st . . . nicht . . . mitgekommen did n't come along . " As more names were read off , nearly half were " nicht mitgekommen " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every day , hundreds of refugees slip into West Germany illegally from the East , and officials take no notice of them . But the scene at Besenhausen was part of a bungled attempt to admit D.P.s to the West in an orderly way . " Operation Link " was what the British called their part of an Allied agreement to take from Poland 25,000 Germans who had relatives in West Germany . The names of those D.P.s approved by the Western powers had been duly listed , but thousands of others , not on the lists , had got exit permits or entry papers ( Zuzugsgenehmigungen ) from Polish or Allied agencies . <P> Need . At Besenhausen , German officials had received a list of 200 refugees ready for transfer from a Soviet zone camp at Heiligenstadt . Only 101 of the 200 were on the " Link " lists . Allied officials asked the East German authorities to send the 101 to the crossing point . But the Communists , for reasons of their own , sent nearly 300 . Said a British official : " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I can do . I 'll send for another list to try to take care of the others . " <P> Those who got across the border threw their arms around the welcoming nurses , or cried with relief ; two women fell to their knees to kiss the soil of freedom . A little boy hugged his teddybear : " Teddy 's come all the way from Liegnitz . He and I are going to live with uncle . " One little girl , given an orange , had never seen one before , thought it was a yellow potato . The refugees left behind watched silently , too exhausted for envy , too worried for vicarious happiness . When the reading of the British list was ended , only 55 refugees had crossed the border . <P> This was the moment the Communists had been waiting for . They had organized a special tour for the press , and reporters rushed forward to get case histories of the people left behind . The Red loudspeakers went into action , blaring that the heartless Western powers were breaking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Communists produced some special cases they had been saving : a paralyzed woman who had been hidden in a press radio truck , a blind woman , a father who had searched all over <P> Poland for his six children , had found three and brought them to the border , only to find that they were not on the list .
