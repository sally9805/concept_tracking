MR . SMITH ( 278 pp. ) - Louis Bromfield - Harper ( $3 ) . <P> <P> One morning while shaving , Wolcott Ferris , prosperous insurance broker , froze before his bathroom mirror as if he had seen a shrunken head . He had seen something worse : his shrunken self . " What are you missing ? " he asked his blue-grey eyes . " Why the hell do you exist ? Why do you go on living ? " Why had life been picked clean to the bones short of 40 ? <P> All the answers Ferris can dredge up are corroded with hate and futility . He loathes his job , is desperately weary of the daily stint on the office treadmill . He detests his pretentious " neo-Georgian " home in Oakdale , a genteel Midwestern suburb . Most of all he hates " the goddamn blood-drinking octopus " he married . Enid Ferris is one of those primly efficient young matrons who know how to place-kick an indulgent husband over the goal posts of a cash culture to make a social score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeamish about the claims of the flesh , she chills Ferris ' love-making with protests like : " Do n't ! Where did you learn such a filthy trick ? " After two children , they take to twin beds and an expurgated marital life . <P> Values F.O.B. Ferris tries to fill the loveless void with cocktails , out-of-town stag sprees , and finally an affair with a rich divorcee , Mary Raeburn . While the whole town is clucking , Ferris discovers that Mary , in her own way , is as much of an emotional bankrupt as Enid . One afternoon he finds her doubled in pain from the need for dope ; she is a hopeless addict . <P> Their affair ends just as World War II begins . For Ferris , it means a late reprieve from the " little-death " trap he is in . <P> He enlists , only to be marooned on a tiny South Pacific island supply depot . There he types reams in a confessional diary , relating his failure as a human being to that of all the other middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead lives of quiet desperation . " He decides he has never been his own man . His values have come f.o.b . Detroit , New York , Hollywood . Instead of the surges of the heart , he has lived by the slogans of the hucksters . One night a confused sentry mistakes him for a Jap , sends him to meet the man-sized death he secretly yearns for . <P> Change from Jello . As a slash at American middle-class life , Mr. Smith rarely cuts more than cuticle-deep . But for Author Louis Bromfield , who has tackled only Jello-weight themes for years , it marks an abrupt change of mental pace . Dunked in soggy prose and soupy characters , Mr. Smith still claims a kissing kinship with Babbitt and Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman . <P> It also contains many of the standard gibes of European intellectuals-no surprise , since Midwesterner Bromfield himself spent 15 expatriate years in France prior to 1938 . The ideas behind Mr. Smith hatched after his return . " I was struck very forcefully , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been living here all that time . " Chief among them : " The confusion in the minds of many Americans about the importance of water closets , automobiles , radios , etc . They think they are civilized because they have these . But they actually are a means to an end , not an end itself . "
