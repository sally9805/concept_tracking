single steel complex - the five-plant United Steel Cos . Ltd. , which last year produced 13% ( 2,172,000tons ) of all British steel - went on sale to the public last week . It was the first nationalized steel company to be offered for public sale , * thus represented the biggest step yet taken by the Conservatives to turn the industry back , as promised , to private ownership . <P> Former owners of United Steel got first crack at the shares , and even though the company has been modernized and expanded nearly 100% while in government hands , they can exchange , on a value-for-value basis , the government shares given them when the company was nationalized . The company , capitalized at 16 million when nationalized , is capitalized at 30 million ( $84 million ) in the stock sale . About one-third of its ownership is represented by this issue , 10,194 , - ooo shares priced at 25 shillings ( $3.50 ) . <P> As Britain 's largest and most efficient steel complex , United was an attractive investment . But the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 7% on the shares , about 1% more than the going rate on comparable securities . Moreover , to compensate for fears that owners might simply lose their property all over again should the Labor Party get reelected , the government provided that " gilt edges " ( government bonds ) may be traded for the steel shares at a ratio greater than their market value . <P> Nine of London 's top-drawer underwriting houses guaranteed to buy any unsold stock , but they hope the public will buy it all . They feel that the more widely the ownership is held , the less likely that Britain 's Socialists will try to nationalize the industry again . <P> <P> - Two other companies have been sold privately ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) .
