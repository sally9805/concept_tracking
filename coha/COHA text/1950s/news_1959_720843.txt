txt WELLINGTON , New Zealand . During the autumn of 1956 New Zealand developed an acute case of schizophrenia when the Suez crisis temporarily pushed Britain and the United States into opposing policy corners , for this country is the most bullish of John Bulls , more English than the English , but it depends for its security upon an American alliance . As a consequence the national personality split asunder . Emotional impulses brought a wave of strong support for London to which were added overtones of indignation at our attitude . But world strategic realities emphasized an embarrassed intellectual realization of just how heavily Wellington leans on Washington . Fortunately the Suez rift healed swiftly . And Macmillan , when he was here last year , went out of his way to reassure New ' Zealanders that he approved of their connection with the United States . He said : " There are some who feel that the pact which New Zealand and Australia made with the United States has somehow weakened your links with us . But to my mind these arguments have no force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new friends there is no loosening of family ties . * * * Upon the close cooperation and alliance of the Commonwealth and the United States almost everything today depends . " Macmillan 's sensible words put an end to a period of worried confusion . For , regardless of New Zealanders ' military dependence on an American shield , their hearts have never left England . This land is so pro-British that an Englishman should feel embarrassed . People who have never seen the United Kingdom still refer to it as " home . " The radio news is merely a tape recording of that morning 's B. B. C. New Zealand , as a matter of fact , achieved dominion status and even ? tual independence almost against its will . This status became an achingly lonely one when Japan began it ; Pacific offensive in 1941 . New Zea- , land 's small army was helping Britain in the Middle East and London could spare no major forces for the Orient . When an American ' cruiser arrived ; n Wellington eaviy in 1942 people were seriously discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie With U. S. Since then the new American relationship has developed . Thousands of our troops passed through here during the war , In 1951 New Zealand happily signed the ANZUS Pact with Australia and ourselves . While , in a sentimental sense , the British bond remains the strongest external factor in New Zealand 's life , in a hard - headed sense the American alliance is supreme . Both major political parties display sympathetic understanding for our foreign policy . When the present Labor Government came to office it was demanding recognition of Red China , accommodation with Russia and an end to nuclear tests . But when it assumed administrative responsibility Labor quietly dropped these attitudes . Prime Minister Nash even became a strong admirer of Dulles . Like its predecessors , the present Cabinet advocates collective security , but it backstops dreams with practical alliances . There are three such commitments . The first is ANZAM ( which ? whi is only a technical agreement with Britain and Australia regarding the stationing of troops on the Malay Peninsula . The second is SEATO , by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the real alliance as far as New Zealanders are concerned . Despite its tiny population of less than three million , it should in no way be thought that this nation does not pull its weight in ANZUS . Indeed , the geographical position of New Zealand is of particular value to the United States . We base our entire , extensive and costly exploratory effort in Antarctica upon airfields and seaports located on this country 's southern island . From the above summary it may be seen how utterly essential to New Zealand 's spiritual composure and material well being , indeed to its national existence , are friendship and collaboration between the United I States and Britain . Were this land , followed forced to Hobson 's choice , if it followed the dictates of reason and chose Washington it might die of a broken heart . But if it followed the dictates of emotion and chose London , it might die of a broken spine . That is just another proof of the need for Anglo-American cooperation on a global scale .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
