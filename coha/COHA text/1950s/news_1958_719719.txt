txt Furcolo administration forces are counting on municipal official pressures over the weekend to help turn defeat into victory in the withholding tax controversy . After two days of hot debate over the Furcolo proposal , the Senate has delayed until Monday the final decision on the controversial plan . But up to now the administration has met Senate defeat at every turn on the legislation by which it hopes to pick up 17 million dollars to help balance his 418-milliondollar budget . At his press conference today Governor Furcolo asserted that the withholding tax would provide a S2 to $15 tax rate reduction for various communities . " It seems to me the people of communities who want their tax rates reduced ought to find cut how their senators have voted on withholding . I particularly address my remarks to people in communities whose senators voted against the measure , " he said . Beacon Hill Views Senator John E. Powers ( D ) of Boston , Senate minority leader and chief ball carrier in the upper branch for the measure , makes no secret of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side . He is working hard toward that end . The South Boston senator , who already has contacted several mayors on the issue , said " It is up to them . They have a big stake in this thing . If they come through , we can win . " At the same time he said that if the bill is defeated he will ask Governor Furcolo to send in a special message reviving it . Such action would keep the withholding tax before the Legislature while it battles over the budget and its financing . The municipal enticement in the withholding tax system is a 37-million-dollar revenue pickup in the 1959 calendar year for the cities and towns , if the plan goes through . Such a revenue windfall would constitute a financial boon to hard-pressed local officials facing continually mounting ' tax rates . The drawback , however , is that it would be a one-year windfall which could create additional problems by spurring municipal spending . Conte Motion Rejected As of the moment , barring possible shifts resulting from municipal pressures and other factors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again takes up the issue . Senate defeat of a motion by Senator Silvio 0 . Conte ( R ) of Pittsfield , to grant taxpayers a 29 per cent tax forgiveness of 1938 income to wipe out overlapping tax payments has swelled the opposition ranks to 21 of the 40 Senate votes . Be- ' fore his motion was rejected by a 20 to 19 vote the Pittsfield senator announced he would vote against the withholding tax plan , unless a tax forgiveness amendment were adopted . While the Governor at his press conference refused to say whether or not he would sign a withholding tax bill with a " forgiveness clause " in it , he said , " My opinion is that cities and towns would get little or no assistance with forgiveness . " In response to a question he said a tax forgiveness plan " is possible but difficult of administration . " The Furcolo administration and Senator Powers must pick up two extra votes between now and Monday if they are to win . Although most observers now expect defeat of the legislation , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing side-swapping operations which have featured the bill 's course thus far . The 37-million-dollar extra revenue for municipalities under the plan may well prove very tempting to some municipal officials . For instance , Senator Powers pointed out that Boston would get $7,673,430 extra in calendar 1959 out of that 37-million-dollar revenue pie . That amounts to about 5 dollars on the Boston tax rate . Marston Backs Bill Worcester 's share would be $1,714,950 , under the figures supplied to Senator Powers by the State Department of Corporations and Taxation . Springfield would realize $1 , - 528,470 , Cambridge $1,006,030 , Newton $971,250 , and other communities corresponding amounts . While the smaller communities , including the towns , would get much smaller amounts , they would bulk as large in their revenue pictures as the bigger amounts would in the larger cities . As the line-up now stands , all Republican senators except one ( Charles S. Marston 3d of Haverhill ) are recorded in opposition to the bill as it now stands , along with one Democrat , Senator James W. Hennigan , Jr. , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all April 24 motions to delay action on the measure but he voted with the proponents on a key vote on Wednesday . Furthermore , with adoption by the Senate of a Marston proposal to amend the measure to grant employers a one-half of per cent to 3 per cent share of taxes withheld to help meet extra bookkeeping costs , it is expected the Haverhill senator will remain with the proponents on the final vote . Financial Gap Noted It is known that the administration has been exerting considerable pressure on Senator Edward J. DeSaulnier ( R ) of Chelmsford . to swing him behind the bill . While the Chelmsford senator supported motions to delay action , even to the point of tabling the measure , until the state 's financial picture is firmly determined , he made it clear in debate that if the measure is brought to a final vote now , he will vote against it . Defeat of the measure would . force the administration to take drastic steps to close the financial gap in the budget now before the House Committee on Ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overlapping payments under the withholding tax , the administration 's budget will be heavily out of balance . Even with the windfall , it will be out of balance unless the Furcolo - proposed cigarette tax hike proposal and his recommendation for a 9-million-dollar bond refinancing are adopted , or drastic economies are instituted .
