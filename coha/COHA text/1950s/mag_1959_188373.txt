In sticky midsummer heat at Washington 's Boiling Air Force Base last week , 3,000 Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine Corps servicemen , high civilian brass and Congressmen turned out for a unique demonstration of interservice unity . They were there to salute two four-star Air Force generals who , in distinguished careers in World War II and the cold war , had come to symbolize that interservice unity . The generals : Otto P. Weyland , 57 , boss of Tactical Air Command , and Earle Everard Partridge , 59 , head of North American Air Defense Command-both at the point of retirement . <P> Blond , long-legged ( 6 ft. , 185 Ibs . ) " Opie " Weyland , California-born Texas A. &; M. graduate , made his first general 's fame as head of the XIX Tactical Air Command , which supported General George S. Patton Jr . ' s Third Army on its advance through France and Germany . High point : Weyland 's planes protected Patton 's southern flank during the first streak to the Seine ( " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , strafed 20,000 German troops so mightily that they surrendered to U.S. airpower . <P> Weyland commanded the hands-tied Far Eastern U.S. and U.N . air forces in Korea , then , as head of the Air Force 's Tactical Air Command , pioneered the high-mobility , nuclear-tipped , composite air-strike forces that got their showdown test when they were flown to support U.S. diplomacy in Lebanon and Quemoy ( TIME , July 28 , 1958 et seq . ) . Said he : " TAC never has had priority , like SAC . TAG had to make do with what it could get , and by God , we have . " <P> Slim ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 165 Ibs . ) " Pat " Partridge graduated from West Point in 1924 , rose through World War II bomber service in Europe with Generals Jimmy Doolittle and Curtis LeMay and postwar duty in the Pentagon to command the Fifth Air Force under Weyland in Korea . There Partridge won the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry in action in an unusual spot for an air commander . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N . forces advancing against Pyongyang and Chinnampo , completed his mission even though his plane was hit repeatedly by enemy ground machine-gun fire . <P> Partridge succeeded Weyland as Far East Air Force commander in chief in 1954 . Three years later , as head of the U.S.-Canadian interservice North American Air Defense Command , he tried to clean up the classic NORAD interservice rivalry , succeeded in getting the Joint Chiefs to back up the NORAD commander with some ( but , by Partridge 's lights , not enough ) additional powers . <P> On hand for the interservice farewell to Generals Weyland and Partridge at Boiling : Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Nathan Twining , Air Force Chief of Staff General Thomas D. White , Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James S. Russell , Army Chief of Staff General Lyman Lemnitzer.
