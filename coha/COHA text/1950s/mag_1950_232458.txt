Washington 's lean , lanky Senator Harry P. Cain has been called " the No. 1 real-estate lobbyist in America , " and says he considers it a compliment . Last week Cain proved his claim to the title . <P> Up for debate was a bill to extend federal rent control ( due to expire June 30 ) for six more months , with a second six-month extension for those cities that wanted it . Administration leaders were pushing the bill hard for good political reasons-29 million people still living under rent controls were concentrated in such crucial states as Illinois , California and Pennsylvania . Harry Cain promptly announced a one-man filibuster , promised to speak " as long as I can stand up . " <P> Pickles &; Coffee . When the Senate convened on Friday , Cain was ready . Dressed in a tan gabardine suit , fitted out with a rubber urinal strapped to his left leg under his trousers , he took his stand at the front-row desk of Republican Floor Leader Kenneth Wherry . " My fight is for fair play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cain rasped on , reading telegrams from sympathizers , commenting on golf scores , on tents , on veterans . He argued that any community that wanted control could impose it ( as New York State had with Tom Dewey 's backstop legislation ) , that " small , thrifty , Godfearing property owners " were being discriminated against because all other price controls had been lifted . Hitching at his belt , nibbling potato chips and a pickle , sipping milk and coffee , Cain proclaimed that even in 1947 there was no real shortage of housing ; the trouble was that people were just not distributed properly . <P> Discreetly , Republicans and Southern Democrats gave him breathers by posing long questions . Three times Wherry wangled short recesses on the pretext that he could get an agreement from Cain . Each time , Cain made a beeline for the washroom , returning to his desk relieved and refreshed . But he flatly refused to compromise . By suppertime , each side had reduced itself to a corporal 's guard , left behind in case of a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cots in the cloakrooms . Some fortified their spirits with quick nips of bourbon . <P> Until Christmas ? Just after midnight , Cain abruptly ended his speech and demanded a quorum call . His filibuster had lasted 12 hours and 8 minutes. * The sergeant-at-arms began routing out snoozing Senators and , when he could not find enough , was ordered to arrest a few-a temper-raising procedure which had not been invoked since 1942 . But arrests proved unnecessary as , one by one , Senators straggled in , grinning sheepishly as their waiting colleagues applauded each latecomer . For an hour the Senators wrangled . Lucas wanted an agreement to vote on the bill itself ; Wherry demanded a vote on a motion to send it back to committee . Wherry won , and wearily , at 3:48 a.m. , the Senators went home . <P> This week Cain announced spryly that he was ready to resume his filibuster at a moment 's notice , but the Senate resoundingly ( 44-25 ) defeated Wherry 's motion to recommit the bill . Harry Cain gave up . <P> Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill through and sent it to the House . <P> Last week the Senate also :
