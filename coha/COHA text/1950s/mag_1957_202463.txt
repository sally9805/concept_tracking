PAINTING is an illusionistic art , a substitute for reality , and should be seen indoors , " says Britain 's famed Sculptor Henry Moore . " Sculpture can be at home out of doors because it is real , real as a tree . " <P> Suiting action to words , Henry Moore works in the open and keeps his works out of doors . At 59 , Moore is the first native-born British sculptor ever to achieve so exalted an international reputation. * To his white-walled , red-roofed house on the outskirts of Much Hadham in Hertfordshire , about 30 miles north of London , come visitors of all nations on pilgrimage . They are led down a garden path past herbaceous borders and neat rows of vegetables to emerge suddenly in an open field . Against this lush background stand some weather-beaten perennials ( opposite ) , Moore 's abstractions , scooped-out females , spatulate King and Queen , draped Reclining Figure. * <P> Moore keeps his figures in the field because he believes that " daylight , sunlight is necessary to sculpture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He fully realizes that some open-air sites are wrong for some sculptures , e.g. , a windswept hilltop for a realistic statue of a naked adolescent girl . But he likes to place his work " with room to stretch the eye beyond , " seeing it in relation to sky and trees , on murky days , in summer sunshine and snow , surrounded by space , air and light . " Indoors , " he says , " one can put a piece of sculpture under a flattering light and kid oneself that what only half exists is already there , but a sculpture almost fails to exist under the diffused light of the open if it is n't fully conceived in the round . " <P> Hard by Moore 's field is Moore 's simple whitewashed studio where he works on an open veranda under a transparent roof that keeps him from being rained out . Last week he was chipping away at a huge chunk of dazzling white plaster against the deep green grass and bright blue sky . It was the working model for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in front of the UNESCO building in Paris . It will be completed next year . <P> With increasing commissions from commercial and industrial firms and public institutions to do sculpture for a variety of business and public buildings , Moore , along with other sculptors , has got an increasing amount of work , filling his schedule for years ahead . That , too , is sculpture in the open , with figures fronting buildings , fitting into architectural spaces , giving relief to severe simplicity , rigorous lines , unrelenting material . Though the rewards of this work are enormous , Moore 's first love is still nature . Says he : " I would rather have a piece of my sculpture put in a landscape , almost any landscape , than in or on the most beautiful building I know .
