D. H. COLE , the most versatile of Laborite Englishmen , seems to be try- ? ing to stir up a contemporary interest in that most versatile of Victorians , Samuel Butler , about whom he wrote a critical study a few years back . Now , in The Essential Samuel Butler ( Dutton , $3.75 ) , he has put together five-hundred-odd pages of Butler 's writings , reproducing also two oil paintings and the score of one piece of his music . Nothing could be more laudable than an attempt to get an audience for Butler , but I fear that Cole , who of course edited with a British audience in mind , is not in the present instance doing what should really be done for the cause on this side of the ocean . The Essential Samuel Butler lives up to its title admirably , which explains what is wrong with it . Most of the space is taken up with slightly cut versions of The Way of All Flesh and Erewhon , both of which are available here in uncut Modern Library editions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unessential but not unwonderful works : The Note-Books , which are skimpily represented in this volume ; the superbly wrong-headed works on evolution , which Cole has passed over , perhaps rightly in view of his design and the limitations on it , in favor of the magazine series called " The Deadlock in Darwinism , " which seems dull to inc and less amusingly argumentative than most of his writings ; Alps and Sanctuaries , of which no part appears in the Cole collection ; and the literary criticism , which is oddly spoken for by a few snatches from Butler 's translation of Homer . Cole 's greatest service is in reprint-ing the " Memoir of John Pickard Owen , " . a fiction which originally stood as the introduction to The Fair Haven , Butler 's ironic treatise on nineteenth-century Christian theology . Still , anything that wins a few new readers to Butler is all to the good . The neglect of him today is a sad and perplexing business . Many people , to be sure , read The Way of All Flesh , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that alone is to get to know not an author but a book ? and a book which , as it happens , can be greatly enriched for us by a knowledge of its author . But although Butler has been more fortunate than most writers in his biographers and his disciples , he has never had , except in the brief period that followed the posthumous publication of The Way of All Flesh in 1903 , the kind of audience he deserves . Even in that period , though , Bernard Shaw had to say , in the preface to Major Barbara in 1907 , how unfortunate it was that he could write " plays in which Butler 's extraordinarily fresh , free , and future-piercing suggestions have an obvious share " and be " met with nothing but vague cacklings about Ibsen and Nietzsche . " We now hear less of Ibsen and Nietzsche than Shaw did ( less , too , than we ought to hear ) and practically nothing about Butler . I imagine that it is Butler 's very versatility that denies him an audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is substantially the same , a person uncowed by specialists ? to appreciate this gallant , gifted amateur . Thus , the tragedy of our neglect is fenced about by a vicious circle , for it is Butler 's amateurism that we need as much as anything else he can give us . The great thing about Butler is that he came to grips with his whole spiritual and intellectual environment . He was never apologetic for not being a specialist ; indeed , he said it was the specialist who ought to apologize for not being an amateur ? or , in his word , a generalist . At the same time , there was nothing flighty or irresponsible about him . " There is no excuse for amateur work being bad , " he wrote . When lie took on the Darwinians and the Protestant theologians , he was equipped with the learning he needed in the battles he planned to fight . In fact , one should perhaps say that it was the combination of amateurism and responsibility for which we should really honor him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but neither was he contemptuous of them , except when they invited contempt . He attacked many of their ideas , but he was able , as so many present-day writers are not , to do this without ever belittling science itself or scientific method . He was able to score off scientists because he was himself a profoundly scientific spirit . Similarly , he could score off theologians because his view of life matched , and in most cases exceeded , theirs in dignity and seriousness . Addressing himself to his own role in life , Butler once said , " The question is , what is the amateur an amateur of ? What is he really in love with ? Is he in love with other people , thinking he sees something which he would like to show them ? If this is his position , he can do no wrong , the spirit in which he works will insure that his defects will be only as bad spelling or bad grammar in some pretty saying of a child . " He was thinking most of all of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other field in which he worked . There is , then , an attitude toward life and toward the mind to be learned from Butler . One might sum it all up as a mighty self-respect . " Oh , if men would but leave off lying to themselves , " he once had a sympathetic character say . " If they would but learn the sacredness of their own likes and dislikes . " The exercise of individual moral and intellectual discrimination seemed to him the most important thing a man could do . Self-respect is thus the foundation of his art and his philosophy , but almost everything he built onthat foundation is still stimulating on its own account . To a degree , he anticipated modern psychology . To a larger degree , he anticipated modern sociology . He had as deep an understanding of the role of institutions as anyone in his time or ours . No one can say how many men of letters he anticipated . Though he produced little fiction , he displayed in what he wrote an astonishing versatility . Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pickard Owen , " he was able to range from a knowledge of boyhood as deep as Mark Twain 's to a manipulation of ideas as subtle as , say , Santayana 's . It is sometimes said that many of his insights into life are valueless to us now because they have become common property . The battles he fought , it is held , have already been won . I do not think this is so . The particular tyrannies he described in , for example , The Way of All Flesh may no longer have quite the power they once had to cripple lives , but anyone who reads that book simply as a document of Victorian society misses its true grandeur . It is the expression of a determinedly free spirit that can be a living ally today because it once confronted life whole . " I made no alliances , " Butler said proudly . He meant that his only pact was with truth and that he had entered into this strictly as his own man . S EVERAL recent books should prove rewarding to laymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , diversion and instruction in legal history and legal ideas . Rene A. Wormser 's The Law ( Simon &; Schuster , $5 ) is one of those chatty , charty , agreeable outlines of history , Hammurabi-toFrankfurter in this case , that flourish everywhere nowadays and that , when they are well done , leave one in doubt as to whether to praise or damn them for their competence . The question is not so much whether they satisfy a legitimate thirst as whether they are likely in many cases to quench the thirst permanently . No such troublesome questions are raised by the late Morris R. Cohen 's Reason and Law ( Free Press , $3.50 ) , by Jerome N. Frank 's Courts on Trial ( Princeton University Press , $5 ) , or by Edward N. Cahn 's The Sense of Injustice ( New York University Press . $3.50 ) . All of these are modest in conception and solid in design . On the one hand , there is nothing parochial about them , and NEW on the other , they refuse to address themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaudy shingle ( " Homer : The First Law Reporter , " " Solon 's New Deal , " " William Begins a New System " ) . Morris Cohen , of course , was a layman himself , a philosopher who stood in relation to the law as a great critic stands in relation to literature . In Reason and Law , his publishers have assembled what they say are the last of his legal papers to be published in book form . These are mostly reviews and fugitive essays , but Cohen was a man who took every job with high seriousness , and nothing he wrote failed to reveal the toughness of his mind or the gentleness of his spirit . Judge Frank 's book goes a good deal further than its journalistic title would suggest and is , in fact , a restatement of his whole legal credo , which was first set forth twenty years ago in Law and the Modern Mind and which is held by qualified authorities to have had more influence on legal thought and practice in this country than any since Hohnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's essay is likely to prove a stiff dose for the layman ? though hardly stiffer for him than for his attorney ? but it goes to the heart of matters that involve us all and is as richly suggestive as anything I have lately come across in any field . O F ALL these estimable jurists , Judge Frank is the one who is likely to charm the layman most . He is a man who should be a lot better known in this country than he is , for he happens to be one of the few truly protean figures of our age , a man whose breadth of interest and intellectual gusto would surely have commended him to Samuel Butler . Those of us who have been privileged to know him are firm in the conviction that as a conversationalist he could meet his match only in Dr. Johnson and that he could easily have drawn away Oscar Wilde 's most enraptured auditors and left Wilde mumbling to himself in a corner . Although the better part of his work has been in the law , his erudition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychology , architecture , and government , and he has written with as much knowledge as BOOKS zest in all of these fields . He exists , as his friend and colleague , Judge Learned Hand , once said , in a state of " perpetual cerebration , " During the thirties , he cerebrated in half a dozen agencies of the New Deal , ending his career as chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission , from which he was appointed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals . Courts on Trial is informed from start to finish by Judge Frank 's enormous learning and charged with his palpable delight in life and controversy . Since it is a restatement and elaboration of his whole legal philosophy , its starting point is an attack on the concept of legal certainty , which is the child of Natural Law . Although Natural Law has come back into favor in some quarters as part of the stylish revival of authoritarian religion , it is unlikely that the headiest of revivalists would attach to it the meaning it had three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its influence on the search for justice in human affairs is still great even among those who would disown a belief in it . Indeed , he feels so strongly about the confusion of Natural Law with the codes by which men try to bring order and decency into their relations with other men that he will not , except when forced to it by convention , allow the word " law " to cross his lips or issue from his pen . Instead , all through this book , he speaks of laws as " rules . " But he grants no independent power or substance to the " rules " except as the referees have applied them to specific plays . Believing with Holmes that what we call the law is merely " what the courts do in fact , " he further reduces the active force of the law to " decisions " and wraps up the entire judicial process in a quasi-algebraic equation , which reads " R x F = D " and which means that the applicable rules ( R ) multiplied by the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court 's decision ( D ) . The legal equation is a human equation . The rules are man-made , the facts are man-determined , and the decision can never be anything but a compound of human wisdom and unwisdom . To recognize this and to act freely on our recognition is not , he thinks , to lower our sights but to
