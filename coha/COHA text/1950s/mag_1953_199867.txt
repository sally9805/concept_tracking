Picnic ( by William Inge ) has to do with haves and have-nots-but in amatory rather than economic terms , and not always to the haves ' advantage . Laid in a small Kansas town , the play tells of a number of women and young girls , of their longings for men and marriage , and of the havoc created among them by a bull-like youth who happens by . <P> A good-looking , good-for-nothing roughneck ( Ralph Meeker ) , he comes among a widow who had married unwisely for love ; her two daughters , one beautiful and besought ( Janice Rule ) , the other bright and coltishly adolescent ( Kim Stanley ) ; her boarder , an old-maid schoolteacher with an unmatrimonial-minded beau ; her next-door neighbor , a middle-aged woman chained to an invalid mother . The roughneck and the beautiful girl fall hard for each other : there is a climactic scene where they dance slowly and sexually , while the other women look on-awed , envious , aroused . The fellow is sent about his business in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of naturalistic round-dance of women hungry for what they have lost or never had or were better off without . Fulfillment is as precarious as frustration : the young girl , in throwing in her lot with the roughneck , is very likely throwing away her life ; the teacher and the storekeeper she desperately snares in her cups invoke wedding bells that are more mocking than merry . <P> As in Come Back , Little Sheba , Playwright Inge treats of what is blundering in life , and dryly enough for the play 's pity to reside in its pitilessness . Picnic has its very human scenes and characters , its anonymous , quick intensities , and it keeps faith with its material . But about much of it there seems something straggling and merely approximate : it lacks form , it needs more expressive detail , more evocative language . And it is coarsened by Joshua Logan 's direction , which often pedal-thumps the sex and placards the humor and pathos .                 @ @ @ @
