txt It seems to us fairly plain that ? what Prsident Eisenhower submitted to the United NatiOns yesterday is little more than a " working , paper " for future discussion on what to do about the Middle East . Yet if that is in some ways a disappointment , it is also a move that has its virtues . The world now has from the President the first reasoned explanation of the thinking that made the U.S. act in Lebanon . Equally important , the United States has now put before the world some concrete proposals on what might be done to bring some peace and security to that area without relying upon U.S. armed force . The proposals themselves are neither new nor startling . Some of them do not seem to have much hope of early accomplishment . And some of the most fundamental problems of that unhappy area are hardly dealt with at all . The plan for an Arab-run Middle East development organization , for example , must leap a very large hurdle in the fact that the oil-rich countries are not eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , we would not have so much trouble in. the Middle East now . So the President has given the U.N . Secretary General a very large order in suggesting that he negotiate that kind of cooperation among the Middle East Arab countries . Such suggestions as the one that the U.N . try to curb inflammatory propaganda in the area , or that it control arms shipments across borders , are far more difficult than they may sound . And at the best they are peripheral problems  --  the arms and the propaganda are results rather than causes of the basic trouble in the Middle East . The proposal for a U.N . police force also runs head-on into a widespread distrust among many countries , including this one , of anything that smacks of a supra-national power . At any rate the proposal has been rejected before by the United Nations . It is not likely to be accepted enthusiastically now if , as the President suggests , one of its functions would be to prop up governments such as the Hussein regime in Jordan . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isthat none of them come to grips with the Arab-Israel dispute , which is certainly one of the things at the very heart of the whole trouble . Yet after all these reservations have been duly noted , it still seems to us that the President has done much to recover lost ground and to contribute to a possible answer to the Middle Eastern problem . Until yesterday the United States position had seemed purely negative . Our intervention in Lebanon appeared no more than a hasty effort to halt a tide of rebellion , to maintain the status quo . We were ready targets for charges ( promptly exploited by Moscow ) that we were just propping up tottering regimes and had no sympathy for the aspirations of the Arab nations to get out from under Western domination , to have an " Arab destiny . " Now at- least we may escape tat box . The mere fact that Mr. Eisenhower went in person to the U.N . and made any proposals should itself regain us good-will and respect . And the proposals themselves do contain some germs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must begin with the Arab countries themselves points in the right direction ; it avoids the tired thought that the U.S. can win friends there , or solve Arab problems , by just plunking down some U.S. foreign aid . The development of some sort of U.N . force is probably a prerequisite to Having the U.N . tackle some of the real problems in the area , such as defining and enforcing boundary security . And the President has rescued the U.S. from the posture of being stubbornly " anti-Arab . " It is too much to say that one speech , means we now have a clearcut " policy " in the Middle East ; perhaps the whole thing is too complicated for such simplicity anyway . Certainly as much depends on future actions as on present words  --  how soon we can get our troops out of Lebanon , for example , or how our conduct shows the Arab countries we do believe they " clearly possess the right of determining and expressing their own destiny . " Thus the President 's working paper is only a beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in any problem so difficult as the Middle East a working paper is a necessary beginning .
