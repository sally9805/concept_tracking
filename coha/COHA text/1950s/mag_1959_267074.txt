Q. What becomes of old , broken-down wrestlers ? <P> A. Nothing . They are still wrestling . <P> Half fact and half fancy , the old gag is not really funny-not to wrestlers , at any rate . Out on the grunt-and-groan circuit the oldtimers are still working because the old act is still packing them in . Flabby characters who once had the lean , handsome muscle of the stock-company hero now fill in nicely as villains . And week after week , in more than 300 arenas across the country , the good guys tangle with the bad guys in the stylized , make-believe mayhem that has made professional wrestling one of the most prosperous trades in show business . Says bulb-nosed , cauliflower-eared Joseph ( " Toots " ) Mondt , the 12-year veteran of the mat and now one of the most successful wrestlers ' agents : " You do n't see punch-drunk , slap-happy wrestlers . I know at least 60 of them that got out of it rich , and no more harm to ' em than cauliflower ears . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , pro wrestling ai n't even a sport . It has not come close since the mid ' 30s , when the public began to tire of watching such " shooters " ( honest wrestlers ) as Jim Londos the Golden Greek and Ed ( " Strangler " ) Lewis sweat through stolid hours of dull , defensive wrestling . Then , as the gate receipts began to fall off , the beef trust made a discovery : wrestling fans are suckers for fancy holds with fanciful names . Any one of the new maneuvers could have wrecked a man for life ; yet everyone kept his health . It was obvious to the simplest fan that the bouts were fixed . But the crowds began to come back , and from a dead sport grew a new branch of show business . <P> No More Queens . In the post-World War II heyday , when everything on television was new and attractive , pro wrestling boomed . Desperate for new acts , new gimmicks , promoters began to push such gaudy huskies as " Gorgeous George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter seem even more ridiculous by his coy shenanigans in the ring and out . " The queens are passe now , " says Columnist Jimmy Cannon , but wrestlers are still getting away with their hammy histrionics , still faking pain , anguish and angry violence with steady success . <P> Now , whether the night 's show is in Washington , D.C. or Houston , St. Louis or Bridgeport , it is still a staple on TV . <P> The average card has a tag match ( two-man teams with the members taking turns mauling each other ) that eventually degenerates into a crowd-pleasing , pier-six free-for-all . Midgets may be there to jazz up the act . Here and there , where lenient local authorities permit it , women wrestlers appear to slap each other around . Someone is sure to take a mean-looking poke at the referee ( an illegal maneuver in Missouri ) ; someone is sure to heave someone else through the ropes ( never over ; that , too , is frowned upon ) .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
