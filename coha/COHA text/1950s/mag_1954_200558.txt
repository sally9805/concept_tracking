/f we wish to sell abroad , we must buy abroad . <P> - President Eisenhower , March 30 , 1954 The President 's foreign-trade program is , by his own definition , " a minimum program . " By now , however , he knows that even the minimum will not get through Congress this year . At most , Congress will approve some customs modifications , some tax incentives for investment abroad and a bare one-year extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act . Meanwhile , another important part of the freer-trade program has turned up on the President 's own doorstep . <P> Scissors &; Shears . A dozen U.S. industries have complained of imports reaching the " peril point " ( at which they are theoretically injured or threatened ) , and have applied for relief through higher tariffs . Two weeks ago , the Tariff Commission sent its recommendations to the White House on two such cases-one involving fish fillets , the other scissors and shears . Recommendations on the other ten cases are due soon . <P> In such cases the President faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the interests of industries that seek protection and the nation 's overriding interest in freer trade . In this election year some voters are likely to blame local unemployment on foreign imports . <P> Last week , nonetheless , the President decided against protectionism in the case of scissors and shears . The Tariff Commission had found that imports from Germany and Italy constituted " a definite threat of serious injury , " and recommended doubling the present 42% tariff . President Eisenhower canceled the increase on the ground that no imminent threat was proved . Among the other cases : Fishermen are aroused by groundfish fillet imports ( largely from Norway , Canada and Iceland ) , up from 9,000,000 Ibs. in 1939 to 107 million last year . Lead and zinc producers complain of shutdowns and layoffs in U.S. mines because " a flood of imports has demoralized the domestic mining industry . " Makers of woolen gloves and mittens charge that cheap imports ( mostly from Hong Kong and Japan ) have taken more than half the U.S. market , while half the industry 's 4,000 workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision on one current tariff case-the $58 million annual trade in Swiss watches and movements-will directly affect one Republican Senator up for reelection , Massachusetts ' Leverett Saltonstall , who has several watchmaking companies in his state . The Swiss make17-jewel movements for around $4 , less than half the U.S. production costs , and outsell American makers nearly 4 to 1 ( 8,600,000 to 2,300,000 annually ) in the U.S. <P> In 1952 President Truman turned down higher tariffs on Swiss watch imports , but Elgin , Hamilton and Waltham have again demanded peril-point protection . <P> They are opposed by Bulova , Gruen and about 100 other U.S. watch companies which rely on Swiss works . The free-trade argument : Switzerland consistently buys more here than she sells ( $458 million in the U.S. favor since the 1937 trade agreements ) . <P> Every Senate contest is important this fall and the President 's decision , affecting thousands of Massachusetts watchworkers , may hurt Senator Saltonstall 's chances .
