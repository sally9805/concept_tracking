INDOCHINA <P> On two hours ' notice , newsmen were called to Saigon 's colonnaded Palais Norodom , the seat of French government in Indo-China . There one day last week , beneath whirring fans and a lacquer painting of junks , they were confronted by the two top Frenchmen in Asia : Commanding General Henri Eugene Navarre , and Maurice Dejean , the Commissioner General . <P> The meeting was convened , the Frenchmen said , so they could deny press reports that there was friction between them . That settled , General Navarre lost no time getting into a defense of his 1953-54 campaign . " We have not been surprised , " said Navarre . " The situation is just what we expected ... " The Communists had not taken their current major objectives : the rice-rich Red River Delta around Hanoi , and the encircled French strongpoint at Dienbienphu . And their heavily headlined offensive against Luang Prabang , the royal Laotian capital , " may be considered blocked . " <P> Would Navarre care to predict victory next year ? The answer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be able to drive the enemy out of all the zones that are vital for the maintenance of his battle corps " ( presumably meaning that the Communists will still be a guerrilla problem , as in Malaya , but confinable ) . <P> Was Red China increasing its supplies to the enemy ? Answer : " Considerably . " <P> What about U.S. help in training the Vietnamese national army ? Answer : " It is absolutely unthinkable ... I could not but oppose . . . " <P> The questioners switched to the Commissioner General , who privately believes that the war must be won before negotiations . Dejean , apparently conscious of his duty towards his jittery superiors in Paris ( see above ) , was radiant at the prospect of the Far East conference in Geneva . " I am convinced that if we can get China to cease giving aid to the Communists , " beamed he , " a big step will have been taken on the road to peace . " He did not suggest 1 ) how this might be done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impolite enough to press him .
