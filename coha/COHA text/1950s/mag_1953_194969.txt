In London last week , the BBC somewhat nervously invited Sir Gerald Kelly to take charge of a TV tour of an exhibit of Dutch pictures at the Royal Academy . Sir Gerald , a peppery , blunt-talking , 74-year-old Irishman , is famed both as president of the academy and as painter of over 40 portraits of his wife ( " I paint her because I do n't think anyone has a prettier wife , " he once explained ) . <P> The program got under way with a staid , ten-minute monologue by the staid BBC 's Edward Halliday . Then Sir Gerald broke into Halliday 's lukewarm praise of a Rembrandt self-portrait . " My dear fellow , " he boomed , " that 's a bloody work of genius . " Pointing out a drop of water on a tulip , Sir Gerald cried : " Look at that confounded drop of water . Looks as if it might fall off any moment . That 's sheer damned skill . " Of Rembrandt 's A Man in Armour : " I just go all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the finest pictures in the world . In fact , it 's a bloody marvel ! " The program had now run 20 minutes over schedule , but Sir Gerald added : " You know , I get excited and carried away every time I come here . You must come and see the pictures . I get tight just looking at them . Come and see them . We 've got more in the kitchen . " <P> Shocked by all this uncensored enthusiasm , especially Sir Gerald 's uninhibited use of " bloody " and " damn , " BBC sat back to wait for protests . It is still waiting . Most of the letters from listeners urged : " Let 's have more of Gerald Kelly . " Attendance at the exhibit increased sharply . But the London Daily Express primly editorialized that Sir Gerald " brings honor neither to his position nor to himself by descending to the use of vulgar expletives . " Commented unrepentant Sir Gerald : " Did I say that the Man in Armour was a bloody marvel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
