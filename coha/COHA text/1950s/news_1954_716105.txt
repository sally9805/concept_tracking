txt WASHINGTON , March 2 ? Cancellation of the automatic reduction in corporation tax rates scheduled for April 1 was approved today by the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives . A provision continuing the levies for another year at present levels was adopted as part of a general tax reform bill , which is expected to- be reported later this week . The vote was 22 to 2 . The committee will act tomorrow on a separate measure- canceling automatic cuts scheduled for April 1 in some excise ( sales ) taxes . However , the bill would reduce many other excise levies , inejuding - " luxury " imposts ' on furs , jewelry , luggage , admissions , transportation and communications . Humphrey Opposes Cuts Approval appeared certain , even ? though George M. Humphrey , Secretary of the Treasury , issued a , statement tonight reiterating the Administration 's opposition to any general reduction in excises . He said that the Government could not afford it . This second bill , introduced today by the committee chairman , Representative Daniel A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for House consideration early next week : The reform measure , was listed for the following week . The two bills constitute a corn. - ptomise " package " devised some time ago by Representatives Reed and Richard M. Simpson , Republican of Pennsylvania , with the backing of the Speaker of the House , Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts . All of the proposals are part of President Eisenhower 's tax program , except for the proposed reductions in luxury taxes and ' other excises . Since the cuts are to be made in the same bill that provides for continuation of other excises at present rates , as recommended by the President , the Administration 's hands will be somewhat tied in opposing the reductions . Mr. Humphrey asserted that the Administration could not support a $1,000,000,000 cut in excises , but indicated a willingness to compromise . Ending Hardships Backed " The Treasury , " he said , " has been prepared for some time to concur in selective reductions of excises in particular hardship cases where industries were being badly hurt . by especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now proposed in the bill is more than the Treasury can afford at the present time . " The carefully developed relief provisions of the general tax , reivision bill , which the Ways and Means Committee now has under consideration , have the full and complete concurrence of the Treasury . " Millions of taxpayers . will ? receive benefits where relief is most needed and in the manner best calculated to encourage " initiative and make more and better peacetime jobs . " The reduction in revenue which this involves is- provided // CORPORATION CUT IN TAXES OPPOSED // far , in the budget and ' is all that the Treasury can now afford . " Quick House passage of both measures is in prospect , but a hard fight is shaping up there as well as in the Senate over Democratic proposals to increase personal income tax exemptions . The Democrats are pressing for a rise of at least $100 in the present exemptions of $600 each for taxpayers and their dependents . The increase is expected to be offered on the floor either as a substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The committee 's vote today was on President Eisenhower 's proposal to continue corporation taxes until April 1 , 1955 , at 30 per cent on the first $25,000 of earnings and 52 per cent on the rest . Present law calls for an automatic cut to 25 and 47 per cent , . effective April 1 . Cancellation of the reduction will save about $2,000,000,000 of revenue . However , other provisions of the far-reaching reform bill , including special credits on taxation of corporation dividends and faster tax write-offs on business outlays for plant expansion and modernization , involve revenue losses of about $1,300,000,000 in the first year . The measure , if enacted in its present form , would thus pick up a net of about $700,000,000 in revenue the first year . Only Representatives Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas and Noble J. Gregory of Kentucky , . both Democrats , voted against inclusion of the provision on corporation rates . Representative A. Sicl ? ney Camp , Democrat of Georgia , was absent . The Reed bill on excise taxes calls for the indefinite continuation of present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline and automobiles as recommended by the . President . Under present law ; they are due to drop generally by about 10 per cent on April 1 . The cancellation would save the Government about $1,100,000,006 in annual revenue . From . $900,000,000 to $1,000 , - 000,000 of the saving would be offset , however , by the bill 's provision for a reduction of all other excises , likewise effective April 1 . Under the Reed formula , the levy on products and services new taxed at more than 10 per cent of the price would be reduced to 10 per cent . This would mean a 50 per cent cut in the 20 per cent taxes on furs , cosmetics , jewelry , luggage , handbags and wallets , admissions to theatres and other places of entertainment , food and drinks bought in cabarets , club dues and initiation fees , photographic equipment , electric bulbs and tubes and leases on safe deposit boxes . The levy on long-distance telephone messages and-leased. wires , now 25 per cent , would go down to 10 per cent along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telegrams . Mr. ' Reed issued a statment deploring what ' he called the present " discriminatory system " of excise rates . He said that his bill would " give needed stimulation immediately to consumer purchasing power . " " changes will provide a more equitable tax system by leveling down those rates which are now excessively high and discriminating . "
