In the crowded last days of war , May 1945 , a convoy of Nazi trucks , speeding away from the advancing U.S. troops , was hastily abandoned in upper Austria , 37 miles east of Germany 's Berchtesgaden . One stalled truck yielded 23 chests crammed with expertly forged British 5 and 10 notes with total face value of several million dollars . At a lake near by , bank notes tossed overboard from a second truck began to float ashore . In the months that followed , U.S. Navy divers and British frogmen plunged to the 200-ft. to 250-ft. depths of Austria 's Toplitz Lake , and later at least three amateur searchers lost their lives seeking the phony treasure believed still hidden there . <P> Testing the Fakes . The mass counterfeiting of British money was an audacious Nazi trick with a double purpose : to undermine British currency and to finance Gestapo operations abroad . For special Section 6-F-4 of the Reich Security Office , it proved to be a tough job . It took top German engravers seven months to get a satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ) , and still longer to match the bluish rag paper that the real notes were printed on . Dates and serial numbers were carefully checked against real ones . At last came the test . A Gestapo agent took some of the bogus notes to a Zurich bank , said he was afraid that they were counterfeit , asked the Swiss to run tests on them . The bank even checked numbers with London and reported its verdict : the notes were genuine . <P> Soon a full-fledged counterfeiting plant was set up in isolated Block 19 of Sachen-hausen concentration camp under the supervision of SS Officer Bernhard Kriiger . His team of some 160 inmates , mostly Jews once employed in printing and banking , got special rations and good treatment . By early 1943 the Sachenhausen presses were turning out 250,000 bogus British notes each month . <P> Phony Payoff . To pass the British counterfeits , the Nazis installed a confederate in an Austrian castle , had him pass the bills in neutral countries in return for a one-third share of the profits . Gestapo informers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , also got paid off in the phony pounds . Among those doublecrossed : the Italians who found out where Mussolini was held before his rescue by Paratrooper Otto Skorzeny ; the famous valet " Cicero " ( real name : Eliaza Bazna ) , who stole secrets from the safe of the British Ambassador to Turkey . Ultimately , some of the counterfeit notes turned up in England . But only after duplications cropped up in serial numbers did the British realize what was happening . <P> Last week , financed by the enterprising German weekly Der Stern , a seven-man team of frogmen , equipped with an underwater TV camera , successfully brought up from the depths of Toplitz Lake 300,000 phony pounds in good condition , the first of an estimated 16 million believed hidden there . Scotland Yard only yawned : the British long ago had changed the design of their 5 and 10 notes . Just to be safe , Austrian police decided to destroy all the notes they could find .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
