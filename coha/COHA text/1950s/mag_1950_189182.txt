In the football season of 1949 , the world had paid too little attention to talented , towheaded Quarterback Eddie LeBaron of College of the Pacific , but that was not the fault of his fans in California 's San Joaquin Valley . After the 20-year-old wonder boy led Pacific ( en rollment : 1,250 ) through an undefeated season , San Joaquinites were aghast when Eddie got no higher national recognition , for the third straight year , than the " Little All-America . " Was that his penalty for playing with a school in football 's minor leagues ? To show how they felt , admirers showered him with gifts : a new Studebaker , a $1,000 diamond ring , two suits of clothes , matched luggage , a television set , a 12-gauge shotgun and a year 's supply of ammunition . <P> During the season his fans were just as loyal . When Sport Editor Bill Leiser of the San Francisco Chronicle dared suggest that Bob Celeri , the University of California 's " mad engineer , " was a better quarterback than Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad in front of the Chronicle Building . From the safety of a third-floor window , Sport Editor Leiser apologized and dutifully sang LeBaron 's praises . Four days later the Chronicle ran a Page One editorial calling for a game between mighty California and little Pacific . California , its sights set on the Rose Bowl , shrugged off the idea like a bear shrugging off a flea . <P> " We 'll Look Foolish . " Nothing came of it until last week when alert , 16s-lb . Quarterback LeBaron began whipping a squad of Pacific football seniors and alumni into shape . In the dead of winter , without the official blessing of either school , LeBaron was going to have his day in the Grape Bowl stadium in Lodi , Calif , against unpredictable , 175-lb . Engineer Celeri and a squad of California 's Golden Bears . Three enterprising University of California students had promoted the game and in the first three days had sold 4,000 tickets at $2.50 apiece in the valley alone . <P> In uniforms borrowed from San FranCisco 's pro football 4gers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Pablo Playground , and next day slipped quietly into Cal 's huge Memorial Stadium for practice . California Coach Pappy Waldorf was n't supposed to be helping , but he was-with calisthenics , signal drills and defensive patterns . Said Celeri , who , like LeBaron , was getting a $2,000 guarantee for his labors : " We want to win this one badly . . . Even if the game does n't actually mean anything , we 'll look awful foolish if we lose . " <P> Sensible Observation . This week , when the two quarterbacks squared off before an S.R.O . crowd of 24,218 , the flea bit the bear and put him on the run . LeBaron sent Halfback Bruce Orvis plunging over for the first touchdown and a mighty roar shook the bowl . Then the game degenerated into a huffing &; puffing contest between ill-conditioned athletes .
