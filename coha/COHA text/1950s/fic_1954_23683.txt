May 4 ? Tuesday T HE trouble with rich friends is that they are so expensive . This thought unfor- tunately only occurs to me after I have suggested that we have the Pulhnans to dinner , as they are at least two years overdue . I make the mistake of bringing this all up at luncheon when both children are there . Charles who is born hospitable says of course , high time , by all means , why not ? The " why not " makes me immediately against the idea as the Pullmans live grandly and I know that I will find myself trying to evolve a dinner that will appear equally grand . I decide that I will not discuss this aspect before Rachel and little Cissie as it will give them the wrong values , plus a poor impression of me . Charles goes on to say it must be small , not more than eight , so we can have General Conversation . This is an obsession of Charles ' which in my experience only produces a monologue by Host or Feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests of frightened anticipation that they will he called on for well-rounded opinions , or hurtfeelings if they are not . I suggest that we can bury the Pullmans better with twelve , whereupon Cissie who is , I am afraid , rather morbid , looks startled , puts both elbows on the table , rests her chin in her hands , and listens intently . Charles then says that is what I always do ? get nervous , lack confidence , and invite too many people , and one ends without getting the good out of anyone I argue that if we are going to have all the fuss of getting up a dinner , we might as well he hung for a sheep as a lamb . Why not Kill Off a few people ? Cissie starts breathing through her mouth . Charles remarks that we must n't jump the gun with anyone else until the Pullmans are well nailed down . Cissie breathes more loudly . And anyhow , continues Charles , he finds Pullman an interesting man in his own way . He is Chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Gloss Copper , and Charles has heard he is due for a big appointment in Washington , which is quite remarkable as five years ago ELO had tried to kick him upstairs . As Charles says this he laughs , whereupon Cissie , her eyes welling with tears , says you are all cruel to poor Mrs. Pullman ( whom I do not think she has ever seen ) and rushes from the table . Rachel automatically says , " Cry-baby , " and Charles , aghast , asks what has happened . We continue and finally agree on a compromise of ten , of which two besides the Pullmans as a concession to me may he Kill-Offs . I then suggest that we begin by trying to get a single man as that will give us something to play with and will be not only a spare tire , but an ace in the hole , and good insurance . There are always , of course , Dr. Harden and Mr. Case , but could n't Charles for once make that his department and find a New Single Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . . C HARLES asks why I am getting so excited , that of course he will get someone , and I am left stunned with surprise and gratitude . Rachel then says Please ask the two Miss Putnams because they told her the other day they never get invited anywhere and never never see any men . I say Not this time , some day later , and ask Charles what we shall have to eat . Charles says for God 's sake  --  not Ham , and why not pheasant ? Also he will arrange to get Old Tom from the Golf Club to help with the drinks but then it must not be a Saturday night when Tom is busy . Rachel then repeats Please ask the two Miss Putnams because they are so poor . I say Hush and she adds Why do we give pheasants to the Pullmans who are so rich anyhow ? It is n't Fair . Charles says Please shut up and Rachel adds that this is not true Democracy and Miss Licks her history teacher says that Thomas Jefferson , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal and to stay for weeks and weeks and that in a real Democracy . .. . I interrupt to say that Jefferson was lucky because he had lots and lots of slaves , and I wish I had , whereupon Rachel howls that it is simply awful to believe in slavery , even if she is not at the Civil War yet , and she certainly knows that Jefferson would have asked the two Miss Putnams to a dinner party , and in a real Democracy Miss Licks says . .. . ( Ponder to myself Rachel 's statement on hospitality of T. Jefferson which I know was fabulous but wonder why one never knows in history how the wives felt . Realize in all honesty that I can not remember if there wasa Mrs. J. Intend to look this up but know probably will not do so for some time . ) May 6 ? Thursday T HE plans for dinner party move ahead but undergo deep sea change . Mrs. Pullman and Mr. P. can only come on a Saturday  --  Old Tom therefore excluded  --  and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably an odd man . I try to sound nonchalant about this last possibility but am afraid my voice betrays me . She repeats she will let me know , soon , and then asks if Charles is better ? I say he has never been ill , but is writing a Book . Mrs. Pullman exclaims that oh she knew we had left the city and is glad to hear it was for nothing serious . ( Can not decide if this is humor . ) I in return inquire about Mr. Pullman , and Mrs. P. informs me she never sees him these days as of course he is so much in Washington . I say " of course " rather respectfully and kick myself for it . ( Wonder again why I always do this . Think it is a desire to be popular . ) Mrs. P. then asks after the little girls , calling them by wrong names which it does not seem worth while to correct . I inquire about her daughter , using the right name , Olivia , and Mrs. Pullman tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impending examinations at her school . Olivia is brilliant , exceptionally so , but alas no student . We again repeat date , hour , Black Tie , and she will let me know in Plenty of Time . The other Kill-Offs , known as my Concession , are the Lawlers , long overdue , who accept . Charles having pleaded that we have at least one person we like , I ask the Tracys , and even go so far as to explain the whole situation to Maud and tell her that she and Hick are the only couple we really want . Maud replies that she Kills Off with cocktails , period , and would never waste a dinner on Lawlers or Pullmans . I then hear myself telling her that George Pullman is an interesting man about to take a big post in Washington . Maud answers she is surprised that impresses a Democrat like me and I answer that I call myself an Independent with Democratic leanings , which produces only a cackle from Maud . She then says that Saturday is a hard night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be able to loan me her Annie . Will have to see . I tell her this will Solve Everything . HARLES then produces his surprise . He has telephoned to reactivated Army Base thirty-four miles away and invited General McQuinn , whom he has met once . He is , says Charles , a two-star West Pointer , and handsome . I am quite overcome . Has he accepted ? No , but Charles has spoken to his Aide who says the General has nothing laid on and will telephone us later . I go into happy anticipatory dream of effect on Maud when glittering General marches in . It then appears relatively safe ( with Pullman odd man and General ) to ask extra woman , and extend invitation to Mary Singer , who is not only Head of distinguished Girls ' School and great Brain but  --  surprisingly  --  attractive . Miss Singer says she rests on weekends but as I have said it will be small , she will come . She and I have after all that bond of having worked for Stevenson and flatteringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell this to Charles ( who voted for Eisenhower for the usual reasons ) he begs me not to turn the evening into a political brawl , the election is over , and why not let the dead bury their dead . This extraordinary statement I can not let pass and we find ourselves in a near brawl , only to be interrupted by the telephone . There is a click and a crackle and a masculine voice says , " Connect with Quarters One . " Then buzzing and signals and another voice announces , " Sergeant Tremont , Quarters One . " First voice says , " Ready on call placed by Major Sylvester , at thirteen hours , for General McQuinn , party on wire . " " Yes , Sir , " responds Sergeant Tremont . I prepare a very charming smile which wipes itself offmy face when a soft voice says , " Hullo there , this is Dolly McQuinn . " I reply , " Oh yes , " meaning Oh NO ! " The General and I will be pleased to accept your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formal ? " I put my hand over mouthpiece and say to Charles , " Married ! " and then express delight and say it 's a small dinner party ( which it is no longer ) and Black Tie . Then think of General 's uniform which I at all costs want , but do not know how to phrase in military terms . Dolly then states she has a short evening dress , formal at the " top " and with a jacket . I say How lovely  --  start to give road directions and Dolly cries Oh the Aide will take care of that . Then have Brain Storm , or Stroke of Genius , and ask her if Major Sylvester is married . Heavens , no , replies Dolly , an Aide is no good if he 's married . Would he possibly enjoy also ? ? Certainly . She will bring him . ( Order him ? ) My opinion of Dolly is now extremely high , and as I hang up I reflect that , hard as the life in the Armed Services must he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiasco of the marital status of the General , admits I have been adroit and I go into happy fantasy that if Major Sylvester proves attractive , can get him over again when dear Linda returns from college . May II  --  Tuesday p ARTY now completely out of hand and adds up to at least fifteen . Mrs. Pullman telephones that she is overjoyed to hear that the Bromleys are going to be with them  --  of course I know who they are  --  and she will bring them . They always contribute so . I again approach the Odd Man . Mrs. Pullman does not understand what I am referring to . The names , she repeats , are Mr. 8 : : Mrs. Estabrook Bromley . Later I suggest we make dinner a buffet and Charles says this is the last straw . He has never been to a buffet which was not confused and messy . I then give him a vivid description of new type buffet , a half-and-half , with bottles of wine on tables , which I have read about and even seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account by saying of course grouse is out and it looks like Ham . Charles asks how he is supposed to concentrate on his book if he has to consider these petty details . He then adds for God 's sake not to stick around that Chilean wine in black bottles , left over from the War Years . He will take care of the wine  --  leave that at least to him . It is not the moment to remind him of the cavity left by Old Tom . May 17 ? Monday M AKE up my mind to be clear-headed and authoritative , and write out on pad what I plan to have for dinner party . Will then go into kitchen and simply tell Una . Rehearse conversation . Must not begin with , " Oh by the way , Lina , we are having a few people in , " which is cowardly , nor , " Give me your suggestions , Lina , " which is craven , but go into kitchen , say , " GOod morning , " bring out my pad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a small dinner of about eighteen people . ( Find I am talking into the mirror and the face that looks out at me resembles Uriah Heep . ) Decide instead to go to Mary Jane 's Beauty Shoppe . Know it is several days before the party but do not wish Mrs. Pullman to imagine that the dinner is so important to me that my hair has been especially waved for it , and feel it is more worldly to have it on the night either a bit overripe or underdone . Will have to produce this effect by brushing it hard or not combing it at all for five days . On arrival home Rachel says Oh you have had your hair washed , why , and then adds casually that Lina has been stumping around for hours as she . wants to Talk to me . With prophetic foreboding , know this is to give notice , as it is euphemistically called , and I can see she has so timed it that she can comfortably catch the afternoon train . Debate whether I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for Long Distance or an accident . Recall that hopeful period when I had dreamed that Lina might fall in love with Charles , which friends have told me is the only way nowadays to hold anyone . But in three months have seen no evidence of a rising passion on Lina 's part though in the first few weeks had urged Charles to go into kitchen and alternate between praise and jollying along . March out toward kitchen with reproachful look already planted on my face , and run head on into Lina in Library who says she hears I am giving a dinner of twenty-six . Before I can make my denial she adds she has already reserved a salmon . The relief is too great , I find my eyes full of hysterical tears , and I sink to the sofa . Lina joins me on it and I show her pictures of new-type buffet , in color . Lina says it looks Krazy , like old restaurant in Pest . Later describe episode to Charles slanting it to sound as though only extraordinary diplomacy on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Charles says that as a small child I must have been bitten by a cook and the marks still show . May 20 ? Thursday AUD telephones that I can have her Annie , but Annie has stipulated she will under no circumstances go into t le kitchen , as she does not like Tina because of her religion . ( As Lina has never asked to go to Church can only assume it is because of her lack of it . ) Maud then adds that Hick will drive Annie over Saturday in the afternoon . I am overcome at this gesture of Hick 's and I tell Maud that I know Charles would never do anything so thoughtful . Maud agrees that he would not and then adds that some day he may have to . Can see there will come a return engagement and I will have to contribute my pound of flesh . Secure Mrs. Biltz from village , who cleans and will go into kitchen or anywhere else but only if she can bring along her cat . As Mrs. Biltz does not mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cissie that Taffy and Joe must be shut upstairs . Invite Dr. Harden , who to my surprise can not come , so fall back on Mr. Case , who of course can . Am aware that he will be the symbol to Maud and the Lawlers that I have scraped the barrel . Decide I will place him next to Mrs. Fstabrook Bromley with the faint hope that she will think he is an exciting new man . Later in the evening after Charles has gone to bed , start moving furniture about to see if I can produce the effect I am after . On third attempt at grouping decide to put two tables in larger living room and make long table in hall into buffet . Get this well under way pushing sofas against walls and am quite delighted with what I am achieving when Charles appears in his wrapper and wants to know what I am making all the noise about , and do I know it is one-thirty ? I explain my plan , and Charles asks why we can not eat in the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charm and will make everyone feel informal and gay , but as I say this I recognize that five of the guests I have never laid eyes on and who knows what will egayer them . Charles looks more and more depressed and to sugar the pill I add that if he will imagine he is at a jolly restaurant , then at his table he can have General Conversation , while at my table we can tete-a-tete . Charles says that if I am going to try to move the piano now lie might as well help me , which he does , and then we agree it looks better in its old corner so we shove it back again . I go to the pantry and bring back some beer , which we drink , each at his own table . I ask Charles if he does not now see how amusing it will be , but he gives The so bleak a look I see it is indeed time to go to bed . May 22 ? Saturday T T FOUR in the afternoon as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sports roadster with Annie by his side . Annie steps out carrying a small valise , and I speculate as to why on a journey of four miles she has to wear a traveling costume and can not arrive already uniformed for the evening . Annie marches in through the front door and disappears , heavens knows where , to her dressing room . At the same moment with a roar of a throttle wide open , a motorcycle sweeps up , with a side car , out of which steps a khaki lieutenant . He is about to ring the bell when from around the corner appears Mrs. Biltz leading a cat , who has a collar on , by a chain . The lieutenant and Mrs. Biltz fall into low conversation , as he looks at the cat , and she is obviously having a hard time convincing him of something , but finally with a last skeptical look at the house , he jumps into the side car and bang-bangs off . Mrs. Biltz takes the path to the back door with pussy . T wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed ( hair brushed hard ) , and encounter Charles , with Rachel and Cissie , carrying bottles . Rachel and Cissie are doubling for Old Tom , and Charles has agreed that Cissie may wear her Spanish costume  --  a gift from Julie  --  but without the tambourine . The plot of the buffet is unveiled for Annie and Mrs. Biltz , and Annie views it with the same pessimism as Charles ; Mrs. Biltz makes only two statements  --  that she hates to pass , and that that Cissie is sure a cute hag of tricks . I visit the kitchen , which is quite smoky , and say to Lina , who is crouched on her knees in front of the oven , that it all smells delicious . Lina does not reply so I add that I know everything is going to be wonderful . ( Would feel more secure if this assurance came from her . ) Lina finally turns and says that yellow is my color . Am once again overcome by beautiful yet surprising nature of Lina . Would like to urge her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not wish there to be an early encounter with Annie . Tell her Mrs. Biltz will bring in the food , whereupon I.ina says will attend to that , no butterfingers on her dishes . See that meeting with Annie inevitable and can only hope that like old Troopers the show will go on . Give Lina a last warning that dinner may be a little delayed because of cocktails , and Lina asks rhetorically at what dinner has it ever been otherwise ? Return to the big hall and find Charles with Rachel and Cissic still hurling bottles about so that what was intended to be a scene of elegance , and somewhat like an interior French Conversation Piece of the nineteenth century , now resembles a rather any speakeasy . Ask Charles how he likes my dress and he says it looks all right . Ask if he can not say anything more and lie finally remarks that it is a little top-heavy . I indignantly inquire what he means as the whole point is its simplicity and he answers he still thinks it would look better with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that he is discussing the buffet and agree with him that there are too many grapes in one bowl . By then it is too late to re-introduce the subject of my appearance . AT TEN minutes to eight just as I am light- ing all the candles in all rooms , there is the bell . I say to Charles I am sure it is Mr. Case , which it is . After a quick glance about Mr. Case exclaims that he sees we have begun our alteration and he admires us for having a dinner at this time . What spirit ! He then spies the buffet around the corner and cries , how utterly charming  --  it is like a Grandma Moses print . As there are spring flowers everywhere and I myself have given the silver so high a polish that it is almost blue , I find this remark singularly inappropriate . We move into the smaller sitting-room , where there is a fire lit which shines on the French andirons and pale brocaded portieres , and I wait too have it recall to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he is too absorbed in explaining to Charles how to make " my kind of cocktail . " This is described as weak , weak , but I observe that when Charles inquires if that is about right Mr. Case suggests perhaps a finger or two more of Bourbon , which eventually Rachel hands to him . He then , with a glance at Rachel , tosses over his shoulder to me that he can see that there is a certain somebody in this room ? who is destined to be a little hea.rtbreaker , at which Rachel gives a rather silly smile . There is a further flurry in the hall and I can hear Maud and Hick greeting Annie as though they had not seen her in years . Theyare followed by the Lawlers , and Beatrice Lawler whom I have never thought of as particularly perceptive exclaims over and over again that it is all too too divine and she could n't be more impressed . T HE bell rings again ( I making a mental note that it is too loud and at least in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Charles go out , and hear voices preponderantly masculine . Charles then ushers in the General and Mrs. McQuinn followed by Major Sylvester . The General and the Major are in uniform with many ribbons across their chests , and the General is indeed handsome . Mrs. McQuirth is blonde and pink and smiling , and wears an orchid . The effect on Maud and Beatrice is electric as I nonchalantly assume that of course they have'met General and Mrs. McQuinn and the Major  --  which I know full well they have not ? and Mrs. McQuinn impresses me by repeating each nameclearly as I make the introductions ; tells Cissic she has a youngster who has a Hawaiian costume , and that Cissie and Rachel , again putting the right name on the right child , must come over to the Post and visit with her . Major Sylvester , who resembles an exceptionally bright squirrel , immediately assists Charles with the cocktails . He is a veritable Old Tom in his efficiency , disappears to the pantry an.c1 returns with a coke with which he makes a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McQuinn . He instinctively knows that Mr. Case is waiting anxiously for another cocktail and hands it to him at full strength . He prepares the General 's drink with great rapidity and at the same time keeps up a lively conversation with Beatrice Lawler who has planted herself in that unassailable position of attraction  --  next to the ice-bucket . Again the - bell tolls and Cissie who has moved on guard out front announces to me in a whisper that it is poor Mr. Pullman . The Pullmans with the Bromleys march in and the room immediately seems very crowded as all four are extremely large . Mrs. Pullman is in gray chiffon with a great many pearls , and Mrs. Bromley is exceptionally smart in black and white , which emphasizes the silvered streak in her black hair . She tells Charles in a penetrating voice she is simply terrified as she hears he is writing a Book . This casts a momentary pall over everyone until Mr. Bromley cries that it takes all sorts to make a world , old man , does n't it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the General and leads him three feet outside the circle , where he engages him in solemn conversation with a portentous look on his face . A 's the General has been invented by Charles , find I resent this kidnapping by Mr. Pullman so early in the evening . Beatrice Lawler however quickly joins them , to the apparent pleasure of the General and frustration of Mr. Pullman . . AN NIE now appears to signal that dinner is ready and I signal not yet  --  one more ; and two minutes later Mary Singer walks in , looking charming in a plum-colored dinner dress and infinitely younger than any of her contemporaries , largely due I think to her beautiful carriage and relaxed manner . Introductions are made and suddenly I see an expression like consternation on the face of Mrs. Pullman as she shakes Miss Singer 's hand . I am at a loss to understand this and am further confused when 1 see her trying to attract the attention of Mr. Pullman , who ever again captured the General and pelled him away from Beatrice Lawler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wants anything ( sounding like a floorwalker ) and she says she knows it is an odd question , but is her husband by any chance to be placed near Miss Singer ? I tell her at the same she can , as we all follow Charles and Mrs. McQuinn in to dinner . The General , who is seated next to me , proves immediately to be an old Pro and makes himself agreeable within three seconds . He wants to know where I have been all his like . I remind him  --  the likeness is marked ? of a woman , an outstanding beauty , he once knew back in Nanking . Have I been married before ? He could swear he has seen me somewhere  --  now could it have been in Manila ? There were many pretty girls there and he never forgets a face . I find this delightful and am only too willing to trace our first acquaintance to the time he ruled Babylon and I was a mere Christian slave , when Mr. Pullman who is on my other side booms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just one question , and if our charming hostess will forgive him , he thinks it will interest our whole table . The General immediately assumes an intent expression and Mrs. Bromley cries How simply fascinating . Mr. Case attempts to look profound , which merely makes him appear anxious , and Joe Lawler quickly fills his glass . from one of the bottles against what may be a long drought . Mary Singer fixes her calm gaze on Mr. Pullman and I refuse to catch Maud Tracy 's eye . What Mr. Pullman wishes to know , and he will state it in simple terms , what he would like to have from the General , is his opinion as to whether the military cuts in the Budget have not vastly increased the efficiency of the Defense Establishment ? B EFORE however the General can even swallow , Mr. Pullman continues . He has only just returned from Washington  --  here he pauses and there is a murmur from the table  --  and he saw among many other officials , his good friend George Humphrey . At this Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government and there are general expressions of approval . ? Mr. Pullman goes on . He does not wish to be quoted but George Humphrey has assured him that the country is in a healthy condition , and sound . And it will become even sounder in Mr. Pullman 's opinion as the budget is balanced simultaneously with taxes being cut , Mary Singer here intervenes and remarks that for her money , which she states it ultimately will be , she would rather have a lot more military power , and she deplores the cuts . And , she adds , she is sure that the General agrees with her . Mr. Pullman looks surprised and addresses Miss Singer as my dear young lady ( showing that he is not aware of her identity ) . He tells her it is a basic rule not to spend what you have n't got , and he for one is happy that at long last America is having a business Administration made up of men who understand that simple fact . Miss Singer retorts that the Executive branch may be filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , Congress , Mr. Pullman replies , and looks a little depressed . F L RTHERMORE , Miss Singer continues , if the country is so healthy and so sound , it can indeed afford the proper military posture for defense and attack ; that it should be our overriding policy to achieve this first priority , and she can only conclude from Mr. Pullman 's remarks , that the country has not the money for this , because , and here she fixes Mr. Pullman with her eye , because we are in a Recession , and perhaps headed for something much worse . Mr. Pullman gives a gasp , and Mrs. Bromley asks Mr. Lawler quite audibly who that woman is . Mr. Pullman now reduces Mary Singer to my dear Madam . We are , my dear Madam , he informs her , in a period of readjustment which is particularly healthy . We expect this year , based on total business activity , to be the highest in our history . If the backlog of orders is perhaps down it is only one of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure . Mrs. Bromley cries that this is wonderfully put , and does n't the General agree ? Mary Singer , ignoring Mrs. Bromley , says Look at the Farmers . Mr. Pullman , his face quite rosy , cries that the farmers should beware of being led by radicals or they will he in serious trouble , eh General ? Mary Singer announces that the next election will show ! The next election ! exclaims Mr. Pullman as one who is still licking his wounds from the last one . Feel that at all costs must put an end to this interchange and rescue the General from his position between the crossfire , so spring to my feet and announce that everyone must help themselves to the next course . The General propels me by my elbow to the buffet and I try to re-establish the mood of our earlier encounter at Nanking , but do not feel I am entirely successful . I see Mrs. Pullman maneuver herself next to her husband and give him a telegraphic message at which he shows astonishment . But I have in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directive which is for God 's sake to serve up some champagne , at which he shows even greater surprise than Mr. Pullman . When I return to the table I find that Mr. Pullman has moved his seat and is next to Mary Singer , with his arm across the back of her chair and an atmosphere of marked intimacy . To say that his manner is fawning would be exaggerated but words such as " how absolutely right you are " and " that point is well taken " float over to me . AQrA1-i We all accordingly change places and I find Mr. Case beside me . Mrs. Bromley sits next the General and I have a suspicion that they too may have met in Manila , only to hear them in a discussion of Deep Freezes , and which birds should be plucked or frozen as are . The General is vivacious and Mrs. Bromley asks his advice on the correct gauge for woodcock . I realize that I have underestimated Mrs. Bromley . Annie and Mrs. Biltz appear carrying bottles of champagne and Major Sylvester suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband wishes him to turn on the Gramophone and will I direct him as to where I have placed the dance records . Feel that Charles is under the misapprehension that the Major is now his Aide and start to apologize when the General snaps his fingers at the Major and says out of the corner of his mouth , Rumbas . W E ALL dance save Mr. Pullman and Mary Singer , who remain absorbed in each other . Estabrook Bromley , like all heavy men , is extremely light on his feet , and Mr. Case to the surprise of everyone requests a tango , for which we have no music . The General however is the master , and dances with incredible skill , changing . partners punctiliously and never pausing for breath . He tells me that Dolly can do a very beautiful Hula , which she learned when they were stationed at Hickman in Hawaii , and I exclaim if only she would . Of course she will , declares the General and then barks out , " Major , Lovely Hands . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its approximation sings softly through the room , as Dolly , introduced by Charles , throws off her little jacket , puts the orchid in her hair , and dances exquisitely with her pretty hands moving in and out as she circles around us . There is thunderous applause and I pray to myself that this success will not inspire Beatrice Lawler to sing " I Love Susie . " Itdoes however , and it is a distinct anticlimax . The Major , sensing with Aide-like subtlety that this is enough of individual performances , now plays " Liza , " " Embraceable You , " and " Here in My Arms , " and we all dance again . At a certain moment the General , Dolly , and the Major , by some understood but unseen signal , all leave their partners and say good night , Dolly again remembers each name as she shakes hands and again repeats her invitation that one and all are to come over and lunch with her at the Base . Charles says to the General that he hopes his car is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not even worthy of an answer . As I walk toward the door I think but am not sure that the Major , as he steps into the front scat of the low-slung , khaki-colored Buick next to a sergeant at the wheel , is carrying a record under his arm . s lim-TIN after this the others begin to take their leave . Mr. Pullman can hardly bear to tear himself away from Mary Singer and there is a last word to her that he hopes that she will read his address made to the Retailers of America which he will send to her . She might have missed it and he has had it printed for distribution among friends . Mrs. Pullman invites us to a luncheon and the Bromleys declare that they had thought of buying in these parts but they can see it is far too gay . The Lawlers depart with that look of going on somewhere , and I try to explain to Mary Singer how the party grew and why , and we arrange to meet soon . I go to search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , both laughing loudly , which they immediately check when I enter and which convinces me it has been at my expense . Dear Maud and Hick drive Annie off between them , Annie clutching that little white envelope and looking I think slightly intoxicated . Charles handsomely acknowledges that the party has been a success but can not understand why I ordered up all the champagne . Decide not to give him my real motivation but instead ask him if he does not now agree it has been delightful to eat in the sitting room . Charles however reiterates that dining-rooms are for dining .
