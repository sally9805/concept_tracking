The Mudlark ( 20th Century-Fox ) , based on Theodore Bonnet 's 1949 bestseller , embroiders the legend of the slum waif whose naive devotion to the Crown coaxed Queen Victoria out of a 15-year solitude and awakened Parliament to its social responsibilities . Produced in England by U.S. moviemakers , the picture drew some British sniping , even before the cameras turned , for its casting of Irene Dunne as the Queen . The sniping was resumed when the film was picked as Britain 's Command Performance movie in November . <P> U.S. moviegoers-and most Britons , for that matter-will look hard , and probably in vain , to find any real grounds for controversy . Some in both countries may object that the movie treats its royalty with the special deference that Hollywood reserves for visiting dignitaries . But the story 's stuffiness , as well as its sentimentality , has been filigreed with humor , and Producer-Scripter Nunnally Johnson has knowingly worked the combination into an enjoyable film . <P> The movie 's awe of the Queen and her handsome surroundings proves an excellent foil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragamuffin ( Andrew Ray ) , who absently spews a trail of plum pits as he wanders bug-eyed through the imposing halls and chambers . The picture also unbends enough to twit Victorian manners &; morals . <P> At the head of an otherwise all-British cast , Actress Dunne shares honors with her make-up man for a competent , unspectacular performance . As Disraeli , Alec ( Kind Hearts and Coronets ) Guinness gives a superb reading of a long , eloquent speech in the House of Commons , turning the mudlark 's adventure into an affair of state . Most of the time , however , Guinness plays with a mincing air that suggests Richard Haydn 's caricature of an over-prim Englishman . The Mudlark owes its best performances to Finlay Currie , playing an outspoken , sozzled old Scot in the Queen 's service , and eleven-year-old Actor Ray , who is altogether winning as the grimy orphan who wants a peek at the mother of the British Empire . <P> Mr. Music ( Paramount ) is a long , tired musicomedy so closely tailored to Bing Crosby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in fact , appears to be doing just that . Typed again as a lazy , breezy dodger of responsibility , Crosby this time is a famous Broadway lyricist-composer who just wo n't settle down to work on Producer Charles Coburn 's new show . Coburn hires prim Secretary Nancy Olson to discipline Bing . Love blooms , misunderstandings loom , Crosby croons , and the show goes on ( with guest stars including Groucho Marx , Dorothy Kirsten and Peggy Lee ) . The general effect , devoid of zest or originality , is more like a radio variety show than a movie . Hardened Crosby fans will probably like it , but others might do well to season their popcorn with benzedrine . <P> Harvey ( Universal-International ) , as playgoers learned in 1944 , is an invisible rabbit well over six feet tall , the boon companion of a gentle , friendly lush named Elwood P. Dowd . The movie adapters of Mary Chase 's Pulitzer Prize comedy have blessedly resisted the temptation to coax Harvey into full view. * Up to a point , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daffy charm and prankish fun , and they have kept all of Josephine ( Arsenic and Old Lace ) Hull as its fluttery leading lady .
