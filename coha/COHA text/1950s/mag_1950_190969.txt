Considering the way the Rana family of Nepal came to power 104 years ago , it was scarcely surprising last week to find that the Ranas had won another match against Nepal 's royal family . Watching their beaten King fly away in an Indian government airplane , the good people of Kathmandu could shake their turbaned heads and murmur the Nepalese equivalent for : " They never come back . " <P> The Ranas won the championship of Nepal in a gory elimination tournament in 1846 . The reigning monarch at that time was Rajendra Bikram Sahi , a blue-blooded Rajput ( Hindu warrior caste ) and a descendant of Vishnu the Lifesaver . For all that , the King was nuttier than a pecan tree in October . He and the Queen persuaded one of their generals , Jung Bahadur Rana , to murder their Prime Minister , who happened to be Jung Bahadur 's uncle . Then Jung Bahadur helped the King murder the Queen 's lover . She was put out about this , but not at the King , who seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grains . Nor was she angry with Jung Bahadur . Instead , she assembled all the nobles of Nepal and accused them of plotting to murder her paramour . Obligingly , Jung Bahadur helped her kill 55 nobles and 500 lesser folk . The Queen was so pleased that she made Jung Bahadur Prime Minister . He knew what to do next . Two months later he exiled the King and Queen , and put their minor son on the throne at Kathmandu . <P> Since then , as anyone would expect , the Kings of Nepal have been Kings in name only , and the Ranas have been hereditary Prime Ministers . They made a good thing out of it . Half of Nepal 's $10,000,000 state revenue finds its way to members of the Rana family . One Rana is said to own 300,000 acres of land , which would be a big farm even in Texas , but is enormous in the Himalaya-topped little land of Nepal . <P> Nowadays there are 80 subfamilies of the Rana clan . All of their legitimate sons are automatically appointed major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illegitimate sons of the Ranas become lieutenant colonels . ( Some U.S. Army captains see a similarity between American and Nepalese practices in this respect . ) <P> Meanwhile , the Kings languished in obscurity . They retained the right to throw barley grains to the people on festival days , and they continued to bear the honorary title Sri Sri Sri Sri Sri , * which is sometimes written Sr15 . ( The Rana Prime Ministers bear the lesser title Sri Sri Sri , or Sr13 . ) <P> Special Delivery . The present King , Sri Sri Sri Sri Sri Tribhubana Bir Bikram Jung Bahadur Shah Bahadur Shum Shere Jung Deva , came to the throne in.ign when he was five . Little is known of him except that he is said to be able to ride two horses at the same time , one foot on each . Also , he married two sisters on the same day .
