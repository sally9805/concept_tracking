 | In a movie the family had just seen , Ginger Rogers had fascinated the spectators by her seemingly effortless execution of intricate dance steps . So I was not surprised when my twelve-year-old daughter said to me , on the way home , " Mother , may I take dancing lessons ? " I smiled inwardly , with a warm feeling of understanding , but I was cautious . " Do you want the lessons enough to work for them ? " I asked . " Oh , yes ! " So we cooked up a plan whereby Nell earned the money for dancing lessons by helping me with the family ironing . At dancing class , she stood on her head , did back bends and cart wheels , twirled , and leaped . One day she came home bubbling over with excitement about the spring program the class was going to present in the college auditorium . Then came the blow . A program entails a costume , and it developed that the fabric alone for Nell 's costume , which I was to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a hat and a parasol , and I figured these items would make the price of the complete costume between $15.00 and $20.00 . All this for five minutes on the stage ! " I 'd like to talk to your teacher about it , " I said to Nell . " I 'm sure that fifteen @#  | dollars is more than most people in this town can afford for a costume , and I 'd like to suggest that something simple be used instead . " " No , Mother , I do n't want you to . " said Nell . " It 's her business , and I 'd rather not be-in the program than have you talk to her . " Evidently , Nell was afraid I would embarrass her , so we went over the problem some more , and I gave her this choice : I would advance the money for the costume , in which case ( as it was a decided luxury ) , her allowance and earnings would be mortgaged for months ahead ; or she could discuss the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was that she . went to the teacher and explained that she could n't be on the program because the costume was too expensive ! Then I began to be haunted . " We rob tomorrow 's memories by today 's economies , " says John Mason Brown . I worTied for fear Nell would always remember , with resentment , that she had once been scheduled to appear in a dance program and could n't perform because the expense involved . If she had stubbornly opposed me and insisted on my buying the costume , I would have felt that her sense of values was all wrong and that I was right in stressing the foolishness of spending more money for a costume she would wear for a few minutes on a stage than we had ever spent for a dress she might wear for several seasons . But because my daughter had made a sensible decision , I feared I had imposed it on her from the lofty and unassailable height of parenthood .  | I spoke to a friend about my worry . " Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember ? My mother struggled ? yes , and really sacrificed ? so that I could have fancy dance costumes when I was a little girl . And when I wanted to go to college , she did n't have a penny to help me . " It was then that I asked myself the question , What ought we to afford ? For we certainly could have afforded even $20.00 for the costume ? if we had felt that such an expenditure was right , or necessary , or valuable . We could have afforded it had we been willing to agree that we could justifiably spend our money on the next luxury , and the one after that . But we felt that such expenditures would eventually make us unable to afford something that might be of far greater value . MY HUSBAND is a college professor , so it is obvious that our income is not in the upper brackets . But it seems to me that except in the case of extreme poverty , the question most of us have to decide is , What ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford ? Perhaps the problem is even more difficult for those who have more money ; they must decide what expenditures are good for their children . Being a parent is like walking a tightrope . On one side are the pitfalls of laxity ; on the other , the dangers of too much discipline . When we try to right ourselves after leaning too far to one side , we often fall off on the other . I am never sure I am right about anything , but I usually feel that I know more about last year 's problems than about this year 's . And so , perhaps , I am writing this article to clarify my thinking for the future ; or perhaps I am writing it to defend myself from my children ! At any rate , I feel fairly certain that a number of parents are in the same boat . At our house , we try to give the children a realistic approach to the problems of spending . We want them to know that it is more important to have money for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is more important to own a home than to have the biggest collection of toys on the block ; that the things we possess usually are more fun and more highly valued if we work to get them . Putting across these ideas is a big order , and I do n't mean to pretend that we always succeed . Life is too short to be spent lecturing . But there are times when a parent can make his point of view clear to a child , Last year , our eleven-year-old son began to play in the school band , using a cornet belonging to the school . Soon he began to make remarks about " this old instrument , " suggesting that a new cornet could be bought for about seventyfive dollars and that it would be nice to have one of his own . We countered with the suggestion that if he really thought he must have his own cornet , he could work to earn half of the money for it . Hardhearted ? I do n't think so . We thought that his work- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure and also give us time to know whether his interest was real or just a passing whim . As it turned out , he abandoned the cornet and now plays the French horn ( another instrument belonging to the school ) ; so far , he has not mentioned buying a horn .  | Each person who asks himself the question , What ought I to afford ? will doubtless come up with a different answer . We do n't all have ? nor should we have ? the same sense of values . In our household , there are many things we think our children ought to have : books and magazines ; football , baseball , basketball , tennis , and fishing equipment ; piano lessons ; tools to encourage handwork of various kinds . From our point of view , these are possessions that pay off well in the development of our children . The record player , too , we felt was a justifiable expense , for it will give all of us years of enjoyment . Perhaps I buy a piano recording to indulge my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sullivan album , knowing that the whole family will love it . Spike Jones ? Well , yes ; but the children understand that if they want Spike Jones , they must pay for the records themselves , out of allowance or earnings . Does this mean we buy nothing frivolous for our children ? Of course not ! Any system that is completely arbitrary occasionally breaks down , and the exceptions to our rules might seem ridiculous to other parents . In the big things , however , we try to apply the test of value in considering expenditures . NO FAMILY exists in a vacuum , and perhaps the greatest problems parents face in guiding their children arise from the fact that other parents in the neighborhood have entirely different standards . But does this really matter ? Sometimes when a child says , " All the girls are getting new dresses for the party , " a little get-together among the mothers discloses that " all " really means " a few . " After all , our children are going to live in a world where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some people will have fewer . Last summer , five of our children 's friends went to summer camp ? to the tune of five hundred dollars apiece . Such an expenditure was entirely out of the question for us , but we did n't lose any sleep over it . And neither did our children , I 'm sure . It was easy to make a successful substitution ? though " substitution " is n't a good enough word , for our summer activities were valuable in themselves , and we never thought of them as substitutes for something else . We took a car trip ? and family trips should be savored to the full by parents of children who are approaching their teens , for the time will come all too soon when the fledglings prefer to go off by themselves . We had picnics in the back yard , short fishing jaunts , hot-dog and marshmallow roasts . Recently , a friend of mine told me that her little boy had said to her when he was going to bed the night before , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ? because his dad makes more money than mine . " We both laughed over the story , but I 'm not sure it expresses a basic truth . We all know that people often buy cake when they have n't enough bread . If we had a lot more money than we now have , would we give our children more luxuries ? Oh , I suppose we would give them some more , because it is n't human to withhold from those we love if we have the means of gratifying their desires . But I think I would still try to ask myself the question , What ought we to afford ? I believe that no amount of money would make us change at least one of our policies : limiting the children to one movie a week . ( If something especially good comes to town when the children have already seen their quota , my husband and I declare an extra movie dividend ; but the children know this is pure gravy and not something they can expect as a " right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would follow this policy . I have nothing against the movies . I enjoy them . But I believe parents should do all they can to encourage children to develop their own resources in the matter of entertainment , and I have seen too many adults who go to one movie after another because they can think of nothing better to do with their time . PERHAPS my own ideas would run more to extravagance if it were n't for the steady thinking of my husband . He was one of twelve children . His father was a farmer , and all twelve of the children went through college . The memories of his boyhood are not of expensive playthings , nor are they entirely of long days of work on the farm . He remembers the swimming hole , the time off for hunting and fishing , the bicycle he earned by working . He remembers that he learned how to make toys ? not how to break them . And he remembers the example of his father , who made work an honorable thing . My own childhood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rich in memories that have no dollar sign : days of wandering through Carnegie Museum , getting acquainted with the skeletons of dinosaur and diplodocus ; " exploring " Schenley Park ; listening to the inexhaustible fund of songs and stories that my mother always had on hand ; accompanying at the piano while my father played the violin . None of us can afford everything . There is always the matter of choice . When it comes to big things , we sometimes ask ourselves , Will the family value this more than something else we could get with the money ? When we were saving for our new car , even the children could see the sense of that question . I was debating about buying myself a coat , and Nell said , " But , Mother , your old one looks nice , and if you do n't buy a new one now , we 'll have the money , for the car that much sooner ! " Thus do our teachings come home to roost . We have all seen the adult who , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers ; but I think that if we try , we can help our children reach maturity with some realism in their attitude toward spending . At least we can show them what type of things we consider important . It is not enough to say " No , you may not have that because we ca n't afford it , " or even " Yes , you may have that because we can afford it . " ; it seems to me we owe it to our children to let them know why we think we ought to afford certain things and not others . The children may not always understood our reasoning , but at least they come to know what things we value in life during the years when they are learning what to value .
