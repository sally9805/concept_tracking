One summer night in 1928 , first nighters crowded into a Berlin theater to see Die Dreigroschenoper ( The Threepenny Opera ) , composed by a young highbrow named Kurt Weill on a text by a proletarian poet named Bert Brecht . Nobody thought it would last more than a few performances . How could an eight-piece orchestra and a tatterdemalion cast compete with the great music dramas of Wagner and the moderns ? But two years later , Threepenny Opera was still running , and since then it has had thousands of performances , including a handful in the U.S. Last week it was revived in Manhattan 's tiny ( 300-seat ) Theater de Lys , with new English words by Composer-Librettist Marc Blitzstein . <P> The scene is a tawdry section of Dickensian London . The characters are dregs of the town , led by an enterpriser named Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum , who has managed to organize beggary and make it pay , and one Macheath , thief and trollopmonger . ( " Sloppy Sadie was discovered/ With a knife-wound up her thigh/ And Macheath strolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) <P> Faded Waltzes . The plot takes Macheath through a fake marriage with pretty Polly Peachum , two betrayals by one of his earlier loves , and right up to the moment of his execution-when he is saved by a royal pardon . Beaten into the mixture of bawdry and cynicism are a couple of bitter speeches of social protest , written in a heavy Teutonic style that even Blitzstein 's tart translation could not leaven . <P> The 22 musical numbers recall German caf music of the hungry ' 20s . The artfully threadbare orchestration gives them a kind of tawdry elegance , as of faded Viennese waltzes with indecisive endings . Among the best : Pirate Jenny , appealingly rasped by Composer Weill 's widow , Lotte Lenya , * dreaming of an escape from drudgery by joining a pirate crew ; the Ballad of Dependency , in which Comedienne Charlotte Rae derides Macheath 's virility . <P> Still Alive . Threepenny Opera 's pedigree is two centuries old . Its original was The Beggar 's Opera , John Gay 's satire on the Italian operas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smash hit of the 18th century , so popular that it forced London 's chief composer of Italian opera , George Frederick Handel , to shutter his own fashionable opera house and ultimately turn to writing oratorios . The Weill version took little but the characters from John Gay , was itself a satire on grandiose German operas . It so inflamed musical conservatives in Berlin that students rioted and stoned the theater where it was playing . <P> Manhattan 's new version is neither a smash hit nor a matter for riot . It sometimes bogs down in prosy prose and amateurish acting . But the enthusiasm of audiences for Weill 's score shows there 's life in the old beggar yet . <P> <P> * Who created the role of Jenny a quarter century ago .
