He was just a ten-year-old in Penns Grove , N.J. when he set his mind on becoming Tarzan-or a movieland version of him . Hanging ropes from the tallest trees around , he spent hours swinging from tree to tree . As he grew up , he even began to look the part-tall , dark and handsome , with awesomely muscled arms and shoulders . At Villanova University , Don Bragg neglected rope swinging for pole vaulting , flew so high , despite his hefty 200 Ibs .. that two months ago he set the world 's indoor record of 15 ft. 9 in . But Bragg remained a disquieted young man . He still wanted to play Tarzan in the movies , still used the nickname Tarzan . still had the canvas cases on his poles marked Don " Tarzan " Bragg . <P> Borrowed by the A.A.U. from the Army , Private Bragg . 23 , visited France last month as an athletic ambassador . Excitable French newsmen were dazzled , saw in him the epitome of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' jungle boy . " Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Paris public . " gasped the Paris France-Soir . " If gentle Jane had kneeled beside him . and Cheetah had jumped to his side , " thrilled the Paris-Presse , " nobody would have been surprised . " <P> Finding himself in Ghana last week , on an athletes ' tour sponsored by the U.S. State Department , Bragg seized his chance . On the first break in his closely packed schedule , he took off on a 100-mile trip into the tropical jungle . There he came face to face with a towering , vine-festooned tree . " Is n't this fabulous , Daddy ! " he cried , and heaved himself aloft up a 60-ft. vine . Wearing a varihued. skirtlike Tahitian pareu that he fancies , Bragg spent a happy hour emitting Tarzan yells and swinging from branch to branch . " This is why I came to Africa , " cried Bragg . " I could go on for days . " <P> Down to earth , Bragg was even more certain than ever that some day Hollywood would ask him to be Tarzan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone in the world .
