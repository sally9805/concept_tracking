The superintendent of schools in a New England industrial town not long ago began to worry about the small number of his students who continued on to college . The superintendent asked one of his brightest students why he was going to work instead . Said the boy , with startling directness : " You went on to college , and look what happened to you ! I 'm going into a factory and really make some money . " <P> To Harvard President James Bryant Conant , who told the story last week , the boy 's philosophy is a justified kick in the pants for most U.S. educators . They have been so busy tailoring curriculums for the average and the least able that they have " largely neglected " the most able , i.e. , the top 10% intellectually . One significant reflection of the neglect : fully half of the young people in the top 10% never get to college . This week the Educational Policies Commission issued a 100-page report , Education of the Gifted , supervised by Conant , with an analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy , interested and intellectually growing . " The might-have-beens of history are will-o-the-wisps , " said the commission report . " But the might-yet-be 's of the future are challenges to action now . " <P> The main bogies , as the commission sees them : 1 ) overworked teachers or indifferent parents who fail to spot gifted pupils , or if they do , are unable to give them the encouragement they need ; 2 ) lack of necessary funds to help needy ones continue their education ; 3 ) inflexible curriculums which fail to give the most to the gifted , inadequately prepare them for advanced work ; 4 ) the popular " tendency to idealize the average man and to belittle the exceptional man . " <P> Among the report 's recommendations to give the gifted their due : 1 ) more testing to identify ability sooner ; 2 ) more challenging study , especially in languages , mathematics and history ; 3 ) more personal counseling ; 4 ) more scholarships ; 5 ) more " character education . " The commission was not sure just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain of the need , it warned : " Able and educated leaders who lack character are dangerous , for they may use their abilities for selfish or antisocial ends . " <P> A final commission recommendation : a lot more research needs to be done on the whole subject of gifted youth .
