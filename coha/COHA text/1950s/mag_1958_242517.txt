Through three years of shooting , bombing and burning , terrorists have knocked off British servicemen and fellow Cypriots indifferently . But the wives and children of British troops have generally felt free to go shopping or to sun themselves without fear . <P> One afternoon last week Margaret Cut-liffe , 18 , daughter of a sergeant in Britain 's 29th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment , went shopping with her mother and a friend for her first evening dress-to be worn at her first dance . As the three women emerged from a shop on Famagusta 's Hermes Street , the dress triumphantly in hand , Margaret screamed . Two black-trousered youths bore down on them , poured a packet of bullets into the backs of Margaret 's mother and her companion . Mrs. Cutliffe , mother of five ( the youngest 15 months ) , slumped to the sidewalk dead . Her friend , the wife of a sergeant in the same regiment , was seriously injured . <P> Setting out on a house-to-house search for the murderers , British troops rounded up more than 1,000 males between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barbed-wire compound , where they were made to sit beneath a searchlight 's glare , hands clasped on their heads . The British were angry and rough , and admitted it . In the roundup , at least 150 Greek Cypriots were injured , and three persons died . <P> The Archbishop 's Plan . It was a bitter beginning for Britain 's hapless " adventure in partnership , " the plan to freeze the status of Cyprus for seven years , during which the Turkish and Greek governments would be drawn into running the island 's day-to-day affairs in a kind of tridominium . The Greeks were dead set against any plan to get Turkey into the act . As the deadline for the plan 's start approached , <P> Archbishop Makarios , the bearded Greek Orthodox Ethnarch whom the British expelled from Cyprus for encouraging Greek Cypriot violence , came up with an unexpected proposal : he dropped his old demand for enosis ( union of Cyprus with Greece ) , and asked only for independence for the island . <P> The British , heartily suspicious of Makarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " another Makarios trick , " decided to go ahead with " partnership " despite Greek protests . Only Turkey said " Howdy , podner . " Its special representative reported for duty to British Governor Sir Hugh Foot . But to soften passions , the Turks appointed as their adviser to Foot not someone from Ankara-who might have been welcomed at the airport with bombs-but the Turkish consul general in Nicosia , who was already there . Shrugged 55-year-old Burhan Ishin , a husky onetime Turkish national soccer star and longtime diplomat : " After all , I can only die once . " <P> Agonizing Quarrel . Greece sent no representative at all ; Greek Cypriots shuttered their shops in protest , their schoolchildren paraded in the streets shouting <P> " Death to the plan . " From Athens , Makarios dispatched an inflammatory statement : " I call upon the Greek Cypriot people to oppose vigorously the enforcement of the new British plan and to fight it as one man . " The Greek EOKA terrorists who shot down Mrs. Cutliffe had apparently got the message .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
