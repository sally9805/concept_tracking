THE GOLDEN PRINCESS , by Alexander Baron ( 378 pp. ; Ives Washburn ; $3.95 ) , is a novel of high adventure telling how Hernando Corts conquered Mexico with the aid of his Indian mistress . Skeptics to the contrary , English Author Baron is dealing no joker from the historical deck ; it really happened that way . Malinali , or Marina , as the Spaniards christened her , emerges as a tawny tidbit just turned 18 and just about Corts ' first Mexican conquest . Intelligent and fearless , she soon comes to share his council as well as his bed . On the long , fierce road to the golden halls of Montezuma , Corts relies on her as his eyes , ears and translating tongue . Faithful Marina also bears Corts a son . Yet Novelist Baron never allows her to blot out the challenging figure of the great conquistador . His Corts is a hypnotic leader who can inspire lukewarm , greedy fighters to swashbuckle down to their job . Exploring the inner man as well , Author Baron describes Corts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God becoming the Devil 's disciple , slaughtering some 250,000 Aztecs in the famed siege of Tenochtitlan . Remembered for a superior World War II novel ( From the City , from the Plough ) , Novelist Baron has switched easily from Sten guns to harquebuses , splashes his pages with just the right mixture of bravery and bravura . But beyond that , he captures what few historical novelists even pursue-the moment of impact between two cultures , Western man of the high Renaissance forcing his Faustian will on the passive , hieratic Aztec civilization as it muses in " a trance of centuries . " <P> HOMECOMING , by Jiro Osaragi ( 303 pp. ; Knopf ; $3.75 ) . Billed as a major achievement of Japan 's postwar literature , the novel at its best is an unblinking account of the high cost of survival in a defeated country . At its worst , Homecoming plays the old tearjerking Enoch Arden plot to the accompaniment of samisens instead of violins . Kyogo Moriya is a fiftyish Japanese ex-naval officer who sits out the first part of World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal . There a svelte adventuress two-times him into jail . Back in Japan after war 's end , he sedulously avoids his wife , who has remarried in the meantime , and his grown-up daughter . He gets caught up with a whole series of characters who are more representative than real : a serious painter who stays alive by strumming a guitar in a sleazy cabaret , an ex-admiral who checks shipments at a soap factory , a black-marketeering student with a nose for yen and a yen for such un-Japanese customs as holding hands and kissing . Like identical beads , these characters are threaded on the same theme another Japanese novelist , Kikou Yamata , recently used in her spare and superior novel , Lady of Beauty ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . The theme : Japan is n't what it used to be . In traditional Japanese style . Author Osaragi frequently confuses his writing hand with the long arm of coincidence . He arranges no happy ending , but he does fashion a moving confrontation between Kyogo and his daughter and a sex-sizzling finale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
