 | Geoffrey de Havilland , Pioneer of the Air Disaster took the lives of two sons and threatened to ruin his life work . ? but Britain 's master aircraft designer proved himself unconquerable GUARDS AT the huge de Havilland airplane plant near London , birthplace of the Comet jet airliners that streak across the Atlantic every day , have long been accustomed to salute a humble little car as it slips inconspicuously through the main gate each morning , heads into the steel and concrete city that comprises the factory , and makes for the flight line . Out steps a tall , wiry man with a thin , intense face . Behind the mile-long flight line lies the panorama of his career : at one end the little shed where he designed wood-and-wire airplanes 40 years ago ; at the other the vast cantilever caverns that turn out highly polished jet monsters that now  | nudge the speed of sound and span the oceans and continents of the world . The man 's name is Sir Geoffrey de Havilland , and his fame rests rather less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Fontaine than on the fact that flying men regard him as the boldest airplane designer in the world . But it is not professional skill that has endeared this man to all who know him . It is fortitude . In a lifetime of hair-raising pioneering , de Havilland conquered the air in all its storms and furies , only to have it take from him two sons and hasten the death of a beloved wife . Then , because of the disasters which struck his early Comets , it threatened his life work and reputation . Yet today , at 77 , he has re-established his career , and his name stands once again at the summit of aviation ? a rare triumph of the human spirit . De Havilland reached manhood in an age of change , when the first motorbuses were beginning to jerk noisily past horse-drawn trams . He went to engineering school , and the first result was a handmade motorbike , on which he roared off every week end to his home in Hampshire . FRANCIS VIVIAN DRAKE , as a Royal Flying Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational combat plane designed by Geoffrey do Havilland , the DH 2 . Later he served as an instructor to U.S. Army Air Corps pilots in this country . Remaining lure after the war , he became a U. S. citizen and is now a Reader 's Digest roving editor . Mr. Drake has also flown , as a passenger , in de Havilland 's latest creation , the Comet IV . He took a job designing buses , and got married . The pattern of his life looked unremarkable . Then came one of those awakenings that can change a man beyond recognition . The first flights of the Wright brothers and the French aerial pioneers triggered a strange , almost mystical compulsion in the young motor engineer . He became a man possessed . In those days " aeronauts " were rated on a par with performing monkeys . Still , de Havilland was able to persuade his grandfather to advance him /i000 so that he could quit his job and design an aero engine . Then , together with a friend , Frank Hearle , who has remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of wire , wood and linen . Young Mrs. de Havilland stitched the fabric for the wings , conscious that her husband 's life might depend on every seam . When the plane was finished in 1909 , de Havilland took it off , flew 40 yards ? and crashed . Undaunted , he built another , and he and that plane learned to fly together . Sitting unprotected on the wing , cap jammed backward on his head , hi sharp face seeming to cut into th wind , the tyro pilot knew his firs sweet victory over his lifelong frien and enemy , the air . It coincided wit the birth of his first son , Geoffrey destined to become one of the mos famous test pilots in England . The heady excitement continue until the L moo ran out ; then he an Hearle set to work to produce som of Britain 's first military planes . The  | DH 2 , a primitive pusher machine with no windscreen , no brakes , a switch but no throttle , flew all over c Western Front in World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 miles per hour , fought vius battles , survived the most viol maneuvers without breaking . lc pilots had to be optimists , howet , for the planes were made of , wood , the gas tank was unshielded , incendiary bullets were in use and there were no parachutes . Nevertheless , air power became a reality . De Havilland 's later models , the DH 4 and DH 9 , were the work horses of c war ; 33 percent of all Allied air strength and 95 percent of America 's it ire wartime production were airraft of de Havilland design . The war over , de Havilland saw hat aviation would never become cspectable until more people ' . ) rued to fly . He designed and Hilt a light two-seater named the loth , a simple , rugged Model T of Ilse skies . It was a masterpiece . De I lavilland test-flew it ? as he did all the company 's planes until 1937 ? and there seemed to be nothing it would not do , and at 20 miles to the gallon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , with his wife as passenger . He ailed another and deliberately mashed into the ground ? without Freaking it . A Moth flew the Atantic in 221/2 hours . Now flying clubs sprang up everywhere , and thousands of men learned to fly -a fact that was to help win the battle of Britain in World War II , when pilots were needed in a hurry . When that war started , Britain 's commercial aviation died the same day . Before long , invasion barges filled enemy ports ; London was in flames ; submarines cut supplies . Englishmen had their backs to the wall . But de Havilland looked past the threat of invasion , and set to work to design the tools of victory . He whipped out an extraordinary twin-engined fighter-bomber , the Mosquito . The hard-pressed government could give him no steel , so he again built his planes of wood . The Mosquito became the sensation of the Royal Air Force . When de Havilland 's son Geoffrey , test pilot for the company , flew it , he hit 420 m.p.h . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? so fast that it even overtook the V-1 flying missiles . In a nightmare 6o days it shot down 600 of them . Of the planes that saved England , 23,000 carried the DH symbol on their tails . De Havilland was knighted , and his name evoked respect and gratitude from his countrymen . Then , at this high point , the treacherous air hit back . His son John , also a company test pilot , was killed in a Mosquito collision in 1943 . Thousands were dying for their country , but Sir Geoffrey could not forget that John died in a DH plane , flying under DH orders . And vet another disaster was in the making . During the war a British engineer named Frank Whittle invented the jet engine , and de Havilland built p 128 @# the first production-type model . He produced a jet plane named Vampire , the first to exceed 500 m.p.h . Then he built the experimental DH 108 , and released it to young Geoffrey for test . In the first cautious trials the new plane behaved beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew closer to an invisible wall in the sky then unknown to anyone , later named the sound barrier , which can destroy a plane not designed to pierce it . One evening he hit the speed of sound , and the plane disintegrated . Young Geoffrey 's body was not found for ten days . De Havilland was unable to go near the plant for two weeks . Lady de Havilland , already in poor health , was so hard hit that she died three years later . There was one son left , not a test pilot , and he and his father took up their lives again with a dreadful sense of having paid too much to the air . At the time of Geoffrey 's death , Britain had for five years been forced to concentrate on military planes . De Havilland realized that if he was to resurrect British commercial aviation , it was hopeless to try to catch up with American propeller planes in design . Instead , he resolved to overleap the entire field and build the world 's first jet-liner . Ahead lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stresses would pound the big hulls at high speed and altitude . There was only the half-understood lesson of young Geoffrey 's death . But such was de Havilland 's reputation that British Overseas Airways Corp . and its affiliates ordered 14 of his new " Comets " from the blueprints . The factory worked day and night shifts , and in July 1949 the prototype was test-flown . It was a strikingly beautiful thing . For near ly three years de Havilland crew ; " wrung out " the plane with every test that men could devise . Finally in 1952 , production models were re leased to BOAC for passenger sery ice . At once the globe seemed to shrink in Britain 's hand . Comet roared about the world on sched ules that people found hard to be lieve , while passengers sat in quiet pressurized cabins balancing coin on edge . The Comet became th pride of England . Orders streamer in , and even American operator made pilgrimages to the de Haviland factory . Britain had come lion behind to surpass all competitor ; De Havilland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate to be raises to the heights only to be dashed t the ground . On January 1o , 1954 , a Comet too off from Rome with 35 person aboard .

" You know and I know the cause of this accident , " he said . " It is due to the adventurous , pioneering spirit of our race .

After two months and some 6o modifications , the planes were restored to service . But not for long .. On April 8 Sir Miles Thomas , chairman of BOAC , was aroused in the middle of the night by a dreadful . Another Comet had en off from Rome , reached 28,000 feet and exploded . Sir Miles rushed the BOAC operations center and suspended all Comet operations . The bright dream of world leadership in the air had faded in a night . was a national disaster . At this point de Havilland had million dollars of Comet I ' ' s back on his hands , likely never to fly again , and 30 million dollars of Comet II 's nearly finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him minor compared with the torture of not knowing why his planes had exploded . The crashes were not only tragic but humiliating beyond words ; there was no pilot error , not even sabotage , no weather to arse . His planes had suffered the unforgivable fate of breaking in the air . Now began an exhaustive postmortem . Three Comets were selected for the test . One of them took the air every day , manned by the bravest of the brave , who strove to break it in flight . They were accompanied by a jet bomber to report how they died , if an accident happened . A second Comet was reached to pieces , inch by inch , in the factory . To find out if pressure inside the cabin had burst the structure , a third was immersed in a specially built tank where it was pulsated with high-pressure water day and night , to simulate a 3o-minute climb to 40,000 feet , a two-hour flight and a descent to earth ? with giant hydraulic rams battering the wings to simulate stormy air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , at the end of June , without a second 's warning , the water-tank Comet split . The equivalent of 9000 hours of flight had fatigued the metal around the forward windows ; had the plane been high in the air it would have burst like a bomb ! It was as though , at a place of stress , and at a precise second of fatigue which no microscope could foretell , every atom of the metal had released its hold on the next atom , and the cabin disintegrated . In simple language , the Comet had not been built strong enough . This crowning blow hit de Havilland in his 72nd year . Thousands of crank letters called him a murderer . Sir Miles Thomas was pressured to have BOAC abandon Comets . But these Englishmen were tough men , part of a breed that had died on the snow at the South Pole , on the slopes of Everest , on every wild frontier in their Empire , rather than give up . They knew that they had gained priceless knowledge for the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tara , a man of 70 who held pilot license Number 1 in England , spoke up in words that  | rang throughout the land . " You know and I know the cause of this accident , " he said . " It is due to the adventurous , pioneering spirit of our race . It has been like that in the past . . . and I hope it will be in the future ! " De Havilland , his thin body vibrating with an energy that made his hearers unconscious of his age , presented the executives of BOAC with the specifications of a new plane , to be called Comet IV , containing almost double the seats and double the power of the old ones , embodying all the lessons so dearly bought .
