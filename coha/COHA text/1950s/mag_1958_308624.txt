An organization called the National Rivers and Harbors Congress , composed of state and city officials , port authority members , engineering company executives , etc. , is to the pork barrel what Boston is to baked beans . Last week doughty Budget Director Maurice H. Stans. who does n't care beans about pork-barrel politics , went before an N.R.H.C. conference in Washington to explain why there just is n't enough money for all the rivers and harbors projects that the organization urges on Congress . In fiscal 1959. said Stans , the Federal Government faces a deficit of $8 to $10 billion . True enough . President Eisenhower sent to Congress last January a 1959 budget showing a $500 million surplus , but since then the 1959 revenue estimate has slid from $74.4 billion to $70 billion . Meanwhile , the spending has soared at least $4 billion above the original budget total of $73.9 billion . <P> The looming 1959 deficit , said Stans , compels the Administration to " look critically at each one of the additional expenditure proposals being urged upon us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel the Administration to ask for another boost in the federal debt ceiling , which Congress reluctantly upped from $275 billion to $280 billion only three months ago .
