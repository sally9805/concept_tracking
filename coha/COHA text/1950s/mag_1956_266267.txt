The American Medical Association looked in the mirror of a public-opinion poll to see what the U.S. thinks of its doctors . To nobody 's surprise , the A.M.A. concluded that doctors stand comfortingly high in public esteem . <P> Only 82% of the 3,000 people polled have a regular family physician , but of those who do , 96% think well of him . Commonest criticisms : he thinks he is always right ( 23% ) , he is hard to reach for emergency calls ( 19% ) , he keeps patients waiting longer than necessary ( 15% ) , and he is not frank enough about their illnesses ( 15% ) . <P> When it comes to physicians other than the regular family doctor , the U.S. public is not so charitable : 60% believe that other people 's doctors do not give patients enough time , 46% that they are not frank enough , 43% that they charge too much , 39% that they have too little personal interest in patients . The A.M.A. salves itself with the soothing notion that these harsher judgments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public proved uncannily accurate in estimating the length of the average doctor 's work week ( 64 hours ) and how long he works for nothing ( eight hours ) . The A.M.A. 's pride suffered a rude blow in one respect : only 48% of those polled had ever heard of the outfit , and only one-fifth of these could remember anything ( good or bad ) about it .
