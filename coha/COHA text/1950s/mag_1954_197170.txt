Jawaharlal Nehru , disciple of the nonviolent Gandhi , likes to scold everybody else ( especially the Western nations ) for their bellicose natures . Last week some of the stones he has been throwing were thrown back at Nehru 's glass house . <P> Since India gained freedom in 1947 , Nehru has repeatedly demanded an end to all colonial enclaves in the subcontinent . When his huffing , puffing and pleading did not blow the colonial walls down , armed Indian nationalists ( often Communist-led ) began to stir up revolts in the enclaves , and Nehru gave their activity the kind of silence that implies approval . France let three of its tiny colonies go ( Chandernagor , Mahe and Yanaon ) , and last week the French Foreign Office let it be known that the last two , Pondicherry and Karikal , would be ceded to India within " the next few weeks . " These small faraway colonies were no longer of strategic , economic or sentimental importance to France ( TIME , April 12 ) . <P> Portugal , however , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west coast . Goa , chief among them , is the symbol of a golden age of Portuguese conquest four centuries ago and important to Catholic Portuguese as the final resting place of St. Francis Xavier . Goa is also economi cally profitable : last year the port exported more than $11 million worth of manganese and iron ore . In Lisbon , Nehru 's designs on Goa were greeted by obstinate fury . Lisbon 's Diario de Noticias angrily denounced Nehru as a misguided forerunner of Communism . " The spectacular show staged by Indian imperialism ... is nothing but an episode ... of the subjugation of Asia to the sinister disintegrating forces of Russia , " it went on . " Portugal will not let this sordid spoliation , which also affects the whole Christian West , be accomplished without denouncing it to the world by raising its voice and shedding its blood . " <P> India 's nationalists served notice of a " peaceful " march on Goa in observance of India 's Independence Day ( Aug. 15 ) . Portugal 's scholarly strongman , President Salazar. countered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rome of the East . " <P> <P> At week 's end , Nehru , so free with advice to others , got some advice for himself . In one form or another , nine nations expressed concern to India ( among them the ex-colony of Brazil , supporting Mother Portugal ) . Typical was Britain 's Foreign OSce 's " earnest hope that there will be no resort to force or to methods bound to lead to the use of force . "
