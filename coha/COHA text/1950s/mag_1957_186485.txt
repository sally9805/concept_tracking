Art galleries are normally at their best when they are flooded with light , but last week a black-walled gallery on Paris ' Right Bank was at its best flooded in darkness . Its dazzling show was a Picasso retrospective of 50 characteristic works from 1898 to 1955 , plus another 50 works by such masters as Cezanne , Bonnard , Braque , <P> Gauguin , Dufy , Vlaminck . Their masterpieces split the gloom of the gallery with a luminosity that never glowed from any canvas that had been brushed with paint . They were not paintings , but transcriptions of paintings done in a new technique - and there were signs that they might be here to stay . <P> Gemmaux . They are called gemmaux , a word coined from gemmes ( jewels ) and maux ( enamels ) , and consist of bits of colored glass held together by colorless enamel . A gemmiste works from a painting , transcribing it onto a horizontal plate of glass ( lighted from below ) by juxtaposing and superimposing pieces of glass which have an incredible variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of color can be obtained by superimposing colors in proper combinations . <P> During composition , the fragments of glass are held together by a transparent glue . When the panel is finished , it gets a coat of liquid , transparent enamel , and is baked and hardened in an oven . With sunlight or artificial light behind it , the panel is incandescent . The process , first developed by Jean Crotti. a Parisian. 30 years ago , was perfected six years ago by Roland Malherbe , another Parisian , and was launched by his father , Roger , on a major scale this month . <P> It boasts an impressive list of enthusiastic supporters led by Painters Pablo Picasso , Georges Rouault , Georges Braque and the late Henri Matisse . Picasso and Matisse were so enchanted by the process that they hastened to do a few themselves . " Magnifique ! " cried Braque . " If I were <P> 30 years younger , I would be a gemmiste myself . " <P> Price : $7,000-$ 10,000 . Depending on the tone subtleties to be achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a panel . The price : $7,000 to $10,000 , and the market is brisk . In the first two days of the current show , collectors snapped up <P> 31 panels . Among the buyers : Monaco 's Prince Rainier . Stanley Marcus of Dallas ' Neiman-Marcus ( which will put 15 gemmaux on display ) , and U.S. Designer Raymond Loewy , who says he will open a gemmaux gallery in Manhattan . Gemmaux have also gone commercial . One of the more lurid experiences in the Paris subway these days is the spectacle of Van Gogh 's Bridge at Aries touting the virtues of a washing machine , and his Night Caf exhorting people to drink Perrier water . <P> The possibilities of gemmaux for decoration are considerable . But glass has too brassy a tone to catch certain delicate color harmonies more suitable to paint on canvas . Aware of the medium 's possibilities and limitations , Picasso is already working on several designs specifically intended as gemmaux . If other artists of quality follow his lead and create originals for gemmaux , the medium may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new art .
