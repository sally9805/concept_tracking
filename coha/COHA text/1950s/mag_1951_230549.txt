For the first time since Hitler , opera fans are trooping once again into the big red brick Festspielhaus in Bayreuth , the Bavarian shrine Richard Wagner built to honor his own music . <P> For many , the 7 5-year-old festival is like old times : the same uncomfortable wicker seats , the same kind of program , as heavy and nourishing as Sauerbraten . The opener this week was Beethoven 's hour-long choral Symphony No. 9 , * be followed by Parsifal , Die Meistersinger and the four operas of the Ring cycle . <P> But in contrast to the days when Hitler , Gring , Goebbels , Ribbentrop and Himmler were among the festival bigwigs , this year 's list of honored guests is heavy with Americans , Britons and Frenchmen . Among them : Allied High Commissioners John J. McCloy , Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick , Andr Franois-Poncet . All festival tickets were gone a month ago ( best seats : $11.90 a performance ) . <P> To revive Bayreuth , Wagner 's grandsons Wolfgang , 32 , and Wieland , 34 , collected about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotees . They cleaned up the Festspielhaus , hired musicians , replaced costumes and sets destroyed by playfully masquerading American G.I.s quartered in the building at the end of the war . The Wagners also designed some imaginative props . Example : Fafner , the dragon in Siegfried , is a 30-foot , steam-snorting monster with bloody ten-foot jaws , and teeth a foot long . Mused Wolfgang : " Grandfather , in the sky , probably would not like what we are doing . But on second thought , he was such a revolutionary himself , he would probably go along . " <P> In honor of grandfather , the grandsons engaged Veteran Bayreuth Conductor Wilhelm Furtwngler to lead the soaring Beethoven choral symphony on opening night . The critics found the performance ragged and erratic-as if an orchestra fed on Wagner during six weeks of rehearsals could hardly keep its mind on Beethoven . Even so , the glossy first-night crowd gave the performance an ovation . <P> From now on , for the remainder of the three-week season , Bayreuth will be pure Wagner , with a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wagner conductors , Hans Knappertsbusch and Herbert von Karajan , has ever held the festival podium before . Among the new singers : Met Soprano Astrid Varnay ( Brnhilde ) and U.S. Bass-Baritone George London ( Amfortas in Parsifal ) , who has been a postwar star of the Vienna State Opera ( TIME , Jan. 9 , 1950 ) . <P> <P> * Which Wagner himself conducted at the laying of the cornerstone for the Festspielhaus in 1872.
