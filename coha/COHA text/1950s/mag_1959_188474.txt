" I realized , " said Richard Strauss of the Meisterwerk of his middle age , " that the opera would never have much success . " He was speaking of Die Frau ohne Schatten ( The Woman Without a Shadow ) , the huge complex of mythology and symbolism that he constructed with Librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal during World War I. Strauss guessed correctly : since its premiere in Vienna in 1919 , the work has rarely been staged in Europe and never in the U.S. Last week Die Frau finally appeared on a U.S. stage in a San Francisco Opera production that made cheering audiences wonder where she had been for the last 40 years . <P> Poet von Hofmannsthal 's libretto , embroidered with the common myths of half a dozen cultures , concerns a beautiful empress who is unable to cast a shadow and hence to bear children . In search of a shadow , she persuades a dyer 's wife to surrender her own , and thus renounce her power to bear children , for luxuries and an imaginary romance . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selfless love , the dyer 's wife eventually realizes that she loves her husband , and the empress sees that she herself can not buy love in exchange for another 's misery . Moving between the human and the spirit world , the opera blazes with magic effects : a sword swinging from nowhere , fish conjured from the air into a frying pan , a chorus of " unborn children . " <P> To bring Strauss 's vision to the theater , opera designers decked the cast in blazing costumes , filled the stage with striking Daliesque sets . Standouts of a superb cast were California-born Mezzo-Soprano Irene Dalis as a malevolent nurse and German Soprano Marianne Schech as the dyer 's wife . Conductor Leopold Ludwig whipped his orchestra through the complex , luxuriant score with a fine sense of surging lyricism , a deft feel for the opera 's shadow-flittery moods . " No matter what may happen to the Giants , " glowed the Chronicle 's Alfred Frankenstein , " San Francisco won the pennant Friday night . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
