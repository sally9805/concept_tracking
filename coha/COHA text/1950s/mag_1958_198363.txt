" I found myself daydreaming about whether I would rather have been an American or an English writer , " writes English Author C.P. ( for Charles Percy ) Snow in the New Statesman , and uses his daydream to compare the literary climate of the two nations . Trained as a physicist , now a civil service commissioner , Sir Charles is not only one of England 's best novelists ( The Conscience of the Rich ) , but a topnotch literary critic to boot . He can feel just as comfortable enmeshed in American letters as in those of his own country , and is often invited by U.S. universities for a lecture stint . <P> " The choice existed for Henry James , T.S . Eliot and Auden , " he writes , and it still exists today , but the ultimate criterion for a permanent ocean hop is neither political nor financial . " If the U.S. were really sitting pretty , as unchallengeably at the peak of its power as England was , say , in 1830 , with 50 invulnerable years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers . But I do not see their position in those terms at all ; I believe that essentially we are in the same boat . " <P> What then makes the comparison meaningful , if the odds are so even ? " There is one last general argument , " he goes on , and " if I were choosing , it would be decisive ... It is simply that here we know our audience . In America the writers do n't really know whom they are writing for-apart from their fellow writer-scholars . " In England , " Mr. Macmillan , Mr. Butler , Mr. Gaitskell are all deeply read men , interested in contemporary work ; so are a good sprinkling of other members of the House . That would also be true of a surprisingly high proportion of civil servants and miscellaneous administrative bosses ... Do American politicians , civil servants , schoolteachers read as ours do ? If they do , the writers do not feel their response . That , I think , is the one great creative stimulus we have , which is denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
