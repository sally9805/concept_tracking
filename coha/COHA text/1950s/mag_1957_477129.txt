sINCE this magazine is dedicated to Uplift and Spiritual Values , we are always delighted when we find a story which will help our readers to live cleaner , better lives , and to avoid sheriffs and subpoena servers . Here are three such tales . They arc told by gentlemen who have practically nothing in common except their notoriously upright characters : one is a lawyer , one a fisherman , and the third a- cattleman . Unlike most of the stories you read these days , each of these has a guaranteed , 18-carat moral . One of them , moreover , offers some highly practical , never-before-published information on every woman 's basic problem : How to catch a husband . I. The Case of the Pretty Widow as told by Morris L. Ernst I LOOKED forward to my appointment with Louise , although I could n't imagine what she wanted to see me about . I had met her once before , about two years earlier , when she had asked me to straighten out her husband 's estate . I had liked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even in the first shock of widowhood she had carried herself with courage and confidence . No self-pity . Under less tragic circumstances , she would ? I guessed ? have been a gay and charming woman , perhaps little reckless . I had wondered then what she would make of the rest of her life . When she came into my office this time , she was radiant . She told me that she was about to get married again , and wanted me to draft a new will for her . It was a simple legal chore . She had inherited a substantial amount of property from her first husband , and she wanted most of it to go to her children ? both of them now married themselves . Clifford , the man she was about to marry , earned a comfortable income . To him she wanted to bequeath a couple of paintings he particularly liked ? a Dufy and a Mallet , as I remember it . She told me a little about him . A Wonderful man , head of his own architectural firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sure it would be a happy marriage , and she felt very lucky .. . Then she hesitated for a few seconds . " There is just one thing , " she said . " It worries me a little , and I would be grateful for your advice . It is part of your professional duty , is n't it , to listen and he discreet ? " I assured her that every lawyer was a walking safe deposit box , and urged her to talk as freely as she liked . " Well , " she said , " I suppose you knew ? you must have guessed ? that I always hoped to get married again . Thirty years or more of loneliness was something I could n't bear to think about ? and I knew it would be a mistake to move in with my r children . It nearly always is . ' But it is n't easy for a middle-aged widow to find a marrying-type man , even if she is presentable and has a little motley . The mathematics are against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . The confirmed bachelors are hopeless . They are ready enough for a casual romance , but at the first hint of matrimony they 're off like scared wolves . So what is a girl like me to do ? " I tried the usual things . I went to church . I joined a couple of Worthy Cause organizations where I would ? I hoped ? meet a lot of people . I even took a winter cruise to the Caribbean . No luck . The ship was filled with elderly coupies and a lot of single women as lonely as I Ir was . Louise had not yet edged even close to the scene of her crime , whatever it was , so I tried to help her get to the point , " Do n't tell me , " I said , that you found Clifford through that helpful page of personal ads in the Saturday Review ? " " Worse than that , " she replied . One day I read in the Herald Tribune that a friend of mine had died . I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . Certainly I did n't understand at the time what prompted use to sit down and write him a letter of condolence . Now I know . My unconscious was working overtime for me . " About a week later I got a note from him , thanking me and asking me to lunch . He turned out to be a dull fish , and I never saw him again . But he did give me an idea . " I started writing to men whose wives ' names showed up in the obituary columns . At first I only wrote to people whose families I knew something about . I told myself it was a kindly thing to do , and Heaven knows I had plenty of time on my hands . But pretty soon I branched out . I wrote to every such man who seemed likely to be of a suitable age , and whose address indicated a certain station in life . Preferably an address on the east side of Manhattan , between Forty-seventh and Seventy-fifth Streets . " I never lied to them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just offered my condolences . If they jumped to conclusions , was that my fault ? " Nearly every man acknowledged my letter . Eleven of them invited me to lunch or tea . They were lonely , poor things , and needed somebody to talk to . The last of them was Clifford . He answered my sixty-third note . " Louise explained that they had got on well from the start . They met for tea at the Plaza . A few days later he called to suggest a theater . After that came concerts , a Sunday expedition to The Cloisters , a dinner with a small group of friends at his apartment . In time she took over , by tacit agreement , the role of hostess when he entertained . There had been no sudden gush of emotion ? after all , they were n't youngsters ? but their relationship had developed with a comfortable certainty . Now they were both quite sure they would be happy together . I interrupted again . Had she told him about the letters ? " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you about . I suppose I did trick Clifford , in a way . A perfectly innocent way , I feel , but still it bothers Tue . If a marriage should be based on complete frankness and mutual understanding , perhaps he ought to know about it ? " That notion , I told her , was utter nonsense . A sound marriage is not based on complete frankness ; it is based on a sensible reticence . Moreover , all mating-rituals involve a certain amount of trickery ? that is why makers of peifume and lipstick and girdles have flourished since the dawn of time . My considered advice was for her to stop fretting , keep her mouth shut , and live happily ever after . Apparently she did . I have n't seen her since , but I did meet her husband only a few days ago . He dropped into my office to discuss a minor business matter which his own lawyer could have handled equally well . It occurred to me that something else might be on his mind ? and , sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise . Marvelous woman . . ideal marriage ... how fortunate that they bad come together when they did .. ? " But you have known her longer than I have , " he added , " and I suppose that you think of her with professional detachment . So I thought you might give me some guidance on one small point . " You know how we happened to meet ? Well , at first I was under the impression that Louise and my first wife had been old friends . On our third evening together , however , she dropped an inadvertent remark which made me realize this was not the case . " I did n't mind . In fact , I was rather amused . I have never mentioned the matter to Louise , though ? and recently I have been wondering whether it is right for me to keep it from her . Tell me , now , do n't you think I ought to be completely frank with her ? " II . Here 's to Crime as told by Ed Zern I MET a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he seemed upset . " I most certainly am , " he said . " You 're a fisherman , are n't you ? " I admitted I was , and he said he had just read a statement by an important politician that juverile delinquency was virtually unknown among children whose hobby was fishing . The politician had been speaking at the dedication of a new trout hatchery , and- had urged that all children be brought up as anglers . " It 's outrageous , " my neighbor said . " What 's outrageous ? " I asked . " Encouraging kids to fish , " he said . " jeopardizing a major industry . " His face was purple with indignation . " What major industry ? " I said . - Why , crime , of course ! It 's just about as major as an industry can get ! " " How do you figure that ? " I asked . " How can you figure it any other way ? " he said . " Do you know how many policemen there are in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrates ? prison guards ? stool pigeons ? bailbondsmen. ? hotel dicks ? skip tracers ? wire tappers ? social workers ? lawyers would be out of work if there were n't any criminals ? You 'd be dumping all those hundreds of thousands of people on the labor market . . . and most of them are n't competent to hold a regular job . " Furthermore , think of all the people who now make a pretty fair living being burglars , yeggs , dope peddlers , bank robbers , con men , Iorgers , embezzlers , pickpockets , hijackers , and fences . If they all went straight tomorrow and tried to get honest jobs , they would knock the nation 's employment picture for a loop ? and end up on relief in no time . " " Gosh , " I said , " I had n't thought of that . " " That 's not half of it , " my friend said . " What about the people who build penitentiaries , mann facture handcuffs , night sticks , electric chairs , paddy wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bloodhound leashes ? Every last one of them would be unemployed . So would an army of Hollywood script-writers , television actors , and police reporters . Believe me , buster , if crime ever goes into a decline , you can stand by for another depression ! " " I sure will , " I said , and when I saw a youngster fishing in Kensico Reservoir the following Saturday 18 THE EDITOR 'S EASY CHAIR busted his pole , kicked him in the pants , and sent him home bawling at the top of his lungs and headed , I hope , for reform school and a life of felony . Besides , all the good trout streams are too crowded already . 111 . Here Today and Gone Today , Too as told by Joe L. Williams I T WAS 1892 , when I was foreman of the RO ranch , that Henry Quiller , one of my cowhands , told site how he got rich and learned never to worry about money . Henry came from a big family , and a poor one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father told Henry it was time for him to get moving . " You 'll never have much chance here , " he said . " On this land and with this drought it 's all I can do to feed your mother and the young ones . The best I can do for you is to give you part of the sheep herd ; they 'll starve anyway if we keep them here . I 've heard there is plenty of fresh grass up north , where the country has n't been settled much yet . So you take two hundred head and line out that way . When you come to a likely piece of land with nobody on it , file your claim . " Henry kissed his mother good-by , tied a sack of beans behind his saddle , and started chaperoning those sheep . He grazed them along easy , a few miles a day . It was early in the year , the weather was n't too hot , and he sort of enjoyed himself until his beans-and-mutton diet began to get monotonous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican family living in a sod shack way off by itself in the middle of the prairie . They were trying to make a go of farming , and first off they had planted a little garden patch with chiles and tomatoes anti such truck , as Mexicans usually do . The sight made Henry 's mouth water . He offered to work a few days , setting fence posts and stringing wire , in return for all the vegetables he could eat . The Monteros were glad to have him ? they needed help and company , too ? and he got along with them fine . When the time came for him to move on , the old man said he wanted to give Henry a present . A couple of years earlier the Mexican kids had found a stray Iamb . They had named him Santa Ana and raised him as a pet . In the beginning he had been mighty cute , but now he had grown into a full-sized ram , and a mean one . He would hide around the corner of the shack until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry or something , and then he would butt her clear across the lot . He butted all the rest , too , whenever he could catch them with their backs turned . Old Man Montero wanted to butcher him , but the kids would n't hear of it . So would Henry please take Santa Ana along with his herd ? Henry would . He had a few rams already ? good gentle ones ? but he thought his ewes might be grateful for some more rambunctious companionship . At his age he thought he could handle anything , and he headed north again without a care in she world . Next evening when he was picking up buffalo chips to make a cook-fire , that rain got him . For a minute Henry thought he had been hit by a locomotive , and he could n't sit his saddle with any comfort for two days . From then on he tried to keep an eye on Santa Ana , but the ram was just as smart and treacherous as his namesake . He got in a couple of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain coolness began to grow up between them . By this time Henry had been traveling for nearly three months , and he had reached a country different from anything he had ever seen . It was flat and empty and the bunch-grass grew almost as high as his saddle girth . He was beginning to look for a spring or year-round creek where he could build a homestead , when he came to a canyon a mile wide and half that deep . It was the Palo Duro , on the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River , but of course Henry did n't know that at the time . All he knew was that he had found a sight like he never dreamed of ? miles and miles of red cliffs , with cedar growing on thi slopes below and a pretty strean winding along the bottom . He sat down in the shade of ; mesquite tree right on the rim rock and tried to figure some way to ge his sheep down into that canyor without breaking their necks , ant his . Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grass wood , shelter from the wind ? to make the prettiest ranch you eve ? saw . ( Later on Colonel Charle Goodnight and John Adair had the same idea , and the Adair family are running their JA brand there to this day . ) The shade and the scenery were mighty comfortable , and pretty soon Henry remembered another present the Monteros had given him ? a bundle of old newspapers . He had stuffed them in his saddlebag and forgotten about them ? Henry never was much of a reader ? but now they Caine to mind he thought he might as well find out what had happened in the world since he left home . At first he could n't find anything in the papers of much interest ? some wars going on in Europe , a big fire in Chicago , a steamboat collision on the Mississippi . Then he found a page of livestock price quotations , and he began to get excited . Cattle and sheep had both been going upfast ? on the Kansas City market . Henry fished out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the paper . He calculated the present value of his herd . Then he figured what the natural increase might be each year , especially if he could shelter his sheep in that deep canyon and keep the coyotes away from the Limbs . Gradually it dawned on him that he was a poor hoy no longer . Already he was well off ? and if the livestock market kept rising for a few more years , he could count himself a wealthy man . He looked at his woolies , grazing peacefully in that tall grass , with a new affection . And then he saw Santa Ana at the edge of the herd , pawing the ground with his head down and getting bunched up for a charge . " Let him come , " Henry said to himself . " A rich man like me does n't have to put up with that damned old outlaw any longer . " He stood there , with his back to the canyon , and held out his newspaper at arm 's length , like a bullfighter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Ana aimed right at it , with a full head of steam . What Henry had n't figured was that the rest of the sheep had got in the habit of following Santa Ana . When the ram lunged past that newspaper and took off over the cliff , the whole herd was strung out behind him , running hell-for-leather . " There was n't much I could do , " Henry said when he told me about it years later , " except to start grabbing with both hands . One minute I was practically a rich man . The next minute I did n't have a thing in the world but nine pounds of wool and seven sheep tails . " Right then I realized that wealth was a snare and an illusion , and from that day on I 've never even tried to make a lot of money . Lknew 1 never could hold on to it if I got it . ' '
