Strange things were happening in London . Fake detectives arrested Englishmen and marched them off to be gazed upon and laughed at . Fake paper hangers entered the homes of Englishmen and gummed up the walls beyond recognition . A fake baby was bundled in the arms of a woman as she singled out a total stranger standing in a bus queue . " He , " she cried , pointing at the stranger , " is the father of my child ! " <P> What had happened to British dignity ? Commercial television had been let loose in the land . <P> The biggest shocker was People Are Funny ( originally a U.S. show ) , ostensibly put on to entertain viewers , but really to sell them soap and such . Parliament and the press have denounced the show so roundly that it will be taken off the air next month . But though commercial TV has lost one battle , it is clearly in Britain to stay . In the five months it has been around , it has shown that in some ways it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBC . <P> Top Ten . BBC has admitted that in the London area commercial TV is drawing about 51% of the potential adult TV audience . For viewers who have a choice , commercial TV also has the top ten most-popular shows : 1 ) Sunday Night at the London Palladium , 2 ) The Gracie Fields Show , 3 ) Saturday Show Time ( variety ) , 4 ) Jack Hylton 's Half Hour ( variety ) , 5 ) Robin Hood , 6 ) Take Your Pick ( quiz ) , 7 ) Roy Rogers , 8 ) International Screen ( movies ) , 9 ) I Love Lucy , 10 ) Dragnet and The Inner Sanctum in a tie with a variety show , a disk-jockey show and a mystery-drama show . In prime evening hours , commercial TV outdraws the BBC in homes with a choice by three to two . <P> Commercial programs can be tuned in only in the London area . Out of 4,000,000 families in that area , about 1,600,000 ( roughly 40% ) have TV sets . Only about 525,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of converting their sets so they can get commercial as well as BBC telecasts . Result : commercial TV has a potential adult audience of only 1,425,000 , compared to BBC 's potential of 12.5 million . <P> British commercial TV has already been forced to discontinue morning programs because it can not find enough advertisers to foot the bill . It has been sharply criticized for abandoning " cultural " programs and trying to win customers with " sheer entertainment . " The Independent Television Authority stoutly retorts that it presents as much and sometimes more news , political discussion , religious programs and classical music than the BBC . <P> Crucial Test . Nonetheless , nobody seems to be very happy about British commercial TV . Critics snipe away . Advertisers are reluctant to buy time . This week commercial TV faces a crucial test when it begins operating a new transmitter in Birmingham , in the populous midlands . It is estimated that by the end of the month 400,000 additional families ( about 1,150,000 viewers ) will be able to see commercial TV shows . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming a TV nation . Britons who have looked down their noses at U.S. TV are learning a few lessons , notably , that 1 ) popular taste in any country , even Great Britain , is apt to be common , 2 ) hucksters making a sales pitch can be repulsive , and 3 ) any relationship between commercial TV and " culture " is likely to be pure coincidence .
