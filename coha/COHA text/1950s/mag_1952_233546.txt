" Thou hast given us abundant resources . . . Our industries are the marvel of the whole world . . . Our standard of living has no comparison in all history . . . These things are the gift which in Thy goodness Thou hast given us . <P> " In this day of world confusion , Thou hast given us leadership in the cause of freedom and right among nations . We seek no empire . We want no world domination . . . We want to serve Thee and use our leadership among the nations for the genuine peace and prosperity of all mankind . Do Thou , O God , lend Thine ears to this , our humble prayer . " <P> - Invocation by Cardinal Stritch at the G.O.P. Convention
