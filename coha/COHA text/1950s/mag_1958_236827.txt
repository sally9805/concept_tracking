After a six-month suspension of the controversial fast tax write-off program , the Office of Defense Mobilization reopened it last week . The program is much smaller than before , applies only to production of new items and research for the armed forces or the Atomic Energy Commission . Virtually eliminated are write-offs for expansion of such defense items as B-52 bombers ; out completely are such onetime participants as railroads , airlines , utilities and the merchant marine . <P> When the program was devised during the Korean war to spur defense construction , companies in almost every industry were permitted to deduct about 60% of expansion costs from taxable income in only five years instead of the usual 20 . Defense facilities totaling $38.2 billion were given the break , and the result was a tremendous boost to the postwar economy as well . But since Korea , hardly anyone has been happy with the way the program has been run . While former Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey decried the loss of tax revenue , which he said totaled $880 million in fiscal 1956 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer giving them relief for peacetime expansion of facilities vital to war . <P> In 1958 a selective boost in tax writeoffs for some depressed industries might be a healthy spur to business . But the program will now shrink to less than $300 million annually , down from $5 billion in peak years . Many of the 329 back applications will be knocked out .
