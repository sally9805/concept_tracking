One of the toughest tasks Dwight Eisenhower has faced as President of the U.S. is the job of capturing control of the Government . After 70 years of ups &; downs , the civil service had spread its patriarchal protection over 95% of all 2,500,000 federal employees . Ike had trouble getting a toe hold on 900 top policymaking jobs in Washington for his own appointees . Last week , however , the Administration won a sizable beachhead in its battle with the burrowed bureaucrats . <P> In a test case , Washington 's U.S. District Judge Richmond Keech , a Democrat , ruled that the Department of Justice had a right to dismiss Attorney Leo A. Roth from his $10,800-a-year job . Roth , who was fired last June , insisted that he had unassailable civil-service status . Judge Keech held that the President has unlimited power to decide which jobs " shall be excluded or excepted from the classified civil service . " <P> The court victory should provide some small comfort for Republican National Chairman Len Hall , who has the unhappy task of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Education and Welfare Secretary Hobby to ask : " Oveta , have you got a social-security program yet that will give a 53-year-old man $500 a week for the rest of his life ? " <P> " No , Len , " said Mrs. Hobby , " but why ? " Replied Hall : " Because if you have , I 'm quitting this blasted job . " Hall and other Republican politicians complain that the Eisenhower Administration ignores their patronage demands . It will probably continue to do so . Ike and his top advisers are much less interested in jobs for Republicans than they are in removing those Democratic bureaucrats who , actively or passively , resist Administration policies . <P> Although the Roth decision affects some 350,000 federal employees , it does not mean 350,000 new jobs for Republicans . " It should not bring alarm to career employees and those in the competitive civil service , " said Civil Service Commissioner George Moore . He had a warning for some workers , however : " I have been told of many examples of how federal employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration . I do not believe . . . the civil-service system should be used as a device for protecting those who seek to destroy the policies and programs of President Eisenhower . "
