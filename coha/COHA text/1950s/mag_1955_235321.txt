Teen-agers on the streets of New Orleans ' Vieux Carr can still remember when their pal Willie Pastrano was a fat little five-foot butterball , the butt of all their jokes . Lately they have stopped laughing . Stretched out to his full growth ( 5 ft. 11 in. , 181 lbs . ) , Willie , at 19 , has toughened into one of the most promising heavyweight fist fighters since laughing Billy Conn came within a couple of rounds of whipping Joe Louis in 1941 . <P> But prizefight promoters still look on Willie as not quite big enough to take care of himself ; he has to get his mother 's consent before every fight . Last week , before he was permitted to tangle with Philadel phia Toughie Joe Rowan in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden , New York boxing commissioners studied his record care fully , reminded themselves that he had beaten such rough customers as Joey Maxim , Paddy Young and Chuck Spieser , and decided to overlook their rule against boys under 20 going ten rounds . <P> There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashy footwork ' and sharp punching of an old pro . He moved too fast ever to get set for a solid blow , but his left jab kept Rowan off bal ance all through the fight . At the end , he barreled in to demonstrate that he can hold his own in a close-in roughhouse and absorb some solid swipes without slowing up . His night 's work earned him a unanimous decision , and gave the matchmakers something new to think about in their search for a heavyweight-title contender .
