( See Cover ) <P> " At last I came under a huge archway and beheld the Grand Lunar exalted on his throne in a blaze of incandescent blue . . . The quintessential brain looked very much like an opaque , featureless bladder with dim , undulating ghosts of convolutions writhing visibly within . . . Tiers of attendants were busy spraying that great brain with a cooling spray , and patting and sustaining it . . . " <P> -H . G. Wells , The First Men in the Moon <P> Last week , in a pastel blue and grey room on the fifth floor of a St. Louis office building , the newest Wellsian brain in the earthly world was enthroned . This quintessential brain looked like nothing more than a collection of filing cases , stretching in a 60-ft. semicircle about the room . From within the grey metal cases came a faint humming sound ; along the light-studded metallic face were scores of twinkling orange sparks , rippling like waves of thought . As in the Grand Lunar 's palace , a blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy pink . Air conditioning filtered out the dust , kept the temperature at an even 75 . Along one end of the chamber was a gleaming plate-glass observation window , through which mere humans-attendants and sightseers - could watch and marvel . <P> The brain was the newest electronic calculator , developed by International Business Machines Corp . and installed in Monsanto Chemical Co. ' s St. Louis headquarters . To IBM , it was the " Model 702 Electronic Data Processing Machine . " To Monsanto and awed visitors , it was simply " the giant brain . " Seated at its control console , a man has at his command the computing ability of 25,000 trained mathematicians . <P> New Horizons . On each of its reels of magnetic tape , the brain can remember enough information to fill a 1,836-page Manhattan telephone book-any figure , word , chemical or mathematical symbol-and work the information at the rate of 7,200 unerringly logical operations per second . In its vast computing units ( 2,500 electronic tubes , three miles of wire ) it can multiply a pair of 127-digit numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . In a second it can add 4,000 five-digit figures or do 160 equally complicated long divisions . And at the end , it can produce its answers in any of four ways-flash them on a TV-like screen , punch them on cards , print them on paper , or store them away on rolls of magnetic tape at the rate of 15,000 characters every second . <P> To Monsanto , the great brain will mean unprecedented speed , accuracy and economy in every phase of its manifold chemical business . In just twelve machine-hours the brain will do 1,200 cost reports that normally take 1,800 man-hours ; in barely two hours it will complete a financial statement that takes a staff of accountants 320 hours . For Monsanto 's chemists it will open up new horizons by rapidly working out complex equations to help discover new products , improve old ones , find out which of dozens of technically " correct " answers ' to problems are the best .                    @
