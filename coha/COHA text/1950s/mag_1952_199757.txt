Alone , friendless and frightened , the old lady would not listen to reason . Only an operation could save her , the doctor had said , but she wanted no operation . Let her die . No , there was no family to call-no one at all , except " the Alliance . " Willing to try anything , the doctor called the Educational Alliance on Jefferson Street in Manhattan 's lower East Side . <P> Alliance Director A. Harold Murray hurried to the hospital . He spoke to the exasperated doctor , then to the bewildered old lady . What , she wanted to know , was this operation ? Murray explained . Well , she said , if Mr. Murray said it was O.K. , it was O.K. The Alliance was all the family she had . The doctor shook his head in wonder . <P> Peddlers &; Patriarchs . East Siders would not have wondered . For nearly 60 years the Alliance has been more than a family to thousands who live south of Union Square between the East River and the Bowery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight-packed tenements , has been a bridge Between European ghettos and the bright promise of American citizenship . <P> Built in 1893 by men who knew the value of that citizenship-Isidor Straus ( R. H. Macy &; Co . ) , Jacob Schiff ( Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. ) , and other leaders of New York 's Jewish community-the Alliance filled a great gap in the lives of immigrants . There a man could come to learn English , use the library or the gymnasium , attend religious services or smoke a pipe with a Landsmann over a game of checkers . There mothers , still wearing sheitels , could learn the language that their children were picking up quickly in public school . And the kids themselves could come after school to work at their hobbies in Alliance playrooms , attend dances and do their homework . <P> Poverty hung heavily over the neighborhood in the Alliance 's early days . Washing flapped in the breeze that blew between firetrap tenements . Men scrabbled for thin wages in the city 's sweatshops . But at the Alliance , anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded classrooms . In 1915 Abbo Ostrowsky , an energetic young artist from Odessa , began the art instruction he continues today . <P> Austrian-born Chaim Gross came to Ostrowsky as a youngster two days out of Ellis Island , fed himself on the fruit the students were to draw as still life , and later developed into a world-famous sculptor . Such artists as William Auer-bach-Levy , Jo Davidson and Jacob Epstein paid 3 a week for instruction , used pushcart peddlers for models , or bearded patriarchs who posed for 15 an hour . <P> Young Eddie Cantor acted in Alliance-sponsored plays , Arthur Murray learned to dance there , and Morris Cohen discussed philosophy in the Comte Synthetic Circle . Radioman David Sarnoff and Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver got encouragement from sympathetic teachers .
