School Superintendent Alexander Jerry Stoddard of Los Angeles is a genial , ruddy-faced man with the patience of Penelope and the optimism of Dr. Pangloss . Last week , as he stepped down as the head of one of the nation 's largest school systems , he could claim a record of sorts . Few U.S. superintendents have sailed through quite so many tempests-or managed to weather them quite so well . <P> <P> A graduate of Nebraska State Teachers College in Peru . Stoddard started teaching to support himself through law school . But after a few months on the job , " I came home and told my wife that teaching was my field , and I 've been in it ever since . " By 1948 , armed with a master 's from Columbia Teachers College and a doctorate from the Rhode Island College of Education , he had held a succession of **28;14184;TOOLONG , Schenectady , Providence . Denver , Philadelphia . But even that was not enough to prepare him fully for his experiences in L.A. <P> Plenty of Trouble . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving the selection of the school system 's telephone operators . In 1950 a grand jury began investigating charges that the operators ' examinations were " rigged " to discriminate against Jews and Negroes . Though this investigation was eventually dropped , the board was soon faced with even graver charges involving its awarding of school contracts . The result : four of its members were either defeated in elections or removed from office . <P> With that storm passed . Stoddard found himself headed into another . This time the cause of the ruckus was a teacher 's manual about UNESCO that Stoddard had hoped to use in the schools . Some citizens , how ever , led by Hearst 's Herald &; Express , had other ideas . UNESCO , the critics charged , tended to subvert nationalism in favor of one world , and this in turn was closely akin to Communist international ism . The local American Legion joined the attack , and the Veterans of Foreign Wars passed a resolution condemning " this planned corruption of the American children 's minds . " Eventually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw the manual . <P> When he decided to accept a $335,000 Ford Foundation grant for a special teacher-training program to alleviate L.A. 's perennial shortage , the Herald &; Express erupted once again . The whole idea , the paper grumbled , seemed to be some sort of plot . Had not the foundation 's former President Paul Hoffman favored UNESCO ? Was Stoddard thus merely using the grant " to swing UNESCO . . . back " into the schools again ? " Pink Socialism . " cried the paper-and Stoddard was forced to drop the grant . <P> Plenty of Hum . In spite of such setbacks . Stoddard maintained his equilibrium . " You know . " says he , " anybody who serves the total public is in the midst of life . The school superintendent does not live in a house by the side of the road ; he 's right smack in the middle of the road , and sometimes he gets bumped . " Though bumped aplenty . Superintendent Stoddard kept his schools humming . He upped the annual budget from $90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue for $130 million . He has put up scores of new school buildings .
