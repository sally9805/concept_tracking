An official call brought the diplomatic representatives of the U.S. , Britain and France hurrying down to the big sprawling Foreign Ministry on Moscow 's Kuznetsky Most one day last week . Deadpan Andrei Gromyko , deputizing for Foreign Minister Vishinsky , handed the allied diplomats identical notes demanding a four-power peace conference on Germany at the earliest possible moment . Like so many diplomatic notes these days , it was designed to ruffle and embarrass the countries it was submitted to . <P> But it had been artfully constructed to attract the onlooking Germans . By Russian proposal , all foreign troops would be withdrawn from Germany , and a united Germany would be recreated . Germany would be left free to develop her own economy , including armaments , free to build up her own air-sea-land defense forces , free to pursue her own political life , with " organizations inimical to democracy " outlawed , but with all former Nazis and Wehrmacht officers ( except those in jail ) enjoying full citizenship . The new Germany would undertake not to enter into any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her former enemies . There were other catches : Germany 's eastern border would be at the rivers Oder and Neisse , from 50 to 100 miles west of Germany 's prewar frontier , thus finally legalizing the Communists ' grab at Potsdam . And nothing was said of the 100,000 German soldiers still imprisoned in Russia . <P> Russia 's proposal fell flat . West Germany 's reaction was to hurry its plans to rearm in concert with the West , in return for the West 's promise of almost complete sovereignty for the Bonn government . Chancellor Konrad Adenauer told allied negotiators that he regarded Moscow 's new offer as leading from weakness instead of strength . <P> Formerly Moscow talked of a united , disarmed Germany ; now for the first time Moscow itself proposed rearmament , not of 50 million West Germans , but of 70 million East and West Germans . Allied negotiators regarded this as a propaganda godsend in France . There Russia 's reversal of its former hostility to German rearmament brought forth cries of " another Hitler-Stalin pact . " Now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French the awful picture of grey-green Wehrmacht armies on the march again . Western diplomats hoped that this would make Frenchmen more willing to accept carefully controlled West German rearmament within NATO 's European Army . <P> But though Westerners think in such fashion , they do not say so in diplomatic replies . This week the allied diplomats got together to respond to the Russian proposals . Their expected reply : Russia has made no mention of how she proposed to form a treaty-worthy " general German government . " If Russia is really in earnest , let her admit a U.N . commission into East Germany to see whether democratic elections are possible there .
