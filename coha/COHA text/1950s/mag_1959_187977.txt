With better luck than anyone had a right to expect , President Eisenhower last week found just the man to take on the job-vacant since the " wanted " sign was hung out last August-of running the Pentagon 's increasingly diverse research , and engineering problems . The man : Dr. Herbert York , 37 , one of the nation 's top scientists , who has been holding down the job of chief scientist of the Defense Department 's Advanced Research Projects Agency , ten-month-old overall Pentagon planning group . <P> Known in the scientific world as a rollicking wit and a hard worker , stocky ( 5 ft. 11 in. , 190 Ibs . ) Physicist Herb York got his start in science as a small boy in Rochester , N.Y. , when his uncle gave him a book on astronomy . He worked his way through the University of Rochester ( A.B . ' 41 , Phi Beta Kappa ) , took his Master 's in 1943 . After that he joined the parade of topnotch atomic physicists at the University of California 's famed Radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved his wife and three children to Washington and took on his ARPA job , turned out to be that rare combination of thoroughgoing professional and easygoing , low-pressure executive . Once a sports-jacket type , York has changed to conventional suits , but his wife still has to sew identifying labels into his clothing , for he is color blind . <P> In his new $22,000-a-year job , Herb York will need all the wit and vision he can muster . By title , he will be Defense Secretary Neil McElroy 's Director of Research and Engineering , will have supervisory control over the $2.5 billion Defense Department scientific projects-but no scientific budget of his own . Enmeshed in the program are all the stubborn duplications , fears and rivalries of different services whose planners and dreamers demand a separate piece of the wild-blue-yonder projects . The Air Force , for example , got miffed at ARPA when ARPA 's Johnny-come-lately Boss Roy Johnson took much of the credit for the successful launching of the orbiting Atlas ( TIME , Dec. 29 ) , which , after all , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the in-fighting between the Pentagon 's ARPA and the civilian-controlled National Aeronautics and Space Administration . ARPA 's Johnson recently stomped on NASA 's big toe by publicly proclaiming the broad details of NASA 's upcoming man-in-space Project Mercury . If anyone can survive the built-in hazards of the job , walk a straight line through the service detours and still know a scientific toe when he sees one , it is Herb York . <P> NASA 's Project Mercury , to be detailed officially in mid-January , aims to shoot a man into orbit within two to three years , and return him safely to earth . Although much of the hardware for the shoot has been developed and proved , scientists are still working on the development of new metallurgy and better tracking and recovery systems . Pushing the capsule-enclosed man into space will be the job of the Air Force 's Atlas ( another 20 or 30 Atlas shoots must be made before the missile can be considered thoroughly reliable ) . Who will be the first orbiting man ? NASA will carefully choose a team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the big day approaches , the first man will be selected from this group ; the others will make subsequent flights .
