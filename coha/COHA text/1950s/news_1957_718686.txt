Computing Realty Returns state Provision Basing Percentage en Sales Price Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THENew York TIMES The low-income , tenement-occupy ! ing people of the Yorkville district of Manhattan have reason to be fearful and resentful of the provision in the rent control law passed by the Legislature permitting landlords to use the sale price of a property as the property value to be used in computing a fair return ( presently fixed by law at 6 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this district within the past . two or three years property values under the impact of the boom in luxury-apartment-house construe : tion have skyrocketed to levels out of all proportion to their actual values . Most of the rises have been due to the speculative activities of real estate operators who have pure chased properties not with a view to occupation , investment or modern .. ization , but simply for the purpose of assembling a plot of suitable size for the construction of a luxury apartment house , then reselling it at an enhanced over-all price to a builder . We must assert moral leadership if we are to be successful politically by vigorously pursuing the campaign here in the United States to achieve equal opportunity for all of our citizens . Now , before it is too late , is the time for us to translate the ideal into action . THEODORE W. KHEEL , President , National Urban League , Inc . New York , April 9 , 1957 . . Trolley Cal . Nostalgia To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your editorial of April 5 " The Last Trolley Car , " when you say " We regret the passing of the trolley car , and we have never been convinced that the bus was a fair or completely beneficial exchange . " My dear sir , I could not be in more hearty agreement . But I should like to go a step further . I am fully convinced that there is no comparison between trolley cars and buses . You have no doubt stood on a corner waiting to cross the avenue ; the rear end of a bus is near you ? the lights change  --  suddenly you are enveloped with the noxious fumes from the exhaust pipe of the bus . Or you are seated in a bus , passengers are trying to make their way through the narrow , crowded aisles ? there is a. sudden stop  --  hands , elbows , bags , pocketbooks , bundles fly at you . The good old trolley ! Let 's take the open kind on a hot and sticky summer day . You would be privileged to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might even have a pleasant word to say . You would cool off in no time , and when you came to your destination you hated to get off . Even inside the closed trolleys in winter the air never became really bad ; no gasoline or Diesel oil odors . I doubt that the buses are faster . Where is there a single advantage ? WARREN JAMES TAUSSIG . New York , April 5 , 1957 . Toward a United Europe To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In the closing paragraph of his eloquent letter published in your issue of April 3 Joachim Stresemann speaks modestly of " men who were ahead of their time " working toward a United Europe . It seems fitting to mention that his own father , the great German statesman Gustav Stresemann , was one of these practical dreamers . Together with the equally prophetic Aristide Briand of France he was about to build a true European community . Had the untimely death of these two men and the subsequent rise of Hitler to power not shattered these hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It . seems surprising that in all the many reports about the accords signed in Rome ? one name is hardly ever mentioned , that of Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi . He is the man . who created the Pan-European movement ? in 1923 and who ever since has carried on the fight for this ideal . He is the man who would deserve to be one day the first President of the United States of Europe . How shall we Americans of 1957 greet this coming new Europe ? The great French poet Victor Hugo gave the answer in a prophetic speech 108 years ago : " The day will Comp , " he said , To Better Race Relations New Nation : of Ghana Points Up OurpObleM:Here , It Is ' Said To THE EDITOR ' OF THE New York TIMES : In his report ; to President Eisenhower on his African trip Vice President ?

It is worth underscering . The ' comment Was made in reference to the birth of the'new ? nation of Ghana . When Ghana 's Prime Minister . Nkrumah delivered his first state of the union message he ? said that he was not seeking any financial aid for his country though he would welcome technical assistande Most important , as I learned from an hour-long conference with Dr. Nkrumah during the independence celebration in Ghana last month , Ghana looks to the United States for moral leadership . Conversely , dependent nations everywhere are intently watching Ghana in its meaningful transition from dependency to full . freedom . Thus the example set by the United States for Ghana will ultimately be felt throughout the ' world . This presents a new dimension to the problem of race relations we must at all costs solve here at home . Negroes in this country and elsewhere correctly look upon Ghana as proof to the world that equal opportunity pays dividends . Ghana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the opportunity . While Ghana has patterned its government and social order on the our claim them and simply holds them for resale to a builder . Under the provision in the law , if signed by Governor Harriman , the owner of these properties will pre : sumably be able to obtain greatly , increased rents on the basis of the $120,000 sales price ? at least rental ; sufficient to yield him 6 per cent plus 2 per cent depreciation on that price . As I see it , therefore , this provision in the law can only have the following effects : Tenants in buildings where speculative activities have already occurred and will ' occur in the future will be required to subsidize those activities in the form of higher rents while their speculator-owners are waiting purchasers for their build. ; ings . Despite the restriction of the prop vision to a single sale in a two-year period  --  admittedly an extremely moderate one at best ? it will undoubtedly stimulate further speculative activity and further unwarranted rises in the values of property in this district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate owners to arrange fictitious sales of their properties ( through corporations , syndicates , friends and relatives ) in order to gain the benefits of the provision . It seems to me that this is an extremely unfortunate provision . MILTON HARRIS . New York , April 4 , 1957 . Commercialized Flower Show To THE EDITOR OF THE New York TIMEs : When I paid $1.75 for admission to the recent Flower Show at the Coliseum I did so with supposition that I should see a flower show . I was very much disappointed . I saw hundreds of other commodities which I could have seen , admission free , at any department store . It is true that there were flowers , but the flowers took back seats . It is preposterous that this great New York City did not give the flower lovers of New York a real show of flower beauty without overshadowing the beauty with side-ring ' circus commercialization . If this commercialization must be displayed , then take down the Flower Show sign and print a catalogue Of the commercial products for sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1957.
