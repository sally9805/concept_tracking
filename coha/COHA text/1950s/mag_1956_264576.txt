A tremendous improvement found by U.S. researchers should eventually take much of the guesswork out of treatment of subborn infectious diseases . <P> Despite the " wonder drugs , " which kill specific kinds of germs , physicians are still handicapped in starting treatment because in many cases they do not know what kind of germ they are fighting . Hence , they do not know which drug to use . If they take a specimen from a patient , e.g. , sputum , spinal fluid , they can grow the bacteria from it and eventually identify them , but this takes about a week . In Atlanta , Bacteriologist Max D. Moody of the U.S. Public Health Service described a method for achieving this result within an hour . <P> First , a drop of the specimen fluid is smeared on a microscope slide . Then it is covered with a drop of serum ( from an animal ) containing the antibody which develops when the suspected species of bacteria is present . This serum is tagged with fluorescein , a luminous substance . If the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow under the microscope . If the tester has guessed wrong , no glow , and he tries again with other antibodies.
