On April 29 Federal District Judge David A. Pine ruled it unconstitutional , but his order to return the mills to private hands was stayed pending appeal to the Supreme court . The high court upheld Pine 's finding in a 6-3 ruling June 2 , government seizure was ended the same day , and the union called the strike .
