For more than two years , the feud between Egypt 's Colonel Nasser and Jordan 's King Hussein fairly curdled the Middle East 's air waves with choice blends of camel drivers ' curses , ancestral aspersions and bogeyman bombast . Heckling Hussein as " the little king " and " a British Zionist agent , " Nasser 's radios warned Hussein and " his gang " that the Jordanians would soon " hang you on poles and watch your rotten bodies swing . " <P> " Nasser fills the earth with plots and corruption , " answered King Hussein in a broadcast . " His voice and his radios rave both morning and night like one stricken with fever . " Hussein 's radio labeled Nasser the " new pharaoh , " " Communism 's first agent in the Middle East . . . pilgrimaging to his Mecca in Moscow time after time , " and Bedouin signs proclaimed , at parades honoring the King : " Hussein is the son of the Prophet , Nasser the son of a postman . " <P> But last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shifting politics of the Middle East can make the best of bedfellows transients , or the worst of enemies useful , in short order . Concern over Iraq had brought them together : Nasser 's fear of an Iraq that challenged his all-Arab pretensions , Hussein 's distaste for the Iraqi regime that came to power by killing his King-cousin . In a move calculated to enhance Nasser 's claim to be the friend of all Arab nations and to bolster Hussein on his precarious throne , the colonel and the King made up , agreed to try to be friends as they once were ( see cut ) , arranged to exchange ambassadors again next month .
