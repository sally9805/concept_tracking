That Texas girl who has been one of the theater 's brightest stars for more than twenty years reveals what her hectic private life is like . Mary Martin looked around her at the glass-enclosed sunroom of her apartment . It was a transparent room . It seemed to hang sus  --  pended sixteen stories high above New York 's East River . Looking down , I could see water glittering below me . It formed acres of shattered diamonds . The wind from that river had clawed its way through my clothes on my way to see her , but in that glass room everything was warm , pleasant , protected . She told me , " Richard ( that was her hus  --  band , Richard Halliday ) and I have had twenty-two homes in our life together . At least I think it 's been twenty-two . Several times I 've tried to count them , but each time I came up with a different number , so I gave up . " " Where was your first home after you mar  --  ried ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to Beverly Hills , " she said . " My mother-in-law helped me with that one . She dropped everything and flew to California because I knew nothing . I still do n't know very much , but in eighteen years I 've learned a few things . " " How 'd you happen to ask her to fly west ? " I asked . " I 'd made five movies in a row for Para-mount , " she went on . " Richard was story editor there . We 'd just been married , and I was very anxious to be a good housewife . This included doing over a house we 'd leased . The trouble was that I had n't the vaguest idea how to go about it . For one thing , I had lived only in my parents ' home , and nat  --  urally my mother had run that . The rest of the time I 'd lived in hotels , so I had n't the foggiest notion how to be a housewife . " She smiled and said , " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife , but the worst part was that Richard himself knew more about how a house should be run than I. " " How did he know ? " I asked . He was raised that way , " she explained . " He 'd lived in a series of apartments with his mother . He 'd inherited excellent taste from her . He 'd picked the rest of it up by osmosis , and all of this made me feel completely in  --  adequate . We had an argument one night about keeping house , I had hysterics and , when he left for the studio the next morning , I called his mother and sobbed , ' If you want our marriage to last , you 'd h - get here quickly . ' " Oh , I forgot , " she said . " I could n't find her in New York . When I called I was told that she was on a river boat floating down the Mississippi , but I kept on trying anyhow . I finally reached her on that river boat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never flown before . " " How old was she ? " I asked . She thought , then said , " She 's eighty-two now , and Richard and I have been married eighteen years . She must have been sixty-four then . She lives in this same apartment house so we can all live under the same roof . She 's fan  --  tastically wonderful . " " You say you located her on a river boat , . I reminded her .

She taught me a great deal , but almost everything else I know I 've learned from Richard . The only thing I knew how to do when I got married was to buy a piano . " Laughter bubbled up in her . " We had a piano be  --  fore we had a bed . " She pointed through huge glass doors at an emperor-size double bed in the next room . " That 's the bed we bought . It has been more trouble to us than anything in the world because every time we 've moved it 's been a problem . This last time we had to hoist it up sixteen floors , using a block and tackle on the outside of the building . " " That must have been something to see , " 1 said . " It was quite a trick , " she admitted , " because it only has one mattress and one frame . We moved it in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it east when we bought a one  --  **29;1567;TOOLONG house in Norwalk , Connecticut . We kept our Nor  --  walk home for fifteen years , and during that time we remodeled the place , so when we moved to this apartment , we had to remove one whole side of the house to get that bed out . When we got to the new apartment , the telephone rang and the superintendent downstairs said , ' Mrs. Halliday , a man has just left your bed in the middle of the street . ' I was rehearsing , Richard was talking in the office with about six people , and I did n't like to tell him anyhow , because this is a very nice apartment house . People like Clare Boothe Luce and Henry Luce , and Garbo , live here , and 1 did n't care to think about how they would feel about a brand-new-neighbor 's bed dumped out in the middle of the street . But finally I broke down and told Richard , and we got another moving company to take our bed away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could fold that over . Once they 'd hoisted it , they joined the frame back together again . " She sighed and looked at the bed affectionately . " Maybe this will be its last resting place , " she went on . " Anyhow , I hope so . " " Why did you sell your Norwalk home ? " I asked her . " We 'd bought it in the first place be  --  cause when our daughter Heller was four we wanted her to have a few years of country life . At least I think she was four . I 'm very vague about facts . 1 try to stick to them , but I notice that if I say we did a thing ten years ago , it turns out to be twelve , and if I say it 's four , it turns out to be eight . I 'm never right . " " I 've discovered that too , " 1 said , " It 's always more years than you think . " " Always , " she agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was five . She played my little sister in Annie Get Your Gun . She went from that into Peter Pan . " A cog clicked in my head and I said , " She studied ballet , too , did n't she ? " " She was with the Sadler 's Wells Com  --  pany for two years when Richard and I were in England . She wanted to be the greatest ballerina in the world . " " Has she changed her mind ? " I asked . " This is what is so crazy , " Mary Martin told me . " She does n't want anything to do with the theater now . She wants to be a nurse . How can you figure children ? " I said I did n't know . I said that there had been a time when my own daughter had been in love with horses , but she 'd finally grown up to discover men more interesting . " I would n't blame children if they could n't figure us either , " Mary Martin said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we have this lovely , livable place , and tomorrow we 're leaving it to stay in hotels or motels for twenty. - four days and twenty-four nights to polish our Easter two-part TV show . " " Where ? " I asked . " All over , " she said . " We 've already played forty one-night stands and we have twenty-four more to go . We do n't get back here to New York until late March . " " Tell me about your tour , " I said . " I read that some of your friends came to Newark to catch your show when you played there . " " I do n't know much about geography , " she said , " although this tour is teach . ing me that like mad , so I did n't really know where Newark was , although 1 thought it 's probably not far from New York . " I did n't tell her I have a wife who. speaks of going " up to Florida " from Philadelphia . " No , " 1 said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We left Providence , Rhode Island , early one morning , " she went on . " We drove to Newark , and by the time we got there all I knew was that it was a long way from Providence . I was n't thinking of New York or our friends who live there . So when a lot of them showed up , dear friends like Vinton Freedley , who pro  --  duced the first show I was in , Leave it to - Me- 1 sang My Heart Belongs to Daddy in it ; and Radie Harris , a columnist for the Hollywood Reporter ; and darling Mr. Vincent , who at ninety-two is the head of the Actors ' Fund , or maybe he 's only ninety ; and Josh Logan and Leland Hay  --  ward  --  why I had a hard time choking back my tears , " " Speaking of columnists , " I said , . " Hedda Hopper wrote the best story about you I 've read . It appeared several years ago in a women 's magazine . " " f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But she had a run  --  ning start . She 's known me from the very beginning . " " I 'm glad she likes you , " I said . " There are people she does n't like . " " I 'm delighted she likes me , " Mary Martin said , " because I love her dearly . " " Why all these one-night stands ? " I asked . " I have wanted to play them for years , " she told me . " I missed all of that because my first New York show was successful , ' and as a result I never played summer stock or one-nighters . " I said that I was surprised there were enough theaters still open around the country to enable her to play sixty-four cities and towns . " They 've reopened some for me which have n't been open for twenty years , " she told me . " A few of them are real mouse 's nests , but I love them . When you make it in the theater in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' 1 must have a shower in my dressing room , ' but in the last few months I 've dressed in some odd places . Take Constitution Hall in Washington , D.C. The regular dressing room is so Far from the stage , and I had so many COS ' tame changes to make , with only a few seconds to make them in. that I had to dress in the men 's room . At least it said ' Men ' on the door . You should have seen me hanging my Mainbocher clothes over whatever I could find in there . " " You have n't told me about your show yet , " I said . " It 's a musical resume of my life , " she said . " I open with a song called The Song is You , and my theme is I Hear Music When I Look at You . When I finish the song , I tell the audience , ' Truer words were never said , because my song is you  --  and accomplished and who was also com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the street front our home . It was a beautiful school , but some crank who thought dancing was sinful set lire to it , When I first started teaching . a lot of my friends were n't sure dancing was proper . They stopped me on the street and told me , grim-lipped . TN let my child study tap , but no ballroom . ' " Sixteen floors below us u tug bellowed as it nursed a scow along the river . One part of my mind listened to her ; another part made mental notes of her costume . She was wearing a slack suit modeled after a ski suit . Its mustard-yellow cotton top had dolman sleeves . The high neck  --  line and the sleeves at the wrists were finished %%ith black knitted bands . The pants were dull black cotton , narrowing at the ankles . Black elastic , worn under the foot , held the pants tight . She wore the mustard-yellow top tucked inside the pants , and she had a mustard-yellow cummerbund closed with black leather straps around her waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actly the same voice Nellie Forbush had spoken with in South Pacific . " Usually they put me in the front row at Fanchon and Marco 's because I was younger than most of the other students  --  and although perhaps I should n't say it , I % as cuter . After all , some of them had been teach  --  ing for years . But I kept working my way to the back row , so I could copy the ex  --  perienced students in front of me . Then one day I wandered into the wrong class . There were hundreds of students in that room singing a song , ' How red the rose , how blue the sky , how sweet the morn  --  ing dew ... ' I thought , My goodness , this is interesting . just sit here and listen and watch . Then suddenly somebody said to me , ' You 're next , ' and by this time I 'd learned the song . So I thought , I 'll just get up and sing it , which I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of it I was told , ' Miss Fanchon wants to see you in her office . ' I 'd never met Miss Fanchon and I was terrified . I was sure I 'd done something wrong , but I went anyhow . There , behind a desk , was a lady I 'd seen listening to the auditions of How Red the Rose . ' What 's your name ? ' " ' Mary Martin , ' I told her . ' I come from Weatherford . Texas . I 'm taking a dancing teachers ' course . ' She asked , ' Then why were you singing ? ' " ' Well , I got into the wrong class , and since I was there I thought it would be fun to stay , ' I explained , ' but I did n't mean to do anything had . Wo n't you please forget I was there ? ' " ' I 'm sorry , but you won the audition , ' she said firmly , ' and you leave at seven-thirty in the morning for San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song while they dance . ' There were twenty-four Fanchonettes in the unit who did precision routines like the Rockettes . I was supposed to sing over a mike while they danced . " For a week t sang , ' How red the rose , how blue the sky , how sweet the morning dew , ' with the Fanchonettes . It was my first taste of show business and I found it delightfully habit-forming . So much so that when 1 went back to Weatherford , teaching dancing was n't exciting any more . So I went to father and told him I wanted to go back to California and con  --  tinue my studies . He said , ' All right , Poog , honey , if that 's what you want most ' ; so away I went again . This time became an auditioning fool . I must have been known as Auditioning Mary . I sang everywhere  --  in studios , at night clubs . The trouble was if I auditioned as a dancer , I was asked hopefully , ' Can you sing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked with an air of quiet despera  --  tion , ' Can you dance ? ' " " What did you use for money ? " 1 asked . " Daddy kept sending it to me , " she said , " but finally I got a job singing in a night club at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel . At teatime I sang Indian Love Call in the lounge for the ladies ; then I sang bar songs at night . " " Such as ? " I asked . " I 'm singing some of them on my tour , " she said . " Exactly Like You , The Very Thought of You and It 's Movely . It was great training . The people at the Hollywood Roosevelt were wonderful to me . The man in charge fretted about my welfare and made sure that nobody of  --  fered me a drink . On the strength of that job I got other jobs , but no big ones . Then came a night at the Trocadero . " Thinking of it made her stand up and walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolman sleeves and her dull black cotton pants , she was very small and very appealing . " I 'll never forget it , " she said . " It was a Sunday Talent Scout night , and everybody was there from every studio in town , including celebrities like Jack Benny , Mr. Zanuck and Joe Pasternak. 1 had auditioned for most of those people . but they did n't remember me . Of all things , I picked // Barba to sing . I started it straight ; then , because was afraid everybody would get up and leave , I began to swing it the way I 'd swung it for my father . Apparently they had never heard anybody swing classical music , and it wowed them . Instead of leaving , people stood up and yelled . " She went on , " That night changed my life . As soon as I finished singing , the stage producer , Laurence Schwab , signed me to come to New York to do a show for him , and the next morning every studio called me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every one of them had already tested me , but noth  --  ing had ever happened . The craziest thing of all was when Twentieth Century-Fox called my agent  --  by this time I had more agents than friends  --  and asked him if I 'd discuss a deal . ' We 'll be glad to send a car for Miss Martin , ' the man at Fox said . " Fox sent a car for me , and that car let me out at the front office and another car drove me to the talent office , which was only across the street . What swank ! And only two days before , I 'd walked all over the Fox lot trying to locate my pay check for dubbing my voice for Gypsy Rose Lee 's voice in a song called Battling Down Broadway . But I 'd already signed with Mr. Schwab , and I was happy about that because the theater was really where I wanted to be . " Anyhow , in 1936 I came to New York from Galveston on a cattle boat . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked out the St. Moritz Hotel because its name sounded so pretty . Laurence Schwab was out of town , but he called and said , ' We ca n't do the show I signed you for be  --  cause I 've lost too much on the show I 'm with now . In fact , we 're folding it out of town . But do n't worry , I 'll be back soon . Something will turn up . ' " After I 'd been in New York two weeks , he called and said , ' Would you audition again ? ' and I thought , Oh , no . After all these years of auditioning ! But of course I did . In fact , I could n't wait . Mr. Schwab told me , ' We 're going to the Ritz Tower . ' The Ritz Tower meant nothing to me , but we got off an elevator into a room filled to the walls with people . As a result of previous auditions , I had learned if I sang one song , then stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame because I sang so many different ways  --  blues , sweet , high , low  --  so when I went into that room I said , ' I will sing four songs for you . If I ca n't sing all four , I do n't wish to sing at all . ' " There was a great silence , and I ex  --  pected darling Laurence Schwab to drop dead . I could n't do that now . Imagine me having that much nerve ! But the others said , ' All right , ' so I sang a naughty song , A Weekend in the Life of a Private Secretary ; and II Bacio once more , and Oh , Rock it for Me ; then I sang a ballad . " A little woman came up to me and said , ' Have you ever been on the stage before ? ' 1 did n't know what to say . I thought , If I tell her the truth , that I 've been on the stage only once  --  that time for Fanchon and Marco  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have enough experi  --  ence . ' If I say , ' Yes , 1 have , ' they 'll soon find out I have n't . So I said , ' Whatever it is , I can do it . 1 know I can do it . ' " The little woman said , ' My name is Bella Spewak . This is my husband , Sam Spewak . We write plays . This is Vinton Freedley , and this is Sophie Tucker , and this is Victor Moore . Over there at the piano is Cole Porter . ' " Golly ! I 'd sung for all those famous people and I had n't known it . I thought , This is the end . Holy stupid can one girl get ! Then I went back to my hotel . Laurence Schwab tried to cheer me up by telling me that I 'd done a good audition , but I knew we 'd just have to wait and See . " Late that afternoon Bella Spewak called me and asked , ' Would you come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I did n't know that the show they were casting had been in rehearsal for two and a half weeks . It had been all ready to open when its leading lady , June Knight . suddenly up and married a Texan and walked out . He did n't want her on the stage . For one thing , he thought her main song , My Heart Belongs to Daddy , was slightly on the suggestive side . " I 'd never seen the inside of a theater looking like that  --  only one big bare light bulb blazing , I mean . A man with his hat pulled down over his eyes was walking around the stage , and somebody said , ' Stand beside him . ' Somebody else said , ' Here are some words . Say them . ' The man with the hat said to me from the corner of his mouth , ' It does n't matter how you say them , just say them so laud they 'll reach to the balcony . ' My firm line was , ' I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f looked up at the balcony and said , ' I 'D LIKE TO RENEW MY SUIISCRIP TION .. I said a few more lines , and Sum Spewak came down the aisle and said , ' Come back tomorrow morning , but never , never change that reading . Say it exactly the way that you have just said it , ' " On the opening night in New Haven , when I stepped out on the stage and said my first line , the audience howled . I thought my dress had fallen off , or some  --  thing equally dreadful had happened . I did n't know my line was funny because I did n't know what had led up to it . They 'd been very careful to show me only the lines I had to say ; not the lines the other people in the cast were given , The idea was to make sure that I sounded like the dumb bunny I was supposed to portray , I guess . " " You must have found out what the others were saying later , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that I had been Billy Gax  --  ton 's girl , " she said . " Billy was the man who had been walking around with his hat pulled down over his eyes , and in the i show he sold magazine subscriptions , orb maybe it was newspaper subscriptions . Anyhow , we 'd had a row and we 'd severed our romantic relations . But I 'd ' thought better of it-1 'd gotten lone ! or something  --  so 1 pranced into his of flee and said , To LIKE TO RENEW SUBSCRIPTION ! ' I 'm afraid some of th earthier souls in that audience read double meaning into that statement Then I sang My Heart Belongs to Daddy that really did it . I was surprised , and s ' was everybody else when it stopped th. ' show . " " Did anyone teach you how to put i over ? " I asked . " Sophie Tucker did , " she said . " On . day at rehearsal Sophie came up to m and said , ' Kid , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , as a matter a fact , 1 do n't ' , and she said , ' I had hunch you do n't know what your lyri mean . Always remember this , kid , whe you 're asked to sing a dirty line  --  l'v ' been singing them for years  --  look straigh up to heaven when you sing It . Neve look at the audience . ' That was Sophie ' theory , and she was right . The extra al of innocence it lent ' Daddy ' gave th. song extra wallop . " " Then what happened ? " I asked . " Then Richard came into my life , ' she said , " He heard me sing ' Daddy ' th night the show opened in New York , bu he could n't stand me . I did n't know him but we had mutual friends who kept tell ing me that they had this eligible yours bachelor they wanted me to meet . was n't interested . I was going with an other eligible bachelor I found very at tractive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exactly rushing arount trying to meet young men just because they happened to be unmarried . " Later that year Paramount decide ( to give me a screen test , and every Para mount executive O.K. 'd my test exceP Mr. Halliday , who was outvoted . Whet I went to Hollywood , Richard went ti the coast to reorganize the Paramour ' story department . By coincidence arrived the same day , but we still dido meet . That was all changed at a poll ! given by a movie executive , John Mc ' Cormick . His guest list included Jar Arthur and Frank Ross , who was he.o. husband at that time , Richard and mYsel and a few others . It was the first time ever seen Richard , and I thought Mr most attractive , but he only looked at in ( Once . All ( Continued on Page // ( Conrinued from Page 116 ) I he rest 01 ' the evening he was being terribly nice to Jean Arthur , which seemed a waste of time to me because , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and I had to be at the studio at six in the morning , so said to John McCormick , ' I have to go . ' He said , ' I 'll call my car and take you . ' Then , out of the blue , Richard said , ' 1 'm going that way . I 'll take you . ' So he did . We sat in front of my apartment and talked until three o'clock in the morning . 1 do n't know why we knew that was it , but we knew it . " After that we saw a lot of each other , Then one night we ran away to Las Vegas and were married , but because once more I had to be at the studio at the crack of dawn , we drove all the way back to Hollywood that very same night . " She made a wry face and said , " A fine honeymoon ! For that matter , a fine mar  --  rieiV  --  fe we had for a while ! For Richard anu never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time we did see each other was when we met in different cars going in opposite directions past a traffic light , and we 'd wave at each other . Finally WC decided that was a stupid way to go on living and that we had to be together more . " Anyway , " she went on , " I could n't stand the pictures I was in . I wept every time I saw one , and I did everything in the world to get out of my contract . Eventually we left California , came back to New York and 1 did a stage show , One Touch of Venus . " I said , " I 've heard that when it was suggested to you that you play Venus , you could n't believe anybody really wanted you for that part . " " I could n't , " she said . " My goodness , they had wanted Marlene Dietrich to play Venus , but she could n't , and I did n't see how anyone could have thought of me and Marlene at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all kinds of Venuses . Have you ever been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ? ' I said , ' No , ' and he said , ' Let 's go . ' So we went to the Metropolitan and he showed me short , fat Venuses and medium ones and long , skinny ones . I picked out a me  --  dium-sized one with a derriere that was n't too small . I decided that she looked like me and I said , ' You mean that 's a Venus ? Well , what do you know ? Maybe I could be one too . ' " Richard 's next move was to take me to the couturier , Mainbocher . He had never done a musical show , but Richard persuaded him to take me on . In Holly  --  wood the studio had draped me with hair ; l had had curls hanging down to there . But Mainbocher pulled my long blond hair back  --  or whatever color it was then ; I guess it was blond  --  and said , ' Your hair should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' I 've always told her that , ' All of a sudden I was so changed that I felt attractive . " Mainbocher also had some ideas about how to dress me . He revealed everything the movies had hidden . They had always covered up my neck with froth . O.K. , let 's face it . my neck is too long , my nose is too big , my chin is too pointed ; my cheeks do go in too far . Before I went to Hollywood , 1 did n't think I was too painful to look at , but from the way the studio acted , anyone would have thought me one of the most unattractive girls anywhere . " Mainbocher had a theory about my back too , " Mary Martin went on . " He thought it was a good back , but nobody had ever seen it because it had been covered up . So he took everything off it . He still does that . On my present tour I have a dress with no back at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get hack to Venus  --  it was a hit . It ran for two years . " " Do you still owe Paramount a pic  --  ture ? " I asked . " I owe them six I 'll never make , " she said . " They gave me a leave of absence ; it has lasted fourteen years . After Venus I did Line Song , and once more I said to Richard , ' I ca n't play the lead . She 's a Chinese lady , ' and Richard said , ' You certainly can , ' so I did . I learned Chinese movements by watching myself in a mirror . I worked hard to make those movements right . I do that in every show . To me , movements arc very important , " The next thing that happened to her was a cable from Noel Coward . He asked her to come to England because he 'd written a musical . " I 'd never been to England , " she told me , " and as for Noel Coward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weatherford , so we went . I had a part in his musical , which was n't too successful , It was called Pacific 1860 , and everybody thought it was a telephone number . While we were there we got a cable from Dick Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein , asking us if I 'd do Annie Get Your Gun for them in England . We cabled back : WE WANTTO COME HOME , WE 'VE BEEN GONE TOO LONG . BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO YOUR SHOW ON THE ROAD IN THE U.S.A , So we did that for about eleven months and I adored it . 1 do n't think anybody can be a better Annie than Ethel Merman , but at least I was different , I was com  --  pletely Merman 's opposite , if that meant anything . " " Speaking of Merman , " 1 said , " one of TV 's high points was the show you two did together sitting on two stools . People have been sitting on stools on TV ever since . " " Merman is fabulous , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that show was a fluke . I 'd never wanted to do television . It was too much like the movies , and the movies had given me too much unhappi  --  ness . When we ended the run of South Pacific  --  I 'll get to South Pacific later  --  Richard and I took a trip all over Europe . Everywhere we stopped there was a trans  --  atlantic telephone call from Leland Hay  --  ward asking us , ' When will you be back ? Will you do a TV show for me ? ' And we kept saying , ' No . ' " We were on a freighter bound for Cuba when we had a marconigram from Leland , ' Meeting you in Havana , It 's lovely there this time of year . ' When our freighter pulled in , there was Leland wait  --  ing on the wharf . We did have a lovely time , but Leland said nothing about TV . Finally I said , ' 1 ca n't stand it . I know you 're here to talk about your television show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' The one you 've been calling us about , ' I said . " ' Now that you mention it , ' he said , ' I do have a great idea for a TV show . I know how fond you are of Merman , and I 've been thinking , Would n't it he nice if Merman visited you on your show and sang one song with you ? ' ? It would be great , ' I said , ' but you could never get her to do it . ' He said , ' I think she 'd love to work with you . ' He added hurriedly , ' Of course , the who e show is yours . ' And I said , ' I 'd give any  --  thing in the world to do that with Mer  --  man . ' " Apparently that so-and-so Hayward said the same thing to Merman ?

We did n't find this out until we began to rehearse . One afternoon Merman asked me , ' What is your understanding with Leland ? ' And 1 said . ' What is yours ? ' Then we both told each other and we died laughing , for by that time we were having a ball . " 1 said I 'd tell you about South Pacific , After touring the country with the road company of Annie , I had a call from Dick Rodgers asking me if I 'd do a show with Ezio Pinza . I thought Dick was kidding because , after doing ' Annie ' for so many months , I was croaking like Tallulah Bankhead , although I 'd visited every throat doctor in the United States . I had had a bad cold , which had turned into laryngitis , and I had tried to sing above it , until my voice threatened to become per  --  manently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much higher than Pinza 's , so asked Dick Rodgers , ' What do you want , two bassos ? ' but he insisted he wanted me anyhow . 1 had read South Pacific and found it delightful , but I said to my bug . band , ' Who wants to play a nurse going around in one white uniform all the time ? I ca n't see that . ' And Richard said , ' Do n't say no . Let 's think about it. ? " You owe Richard a lot , do n't you ? " I asked . " Only everything , " she said with pas  --  sionate conviction . " Richard thinks things through more clearly than I do , and he knows what I can do better than 1 know . He works at least ten hours a day handling my affairs . He gets up between five and six every morning , and sometimes he 's at the theater until two A.M. He tries to pro  --  tect me , but I try to protect him too . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone until he 's had his first meal of the day . " " Let 's get back to South Pacific , " I said . " You were talking to Richard about whether to be in it or not . " She went on , " We decided to drive from San Francisco to Connecticut through Canada . We thought about South Pacific all the way . When we got to New York , Josh Logan asked us , ' Will you come up to Dick Rodgers ' house and listen to the only two songs he and Oscar have written , and we 'll tell you what we plan to do in this show ? ' We sat there while Dick played Some Enchanted Eve  --  ning and I 'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy , and we both tried not to say any  --  thing because we 'd told Josh we wanted to wait twenty-four hours before we made up our minds . When it was over we said , ' We 've had a lovely afternoon ; and we went home . Two hours later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait twenty-four hours ? Ca n't we say yes now ? ' " Mary Martin played the leading femi  --  nine role in South Pacific for three and a half years  --  two and a half in New York and a year in London . Then she did Peter Pan . She and Richard had talked about Peter for thirteen years , but something had always stopped them . They could n't get the rights or it cost too much , but finally they did it . " It had the greatest advance sale any nonmusical show ever had on Broadway , " she told me . " I think it was 5700,000 . It made a lot of money even though it played only a limited en  --  gagement of fourteen weeks . " But to get back to the musicography of my life , 1 ' 11 be telling it on N.B.C.-TV this year on Easter Sunday afternoon and evening . My afternoon show will be called Magic With Mary Martin and my evening show will be called Music With Mary Martin . I 've told my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the run of South Pacific I told it so often I grew sick of it . One day a nice reporter , Cyn  --  this Lowry , came up to Connecticut to interview me . When she walked in she said , ' I really do n't know anything about you . ' I asked her , ' Are you sure ? ' and when she said , ' Yes , ' I said , ' Come with me , ' and we went down to the pool and I really told her a story . 1 said that I 'd been born on an Indian reservation and that my mother was an Indian . I 've forgotten what I told her daddy was  --  probably a buffalo hunter  --  and she said , ' What a story ! ' Even after we 'd had lunch she was still saying , ' What a story ! ' " When 1 said , ' I 'm glad you like it be  --  cause I 'm sick of my own , ' she did a double-take and threatened me , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to print it exactly the way you told it to me . ' So I told her a more accurate story , and we had a lovely time . " " But today you 've told me the truth ? " I asked . " Today , " she said , " I 've told you the truth . "
