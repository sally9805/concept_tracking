Letters to The Times For Policy of liberation Poznan Riots Said to Point Up Need for Strong Stand The writer , Of the following letter was formerly Ambassador to Poland . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read with great interest the letter which appeared in your issue of July 10 from my esteemed friend Zygmunt Nagorski on the question of the Poznan riots . Without wishing- to contradict what Mr. Nagorski so sagely says , I would , however , like to add some comments from a purely American point of view . I think they may throw some light on the origins of the movement and may teach the American people a lesson as to what we may expect , no matter in what country , if the American people should forget its promises on behalf of mankind . Perhaps I can best illustrate the attitude of the Polish people , as well as that of other peoples who found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citing the remark of a very cultured Polish lady who had been active in the underground in Warsaw . She asked me incredulously , " Is it really true that you Americans joined up with the Russian Communists in giving Polish territory to the Soviet Union ? " What we in America have forgotten is that the Poles , just like all of the other peoples who are today under Soviet domination , can not appreciate why ' we in righteous ? indignation talk about democracy and freedom and at the same time have been responsible for the suppression of such liberties through arbitrary action on the part of the Executive branch of the United States Government . Our Polish friends have been all too lenient in their appraisal of American foreign policy . The United States has good reason to recall with gratitude the contribution which Poles such as Kosciuszko and Pulaski made to the independence of the United ' States . We on our part should appreciate that , the Polish riots are but the beginning of an independence movement throughout all of Soviet-controlled Europe which our Government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ' ways I by which this can be accomplished is by the reiteration , and not only in a Presidential election year  --  that we stand for a policy of liberation . That was the keynote of the Republican platform at Chicago in 1952 . Unfortunately , that policy was not carried out although it is now being reechoed during the current campaign . If we are . to convince foreign peoples ' of our ? oWn sincerity in preaching the . doctrine of freedom and democracy we innst. first convince ourselves that We are honest . And we can not do this if we preach platitudes only'in election years . ARTHUR BLISS LANE . Washington , July 10 , 1956 . Developing Niagara 's Power To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a full-page advertisement in The Times of July 1 Robert Moses , through the use of Power Authority funds , seems to give the impression that those who have opposed taxfree development of Niagara power facilities have abandoned the fight . That is not true . Even though the power companies may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 200 agricultural , business , civic , labor and political organizations cooperating through the Inter-Organization Conference on Power Resources have not changed their position . We are against tee , c-free generating and trgnsportation facilities financed by tax-exempt bonds . The BuckleyLehman bills ? would shift the burden from power users to the taxpayer . The principal beneficiary under the Moses public power plan would be the very rich buyer of Mr. Moses ' tax-exempt bonds . We are so informing members of Congress . WILLIAM A. MILLS , Secretary , Inter-Organization Conference on Power Resources . Albany , N. Y. , July 10 , .1956 . Stevenson 's Aid Recalled To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Michael Prendergast 's letter in The Times of June 28 booming the candidacy of Governor Harriman mentions that President Eisenhower " was brought into New York State to bolster the Republican Gubernatorial candidate " in 1954 , but that in spite of this , Harriman won .. Mr. Prendergast conveniently fails to recall that his man did not fight his battle alone : Adlai Stevenson devoted a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of Harriman . As the political pundits pointed out then , Stevenson 's reputation , like Eisenhovier 's , was on the line . StevensOn 's help . in edging Harriman over the top was acknowledged at the time even by the new Governor , still humbly grateful and somewhat less ambitious than now . JOHN B. CURRIE . Cornwall , Conn. , June 29 , 1956 . Powell Amendment Approved To tip EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Perhaps : you would like to know at least one Southerner 's reaction to the ' Powell amendment ' to the bill concerning Federal aid to education : Naturally , I regret that the ' bill was not passed . But I think that the amendment to the bill was a triumph of justice . I believe that to desegregate the public schools in the South is the . only right and Christian thing to do . Therefore , any measure adopted by . the Federal Government to give Federal funds to schools should be restricted to those states which guarantee at leest a tolerable justice according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice for the Negro . Under the present conditions in my native region I ' am not so sure that Government appropriations would have found their way to Negro schools , which beyond the shadow of a doubt need them most . The defeat of the amendment may have been a setback to the cause of better education , but it was a step toward the triumph of justice . Let us hope that the day will come when such amendments to bills in Congress will not be necessary .. J. MASON STAPLETON Jr. , Assistant Minister , Whitmire Methodist Church . ? Whitmire , S. C. , July 7 , 1956 . Stand of Marxist Group Socialist Labor Party Opposition . to Soviet System Affirmed To ' THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a Marxist I should like to say that you were 100 per cent correct in stating that " Stalin could never have achieved his absolute power if there were not strong forces within the country whom his rule benefited . " You were right , too , in identifying , these forces as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and diverted to itself and its own consumption a vastly disproportionate portion of the national income . " Also , I subscribe fully to ? your statement that it is a " myth that the means of production are in the hands of the workers and peasants " in Russia . But in all this you were right only as far as you went  --  and you did not go far enough . For years the Socialist Labor party has called the Soviet system a " bureaucratic despotism . " And it has shown in some detail that the bureaucracy is a product of the anti-Marxist concept of nationalization and state ownership . The Socialist Labor party agrees with Marx that " the existence of the State is inseparable from the existence of slavery . " It holds that under bona fide socialism there will be no state , which is to say no political government based on geographic constituences , Instead there will be a government based on industrial representation , or a Socialist industrial republic . In such a government the workers will vote where they work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the plant right up to the national industrial congress . This set-up completely eliminates the selfinterested bureaucrat operating under a political boss . It truly places the means of production in the handa of the workers . ERIC Hass , Candidate for President , Socialist Labor party . New York , July 6 , 1956 ; ? That Unnamed Musical To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Woe is irrevocably me ! In some 700 fascinating words the July 6 Topics of The Times is dedicated to the ordeal of the hedonists. who start to line up at dawn in the lee of an unnamed theatre " in quest of standing-room tickets to the notable musical representation installed therein . " Is n't the author of this tribute , and The Times , too , derelict in fail ? ing to identify the hit . which attracts these fanatics as a magnet attracts steel filings ? As the foe of anonymity , as a man who calls a spade a spade such time as he does n't get it confused with a steam shovel , this omission outrages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man wax chary about the show which your Brooks Atkinson cites as " one of the best musicals of the century " ? In behalf of George Bernard Shaw , producer Herman Levin , adapters Alan Jay - Lerner and Frederick , ' Loewe , director Moss Hart and stars Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews , I ask that he make an agonizing reappraisal and blurt out the name of the musical . . RICHARD ' MANEY . Press Representative , " My , Fair Lady . " ' New York , July 6 , 1956 . Castillo Armes Defended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TILfIta : We energetically protest your editorial of June 28 against the constructive and patriotic Government of Colonel Castillo Armes , which is in the front row of countries which combat communism . ' We are with him and we support fair measures to protect the Guatemalan people . ' RIGOBERTO SOSA MORALES , Jose AZURDIA . Guatemala . City , . July 10 , 1956.                    @
