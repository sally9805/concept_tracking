Enthusiastic rocket men are convinced that , given enough money , they could begin right now to build a rocket that would carry men to the moon . Better still , they could put together an artificial satellite , a sort of interstellar service station , observation platform and motel ( TIME , Sept. 17 ) . The foreseeable difficulties can be shrugged off as mere " engineering details . " <P> But one problem is more than an engineering detail : Can men survive the wild , high ride into outer space ? Last week in Washington , Drs . J. P. Henry and E. R. Ballinger of the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base told how mice and monkeys are helping them find an answer . <P> Three white mice , one with part of the balance mechanism of his inner ear destroyed , were put in pressurized compartments in the noses of rockets . Movie cameras recorded their reactions as they shot into the thin upper atmosphere over White Sands , N. Mex . As the rockets neared the peak of their flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell toward earth . For a few insane moments until they slowed down in dense air , the mice were essentially weightless . Buoyant and panicky , the two normal ones thrashed in their chambers until they felt the familiar pull of gravity again . The third , without equilibrium from the start , curled up in a nook and seemed not to care what was happening . <P> Five monkeys , with whom the doctors seemed to feel more identification , were better treated . They were anesthetized before being shot aloft . Doped on morphine and resting quietly on sponge-rubber beds , they rode 80 mi. into space . All the while , instruments registered the reactions of their cardiovascular and circulatory systems and the changes in their breathing . Radioed back to earth , this information suggested that the monkeys were not seriously disturbed . At any rate , not until they landed . Four died when their rockets ' parachutes failed to open . A fifth got down safely , but-still unconscious from morphine-died of heat prostration in the desert . <P> Valuable as they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove little about what will happen to men-or even animals-during the longer weightless periods of full-dress space travel . Monkeys and mice have not seen the end of this sort of thing . When bigger &; better rockets are built , the scientists will be calling on them for help with still more answers .
