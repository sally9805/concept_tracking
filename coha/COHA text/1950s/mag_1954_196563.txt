Wherever jet planes crisscross the skies , the U.S. is acknowledged to be strong . Wherever dollars go , it is acknowledged to be rich . No lucky by-blows of fortune , this strength and wealth are products of a national character . In recent decades , the national character has not been so plain as its products . That is why the U.S. , more than it is understood , is feared for its strength and courted for its money . <P> All heads of state have a primary , supraconstitutional duty to express the national character so that foreigners and , even more importantly , the state 's own citizens will understand it . Seldom has this function been better performed than in Dwight Eisenhower 's second State of the Union message-the first since he developed the new , firm grasp on his formidable job ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) . <P> The message is specific , pragmatic and programmatic-as befits a business nation . The President invented no new goals , avoided argument with the concepts of his predecessors , rang no alarms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proposals runs a clear , consistent thread , joining each fact and each measure with all the others . The thread is the general good . He has not thrown together a hodgepodge of group interests . Every proposal-especially the well-defined new stragetic program and the sections on the domestic economy-seems to have been tested by the standard of the whole nation 's interest . <P> It is a waste of time to try to judge this message by how closely it conforms to the Roosevelt and Truman policies , or how far it departs from them . Eisenhower is not trying to expunge the New Deal , or to project it . He is taking off from the facts of life as they are in the U.S. , A.D. 1954 , and going on from there to outline , in a new tone of confidence , a new course . <P> For all its strength and all its wealth , the U.S. has been reacting skittishly to internal pressures and external alarms . It has not been moving on a path consciously and deliberately chosen . The President notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into U.S. hands . That is no accident . Initiative is a bird that can-be snared only by a firm purpose . It will never roost for those-however strong or rich or right-who do not know what they want to do with it .
