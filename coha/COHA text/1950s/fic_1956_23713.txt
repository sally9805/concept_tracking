A Story by Isaac Rosenfeld Drawings by Laszlo Mutulay King Solomon 1 . WITH HIS WOMEN F4 VERY year , a certain number of girls . They come to him , lie down beside him , place their hands on his breast and offer to become his slaves . This goes on all the time . " I will he your slave , " say the girls , and no more need be said . But Solomon 's men , his counselors , ca n't bear it  --  what is this power of his ? Some maintain it is no power at all , he is merely the King . Oh yes , admit the rest , his being the King has something to do with it  --  but there have been other kings , so it ca n't be that . Nor is it anything else . Consider how unprepossessing he is , what a poor impression he makes  --  why , most of the counselors are taller , handsomer , and leaner than he . To be sure , he has an excellent voice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has air unlisted number which no one would give out . Certainly not , say the men . Still , the girls keep coming , and they lie down beside him with their hands on his breast . It is not enough to say the counselors are jealous . After all , there is something strange here , the like of it has not been seen . But who shall explain the King ? Solomon himself makes no comment , he does not speak of his personal affairs . He may drop a hint or two , but these hints arc contradictory and vague , and he drops them only for his ownamusement ; perhaps he , too , does n't know . Every few years he publishes a collection of his sayings , most of which he has never said , but the sayings have little to do with the case , and their melancholy tone is held to be an affectation . The wisest counselors pay no attention to his words . If anything is to be learned , the wise men say , it had better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . The rejected go away in tears  --  in which case one can not expect them to speak coherently or with regard for truth ; or they are determined yet to win his love  --  and again they will tell lies . As for the women he accepts , they are useless . Almost at once they become so much like Solomon , adopting his mannerisms of gesture and speech and sharing his views of things , that they say only what he would say  --  and Solomon does not speak his heart . So it has become the custom in the court to study Solomon 's women in their work ; perhaps the manner in which they serve him will make it clear . The counselors watch over the harem , each chooses a woman to follow about the palace , over the grounds and through the town . One woman ... there she goes ! ... sets out early in the morning with a basket , trailed by a counselor . She makes her way to the largest and most crowded kosher market , where she will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway robbery ! And what delicacies does she buy ? Surely pickles and spices , the rarest and the best . . . . Not necessarily , it may even be noodles . So who is the wiser ? And as for the obvious conclusion  --  that Solomon sets store by economy  --  this has long since been drawn . He even lunches on left-overs . Others clean his shoes , open and sort the mail , tend the garden and the vineyards , keep his instruments polished and in tune . A few go to the well for water  --  a curious assignment , as the palace has had hot and cold running water for years . Perhaps he sends them to the well on purpose , to confuse the counselors . But if this occupation serves only to deceive , why not all the rest ? This may well be the case . King Solomon has a staff of regular servants , quite capable of looking after his needs . Therefore nothing has been learned . The counselors are always confronted by the same questions at nightfall , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time , he sits quietly with a girl or two , pasting stamps in an album , while they massage his scalp . On festive nights , the counselors note the revelry and participate , when invited , in the dancing and carousing . Not that this enchants them ; many counselors complain that the King has no taste in entertainment , that he relies , for instance , too heavily on tambourines , which he has his dancing girls flutter in their hands till the jingling gives one a headache ; that much the same or better amusements can be had in the cabarets about the town which  --  so much for Solomon 's originality  --  have been the source of many a spectacle of the King 's court  --  and theyeven have newspaper clippings to prove the point . Nevertheless , they succumb to the King 's merrymaking , and even if it makes them puke with disdain , still they lose the essential detachment . And then at the hour when the King retires to his chamber with his chosen love , all is lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , to lie awake or dream enviously through the night . All the same , a pertinacious lot . What stratagems , disguising themselves as eunuchs or hiding in vases or behind the furniture to learn what goes on at night ! Here , too , they have been disappointed . Though Solomon burns soft lights beside his couch , no one has witnessed anything ? or at least has ever reported what he saw . At the last moment the hidden counselors have shut their eyes or turned away ; no one has dared look at the King 's nakedness , dared to witness his love . Still , sounds have been heard boating in deep summer air over the garden and the lily pond , mingling with the voices of frogs  --  but the intrusion has been its own punishment , maddening those who have overheard the King and driving them wild with lust or despair . Sooner or later , the counselors have been compelled to stopper their ears . Now when these sounds issue from the King 's apartments , the counselors take up instruments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds within their own . None has seen the King 's nakedness ; yet all have seen him in shirt sleeves or suspenders , paunchy , loose-jowled , in need of a trim . Often in the heat of the day he appears bareheaded , and all have looked upon his baldness ; sometimes he comes forth in his bare feet , and the men have observed bunions and corns . When he appears in this fashion with , say , a cigar in his mouth and circles under his eyes ; his armpits showing yellowish and hairy over the arm holes of his undershirt ; his wrinkles deep and his skin slack ; a wallet protruding from one hip pocket and a kerchief from the other  --  at such moments , whether he he concerned with issues of government or merely the condition of the plumbing , he does show himself in human nakedness after all , he is much like any man , he even resembles a policeman on his day off or a small-time gambler . And sometimes , unexpectedly , he summons the cabinet to a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcended them . 0 F LA T E , King Solomon has turned his attention to the young . He has organized bicycle races for children , entertained them with magicians , taken them on picnics and ex-cursions to the zoo . He loves to sit on a shady bench with a youngster on either knee , a boy and a girl , about four or five in age . They pull at his beard , tug at his cars , and finger his spectacles till he can no longer see through the smudges . Sometimes , the children are his own , more often not . It makes no difference , the King has many sons and daughters . He tells stories , not nearly so amusing as they should be , old stories which the children grew tired of in the nursery , or poor inventions , rather pointless on the whole . And he seldom finishes a story but begins to nod in the telling , his words thicken and stumble ; eventually he falls asleep . Solomon is a disappointment to the young , seldom will children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is truly a king : robed and gowned , golden-sandaled , wearing a crown , his hair trimmed , his beard washed lustrous , combed , and waved , and the hairs plucked out of his nostrils . And in this splendor , in which he seldom appears , not even for the reception of ambassadors , he loves to bounce a rubber ball and play catch with the children . He is unskilled at these games , they call him butter-fingers . A man turning sixty , an aging king . But how clear is the expression of his eyes as he plays with the children  --  if only one knew what it meant ? Perhaps he longs to reveal himself but does not know how ; or does not know that the people await this revelation ; or is unable to see beyond the children , who are bored with him . Perhaps he has nothing to reveal , and all his wisdom lies scattered from his hand : he is merely this , that , and the other , a few buildings raised , roads leveled , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Occasionally , when he recognizes the expectation of the people , he tries to remember an appropriate saying from one of the collections he has published . Most of the time , he is unaware of all this . The children are fretful in the garden , they wait to be delivered . They have been brought by mothers , nurses , older sisters , who stand outside the gate , looking in through the palings . The mothers and nurses whisper together , their feet and eyes and hands are restless , they look at his shining beard . Later in the afternoon , when the children have been led home , perhaps one of the older girls , one of the sisters , will enter the same garden , approach the spot where the King lies resting , lie down beside him , fold her hands upon his breast , and offer to become his slave . 2 . THE QUEEN OF SHEBA F R 0 M all over they have come , and they keep coming , though the King is now an old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown lenient , admitting women to concubinage whom , the counselors swear , he would have sent packing in the old days . He has reached the years when anything young looks good to him This may not be true , there may be other reasons ; but the counselors have a point in saying that the standards have fallen , and they tell the story of the Queen of Sheba . A letter came , it was the first application to be received by mail , From a foreign country , the woman signed herself The Queen . She flattered Solomon 's wisdom , word of which had reached her from afar ; her own ears longed to hear his discourse , her own eyes , to behold his person . An unorthodox application , written in a powerful , forward-rushing , though feminine hand on strangely scented paper : the King said it reminded him of jungles . He inspected the postmark , clipped off the stamp , and pasted it on a page by itself in his album . His expression was hidden in his beard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with travel stickers . They came on sand-choked , sneezing camels , in long trains , attended by drivers , natives of the Land of Sheba . The next day , more boxes , and again on the third . Gifts of all description , of money and goods , spangles and bangles for the entire court . It made an excellent impression , but Solomon , who distributed the gifts , did not seem pleased . . . . Here the counselors pretend to know the King 's mind . First of all , they say , he was annoyed at having to put up so many camels , whole droves of them  --  his stables were crowded , and there was a shortage of feed for his own animals . Then the camel drivers , rough and barbarous men , were inflamed by the sight of Solomon 's women , and the King had to double the guard and pay overtime ; this killed him . But their greatest presumption lies in saying that Solomon thought , " Adonai Elohenu ! Is she coining to stay ? " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been glad that the Queen was coming . No queen had ever before asked to be his slave  --  and she was a queen for sure , and of a rich country , think of the gifts she had sent . Solomon put his economists to work and they submitted a report : the financial structure was sound , and the country led in the produc-CHADWICK HANSEN During tion of myrrh , pepper , and oil . Now to be sure , the Queen 's letter made no direct application ; apart from the flattery , it merely said , coming for a visit , as an equal might say . But the interpretation was clear . An equal would not come uninvited , only one who meant to offer herself would do so  --  unless the Queen was rude ; but the gifts she had sent took care of that . Yet as a queen , writing from her own palace , she could not have expressed the intention , it would have been treason to her own people . Nevertheless , she had every intention : otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is , there was rejoicing in the palace , Solomon himself led the dancing , and he declared a holiday when the Queen of Sheba arrived . She came in a howdah , on a camel , preceded by troops of archers and trumpeters . Solomon helped her down , and washed and anointed her feet in the courtyard . This did n't come off so well . Sheba used coloring matter on her toenails and the soles of her feet , and the coloring ran ; Solomon was out of practice , he tickled her feet a few times and made her laugh . The ceremony was supposed to be a solemn one , the people took it very seriously , and they were offended by her toenails  --  feet were supposed to be presented dusty : as for the giggling , it was unpardonable , and the priests took offense . A poor set of omens . Besides , Sheba was not quite so young as the autographed picture , which she had sent in advance to Solomon , would have led one to expect . Her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had apparently made some effort to straighten , had gone frizzled and kinky again in the heat of the desert crossing . She wore anklets of delicate chain , gold bracelets all over her arms , and jewels in both obvious and unexpected places , so that the eye was never done seeing them ; their light was kept in constant agitation by the massive rhythm of her breathing , which involved her entire body . A sense of tremendous power and authenMe ticity emanated from her breasts . Some thought she was beautiful , others , not . No one knows what the King thought ; but he may well have felt what everyone else did who came to witness her arrival  --  drawn , and at the same time , stunned . But the King is glad in his heart as he leads Sheba to the table , where . he has put on a great spread for her . He is attended by his court and surrounded by his women  --  and how lordly are his movements as he eats meat and rinses his mouth with wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's presence  --  after all , this is no maiden lurking in the garden to trip up to him and fold her hands upon his breast . The meal goes well enough : Sheba asks for seconds , and seems impressed with the napkins and silverware . But suddenly , right in the middle of dessert , she turns to him and demands , in front of everyone and that all may hear , that he show her his famous wisdom . This comes as something of a shock . The implication is two-fold : that so far he has spoken commonplaces ; and secondly , that he is to suffer no illusions , it was really for the sake of his wisdom that she made the difficult trip . The people turn their eyes on the King , who handles the awkward moment with skill ; he clears his throat on schedule , and raises his hand in the usual gesture , admonishing silence . But nothing comes . In the official account of the visit , which Solomon had written to order , he was supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . . . which he told her not . And when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he had built , and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants . . etc. , there was no more spirit in her . And she said to the King , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land , of thy acts and thy wisdom . Howbeit , I believed not the words , until I came and mine eyes had seen it ; and behold , the half was not told me : Thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which 1 heal d Happy are thy men . . . which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom . After which there was supposed to have been a further exchange of compliments and gifts . Now this is not only a bit thick , it gets round the question of Solomon 's wisdom . What did the King say , when put to it by the Queen ? That there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were round ? That the number of stars visible on a clear night from a point well out of town was neither more nor less than a certain number ? Did he advise her what to take for colds , give her a recipe for salad dressing , or speak of building temples and ships ? Just what does a man say under the circumstances ? Certainly , he had n't the nerve , the gall , to repeat the abominable invention to her face of the two women who disputed motherhood of a child . She would have seen through it right away . And surely he knew this was not the time to quote his sayings ; besides , he always had trouble remembering them . Then what did he say ? His economists had worked up a report on the Land of Sheba . He may have sent for a copy ; more likely , he knew the essential facts cold , and spoke what came to mind : industry , agriculture , natural resources . Of the financial structure , the public debt , the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil , especially oil . Grant him his wisdom . Certainly , the Queen was impressed , but one nccd not suppose that the spirit was knocked out of her or that she said , " It was a true report that I heard in mine own land ... " etc . Chances are , she paid no attention to his words ( except to note the drift ) but watched him as he spoke , taking in the cut of his beard , the fit of his clothes , and wondering , betimes , what sort of man he was . She saw his initial uncertainty give way and his confidence grow as he reached the meaty part of his delivery . And all along , she observed how he drew on the admiring glances of his girls , soaked up their adoration , as they lay open-mouthed on couches and rugs at his feet , all criticism suspended , incapacitated by love . Love ringed him round , love sustained him , he was the splendid heart of their hearts . She must have forgotten the heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lapped from all sides and borne gently afloat . ... S 0 MUCH , one may imagine . But the Queen spent a number of days or weeks perhaps even a month or two in the King 's company , and of what happened during the time of her stay , let alone the subsequent events of the first night , the official chronicles say nothing . A merciful omission , according to the counselors , who report that it went badly from the start . When the King had finished his discourse , they say the Queen felt called upon to answer . But words failed her , or she felt no nccd of words : she was the Queen . What she did was to lean forward and , in utter disregard of the company , take his head into her hands , gaze at him for a long time with a smile on her thick lips , and at last bestow on him a kiss , which landed somewhere in his beard . Then she jumped onto the table , commanded music , and danced among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The counselors were shocked , the girls smirked painfully , the servants held their breath . Nor was Sheba so slender as the autographed picture may have led one to believe . When she set her feet down , the table shook , and the carafes of wine and sweetened water swayed and threatened to topple . Solomon himself hastily cleared a way for her , pushing the dishes to one side ; his hands were trembling . But she proceeded with the dance , the chain anklets tinkled , her fingers snapped , the many jewels she wore flashed wealthily . Her toes left marks on the tablecloth , as though animals had run there . And run she did , back and forth over the length of the table . bending over the counselors to tweak this one 's nose and that one 's ear . But always she glanced back to see if she had the King 's eye . She had it , darker than usual . To her , this meant that he was admiring her , gravely , as befits King and Queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already she felt the King 's love , harder than any courtier 's and so much more severe . She increased the tempo , the musicians scrambling to keep up with her , and whirled . Round and round she sped , drawing nearer the end of the table where the King sat . It was a dance in the style of her country , un-known in these parts , and she did it with the abandon of a tribesgirl , though one must assume she was conscious , in her abandonment , that it was she , the Queen , none other than Sheba , who abandoned herself to King Solomon . That was the whole point of it , the mastery of the thing . Pride did not leave her face , it entered her ecstasy and raised it in degree . Already cries , guttural , impersonal , were barking in her throat ; then with a final whoop she spun round and threw herself , arms outstretched and intertwined , like one bound captive , to fall before him on the table where his meal had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counselors knew the King so much better than she , and their hearts went out in pity . The Queen had offered herself in the only way she knew  --  majesty , power , and reign implied  --  throwing herself prone with a condescending crash for the King to rise and take her . What presumption ! He did not move . He sat infinitely removed , almost sorrowing over this great em -- barrassment . The music had stopped , there was an unbearable silence in the banquet hall . The King rumbled something deep in his beard ; perhaps he was merely clearing- his threat , preparatory to saying a few words ( if only his wisdom did not fail him ! ) . Some of the servants took it to mean more wine , others , more meat , stillothers , fingerbowls . They ran in all directions . Sheba lowered herself into her seat at the King 's side . Her dark face burned . . . . Somehow the time went by , and the evening was over . Solomon led Sheba off to his chamber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was apparent that she still went in hope ; even at the last moment . The older women wept . D AY by day , the strain mounted . Sheba was sometimes with the King , they played chess or listened to the radio , they bent their heads over maps , discussed politics , and played croquet . But there were no festivities and she did not dance again . She bore herself with dignity , but she had grown pale , and her smile , when she forgot herself , was cringing and meek . Sometimes , when she was alone , she was seen to run her finger over the table tops and the woodwork , looking for dust . She could not bear the sight of her waiting women  --  lest the revival of her hope , as they did her toilet , become apparent to them  --  and would chase them out of the room ; only to call them back , and help her prepare for an audience with the King . Finally , she quarreled with some of the girls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day had come and she began to pack . A pinochle game was in progress when the Queen of Sheba , unannounced and without knocking , came into the room to say she wanted a word with the King . He dismissed his counselors , but one of them swears he managed to hide behind the draperies , where he witnessed the scene . The King was in his undershirt , smoking a cigar . He apologized for his dishevelment and offered to repair it . The affairs of state , he explained , were so trying lately , he found he worked better in dishabille . Had he been working ? asked the Queen with a smile . She thought this was some sort of game , and she fingered the cards with pictures of kings and queens . Solomon , knowing that women do not play pinochle , told her the cabinet had been in extraordinary session , trying fortunes with the picture cards . The times were good , but one must look to the future , and he offered to show her how it was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said the Queen of Sheba , " 1 beg only a few words . " " Speak , " said Solomon . " Solumon , Solomon , " said the Queen , " 1 am going away . No , do n't answer me . You will say something polite and regretful , but my decision can only be a relief to you . " She paused , taking on courage . " You must not allow this to be a disappointment to you , you must let me take the whole expense of our emotion upon myself . I did a foolish thing . I am a proud woman , being a Queen , and my pride carried me too far . I thought I would take pride in transcending pride , in offering myself to the King . But still that was pride , you did wisely to refuse me . Yes , you are wise , Solomon , let no one question your wisdom . Yours is the wisdom of love , which is the highest . But your love is love only of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you  --  and this is next to the highest . Either way you look at it , Solomon is wise enough . Understand me ? " She took a step forward , a dance step , as though she were again on the table top , but her eyes spoke a different meaning . " I am not pleading with you that you love me or allow me to love you . For you are the King , your taking is your giving . But allow me to say , your power rests on despair . Yours is the power of drawing love , the like of which has not been seen . But you despair of loving with your own heart . I have come to tell the King he must not despair . Surely , Solomon who has built temples and made the desert flourish is a powerful king , and he has the power to do what the simplest slave girl or washerwoman of his harem can do  --  to love with his own heart . And if he does not have this power , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is his nature to call forth in everyone , especially in us poor women . This is his glory . Rejoice in it , 0 King , for you are the King ! " The counselor who hid behind the drapes said he regretted his action , to see how his King stood burdened before the Queen . His own heart filled with loving shame . Solomon looked lost , deprived of his power , as though the years in the palace and the garden had never been . He made an effort to stand dignified in his undershirt , he bore his head as though he were wearing the crown , but it was pitiful to see him . " The Queen is wise , " said he . Then he broke down , and the counselor did not hear his next words . He did hear him say that the Queen was magnificent , that she had the courage of lions and tigers .. but by now his head was lowered . Suddenly , he clasped the Queen to his breast in an embrace of farewell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not immediately take leave of each other , but went on to speak of other matters . Before the Queen of Sheba left the country , King Solomon had leased her oil lands for ninety-nine years . But on the day of her departure , he stood bareheaded in the crowded courtyard to watch her set out , with her trumpeters and archers mounted on supercilious camels . He extended his hand to help her up , and she , with her free hand , chucked him under the chin . Then she leaned out of the howdah to cry , " Long live the King ! " King Solomon stood with bowed head to receive the ovation . Now more than ever they yearned for him . When Sheba moved off , at the head of the procession , Solomon led the people onto the roof , to watch the camels file across the sand . He stood till evening fell , and the rump of the last plodding animal had twitched out of sight beyond the sand hills . Then he averted his face and wept silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WITH HIS FATHERS S 0 TH F counselors have a point when they say the standards have fallen . Once the Queen of Sheba herself was unable to make it ; and now , look . But no wonder , her like will not come again , and besides , Solomon is old . He has been running the country forty years , and has begun to speak of retiring ; but the people know he will never retire , and so they whisper , it is time for the King to die . How does this strike him ? To look at him  --  his beard is white , his spotted hands shake , he walks bent , his eyes are rheumy and dim  --  to look at him one would suppose he dwells on the thought of death . But he is no better known now than he was in his prime . The only certainty is that the King is old . But what follows from this , how does it reveal him ? Or this ? ? that he had an attack of pleurisy not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what does it mean to say that he now has more women than ever ch  --  tering up the palace , one thousand in all , including seven hundred wives ? ( Is it merely that the standards have fallen ? ) It was necessary to tear down the harem ( while the women , to everyone 's displeasure , were quartered in the town ) and raise a new building , so large it has taken up ground formerly allotted to the garden . They are a great source of trouble to him , these women , and the counselors complain  --  that 's where all the money is going , to support the harem . Harem ? Why , it 's a whole population , the country will be ruined ! And the priests complain , every week they send fresh ultimatums , objecting to the fact that so many of Solomon 's girls are heathen ; they have even accused him of idolatry and threatened him with loss of the Kingdom and the wrath of God . And the people grumble , it 's a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or quarreling right out in the open , as they have begun to do , in the very streets . But Solomon ignores the discontent and goes on collecting women as he once collected stamps . Why ? Or what does this mean ? ? that he seldom takes the trouble to interview applicants , but establishes a policy for several months , during which time the rule is , no vacancies . Then he will change the rule and take on newcomers by the dozen , most of whom he does not even see , the work being done by the counselors . And how complicated the work has become , compared with the old days , when all that was necessary was for a girl to lie down beside the King with her hands upon his breast . Now there are forms to fill out and letters of recommendation to obtain , several interviews and a medical examination to go through , and even then the girls must wait until their references have been checked . The filing cabinets have mounted to the ceiling . What sense does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The counselors vouch for it , they swear they have seen the proof . That King Solomon now takes to bed , not with a virgin , as his father , David , did in his old age , or even with a dancing girl , but with a ? hot water bottle . If this report is true , then does n't something follow ? For this is the extreme , between life and death , where all thoughts meet ; an extreme , not a mean ; and a wrong guess is impossible , everything is true , as at the topmost point , where all direction is down . It follows that he warms his hands on the water bottle , presses it to his cheek , passes it down along his belly . MAGAZINE Now when he thinks of his prime , he of all men must wonder : what was the glory of the King ? Who bestowed the power , and what did it consist in ? When he had it , he did not consider , and now it is gone . Passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toes for warmth , he sees he did everything possible in his life , and left no possibility untouched , of manhood , statesmanship , love . What else can a man do ? There is no answer . Except to say , he was in God 's grace then ? And now no longer ? Or is he still in a state of grace , witness the , water bottle at his feet ? And perhaps he is only being tried , and may look forward to even greater rewards ? Such are the advantages of being a believer . If he were one , he would know  --  at least . believe that he knew . But a man who knows only that once love was with him , which now is no more  --  what does he know , what shall he believe , old , exhausted , shivering alone in bed at night with a hot water bottle , when all 's quiet in the palace ? And if all 's not quiet , that 's no longer his concern . No , if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sleep . But sleep does not come . He hears strange noises in the apartment , scratching . . . . Mice ? He must remember to speak to the caretakers . . . At last he drowses off , to sleep a while . And if he does not sleep ? Or later , when he wakes , and it is still the same night ? ... Does he think of the Queen of Sheba and wonder , whom is she visiting now ? Does he remember how she danced upon the table ? Or the song he wrote soon after her departure , with her words still fresh in his mind , when he resolved to pour out his love for her , but from the very first line poured out , instead , her love for him ? Let him kiss rue with the kisses of his mouth , for thy love is better than wine . It has been years since he heard from her . . Meanwhile , the bottle has grown cold . Shall he ring for another ? He shifts the bottle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young hart upon the mountains of spices . Look forward ; look back , to darkness , at the light , both ways blind . He raises the bottle to his breast ; it does not warm him . He gropes for the cord , and while his hand reaches , he thinks , as he has thought so many times , there is a time and a season for everything , a time to be born and a time to die . Is it time now ? They will lay him out , washed , anointed , shrouded . They will fold his arms across his chest , with the palms turned in , completing the figure . Now his own hands will lie pressed to his breast , and he will sleep with his fathers .
