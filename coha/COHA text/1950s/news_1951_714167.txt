txt Last week 's successful conference at Ottawa made two specific advances . First , in a frank exchange of views , it tightened to some extent the integration of the North Atlantic Pact nations . Second , in ' he vote to admit Greece and Lo the organization it broadened base and the concept of the joint action of free peoples . Under the steady pressure of an external threat the strategy of collective security is jadually being hammered out . was originally supposed that the iitlikniework of the United Nations would Stlitomutically provide for that security . A was the concern of all , and presurnaNv their agreement upon a single ineftrument , the United Nations Charter , provided for the safety of individual member states . Events have belied that hope . It has been necessary to set up , within the boundaries of the international agreement , further pacts and understandings designed to meet the now open threat to liberty and safety . This process has necessarily led to the concept of regional security , in the physical sense , as opposed to total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy changed from the effort to work from the whole to the component parts to one of building a set of components out of which a whole could eventually emerge . Out of that change came first the Truman Doctrine and out of it the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was born . It has now been found necessary to make a further regional disposition of strength to flank the Atlantic states . It is recognized that the Mediterranean can involve a threat to the Atlantic and that the eastern reaches of the sea are a pivotal point . Thus Greece and Turkey become logically necessary to security planning for areas other than merely themselves . Common danger and common sense dictate this extension of our planning . Turkey , however , is more than a bastion . It is a bridge . It is reasonable , therefore , to view the question of the Turkish security position in relation to the whole Middle East . With this in mind , a somewhat changed center of gravity for the Eastern Mediterranean command is being closely conside ? ed . Turkey must point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . The whole of the Islamic world , from Morocco to Indonesia , is affected by the eventual security of Turkey at the strategic keystone of the arch . Meanwhile , as GovernorDeweypointed out to the American Ear Association last week , we are approaching this problem of regional security also from the Pacific side . We have concluded Jeiense pacts with Australia , New Zealand and the Philippines . We have tried to make provision against a potential power vacuum in Japan . We are assuming , as it was assumed at Ottawa , that the component parts of this collective security pattern can also be enlarged and integrated . Governor Dewey believes that there should be no delay on this point . He said : " Specifically , I believe that it is vital to the defense of the United Slates and the continued existence of the free world that we start immediately to build a well-rounded and complete Pacific Mutual Defense Alliance . " Such an organized defense is not conceived as a rival to the claims of the Atlantic area . It is not proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Immediate considerations will have to dictate material priorities , just as they did in 1942 . But immediate considerations need not dictate the fragmentation of the concept total defense against total danger . is rather hoped that a stronger posit in Asia will be reflected in a stronger position in Europe and vice versa . It was with this in mind that Governor Dewey said : " We have gone so far along the road of collective security that it would be a tragedy to go SO per cent of the way and fail because we neglected to achieve the final and vital 20 per cent . " This is the link between Ottawa and San Francisco , between Rome and Manila , Paris and Singapore , London and Tokyo . The evolving strategy of collective security is designed to make it truly collective . The physical goal is being approached on a regional basis . The spiritual goal of true agreement on the values that must he defended has already gone beyond the limitations of geography .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
