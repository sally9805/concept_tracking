txt A Brooklyn grand jtiry investigating . rackets is looking into the possibility , of grand larceny in fund raising for police war veterans ' organizations . Some of these groups are reported to have received only 25 per cent of the proceeds of benefit affairs . The fund-raising aspect is expected to reveal by far the most lucrative part of a racket that assertedly included the sale of ' courtesy cards " to protect traffic offenders . The fact that District Attorney Edward S. Silver and Assistant District Attorneys Julius Helland and ' Thomas J. Donlan of Brooklyn were working on the grand larceny angle became clear for the first time yesterday . That aspect had been mentioned in affidavits filed by Mr. Donlan Nov. 9 but heretofore kept secret . In filing the affidavits Mr. Donlan asked Kings County Judge Samuel S. Leibowitz for warrants to search the homes of six persons being held as material witnesses . The Brooklyn official said he ' wanted to look for tickets to police veterans ' benefits and for papers related to fund-raising in which solicitation had been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspect Noted Mr. Donlan 's affidavits went on to say that " this investigation is concerned with the illegal withholding and larceny of funds from the sale of tickets for various police posts in the Veterans of Foreign Wars , American Legion , and Army and Navy Union , United States of America , and other service organizations and veterans ' police organizations . " The grand jury has " clear-cut evidence " and the " testimony of more than one man " that operators of the racket received as much as 75 per cent of the proceeds of public donations and sale of tickets to benefit socials of the police veterans ' groups , Mr. Donlan said . But there was ' no indication of the extent of the practice , or how many organizations were affected . Whether a basis for a grand larceny indictment existed also was uncertain , but Mr. Don- ' Ian insisted there were " sufff- ' cient grounds " for including this angle in the investigation . - As he explained the racket , a ' police veterans ' group would give ' fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half of all donations the fund raisers obtained , The donations from the public were to be made by check , thus providing a record of the receipts ostensibly obtained for the tickets . Actually , said , Mr. Donlan , the racketeer received half of the , donation as a commission , and was free to pocket proceeds of any tickets , he actually sold . Thus , for example , a fundraiser might get 2,000 tickets // marked for sale at $1 each , In some instances , he would solicit $2,000 in donations , apart from the tickets , and wouldeultimately receive half of the donations as a commission . Then , said Mr. Donlan , he might pocket the proceeds of the actual sale of the tickets . If he sold all 2 ; 000 , he would have obtained an aggregate of $3,000 , compared to $1,000 that the organization received . ' No Penny-Ante Situation ' It was presumably to this operation that Mr. Helfand referred last Nov. 10 at the arraignment of ? material witnesses when he said : " This is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination as a prosecutor familiar with criminality in the police situation , " Mr. Helfand played a leading role in the investigation and prosecution of the multi-million-dollar police graft scandal involving Harry Gross , bookmaker . Mr. Helfand also has said that tickets to veterans ' social affairs " literally in the thousands ' have been printed in advance for years to come , " adding , " whether the - affairs ever will be held is unknown . " He said at the time of the arraignment that one civilian , a material witness with " no other means of income except sale of tickets and cards , " had bankbooks showing $50,000 in deposits in the " last few years , " a " vast amount of war bonds " and three safe deposit boxes , Although the ticket sale aspect was revealed ' two weeks ago , the first mention of a grand larceny ' investigation of it came when Mr. Donlan 's affidavits were made public yesterday . The asserted ticket racket obviously could be conducted on a greater magnitude and with consequently larger profit than the courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity for traffic law offenders was sold for $10 and up . Mr. Silver contended that at least 100 motorcycle and patrol car police in the city and suburban areas were involved in the racket . Sulick Hearing ' Slated One of the suburban policemen , Nicholas Sulick of Westchester County ; has been suspended for refusing to sign a. waiver of , immunity , which would ' permit his grand jury testimony to be used against him . He was scheduled to get a hearing today at 10 A. M. at Hawthorne , N , Y. , before Commissioner Orie R. Kelly of the Westchester County Park Police . One of his attorneys has said Patrolman Sundt might resign rather than fight the case , Two Yonkers policemen resigned from their force after considering a costly legal fight against dismissal for refusal to waive immunity before the Kings County grand jury . Frederick E. Weeks Jr. , chief assistant district attorney in Westchester ; said yesterday he had questioned six of twenty-five motorists whose names had been found in Sulick 's papers . Mr. Helfand said twelve civilians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday . He will appear in court twice Monday to argue against legal moves to free Donald Goodrich , whom he called the " center or core " of one of the largest groups in the case . Goodrich , a suspended city motorcycle policeman , IS being held as a material witness . At 10 A , M. , in Kings County Court , Mr. Helfand will argue against an order to show why a search warrant obtained ' against Goodrich should not be invalidated . At 2 P. M. , in Supreme Court , Manhattan , a writ of habeas corpus obtained by Mrs. Goodrich is returnable . She charged ' that her ' husband had been illegally committed to New York County civil prison with bail set excessively by Judge Leibowitz at $50,000 ,
